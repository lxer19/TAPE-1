Abstract: 2 This paper presents a method for interpolating a sparse set of velocity measurements on the surface of a vibrating structure. The method is based on a novel integration of a physical model of the vibrating structure with an optimal signal recovery technique. The ability to achieve good interpolation performance with a small set of sensors makes this method important for many active noise control applications where an accurate measure of structural surface velocity is required to predict the radiated acoustic field. To demonstrate the applicability of this method in active control applications, a sample experiment is performed and results presented.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, a destructive interference field generated by a control sound source is made to cancel components of the primary sound field. Comprehensive references on active noise control are available in excellent reviews given in references <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. A variation of this approach is to actively control the vibration of a noisy structure directly to reduce its radiated sound.

Reference-contexts: This technique, referred to as Active Structural Acoustics Control (ASAC), has been a major topic of research in recent years.

In many applications, it is impractical to place pressure sensors within the field of interest.

Reference-contexts: This section demonstrates the utility of this paper's model-based interpolation technique for this type of active noise control problem. To begin, the plate model described in the previous section was assumed to lay within an infinite ba*e. A discretized form of the Rayleigh intergral, similar to that described in <ref> [4] </ref> was used to model and predict the radiated sound field from this plate. The far-field pressure field was sampled at 325 equally spaced points over a hemisphere 100 meters in radius.

Reference-contexts: In addition, sensors are often too expensive to permit a dense laydown on a structure. To overcome these difficulties, non-uniform interpolation methods can be used to estimate the dense set of measurements needed for ASAC. Some of the most popular interpolation approaches include band-limited interpolation and various spline techniques <ref> [7] </ref>. The spline interpolators make few assumptions about the 1 signal of interest, and are therefore appropriate when little is known about the signal generation source. The band-limited interpolators work well for signals with a known finite frequency bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: In each case, the actuator locations were selected using a multidimensional QR-based actuator selection algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. The placement algorithm seeks to place the actuators to minimize the the residual noise in the sound field. These actuators were then used to compute the performance of the active control system. The methodology presented in this paper was compared against the linear interpolation and the cubic interpolation techniques.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we have devised a methodology for interpolating a sparse nonuniform set of structural surface velocities that can be used to accurately estimate the acoustic field for ASAC.

Reference-contexts: In vector form, this can be expressed as v = Yf ; (9) where Y is the structural mobility matrix. The mobility matrix Y can be written in terms of the modal response of the structure <ref> [11] </ref> as Y = i! r=1 r r ! 2 + i r ! 2 ; (10) where the subscript r refers to the rth mode, r is the mass-normalized modal displacement vector, ! r is the natural frequency, r is the damping loss factor associated with the rth mode, and <p> The particular finite element code used in this work was based on the Kirchhoff plate theory <ref> [11] </ref>. Each element has four nodes, and three degrees of freedom at each node. These degrees of freedom are transverse displacement and two out-of-plane rotations along the axes of the element.

For these other cases, the interested reader is referred to Burnside and Parks <ref> [12] </ref>. III. MODEL-BASED INTERPOLATION OF SURFACE VELOCITIES The formulation of the interpolation method in Section II applies to a broad class of linear transformations on a bounded input (Ax = b with a bound on x). <p> Also, the interpolation technique should be extended to include other types of bounds on the excitation forces (e.g., individual bounds on each point force). Preliminary work has been completed in this direction <ref> [12] </ref>. 9
