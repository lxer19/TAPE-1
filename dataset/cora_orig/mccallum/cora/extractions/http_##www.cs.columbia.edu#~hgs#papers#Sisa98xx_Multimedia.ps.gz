Abstract: The Multimedia Internet Terminal (MINT) 1 is a flexible multimedia tool set that allows the establishment and control of multimedia sessions across the Internet. The system architecture is fully distributed, with no central components. For each participant, a coordinating application manages a set of loosely coupled media and control agents. Using the coordinating application, session members can control the sending and receiving of several audio and video streams, invite other users to the session and negotiate the order in which members are allowed speak. The different components of MINT are separate processes that are independent from one another, yet can easily communicate with each other using a simple interprocess communication protocol based on local multicast. Individual components can be replaced without affecting the operation of other components. The same media agents can be used in applications ranging from media-on-demand retrieval to Internet telephony and distance learning, simply by using different control tools. To improve the quality of service of the multimedia sessions MINT is enhanced with a suite of QoS control mechanisms including resource reservation based on RSVP, adaptive media control and the ability to send video data in hierarchically layered streams. Thus, the tool set can accommodate a range of capabilities and available network bandwidths in heterogeneous environments.

Reference-contexts: As extending any of the two tools to support the other's compression style was a non-trivial task, both tools were non-interoperable. More recent tools such as VIC [22] support both hardware and software compression engines and offer better performance. VIC supports a limited form of interaction with the VAT <ref> [1] </ref> audio tool: VAT can signal speaker activity through a mechanism similar to the conference bus. The speaker activity indication then selects which site is displayed in full size. There has also been some work concerning synchronizing audio and video based on VIC and VAT [20].

Reference-contexts: The integrated service model [3] has been proposed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the standardization body of the Internet. It allows end systems to reserve the amount of resources needed to fulfill their requirements. On the other hand, various adaptation schemes <ref> [2, 5, 23] </ref> are being discussed that adjust the end system requirements to the current congestion state of the network. MINT can benefit from both approaches, as it implements the resource reservation (RSVP) protocol for establishing guaranteed QoS reservations and supports several adaptation schemes in the video agents.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the audio and video agents, MINT includes agents for floor control and quality-of-service (QoS) control. QoS control: The Internet currently supports only best-effort service. To allow for an improved QoS, two different approaches are currently being discussed. The integrated service model <ref> [3] </ref> has been proposed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the standardization body of the Internet. It allows end systems to reserve the amount of resources needed to fulfill their requirements.

Reference-contexts: The IETF has recently standardized RSVP <ref> [39, 4] </ref> as the protocol for setting up reserved sessions. When using RSVP as a QoS signaling protocol, participating end systems establish a closed control loop. The senders inform the network and receivers about their traffic characteristics by sending PATH packets.

A detailed description for such an approach and some results for different network topologies can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. We have also been considering other approaches that are less oscillatory [34] and others that are more friendly towards TCP connections [35]. Currently, the adaptation schemes we are working on are only implemented in NEVIT.

Reference-contexts: Currently, IP multicast is deployed in the Internet as an overlay network referred to as the MBone <ref> [6, 9] </ref>. However, most local networks also support multicast. Following convention, we refer to tools operating in this environment as MBone tools, although they all can use any multicast-capable IP network and all can operate in unicast mode. The protocol stack for Internet multimedia is shown in Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: Other examples include quality of service control, automatically displaying the video from those conference participants that are currently talking or using the display coordinates of video windows to control artificial spatial placement of the audio from individual speakers (artificial stereo, holophony) <ref> [7, 19, 21] </ref>. In [27], a communication protocol called Pattern Matching Multicast (PMM) is introduced that can be used to start and terminate media agents.

Reference-contexts: The name PMM derives from the property that messages are not addressed to a particular agent, but rather to a group of agents that have expressed interest in partic ular commands or events. Just as in the IP host group model <ref> [8] </ref>, senders do not need to be aware which, if any, agent is interested in processing the PMM message. A single message may trigger actions in zero or more agents.

Reference-contexts: A major issue that we have not been able to handle yet, is the support of application sharing. For the distribution of slides and joint editing we are still using the WB <ref> [10] </ref> white board from LBNL. As the application is only available in binary format we are not able of integrating it into MINT. However, the task of supporting application sharing will be one our major future goals.

While both of these tools were intended for supporting low bit-rate multicast over the Internet, they choose different compression algorithms and video representations.

Reference-contexts: Prospective participants can either discover sessions on their own or be explicitly invited. Participant-directed discovery includes listening to session announcements being distributed via mechanisms such as a well-known multicast address <ref> [12] </ref> or web pages with listings of events and on-demand multimedia streams. Announcements via multicast or email lists are only appropriate for a relatively small number of pre-scheduled public sessions of wide interest.

Reference-contexts: The design of the Multimedia Internet Terminal (MINT) described here addresses some of these issues and incorporates some of the most recent proposals for solving these problems. Handley et al. <ref> [13] </ref> summarizes some of the main issues related to the subject of multimedia communication over the Internet. Below, we describe how MINT addresses these issues.

Reference-contexts: The invited user can then join the session, reject the invitation or just forward the call to some other site. The invitation messages contain a description of the session using, for example, the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <ref> [14] </ref>. This protocol is used to describe the media types involved in the session, which coding styles to be used, some QoS parameters and additional information such as when to automatically invoke the session in the future.

Reference-contexts: Users could be invited explicitly via email, but the delay in delivery and reading makes telephony-like spontaneous or private conferences difficult. Recently, several proposals for sending invitations for multimedia sessions were developed <ref> [28, 15] </ref>. By locating the actual end systems the users are logged on and informing them about the session, the task of initiating multimedia sessions becomes much easier and resembles to some extent the old but reliable telephone system. <p> By locating the actual end systems the users are logged on and informing them about the session, the task of initiating multimedia sessions becomes much easier and resembles to some extent the old but reliable telephone system. MINT in cludes the latest version of the session initiation protocol (SIP) <ref> [15] </ref>. Thereby, users of MINT can invite other users in a simple way to join multimedia conferences. After accepting an invitation MINT initiates the needed startup procedures on their be half, thereby minimizing the complexity of using the system. <p> The moderator can select any of those waiting in line to speak by sending a message indicating his choice. Similarly, the floor is withdrawn with another message. A moderator might be selected through the conference control protocol, e.g., a session directory or conference invitation protocol (SIP) <ref> [15] </ref>. As Figure 5 shows, the floor controllers involved in a session negotiate which member receives the right to speak.

Reference-contexts: Currently, sdr typically advertises on the order of twenty upcoming and on-going sessions; with commercial use, the number could well be larger than the number of TV and radio stations, measured in the thousands. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <ref> [16, 29] </ref> being standardized within the IETF describes a method for inviting users to join a session. It also conveys the necessary information to the end system to configure the local media agents.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the rate is usually adapted to the worst receiver requirements, thereby reducing the quality of the data received at all receiving sites. To avoid these problems, various proposals have been made for hierarchical data distribution, for example <ref> [17, 23] </ref>. Those proposals are based on partitioning a data stream into a base layer, comprising the information needed to achieve the lowest quality representa tion and a number of enhancement layers. The different layers are then sent to different multicast sessions. <p> This is the simplest form of data layering that entails only little added complexity to the end systems. Joining or leaving a session can either be controlled manually or using an approach similar to that described in <ref> [17] </ref> based on reserving enough resources for each layer before actually joining it. 6 Summary and Future Work In the work presented here, we described a multimedia tool (MINT) based on loosely integrated media agents with a central control entity.

Reference-contexts: By stripping VIC of its user interface and replacing it with a PMM message handling interface, we can use VIC as an integral part of MINT. We are also working on integrating MINT with a video conference recording tool called the MBone video conference recording on demand (MVCRoD) <ref> [18] </ref>. This would give the user the possibility of recording the audio and video streams generated during a conferencing session and playing them out later. A major issue that we have not been able to handle yet, is the support of application sharing.

Reference-contexts: Floor controllers maintain a time-ordered request list. We assume that time is synchronized across session participants to within a few seconds, as is easily accomplished using NTP <ref> [24] </ref>. Thus, each participant can decide indepen dently that it is her turn to speak. Moderated sessions: In a moderated session, there is a central moderator that assigns the right to speak to all the requesting members in a centralized way.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we describe the different parts of the MINT. Currently, MINT consists of a video media agent (NeViT) [36], an audio media agent (NEVOT) <ref> [26] </ref>, a session controller (ISC), and invitation, reservation and floor control agents. Section 5 then describes different approaches for providing quality of service, namely resource reservation, rate adaptation and hierarchical data transmission. <p> The protocol stack for Internet multimedia is shown in Fig. 1. Most of the current available MBone tools such as VIC [22], VAT, rat [20], or NEVOT <ref> [26] </ref> use the real time transport protocol (RTP) [31] designed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). RTP is now widely used for conferencing, as well as emerging applications such as Internet telephony and Internet media-on-demand services. <p> of 50 yields a data rate of about 1-1.5 Mb/s.) In addition to that, NEVIT is capable of sending and receiving MPEG-1 video streams using the hardware codec on the SunVideo card for compression and the Berkeley MPEG library to handle the decompression. 4.3 The Network Voice Terminal (NEVOT) NEVOT <ref> [26] </ref> is an audio tool that allows the user to join different audio sessions simultaneously. It has only a minimal control interface and is mainly configured using ISC.

Reference-contexts: The different agents constituting MINT can communicate with each other using a simple control protocol, based on local multicast, called Pattern Matching Multicast (PMM) <ref> [27] </ref>. This gives the user the impression of having a monolithic tool, that consists, however, of separate components that can be easily replaced, upgraded or adapted to new applications. <p> Other examples include quality of service control, automatically displaying the video from those conference participants that are currently talking or using the display coordinates of video windows to control artificial spatial placement of the audio from individual speakers (artificial stereo, holophony) [7, 19, 21]. In <ref> [27] </ref>, a communication protocol called Pattern Matching Multicast (PMM) is introduced that can be used to start and terminate media agents.

Reference-contexts: If the loss rate drops below some predefined threshold, the source increases its rate additively. A detailed description for such an approach and some results for different network topologies can be found in [5]. We have also been considering other approaches that are less oscillatory <ref> [34] </ref> and others that are more friendly towards TCP connections [35]. Currently, the adaptation schemes we are working on are only implemented in NEVIT.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we describe the architecture of the Multimedia Internet Terminal (MINT) in detail, as well as the protocol used for the communication between the different agents. In Section 4, we describe the different parts of the MINT. Currently, MINT consists of a video media agent (NeViT) <ref> [36] </ref>, an audio media agent (NEVOT) [26], a session controller (ISC), and invitation, reservation and floor control agents. Section 5 then describes different approaches for providing quality of service, namely resource reservation, rate adaptation and hierarchical data transmission.

Reference-contexts: Updating this interface to UNI 4.0 will be one of our future tasks. 4.2.3 Video Handling Currently, NEVIT only supports the SunVideo card for capturing and compressing video images. The card supports JPEG, MPEG, CellB and YUV video <ref> [37] </ref> in hardware. NEVIT on the other hand, provides the appropriate algorithms for decompressing and displaying JPEG, MPEG and YUV video images. The JPEG decoder was ported from the VIC video tool.

Reference-contexts: starting multimedia sessions with MINT is shorter than that needed to learn all the different tools used currently in the Internet multimedia conferences. 4.2 The Network Video Tool (NEVIT) The first MBone video tools were the Xerox PARC Network Video tool (nv) [11] and the INRIA video Conferencing System (ivs) <ref> [38] </ref>. While both of these tools were intended for supporting low bit-rate multicast over the Internet, they choose different compression algorithms and video representations. As extending any of the two tools to support the other's compression style was a non-trivial task, both tools were non-interoperable.

Reference-contexts: The IETF has recently standardized RSVP <ref> [39, 4] </ref> as the protocol for setting up reserved sessions. When using RSVP as a QoS signaling protocol, participating end systems establish a closed control loop. The senders inform the network and receivers about their traffic characteristics by sending PATH packets.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the daemon can multicast a search request on the local network or might use an existing protocol such as the finger protocol <ref> [40] </ref>. (We have experimented with a recursive version of that protocol, making use of the fact that the finger protocol returns the host where the user last logged in from and following that lead.) Many other methods are conceivable, depending on system capabilities.
