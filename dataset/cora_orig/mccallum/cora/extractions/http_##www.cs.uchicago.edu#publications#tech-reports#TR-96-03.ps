Abstract: We present an implemented system which integrates elements of run-time planning, context-based vision, passive mapping, path planning, and route following. We consider navigation as a part of a larger system which accomplishes realistic everyday tasks in addition to map learning and path planning. Whereas previous approaches assume an unknown and unstructured environment, we assume a structured environment whose organization is known, but whose specifics are unknown. We base the system's navigation on a passive mapper which monitors sensor and actuator events to create a topological map. This map consists of distinctive places and connecting edges. At each place the agent stores relevant perceptual information important for accomplishing tasks and/or disambiguating places. The agent uses the map to select a destination and plan a route to follow. A route follower verifies location predictions by matching past perception with current perception. The agent is endowed with a wide range of visual capabilities as well as search plans for informed exploration of a simulated store constructed from real visual data. We demonstrate the agent finding items while mapping the world. In repeatedly retrieving items, the agent's performance improves as the learned map becomes more useful to its recurring goals.

Reference-contexts: This involves computing local feature vectors over each grid in an image. These features could be texture, color, dominant edge direction, etc. Our particular implementation uses color histograms and edge orientation histograms. * Steerable Filters Vectors of steerable filters <ref> (Freeman and Adelson, 1991) </ref> are used as opportunistic object detectors. Rao and Ballard (1995) have shown these filters to be useful for object recognition. All of the above vision algorithms have been implemented and can be used by Shopper.
