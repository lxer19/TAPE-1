Abstract: The quality of available network connections can often have a large impact on the performance of distributed applications. For example, document transfer applications such as FTP, Gopher and the World Wide Web suffer increased response times as a result of network congestion. For these applications, the document transfer time is directly related to the available bandwidth of the connection. Available bandwidth depends on two things: 1) the underlying capacity of the path from client to server, which is limited by the bottleneck link; and 2) the amount of other traffic competing for links on the path. If measurements of these quantities were available to the application, the current utilization of connections could be calculated. Network utilization could then be used as a basis for selection from a set of alternative connections or servers, thus providing reduced response time. Such a dynamic server selection scheme would be especially important in a mobile computing environment in which the set of available servers is frequently changing. In order to provide these measurements at the application level, we introduce two tools: bprobe, which provides an estimate of the uncongested bandwidth of a path; and cprobe, which gives an estimate of the current congestion along a path. These two measures may be used in combination to provide the application with an estimate of available bandwidth between server and client thereby enabling application-level congestion avoidance. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of our probe tools, specifically illustrating the techniques used to achieve accuracy and robustness. We present validation studies for both tools which demonstrate their reliability in the face of actual Internet conditions; and we give results of a survey of available bandwidth to a random set of WWW servers as a sample application of our probe technique. We conclude with descriptions of other applications of our measurement tools, several of which are currently under development.

Reference-contexts: The line fitting is done by hand and a very large number of packets are needed to make manual fitting possible. An expanded version of that paper gives preliminary suggestions as to how this process can be used to determine the makeup of interfering traffic <ref> [1] </ref>. However, many obstacles exist to the automatic application 2 of this idea in real networks. Our work overcomes these obstacles and results in a robust procedure that can calculate the bottleneck link speed with minimal overhead. <p> This well-known effect is illustrated in the familiar diagram shown in Figure 3 (adapted from Van Jacobson [5]). In addition, Bolot describes the basic effect in <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and Keshav has used a similar method in networks of Rate-Allocating servers [6]. The goal of the bprobe tool is to create this condition and to use it to make reliable measurements.

Reference-contexts: We present the results of a survey of WWW servers and discuss the implications of our findings for replication and server selection. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing and future work. 1.1 Related Work In <ref> [2] </ref>, the author gives a model for packet travel through links and routers along a connection in the Internet. The bandwidth of the bottleneck link is studied by comparing the round-trip times (rtt) of adjacent packets from a sequence sent at regular intervals. <p> This well-known effect is illustrated in the familiar diagram shown in Figure 3 (adapted from Van Jacobson [5]). In addition, Bolot describes the basic effect in <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and Keshav has used a similar method in networks of Rate-Allocating servers [6].

Reference-contexts: In contrast, we assume the conditions prevalent in the current Internet, which are much less tractable, and we require only that packets not be reordered in transit. Treno <ref> [3] </ref> is a tool from Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center that emulates a TCP connection including slow-start and necessary retransmissions. They have set up a Web-based server that measures the path back to the calling client.

Reference-contexts: The servers were chosen uniformly from a list obtained from [7]. Previously, we performed a similar survey primarily concerned with the distribution of hops and latency to WWW Servers <ref> [4] </ref>. During the latest survey we gathered these statistics in addition to bandwidth estimates. For the set of 5825 servers, Figure 16 presents the distribution of hops (measured by traceroute) and Figure 17 gives the distribution of latencies (measured by ping).

During the latest survey we gathered these statistics in addition to bandwidth estimates. For the set of 5825 servers, Figure 16 presents the distribution of hops (measured by traceroute) and Figure 17 gives the distribution of latencies (measured by ping). As discussed in [4] the striking difference between the two distributions has implications for replica placement and server selection. In particular, the lack of correlation between the two measures suggests that hops is a bad predictor of latency, and thus a bad metric for distance in an internetwork.

Reference-contexts: However, many obstacles exist to the automatic application 2 of this idea in real networks. Our work overcomes these obstacles and results in a robust procedure that can calculate the bottleneck link speed with minimal overhead. The author in <ref> [6] </ref>, defines the notion of a packet-pair, two back-to-back packets that travel from source to destination and result in two acknowledgment packets returning. The calculation of bandwidth based on the returning ACKs is similar to ours but in that work, a network of Rate-Allocating Servers (RAS) is assumed. <p> This well-known effect is illustrated in the familiar diagram shown in Figure 3 (adapted from Van Jacobson [5]). In addition, Bolot describes the basic effect in [1, 2] and Keshav has used a similar method in networks of Rate-Allocating servers <ref> [6] </ref>.
