Reference-contexts: implement Darwin's theory of natural selection and evolution, whereas we have supplemented Darwin's findings and hypotheses by examining two texts describing the debate, Cult Archaeology and Creationism: Understanding Pseudoscientific Beliefs about the Past and Evolution and the Myth of Creationism: A Basic Guide To the Facts in the Evolution Debate <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. By appealing to information from these books, we have updated Thagard's version of the problem into something more contemporary. The Two Theories To account for the existance of life forms present on Earth, there are two modern theories. <p> However, this list does contain many of the facts and findings used in the debates between the two theories. Some of this list was taken from or adapted from Thagard's implementation of the same problem in Echo [32] with supplements coming from <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. E1 Dating of the Earth and of fossils shows Earth to be 4.5 billion years old, first species appeared 3.5 billion years ago. <p> The remaining list of items are all findings discovered through archaeological research and paleontology <ref> [1] </ref>. Facts will be used as evidence for or against certain low level hypotheses. These low level hypotheses will be used to explain the findings above (E2 through E17).

Reference-contexts: Introduction Abduction is inference to the best explanation [20, 10]. This reasoning method is very useful in accomplishing a variety of tasks such as diagnosis, identification, and recognition <ref> [22, 24, 27, 26, 28, 25, 31, 2, 12] </ref>. However, it has also been used for solving theory formation and theory decision problems [32, 9, 18] We have developed a domain independent strategy for solving abductive problems.
