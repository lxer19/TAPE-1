Abstract: In most proposed architectures for Video-On-Demand (VOD) systems, the customers are serviced individually by allocating and dedicating a transmission channel and a set of video server resources to each customer. This approach leads to an expensive-to-operate, non-scalable system. We consider a VOD system that uses multicast delivery to service multiple customers with a single set of resources. The use of multicast requires that some interactivity and part of the on-demand nature of the system are sacrificed to achieve scalability and cost-effectiveness. Previous work has considered how VCR actions could be handled in this type of system through the provisioning of set-top box buffering. In this paper we consider a modification of the semantics of the VCR functions in order to avoid this buffering requirement. In particular we consider the provision of discontinuous VCR actions in which the duration of the action is specified in integer multiples of a specified time increment. We evaluate the performance of this system through the use of simulation and compare its performance with an individual delivery (unicast) system and a multicast system with continuous VCR actions.

Reference-contexts: The problem with this approach is that it leads to an expensive-to-operate, non-scalable system. Most VOD trials to-date have been geared toward servicing small groups of customers (see for example <ref> [1] </ref>). In these systems, as the number of customers increases, so must the number of video server resources and channels. One of the best ways to deliver information to more than one customer is through the use of multi-cast communication.

Reference-contexts: Previous work has addressed the provision of such systems through the use of multicast communication (or batching) in which multiple customers with similar requests are serviced simultaneously <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. In previous work by the authors of this paper [2], we have considered a system that uses multicast communication to deliver video streams to multiple customers. <p> Previous work has addressed the provision of such systems through the use of multicast communication (or batching) in which multiple customers with similar requests are serviced simultaneously [2, 3]. In previous work by the authors of this paper <ref> [2] </ref>, we have considered a system that uses multicast communication to deliver video streams to multiple customers. A limited number of channels are available and customers are allocated channels (after being batched through a slotting mechanism) on a first-come, first-served basis. Customers that cannot be allocated channels are blocked. <p> We evaluate the performance of this system through the use of simulation 2 and compare its performance with that of a unicast system and of a multicast system with continuous VCR actions (as proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>). The idea of discontinuous VCR actions has been "floated" in various VOD system proposals. We are not, however, aware of any extensive performance study of such a system and in particular how its performance compares to various other alternatives. The paper is organized as follows. <p> Since this set-top box only allows discontinuous VCR functions, it is less expensive than a set-top box that uses buffering to provide continuous VCR functions as discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Performance Evaluation 4.1 System Parameters In order to understand the performance of our proposed Video-On-Demand system, we developed a simulation. The simulated Video-On-Demand system is parameterized by the following: 1. Number of Customers Making Requests. <p> Limiting the functions of this system allows us to better compare the three systems. 2. Multicast Communication with Continuous Pause. This is a multicast system that provides continuous pause, but at the expense of having a buffer in the set-top box (This system is discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>). 3. Multicast Communication with Discontinuous Pause. This is the system discussed in this paper. However, we only allow discontinuous pause so that we can compare the performance to the other two systems.

Reference-contexts: Previous work has addressed the provision of such systems through the use of multicast communication (or batching) in which multiple customers with similar requests are serviced simultaneously <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. In previous work by the authors of this paper [2], we have considered a system that uses multicast communication to deliver video streams to multiple customers. <p> The multicast system allows the customers to issue pause requests which are accommodated through the combined use of set-top box buffering and multicast stream switching. In <ref> [3] </ref>, batching of requests is used and policies for selecting which movies to serve are evaluated. In that system customers that wait too long may renege and one of the objectives in choosing a scheduling policy is to minimize the effect of reneging. <p> A blocked VCR action simply means that the action does not occur, and playout of the movie continues. Alternatively, the customer can be queued for service at a later time. We do not consider this latter option which has been analyzed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.3 Video Server Operation The video server has three functions. The first function is to determine whether or not a customer request for a movie can be satisfied. <p> Note that the video server performs straight-forward First Come, First Serve scheduling. That is, no request is denied if a channel is available (free or assigned to the same movie) at the requested time. Other scheduling disciplines are possible, and some have been investigated in <ref> [3] </ref>. The second function is to process requests to change multicast groups. A request is received at the video server when a customer uses a VCR action.

Reference-contexts: Interactive VOD allows customers to use VCR-style functions such as pause, rewind and fast-forward. The major challenge in providing a VOD service is handling the enormous demand for VHS-quality video in a real-time network with real-time interaction <ref> [4] </ref>. In most proposed architectures for VOD systems, the preferred approach is to service customers individually by allocating and dedicating a transmission channel and a set of video server resources to each customer. The problem with this approach is that it leads to an expensive-to-operate, non-scalable system.

Reference-contexts: The video server is a control point for processing and forwarding movie frames. The issues involved in retrieving and sending video frames have been the subject of some recent research (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>). 2. The Network: The functions of the network are to transmit video frames from the video server to the customer, and to transmit control messages. The topology that we are using is a star-bus configuration with the video server at the center of the star.

Reference-contexts: Of course, long slots detract from the "on-demand" nature of the system. The other factor is the popularity of a particular movie. The system is more likely to be able to group requests for currently popular movies than for a less frequently requested movie. Experience and Zipf <ref> [9] </ref> suggest that a small percentage of the movie offerings will experience the largest request volume. It is for these movies that the benefit of the use of multicast becomes apparent. 4 3.2 Providing VCR Capability Once the movie starts, the customer can pause, rewind, or fast forward, the movie. <p> A request is equally likely to be for any slot. 9.
