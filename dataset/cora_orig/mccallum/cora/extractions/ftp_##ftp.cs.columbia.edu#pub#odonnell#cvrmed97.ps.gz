Abstract: We introduce a novel analytic model formulation for recovering cylindrical structures (e.g., blood vessels) from segmented 3-D medical image data. Unlike all previous formulations, our model is capable of describing a cylinder with an arbitrary spine (a space curve based on cubic B-splines) and arbitrary cross section which is guaranteed to be orthogonal to the spine. Given this expressiveness, we are able to provide a second order continuous approximation to the centerline of nearly any tubular object. This information may be used for such tasks as a reformatting of the original image data in order to visually detect stenoses or aneurysms. In addition, the cross-section parameter values of our model may aid in automatically isolating these regions. We maintain a relatively simple cross-section function to make this detection straightforward (note that any cross-section function is possible). To describe fine detail in the data, we employ local finite element deformations from the model surface. Thus we are able to recover gross geometric approximations as well as quantify characteristics of the object such as its surface area. We apply our model to the recovery of both a healthy and diseased aorta from segmented CT acquisitions.

Finally, we will draw conclusions on our work and present future directions. 2 Related Work Stockman and Huang <ref> [3] </ref> introduced a form of general axis GC they dubbed the "the tube description." The model sets up an object-centered coordinate frame with a cross-section function free to rotate with respect to it.

Reference-contexts: A discontinuity in the cylinder based on the Frenet-Serret description due to an inflection point. arbitrary point. In addition, their cross-section functions are not guaranteed to be orthogonal to the model's spine. Finally, the EGC model proposed by O'Donnell et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>, has a cross-section function orthogonal to the spine but the form the spine may take is quite limited. The spine must be expressible as a set of functions on an arbitrary axis in space. Loops, for example, are beyond its range.

Local displacements, S i (t; ), away from the model surface are interpolated via FEM shape functions based on the model's triangular element tessellation. <p> In order to insure a smoothness of fit, this mesh-like component is endowed with a stretching penalty which penalizes sharp edges and insures that these local deformations do not describe features expressible by the base model. 4 Experimental Results Recovery was performed using the physically-motivated approach of Metaxas and Terzopoulos <ref> [7] </ref>. All data was segmented via a 2-D dynamic programming method [2]. Figure 6 shows the final fit of the model to segmented healthy human aortic arch data taken from dense spiral CTA acquisition.

Reference-contexts: The local coordinate frame rotates around the spine in the presence of torsion. Thus, small changes in the underlying spine can cause large changes in the shape of a cylinder with a non-circular cross section.

Reference-contexts: The tube model is elegant and flexible, but the cross-section function is not kept orthogonal or even at a constant angle with respect to the spine. A more common cylinder representation is based on the Frenet-Serret formulae <ref> [9] </ref>. The moving trihedron formed by the tangent, normal and binormal vectors defined by these formulae may serve as the foundation for a cross-section along a space curve. In contrast to the tube description, Frenet-Serret based models are guaranteed to have their cross-sections orthogonal to the spine.
