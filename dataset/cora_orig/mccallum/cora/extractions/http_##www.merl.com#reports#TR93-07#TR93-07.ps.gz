Abstract: The asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is expected to be the multiplexing and switching technique for future broadband integrated service digital networks (BISDNs) which can transport almost all types of traffic including bursty data traffic and continuous voice/video frames. However, this capability cannot be realized without a proper congestion-control scheme. This paper discusses the suitability of the real-time channel approach [1] for congestion control in ATM networks. A new message-transmission scheme is proposed which is suitable for ATM networks and has a number of advantages over existing schemes. The achievable quality of service with this scheme would make ATM networks capable of supporting real-time services which have been promised but not yet successfully realized.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth enforcement monitors individual connections to ensure that the actual traffic flow conforms to that specified at the time of connection establishment. Considerable attention has been paid to the issue of congestion control in packet-switched high-speed networks <ref> [5, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 10, 11] </ref>. The congestion-control strategies proposed in [5, 1, 8, 9] aim at providing the transmission-delay bounds for applications, such as video and audio transmissions, that have stringent timing requirements in face of other types of data traffic. <p> Considerable attention has been paid to the issue of congestion control in packet-switched high-speed networks [5, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 10, 11].

To alleviate this problem, we propose a congestion-control scheme based on the concept of real-time channel <ref> [1] </ref>. With this scheme, a network guarantees the timely transmission of real-time messages and handles non real-time messages on a best-effort basis. Another advantage of the scheme is that it integrates admission control and bandwidth enforcement so as to eliminate the need of a separate mechanism for bandwidth enforcement. <p> Moreover, with the proposed scheme, messages need not carry any timing information, either in the form of timestamps or deadlines. Although the schemes proposed in <ref> [1, 9, 12] </ref> also support real-time channels, it is different from the one described in this paper.

Two protocols are needed to implement the above two techniques: a channel establishment protocol and a message transmission protocol <ref> [12, 14] </ref>. The channel establishment protocol handles requests for establishing real-time channels.

Both of them are connection-oriented to provide a proper quality of service and use statistical packet multiplexing to achieve high transmission efficiency. <p> Suppose a real-time channel with a maximum message size M runs through n links with guaranteed worst-case link delays d 1 ; ; d n , respectively. Then, the end-to-end message-delivery delay bound can be calculated as <ref> [12, 14] </ref>, D = k=1 6 With the above equation, the end-to-end message-delay bound D for a real-time channel can be guaranteed with one of the following methods. M1: Divide the end-to-end delay bound D into link delay bounds d k 's such that Eq. (1) is satisfied. <p> Given a new channel t n with the minimum message inter-arrival time T n and the maximum message size M n , what is the minimum value of d n such that all n channels are still schedulable over the link? The deadline scheduling theory developed in <ref> [15, 12] </ref> solves the above two problems if the messages of all real-time channels abide by their pre-specified traffic generation pattern (i.e., the message inter-arrival time is not smaller than T and the message size is not larger than M ). <p> According to Protocol 3.2 and the actual cell-arrival times, the logical cell-arrival times are shown at the bottom of the figure. The deadline of a cell is calculated as the cell logical arrival time plus the assigned link-delay bound. Comparing with the message-transmission protocols proposed in <ref> [12, 14] </ref>, Protocols 3.1 and 3.2 have the following advantages: 1. Cells need not carry the deadline information in their headers. <p> Cells need not carry the deadline information in their headers. With Protocol 3.2, the deadline of a cell is calculated from the logical arrival time of the current message and the arrival time of the cell, while the protocols of <ref> [12, 14] </ref> require the information of the cell deadline at the previous node. This feature is especially useful for ATM networks since the short, standardized ATM cell header does not have room to hold the cell-deadline information. 2. <p> This feature is especially useful for ATM networks since the short, standardized ATM cell header does not have room to hold the cell-deadline information. 2.

Both of them are connection-oriented to provide a proper quality of service and use statistical packet multiplexing to achieve high transmission efficiency. <p> In other words, the deadline scheduling reduces the probability of unnecessarily rejecting connection setup requests. 2. Available admission-control schemes: A rich deadline scheduling theory has been established from which the admission-control schemes for real-time channels can be derived <ref> [15, 14] </ref>. This theory can be used directly for ATM networks from which the guaranteed quality of service can be provided if the deadline scheduling of cell transmissions is implemented in ATM switches. 3. <p> In such a case it is meaningless to use deadline scheduling at a transmission link. To solve this problem, a hardware implementation of the deadline scheduler was proposed in <ref> [17, 14] </ref> which can schedule an incoming cell in at most 12 clock cycles. <p> Suppose a real-time channel with a maximum message size M runs through n links with guaranteed worst-case link delays d 1 ; ; d n , respectively.

This simplifies the switch design. Protocols of <ref> [12, 14] </ref> require a switch to run a different protocol for real-time packets originating from a node to which the switch is directly connected. 9 Another important problem which must be addressed to implement real-time channels is buffer management in ATM switches.

Reference-contexts: The message transmission protocol implements the deadline scheduling of message transmissions. It specifies how a message is divided into packets, and how deadlines of a packet over the links it traverses are calculated. Readers are referred to <ref> [14, 15, 12] </ref> for more details. 3 Real-time Communication in ATM Networks ATM bears many similarities to real-time channels. Both of them are connection-oriented to provide a proper quality of service and use statistical packet multiplexing to achieve high transmission efficiency. <p> In other words, the deadline scheduling reduces the probability of unnecessarily rejecting connection setup requests. 2. Available admission-control schemes: A rich deadline scheduling theory has been established from which the admission-control schemes for real-time channels can be derived <ref> [15, 14] </ref>. This theory can be used directly for ATM networks from which the guaranteed quality of service can be provided if the deadline scheduling of cell transmissions is implemented in ATM switches. 3. <p> Given a new channel t n with the minimum message inter-arrival time T n and the maximum message size M n , what is the minimum value of d n such that all n channels are still schedulable over the link? The deadline scheduling theory developed in <ref> [15, 12] </ref> solves the above two problems if the messages of all real-time channels abide by their pre-specified traffic generation pattern (i.e., the message inter-arrival time is not smaller than T and the message size is not larger than M ).

Reference-contexts: of queueing delays: The deadline scheduling policy can minimize the effects of queueing delays in the sense that given a set of cells with deadlines, if they are schedulable under any scheduling policy (i.e., every cell can be transmitted before its deadline), so can they under the deadline scheduling policy <ref> [16] </ref>. Thus, the deadline scheduling policy gives a communication network more capacity to accommodate real-time traffic than that with other scheduling policies. In other words, the deadline scheduling reduces the probability of unnecessarily rejecting connection setup requests. 2.

Reference-contexts: In such a case it is meaningless to use deadline scheduling at a transmission link. To solve this problem, a hardware implementation of the deadline scheduler was proposed in <ref> [17, 14] </ref> which can schedule an incoming cell in at most 12 clock cycles.
