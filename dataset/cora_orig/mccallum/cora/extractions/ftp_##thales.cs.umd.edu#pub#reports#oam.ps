Abstract: The adjugate A A of a matrix A is the transpose of the matrix of the cofactors of the elements of A. The computation of the adjugate from its definition involves the computation of n 2 determinants of order (n 1) | a prohibitively expensive O(n 4 ) process. On the other hand, the computation from the formula A A = det(A)A 1 breaks down when A is singular and is potentially unstable when A is ill-conditioned with respect to inversion. In this paper we first show that the adjugate can be perfectly conditioned, even when A is ill-conditioned. We then show that if due care is taken the adjugate can be accurately computed from the inverse, even when the latter has been inaccurately computed. In an appendix to this paper we give a formal derivation of an observation of Wilkinson on the accuracy of computed inverses. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports or on the web at http://www.cs.umd.edu/ stewart/. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Mary-land, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: Before turning to specific XDY factorizations, an observation on singular matrices is in order. Mathematically, a singular matrix must result in a matrix D in which at 3 Objects other than adjugates can be accurately computed from a suitable XDY decomposition | e.g., the singular values of a matrix <ref> [2] </ref>. 8 On the Adjugate Matrix least one diagonal element is zero | in which case the algorithm cannot proceed. In the presence of rounding error this eventuality is unlikely. If, however, D does have a zero diagonal element, the cure is to perturb it slightly and proceed.

Wilkinson gave an informal analysis based on the fact that triangular systems are generally solved accurately.
