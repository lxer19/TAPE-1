Abstract: Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surfaces demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that the approximation presented above obeys Helmholtz's reciprocity principle (see <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> ). Also note that the above model reduces to the Lam-bertian model when = 0. Note that by substituting the albedo as function of the wavelength, (), the dependency of the model on the wavelength comes out explicitly.

Reference-contexts: This reduction in brightness can be derived using geometry and incorporated into a single term, called the geometrical attenuation factor (GAF ), that lies between zero and unity. Several derivations of the GAF have been presented [ 30 ] <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> [ 23 ] .

Reference-contexts: Some of the models are empirical such as Opik's model [ 22 ] and its modification by Minnaert [ 19 ] .

Smith modeled the rough surface as a random process and assumed each point on the surface to be Lambertian in reflectance. <p> Smith's analysis, however, was confined to the plane of incidence and is not easily extensible to reflections outside this plane. Moreover, Smith's model does not account for interreflection effects. Buhl et al. <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> modeled the surface as a collection of spherical cavities. They analyzed interreflections using this surface model, but did not present a complete model that accounts for masking and shadowing effects for arbitrary angles of reflection and incidence.

In the past decade, computer graphics has witnessed the application of several physically-based reflectance models for image rendering (see [ 7 ] , [ 16 ] , <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> , [ 13 ] ).

We show that the primary cause for this deviation is the roughness of the surface. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between magnification and reflectance (also see <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> ). The reflecting surface may be viewed as a collection of planar facets. At high magnification, each picture element (rendered pixel) includes a single facet. At lower magnifications, each pixel can include a large number of facets. <p> Other researchers in graphics have numerically pre-computed fairly complex reflectance functions and stored the results in the form of look-up tables or coefficients of spherical harmonic expansion (for examples, see [ 4 ] <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> [ 33 ] ). This approach, though practical in many instances, does not replace the need for accurate analytical reflectance models. The reflectance model developed here can be applied to isotropic as well as anisotropic rough surfaces, and can handle arbitrary source and viewer directions.

Reference-contexts: We begin by modeling the surface as a collection of long symmetric V-cavities. Each V-cavity has two opposing facets and each facet is assumed to be much larger than the wavelength of incident light. This surface model was used by Torrance and Sparrow <ref> [ 30 ] </ref> to describe incoherent directional component of surface reflection from rough surfaces. Here, we assume the facets to be Lambertian 2 . <p> To accomplish this, we use the roughness model proposed by Torrance and Sparrow <ref> [ 30 ] </ref> that assumes the surface to be composed of long symmetric V-cavities (see width of each facet is assumed to be small compared to its length. <p> Both these geometrical phenomena reduce the projected radiance of the facet. This reduction in brightness can be derived using geometry and incorporated into a single term, called the geometrical attenuation factor (GAF ), that lies between zero and unity. Several derivations of the GAF have been presented <ref> [ 30 ] </ref> [ 2 ] [ 23 ] . <p> Figures 10 and 11 show results for a sample C (foam) and sample D (cloth) that has not only a body reflectance component but also a significant surface reflection component.

Reference-contexts: In both cases, a small peak is noticed near the source direction. This phenomenon is known as the opposition effect or retroreflection. It is a sharp peak close to the source direction and is caused by a different backscattering mechanism from the one described by our model. (see <ref> [ 12, 17, 31, 21, 27, 11 ] </ref> ). Figures 10 and 11 show results for a sample C (foam) and sample D (cloth) that has not only a body reflectance component but also a significant surface reflection component.

Reference-contexts: The experiments were conducted on real samples such as sand, plaster, and cloth. In all cases, reflectance predicted by the model was found to be in strong agreement with measurements. The derived model has been implemented as a shading function in Ren-derMan <ref> [ 32 ] </ref> . We conclude by comparing real and rendered images of a variety of objects. <p> The functional approximation, given by equation (14), and the qualitative model, given by (17), are easily used for realistic rendering. We have implemented the functional approximation as a "shader" using the RenderMan shading language <ref> [ 32 ] </ref> . Figure 14 shows spheres rendered using the shader. In all four cases, the sphere is illuminated from the viewer direction. In the first case, = 0, and hence the sphere appears Lambertian. As the roughness increases, the sphere begins to appear flatter.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers in graphics have numerically pre-computed fairly complex reflectance functions and stored the results in the form of look-up tables or coefficients of spherical harmonic expansion (for examples, see [ 4 ] [ 16 ] <ref> [ 33 ] </ref> ). This approach, though practical in many instances, does not replace the need for accurate analytical reflectance models. The reflectance model developed here can be applied to isotropic as well as anisotropic rough surfaces, and can handle arbitrary source and viewer directions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An active area of research in computer graphics involves the creation of realistic images. Images are rendered using one of two well-known techniques, namely, ray tracing <ref> [ 34 ] </ref> or radiosity [ 6 ] . The quality of a rendered image depends to a great extent on the accuracy of the reflectance model used.
