Abstract: Replication is a commonly proposed solution to problems of scale associated with distributed services. However, when a service is replicated, each client must be assigned a server. Prior work has generally assumed that assignment to be static. In contrast, we propose dynamic server selection, and show that it enables application-level congestion avoidance. To make dynamic server selection practical, we demonstrate the use of three tools. In addition to direct measurements of round-trip latency, we introduce and validate two new tools: bprobe, which estimates the maximum possible bandwidth along a given path; and cprobe, which estimates the current congestion along a path. Using these tools we demonstrate dynamic server selection and compare it to previous static approaches. We show that dynamic server selection consistently outperforms static policies by as much as 50%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of each of our tools in performing dynamic server selection.

Reference-contexts: As previously stated, our dynamic policy operates under the assumption of widespread replication of documents (such as proposed in <ref> [1, 7] </ref>). We further assume that it is possible for a client to obtain a list of hosts serving replicas of the document of interest (perhaps by contacting the home server of a document).

Reference-contexts: From earlier work <ref> [2] </ref> we have available a database of document size and location information. From this source we extracted sets of documents of sizes 100KB, 500KB, 750KB and 1MB. We chose these larger sizes because the transfer times of these large documents should be influenced by available bandwidth as well as latency.

In such a network, a path between any two hosts in the network is made up of one or more links.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, clients may know in advance which service providers are best for them. Such a static server selection scheme is used, e.g., in the distribution of network news using NNTP. However, static server selection is inappropriate in a number of cases. For example: 1) The authors in <ref> [6] </ref> employ a dynamic protocol to find the best server for a document: the client probes a set of servers who may have a replica of the document, as well as the document's home server, and chooses the first to reply as the source of the document. 2) A mobile client <p> Furthermore, as we will show, the quickly changing and highly variable conditions in the Internet require a degree of dynamic assessment that static policies do not provide. A dynamic server selection policy based on measured latency was used to choose among hierarchically organized caches in Harvest <ref> [6] </ref>. The cache's resolution protocol performs a remote procedure call to all of the siblings and parents of the cache and checks for hits. The cache then retrieves the object from the responding site with the smallest measured latency.

Reference-contexts: This method also relies on the server maintaining a large amount of geographical information. In contrast, we show below that a dynamic server selection policy can provide high performance and allows simplification of the placement policy. Guyton and Schwartz also focus on distance measures in <ref> [8] </ref> with the objective of keeping communication local and limiting the use of long-haul links. Since they seek to avoid high-speed links, their approach does not give preference to minimizing round-trip times. They find that the high variability of round-trip times renders them unattractive in practice.

Reference-contexts: Then we move on to describe experiments that combine these two probe methods with RTT measurements in the context of the server selection problem. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing and future work. 1.1 Related Work In <ref> [9] </ref>, Gwertzman and Seltzer propose a replication technique (and presumed server assignment) based on geographical distance in which servers are responsible for placing replicas near sources of high demand. <p> However, the difference between the characteristics of hops and latencies is fundamental enough to also suggest differences in algorithms for server replication. An initial replica placement policy might try to place replicas "close" to the clients that will use them (e.g., <ref> [9] </ref>). This follows naturally when thinking about hops as the distance metric. Because the bulk of the hops distribution is centered about the mean, care is required in placing replicas if the goal is to minimize the number of hops between client and server.
