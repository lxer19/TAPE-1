Abstract: Techniques are proposed for the routing of very high-frequency circuits. In this approach, performance sensitivities are used to derive a set of bounds on critical parasitics and to generate weights for a cost function which drives an area router. In addition to these bounds, design often requires that the length of interconnect lines be equal to predefined values. The routing scheme enforces both types of constraints in two phases. During the first phase all parasitic constraints are enforced on all nets. Equality constraints are enforced during the second phase by expanding each net simultaneously while ensuring that no additional violations to parasitic constraints are introduced in the layout. During both phases accurate and efficient parasitic estimations are guaranteed by compact analytical models, based on 2-D and 3-D field analysis. Finally, a global check on all distributed parasitics is performed. If the original constraints are not satisfied, the weights are updated based on severity of the violation and routing is applied iteratively. Several layouts synthesized using this technique have been fabricated and successfully tested, confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

Reference-contexts: However, due to the lack of an explicit reference to performance, the synthesis process could result in a large number of time-consuming iterations necessary to satisfy specifications. Other semi-automated topology-driven approaches to the routing of MMICs have also been proposed <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. These systems include template-based routines for the abutment of pre-defined cells implementing devices as well as interconnect. The knowledge of the relative position of all cells provides the starting point of the layout realization, thus strongly limiting the flexibility of the approach and its applicability to complex designs. <p> To insure that all relevant parasitics are considered during the optimization, each interconnect line to be implemented in the circuit is modeled as a microstrip line with inductive and capacitive coupling with all the other nets. A numerical sensitivity analysis is performed for each performance function using simulator MNS <ref> [4] </ref>. All parasitics, whose cumulative contribution to performance degradation is negligible, are automatically discarded. Bounds on critical distributed parasitics are calculated by using constrained optimization, the objective being the maximization of the flexibility of the layout generation process.

A summary of the formulae used in our approach for estimating Z o and ff can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. The constraint generation techniques outlined in [10] and [11] need be modified to account for the distributed nature of parasitics in microwave circuits. <p> Parasitics such as cross-couplings, characteristic impedance degradation, losses and microstrip line length tolerances are constrained in this fashion. Constraints on parasitics related to short and open microtrip terminations are derived from the above constraints as described in <ref> [9] </ref>. Assuming that performance is linear near its nominal value at all frequencies, it can be represented as a linear combination of its sensitivity with respect to all distributed parasitics at all frequencies. <p> Parasitics involving the detailed realization of interconnect such as bends, gaps and steps need be considered in a somewhat different way. A bended interconnect realization is shown in Figure 3, where the bends have been replaced with appropriate models <ref> [9] </ref>. Consider the problem of finding a constraint on the number of bends in the microstrip line. Suppose a microstrip line of nominal length L is partitioned into N segments of length L=N each. Let us model N 1 bends as in Figure 3. <p> This technique can also be used for implementing stubs simply by creating a virtual target in an area where no parasitic violations can occur <ref> [9] </ref>. The routing order of the nets is determined automatically giving priority to the wiring of stubs and of nets on which parasitic constraints are tightest. This is done to not compromise the ability of the router to meet all parasitic constraints by routing first non-critical nets. <p> freq. range (GHz) 25-30 30-35 35-40 40-43 jS 11 j (dB) -0.15 -0.03 -0.54 -0.12 jS 21 j (dB) +0.54 +1.21 +1.57 +0.53 Table 3: Worst-case performance degradation form nominal of pcn38. summary of the models, along with the CPU time required for their generation on a DECstation 5000/240 (See <ref> [9] </ref> for a detailed description of the models).
