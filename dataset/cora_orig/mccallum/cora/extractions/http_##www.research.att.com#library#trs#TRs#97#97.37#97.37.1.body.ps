Abstract: Existing software proposals for electronic payments can be divided into on-line schemes that require participation of a trusted party (the bank) in every transaction and are secure against overspending, and the off-line schemes that do not require a third party and guarantee only that overspending is detected when vendors submit their transaction records to the bank (usually at the end of the day). We propose a new hybrid scheme that combines the advantages of both of the above traditional design strategies. It allows for control of overspending at a cost of only a modest increase in communication compared to the off-line schemes. Our protocol is based on probabilistic polling. During each transaction, with some small probability, the vendor forwards information about this transaction to the bank. This enables the bank to maintain an accurate approximation of a customer's spending. The frequency of polling messages is related to the monetary value of transactions and the amount of overspending the bank is willing to risk.

Reference-contexts: However, that is precisely what is not acceptable in micropay-ments, since the computational and communication requirements this imposes are excessive when a purchase costs a fraction of a penny. Therefore, many micropayment schemes have been proposed (Millicent [GMA + 95], PayWord [RS96], NetCard <ref> [AMS96] </ref>, Pedersen's proposal [Ped96], and PayTree [JY96]) which are off-line. In all these systems, to make purchases from vendors, a customer must receive a digital certificate from a bank or some other financial intermediary. <p> in Pedersen's scheme, P (1) contains a unit worth (in dollars) of future payments from U to V , and a value x n = h n (x 0 ) which is a result of n applications of publicly known hash function h to a random value x 0 (see <ref> [RS96, AMS96, Ped96] </ref> for details). In PayTree, P (1) contains a root of a tree of hash applications to random leaf values (see [JY96]). The future payment schemes might do it in yet another way.

Reference-contexts: Previous Micropayment Schemes Software-only electronic payment systems (which are the only ones we will discuss from now on) can be secure if they are fully on-line, so that the issuer participates in each transaction (as in iKP <ref> [BGH + 95] </ref> or NetCheque [NM95]). However, that is precisely what is not acceptable in micropay-ments, since the computational and communication requirements this imposes are excessive when a purchase costs a fraction of a penny.
