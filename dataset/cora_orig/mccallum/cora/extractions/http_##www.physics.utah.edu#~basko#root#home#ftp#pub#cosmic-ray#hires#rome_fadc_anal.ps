Abstract: Figure 3: Pulse Area Resolution. Each point represents the pulse area resolution for a single phototube for a set of fixed geometry laser shots. The circles are FADC and the plusses are S/H. The solid curve is the expectation for FADC from photo-electron statistics. The dotted curve is the expectation for S/H. The FADC system provides a unique opportunity to study EAS events in conjunction with CASA/MIA detectors. Comparison of coincident events will allow the underlying assumptions used in the different analyses to be tested and evaluated. Work is in progress to finalize the analysis techniques that will be used on the FADC data.
