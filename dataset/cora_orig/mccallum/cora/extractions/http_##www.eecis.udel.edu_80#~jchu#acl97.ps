Abstract: In this paper, we argue for the need to distinguish between task and dialogue initiatives, and present a model for tracking shifts in both types of initiatives in dialogue interactions. Our model predicts the initiative holders in the next dialogue turn based on the current initiative holders and the effect that observed cues have on changing them. Our evaluation across various corpora shows that the use of cues consistently improves the accuracy in the system's prediction of task and dialogue initiative holders by 2-4 and 8-13 percentage points, respectively, thus illustrating the generality of our model.

Reference-contexts: In this experiment, K is 0.57 for the task initiative holder agreement and K is 0.69 for the dialogue initiative holder agreement. Carletta suggests that content analysis researchers consider K &gt;.8 as good reliability, with .67&lt; K &lt;.8 allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn <ref> (Carletta, 1996) </ref>. Strictly based on this metric, our results indicate that the three coders have a reasonable level of agreement with respect to the dialogue initiative holders, but do not have reliable agreement with respect to the task initiative holders.

Reference-contexts: To test the statistical significance of the differences between the results obtained by the two prediction algorithms, for each corpus, we applied Cochran's Q test <ref> (Cochran, 1950) </ref> to the results in rows 2 and 3. The tests show that for all corpora, the differences between the two algorithms when predicting the task and dialogue initiative holders are statistically significant at the levels of p&lt;0.05 and p&lt; 10 5 , respectively.

Reference-contexts: We then evaluated the system on subsets of dialogues from four other corpora: the TRAINS93 dialogues <ref> (Heeman and Allen, 1995) </ref>, airline reservation dialogues (SRI Transcripts, 1992), instruction-giving dialogues (Map Task Dialogues, 1996), and non-task-oriented dialogues (Switchboard Credit Card Corpus, 1992). In addition, we applied our baseline strategy which makes predictions without the use of cues to each corpus.

Reference-contexts: The second type includes utterances that do not contribute information that has not been conveyed earlier in the dialogue. It can be further classified into two groups: repetitions, a subset of the informationally redundant utterances <ref> (Walker, 1992) </ref>, in which the speaker paraphrases an utterance by the hearer or repeats the utterance verbatim, and prompts, in which the speaker merely acknowledges the hearer's previous utterance (s).

Reference-contexts: You should take distributed programming to satisfy your requirement, and sign up as a listener for NLP. Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of <ref> (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) </ref>. In utterance (3a), A directly responds to S's question; thus the conversational lead remains with S. On the other hand, in (3b) and (3c), A takes the lead by initiating a subdialogue to correct S's invalid proposal. <p> Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative <ref> (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) </ref>. The third type includes questions which, based on anticipated responses, are divided into domain and evaluation questions. Domain questions are questions in which the speaker intends to obtain or verify a piece of domain knowledge.
