Reference-contexts: The final index requires approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the UKERNA, Deliverable 1 UCL-JEDI Final 22 memory space of the original data. In addition temporary space equal to twice that is required during indexing. 8.3 WWW and HTML A specific advantage of C-WAIS is that it allows WWW <ref> [3] </ref> access to the data via WAISGATE. We have installed WAISGATE with the HTTP server; using WAISGATE allows access via WWW - provided the user passes strong authentication. WAISGATE provides a means for a WWW clients - Mosaic [30] I, Netscape [32] to communicate with WAIS Servers.

Reference-contexts: There are many word processing packages that can read and write RTF format files (e.g MicroSoft Word <ref> [4] </ref>, WordPerfect [5] and Frame Maker [33]...). RTF2HTML is designed to translate existing RTF documents to HTML documents. Using the SGML-&gt;ODA converter described above, an SGML document can be converted to an ODA document. Then the document can be viewed using the SLATE and the WORD for Windows editor.

Reference-contexts: The C-WAIS distribution tapes contain the binaries for indexer, server and Custom Parser Toolkit (CPT). Components of the C-WAIS are described below: waisserver is a program that services WAIS clients using the Z39.50 <ref> [9] </ref> and TCP protocols. For each new client that contacts the server, the server forks off a child server process to handle that client's requests. <p> WAISGATE provides a means for a WWW clients - Mosaic [30] I, Netscape [32] to communicate with WAIS Servers. WAISGATE runs on a server machine running an HTTP daemon; it provides access to local and remote WAIS databases using the Z39.50 Information Retrieval Protocol. <ref> [9] </ref> Figure 2 shows interaction of a WWW client and WAISserver Features of WAISGATE include: Ability to access local and remote WAIS databases. Multi-type documents with associated icons for each document format.

Reference-contexts: The document is translated to a HTML document using CoST and the UCL specification for mapping the SGML instances to HTML. Using the WWW client such as Mosaic [30] or Netscape [32] the document is then viewed. Using the WAIS Parser <ref> [10] </ref> the documents is added to UCL-JEDI database, Using the WAISGATE searching facility (see section 8.3), the database can be searched and the relevant document displayed. 7.3 SGML-&gt;ODA-&gt;RTF-&gt;HTML RTF is a document formatting language developed by MicroSoft [7]. <p> The list of relevant documents are then encoded in the protocol, and transmitted back to the client. The client decodes the response, and displays the results. The documents can then be retrieved from the server. 8.2 Commercial WAIS We have acquired the commercial version of WAIS (C-WAIS) <ref> [10] </ref>, in its (alleged) multiprocessor version. We say "alleged", because our current release allows parallel processing of different databases; it does not allow multiple processors to operate on the same database.

Reference-contexts: Most of the current WWW solution is based on HTML 2.0 [31]; a small selection of documents are available in HTML 3.0 <ref> [17] </ref> which extends HTML 2.0 to support tables, text flow around figures and mathematics. Typically, an author will write material using whatever word-processor they are used to, and then use a filter to translate the output into HTML or they can use any HTML editors to create an HTML document.

The Package is based on the DAPS FOD26 and defines some limitations and fallbacks which are described in the "Introduction Manuals".

Reference-contexts: The format of the typesetting tapes is not SGML, but is a proprietary scheme encoded in an IBM database format. This is converted into SGML by Bellcore as part of the CORE <ref> [26] </ref> project. They pass the SGML versions of the documents on to us (along with the scanned image components), with the permission of the ACS. This is in a special DTD used only for this data, but based on the AAP DTD. we name it ACS-DTD.

UKERNA, Deliverable 1 UCL-JEDI Final 20 7.2 SGML-&gt;HTML CoST (Copenhagen SGML Tool) <ref> [27] </ref> is a structure-controlled SGML application programming tool. It is built on top of a public domain SGML tool. Using CoST we can write translation specifications for SGML document instances. CoST is purely structure driven, i.e. it gives an access to the structure of the SGML document instance.
