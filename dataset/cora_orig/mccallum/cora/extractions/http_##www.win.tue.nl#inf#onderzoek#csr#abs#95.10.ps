Reference-contexts: Computer support for mathematical work has a long tradition and takes various forms | including algebraic manipulation systems like Maple and Mathematica, theorem provers like that designed and implemented by Boyer and Moore <ref> [1] </ref> and proof assistants like mural [4]. Typically, the goal of such systems is to improve the reliability of mathematical calculation.

Reference-contexts: Each stencil consists of a number of templates, each of which may have various versions. In order to illustrate the use of stencils we have extracted various notational elements from the book "A Logical Approach to Discrete Math" by David Gries and Fred B. Schnei-der <ref> [3] </ref>. and incorporated them in the stencil "Gries-Schneider". This stencil, as it appears on the screen is shown in fig. 1. Like all authors, Gries and Schneider have their own style for presenting definitions, theorems etc., and their own notational conventions for constructing mathematical expressions.

Typically, the goal of such systems is to improve the reliability of mathematical calculation. In the area of program development systems (of which mural and the Boyer-Moore theorem prover are examples) the emphasis has traditionally been on the use of the computer as verifier.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A is a system for preparing documents (books, articles etc.) on a computer. The main strength of the system lies in the preparation of documents of a mathematical nature, particularly in the case that the mathematics is non-standard. It builds upon the flexibility of the T E X <ref> [5] </ref> and L A T E X document-preparation systems [6] by providing a mechanism for converting documents prepared with the aid of the system into L A T E X documents.
