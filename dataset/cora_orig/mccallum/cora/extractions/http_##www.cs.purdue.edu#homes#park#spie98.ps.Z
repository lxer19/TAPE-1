Abstract: This paper studies the ordering properties of quality of service (QoS) measures and their rendered values in multi-class QoS provision systems when generalized processor sharing (GPS)-based packet scheduling is employed at routers. GPS has been proposed as a building block for providing multiple service classes with differentiated services to applications with diverse QoS requirements. Previous works have concentrated on finding algorithms and implementations that faithfully approximate the fairness properties of GPS with some work done on deriving performance bounds when leaky-bucket traffic shaping is applied at traffic sources. In this paper, we study the problem of facilitating effective quality of service in multi-class systems with multidimensional QoS vectors containing both mean- and burstiness-related QoS indicators such as packet loss rate, delay, and jitter. We study the impact of traffic burstiness and network contention on the properties of rendered QoS in the service classes. We show that under bursty traffic conditions, it is intrinsically difficult for one service class to deliver quality of service superior in both mean- and burstiness-related QoS measures|delay and jitter|over another when GPS scheduling is employed at routers. In particular, to achieve lower mean packet loss and packet loss variance, higher delay variance (i.e., jitter) must be incurred. Conversely, the price for achieving lower mean delay and delay variance is higher packet loss variance. This result is applicable to both reserved and best-effort traffic classes and affects the "programming" of GPS routers for QoS provision by constraining what application QoS requirements can be effectively met. We show performance results in a specific GPS-based QoS provision platform|noncooperative multi-class QoS provision|which demonstrate the impact of the ordering results on providing effective quality of service to applications with diverse QoS requirements.

Reference-contexts: The service rate of the system is given by and we will assume that the switch implements a form of GPS with service weights ff 1 ; ff 2 ; : : : ; ff m where ff j 0, j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and P m j=1 ff j = 1. Here, m denotes the number of service classes. The total service rate is split between the two traffic classes = R + NR . <p> the GPS switch? In particular, if x 1 ; x 2 2 R s , s 1, denote QoS vectors depicting rendered (or achieved ) QoS at the router, does ff 1 &gt; ff 2 imply x 1 &lt; x 2 ? Let fi = f i : i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> g, i = ( i 2 ; : : : ; i s ) T , denote the set of QoS requirements for a population of n applications. <p> Given that the QoS rendered by a service class j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> is an induced phenomenon depending on the total traffic influx q j to class j, the question arises how well the induced QoS levels match the needs of the constituent application QoS requirements. <p> As part of the general problem, we are interested in answering a very basic but fundamental question: If fi is totally ordered, can QoS be rendered at the m service classes such that the performance QoS vector set X = f x j : j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> g, x j = (x j j s ) T , is also linearly ordered? To maintain comparability, we will assume that the n input processes are i.i.d. <p> We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. Let ij 0, i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, j 2 [1; m], denote the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Thus, i = P m That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. <p> We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. Let ij 0, i 2 [1; n], j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, denote the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Thus, i = P m That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. <p> We also consider the special case when traffic assignments are restricted to be "all in one bag," i.e., ij 2 f i ; 0g, for all j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Let fl = ( ij : i; j) denote the resource assignment matrix, and let c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c m be the packet loss rates of the m service classes. <p> Each packet loss rate is a function of fl, c j = c j (fl); j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>: Assuming isolatedness, we have c j = c j (q j ) where q j = P n i=1 ij is the total traffic volume assigned to class j. <p> That is, L i (fl) is the set of all unilateral strategies for player i. An assignment fl fl is a Nash equilibrium if 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, 8fl 2 L i (fl fl ), U i (fl) U i (fl fl ): That is, in a Nash equilibrium, player i cannot improve its individual utility U i by unilaterally changing its strategy. <p> We associate prices p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p m with the service classes, and applications incur a cost of ij p j for sending a traffic volume of ij tagged by service class identifier j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Each application is assigned a one-time budget z An analogous assumption holds for the multi-dimensional QoS vector case. B i "sufficient" for the simulation duration. We also assume that assignments are of the type "all in one bag," i.e., unsplittable. <p> That is, x j i and p j is minimal. Thus, applications are assumed to assign a nonzero utility to "money." If no such service class j exists|i.e., 8j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, x j fi i |then i submits its traffic to a service class j 0 that most closely meets its QoS requirements, however, paying a price of p j 0 + ffi where ffi &gt; 0 is a bid parameter. <p> Let A j denote the set of applications i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> currently assigned to service class j 2 [1; m]. Let j = jA j j i2A j That is, j = ( j s ) T is the average application QoS requirement vector of applications currently assigned to class j. <p> Let A j denote the set of applications i 2 [1; n] currently assigned to service class j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Let j = jA j j i2A j That is, j = ( j s ) T is the average application QoS requirement vector of applications currently assigned to class j.
