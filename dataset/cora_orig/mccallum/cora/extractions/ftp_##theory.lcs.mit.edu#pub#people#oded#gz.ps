Abstract: We provide another proof of the Sipser-Lautemann Theorem by which BPP MA ( PH). The current proof is based on strong results regarding the amplification of BPP, due to Zuck-erman. Given these results, the current proof is even simpler than previous ones. Furthermore, extending the proof leads to two results regarding MA: MA ZPP NP (which seems to be new), and that two-sided error MA equals MA. Finally, we survey the known facts regarding the fragment of the polynomial-time hierarchy which contains MA.

Reference-contexts: The class MA, introduced by Babai <ref> [1] </ref>, consists of languages having a Merlin-Arthur proof system: The prover (Merlin) sends a certificate (denoted w above) to the verifier (Arthur) who assesses it probabilistically (by tossing coins r and applying the predicate V ). <p> Merlin-Arthur proof systems are a degenerate type of interactive proof systems (introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff [7] and Babai <ref> [1] </ref>). Actually, in a Merlin-Arthur proof system there is no real interaction. <p> iff M A (x) = 1, for all x's. * A language L is in RP if there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time machine M such that x 2 L =) Prob (M (x) = 1) 1 x 62 L =) Prob (M (x) = 1) = 0 Definition 6 (AM <ref> [1] </ref> a class of the 1980's:) A language L is in AM if there exists a polynomial-time recognizable 3-ary relation V and polynomials p; q so that 6 * If x 2 L then for every r 2 f0; 1g p (jxj) there exists w 2 f0; 1g q (jxj) so <p> V (x; r; w) = 1) 1 where the probability is taken uniformly over all r 2 f0; 1g p (jxj) . The class AM, introduced by Babai <ref> [1] </ref>, consists of languages having an Arthur-Merlin proof systems: The verifier (Arthur) challenges the prover (Merlin) with a random query, denoted r, and given the prover's answer (denoted w) makes a decision using the predicate V . <p> In contrast to Merlin-Arthur systems, here we have a real interaction between the prover and the verifier. The class AM coincides with the class of languages having constant-round interactive proof systems <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. Thus, it is the lowest level of the hierarchy of "real" interactive proofs [1, 7] (i.e., interactive proofs, which unlike N P and MA, are really interactive). <p> In contrast to Merlin-Arthur systems, here we have a real interaction between the prover and the verifier.

Reference-contexts: In particular, it is widely believed that BPP is very close to P.

Reference-contexts: More efficient amplification procedures, utilizing Expander Random Walks and other tricks, yield the same error bound while using only p (jxj) + (4 + o (1)) t (jxj) coins (see survey <ref> [6] </ref>). In particular, for any constant c &gt; 4, using a sufficiently large polynomial t, we get a procedure which uses c t (jxj) coins and has error probability bounded by 2 t (jxj) .

Reference-contexts: Our proof relies on powerful results regarding randomness-efficient error reduction (a.k.a amplification) for BPP. Given these powerful results, our proof is almost a triviality. Using similiar arguments, we show that MA ZPP NP (re-establishing a theorem of Zachos and Heller <ref> [14] </ref> by which BPP ZPP NP ). It follows that N P BPP ZPP NP . To the best of our knowledge, these results were not known before. The purpose of this note is three-fold: Firstly to demonstrate the power of the currently known results regarding randomness-efficient error reduction. <p> Thus, the ZPP machine either gives the correct answer or gives no answer at all. Clearly ZPP = RP " coRP (actualy, ZPP is sometimes defined this way). We start by providing an alternative proof to a result of Zachos and Heller Theorem 4 <ref> [14, P. 132, Cor. 3] </ref>: BPP ZPP NP . Proof: Using the same amplification as above, we construct a probabilistic polynomial-time oracle machine, M , which on input x operates as follows (where m = p (jxj)): 1. Selects 2 f0; 1g uniformly (as guess for L (x)); 4 2.
