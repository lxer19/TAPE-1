Title: An unsupervised neural network for low-level control of a wheeled mobile robot: noise resistance, stability,
Author: Paolo Gaudiano, Eduardo Zalama, and Juan L opez Coronado 
Abstract: We have recently introduced a neural network mobile robot controller (NETMORC) that autonomously learns the forward and inverse odometry of a differential drive robot through an unsupervised learning-by-doing cycle. After an initial learning phase, the controller can move the robot to an arbitrary stationary or moving target while compensating for noise and other forms of disturbance, such as wheel slippage or changes in the robot's plant. In addition, the forward odometric map allows the robot to reach targets in the absence of sensory feedback. The controller is also able to adapt in response to long-term changes in the robot's plant, such as a change in the radius of the wheels. In this article we review the NETMORC architecture and describe its simplified algorithmic implementation, we present new, quantitative results on NETMORC's performance and adaptability under noise-free and noisy conditions, we compare NETMORC's performance on a trajectory-following task with the performance of an alternative controller, and we describe preliminary results on the hardware implementation of NETMORC with the mobile robot ROBUTER.

One point that deserves mention is our use of the term unsupervised. Inspection of our VAM learning law shows that the weights are effectively learning to cancel the difference between the two populations. In fact, Gaudiano and Grossberg [10] referred to this as unsupervised, error-based learning.

Our neural network utilizes two forms of learning: outstar learning and VAM learning. <p> Both this module and the adaptive forward odometric transformation (Sec. II-D) utilize a neural network known as vector associative map, or VAM <ref> [10] </ref>. GAUDIANO, ZALAMA, AND L OPEZ CORONADO: NEURAL NETWORK FOR MOBILE ROBOT CONTROL 5 The VAM is a neural network for adaptive control, consisting of three populations. A target command population, which can be a vector or spatial map, encodes the desired output. <p> In order for this scheme to work, the connections w l;r must be properly configured. The VAM learning law <ref> [10] </ref> modifies connections through an unsupervised learning-by-doing loop. Consider the activity of a DV node at the end of a successful action, whereby the TVC and PVC are the same. If the VAM is calibrated correctly, the DV should be at zero at this time. <p> Our earlier publication describes the effect of varying GO the signal value [38]. Gaudiano and Grossberg <ref> [10] </ref> have shown that VAM learning is fast and stable. Furthermore, learning ceases once the correct weights are found, since at that point the DV goes to zero, and learning stops. <p> VI.
