Abstract: Table 1: Results for different writer dependent/writer independent handwriting recognition tasks msm 400 a 400 2000 (writer msm) 800 (writer msm) 94.7% 98.1% msm 400 b 400 - " - " - 93.2% 96.7% msm 1000 1000 - " - 2000 (writer msm) 90.5% 94.8% msm 10000 10000 - " - " - 82.1% 86.6% data is preprocessed as described in sections 3 and 2. Table 1 summarizes results for different writer independent/writer dependent, single character recognition/cursive handwriting recognition tasks, comparing the local feature representation with the new context bitmap representation. The network used for the writer dependent results in table 1 is trained with approx. 2000 training patterns from a 400 word vocabulary (msm 400 a) and tested without any retraining on different vocabularies with sizes from 400 up to 20000 words. Vocabularies In this paper we have proposed an input representation, which combines dynamic writing information with context bitmaps for achieving high recognition performance using a connectionist recognizer. This input representation has been shown to be appropriate for modeling temporal long range and spatial short range phenomena typically observed in pen trajecto ries. It is superior to other representations, which consider only coordinates as a function of time (see table 1). Using the input representation in conjunction with the MS-TDNN architecture, we can achieve high recognition performances both on single character and cursive handwriting tasks. Work is in progress to improve the baseline correc tion and height normalization and to add a slant cor rection [7]. Currently we are investigating, if the 3 fi 3 context bitmaps should be replaced by 5 fi 5 context bitmaps and reducing the number of input features by using a principal component analysis. Work is also in progress to apply our recognition system to larger writer independent handwriting tasks with vocabulary sizes up to 25000 words. multi 400 400 3000 (15 writers) 2500 (10 writers) - 85.0%
