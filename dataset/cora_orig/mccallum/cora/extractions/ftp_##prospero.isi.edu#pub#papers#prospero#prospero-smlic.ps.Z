Title: Using Prospero to Support Integrated Location-Independent Computing

Abstract: As computers become pervasive, users will access processing, storage, and communication resources from locations that have not been practical in the past. Such users will demand support for location-independent computing. While the basic system components used might change as the user moves from place to place, the appearance of the system should remain constant. In this paper we discuss the role of, and requirements for, directory services in support of integrated, location-independent computing. We focus on two specific problems: the server selection problem and the user location problem. We present solutions to these problems based on the Pros-pero Directory Service. The solutions demonstrate several unique features of Prospero that make it particularly suited for support of location-independent computing.

Reference-contexts: A second concern is privacy; users might not want others to know where they are logged in, or that they are logged in at all. A different approach is taken by the Zephyr [2] system at MIT's Project Athena <ref> [1] </ref>. Zephyr provides a single database that may be consulted when a user's location is needed. This database is replicated for reliability (technically, Zephyr provides a notification service that relies on this database, but it is the database that is of interest here).

Reference-contexts: The primary drawback of this approach is that it doesn't scale very well. A second concern is privacy; users might not want others to know where they are logged in, or that they are logged in at all. A different approach is taken by the Zephyr <ref> [2] </ref> system at MIT's Project Athena [1]. Zephyr provides a single database that may be consulted when a user's location is needed.

Reference-contexts: In traditional distributed systems, the selected resources are then located through remote name maps or directory services such as Sun's Network Information Services (formerly known as Yellow Pages) [6] and Hesiod <ref> [3] </ref>. The mobility of users complicates server selection; the user's choice of resources will often vary according to location. For example, while at home a user might want to use a printer at home and while at work, one down the hall.

Reference-contexts: In the figure, the link labeled root is a reference to the root of the user's file system through which the user sees the same files regardless of the location from which logged in. The Prospero File System is described elsewhere <ref> [4] </ref>. The directory referenced by the sessions link identifies the locations from which the user is logged in and is described in Section 4. In this virtual system, the server selection criteria are encoded in the config/servers directory.

Reference-contexts: These characteristics can be addressed in part through support for customization. Users should be able to choose the resources and objects of interest, and treat the selected resources as a single system <ref> [5] </ref>. The directory service will play a critical role tying together the components of future systems. The requirements for such a directory service are greatly affected by the scale of the system, and the mobility of its users.
