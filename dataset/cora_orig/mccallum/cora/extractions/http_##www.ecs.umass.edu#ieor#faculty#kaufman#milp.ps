Abstract: The dynamic traffic assignment problem is to assign routes to vehicles departing at given times from a set of origins to a set of destinations so as to minimize the average trip time experienced. Since the time to traverse a link will depend upon traffic volume encountered on that link, link times are dynamic. The complex interaction resulting between objective function and constraints makes the dynamic problem significantly more difficult to formulate and solve than the static version. We present a mixed integer linear programming formulation of the problem which is formally derived from a set of traffic flow assumptions. Principal among these is the simplifying assumption that vehicles upon entering a link assume the speed that traffic would attain were the traffic volume encountered on that link in steady-state. A small illustrative subnetwork extracted from the city of Sioux Falls is solved to optimality by IBM's OSL Branch-and-Bound program.

Reference-contexts: II. We assume that vehicles do not pass one another, i.e., that among two platoons traversing a link, the one that enters later does not leave earlier. An inconsistent arc choice is illustrated in Figure 2 (a). (The terminology is from Kaufman and Smith <ref> [9] </ref>, where link consistency is discussed in more detail.) By observing that a nonzero traffic flow entering at experiences link travel time equal to , we write the consistency constraints (3) for all , such that The constraint cannot be applied when (whereas, if , it is vacuous).

Reference-contexts: One possible use of the MILP in large networks is to optimize small subnetworks in isolation. Accordingly, we removed a centrally located subnetwork of four nodes, as shown in Figure 3, from the Sioux Falls network of 24 nodes studied by Leblanc <ref> [10] </ref>. Our small test network has four nodes, eight physical links, and four destinations. We chose to study a five period problem with the standard time interval representing 1.5 minutes.

Reference-contexts: In the dynamic case, the origin-destination demand is allowed to be time-varying so that the number of vehicles passing through a link and the corresponding link travel times become time dependent. Unlike the elegant and complete treatment of the classic static case ( <ref> [14] </ref>, [15]), the dynamic traffic assignment problem is still largely unexplored, at least from a formal point of view, where even its proper formulation is not clearly understood.
