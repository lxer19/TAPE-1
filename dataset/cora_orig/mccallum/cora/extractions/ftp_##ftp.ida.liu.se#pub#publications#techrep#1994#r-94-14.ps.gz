Abstract: IDA Technical Report 1994 LiTH-IDA-R-94-14 ISSN-0281-4250 Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, S-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden The range of applicability of Abstract We present assessments for a number of previously proposed theories of action and change as well as some new ones. Each assessment identifies a class of scenarios for temporal reasoning where the theory is guaranteed to obtain the correct results. For some of the theories we have also obtained upper-bound results on the range of correct applicability. The theories and the their validation criteria use a logic with explicit integer time, and has been generalized to linear and branching metric time. The assessments show how the correctness of each theory depends on factors such as whether actions are deterministic, whether scenarios involve prediction only, or what is the behavior of each type of action within its execution period. The paper describes equally the methodology that has been used for obtaining the assessments, and the assessments themselves. This paper was published in the Journal of Logic and Computation, Vol. 4, some nonmonotonic logics for

(The symbol for the object-to-be-determined is called a "variable" in Chapman's article <ref> [4] </ref>, but in the terms of logic is is better viewed as a constant).

Reference-contexts: Models represent possible histories of the world; those models which satisfy all the statements but violate the "frame" assumption of persistence or inertia are classical but unintended models. Lin and Shoham <ref> [19] </ref> were probably the first to report a validation of a previously proposed theory of action. They showed that chronological minimization is correct for prediction in deterministic situation-calculus theories with strict inertia, i.e. no surprises or qualification, but allowing for ramification. <p> In this way it has sometimes been possible to identify the exact range of applicability of previously proposed theories of action. Different researchers have also used different validation criteria.

This game represents the higher level construct above the level of the trajectories.

Different researchers have also used different validation criteria. Lin and Shoham [19], Lifschitz [17], and Reiter <ref> [28] </ref> relate a nonmonotonic theory over a certain set of "common-sense" axioms, to a monotonic theory over a larger set of axioms which is assumed to capture the full intentions. <p> Lifschitz and Gelfond have introduced a separate specification language A for defining the effects of actions, and used it to define the intended conclusions for reasoning about actions [10]. Kartha [14] applied the same criterion to the theories previously proposed by Baker [2], Pednault [24], and Reiter <ref> [28] </ref>. Baral and Gelfond [3] generalized A to the case of concurrent 3 single-timestep actions and used it for validations as well. These two approaches have only been used for direct validation.

Reference-contexts: Filtering and occlusion are two such improvements which were introduced by the present author in <ref> [30] </ref>. 7.1 Filtering Filtering treats the premise sets scd and obs separately, and defines the selected set of models as M in (t; [[(scd)]] O ) " [[obs]] so that the minimization is imposed "before" the observations.

An assessment of the range of applicability of such previously proposed approaches would be of considerable interest. Many of the previously proposed entailment methods claim to solve a broader range of common-sense reasoning problems, particularly the ramification problem and/or the qualification problem.

Reference-contexts: It also allows chronicles where the order of the actions is only partially specified, like in nonlinear planning [29]. Several of the validations generalize trivially for deterministic ramification, but ramification in nondeterministic chronicles is more difficult and has not been addressed. We have shown in <ref> [34] </ref> that these results generalize easily to the case of branching metric time as well, but for simplicity the present article addresses the special case of integer time. <p> By necessity the present article is fairly brief, and omits most of the proofs as well as some of the details in the definitions. For the full account please refer to the much more detailed presentation in a forthcoming book <ref> [34] </ref>, hereafter referred to as "the book". A preliminary version is available as a departmental technical report. 7 2 The base logic Before proceeding to the underlying semantics I shall outline the syntax and semantics of the logic, called discrete fluent logic, which will be used as the base logic. <p> The present paper has described the general approach and the first generation of results that have been obtained with it. It is intended to use these results as the basis for the continued work. The following results are already complete and are described in the book <ref> [34] </ref>: * Lower-bound and upper-bound assessments for additional entailment methods, including one method (PMON) using the action schema nch which is correctly applicable throughout K-IA without requiring ac tion laws to be written in uniform form. * The assessments in this paper have been concerned with a completeness criterion, requiring equality

Reference-contexts: Given this variety of validation criteria one may also consider to what extent they are equivalent and exchangable. A first step towards such an analysis has been reported by Thielscher <ref> [38] </ref>, who identified the relationship between the A language of Gelfond and Lifschitz and a subset of the underlying semantics that is used in the present paper. 1.2 Intended models and common sense The systematic methodology introduces a two-step process for going from common sense to logic: first one attempts to
