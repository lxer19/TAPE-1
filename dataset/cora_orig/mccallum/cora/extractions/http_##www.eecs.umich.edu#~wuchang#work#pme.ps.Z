Abstract: This paper examines the use of adaptable priority marking for providing soft bandwidth guarantees to individual connections or connection groups over the Internet. In contrast to other proposals for service differentiation which focus on providing firm performance guarantees, the proposed scheme does not require resource reservation for individual connections and can be supported with minimal changes to the network infrastructure. It uses modest support from the network in the form of priority handling for appropriately marked packets and relies on intelligent transmission control mechanisms at the edges of the network to achieve the desired throughput levels. The paper describes the control mechanisms and evaluates their behavior in various network environments. These mechanisms are shown to have several salient features which make them suitable for deployment in an evolving Internet.

Reference-contexts: While this service architecture provides a solid foundation for providing different classes of service in the Internet, it mandates significant changes to the Internet infrastructure. Because of this, a more evolutionary approach to provide service differentiation in the Internet using the type-of-service (ToS) bits in the IP header <ref> [1, 7, 8, 18, 19] </ref> has recently gained a lot of momentum. The crux of these proposals [4, 10, 12] is to 1 define a simple set of mechanisms for handling packets with different priorities reflected in the ToS bits in the packet header.

Reference-contexts: For example, consider a more elaborate service architecture where additional priority bits are used direct traffic into different ered queues. These queues are then served using any one of various proposed queueing disciplines, such as weighted-fair queueing, class-based queueing, or even strict priority queueing. class-based queue <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. In this example, the the class-based queue is configured to provide applications and/or hosts in one class (A) with at least 70 percent of the allocated bandwidth. The remaining 30 percent of the bandwidth is allocated to the other class (B).

Reference-contexts: This is in some sense similar to the linear increase algorithm for congestion avoidance used by tcp <ref> [13] </ref>. As shown in Figure 6, we compute an estimated number of marked packets in flight (pwnd) by taking the estimated congestion window given as the product of the observed bandwidth and the estimated round-trip time (rtt) and multiplying it by the marking probability.

A salient feature of our scheme is that it provides performance incentives for applications to adapt to network dynamics and help avoid congestion collapse. <p> In effect, the non-responsive flow obtains all of the available best-effort bandwidth while shutting out all other well-behaved connections. In order to provide more fairness between connections competing for best-effort bandwidth, we enhanced the bottleneck ered queue with additional fairness mechanisms based on fred <ref> [14] </ref>. Figure 17 (b) shows the results of the experiment. As the figure shows, when the non-responsive flow begins transmitting at a rate higher than 3M bs, the pme reduces its marking to zero as described earlier.

Reference-contexts: While pricing is not the focus of this study, we note that one of the key advantages of the proposed architecture is that it can provide simple mechanisms for calculating near-optimal prices based on congestion costs <ref> [15] </ref>. In the following sections, we demonstrate the efficacy and the robustness of the proposed framework. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed architecture adapts with the traffic dynamics in the Internet to eliminate the risk of congestion collapse.

Reference-contexts: That is, the changes in the marking probability get smaller as the observed bandwidth nears the target bandwidth. This scaling damps the amplitude of oscillations of the marking probability. In order to understand the effect of packet marking, we simulated a simple scenario using the ns <ref> [16] </ref> network simulator. As shown in Figure 3, the simulated network consists of six nodes, n0 through n5, and five links connecting them.
