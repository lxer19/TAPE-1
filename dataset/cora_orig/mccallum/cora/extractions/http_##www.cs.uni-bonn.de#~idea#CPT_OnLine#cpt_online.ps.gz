Title: Intelligent Database Environment for Advanced Applications IDEA CPT/OnLine: Accessing Chimera Databases via the World Wide Web  
Note: Copyright 1997 University of Bonn ESPRIT Project 6333 Page 1  
Abstract: Summary: Within the IDEA prolongation phase, the transfer of Chimera technology to the World-Wide Web has been the major overall goal. In this context, we investigated several approaches for making the Chimera Prototyping Tool (CPT) developed at the University of Bonn accessible via the Web. Whereas graphical schema design turned out to be too hard to provide with the currently available means, we designed and implemented a data manipulation and querying interface for accessing existing Chimera databases via the Web. CPT/OnLine provides such access to Chimera databases using the CPT. This document describes architecture and usage of CPT/OnLine.

Reference-contexts: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The problem of how to get data typed in by a user to a web browser into the CPT client program has been solved with the help of the Pillow system developed at the Technical University of Madrid <ref> [CHV96] </ref>. Introductory CGI help and a very useful script for forever-running server processes have been provided by Walter Steiner from our department's technical support group.

Reference-contexts: Having opened a specific database, the first DML page is offered to the user (figure 4). The main part of this page is the text area where the user may type in a Chimera data manipulation command in the syntax as it is accepted by the CPT <ref> [GLM96, GL96] </ref>. This command must be closed by a semicolon (;). The "Clear Command" button resets the text area.

Reference-contexts: Although the focus of the IDEA group at the University of Bonn for the prolongation phase was on the completion of our Chimera tools, we decided to investigate the possibility to make our Chimera tools | especially the Chimera Prototyping Tool <ref> [GLM96] </ref> | accessible via the Web. For this sake, we evaluated several possibilities for providing database functionality over the internet with respect to their feasibility in the context of the IDEA prolongation phase. <p> Having opened a specific database, the first DML page is offered to the user (figure 4). The main part of this page is the text area where the user may type in a Chimera data manipulation command in the syntax as it is accepted by the CPT <ref> [GLM96, GL96] </ref>. This command must be closed by a semicolon (;). The "Clear Command" button resets the text area.
