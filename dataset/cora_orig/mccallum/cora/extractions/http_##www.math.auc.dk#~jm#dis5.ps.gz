Reference-contexts: polygons, other approaches may be more appropriate including the following: the marked point process approach in [8]; or the more flexible but technical approach of deformable template matching in [73]; or the elements of both these approaches as combined in [171]; or other types of polygonal models as investigated in <ref> [1, 146, 155] </ref>. 2.2 Modelling spatial interaction in point processes In the following we consider for simplicity finite point processes defined on a Borel set S R d with 0 &lt; (S) &lt; 1 where denotes Lebesgue measure.

Reference-contexts: As Voronoi tessellations can be updated locally, they play an important role in many statistical applications as a convenient tool for speeding up computations (see, e.g., [166]). Moreover, in a Bayesian context, Voronoi tessellations in combination with conditional auto-regressions have been used in <ref> [2, 81, 80] </ref> for generating random and smoothed step functions which approximate the intensity function of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process.

Reference-contexts: These models have some similarity to the Quermass interaction processes for random sets studied in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> It is well-known that MPPs provide a rich class of models for regular patterns, but not so much for modelling clustering as discussed in [P, Section 4.2].

Reference-contexts: In general, at a physical large scale spatial heterogeneity may very well be the dominating factor, whereas small scale properties may mainly be explained by the interactions between the points. This is further studied in our ongoing research project <ref> [7] </ref>, but primarily for another type of models obtained by thinning from a homogeneous Markov point process. Finally, let me mention how LGCPs can naturally be extended to a space-time model.

Reference-contexts: Maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation based on (20) is computationally equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation in an inhomogeneous Poisson process. In practice the integral in (20) may be approximated by numerical methods. As noticed in <ref> [11] </ref> the GLIM-package can be used to provide an approximate MPLE if fl is of a certain form. If the density f belongs to an exponential family, then P L T (; x) is log concave (see [F, Proposition 2.3]).

Reference-contexts: In the special case where ~ x is the Dirichlet relation and d = 2, (13) implies that the density of an NNMPP contains interaction terms corresponding to the nuclei, edges, and vertices of the Voronoi cells (see [A] and <ref> [12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The same is true for many other NNMPPs as recently established in <ref> [13] </ref>. Another related question is phase transition (defined in the same way as in Section 2.1).

Reference-contexts: inference for log Gaussian Cox processes. 3.1 Metropolis-Hastings simulation Lattice processes and spatial point processes with a fixed number of points are nothing but multivariate distributions so that common Monte Carlo algorithms such as the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis algorithm may apply; in the case of lattice processes, see <ref> [176, 21, 15] </ref>; for point processes with a fixed number of points, see the review in [P, Section 3.1]. In the sequel I shall therefore concentrate on Metropolis-Hastings simulation for finite point processes with a random number of points.

Reference-contexts: Besag [14] extended the definition of the pseudo-likelihood function to the Strauss process (9) by combining (19) with an approximation of the Strauss process given by an auto-Poisson lattice process (see <ref> [16] </ref>). Based on this derivation a general expression of the pseudo-likelihood for point processes is stated in [167]. The pseudo-likelihood for point processes (in a general setting including marked point processes) is derived by a direct argument in [F, Section 2].

Reference-contexts: Clifford [33] discusses the history and further development of this characterisation result which goes back to 1970. Besag <ref> [17] </ref> is responsible for introducing MRFs in the context of spatial statistics. <p> This is further extended in [N] to models with discrete and continuous state spaces and where some kind of attraction or repulsion is present, including locally specified exponential family models with applications in spatial statistics such as auto-binomial, auto-Poisson, auto-negative-binomial, auto-gamma models and certain pairwise-difference interaction models (see <ref> [17, 40, 72] </ref>). Briefly, the perfect simulation algorithms in [N] are based on Gibbs sampling, and the lower and upper chains are obtained by `scaling' from a dominating Markov chain | indeed the techniques used in [N] are much inspired by our approach in [107]. <p> In order to avoid this problem, Besag [18] extended the `coding' technique for lattice processes in <ref> [17] </ref> to obtain a pseudo-likelihood function. As in Section 2.1, consider for simplicity a probability mass function p for a discrete model with unknown parameter 2 fi to be estimated from data x = (x i ) i2I , where I is a finite index set.

Reference-contexts: Now, suppose that we have observed a point pattern X " W = x. For simulation from the conditional distribution of the Gaussian process given the data we use in [T] a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) as suggested in <ref> [20] </ref> and further studied in [170]. This is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with collective updating inspired by the definition of a Langevin diffusion.

In the sequel I shall therefore concentrate on Metropolis-Hastings simulation for finite point processes with a random number of points. <p> In either case we can consider the random cluster process as an auxiliary process used for simulating the Ising model. Various extensions of the Swendsen-Wang algorithm have been suggested, most of them for applications in statistical mechanics (e.g., <ref> [47, 21, 51] </ref> and the references therein). <p> Swendsen-Wang type algorithms seem only to be effective if a special structure is exploited (see <ref> [47, 21, 51] </ref>). A more general auxiliary variable algorithm is simulated tempering [116, 66].

Reference-contexts: Since the pair correlation functions are identical for all times t &gt; 0, we may start by analysing the largest observed point pattern X (m) and next investigate the deletion probabilities p (m 1); : : : ; p (1). Currently, in <ref> [26] </ref>, we are further extending this approach to multitype space-time LGCPs in a study of weeds. 3 Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and statisti cal inference for lattice and point processes In Section 3.1 Metropolis-Hastings algorithms [130, 79] adapted for spatial processes are reviewed and compared with the competing approach of <p> Thereby we can estimate the mean function of the Gaussian process by combining the non-parametric estimates with (16). Finally, we may proceed as in the homogeneous case considered above, fitting parametric isotropic covariance models, doing a model check, and making predictions as further discussed in <ref> [26] </ref>. 4 Random tessellations A tessellation of the d-dimensional Eucledian space is a subdivision of R d into d-dimensional non-overlapping sets called cells, crystals, regions, tiles, etc. depending on the particular application (most work on tessellations focus on the space R d , but subdivisions of other spaces like the (d

Reference-contexts: Also exploratory analysis for estimating the `burn-in' (i.e., the number of transitions needed to be thrown away before collecting samples) and to detect badly mixing chains have to the best of my knowledge only been studied in the literature in connection to MCMC algorithms (see <ref> [38, 27] </ref>, [C], [P, Appendix A], and the references therein).

Reference-contexts: The two approaches of using either a spatial birth-and-death process or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm are compared in [C, P]. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involves fewer calculations and is easier to program, but whether it runs faster depends of course on the implementation (see <ref> [34] </ref>). Further, its theoretical properties are easier to analyse.

Reference-contexts: This function L factorizes into five terms, and based on three of these terms a partial likelihood function in the sense of Cox <ref> [39] </ref> can be derived. Existence of maximum likelihood estimates and maximum partial likelihood estimates, model checking, confidence intervals, and log-likelihood ratios for various statistical hypotheses are then discussed. In conclusion, compared to lattice and spatial point processes, the likelihood analysis is much more tractable.

Briefly, the perfect simulation algorithms in [N] are based on Gibbs sampling, and the lower and upper chains are obtained by `scaling' from a dominating Markov chain | indeed the techniques used in [N] are much inspired by our approach in [107].

Extensions of point processes to R d will be briefly discussed later on in this section.

Reference-contexts: This may be due to the skewness and heavytailedness of the log Gaussian distribution combined with the correlation structure of exp ( ~ Y ). For the Scots pine saplings, the posterior mean of the intensity surface is quite peaked and different from a non-parametric kernel estimate proposed in <ref> [44] </ref>. To study these estimates under known conditions, a simulation study is reported in [T, Section 8]. Both for the Scots pine saplings and in the simulation study, the posterior mean appeared to be the best estimate.

Reference-contexts: Voronoi tessellations appear as the special case with all crystals being convex, i.e. when all birth times t i are equal. Johnson-Mehl tessellations have been introduced as simplified models for crystal growth as discussed in papers by Kolmogorov, Johnson and Mehl and others <ref> [110, 99, 3, 4, 5, 48] </ref>. The so-called ASTM model, which is frequently used in metallurgy, can be described by a Johnson-Mehl tessellation (see [90]). <p> are allowed to occur: in the non-spherical case when, for example, crystals grow as boxes, crystals given by (39) may be disconnected; and if the growth rate decreases as a function of the distance to the nucleus, then nuclei may lie outside the crystals (39) which they generate; see also <ref> [48, 68, 133] </ref>. Similar problems occur if nuclei grow with constant but different velocities. The geometric structure of Johnson-Mehl tessellations is more complicated than for Voronoi tessellations as explained in [J, R].

As pointed out in <ref> [50] </ref>, when using CFTP in general, the impatient user may then introduce a bias in the result if the running time (in our case I) and the output (in our case (X 0 ; Y 0 )) are dependent.

Illuminating figures of this construction can be found in <ref> [115, 55] </ref>. A part of a planar Johnson-Mehl tessellation is shown in Figure 4.

Statistical aspects of tessellations are discussed below. 55 Mostly non-parametric statistics and moment based methods have been considered.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, statistical inference for spatial point 37 processes has been performed conditional on the number n of points, proba-bly mainly for computational convenience, but also because it is often claimed that n provides little information about the interaction parameter which is usually the feature of primary interest (see <ref> [56] </ref>). For example, in the case of the Strauss process (9), the density of the conditional Strauss process with respect to the binomial process, f (xjn) / fl s (x) depends only on the interaction parameter fl.

Uniqueness of Gibbs measures for the random cluster and penalized Ising models are investigated in [74, 194], but a study of phase transition behaviour for other types of MCCFs which are not MRFs remains to be done.

It is satisfied by many point process models (see <ref> [64, 107] </ref>) including the specific models discussed below, but one example, where Ruelle but not local stability may be satisfied, is a pairwise interaction point process with density f (x) / fi n (x) f~;gx:~6= where fi &gt; 0 is a parameter and g is a strictly positive function with g <p> Incidentally, as discussed further in Section 3, local stability also plays an important role in the simulation algorithms studied in [C] and <ref> [64, 107] </ref>.

Alternatively an iterative procedure as described in <ref> [65] </ref> may be used. <p> Discussions on how to determine the burn-in and the spacing between samples can be found in <ref> [65, 64] </ref>, [C], and the references therein. Similarly for missing data problems. Suppose that we can write X = (Y; Z) where only data Y = y fl is observed.

Reference-contexts: Results obtained by numerical integration are briefly discussed below. For d 3, Gilbert <ref> [68] </ref> used (30) to obtain an integral expression for the variance of the size of the typical Poisson-Voronoi cell and typical sectional cells. Covariances and variances of other kind of characteristics can be calculated as well; in general the details are intricate. <p> are allowed to occur: in the non-spherical case when, for example, crystals grow as boxes, crystals given by (39) may be disconnected; and if the growth rate decreases as a function of the distance to the nucleus, then nuclei may lie outside the crystals (39) which they generate; see also <ref> [48, 68, 133] </ref>. Similar problems occur if nuclei grow with constant but different velocities. The geometric structure of Johnson-Mehl tessellations is more complicated than for Voronoi tessellations as explained in [J, R]. <p> This implies deviations from the mean value relations which hold for Voronoi tessellations when d 3 (see [J, Section 4.2]). The case d = 1 has been studied in detail in [129], but as discussed in <ref> [68] </ref> the results do not lead to much insight for Johnson-Mehl tessellations in higher dimensions. Most authors consider birth processes which are Poissonian with a constant intensity, i.e. the intensity measure is both time-homogeneous and invariant under translations in R d (stationarity), but the time-inhomogeneous case 52 square.

In order to avoid this problem, Besag [18] extended the `coding' technique for lattice processes in [17] to obtain a pseudo-likelihood function. <p> Further, multi-modality of the likelihood function may cause problems for any optimization method including the MCMC likelihood method. Examples of applications of the MCMC likelihood method within spatial statistics and stochastic geometry are discussed in [C, U] and <ref> [64, 78] </ref>; many others may be expected to appear in the future when the possibility for making a detailed likelihood analysis in many situations is realised. <p> We show in <ref> [78] </ref> how MCMC likelihood methods for such missing data problems apply on the Boolean and other related models from stochastic geometry. One question addressed in [C] is conditional and unconditional inference in the Strauss process (9).

Reference-contexts: Johnson-Mehl tessellations have been introduced as simplified models for crystal growth as discussed in papers by Kolmogorov, Johnson and Mehl and others [110, 99, 3, 4, 5, 48]. The so-called ASTM model, which is frequently used in metallurgy, can be described by a Johnson-Mehl tessellation (see <ref> [90] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Similarly 35 for the Ising model, where in the two-dimensional case the MLE `senses' the critical point in a way that the MPLE does not (see [62, 65]); in the one-dimensional case the MPLE is not optimal within a natural class of estimating functions considered in <ref> [95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This seems to be explained by the fact that the Strauss process belongs to an exponential family model and its minimal canonical statistic (n (X); s (X)) appears to be approximately normally distributed.

Reference-contexts: Voronoi tessellations appear as the special case with all crystals being convex, i.e. when all birth times t i are equal.

Reference-contexts: Usually point patterns are broadly classified as clustered or regular compared to CSR (see, e.g., [43, 177]). Often a regular or clustered behaviour is expected to be explained by some sort of a local Markov property expressed in terms of the Papangelou conditional intensity <ref> [100] </ref> given by fl (x; ~) = f (x [ f~g)=f (x); x 2 ; ~ 2 S n x (taking a=0 = 0 for a 0).

Reference-contexts: Yet another ongoing research project concerns inference problems in the situation where a spatial point process is observed on the edges (or faces) of an unobserved random tessellation (three-dimensional configurations of pores in translucent alumina provide examples of such situations, see <ref> [101] </ref>). In [189] we carry out a Bayesian analysis for estimating the parameters of the entire process and the underlying random tessellation.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, as the pseudo-likelihood only depends on the local dependence structure, global information may better be taken into account when using the likelihood function than the pseudo-likelihood function.

Reference-contexts: Ripley and Kelly used (8) to establish a spatial Markov property of MPPs. The standard example of an MPP is the Strauss process <ref> [181, 103] </ref> with density f (x) / fi n (x) fl s (x) (9) (taking 0 0 = 1) where s (x) = jff~; g x : ~ ~ ; ~ 6= gj is the number of unordered pairs of neighbours in x and fi &gt; 0; 0 fl 1 are <p> (x) / fi n (x) fl s (x) (9) (taking 0 0 = 1) where s (x) = jff~; g x : ~ ~ ; ~ 6= gj is the number of unordered pairs of neighbours in x and fi &gt; 0; 0 fl 1 are parameters (as shown in <ref> [103] </ref> the model is not well-defined for fl &gt; 1). <p> Notice that the density (14) is analogous to that for a Markov connected component field (4) with background colour 0. For modelling purposes it is useful to establish further characterisation results in terms of the Papengelou conditional intensity. Kelly and Ripley <ref> [103] </ref> 21 verified (under a weak condition on S and ~) that the Strauss process (9) is uniquely characterised by the property that fl (x; ~) depends only on the number of neighbours to ~ in x. <p> The traditional approach for simulating from the density f is to generate a sample from a spatial birth-and-death process X (t); t 0; which converges towards f (see <ref> [158, 103, 164] </ref> and [A]).

To be more specific, consider the common situation where, as at the beginning of Section 2.2, we are given a density f of a point process on a bounded Borel set S R d . <p> One idea is to combine CFTP with the thinning technique for generating a spatial birth-and-death from a dominating one (now generated backwards in time and started in equilibrium at time 0) as outlined in Section 3.1. This was first described in <ref> [105] </ref> for the case of the area-interaction process; we are giving the details for the general case of simulating locally stable point processes in [107].

Reference-contexts: A stronger condition than Ruelle stability is local stability: there is a constant K &gt; 0 so that fl (x; ~) K 8x 2 ; ~ 2 S n fxg: (7) Local stability is usually easily verified. It is satisfied by many point process models (see <ref> [64, 107] </ref>) including the specific models discussed below, but one example, where Ruelle but not local stability may be satisfied, is a pairwise interaction point process with density f (x) / fi n (x) f~;gx:~6= where fi &gt; 0 is a parameter and g is a strictly positive function with g <p> Incidentally, as discussed further in Section 3, local stability also plays an important role in the simulation algorithms studied in [C] and <ref> [64, 107] </ref>. In the classical Ripley-Kelly [168] Markov point processes (MPP), fl (x; ~) depends on x only through the neighbours ~ ~ in x to ~, where ~ is a given symmetric and reflexive relation. <p> The proofs of Preston's and my own results are based on a coupling to an ordinary `dominating' birth-and-death process defined on the non-negative integers | a similar coupling is used in the recent papers <ref> [105, 107] </ref> on perfect simulation (see Section 3.2). To be more specific, consider the common situation where, as at the beginning of Section 2.2, we are given a density f of a point process on a bounded Borel set S R d . <p> As discussed in <ref> [107] </ref> and Section 3.2 below, perfect simulation procedures based on each approach | and which make i.i.d. simulations feasible so that it is straightforward to establish a CLT for the Monte Carlo error and estimate the asymptotic variance | have recently been developed, but at the time of writing this thesis <p> and which make i.i.d. simulations feasible so that it is straightforward to establish a CLT for the Monte Carlo error and estimate the asymptotic variance | have recently been developed, but at the time of writing this thesis a comparative study of the two approaches remains to be done in <ref> [107] </ref>. 3.2 Perfect simulation As mentioned in Section 3.1, a common problem in MCMC is that the available theoretical bounds for rates of convergence are not useful in practice. <p> This was first described in [105] for the case of the area-interaction process; we are giving the details for the general case of simulating locally stable point processes in <ref> [107] </ref>. Another idea is to use perfect Metropolis-Hastings sampling. This was first described in [D] for the case of the Widom-Rowlinson [195] mixture model as discussed later on in this section. <p> A perfect Metropolis-Hastings simulation algorithm for locally stable point processes in general, based on CFTP and a special case of the general Metropolis-Hastings algorithms in [C] (not the one considered in detail in Section 3.1), is constructed in <ref> [107] </ref>. It is somewhat more technical to present than that based on spatial birth-and-death processes and it still remains to make some experiments. One very interesting observation concerning the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in [107] is the fact that it is geometrically but not uniformly ergodic (unless there is an upper bound on <p> the general Metropolis-Hastings algorithms in [C] (not the one considered in detail in Section 3.1), is constructed in <ref> [107] </ref>. It is somewhat more technical to present than that based on spatial birth-and-death processes and it still remains to make some experiments. One very interesting observation concerning the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in [107] is the fact that it is geometrically but not uniformly ergodic (unless there is an upper bound on the number of points); this should be contrasted a recent result in [54, Theorem 4.2] which states that successful CFTP algorithms such as those of Propp and Wilson can be constructed if <p> Briefly, the perfect simulation algorithms in [N] are based on Gibbs sampling, and the lower and upper chains are obtained by `scaling' from a dominating Markov chain | indeed the techniques used in [N] are much inspired by our approach in <ref> [107] </ref>. Especially, for an auto-gamma model, as we are using Gibbs sampling on continuous distributions we never get coalescence of the lower and upper paths; however with an arbitrary good accuracy * &gt; 0 we can deliver a perfect simulation within finite time (see [N, Section 3]). <p> As in the original Swendsen-Wang algorithm, it seems difficult to find any useful monotonicity property in our Swendsen-Wang type algorithm. So it would be interesting to see if it is practicable first to use one of our perfect simulation algorithms in <ref> [107] </ref> for simulating the continuum random cluster model (12) with fl = 1=2 and secondly to make a simulation of the Widom-Rowlinson model by step (i) in the Swendsen-Wang type algorithm. Swendsen-Wang type algorithms seem only to be effective if a special structure is exploited (see [47, 21, 51]).

Reference-contexts: The Strauss process is repulsive: if fl = 1, we get a Poisson process on S of rate fi; as fl decreases, realisations tend to be more and more regular; and for fl = 0 we have a (Markov) hard-core point process. Incidentally, in a current research project 19 <ref> [122] </ref>, we have shown that in contrast to many other types of hard-core point process models like Matern hard-core point processes and the simple sequential inhibition process, the planar Strauss process with fl = 0 can produce highly regular patterns with a packing density as close as one wishes to the <p> can be applied for simulating other spatial models 33 such as hard-core point processes with a high packing degree and in missing data problems of marked point processes of geometrical objects which require conditional simulations on a `narrow' part of the state space; these aspects are currently under study in <ref> [78, 122] </ref>. 3.4 Pseudo-likelihood The normalizing constant in the density of many parametric spatial models (including those considered in Section 2) cannot be evaluated explicitly. In order to avoid this problem, Besag [18] extended the `coding' technique for lattice processes in [17] to obtain a pseudo-likelihood function.

Another example is a random hyperplane process, which in the Poisson case provides one of the mathematical most tractable classes of models for random tessellations (see, e.g., <ref> [124, 128] </ref>), but their importance for practical applications seem to be somewhat limited. The cells under hyperplane and Voronoi tessellations are convex, while Johnson-Mehl cells can be non-convex. Probabilistic aspects of Voronoi tessellations are discussed in Sections 4.1-4.4, while Johnson-Mehl tessellations are briefly studied in Section 4.5.

Further, we review certain mean value relations for the geometrical characteristics of the facets of V () and T (). The `practical' planar (d = 2) and spatial (d = 3) cases have been studied in <ref> [126, 127, 162, 177] </ref> and [L]; general definitions and results in d 1 dimensions are given in [I]. These results allow us to parameterize all mean values considered by only a few of them, which in turn often may be easily estimated by non-parametric methods.

Reference-contexts: introduction to the current stage of stochastic geometry and spatial statistics; other useful books on these topics include <ref> [40, 42, 43, 123, 124, 128, 166, 167, 178] </ref>; MCMC methodology is treated in [69, 10], where [10] is concerned with stochastic geometry and spatial statistics as well. <p> The perhaps most important examples are random Voronoi tessellations generated by a point process and Johnson-Mehl tessellations generated by a space-time process. Another example is a random hyperplane process, which in the Poisson case provides one of the mathematical most tractable classes of models for random tessellations (see, e.g., <ref> [124, 128] </ref>), but their importance for practical applications seem to be somewhat limited. The cells under hyperplane and Voronoi tessellations are convex, while Johnson-Mehl cells can be non-convex. Probabilistic aspects of Voronoi tessellations are discussed in Sections 4.1-4.4, while Johnson-Mehl tessellations are briefly studied in Section 4.5.

Reference-contexts: For example, if d = 2 we get 1 = 2 p , which can be inserted into (33). Indeed many of the results when d 3 were already established in <ref> [129] </ref>. Equation (34) has been used for deriving other exact results. In [V] various gamma-type results and conditional independence results between size and shape of different geometrical characteristics determined by a Poisson process are derived. <p> This implies deviations from the mean value relations which hold for Voronoi tessellations when d 3 (see [J, Section 4.2]). The case d = 1 has been studied in detail in <ref> [129] </ref>, but as discussed in [68] the results do not lead to much insight for Johnson-Mehl tessellations in higher dimensions. <p> The formulae have previously been verified in certain special cases. Meijering <ref> [129] </ref> considered the time-homogeneous case fl (dt) = ffdt and with k = d 3, treating each of the cases p = 0; 1; 2 separately. Miles [133] stated the results for the inhomogeneous case when k = d = 3 but without including a proof.

Reference-contexts: Further desirable properties of the algorithm can be established assuming local stability: it is aperiodic, Harris recurrent, and satisfies a geometrical drift condition so that the Markov chain fX t g generated by the algorithm is geometrically ergodic in the sense of <ref> [131, Theorem 15.0.1] </ref> where f specifies the unique invariant distribution. This was first verified in [C] for the Strauss process and later extended in [64] to locally stable point processes along the same lines as in [C] but now combined with general concepts and results from [131]. <p> This was first verified in [C] for the Strauss process and later extended in [64] to locally stable point processes along the same lines as in [C] but now combined with general concepts and results from <ref> [131] </ref>.

Similar problems occur if nuclei grow with constant but different velocities. The geometric structure of Johnson-Mehl tessellations is more complicated than for Voronoi tessellations as explained in [J, R]. <p> These waiting times are mutually independent and independent of the positions of the nuclei which are generated by a binomial process.

Reference-contexts: So far perfect simulation algorithms in the context of spatial statistics, stochastic geometry, and statistical physics are only practicable for certain relative simple models. However, the possibility of combining perfect simulation with efficient simulation procedures such as simulated tempering (see Section 3.3) are currently something we explore in <ref> [138] </ref>. One obvious advantage of using perfect simulation is the fact that there is no problem with the `burn-in'. Further, i.i.d. sampling is now available so that e.g. asymptotic variances of Monte Carlo estimates can be calculated very directly.

Reference-contexts: are discussed in Section 4.6. 4.1 Introductory remarks on Voronoi tessellations Since Voronoi cells due to their nearest-nucleus definition can be interpret as territories, market areas, crystals etc., Voronoi tessellations provide models for many natural phenomena or processes studied in science and technology; numerous examples of applications are discussed in <ref> [151, 177] </ref> and [L]. A comprehensive collection of results on Voronoi and related tessellations can be found in [151], while a detailed mathematical study is given in [L].

(iii) Yet another generalisation is to replace the Euclidean distance used in the definition (27) of Voronoi cells with another Euclidean metric so that the growth is anisotropic (see [174]). (iv) Indeed many other related tessellations to the Voronoi tessellation have been considered in the literature (see, e.g., <ref> [151] </ref>), but present knowledge on random models for many of these constructions is rather limited and fragmentary. 4.5 Johnson-Mehl tessellations Probabilistic models of tessellations with non-convex cells are more scarce and complex. Johnson-Mehl tessellations form the perhaps most tractable and flex ible class of such models. <p> One problem considered in geographical data processing and other contexts is how to obtain the Voronoi tessellation which best approximates a given tessellation observed within a bounded window (see <ref> [185, 151] </ref>). Partly inspired by [185, 174], we are presently in [175] investigating an approach to likelihood inference based on MCMC methods for polygonal tessellations modelled as noisy versions of Voronoi tessellations.

Reference-contexts: In [S] it is demonstrated that spatial birth-and-death processes can also be useful for modelling certain dynamical spatial processes. Basic properties of spatial birth-and-death processes and the models studied in [S] are shortly discussed below. Preston <ref> [158] </ref> introduced a spatial birth-and-death process as a time-homogeneous Markov process fX (t) : t 0g defined on a state space = S of finite point configurations, where the transitions are of two types: either an addition (`birth') of a point in S to the process or a deletion (`death') of <p> If E = E i with i &gt; 0 then X (t + E) = x n fx i g represents the death of the point x i .

Reference-contexts: Relying on the ergodic approach, [88] reports on a large scale study for approximating the polygonal characteristics of a typical planar Poisson-Voronoi cell by Monte Carlo methods. A more efficient method is based on combining (35) with the radial simulation algorithm <ref> [161] </ref> for a stationary Poisson process in R d . <p> Several simulated results are shown in [L, M] and <ref> [88, 161, 87, 139, 112, 113, 192] </ref>. 4.4.2 Generalisations of Voronoi tessellations As mentioned it is the Slivnyak-Mecke formula (34) which mainly makes the Poisson-Voronoi model and related models relatively tractable for mathematical 50 analysis. <p> For instance, in the case of (M2) with v = 1, we have that t d+fi ~ (fi=(d + fi); ff) is gamma-distributed. In particular, it is shown in [M] how arrivals can be generated by extending a main result in <ref> [161] </ref>, whereby typical Poisson-Johnson-Mehl crystals can be simulated. The empirical results exhibited in [M] under (M2) show remarkably different crystals in two and three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: be included as well; point processes with multiplicities are not so important from an applied point of view but they are useful for technical reasons; but marked point processes such as multitype point patterns, line segment processes, disc processes, etc., find numerous examples of applications; see, for example, [A] and <ref> [43, 177] </ref>. Extensions of point processes to R d will be briefly discussed later on in this section. The Poisson process plays a fundamental role as a reference process. <p> In this section we consider point process models X ~ P which are absolutely continuous with respect to and we denote the density by f = dP=d. Usually point patterns are broadly classified as clustered or regular compared to CSR (see, e.g., <ref> [43, 177] </ref>). <p> The class of Cox processes provides flexible and useful models for aggregated point patterns where the aggregation is due to a stochastic environmental heterogeneity <ref> [40, 42, 43, 177] </ref>. In this section we focus mostly on a particular subclass of Cox processes, viz. the log Gaussian Cox processes introduced in [T]. <p> Then the cells become d-dimensional convex polytopes. Random tessellations are a major subject in stochastic geometry, where a general theory for stationary tessellations has been established during the seventies and the eighties; see [I], <ref> [177] </ref>, and the references therein. Mainly mean value relations between certain geometrical characteristics of the cells have been studied using either Palm measure theory or an ergodic approach. Combining this with stereological results gives relations between characteristics of a random tessellation and its intersection with an affine subspace. <p> Combining this with stereological results gives relations between characteristics of a random tessellation and its intersection with an affine subspace. Many of these relationships are collected and systematic studied in [I] for stationary tessellations with convex cells; see also the review in <ref> [177, Section 10] </ref>; the 41 non-convex case is treated in [198]. Explicit probability models are typically constructed from spatial processes of simple geometrical objects such as points and hyperplanes. <p> are discussed in Section 4.6. 4.1 Introductory remarks on Voronoi tessellations Since Voronoi cells due to their nearest-nucleus definition can be interpret as territories, market areas, crystals etc., Voronoi tessellations provide models for many natural phenomena or processes studied in science and technology; numerous examples of applications are discussed in <ref> [151, 177] </ref> and [L]. A comprehensive collection of results on Voronoi and related tessellations can be found in [151], while a detailed mathematical study is given in [L]. The following Sections 4.2-4.4 are nearly identical to the review in [O] on the probabilistic aspects of Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations. <p> In the following we define the concepts of `typical' cells and facets. Further, we review certain mean value relations for the geometrical characteristics of the facets of V () and T (). The `practical' planar (d = 2) and spatial (d = 3) cases have been studied in <ref> [126, 127, 162, 177] </ref> and [L]; general definitions and results in d 1 dimensions are given in [I]. These results allow us to parameterize all mean values considered by only a few of them, which in turn often may be easily estimated by non-parametric methods. <p> This sectional Voronoi tessellation is in general not a Voronoi tessellation. An important counterexample is provided by a sectional Poisson-Voronoi tessellation (see [32]). General formulae relating the characteristics of the sectional Voronoi tessellation to those of V () can be found in [I, L] and <ref> [177] </ref>. Often isotropy is assumed in order to obtain useful relations, i.e. the distribution of either or L n is assumed to be invariant under rotations about the origin in R d . <p> Often isotropy is assumed in order to obtain useful relations, i.e. the distribution of either or L n is assumed to be invariant under rotations about the origin in R d . Stereo-logical aspects of Voronoi tessellations are further discussed in [I, L] and <ref> [177, Section 1.5.4] </ref>. 4.3 Poisson-Voronoi and Poisson-Delaunay tessellations Throughout this section is assumed to be a stationary Poisson process in R d with intensity 2 (0; 1). <p> Combining (37) with mean value relations as discussed in Section 4.2.2 various mean value characteristics for both the Poisson-Voronoi tessellation and its sectional tessellations can be calculated, see [I, Section 7; R, Theorem 3] and the review in <ref> [177, Section 10.6.1] </ref>. For example, if d = 2 we get 1 = 2 p , which can be inserted into (33). Indeed many of the results when d 3 were already established in [129]. Equation (34) has been used for deriving other exact results. <p> Tables showing Gilbert's and Brakke's results can be found in [L, Section 4.2]. Also figures of Brakke's numerical results for the density functions of the length of the typical planar and spatial Poisson-Voronoi edge are shown; see also [142]. Table 10.4 in <ref> [177] </ref> (based on [136]) shows the distribution of the number of vertices in the typical planar Poisson-Voronoi cell. Also summary statistics as commonly used in stochastic geometry have been considered. <p> Viewing a stationary tessellation as a germ-grain model, non-parametric statistics based on general random set methods apply. In particular it is useful to consider the edges of a planar tessellation as a fiber process, while stereological methods become useful for spatial tessellations (see [I, Section 6] and <ref> [177, Sections 10.8 and 11.5.4] </ref>). Due to the mean value relations for the geometrical and topological characteristics of stationary random tessellations (see, e.g., (32)-(33)), only a few number of mean values need to be estimated.

Reference-contexts: Ripley and Kelly used (8) to establish a spatial Markov property of MPPs. The standard example of an MPP is the Strauss process <ref> [181, 103] </ref> with density f (x) / fi n (x) fl s (x) (9) (taking 0 0 = 1) where s (x) = jff~; g x : ~ ~ ; ~ 6= gj is the number of unordered pairs of neighbours in x and fi &gt; 0; 0 fl 1 are <p> Actually, Strauss <ref> [181] </ref> wanted to construct a model for clustering, so he considered the attractive case fl &gt; 1 which makes sense if we fix the number of points to n (x) = n (with n &gt; 0 a given integer) and consider (9) as a density with respect to Lebesgue measure on

Reference-contexts: In the special case of an auto-logistic model (including the Ising process), finding the MPLE is computationally equivalent to finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) in a logistic-regression model, so a standard statistical computer package can be used for the computations (see <ref> [156, 182] </ref>). Consistency and asymptotic normality of the MPLE for lattice processes (in various settings) have been considered in [59, 75, 76, 67, 35, 36].

Reference-contexts: One problem considered in geographical data processing and other contexts is how to obtain the Voronoi tessellation which best approximates a given tessellation observed within a bounded window (see <ref> [185, 151] </ref>). Partly inspired by [185, 174], we are presently in [175] investigating an approach to likelihood inference based on MCMC methods for polygonal tessellations modelled as noisy versions of Voronoi tessellations. <p> One problem considered in geographical data processing and other contexts is how to obtain the Voronoi tessellation which best approximates a given tessellation observed within a bounded window (see [185, 151]).

Reference-contexts: The computational expense is due to deciding whether a pixel update leads to the division of a component or to the unification of a number of components. Sweeny <ref> [186] </ref> gives a very efficient algorithm for the random cluster model, but it is not applicable for MCCFs in general. We use in [U] an algorithm which works for any MCCF and which is based on standard graph algorithms [37].

Reference-contexts: This problem was drastically reduced with a collective updating algorithm due to Swendsen and Wang <ref> [187] </ref>, which relies on the fact that the Ising model (IM ) and the random cluster model (RCM ) of 0 1 bonds can be defined simultaneously. In the Swendsen-Wang algorithm systematic Gibbs sampling is used by alternating between the conditional distributions IM jRCM and RCM jIM .

Reference-contexts: Setting h (X; ~) = 1 [~ 2 T ] d (X; ~) and omitting the expectation signs in (22) we get (21) (in the case of marked point processes, see [70]). Using other `test functions' h, (22) was used in <ref> [49, 188] </ref> to obtain other estimation equations (the so-called Takacs-Fiksel method). Maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation based on (20) is computationally equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation in an inhomogeneous Poisson process. In practice the integral in (20) may be approximated by numerical methods.

Reference-contexts: Yet another ongoing research project concerns inference problems in the situation where a spatial point process is observed on the edges (or faces) of an unobserved random tessellation (three-dimensional configurations of pores in translucent alumina provide examples of such situations, see [101]). In <ref> [189] </ref> we carry out a Bayesian analysis for estimating the parameters of the entire process and the underlying random tessellation.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out in [50], when using CFTP in general, the impatient user may then introduce a bias in the result if the running time (in our case I) and the output (in our case (X 0 ; Y 0 )) are dependent. Recently, it has been shown in <ref> [190] </ref> how Fill's [50] rejection sampling algorithm can be extended from the finite state space case to the Widom-Rowlinson model (18) when using the two-component Gibbs sampler in [D]; then exact and unbiased results are produced. It is concluded in [190] that Fill's algorithm is approximately as efficient as ours in <p> Recently, it has been shown in <ref> [190] </ref> how Fill's [50] rejection sampling algorithm can be extended from the finite state space case to the Widom-Rowlinson model (18) when using the two-component Gibbs sampler in [D]; then exact and unbiased results are produced. It is concluded in [190] that Fill's algorithm is approximately as efficient as ours in [D], but it needs more memory. Moreover, in [140] we show how Fill's algorithm for attractive finite state space models can be extended to general discrete conditionally specified repulsive models using sandwiching techniques as in [N].

Reference-contexts: Mostly pairwise interaction models with a simple parameterization have been used, i.e. when C (x C ) = 1 whenever jCj 3 (where j j denotes cardinality), but it is increasingly acknowledged that such models are not appropriate to describe the global structures in real images. Tjelmeland and Besag <ref> [191] </ref> demonstrate that interesting and flexible models can be obtained when higher order interaction terms are included, but then the number of parameters to be estimated may grow rapidly.

Reference-contexts: assumption. 42 independent and uniformly distributed points on the unit square. 4.2.1 Geometric constraints and properties Most probabilistic models for the point process of nuclei (which generates the Voronoi tessellation) are very different from the highly regular patterns of nuclei used in the seminal work of Dirichlet [46] and Voronoi <ref> [193] </ref>. In this section we discuss the conditions to be satisfied by the nuclei of a Voronoi tessellation in order to establish the mean value relations in Section 4.2.2.

Reference-contexts: Consider the binary 62 fi 67 image in Figure 1 (top left) taken from [U, Figure 1]. The maximum likelihood estimate of fi (obtained by MCMC methods as discussed in Section 3.5) is supercritical under the Ising model ( ^ fi = :481), but according to <ref> [194] </ref> subcritical under the penalized Ising model ( ^ fi = :483 and ^fl = 17:643). <p> Uniqueness of Gibbs measures for the random cluster and penalized Ising models are investigated in <ref> [74, 194] </ref>, but a study of phase transition behaviour for other types of MCCFs which are not MRFs remains to be done. The application of MCCFs is somewhat more computationally demanding than the application of MRFs.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that MPPs provide a rich class of models for regular patterns, but not so much for modelling clustering as discussed in [P, Section 4.2]. One exception is the area-interaction process <ref> [9, 195] </ref> (or more generally, the Quermass interaction processes in [6]), which has interactions of arbitrarily high order. <p> Another idea is to use perfect Metropolis-Hastings sampling. This was first described in [D] for the case of the Widom-Rowlinson <ref> [195] </ref> mixture model as discussed later on in this section. A perfect Metropolis-Hastings simulation algorithm for locally stable point processes in general, based on CFTP and a special case of the general Metropolis-Hastings algorithms in [C] (not the one considered in detail in Section 3.1), is constructed in [107].

Yet another approach is iterative stochastic approximations to the MLE based on stochastic gradient algorithms <ref> [197, 141] </ref>. For reviews on many of these methods and their history, see [167, 65, 45, 64].

Reference-contexts: Many of these relationships are collected and systematic studied in [I] for stationary tessellations with convex cells; see also the review in [177, Section 10]; the 41 non-convex case is treated in <ref> [198] </ref>. Explicit probability models are typically constructed from spatial processes of simple geometrical objects such as points and hyperplanes. The perhaps most important examples are random Voronoi tessellations generated by a point process and Johnson-Mehl tessellations generated by a space-time process.
