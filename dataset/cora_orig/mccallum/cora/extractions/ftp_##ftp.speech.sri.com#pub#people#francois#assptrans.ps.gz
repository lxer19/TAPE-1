Title: Transform-Domain Adaptive Filters: An Analytical Approach.  
Author: Fran~coise Beaufays 
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering Stanford University  
Abstract: Transform-domain adaptive filters refer to LMS filters whose inputs are preprocessed with a unitary data-independent transformation followed by a power normalization stage. The transformation is typically chosen to be the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), although other transformations such as the cosine transform (DCT), the Hartley transform (DHT), or the Walsh-Hadamard transform, have also been proposed in the literature. The resulting algorithms are generally called DFT-LMS, DCT-LMS, etc. This preprocessing improves the eigenvalue distribution of the input autocorrelation matrix of the LMS filter, and, as a consequence, ameliorates its convergence speed. In this paper, we start with a brief intuitive explanation of transform-domain algorithms. We then analyze the effects of the preprocessing performed in DFT-LMS and DCT-LMS for first-order Markov inputs. In particular, we show that for Markov-1 inputs of correlation parameter 2 [0; 1], the eigenvalue spread after DFT and power normalization tends to (1 + )=(1 ) as the size of the filter gets large, while after DCT and power normalization it reduces to (1 + ). For comparison, the eigenvalue spread before transformation is asymptotically equal to (1 + ) 2 =(1 ) 2 . The analytical method used in the paper provides additional insight on how the algorithms work, and is expected to extend to other input signal classes and other transformations.

Reference-contexts: The transformed signals, u k (i), are then normalized by the square root of their power, P k (i). The powers P k (i) can be estimated, for example, by filtering the u 2 k (i) with an exponentially decaying window 3 of parameter fi 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The resulting equal power signals, v k (i), are inputted to an adaptive linear combiner whose weights, w k (i), are adjusted using the LMS algorithm. Complex LMS [12] is used in DFT-LMS, real LMS is used in DCT-LMS. The two algorithms are summarized below. <p> Such a filter has an impulse response that decreases geometrically with a rate given by the z-plane position of the filter pole.

Conclusion The previous results are summarized as follows. * The eigenvalue spread of the autocorrelation matrix of a first-order Markov signal of parameter 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> tends to (1 + ) 2 =(1 ) 2 as the size n of the matrix increases. * The eigenvalue spread of the autocorrelation matrix of the same signal after DFT and after power normalization tends to (1 + )=(1 ) as the size n of the matrix increases.

Reference-contexts: Unitary transformations perform only rotations and symmetries, they do not modify the shape of the object they transform. 4 The mean square error of an LMS filter is a quadratic function of its weight vector <ref> [3] </ref>. Writing the MSE as a function of the weights and fixing it to some constant level, one gets an implicit quadratic function that represents a hyperellipsoid in the n-dimensional weight space.
