Title: The BaBar Silicon Vertex Tracker  
Author: Jeffrey D. Richman

Abstract: The BaBar Silicon Vertex Tracker is a five-layer, double-sided silicon-strip detector designed to perform vertex measurements of B decays at the PEP-II asymmetric e + e collider. I discuss the main detector design considerations and features, as well as preliminary measurements of the combined noise of the detector and its readout system.
