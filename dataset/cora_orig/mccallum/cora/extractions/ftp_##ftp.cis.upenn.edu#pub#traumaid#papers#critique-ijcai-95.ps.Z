Reference-contexts: Some of the earliest plan recognition techniques were developed for plans with diagnostic actions (e.g., questions about train departures and arrivals) in order to respond to them cooperatively <ref> [ Allen and Perrault, 1980; Litman and Allen, 1987 ] </ref> . The tradition has continued in work by Lambert & Carberry [ Lambert and Carberry, 1991 ] , Pollack [ Pollack, 1986 ] , Ramshaw [ Ramshaw, 1991 ] , and others. <p> To handle the ambiguity that often results from the fact that a set of observed actions can be compatible with several underlying plans, previous plan recognition systems have used heuristics to prefer one explanation over others <ref> [ Allen and Perrault, 1980; Carberry, 1988 ] </ref> . However, as [ van Beek et al., 1993 ] have pointed out, it is not always necessary to disambiguate a plan if the ambiguity does not affect the system's response.

Reference-contexts: ourselves to making some points about the diagnostic use of actions, including the use of diagnostic strategies, and then describing how plan recognition and evaluation techniques in TraumaTIQ, an interface for critiquing multiple trauma management, reflect these points. 2 Use of Diagnostic Actions in Plans Consider an agent as in <ref> [ Bratman et al., 1988 ] </ref> who reacts to the world by forming goals, who reasons to decide which goals to adopt and attempt to satisfy in which order, and who then acts on his or her decisions.

Reference-contexts: A blinded comparison of management plans was carried out by a panel of three experienced trauma surgeons. They preferred TraumAID 2.0's plans to actual management to a statistically significant extent <ref> [ Clarke et al., 1993 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: These efforts have all started from specific types of questions (and answers). Our work on using plan recognition in support of generating clinically relevant real-time critiques of physician orders during the initial definitive management of multiple trauma <ref> [ Gert-ner, 1994a; 1994b; Gertner et al., 1994 ] </ref> , has led us to consider the more basic issues of when diagnostic actions are used and what they allow agents to achieve. <p> The plan recognizer described here is a component of TraumaTIQ, TraumAID's critiquing interface <ref> [ Gertner et al., 1994 ] </ref> . TraumaTIQ was developed to provide clinically relevant feedback to physicians based on the orders they make for procedures during the management of trauma patients.

Reference-contexts: If four or more hypotheses score close to the leader, for each such hypothesis, Internist formulates and asks questions that would eliminate it from further consideration. In the domain of pathology, Pathfinder <ref> [ Horvitz et al., 1984 ] </ref> used somewhat different strategies which were felt to more accurately reflect the diagnostic practices of experienced pathologists. In particular, Pathfinder replaces Internist's Discriminate Mode with a questioning strategy, Group Discriminate Mode, that can discriminate among more than two diseases. <p> While the questions resulting from considerations of entropy were the most discriminating among the diseases in the differential, the strategy had to be replaced when Pathfinder's physician users complained that they couldn't understand the rationale for (i.e., recognize the plan behind) the questions they were being asked <ref> [ Horvitz et al., 1984 ] </ref> . In the initial definitive management of multiple trauma, different strategies are used.

On the other hand, in the initial definitive management of multiple trauma, physicians carry out diagnostic actions primarily for purposes of goal selection and goal refinement.

In the case of TraumaTIQ, plan recognition is being done ultimately for quality assurance.
