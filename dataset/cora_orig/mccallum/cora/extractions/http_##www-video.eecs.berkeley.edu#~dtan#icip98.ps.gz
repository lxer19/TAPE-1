Abstract: We introduce a point to point video transmission scheme over the Internet combining a low-delay TCP-friendly transport protocol in conjunction with a novel, real-time, error-resilient layered compression method. Compressed video is packetized into individually decodable packets that are of equal expected visual importance. As a result, relatively constant video quality can be achieved at the receiver under lossy conditions. The packets can be truncated to meet the time varying bandwidth imposed by the transport protocol. Actual Internet experiments together with simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the combined scheme.

Reference-contexts: In MPEG-1, a slice, which corresponds to a rectangular strip in a picture, is the smallest unit that can be decoded independently. Packetization then is performed so that no slice is split across different packets unless the slice size exceeds the packet size <ref> [1] </ref>. In the last two plots of Fig. 6, 10 slices are used per frame and it is assumed that headers in the picture, group of pictures, and sequence levels are transmitted error free.

Reference-contexts: It would take at least seven packet losses to completely eradicate a particular spatial region. subbands to form a component. Each coefficient block is progressively quantized and compressed independent of other blocks using layered block coding <ref> [5] </ref>. However, subsequent quantizer outputs of the same block are compressed inter-dependently. To achieve error resilience, the compressed quantization layers are packed in a pre-determined order based on the relative importance of the subbands while preserving the dependency between quantization layers. <p> Each subband is then divided into 256 coefficient blocks. The largest coefficient block is 16 fi 16 while the smallest is 1 fi 1. We form 256 components and compress each component using layered block coding method described in <ref> [5] </ref> to get 256 packets which are then subjected to a 22% random packet loss. The image reconstructed from the survived packets is shown in Fig. 2 (b). No error concealment has been applied to (a) (b) and 22% loss (b). the image. <p> Four different schemes are considered: (P) our proposed scheme in Section 2, (M) MPEG-1, (S) 3D subband coding in which each packet contains one subband and, (T) a scalable compression scheme <ref> [5] </ref> that is similar to scheme (P) except for packetization. Specifically, under scheme (T), the first packet contains the most important information followed by the second packet and so forth. <p> The decoding speeds in the same range varies from 37.9 to 26 frames per second. The reported times exclude disk access and display time <ref> [5] </ref>. On the same machine MPEG encoding proceeds at 0.4 to 1.6 frames per second using exhaustive and logarithmic search respectively.
