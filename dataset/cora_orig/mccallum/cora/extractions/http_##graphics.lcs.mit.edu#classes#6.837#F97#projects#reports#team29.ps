Title: Physics-Based Fluid Model for Haptic Interaction  
Author: Team David DiFranco Luke Fu Peter Ju Thomas Rikert 
Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of a physics-based model of water which can be manipulated in real-time using a haptic device. The model consists of three components: a surface mesh which uses simplified fluid dynamics to create phenonema such as surface tension and wave propagation; a spray model which ejects water droplets from the surface when certain thresholds are exceeded; and a viscous model which accounts for drag forces when an object moves through the water. We have also modeled buoyancy and collision detection for objects floating in the water. By
