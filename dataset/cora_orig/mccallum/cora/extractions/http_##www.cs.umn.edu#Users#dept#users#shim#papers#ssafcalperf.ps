Abstract: The authors would like to thank Dave Archer, Gary Delp, Larry Whitley and Walter Krapohl at IBM Rochester and Horst Truestedt, Edward Clausell, Richard Rolls, Michelle Tidwell and Howard Rankin at IBM Storage System Division for numerous discussions on the details of SSA. We also would like to thank Cort Fergusson, Mike Miller and Jim Coomes at Seagate Technology for providing us valuable information on FC-AL. The trace data used in our study was provided by William Glantz at IBM Rochester. Without their assistance, we have no way to complete our study. January 6, 1997 DRAFT

Reference-contexts: Configuration for SSA Simulation Model. In the SSA simulation model, the interleaving of special characters and the application frames is simulated as specified in the standard draft <ref> [1] </ref>. We assume the initiator is capable of transmitting frames to both output ports and receiving frames from both input ports simultaneously. We also assume that the bandwidth between the interface and the cache is always fast enough to forward the frames from interface buffer to the disk buffer.

Reference-contexts: The disk model is based on an IBM Ultrastar XP 4.51 GB disk. The detailed disk parameters are given in <ref> [9] </ref>. This IBM disk employs zone bit recording [10]. The disk is divided into different zones. The same recording density is used in each zone. Since outer zones are wider in space than inner zones, more data can be stored in outer zones than inner zones.
