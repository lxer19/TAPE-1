Title: Abstract  
Keyword: Key words dynamic branch prediction, two-level branch prediction, PAg, PSg.  
Abstract: Seeking high branchprediction accuracy, architects are making use of the extended history of individual branches. One approach is to divide the branch prediction task into two levels: the first records the results of previous branches; the second makes predictions based upon previous instances in which particular patterns arose. PAg predictors use simple state machines We show that this adaptive level benefits from a high level of hysteresis. We further show that, if the predictions for this second level are fixed rather than adaptive, i.e. a PSg organization, the performance can be superior to that of PAg predictors for short branch histories and close to PAg performance for longer predictors. The patterns of errors among these schemes provide insight into the workings of a wide variety of two-level schemes. in the second level to provide adaptive predictions.

Reference-contexts: The SPECint92 benchmarks, on the other hand, perform limited tasks large numbers of times. It has been shown elsewhere that the SPECint92 benchmarks can be misleading for the design of instruction caches <ref> [Gee93, Uhlig95] </ref>. The degree to which the misprediction rates for SPECint92 benchmarks are dependent upon a given schemes success in handling branches with varied histories may be similarly misleading, since this dependence may exaggerate the differences between schemes.
