Title: GRAPHS, CAUSALITY, AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS

Abstract: Structural equation modeling (SEM) has dominated causal analysis in the social and behavioral sciences since the 1960s. Currently, many SEM practitioners are having difficulty articulating the causal content of SEM and are seeking foundational answers. Recent developments in the areas of graphical models and the logic of causality show potential for alleviating such difficulties and thus for revitalizing structural equations as the primary language of causal modeling. This paper summarizes several of these developments, including the prediction of vanishing partial correlations, model testing, model equivalence, parametric and nonparametric identifiability, control of confounding, and covariate selection. These developments clarify the causal and statistical components of structural equation models and the role of SEM in the empirical sci ences.

Reference-contexts: It is important to emphasize that causal diagrams (as well as traditional path diagrams) should be distinguished from the wide variety of graphical models in the statistical literature whose construction rests solely on properties of the joint distribution <ref> [Wermuth and Cox, 1996; Andersson et al., 1998; Lauritzen, 1997] </ref>. The missing links in those statistical models represent conditional independencies, while the missing links in causal diagrams represent absence of causal connections (see footnote 3 and Section 4) which may or may not imply conditional independencies in the distribution.

In light of these results, the reader might want to know whether the model defined by Eqs. (6)-(8) is identifiable. The answer is yes; this model permits the identification of all interventional queries.

Reference-contexts: A model is semi-Markovian if its graph is acyclic and if it contains dependent errors. Markovian models, (the parallel term in the SEM literature is recursive models 8 <ref> [Bollen, 1989] </ref>), possess useful features, shared by both linear and nonlinear systems, that make their statistical implications transparent. One fundamental property of Markovian models is parent screening: given the state of its parents pa i , each variable X i is conditionally independent of all its nondescendants in the graph. <p> First, the free parameters are estimated by iteratively maximizing a fitness measure such as the maximum likelihood function. Second, the covariance matrix implied by the estimated parameters is compared to the sample co-variances and a statistical test is applied to decide whether the latter could originate from the former <ref> [Bollen, 1989; Chou and Bentler, 1995] </ref>. There are two major weaknesses to this approach: 1. If some parameters are not identifiable, the first phase may fail to reach stable estimates for the parameters and the investigator must simply abandon the test. 2. <p> by two anonymous reviewers. 17 be zero-partial-correlation equivalent and yet not covariance equivalent, criteria based on d-separation can provide merely the necessary conditions for model equivalence. 2.3.2 The significance of equivalent models Theorem 4 is methodologically significant because it clarifies what it means to claim that structural models are "testable" <ref> [Bollen, 1989, p. 78] </ref>. 12 It asserts that we never test a model but, rather a whole class of observationally equivalent models from which the hypothesized model cannot be distinguished by any statistical means. <p> The partial effect will then equal the regression coefficient r XY Z . without having to identify their individual components. Standard SEM methods <ref> [Bollen, 1989; Chou and Bentler, 1995] </ref>, which focus on the identification and estimation of individual parameters, may miss the identification and estimation of effects such as the one in Fig. 9, which can be estimated reliably even though some of the constituents remain unidentified. <p> The other route permits causal reading of only those coefficients that meet the so-called isolation restriction <ref> [Bollen, 1989; James et al., 1982] </ref>, namely, the explanatory variable must be uncorrelated with the error in the equation. Since * cannot be uncorrelated with both X and Y , so the argument goes, fi and 1=fi cannot both have causal meaning, and the paradox dissolves. <p> Finally, our definitions differ from convention by interpreting total and direct effects independently of each other, as outcomes of two different experiments. Textbook definitions (e.g., <ref> [Bollen, 1989, p. 376] </ref>) usually equate the total effect with a power series of path coefficient matrices. This algebraic definition coincides with the operational definition (Definition 7) in recursive (semi-Markovian) systems, but yields erroneous expressions in models with feedback. <p> For instance, given the pair of equations fy = fix + *; x = ffy + ffig, the total effect of X on Y is simply fi, not fi (1 fffi) 1 as stated in <ref> [Bollen, 1989, p. 379] </ref>. <p> In standard linear analysis, an indirect effect may be defined as the difference between the total and the direct effects <ref> [Bollen, 1989] </ref>. In nonlinear analysis, differences lose their significance, and one must isolate the contribution of mediating paths in some other way.

Reference-contexts: These two effects can be identified directly, since there are no back-door paths from Z to either Y or X, giving fffi = r Y Z and fi = r XZ . Thus, ff = r Y Z =r XZ which is familiar to us as the instrumental-variable formula <ref> [Bowden and Turkington, 1984] </ref>. The example shown in Fig. 11 combines all three methods considered thus far.

Reference-contexts: The other route permits causal reading of only those coefficients that meet the so-called isolation restriction <ref> [Bollen, 1989; James et al., 1982] </ref>, namely, the explanatory variable must be uncorrelated with the error in the equation. Since * cannot be uncorrelated with both X and Y , so the argument goes, fi and 1=fi cannot both have causal meaning, and the paradox dissolves.

Reference-contexts: Since we are not interested in identifiability at a point, but rather in identifiability "almost everywhere" <ref> [Koopmans et al., 1950; Simon, 1953] </ref>, we need not compute this determinant. We merely inspect the symbolic form of the determinant's rows to make sure that the equations are nonredundant; each imposes a new constraint on the unlabeled coefficients for at least one value of the labeled coefficients.

Reference-contexts: One wonders, therefore, what has happened to SEM over the past 50 years, and why the basic (and still valid) teachings of Wright, Haavelmo, Marschak, and Koopmans have been forgotten. Some economists attribute the decline in the understanding of structural equations to Lucas' critique <ref> [Lucas Jr., 1976] </ref>, according to which economic agents anticipating policy interventions would tend to act contrary to SEM's predictions which often ignore such anticipations.

Such concerns are answered by the operational interpretation of error terms, Eq. (30), since it prescribes how errors are measured, not how they originate.

Reference-contexts: This statement from one leading social scientist is typical: "It would be very healthy if more researchers abandoned thinking of and using terms such as cause and effect" <ref> [Muthen, 1987, p. 180] </ref>. Perhaps the boldest expression of this tendency was recently voiced by Holland [1995, p. 54]: "I am speaking, of course, about the equation: fy = a + bx + *g. <p> Teachers of SEM generally evade this dilemma via one of two escape routes. One route involves denying that fi has any causal reading and settling for a purely statistical interpretation in which fi measures the reduction in the variance of Y explained by X (e.g., <ref> [Muthen, 1987] </ref>). The other route permits causal reading of only those coefficients that meet the so-called isolation restriction [Bollen, 1989; James et al., 1982], namely, the explanatory variable must be uncorrelated with the error in the equation.

Reference-contexts: representation for the causal relationship "Mud does not cause rain" is distinct from the symbolic representation for "Mud is independent of rain." Oddly, such distinctions have not yet been incorporated into standard scientific analysis. 1 1 A summary of attempts by philosophers to reduce causality to probabilities is given in <ref> [Pearl, 1996, pp. 396-405] </ref>. Two languages for causality have been proposed: path analysis or structural equation modeling (SEM) [Wright, 1921; Haavelmo, 1943], and Neyman-Rubin's potential-response model [Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974]. <p> This translates into a testable claim of invariance: the statistics of Y under condition do (x) should remain invariant to the manipulation of any other variable in the model <ref> [Pearl, 1996; Galles and Pearl 1998] </ref>. 19 This can be written symbolically as P (yjdo (x); do (z)) = P (yjdo (x)) (28) for all Z disjoint of fX [ Y g.

Reference-contexts: Section 3.1 proposes an explanation why the definitions of these two basic concepts have encountered difficulties in econometrics and epidemiology (see also <ref> [Pearl, 1998] </ref>). Pearl [1995] introduces a symbolic calculus for the do () operator, which facilitates the identification of additional causal effects in nonparametric models. Using this calculus, Galles and Pearl [1995] have devised graphical criterion for identifying causal effects in any semi-Markovian model.

Reference-contexts: Since we are not interested in identifiability at a point, but rather in identifiability "almost everywhere" <ref> [Koopmans et al., 1950; Simon, 1953] </ref>, we need not compute this determinant. We merely inspect the symbolic form of the determinant's rows to make sure that the equations are nonredundant; each imposes a new constraint on the unlabeled coefficients for at least one value of the labeled coefficients.

Reference-contexts: With this generalization in mind, we can state necessary conditions for edge replacement: 10 Verma and Pearl [1990] present an example using a nonparametric model, and Richardson has devised an example using linear models with correlated errors <ref> [Spirtes and Richardson, 1996] </ref>. 16 Rule 1: An arrow X - Y is interchangeable with X - Y only if every neighbor or parent of X is inseparable from Y . (By neighbor we mean a node connected (to X) through a bi-directed arc.) Rule 2: An arrow X - Y

Reference-contexts: This feature is used in various discovery algorithms that elicit causal relationships from complex patterns of statistical associations (e.g., <ref> [Pearl and Verma, 1991; Spirtes et al., 1993] </ref>), but discussion of such algorithms lies beyond the scope of this paper. 15 In semi-Markovian models (DAGs with correlated errors), the d-separation criterion is still valid for testing independencies (see Theorem 2) but independence equivalence no longer implies observational equivalence. 10 Two models <p> = y induced by deleting from the model all equations corresponding to variables in X and substituting X = x in the remaining equations. 18 Clearly, the graph corresponding to the reduced set of equations is an edge subgraph of G from which all arrows to X have been pruned <ref> [Spirtes et al., 1993] </ref>. Readers accustomed to thinking of causal effects in terms of randomized experiments may interpret P (yjdo (x)) as the conditional probability P exp (Y = yjX = x) corresponding to a controlled experiment in which X is randomized. <p> In such models, all causal effect queries are identifiable, that is, they can be computed directly from the conditional probabilities P (x i jpa i ), even when the functional forms of the functions f i and the distributions of the disturbances are not specified <ref> [Pearl, 1993c; Spirtes et al., 1993] </ref>. This is seen immediately from the following observations.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the d-separation criterion remains valid in such models if we interpret bi-directed arcs as emanating from latent common parents. This is not always possible in linear semi-Markovian models if each latent variable is restricted to influence at most two observed variables <ref> [Spirtes et al., 1996] </ref>. However, it has been shown that the d-separation criterion remains valid in such restricted systems [Spirtes et al., 1996] and, moreover, that the validity is preserved when the network contains cycles [Koster, 1998; Spirtes et al., 1998]. <p> This is not always possible in linear semi-Markovian models if each latent variable is restricted to influence at most two observed variables <ref> [Spirtes et al., 1996] </ref>.

Consider the graphs G and G ff in Fig. 8.

Reference-contexts: Social scientists, likewise, despite the potential-response analyses of Hol-land and Rubin [1983] and Sobel [1995], are still struggling with various manifestations of the Lord paradox (a version of Simpson's paradox) in psychometric research [Wainer, 1991] and are still not distinguishing collapsibility from nonconfounding <ref> [Steyer et al., 1996] </ref>. In contrast, formulating the covariate selection problem in the language of graphs immediately yields a general solution that is both natural and formal.

Reference-contexts: Epidemiologists, for example, well apprised of ignorability analysis via the admirable papers of Robins [1986] and Greenland and Robins [1986], are still debating the meaning of "confounding" [Grayson, 1987] and often adjust for the wrong sets of covariates <ref> [Weinberg, 1993] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Failure to distinguish among causal assumptions, statistical implications, and policy claims has been one of the main reasons for the suspicion and confusion surrounding quantitative methods in the social sciences <ref> [Freedman, 1987, p. 112; Goldberger, 1992; Wermuth, 1992] </ref>. However, because they make the distinctions among these components vivid and crisp, graphical methods promise to make SEM more acceptable to researchers from a wide variety of disciplines. By and large, the SEM literature has ignored the explicit analysis of equivalent models.

Reference-contexts: Two languages for causality have been proposed: path analysis or structural equation modeling (SEM) <ref> [Wright, 1921; Haavelmo, 1943] </ref>, and Neyman-Rubin's potential-response model [Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974]. The former has been adopted by economists and social scientists [Goldberger, 1972; Duncan, 1975], while a small group of statisticians champion the latter [Rubin, 1974; Robins, 1986; Holland, 1988]. <p> But first, a brief analysis of the current crisis in SEM research in light of its historical development. 1.2 Causality and Structural Models SEM was developed by geneticists <ref> [Wright, 1921] </ref> and economists [Haavelmo, 1943; Koop-mans, 1950, 1953] so that qualitative cause-effect information could be combined with statistical data to provide quantitative assessment of cause-effect relationships among variables of interest.
