Title: SMOOTH STABILIZATION IMPLIES COPRIME FACTORIZATION

Abstract: This paper shows that coprime right factorizations exist for the input to state mapping of a continuous time nonlinear system provided that the smooth feedback stabilization problem be solvable for this system. In particular, it follows that feedback linearizable systems admit such factorizations. In order to establish the result a Lyapunov-theoretic definition is proposed for "bounded input bounded output" stability. The main technical fact proved relates the notion of stabilizability studied in the state space nonlinear control literature to a notion of stability under bounded control perturbations analogous to those studied in operator theoretic approaches to systems; it states that smooth stabilization implies smooth input-to-state stabilization.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Constructions of coprime factorizations for nonlinear systems have been obtained of late in the literature ([10], [12], <ref> [8] </ref>). The potential significance of such fraction representations to the theory of nonlinear control has been pointed out, for instance, in [31], [11], and [9]. Such factorizations are of interest in principle when studying the problem of parameterizing compensator laws. <p> Such factorizations are of interest in principle when studying the problem of parameterizing compensator laws. It has also been pointed out that, in general, factorizations for systems can be obtained through a judicious use of stabilizing feedback controllers (see [18] for the case of linear systems, and [11] and <ref> [8] </ref> for the nonlinear case.) The paper [8] shows that one may always obtain such factorizations for the input to state maps of certain types of continuous time systems of a rather special form, namely those expressible as bounded and input-independent perturbations of controllable linear systems. <p> It has also been pointed out that, in general, factorizations for systems can be obtained through a judicious use of stabilizing feedback controllers (see [18] for the case of linear systems, and [11] and <ref> [8] </ref> for the nonlinear case.)

These definitions refine those that had been typically used in operator theoretic approaches to nonlinear systems analysis (see e.g. [31], <ref> [8] </ref>) and which were motivated by analogous linear concepts. Our definitions are more natural in the context of Lyapunov stability, and they may be relevant as well in areas other than the application to factorization problems. 1 Research supported in part by US Air Force Grants 85-0247 and 88-0235. <p> The reason for such interest is described in detail in [3] and to some extent in [26]. The results given here extend with basically no change to such more general notions. Also, note that reference <ref> [8] </ref> allows for time-varying systems. For simplicity, here we only talk about the time invariant case. The case of systems that are not necessarily linear in controls needs further study. However as far as Theorem 1 is concerned, an analogue is easily obtained. <p> We chose the strongest concept under which we can prove a positive result; for the application to coprime factorizations using the "S-stability" notion in <ref> [8] </ref>, a weaker concept would be sufficient. We believe that the definition given below will be of some importance in future stability studies. We make the following convention regarding norms: for any vector ~ in Euclidean space, j~j is its Euclidean norm. <p> Applied in particular to each pair with T = 0, the definition implies that kF (u)k fl (kuk) for all u. This definition of IOS seems to be natural from a Lyapunov theoretic point of view. It implies other notions such as that of "S-stability" given in <ref> [8] </ref>. The latter is the property that for each a &gt; 0 there should exist a b &gt; 0 such that if kuk a then kF (u)k b. If F is IOS, we can simply take b := fl (a), so S-stability holds too.

Reference-contexts: In fact, we shall give a general result which relates the existence of factorizations to the solution of smooth feedback stabilization problem (s). For variants of the latter see for instance [17], [29], [26], [27], [3], [6], [7], [2], [22], [1], [2], [30], [15], <ref> [28] </ref>, and related references. To be precise, we base the existence of factorizations on the solution of the following control problem.

To be precise, we base the existence of factorizations on the solution of the following control problem. <p> The fact that the system enlarged by an integrator is again smoothly stabilizable is a result which can be found for instance in <ref> [30] </ref>, and is related to ideas of generalized PD control for mechanical systems as in [19]. Finally, we wish to point out that the methods described here are currently being extended to deal with the true BIBO problem in which there is an output map involved.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Constructions of coprime factorizations for nonlinear systems have been obtained of late in the literature ([10], [12], [8]). The potential significance of such fraction representations to the theory of nonlinear control has been pointed out, for instance, in <ref> [31] </ref>, [11], and [9]. Such factorizations are of interest in principle when studying the problem of parameterizing compensator laws. <p> In order to develop the necessary techniques, we must also provide what we believe are original definitions of input/output stability. These definitions refine those that had been typically used in operator theoretic approaches to nonlinear systems analysis (see e.g. <ref> [31] </ref>, [8]) and which were motivated by analogous linear concepts. Our definitions are more natural in the context of Lyapunov stability, and they may be relevant as well in areas other than the application to factorization problems. 1 Research supported in part by US Air Force Grants 85-0247 and 88-0235.

Reference-contexts: By time invariance, an estimate as (38) results. For nonlinear systems (or for linear infinite dimensional systems,) similar such notions of "well-posed observability" has been studied under various names such as "algebraic observability" or "topological observability" (see for instance [25], <ref> [32] </ref>, [4]). Analogously, we define a notion of a strongly reachable system (3) as follows.
