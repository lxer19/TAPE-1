Abstract: My thesis work involves developing structural performance models for parallel distributed applications. I have extended this work to allow for stochastic input parameters, that is, values for system and application characteristics that have a range and a distribution associated with them. In addition, I am interested in showing how such models can be used to achieve performance-efficient schedules. This work is a part of a coordinated Application-Level Scheduling project (AppLeS) in which we are studying application-specific scheduling techniques.
