Abstract: The block cipher DESX is defined by DESX k:k1:k2 (x) = k2 DES k (k1 x), where denotes bitwise exclusive-or. This construction was first suggested by Ron Rivest as a computationally-cheap way to protect DES against exhaustive key-search attacks. This paper proves, in a formal model, that the DESX construction is sound. We show that, when F is an idealized block cipher, FX k:k1:k2 (x) = k2 F k (k1 x) is substantially more resistant to key search than is F . In fact, our analysis says that FX has an effective key length of at least + n 1 lg m bits, where is the key length of F , n is the block length, and m bounds the number of hx; FX K (x)i pairs the adversary can obtain.

Reference-contexts: Many authors have suggested methods to increase the strength of DES by changing its internal structure. Biham and Biryukov <ref> [1] </ref> give ways to modify DES to use key-dependent S-boxes. Their suggestions improve the cipher's strength against differential, linear, and improved Davies' attacks, as well as exhaustive key search.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts with the sort of machines which have been suggested in the past for doing brute-force attack: they do treat the underlying cipher as a black-box transformation. We note that while remarkable theoretical progress has been made on the linear and differential cryptanalysis of DES (see <ref> [2, 10] </ref>), thus far these attacks require an impractically large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

We emphasize that the DESX construction was never intended to add strength against differential or linear cryptanalysis. The attacks of <ref> [2, 10] </ref> do not represent a threat against DES when the cipher is prudently employed (e.g., when a re-key is forced before an inordinate amount of text has been acted on), so we were content that the DESX construction does not render differential or linear attack any easier.

Reference-contexts: To motivate our attack, we can view the FX block cipher as choosing a random key k and then applying the Even-Mansour construction to the function F k . We can therefore adapt Daemen's chosen plaintext attack <ref> [5] </ref> on the Even-Mansour construction [7]. Unfortunately, we don't know the value of k, so we instead try all possible ones.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The susceptibility of DES to exhaustive key search has been a concern and a complaint since the cipher was first made public; see, for example, <ref> [6] </ref>. Careful analysis by Wiener [15] indicates that the problem has now escalated to the point that for $1 million one could build a DES key search engine which, given a hplaintext, ciphertexti pair, would recover the key in about 3.5 expected hours.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, "good" adversaries may, necessarily, use an amount of time, T , which far exceeds their number of F /F 1 queries, t. So focusing on the query complexity makes our results all the more meaningful. 1.3 Related work Even and Mansour <ref> [7] </ref> construct a block cipher PX : f0; 1g 2n fi f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g n from a random permutation P : f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g n by PX k1:k2 (x) = k2 P (k1 x). <p> Chosen-ciphertext attack. The definition we used models a chosen-plaintext attack. One could easily allow, as <ref> [7] </ref> did, a chosen-ciphertext attack: simply provide A an oracle for FX 1 (), in addition to her oracle for FX (). In that case m would count the sum of the number of queries to the FX and FX 1 oracles, and Theorem 3 would continue to hold. <p> To motivate our attack, we can view the FX block cipher as choosing a random key k and then applying the Even-Mansour construction to the function F k . We can therefore adapt Daemen's chosen plaintext attack [5] on the Even-Mansour construction <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, we don't know the value of k, so we instead try all possible ones.

Reference-contexts: If they pass this test, the attack returns the candidate k 0 :k1 0 :k2 0 and halts. 5.3 Analysis of the attack Due to space limitations, we omit an analysis.

The model we have used to upper bound the worth of key-search applies to many other block-cipher based constructions.

Reference-contexts: It seems to be quite secure, but efficiency considerations make triple DES a rather painful way to solve the exhaustive key-search problem. This paper analyses a much cheaper alternative. We recall an elegant suggestion of Ron Rivest <ref> [11] </ref>. He proposes an extension of DES, called DESX, defined in the following simple manner: DESX k:k1:k2 (x) = k2 DES k (k1 x): The key K = k:k1:k2 (here : denotes concatenation) is now 56 + 64 + 64 = 184 bits. <p> The modeling of a block cipher by a family of random permutations has its roots in [13]. Ron Rivest had invented DESX by May of 1984, but the scheme was never described in any conference or journal paper <ref> [11] </ref>. It was implemented within products of RSA Data Security, Inc., and it is described in the documentation for these products [12]. DESX has also been described at conferences organized by RSA DSI, including [16]. Encryption methods similar to DESX have been invented independently.

Reference-contexts: Key-search strategies can be quite sophisticated; recent work by <ref> [14] </ref> is an example. We want a model generous enough to permit sophisticated key-search strategies, but restricted enough to permit only strategies which should be regarded as key search. We accomplish this as follows. Let be the key length for a block cipher and let n be its block length.
