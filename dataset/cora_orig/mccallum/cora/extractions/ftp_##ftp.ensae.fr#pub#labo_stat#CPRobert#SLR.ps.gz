Title: THE SIMULATED LIKELIHOOD RATIO (SLR) METHOD  
Author: M. BILLIO A. MONFORT C.P. ROBERT 
Date: March 1998  
Abstract: Resume. Une methode de simulation fondee sur des techniques d'echantil-lonage d'importance, de Gibbs et Metropolis-Hastings permet d'approcher le rapport de la vraisemblance en deux valeurs du parametre, et donc l'estimateur du maximum de vraisemblance, dans le cadre general des mod-eles dynamiques avec variables latentes. Cette classe contient comme cas particuliers les modeles a facteurs, les modeles a changements de regimes, les modeles a variable dependante limitee dynamiques, les modeles a volatilite stochastique et les modeles en temps continu discretises. Abstract. A simulation method based on importance sampling, Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings techniques allows to approximate the ratio between the likelihood function computed for two different parameter values. Thus it is possible to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator in the general framework of dynamic latent variable models. Some examples of this class of models are factor models, switching regime models, dynamic limited dependent variable models, stochastic volatility models and discretised continuous time models.

Reference-contexts: A second approach considers the problem of the computation (or of the approximation) of the maximum likelihood estimator through importance sampling methods (Daniels-son and Richard [6], Lee [32], Billio and Monfort <ref> [3] </ref>) or Simulated EM (Shephard [44], [45], Diebolt and Ip [8]).

Several proposals are made, including Sequential Op timal Sampling distributions proposed in Billio and Monfort <ref> [3] </ref>. Finally the likelihood ratio thus obtained is maximized, providing approximation of asymptotically efficient estimators and, if desired, of likelihood ratio test statistics.

We first consider the simplest case where the global Markovian property is lost and then Hamilton's algorithm does not apply, i.e. the switching MA (1) model.
