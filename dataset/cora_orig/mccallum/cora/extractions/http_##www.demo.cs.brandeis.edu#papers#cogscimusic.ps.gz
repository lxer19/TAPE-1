Title: REDUCED MEMORY REPRESENTATIONS FOR MUSIC

Abstract: We address the problem of musical variation (identification of different musical sequences as variations) and its implications for mental representations of music. According to reductionist theories, listeners judge the structural importance of musical events while forming mental representations. These judgments may result from the production of reduced memory representations that retain only the musical gist. In a study of improvised music performance, pianists produced variations on melodies. Analyses of the musical events retained across variations provided support for the reductionist account of structural importance. A neural network trained to produce reduced memory representations for the same melodies represented structurally important events more efficiently than others. Agreement among the musicians' improvisations, the network model, and music-theoretic predictions suggest that perceived constancy across musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist mechanism for producing memory representations.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the numeric vectors produced by the network potentially contain as much information as the cognitive structures proposed by rule-formation theorists. Because the reduced descriptions are represented as neural vectors, they are suitable for use with association, categorization, pattern-recognition and other neural-style processing mechanisms <ref> (Chrisman, 1991) </ref>. Such processing mechanisms could, for example, be trained to perform sequence extrapolation tasks (Simon & Sumner, 1968). In the next section we address issues of empirical validation.

Reference-contexts: The solution for musical variation offered by reductionist theories requires the representation of constituent structure, however, and connectionist models have been notoriously weak at representing constituent relationships such as those in language and music <ref> (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988) </ref>. In fact, the lack of useful compositional representations has been an important stumbling block in the application of neural networks and other pattern-recognition techniques to the problems of cognitive science in general.

Reference-contexts: Jones (1981) argues that listeners abstract and store ideal prototypes of musical styles, that lead to musical expectations. Unexpected events in music create interest, but are more difficult to recall <ref> (Jones, Boltz, & Kidd, 1982) </ref>. However, little work has addressed the mechanisms by which listeners may learn the musical regularities or prototypes that are necessary for the identification of the underlying structure of specific musical sequences.

The tunes comprised eighteen unique melodies; five of these eighteen melodies had variations in the training set. <p> These extra dimensions of representation were set to 0.5 on input, and trained as don't-cares <ref> (Jordan, 1986) </ref> on output. As described above, the two RAAM modules each required four input buffers, and each resulting module had 140 input units, 35 hidden units, and 148 output units.

Reference-contexts: The experiment reported here is based on a paradigm described earlier <ref> (Large, Palmer, & Pollack, 1991) </ref>. In this paradigm, musicians are presented with notated melodies and are asked to improvise (create and perform) simple variations on them. <p> The primary objective of this study was to extend earlier findings <ref> (Large, Palmer, & Pollack, 1991) </ref> that suggested that a musician's improvisations on a tune indicated an underlying reduced representation of the melody. <p> This representation nominally captures octave equivalence and pitch height but makes no further assumptions regarding the psychophysical components of pitch, as other connectionist researchers have done (cf. Mozer, 1991). More sophisticated encoding strategies may prove useful for certain musical applications <ref> (cf. Large, Palmer, & Pollack, 1991) </ref>, but for the purposes of this study we sought to minimize inductive biases that would be introduced by more complex coding schemes. Two modifications to the RAAM architecture are necessary to encode Western tonal melodies such as those in our training set. <p> However, the 25 training melodies used in this study contain constituent structure hierarchies 6-7 levels deep, which expand to more than 1000 individual training patterns. Previous experiments found that this training set size outstrips the capacity of a RAAM network that contains a reasonably small number of hidden units <ref> (Large, Palmer, & Pollack, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, the improvised performances do show general agreement with the theoretical predictions of time-span reduction. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that the musical factors incorporated in the reductionist theory <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref> can account for the structure of performers' mental representations for musical improvisations. <p> take advantage of this information about temporal structure to preserve musical regularities that are systematically related to this structure? Our prediction is that the network's reduced descriptions will differentially weight constituent events, and furthermore, that this differential weighting will agree with both the improvisation measures and 16 the theoretical predictions <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref> regarding the relative importance of events. This prediction is based on the observation that RAAM networks learn a data compression algorithm that is tailored to the statistical regularities of a training set. <p> As discussed above, we will use the time-span segmentation, a nested constituent description that captures aspects of the sequence's rhythmic structure <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. In the simple melodies used in this study, the time-spans at smaller constituent levels (less than a measure) were regular (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983); that is, they were aligned with the locations of strong metrical beats. <p> As discussed above, we will use the time-span segmentation, a nested constituent description that captures aspects of the sequence's rhythmic structure <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. In the simple melodies used in this study, the time-spans at smaller constituent levels (less than a measure) were regular (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983); that is, they were aligned with the locations of strong metrical beats. Therefore, the lower levels of time-span segmentation were determined by the metrical structure. Grouping rules (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) contributed to determine time-span segments at constituent levels larger than the single measure. <p> the simple melodies used in this study, the time-spans at smaller constituent levels (less than a measure) were regular <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>; that is, they were aligned with the locations of strong metrical beats. Therefore, the lower levels of time-span segmentation were determined by the metrical structure. Grouping rules (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) contributed to determine time-span segments at constituent levels larger than the single measure. Each encoding produced by the network is the representation of a time-span (and its events) at some level in the time-span segmentation. <p> Our assumption is based on the theory that the constituent structures most relevant to music cognition are closely related to rhythmic structure <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. In this section we briey discuss the relationship between rhythmic structure and constituent structure in music, and its relationship to general issues of constituent structure in temporal sequence processing. Typically, listeners are provided with many cues or markers to rhythmic structure in music. <p> Thus, the perception of metrical and grouping structure may not have to rely heavily on factors such as learned knowledge of melodic regularities. The perception of these forms of rhythmic organization combine to form the basis for the time-span segmentation <ref> (Lerdahl and Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>, the constituent structure that we have assumed as input to our model. Our network made use of this input information to produce representations that captured two kinds of musical structure. First, the network represented the time-span segmentation of the musical sequences. <p> Our assumption that constituent structure would be available as input to a memory process may be too strong. Previously learned patterns, such as cadences, can also inuence listeners' perception of constituent structure <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. It seems likely that the perceptual processes responsible for segmenting a musical sequence into constituents and the representational processes responsible for encoding and/or recognizing constituents must interact. <p> Although this buffer design is sufficient for handling simple melodies, a more complex buffer design would probably be necessary for melodies in which metrical structure and grouping structure may be misaligned or out of phase <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. Recurrent network architectures might be altered to exploit temporal information without necessarily entailing the restrictive design constraints of the RAAM architecture. 5 Conclusions The phenomenon of musical variation can be explained by positing mechanisms that compute memory reductions.

Reference-contexts: One unit means 'up' from the previous event, the other means 'down', and turning both units off means no contour change.

Mozer, 1991) </ref>. More sophisticated encoding strategies may prove useful for certain musical applications (cf. Large, Palmer, & Pollack, 1991), but for the purposes of this study we sought to minimize inductive biases that would be introduced by more complex coding schemes.

Reference-contexts: One proposal is to build recurrent networks with hidden units that have various different constants of temporal integration. This allows the network to retain memory of past events more efficiently, and has resulted in networks with improved sensitivity to global structure <ref> (Mozer, 1992) </ref>. Another proposal is to train hierarchically cascaded recurrent networks to explicitly extract and represent constituent structure (Todd, 1991). Neither of these proposals, however, (explicitly) uses temporal structure information to develop an emergent sensitivity to the relative importance of musical events, as our model does.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we address each of these three challenges posed for reductionist theories. We propose a mechanism that is capable of producing reduced memory representations for music, based on sequences that are first parsed into constituent data structures. We then model the reduced descriptions using recursive distributed representations <ref> (Pollack, 1988, 1990) </ref>, a connectionist formalism that allows us to represent symbolic data structures as patterns of activation in connectionist networks. We also describe an empirical study in which we collect and analyze musicians' improvised variations on three melodies. <p> Elman, 1991). Another possibility for further work concerns the choice of neural network architecture. One of the constraints of the RAAM architecture is the requirement of an external stack control mechanism for handling intermediate results during encoding and decoding <ref> (Pollack, 1988, 1990) </ref>. In addition, the model requires a fixed-structure input buffer to make use of relevant temporal information.

Reference-contexts: This knowledge is captured as a set of weights that the network extracts directly from a training environment (the corpus of melodies), thereby accounting for learning. The network experiment has two goals. The first is to measure the performance of the RAAM network using a well-formedness test <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>. For a given input melody, the compressor network creates a reduced description. The reconstructor network is then applied to the reduced description to retrieve its constituents. <p> of simple Western tonal melodies, the network should be able to make use of this information, and we should see significant levels of agreement among network, theoretical, and empirical measures. 3.1 Network Implementation The RAAM architecture uses a connectionist substrate of fully-connected feed-forward neural networks to produce recursive distributed representations <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>. For example, to encode binary trees with k-bit patterns as the terminal nodes, the RAAM compressor would be a single-layer network with 2 k-unit input buffers and one k-unit output buffer. <p> This form of training, however, violates one of the original design decisions of RAAM: that the terminals be recognizable as binary strings so that it is clear when to terminate the decoding process <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>. We address this problem by adding an extra unit to each RAAM module, that is trained as a terminal detector. <p> One method is to directly examine the representation vectors to determine the function of individual hidden units. Little information can be retrieved from recursive distributed representations of this size, however, because of their complexity <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>. As an alternative approach, the certainty with which the network reconstructed each event of the original sequence was measured by computing the distance between the desired ( ) and obtained ( ) vector representations at each sequence location ( ).

Reference-contexts: how the musical knowledge necessary for the production of reduced descriptions is acquired. 7 One approach that offers a solution to these problems is the application of connectionist models, which learn internal representations in response to the statistical regularities of a training environment using general-purpose learning algorithms such as back-propagation <ref> (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) </ref>. The solution for musical variation offered by reductionist theories requires the representation of constituent structure, however, and connectionist models have been notoriously weak at representing constituent relationships such as those in language and music (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988).

Reference-contexts: Although this paradigm does not provide measures of importance for individual musical events, it does allow the assessment of reductionist claims within an ecologically valid task. The similarity judgements among melodies corresponded to the degree of relatedness predicted by a reductionist theory <ref> (Schenker, 1979) </ref>, even when radical surface differences existed (such as in the musical harmony). This agreement increased with repeated hearings, indicating a significant role of learning in determining the structure of listeners' mental representations (Serafine, Glassman, and Overbeeke, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Earlier studies have examined the role of relative importance in perceptual phenomena such as judgements of musical completion and stability (Palmer & Krumhansl, 1987a; 1987b), and judgements of similarity <ref> (Serafine, Glassman, & Overbeeke,1989) </ref>. However, little research has investigated the role of structural importance in musical performance tasks such as improvisation, in which performers are required to create musical variations.

Reference-contexts: Because the reduced descriptions are represented as neural vectors, they are suitable for use with association, categorization, pattern-recognition and other neural-style processing mechanisms (Chrisman, 1991). Such processing mechanisms could, for example, be trained to perform sequence extrapolation tasks <ref> (Simon & Sumner, 1968) </ref>. In the next section we address issues of empirical validation. Do humans weight melodic events in terms of relative importance? Can reductionist accounts explain the phenomenon of invariant identification across musical variation? We describe an empirical study of variations on melodies improvised by skilled pianists.

Reference-contexts: Second, recurrent networks are capable in principle of capturing 29 arbitrary sequential and/or temporal relationships, including metrical structure, grouping structure, and even time-span reduction. Third, recurrent neural networks provide natural models of musical expectations for future events <ref> (Bharucha & Todd, 1991) </ref>. Finally, recurrent networks can be used for musical composition. By connecting a network's output units to its input units, novel sequences are generated that reveal what has been learned about musical structure (Todd, 1991; Mozer 1991). <p> This allows the network to retain memory of past events more efficiently, and has resulted in networks with improved sensitivity to global structure (Mozer, 1992). Another proposal is to train hierarchically cascaded recurrent networks to explicitly extract and represent constituent structure <ref> (Todd, 1991) </ref>. Neither of these proposals, however, (explicitly) uses temporal structure information to develop an emergent sensitivity to the relative importance of musical events, as our model does. In principle, recurrent networks can represent any temporal relationships (e.g., metrical structure).
