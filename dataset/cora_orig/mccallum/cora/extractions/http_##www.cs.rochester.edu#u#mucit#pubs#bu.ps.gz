Abstract: We use a simple and illustrative example to expose some of the main ideas of Evidential Probability. Specifically, we show how the use of an acceptance rule naturally leads to the use of intervals to represent probabilities, how change of opinion due to experience can be facilitated, and how probabilities concerning compound experiments or events can be computed given the proper knowledge of the underlying distributions.
