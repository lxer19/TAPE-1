Reference-contexts: Notice that the Field category inherits its properties from the Ring category. The set of algebraic categories defines a hierarchy of such inheritance with each child requiring more properties to satisfy for its members <ref> [1] </ref>. The hierarchy that results is a directed acyclic graph. Figure 1 shows a small example. The members of categories|those things that have all the required properties of the categories|are called domains and they correspond to the familiar domains of computation, e.g. integers, reals, etc.

Reference-contexts: This strategy of focusing on a particular node of interest and having its neighbors recede in prominence creates an effect not unlike that of the work done in information visualization with fisheye perspectives <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. However, it should be pointed out that this approach is, in fact, very different. The cited papers proposed altering the projected image so as to skew the perspective bringing some nodes forward and making other nodes recede. <p> Rather than create three dimensional models, another approach is to use the technology from the mathematics of projective geometry necessary in three dimensional graphics. Ideas based upon the distortion of fisheye lenses have been investigated as ways of focusing on various interesting parts of a given data set <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. But, because they only work in image space, the data itself cannot be manipulated as a three dimensional object that allows the user to gain an intuition for the relationships as they exist spatially.

Reference-contexts: The works of Piaget in the area of object permanence claims the existence of a mental grasp of an object as an entity, even if the object is not in its original view or in full view <ref> [3] </ref>. Such notions strongly support the observation that things constrained to a plane, even a free floating plane in three-space, are conducive to being grouped mentally, as sharing something in common|e.g. that they are related to each other under one relationship.

Reference-contexts: If an intuitive counterpart can be found for an abstraction, the application of three dimensional graphics can be a much easier problem. The success of the 2D desk top metaphor, for example, has led to the development of the 3D office metaphor <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. Generalizing from a two dimensional abstract model to a three dimensional abstract model, the cone tree [6] takes the traditional triangular structure of the typical two dimensional tree and realizes it as a conical three dimensional tree structure.

Reference-contexts: An application of the scaling transformation is to convey a continuously changing scalar value that is hard to capture using traditional approaches of varying colors or using different shapes. This is examined below. Flowview, part of the FIELD program visualization system <ref> [5] </ref>, is used to visualize the flow of control of a program. Constrained to a two dimensional environment, it runs into some problems when handling recursive functions. Consider two mutually recursive functions, A and B.

Generalizing from a two dimensional abstract model to a three dimensional abstract model, the cone tree <ref> [6] </ref> takes the traditional triangular structure of the typical two dimensional tree and realizes it as a conical three dimensional tree structure. The extension into the third dimension, however, is treated symmetrically to the other two dimensions.

Reference-contexts: The limitations of restricting the graph to convey only one relationship is not addressed|only the quantity of data over that relationship is increased. The perspective wall <ref> [8] </ref> is a creative use of the third dimension in an asymmetrical fashion. However, unlike the orthogonal system where interactivity is desirable but not required, this system relies heavily upon real-time animation capabilities to convey the information gained by the third dimension.
