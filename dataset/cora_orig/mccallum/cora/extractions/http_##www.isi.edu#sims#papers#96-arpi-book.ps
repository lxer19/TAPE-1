Abstract: A critical problem in building an information mediator is how to translate a domain-level query into an efficient query plan for accessing the required data. We have built a flexible and efficient information mediator, called SIMS. This system takes a domain-level query and dynamically selects the appropriate information sources based on their content and availability, generates a query access plan that specifies the operations and their order for processing the data, and then performs semantic query optimization to minimize the overall execution time. This paper describes these three basic components of the query processing in

Reference-contexts: Information sources are constantly changing, new information becomes available, old information may be eliminated or temporarily unavailable, and so on. Thus, SIMS dynamically selects fl This is an updated version of the paper that originally appeared as <ref> [Arens et al., 1994] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if the user requests all seaports, that information can be retrieved from the GEO database, which has information about seaports. 3 Information Source Selection The first step in answering a query expressed in the terms of the domain model is to select the appropriate information sources <ref> [ Arens et al., 1996 ] </ref> . This is done by trans Domain Model forming a query expressed in terms of the concepts in the domain model into a query expressed in terms of the concepts in the information source models.

Reference-contexts: This simplifies the input/output since there is no conversion between languages. The planner [ Knoblock, 1994; 1995; 1996 ] is implemented in a version of UCPOP <ref> [ Penberthy and Weld, 1992; Barrett et al., 1993 ] </ref> that has been modified to generate parallel execution plans. The system searches through the space of possible plans using a best-first search until a complete plan is found.
