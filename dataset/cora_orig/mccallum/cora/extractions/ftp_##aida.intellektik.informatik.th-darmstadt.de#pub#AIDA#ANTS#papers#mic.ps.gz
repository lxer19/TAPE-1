Abstract: In this paper we present an extension of MAX MIN Ant System applying it to Traveling Salesman Problems and Quadratic Assignment Problems. The extension involves the use of a modified choice rule and a hybrid scheme allowing ants to improve their solution by local search. The computational results show that this algorithm can be used to efficiently find near optimal solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems and is one of the best methods for the solution of structured quadratic assignment problems.

Reference-contexts: As a simple local search procedure for symmetric TSPs we implemented the so called 2-opt algorithm and a version in which also moves corresponding to node insertions are made, denoted as 2-h-opt <ref> [2, 31] </ref>. For ATSP the 2-opt heuristic is not directly applicable as in a 2-opt move one part of the tour is inverted. So we use a particular 3-opt move that allows the re-insertion of arcs without reversing the direction of any partial tour, called reduced 3-opt. <p> is run on larger problems we restricted the number of 2-opt moves to the 40 nearest neighbors Sophia-Antipolis, France, July 21-24, 1997 INRIA & PRiSM-Versailles 6 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON METAHEURISTICS - MIC97 [21] and search for an improving move via a fixed radius near neighbor search, as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Another improvement concerns the update of the trail matrix. In Ant System and MMAS the trail matrix has n 2 entries, thus, the update according to Equation 1.2 would require time O (n 2 ). <p> For ACS we used the parameter settings given in [9]. 5 The experiments were run using the measurement 5 In [9] a 3-opt local search algorithm is used, giving better results than reduced 2-h-opt. In the meanwhile we also implemented a fast 3-opt procedure using don't look bits <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Their approach is in the same spirit as our application of MMAS to QAPs as they adapt their successful genetic algorithm for the TSP to the QAP using only minor modifications. A new feature they present is a very fast local search procedures inspired by don't look bits <ref> [2] </ref>. Especially for larger problems they obtain very good results with comparably low computation times. Another new approach is based on Scatter Search and uses Tabu Searches as the local search operators [7].

Reference-contexts: Thus, to find solutions of very high quality some hybrid method is needed. An often used idea is INRIA & PRiSM-Versailles Sophia-Antipolis, France, July 21-24, 1997 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON METAHEURISTICS - MIC97 5 to combine a probabilistic, adaptive construction heuristic with local search heuristics <ref> [4, 12] </ref>, where the construction heuristic provides good starting points for the local search. MAX MIN Ant System is such an adaptive construction heuristic. <p> Another important issue is to identify the problem classes which can be efficiently solved using ACO approaches. For many problems it has been shown that their search space provides a structure in the way that locally optimal solutions are clustered in a small part of the search space <ref> [4] </ref>. It is on problems exhibiting such a kind of behavior, that current Ant Colony Optimization approaches work specifically well. Thus, we conjecture that current ACO approaches will proof particularly competitive on structured problem domains.

Reference-contexts: Since the work on Ant System, several extensions of the basic algorithm have been proposed, among those are Ant-Q [14], Ant Colony System [15], MAX MIN Ant System [32, 34] and the rank-based version of Ant System <ref> [5] </ref>. All these extensions are in some sense "greedier" than Ant System, but differ significantly in main aspects of the search control.

Reference-contexts: MMAS is a general purpose algorithm that can be applied with minor modifications to combinatorial optimization problems yielding high quality solutions competitive with the best algorithms for both, TSPs and QAPs. The computational results presented on symmetric and asymmetric TSP instances from TSPLIB [30] and QAP instances of QAPLIB <ref> [6] </ref> support this claim. The paper is organized as follows: To make the paper self contained, we briefly introduce MMAS and its application to TSPs in Section 2. Subsequently, in Section 3, we describe how MMAS is applied in combination with local search procedures to TSPs. <p> In case local search is allowed, the heuristic information is replaced by the information, which arcs are contained in the local optimal solutions, making the heuristic information of less use. 5.3 Quadratic Assignment Problems In this section we present results obtained on some problem instances of QAPLIB <ref> [6] </ref>. As noted in [35], the problem instances may be classified in basically two types: Purely randomly generated problems without structure, for many of these instances the entries of the matrices A and B are uniformly distributed, and more structured real world problems.

Especially for larger problems they obtain very good results with comparably low computation times. Another new approach is based on Scatter Search and uses Tabu Searches as the local search operators <ref> [7] </ref>. They obtain very high quality solutions but apparently at the cost of rather high run times. 7 Conclusion In this paper we have presented an enhancement of MAX MIN Ant System using the pseudo random proportional rule first proposed for Ant-Q and ACS.

Reference-contexts: MAX MIN Ant System [34, 32] yields a significantly better solution quality than Ant System for TSPs if only tour constructions are allowed. Additionally, the performance of ACO approaches can be considerably enhanced by adding a local search phase <ref> [32, 33, 9, 27] </ref>, in which some ants are allowed to improve their solutions by a local search procedure. Thus, we obtain a hybrid algorithm consisting of a construction mechanism and a subsequent local search phase. <p> Ant System and an improved tour quality for longer runs compared to ACS. 2.3 Modifications to MAX MIN Ant System Compared to MMAS as presented in Section 2 we considered the modification of the selection rule for the next city and adopted the pseudo-random-proportional rule used in Ant Colony System <ref> [15, 9] </ref>. Here with some probability p 0 the best possible choice is made, i.e, the ant chooses a city for which t ff ij ij is maximal. Otherwise with probability 1 p 0 the next city is selected according to Equation 1.1. <p> The solution quality of 2-h-opt usually is slightly better than the one obtained with 2-opt. We compare the results of MMAS with those obtained by our own implementation of Ant Colony System (ACS) using the same local search procedure. For ACS we used the parameter settings given in <ref> [9] </ref>. 5 The experiments were run using the measurement 5 In [9] a 3-opt local search algorithm is used, giving better results than reduced 2-h-opt.

Ant System has been introduced using TSP as an example application. Recently, ACS another ant based approach to improve over Ant System was presented <ref> [15, 9] </ref>. With ACS very good results for symmetric TSP and especially for ATSPs with an extension of ACS by a 3-opt procedure are obtained. 8 For TSP another promising approach is the extension to ASPARAGOS presented in [18].

We allow for a total of 250 applications of Tabu Search. For the greedy 2-opt local search a total of 1000 local search applications were allowed, resulting in computation times comparable (or less) to the 250 applications of Tabu Search.

In [29] a genetic local search algorithm for QAPs is presented, extending earlier work of the authors on TSPs.

Reference-contexts: For both TSP and QAP we chose p 0 in such a way that roughly 15 cities or units are chosen according to Equation 1.1, i.e., p 0 = (n 15)=n. In some sense this is similar to the slight modifications made in iterated Lin-Kernighan <ref> [20] </ref> to the current solution: In iterated Lin-Kernighan the current solution is modified by a random 4-opt move that can not be reversed directly by the Lin Kernighan local search procedure. <p> Both approaches are compared to an iterated local search approach. We apply the random 4-opt move used in the iterated Lin-Kernighan algorithm <ref> [20, 21] </ref> to modify the local optimal solution and use 2-h-opt as the local search procedure. For the iterated local search approach we use the same local search as for MMAS and allowed the same computation time as needed by MMAS. <p> We can not discuss all of these approaches but just want to indicate some rather recent work on these two problems. For the TSP the most efficient approaches are the iterated Lin-Kernighan algorithm <ref> [20, 21] </ref> and the Genetic Local Search approach of [29]. Yet, both algorithms use the powerful Lin-Kernighan heuristic | it is regarded as the uncontested champion for TSPs | as the local search operator.

Yet, if one cannot use this sophisticated local search procedure which is much more difficult to implement than e.g. 2-opt or 3-opt, MMAS in its presented form is a viable alternative for the solution of TSPs.

Reference-contexts: MAX MIN Ant System [34, 32] yields a significantly better solution quality than Ant System for TSPs if only tour constructions are allowed. Additionally, the performance of ACO approaches can be considerably enhanced by adding a local search phase <ref> [32, 33, 9, 27] </ref>, in which some ants are allowed to improve their solutions by a local search procedure. Thus, we obtain a hybrid algorithm consisting of a construction mechanism and a subsequent local search phase. <p> Thus, by adding Tabu Search a higher solution quality than by adding a simple greedy 2-opt procedure should be expected. A first application of Ant System to the QAP is presented in <ref> [27] </ref>. Independently from our approach another new Ant Colony Optimization approach has been proposed for QAPs [16]. In Section 5.3 we will compare their results with ours showing that both approaches result in a comparable solution quality.

Reference-contexts: We can not discuss all of these approaches but just want to indicate some rather recent work on these two problems. For the TSP the most efficient approaches are the iterated Lin-Kernighan algorithm [20, 21] and the Genetic Local Search approach of <ref> [29] </ref>. Yet, both algorithms use the powerful Lin-Kernighan heuristic | it is regarded as the uncontested champion for TSPs | as the local search operator. <p> For ATSPs impressive results are reported solving all problems used here to optimality in all runs with computation times of only few seconds. For QAP apart from HAS-QAP [16] two other very promising approaches have been proposed. In <ref> [29] </ref> a genetic local search algorithm for QAPs is presented, extending earlier work of the authors on TSPs. Their approach is in the same spirit as our application of MMAS to QAPs as they adapt their successful genetic algorithm for the TSP to the QAP using only minor modifications.

Reference-contexts: MMAS is a general purpose algorithm that can be applied with minor modifications to combinatorial optimization problems yielding high quality solutions competitive with the best algorithms for both, TSPs and QAPs. The computational results presented on symmetric and asymmetric TSP instances from TSPLIB <ref> [30] </ref> and QAP instances of QAPLIB [6] support this claim. The paper is organized as follows: To make the paper self contained, we briefly introduce MMAS and its application to TSPs in Section 2.

Yet, it has been noted that repeating local searches from randomly generated initial solutions still lets a considerable gap to the optimal solution for most problems. Thus, to find solutions of very high quality some hybrid method is needed. <p> To speed up the tour construction, we use candidate sets <ref> [31] </ref> of size 20 that contain for a given city i a list of the 20 nearest neighbors. If possible, an ant chooses the next city among the members of the candidate set, otherwise it chooses the closest city. <p> As a simple local search procedure for symmetric TSPs we implemented the so called 2-opt algorithm and a version in which also moves corresponding to node insertions are made, denoted as 2-h-opt <ref> [2, 31] </ref>. For ATSP the 2-opt heuristic is not directly applicable as in a 2-opt move one part of the tour is inverted. So we use a particular 3-opt move that allows the re-insertion of arcs without reversing the direction of any partial tour, called reduced 3-opt.

We are convinced that these results also carry over to MMAS and that the solution quality still can be improved by far.
