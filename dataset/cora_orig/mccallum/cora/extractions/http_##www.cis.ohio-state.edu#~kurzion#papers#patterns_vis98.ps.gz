Abstract: We introduce a new approach for mapping texture on volumetric iso-surfaces and parametric surfaces. Our approach maps 2D images on surfaces while maintaining continuity and preserving the size of the mapped images on the models. Our approach is fully automatic. It eliminates the need for manual mapping of texture maps. We use the curvature of a surface at a point in order to continuously vary the scale of the mapped image. This makes our approach dependent only on local attributes of a point (position, normal and its derivatives) and independent of the global shape and topology of an object. Our method can map high resolution images on low resolution volumes, hence enhancing the visual appearance of rendered volume data. We describe a general framework useful for all surface types that have a C 1 continuous normal. We demonstrate the new method for painting volume data and for mapping cavities on volume data.

Reference-contexts: Once we have reconstructed a continuous function from the sampled data, we can find the analytical gradient by simply computing the derivative of the filter weights and applying those new weights for a new reconstruction process as suggested by Bentum et al. <ref> [3] </ref> Hence, in order to guarantee C 1 continuous normals, we require at least a C 2 continuous filter kernel. The most obvious and most commonly used choices such as nearest neighbor interpolation or linear interpolation constitute only C 0 continuity.

Reference-contexts: In both categories, a user has to manually specify the extent and contents of texture maps for each portion of the object. The amount of work required depends on the complexity of the model. Bier and Sloan <ref> [4] </ref> presented a two step method for mapping texture over surfaces. They map the texture on a simple surface first, and then project the texture from the simple surface onto the target model. Their method enables decreasing the amount of size distortion. <p> At each point we intersect the surface normal with a bounding box, and use the intersection point to map into the texture image. We now have a very simple view independent scheme for continuous mapping of images onto smooth surfaces. This scheme is identical to the two-part mapping method <ref> [4] </ref> when picking a box as the intermediate surface, and using the target surface normal for mapping texture. curvature and so we map a wall segment of size P 0 on a segment surface of equal size C 0 .

Reference-contexts: The next section introduces homotopy, and in particular, the two homotopies we use. Section 3 describes the simple case: pattern mapping on parametric surfaces, and Section 4 describes how to apply pattern maps Volume data. 2 HOMOTOPY We use homotopy <ref> [5] </ref> in order to generate a continuous range of pattern images at any given pattern density.

Reference-contexts: Their method enables decreasing the amount of size distortion. However, it does not guarantee size preservation, and it is useful only if the intermediate surface is very simple. Environment mapping <ref> [6] </ref> was introduced as a means for generating a cheap ray-tracing effect. It uses the surface normal at each point in order to lookup its color in a 2D texture map. For each point, the environment mapping algorithm reects the viewing direction about the surface normal.

Unfortunately we found that these filters are not C 2 continuous. Mitchell and Netravali <ref> [12] </ref> introduced a larger group of cubic filters, also known as the BC-splines. In order to find C 2 continuous filters in this group, we required the basis functions of their first and second derivative to match at their endpoints accordingly.

Reference-contexts: We found these error bounds sufficient for our application. Mller et al <ref> [14] </ref> provide further discussion of these filters. Given a 4x4x4 subset of a volume, we evaluate the normals at a point (u, v, w) anywhere in the center 2x2x2 grid as follows: We first use the Intensity filter to reconstruct four values in each major direction X, Y and Z.

Reference-contexts: Figure 9 shows the application of pattern maps on volume data. In order to eliminate volume noise we evaluate the pattern mapping variables out of a blurred and shrunk down version of the drawn volume. 4.3 Cavity Mapping Pederson <ref> [15] </ref> presented a method for generating displacements along ow fields. We observe that the gradient vector direction in a volume is a ow field. Under the C 1 continuous normal filter we can use a 2D intensity image to generate a pattern of cavities in a model.
