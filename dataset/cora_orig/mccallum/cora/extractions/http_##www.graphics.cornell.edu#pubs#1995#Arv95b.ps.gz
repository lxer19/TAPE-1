Title: The Role of Functional Analysis in Global Illumination  
Author: James Arvo

Affiliation: Program of Computer Graphics Cornell University  
Abstract: The problem of global illumination is virtually synonymous with solving the rendering equation. Although a great deal of research has been directed toward Monte Carlo and finite element methods for solving the rendering equation, little is known about the continuous equation beyond the existence and uniqueness of its solution. The continuous problem may be posed in terms of linear operators acting on infinite-dimensional function spaces. Such operators are fundamentally different from their finite-dimensional counterparts, and are properly studied using the methods of functional analysis. This paper summarizes some of the basic concepts of functional analysis and shows how these concepts may be applied to a linear operator formulation of the rendering equation. In particular, operator norms are obtained from thermodynamic principles, and a number of common function spaces are shown to be closed under global illumination. Finally, several fundamental operators that arise in global illumination are shown to be nearly finite-dimensional in that they can be uniformly approximated by matrices.

Reference-contexts: Let X denote a vector space of real-valued surface radiance functions defined on MfiS 2 , where S 2 is the unit sphere. For purposes of analysis, the space X must have additional structure; minimally, it must have a topology, which defines open sets or neighborhoods of functions <ref> [20] </ref>. Here we shall only consider the metric topologies that are an automatic consequence of a norm defined on the space. Infinitely many norms can be defined on the space of radiance functions, each inducing a different topology and each providing a different notion of size, distance, and convergence. <p> Equation (2) shows how one measure may be defined in terms of another. The new measure eliminates the proliferation of cosine factors that appear in radiative 1 This notation differs among authors. Alternatives include d <ref> [20, p. 20] </ref> and (du 0 ) [7, p. 95]. transfer computations, but more importantly, it emphasizes that the cosine is an artifact of surface integration. <p> This observation is vital in defining appropriate norms and inner products for radiance functions. 3.2 The L p Spaces The Lebesgue integral provides a mechanism for defining a family of fundamental function spaces called Lebesgue spaces or L p -spaces <ref> [20, p. 66] </ref>. These spaces are defined in terms of the L p -norms, which for radiance functions are given by jj f jj p M S 2 p 1=p where m denotes area measure over M, and 1 p 1 is a real number 2 . <p> The second equality holds by Fubini's theorem <ref> [20, p. 164] </ref>, which states that the order of integration can be changed when the integral exists and is finite. In the final equality, we have isolated the kernel of the integral operator K to the extent possible.

Reference-contexts: While the simpler concept of the Riemann integral is equivalent when it exists, the Lebesgue integral is more robust with respect to limiting operations, which makes it a valuable tool for defining abstract spaces such as Banach spaces <ref> [21] </ref>. The measure-theoretic notation used in (1) also allows us to introduce the convenient measure that incorporates a cosine weighting. Formally, the measure is defined by (E) E where E S 2 and n (r) is the surface normal at the point r 2 M; thus, implicitly depends on r.

Reference-contexts: But multiplication operators are not compact, and this property is inherited by S. To see how these facts affect the process of global illumination, consider the two-pass solution process proposed by Sillion and Puech <ref> [23] </ref>. We replace equation (15) by f = f 0 + (K + S)Gf , which includes specular reflection, and write it as (I SG)f = f 0 + KGf: Since jj S jj &lt; 1, it follows that b S (I SG) 1 exists.

A compact operator is one that maps bounded sets to compact sets <ref> [25, p. 293] </ref>. Thus, compact operators remove one of the oddities of infinite-dimensional spaces, which frequently simplifies things.
