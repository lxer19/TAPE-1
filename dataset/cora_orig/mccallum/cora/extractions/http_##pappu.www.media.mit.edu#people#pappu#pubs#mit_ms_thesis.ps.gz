Reference-contexts: Another novel concept was the introduction of anastigmatic images and astigmatic horizontal and vertical holograms. A related approach was followed by Fritzler and Marom [25] in their quest to reduce the information content of a holographic image. It must be mentioned that Vanderlugt <ref> [12] </ref> also performed a careful analysis of the spatial frequencies at different planes in the system. He concluded that by using pixels with variable aspect ratios over the hologram plane it was possible to represent near-field holograms with the same number of samples as required for far-field holograms.

Reference-contexts: The premise of this chapter is that if the minimum amount of information is determined, then the next step would be to isolate a class of waveforms that can deliver this amount of information to a beam of light efficiently. Information theory <ref> [28, 29, 30] </ref> is the science that is concerned with two fundamental questions what is the ultimate data compression possible and what is the ultimate transmission rate of a a communication channel? Information theory deals with estimating the information content of mathematical objects, which in our case, are computer-generated holograms. <p> The classical connection between information and resolution [35, 36, 37] emerges naturally from this argument. Another connection to classical information theory is also manifest in Shannons analysis of entropy loss in linear filters <ref> [28] </ref>. In order to test the above theory on real gratings, a few examples [38] are presented below. A piece of clear glass: The transmittance function of a piece of clear glass is unity. It simply lets all the light pass through.

Reference-contexts: In order to determine the KL distance between the input and output plane wave distributions, mathematical objects known in quantum mechanics as density matrices <ref> [31, 32, 33] </ref> have to be introduced. The elements of a density matrix are all possible bilinear products of the coefficients of an expansion in some basis. As an example, consider Eq 3-15, where the input to the grating is represented as an expansion in a plane-wave basis.

Reference-contexts: Then, canonical geometries are presented for the spherical GIRS case and pixel sizes are determined. Cylindrical-optical extensions of the GIRS are presented in section 4.4. The final section discusses the utility of determining the pixel sizes and dynamic range requirements. The GIRS is a simple two-lens relay system <ref> [39] </ref> as shown in Figure 2.1. L1 and L2 are identical spherical lenses which are separated by twice their focal length F. L1 is the objective lens and L2 is the field lens. L1 forms a real image of the three-dimensional scene in space. <p> In this case, the slit height is 0.82 mm, which exactly matches the value derived from Fourier considerations <ref> [39] </ref>. It is clear that the variety of pixel aspect ratios changes considerably when HPO imaging is taken into account. In this section we examine cylindrical optical extensions of the GIRS and determine the pixel aspect ratios. Our motivation for studying the cylindrical case is the following.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter, uniform sampling is assumed. In the following sections, we take a closer look at canonical or prototype uniformly-sampled computed hologram geometries and determine pixel aspect ratios for each case. Canonical geometries refer to either image-plane or viewer-plane hologram configurations <ref> [40] </ref>. As was noted before, there are two degrees of freedom involved: the location of the hologram plane and geometry of the reference beam. In this section, we explore all possible combinations of hologram location and reference beam geometry when spherical lenses are used in the GIRS.
