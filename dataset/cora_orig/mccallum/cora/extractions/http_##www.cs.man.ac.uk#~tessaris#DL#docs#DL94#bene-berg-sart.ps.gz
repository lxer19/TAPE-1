Title: Subsumption for Semantic Query Optimization in OODB  
Author: Domenico Beneventano ffi Sonia Bergamaschi Claudio Sartori ffi CIOC-CNR 
Abstract: The purpose of semantic query optimization is to use semantic knowledge (e.g. integrity constraints) for transforming a query into an equivalent one that may be answered more efficiently than the original version. This paper proposes a general method for semantic query optimization in the framework of OODBs (Object Oriented Database Systems). The method is applicable to the class of conjunctive queries and is based on two ingredients: a description logic able to express both class descriptions and integrity constraints rules (IC rules) as types; sub-sumption computation between types to evaluate the logical implications expressed by IC rules.

(2) A filtering activity (constraint removal) is performed by detecting the elim-inable factors of a query, that is, the factors logically implied by the query. 2 Complex Objects and IC Rules The main extension of the description logic proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> is the generalization of the notion of a database schema as a set of rules which express inclusion statement between general types. <p> Therefore, computing subsumption in a schema R can be performed by firstly determining the semantic expansion of a type and, secondly, by computing subsumption in the subschema R oe <ref> [2] </ref>. Let us give two simple query optimization examples related to schema of table 1.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, we provide the theoretical framework (in term of sub-sumption) for developing a theory of semantic query optimization which includes the main query transformation criteria proposed in the database literature. Inclusion statements between concepts, recently proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> to express a TKRS, constitute a generalization of description logic perspective. This new perspective perfectly fits the usual database viewpoint. In fact, actual database schemata are given in terms of base classes (i.e. primitive concepts); further knowledge is expressed as IC rules.

Semantic optimization will be performed only over the clean part of a given query.

Reference-contexts: Semantic optimization will be performed only over the clean part of a given query. The clean part of a query, in the following referenced as query, corresponds to the so-called conjunctive queries or single operand queries <ref> [12] </ref> in OODBs and is a virtual class (i.e. a defined concept). The chosen strategy for optimization is the following.
