Abstract: When an over-the-cell routing layer is available for standard cell layout, efficient utilization of that routing space over the cells can significantly reduce layout area. In this paper, we present three physical models to utilize the area over the cells for routing in standard cell designs. We also present efficient algorithms to choose and to route a planar subset of nets over the cells so that the resulting channel density is reduced as much as possible. For each of the physical models, we show how to arrange inter-cell routing, over-the-cell routing and power/ground busses to achieve valid routing solutions. Each algorithm exploits the particular arrangement in the corresponding physical model and produces provably good results in polynomial time. We tested our algorithms on two industrial standard cell designs. In these tests, this method reduces total channel density as much as 21%.

Reference-contexts: Conventional channel routing has been extensively studied, and there are several channel routers which can produce solutions using at most one or two tracks more than channel density for most practical problems. (For example, see <ref> [7, 23, 20, 1, 19] </ref>). To further reduce the channel routing area, some channel routers use the extra routing area over the cells for interconnections [9, 15, 21, 14, 3, 5].

Reference-contexts: This is because the two rows of terminals belong to two different channels, and connections for the same net in different channels have been accomplished by adding feedthroughs in the global routing phase (for example, see <ref> [2] </ref>). Therefore, a routing solution S to the TFPR problem can be partitioned into the union of two planar routing solutions S l and S u for the lower and upper rows of terminals.

Algorithm Overview Since the over-the-cell channel routing problem is NP-hard [14], a common approach is to partition the problem into several sub-problems and solve each one separately. Cong and Liu <ref> [5] </ref> proposed one such partition, which worked very well in their symbolic over-the-cell channel routing model. The problem was solved in three stages. The first stage was to route over the cells. <p> Clearly, the problem in this stage is equivalent to the conventional two-layer channel routing problem. Therefore, it can be solved by well-known two-layer channel routers. Fig. 7 shows a symbolic over-the-cell channel routing solution. Because the symbolic model in <ref> [5] </ref> captures the essential issues in over-the-cell routing, we will follow the same three-stage approach in this paper 3 . In fact, the algorithms for the second and third stages can be applied directly to all three physical models described in the preceding section. <p> Each of these algorithms exploits the particular arrangement in the corresponding physical models and produces provably good results in polynomial time. 3.2. Connection Weights to Minimize Channel Density The objective of the first stage in <ref> [5] </ref> is to minimize the number of resulting hyperterminals, or equivalently, to maximize the number of terminals connected over the cells. Although the number of hyperterminals over the cells is related to the resulting channel density, different choices of hyperterminals may result in different channel densities. <p> First, we transform the multi-terminal net OFPR problem into the two-terminal net OFPR problem because we shall see later on in this section that the two-terminal OFPR problem can be solved efficiently using the dynamic programming technique. Our transformation procedure is similar to the one in <ref> [5] </ref> and it shall be explained in the proof of the following theorem: Theorem 1: For any instance I of the multi-terminal net OFPR problem, I can be transformed to an instance I of the two-terminal net OFPR problem in O (n 2 ) time such that I contains O (k <p> Clearly, I thus constructed is an instance the two-terminal net OFPR problem. Furthermore, using an argument similar to the one in the proof of Theorem 1 in <ref> [5] </ref>, we can show that I contains O (k . n ) terminals and that the problem of finding a maximum weighted planar routing in I is equivalent to the one of finding a maximum weighted planar subset in I . ` According to this theorem, we need only concentrate on <p> Output f and p. Fig. 14 Algorithm for computing a flow with the maximum h -bounded gain. completing the over-the-cell routing stage, the net segment selection algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref> was used to determine the terminals to be connected in each channel. After this stage, the resulting density of each channel was computed. The Xerox PARC standard cell family was used for testing the algorithms.

Three Physical Models for Over-the-Cell Routing In the standard cell design style, cells are placed in rows and channels are formed between adjacent cell rows. There are three routing layers: one layer of polysilicon and two layers of metal.

Reference-contexts: In general, an over-the-cell connection between a pair of terminals that spans the densest columns in the channel is more likely to reduce channel density. Therefore, a more accurate objective of the first stage would be based on the density distribution in the channel <ref> [8] </ref>. Let R be the row of terminals of the lower (or upper) side of a channel C . Let a.c denote the terminal of net a at column c . <p> However, for that channel, the feedthrough positions and the information on adjacent channels are no longer available <ref> [8] </ref>. -25- models is around 20%. However, the density reduction in the HDVC model is at most 2%. This is because the cell family at Xerox PARC does not use built-in feedthroughs. As a result, many feedthroughs are introduced in the global routing phase.

Reference-contexts: The objective in the first stage is to minimize the number of resulting hyperterminals. Intuitively, this procedure is equivalent to maximizing the number of connected terminals in the planar routing. The problem thus formulated was reduced to the problem of finding a maximum independent set of a circle graph <ref> [10] </ref>, which can be solved in quadratic time. The second stage was to choose which net segments were to be connected in the channel. A net segment is a set of two terminals of the same net that belong to two different hyperterminals.

Reference-contexts: For each capacity constraint stated in (4.4), we introduce a dual variable g (x , y ). Then, it is easy to derive that the dual problem has the following formulation (see <ref> [11, p.114] </ref>): (4.6) -p (s ) + p (t ) = h , -21- (4.9) g (x , y ) 0, (x , y ) E , (4.10) minimize (x ,y )P (E ) Each dual variable of the form p (x ) is called the node potential of vertex x <p> h -th iteration, we can show that f is a flow with the maximum h - bounded gain and p is the node potential function in an optimal solution to the dual problem defined in (4.6) - (4.10). (The proof of the correctness of the algorithm can be found in <ref> [11, pp.113-127] </ref>.) In summary, Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for computing a flow with the maximum h -bounded gain can be described as in Fig. 14.

Reference-contexts: Note that during each iteration, the most time-consuming step is to compute a maximum flow in the admissible graph H , which can be carried out in O (mn logn 2 /m ) time using an algorithm by Goldberg and Tarjan <ref> [12] </ref>. Therefore, Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for computing a flow with the maximum h -bounded gain has the complexity O (h . mn logn 2 /m ). 5. Experimental Results We tested our algorithms on two circuits from Xerox PARC and on the Physical Design Workshop benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: This problem can be solved by finding a maximum-weighted h -family in a partially ordered set. A partially ordered set P is a collection of elements together with a binary relation defined on P P which satisfies the following conditions <ref> [16] </ref>: (1) reflexive, i.e., x x for all x P . (2) antisymmetric, i.e., x y and y x implies x y . (3) transitive, i.e., x y and y z implies x z . We say that x and y are related if x y or y x .

Reference-contexts: However, in this case, the over-the-cell routing problem becomes a general area planar routing problem (as compared to the one-row or two-row planar routing problems formulated in the next section) and it is computationally difficult to compute an optimal or near-optimal over-the-cell routing solution (see the NP-completeness result in <ref> [17] </ref>). 3.

Reference-contexts: One algorithm uses a dynamic programming method. The other two algorithms compute the maximum-weighted h -family in a partially ordered set. We tested our algorithms on several industrial circuits, including the benchmark Primary1 from the Physical Design Workshop <ref> [18] </ref>. The algorithms reduced the total channel density as much as 21% for the examples in our test suite. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss three physical models for over-the-cell routing in detail. <p> For example, for the 13 rows of cells in the Primary1 circuit <ref> [18] </ref>, the maximum of d (S d ) is 13, and the average of d (S d ) is 8.5. However, for the cell family used at Xerox PARC, the number of available tracks over the cells is 13 (i.e. h = 13). <p> The algorithms were tested on two circuits. One circuit is labeled the Reed-Solomon Decoder (RSD). It has 210 cells and 211 nets. Another circuit is labeled Primary1. It is a benchmark example used in the Physical Design Workshop <ref> [18] </ref>. It is composed of 752 cells and 904 nets. 5 The cells in the RSD are placed in 16 rows. Table 2 shows reduction of channel densities in the RSD for each of the over-the-cell routing models. The cells in Primary1 are placed in 14 rows.
