Abstract: The FAMA-NCS protocol is introduced for wireless LANs and ad-hoc networks that are based on a single channel and asynchronous transmissions (i.e., no time slotting). FAMA-NCS (for floor acquisition multiple access with non-persisstent carrier sensing) guarantees that a single sender is able to send data packets free of collisions to a given receiver at any given time. FAMA-NCS is based on a three-way handshake between sender and receiver in which the sender uses non-persistent carrier sensing to transmit a request-to-send (RTS) and the receiver sends a clear-to-send (CTS) that lasts much longer than the RTS to serve as a "bust tone" that forces all hidden nodes to back off long enough to allow a collision-free data packet to arrive at the receiver. It is shown that carrier sensing is needed to support collision-free transmissions in the presence of hidden terminals when nodes transmit RTSs asynchornously. The throughput of FAMA-NCS is analyzed for single-channel networks with and without hidden terminals; the analysis shows that FAMA-NCS performs better than ALOHA, CSMA, and all prior proposals based on collision avoidance diualogues (e.g., MACA, MACAW, and IEEE 802.11 DFWMAC) in the presence of hidden terminals. Simulations experiments are used to confirm the analytical results.

Reference-contexts: Since the time SRMA was first proposed, several other medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for either single-channel wireless networks or wireline local area networks that are based on similar RTS-CTS exchanges, or based on RTSs followed by pauses <ref> [2, 26, 7, 16, 18, 20] </ref>. Karn [12] proposed a protocol called MACA (multiple access collision avoidance) to address the problems of hidden terminals in single-channel networks. <p> Section 2 describes FAMA-NCS and a variant of FAMA based on packet sensing (i.e., the transmission of RTSs without carrier sensin), which amounts to MACA or SRMA using ALOHA. Although the original motivation for such protocols as MACA, IEEE 802.11 DFWMAC, MACAW <ref> [2] </ref>, and BAPU [26] was to solve the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA by using RTS-CTS handshakes, it is easy to show by example that simply introducing three-way handshakes (RTS-CTS-data) or even more complex handshakes (RTS-CTS-data-ACK or others) does not suffice to eliminate all instances in which two or more senders are <p> We also specify FAMA-NCS as using a uniform distribution when choosing backoff times; however, other backoff strategies can be adopted (e.g., see those proposed for MACAW <ref> [2] </ref>). To simplify our analysis and description of FAMA-NCS, we do not address the effect of acknowledgments in the rest of this paper, and assume the simplest three-way handshake (RTS-CTS-data) with no acknowledgments. while station A is attempting to send its RTS and acquire the floor. <p> Following the deferment specified by the RTS, a station with a packet to send waits a random waiting period before it transmits an RTS. MACA and improvements over it are also discussed in detail by Bharghavan et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. 8 Variable Definitions CD = Carrier Detected T PROP = Maximum channel propagation delay T PROC = Processing time for carrier detection T TR = Transmit to receive turn-around time fl = Time to transmit an RTS packet fl 0 = Time to transmit a CTS packet ffi = Time <p> Table 1 show the results for FAMA-NCS as compared to MACAW 4 <ref> [2] </ref>. To illustrate the importance of carrier sensing, we chose to compare FAMA-NCS against MACAW instead of FAMA-NPS, , because MACAW uses packet-sensing and RTS-CTS handshakes and its performance has been reported before by Bharghavan et al. [2]. <p> Table 1 show the results for FAMA-NCS as compared to MACAW 4 <ref> [2] </ref>. To illustrate the importance of carrier sensing, we chose to compare FAMA-NCS against MACAW instead of FAMA-NPS, , because MACAW uses packet-sensing and RTS-CTS handshakes and its performance has been reported before by Bharghavan et al. [2]. The physical parameters of the radio assumed a null transmit-to-receive turnaround time and transmitter ramp-up time, we also assumed transmission preamble and framing of 0 bits. These parameters were chosen in order to obtain the same results for MACAW that have been reported previously [2]. <p> before by Bharghavan et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. The physical parameters of the radio assumed a null transmit-to-receive turnaround time and transmitter ramp-up time, we also assumed transmission preamble and framing of 0 bits. These parameters were chosen in order to obtain the same results for MACAW that have been reported previously [2]. Our results are only meant for comparative purposes. In configuration (a) of Fig. 13 all stations are within range of all others (no hidden terminals). Traffic was generated at each node (N1 - N6) directed to the base station. <p> Additionally, fairness is not an issue in FAMA-NCS. Even the simple uniformly distributed backoff scheme gives all stations basically an equal share of the channel without the complex housekeeping suggested in MACAW <ref> [2] </ref>. As expected, FAMA-NCS with packet trains of up to five packets in a train improves over single-packet transmissions by about 14% in the fully connected network and 17% for the two-base station 29 configuration. <p> This protocol, however, was designed for LANs in which stations can sense the channel while transmitting. A number of techniques have been proposed by Bharghavan et al <ref> [2] </ref> to improve the performance of MACA [12], which constitutes a variant of FAMA using RTS-CTS exchange and no carrier sensing. These techniques consist of different retransmission strategies and additional handshaking between sender and receiver. The resulting protocol is called MACAW. <p> Contrary to the conjectures made in prior work on MAC protocols based on collision avoidance <ref> [2, 12] </ref>, our verification and throughput analysis demonstrates that carrier sensing should be used in single channel networks because it substantially improves 31 performance by enabling floor acquisition in the presence of hidden terminals.

Reference-contexts: Again, because the CTS is longer than the RTS plus the transmit to receive turnaround time, A hears the end of the CTS as noise and backs off. 2.2 FAMA-NCS FAMA-NCS combines non-persistent carrier sensing with the RTS-CTS exchange. This is similar to SRMA with CSMA, IEEE 802.11 DFWMAC <ref> [3] </ref>, and Apple's Local Talk Link Access protocol [20]. However, none of these and other protocols based on carrier sensing and RTS-CTS handshakes provide floor acquisition in networks with hidden terminals.

Reference-contexts: As such, they are likely to play an important role in the future of computer communication. The medium access control (MAC) protocol with which packet-radios (or stations) can share a common broadcast channel is essential in a packet-radio network. CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) protocols <ref> [14] </ref> have been used in a number of packet-radio networks in the past [15]; these protocols attempt to prevent a station from transmitting simultaneously with other stations within its transmitting range by requiring each station to listen to the channel before transmitting. <p> This can be done using different persistence and backoff strategies. In this paper, we choose to consider non-persistent protocols over persistent protocols, because the throughput of non-persistent CSMA is much higher under high load and only slightly lower under low load than the throughput of p-persistent CSMA <ref> [14] </ref>. We also specify FAMA-NCS as using a uniform distribution when choosing backoff times; however, other backoff strategies can be adopted (e.g., see those proposed for MACAW [2]). <p> must send more and more CTSs to ensure that its neighbors are aware of its pending reception of a data packet, which renders the approach inefficient. 4 Comparative Throughput Analysis 4.1 Assumptions and Notations We present an approximate throughput analysis that assumes the same traffic model first introduced for CSMA <ref> [14] </ref> to analyze the throughput of CSMA protocols, and the conditions for floor acquisition derived in Section 3. <p> The throughput of non-persistent CSMA used in this analysis was reported by Kleinrock and Tobagi <ref> [14] </ref>. We have reported previously the throughput of FAMA-NPS [8]. We compare these protocols in fully-connected networks, wireless LANs with hidden terminals, and ad-hoc networks. <p> The average channel utilization is given by <ref> [14] </ref> S = U =(B + I) (1) where B is the expected duration of a busy period, defined to be a period of time during which the channel is being utilized; I is the expected duration of an idle period, defined as the time interval between two consecutive busy periods; <p> To further simplify the problem, we assume that two or more transmissions that overlap in time in the channel must all be retransmitted, and that a packet propagates to all stations in exactly t seconds <ref> [14] </ref>. The later assumption provides a lower bound on the performance of the protocols we analyze. <p> For the case of non-persistent CSMA, we assume <ref> [14] </ref> that a separate perfect channel is used for acknowledgments to let a station know when its packet was received free of collisions, and that all acknowledgments are sent reliably Therefore, the throughput of non-persistent CSMA used for comparison with FAMA protocols is only an upper bound. <p> Therefore, as in non-persistent CSMA, the duration of the average failed transmission period is given by <ref> [14] </ref> T F AIL = fl + t + Y .

To acquire the floor, a station sends an RTS using either packet sensing or carrier sensing. <p> 1.00 10.00 100.00 1000.00 S (Throughput) Offered Load: G High Speed Channel, and large packets FAMA-NCS Slotted FAMA-NCS FAMA-NPS Slotted FAMA-NPS CSMA 4.3 Throughput in Wireless LANs To study the performance of FAMA-NCS in wireless LANs with hidden-terminals, we adopt the same tractable model first used by Tobagi and Kleinrock <ref> [22] </ref> to analyze the impact of hidden terminals in CSMA. <p> All terminals are within line-of-sight and range of the base station, but they may be hidden from one another. The population of terminals is partitioned into N independent groups <ref> [22] </ref>, such that all terminals within the same group can hear one another and the base station, and any two terminals from different groups are hidden from each other. <p> To visualize the above results, we compare FAMA-NCS and CSMA in wireless LANs with independent groups hidden from one another, and with one common central station. This type of experiment is similar to the ones used by Tobagi and Kleinrock <ref> [22] </ref>. Fig. 9 shows the maximum attainable throughput of ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, non-persistent CSMA, and FAMA-NCS versus an increasing numbers of independent groups (N ). <p> The results indicate that, FAMA-NCS's performance under hidden terminals becomes that of a packet-sensing FAMA protocol operating in a fully connected network, which is exactly the desired result. In contrast, as has been reported by Kleinrock and Tobagi <ref> [22] </ref>, CSMA quickly degrades to ALOHA. Another way to look at the behavior of FAMA-NCS in a wireless LAN with hidden terminals is by considering a complimentary-couple configuration. In this configuration, a fraction of the population is hidden from the rest. <p> We include the performance of non-persistent CSMA predicted by the model developed by Kleinrock and Tobagi when hidden terminals exist <ref> [22] </ref>; this value of throughput is only an upper bound on CSMA, because it assumes a separate ideal channel over which acknowledgments to packets are sent correctly in zero time. <p> We have shown through our analysis and supported by simulations that FAMA-NCS solves the hidden terminal problems of CSMA <ref> [22] </ref> in wireless LANS with hidden terminals and ad-hoc networks, because it is able to enforce floor acquisition. Our analysis illustrates the performance improvement obtained by allowing the transmission of packet trains in the clear, and a method to enable packet trains even with hidden terminals.

Reference-contexts: The limitations of this scheme is that it still requires a separate busy-tone channel and full-duplex operation at the receiver. One of the first protocols for wireless networks based on a handshake between sender and receiver was the SRMA (split-channel reservation multiple access) <ref> [23] </ref>. According to SRMA, the sender of a packet uses ALOHA or CSMA to decide when to send a request-to-send (RTS) to the receiver. <p> The basic principles of floor acquisition are inspired on earlier work by Kleinrock and Tobagi on BTMA [22], the use of RTS-CTS exchanges first described for SRMA <ref> [23] </ref>, and the provision of priorities among packets introduced for the transmission of priority acknowledgments in ALOHA and CSMA [24]. To acquire the floor, a station sends an RTS using either packet sensing or carrier sensing.

To acquire the floor, a station sends an RTS using either packet sensing or carrier sensing. The first variant corresponds to using the ALOHA protocol for the transmission of RTSs; the second 4 consists of using a CSMA protocol to transmit RTSs. <p> This is similar to the schemes for the provision of priority acknowledgments proposed for CSMA and ALOHA by Kleinrock and Tobagi <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> (a) with hidden terminals, CSMA degrades to pure ALOHA; (b) implementing ALOHA with a single channel requires the use of acknowledgments to let the senders' of packets know if they need to retransmit; (c) implementing priority acknowledgment schemes (e.g., the schemes proposed for ALOHA and CSMA by Tobagi and Kleinrock <ref> [24] </ref>) do not work well with hidden terminals; and (d) slotted ALOHA has better performance than pure ALOHA. 25 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 S (Throughput) Offered Load: G FAMA-NCS for 10 Neighbors, with variable Q in 1 mb/s ideal channel Q = 0 Q = N/2 Q = N

Reference-contexts: Since the time SRMA was first proposed, several other medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for either single-channel wireless networks or wireline local area networks that are based on similar RTS-CTS exchanges, or based on RTSs followed by pauses <ref> [2, 26, 7, 16, 18, 20] </ref>. Karn [12] proposed a protocol called MACA (multiple access collision avoidance) to address the problems of hidden terminals in single-channel networks. <p> Section 2 describes FAMA-NCS and a variant of FAMA based on packet sensing (i.e., the transmission of RTSs without carrier sensin), which amounts to MACA or SRMA using ALOHA. Although the original motivation for such protocols as MACA, IEEE 802.11 DFWMAC, MACAW [2], and BAPU <ref> [26] </ref> was to solve the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA by using RTS-CTS handshakes, it is easy to show by example that simply introducing three-way handshakes (RTS-CTS-data) or even more complex handshakes (RTS-CTS-data-ACK or others) does not suffice to eliminate all instances in which two or more senders are led to believe

Reference-contexts: A receiver initiated busy-tone multiple access protocol for packet-radio networks has also been proposed <ref> [28] </ref>. In this scheme, the sender transmits a request-to-send (RTS) to the receiver, before sending a data packet. When the receiver obtains a correct RTS, it transmits a busy tone in a separate channel to alert other sources nearby that they should backoff.
