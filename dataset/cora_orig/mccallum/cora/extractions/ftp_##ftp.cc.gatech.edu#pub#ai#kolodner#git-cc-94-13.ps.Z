Abstract: We review Margaret Boden's book The Creative Mind, an excellent survey and synthesis of current computational theories of creativity. Boden's stated goal is to explain how creativity (as a psychological phenomenon) is possible, where an explanation of possibility is taken to be a computational process. Although Boden does not deliver a full-fledged computational explanation and leaves most details of the underlying processes unexplicated, she provides a strong argument that such an explanation is possible. As part of our critique, we sketch our preferred (case-based) framework for modeling creativity, in which much of mental life depends on the retrieval and manipulation of past experiences. We focus on five major influences on cognition (and thus on creativity): inference, knowledge, task, situation, and strategic control. We also highlight "constructive modeling" which integrates analogical reasoning with visual reasoning and thought experimentation. Our framework, while broadly compatible with Boden's, is more specific in its suggestions for integrating multiple types of interacting and interactive processes. We emphasize issues of control and the role of experience. By focusing on how mental activity is directed towards a task in some situation, we ensure that the resulting theory addresses pragmatic issues in thinking and control of thinking.

Reference-contexts: 1 Computational Creativity Margaret Boden, a master at bringing ideas from artificial intelligence and cognitive science to the masses, has done it again. In The Creative Mind <ref> (Boden, 1990) </ref>, she has produced a well-written, well-argued review and synthesis of current computational theories relevant to creativity. This book seems appropriately pitched for students in survey courses and for the intelligent lay public.

Reference-contexts: The reader must construct an appropriate model of this world, and interpret the story with respect to this model even as the model evolves. The reader must also be willing to suspend disbelief <ref> (Corrigan, 1979) </ref> to understand concepts which do not fit into a standard world view. This is another example of a strategic control mechanism that requires a willingness to take a cognitive risk.

Reference-contexts: We believe that in order to analyze creative reasoning, one needs a theoretical computational framework in which to model thinking. To this end, we propose using a computational approach rooted in case-based reasoning <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>. This paradigm is fundamentally concerned with memory issues, such as remindings from partial matches at varying levels of representation and the formation of analogical maps between seemingly disparate situations exactly the kinds of phenomena that researchers up to, and including, Boden have highlighted as central to creativity.

Reference-contexts: Elaboration and adaptation include standard analogical processes as well as the 5 more general process of constructive modeling, discussed at length in Section 5. Evaluation includes outcome determination, be it by simulation or by case-based prediction. All of these processes follow from our enriched case-based reasoning model <ref> (Kolodner, 1994) </ref>, and fit together into a coherent whole within that framework.

Reference-contexts: Some strategic control heuristics are more deliberate, based on reflection. For example, one heuristic our designers used was to try quick, easy adaptations of a proposed solution first before stepping back and reformulating the problem or relaxing constraints <ref> (Wills & Kolodner, 1993a, 1994a) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: (1992) shows how this can lead to useful problem reformulations which facilitate the operationalization of abstract advice (in the form of proverbs) during planning situations), * visualization, mental simulation, and thought experimentation, which we have seen to be useful in evaluating and elaborating ideas, and in reformulating problems in design <ref> (Kolodner & Wills, 1993b) </ref> and scientific reasoning (Nersessian, 1992, 1993), * constraint relaxation and substitution, which is useful in problem reformulation and elaboration (e.g., Moorman & Ram (1994a) show how new concepts can be formed or understood, while reading science fiction stories, by systematically tweaking con straints on known, familiar objects), <p> This focus on individual launches helped suggest a new way of looking at the problem <ref> (Kolodner & Wills, 1993b) </ref>. 3.4 Situation Situation is our fourth aspect of thought. Design does not typically occur in a vacuum. <p> A similar mechanism is seen in creative interpretation, in which the reader must suspend disbelief in unfamiliar aspects of a story in order to understand it (see below). Sometimes, as constraints are relaxed or placed at a lower priority, an opportunity to reformulate the problem is revealed <ref> (Kolodner & Wills, 1993b) </ref>. Noticing invariants (Kaplan & Simon, 1990), as well as anomalies, can also aid in understanding a problem and reveal ways of redescribing it. Some strategic control heuristics are more deliberate, based on reflection.

Reference-contexts: The new concepts are constructed by merging and extending the existing concepts representing human agents and robotic artifacts, resulting in a novel view of the situation at hand <ref> (Moorman & Ram, 1994a) </ref>. The reader must adopt this view to build an appropriate story model. <p> methods, and control strategies that are available. 5 Constructive Modeling Reading and understanding Men are Different requires the invention of a system of concepts and theories that represent a sentient, humanoid robot, through the extension of one's prior understanding of multiple concepts, such as volitional agents, men, and industrial robots <ref> (Moorman & Ram, 1994a) </ref>. In creative design, too, new conceptual structures are formed from multiple sources. Problem descriptions are incrementally elaborated and reformulated, typically by analogy to pieces of several similar problems. New design ideas are generated by combining several ideas from experiences with existing devices.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, the irony in this story derives from the fact that the robot in the story performs what one might view as the reverse inference: conceptualizing the man as a physical object to be repaired in a manner that one might use to repair a physical robotic device <ref> (Moorman & Ram, 1994b) </ref>. It would, of course, be unreasonable to assume a special purpose "meta-search space" generator for science fiction story understanding. The creative understanding processes required to read Men Are Different are not unique to science fiction stories; understanding any fictional story requires similar kinds of processing.

Reference-contexts: Designers draw on a variety of knowledge sources, particularly previous design experiences, accumulated from personally designing artifacts, studying case studies of designs in school, and observing artifacts designed by others. Designers typically work within a "design culture" <ref> (Navinchandra, 1992) </ref> of common engineering practices, design styles, techniques, and technologies. Innovation often arises when ideas from one culture are applied in another. In our ME design study, one designer 7 drew much inspiration from automotive engineering, a design culture in which he is intensely interested.

Reference-contexts: Boden's answer to this is that some operators carry out conceptual change (Carey, 1985; Nersessian, 1992; Ram, 1993; Thagard, 1992) and thus fundamentally modify the search space. This account falls short in two ways: first, conceptual change is as elusive a notion as creativity itself <ref> (Nersessian, 1992) </ref>, and second, it is not obvious why the search space generated by application of conceptual change operators is not considered part of the thinkable. An independent (and operationalized) characterization of what makes these conceptual change operators different from all the other more ordinary inferential operations is needed. <p> useful problem reformulations which facilitate the operationalization of abstract advice (in the form of proverbs) during planning situations), * visualization, mental simulation, and thought experimentation, which we have seen to be useful in evaluating and elaborating ideas, and in reformulating problems in design (Kolodner & Wills, 1993b) and scientific reasoning <ref> (Nersessian, 1992, 1993) </ref>, * constraint relaxation and substitution, which is useful in problem reformulation and elaboration (e.g., Moorman & Ram (1994a) show how new concepts can be formed or understood, while reading science fiction stories, by systematically tweaking con straints on known, familiar objects), * relaxing constraints during memory search, which

Reference-contexts: Boden argues that true creativity (as opposed to mere novelty) occurs when a person thinks a thought that is outside the space of thoughts that are even conceivable to that person - outside, as it were, their knowledge level <ref> (Newell, 1982) </ref>. To clarify this idea, she invokes representations, rules, and search spaces, noting that fixing these constructs limits what can be generated by the thought processes of the reasoner. Creativity, then, requires the modification of these structures in order to expand their generative capacity.

By playing with the springs, noticing problems, and suggesting fixes, the designers formed a specific, concrete description of what they needed. <p> We observed a variety of strategic control heuristics used by our ME designers. Some were opportunistic. An example is letting extremes distract. When an alternative was proposed that satisfied some desired criteria extremely well compared to the other alternatives, our designers directed their efforts toward elaborating that alternative <ref> (Wills & Kolodner, 1994b) </ref>. They optimistically suspended criticism or discounted the importance of criteria or constraints that were not satisfied as well. Suspending criticism during brainstorming is a common strategic ideation technique which involves taking a cognitive risk.
