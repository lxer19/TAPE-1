Abstract: This paper describes the adaptation approach of reusable knowledge representation components used in the KSM environment for the formulation and operationalisation of structured knowledge models. Reusable knowledge representation components in KSM are called primitives of representation. A primitive of representation provides: (1) a knowledge representation formalism (2) a set of tasks that use this knowledge together with several problemsolving methods to carry out these tasks (3) a knowledge acquisition module that provides different services to acquire and validate this knowledge (4) an abstract terminology about the linguistic categories included in the representation language associated to the primitive. Primitives of representation usually are domain independent. A primitive of representation can be adapted to support knowledge in a given domain by importing concepts from this domain. The paper describes how this activity can be carried out by mean of a terminological importation. Informally, a terminological importation partially populates an abstract terminology with concepts taken from a given domain. The information provided by the importation can be used by the acquisition and validation facilities to constraint the classes of knowledge that can be described using the representation formalism according to the domain knowledge. KSM provides the LINKS language to specify terminological importation from a domain terminology to an abstract one. These terminologies are described in KSM by mean of the CONCEL language. Terminological importation is used to adapt reusable primitives of representation in order to increase the usability degree of such components in these domains. In addition, two primitives of representation can share a common vocabulary by importing common domain CONCEL terminologies (conceptual vocabularies). It is a necessary condition to make possible the interoperability between different, heterogeneous knowledge representation components in the framework of complex knowledge - based architectures.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the idea of ontological mappings is used in modelling languages as OCML [Motta, 98], KARL [Fensel, 95] or ML 2 [van Harmelen,Balder,92], or in environments such as PROTEGE-II <ref> [Gennari et al, 94] </ref>. The main difference between terminological importation and the mappings used in these knowledge modelling approaches is that terminological importation is partial in nature. Knowledge in primitives of representation is not derived as a refinement of CONCEL definitions. Indeed, CONCEL can describe only terminological knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Related work The idea of terminological importation can be related to the more general framework of RQWRORJLFDO PDSSLQJV [Park et al, 98]. These mappings are used in different knowledge modelling frameworks to relate ontologies formulated to different levels <ref> [Wielinga et al, 92; Puerta et al, 92; Motta, 97] </ref>. In particular, the idea of ontological mappings is used in modelling languages as OCML [Motta, 98], KARL [Fensel, 95] or ML 2 [van Harmelen,Balder,92], or in environments such as PROTEGE-II [Gennari et al, 94].
