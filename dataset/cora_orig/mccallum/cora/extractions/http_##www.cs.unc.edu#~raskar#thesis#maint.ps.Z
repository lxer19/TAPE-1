Abstract: Designing mechanical systems for efficient disassembly improves their maintainability. Design disassembly issues involved in a maintainability analysis of an evolving mechanical system design are discussed. Procedures and methodologies for the identification of disassembly sequence, animation of human technicians while carrying out the disassembly sequence, tool selection, time and cost analysis, and human factors analysis of the disassembly sequence are presented. Their software implementation in a maintainability analysis workstation is described and illustrated in a maintenance task example.
