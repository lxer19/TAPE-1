Abstract: We are studying a large collection of digital images having nearly 30,000 members. We regard each image in the collection as an individual observation. To facilitate our study we construct an index of the images in the collection. The index utilizes a small copy of each image (a thumbnail) to represent the full-size version. A large number of these thumbnails are laid out in a workstation window. We can interactively arrange and rearrange the thumbnails within the window. For example, we can sort the thumbnails by the values of a function computed from them or by the values of data associated with each of them. By the use of specialized equipment (a single-frame video disk recorder/player), we can instantaneously access any individual full-size image in the collection as a video image. We regard our software as the beginning of the development of exploratory tools for studying collections of images as we routinely study batches of numbers. Our focus to date has been on developing a tool that will assist in selecting individual images for inspection. We anticipate that in the future we may wish to consider summary information and distributional properties of various aspects of the images. The talk included a videotape of our system in use.

Reference-contexts: Retrieving and sorting images using those attributes as keys can be accomplished as an enhancement of standard database technology with the ability to handle images. Such attempts are usually referred to as multi-media databases <ref> (see, e.g., Cantell, 1991) </ref>. We want to index images by their contents to better use the ability of the human visual system to detect relationships and unusual features. Our index of the images contains a small version of each image (a thumbnail) that is displayed in a window.

Reference-contexts: Sorting of the contact sheet by the value of any predetermined variable is simple. We have, in addition to the images recorded on video disk, the database of information associated with each image. The sorting method that we use is stable <ref> (see, e.g. Knuth, 1973, page 4) </ref>; a stable sorting method preserves the initial order of records with equal sorting keys. We have chosen to use a stable sort so that we may provide hierarchical sorting without sorting on multiple keys simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: The selection of all images with certain properties could be used to select smaller subsets of a large image-base to improve interactive performance. Since the data associated with each image could be in numeric form we could use statistical-graphical tools like XGobi <ref> (Swayne, Cook, and Buja, 1991) </ref> to produce sections, do brushing, and have dynamically-linked thumbnail contact sheet that changes in accordance with those operations. The contact sheet could be more than a two-dimensional rectangular array.
