Abstract: Following Ajtai's lead, Ajtai and Dwork have recently introduced a public-key encryption scheme which is secure under the assumption that a certain computational problem on lattices is hard on the worst-case. Their encryption method may cause decryption errors, though with small probability (i.e., inversely proportional to the security parameter). In this paper we modify the encryption method of Ajtai and Dwork so that the legitimate receiver always recovers the message sent. That is, we make the Ajtai-Dwork Cryptosystem error-free.

Reference-contexts: It is thus important to have as many alternative/unrelated assumption as possible, so that Cryptography can be based on any one of them. So far there are very few alternatives; and so Ajtai's work <ref> [1] </ref>, which suggests a new domain out of which adequately-hard problems can be found, marks an important day for Cryptography. In particular, Ajtai constructed a one-way function based on the assumption that Lattice Reduction is hard in the worst-case.

Reference-contexts: In particular, Ajtai constructed a one-way function based on the assumption that Lattice Reduction is hard in the worst-case. Following his lead, Ajtai and Dwork have recently introduced a public-key encryption scheme which is secure, provided that the following (worst-case complexity) assumption holds <ref> [2] </ref>: Assumption ISVP (Infeasibility of Shortest Vector Problem): There exists no polynomial-time algorithm, which given an arbitrary basis for an n-dimensional lattice, having a "unique poly (n)-shortest vector", finds the shortest (non-zero) vector in the lattice. <p> By having a unique poly (n)-shortest vector we mean that any vector of length at most poly (n) times bigger than the shortest vector is an integer multiple of the shortest vector. The encryption method of Ajtai and Dwork <ref> [2] </ref>, has a non-zero decryption--error probability. <p> Thus, we obtain a error-free encryption scheme which is secure under the same assumption used by Ajtai and Dwork. 2 The Encryption Scheme In this section we recall the construction of Ajtai and Dwork <ref> [2] </ref> and describe our modification of it. We start by introducing a few notations which are used throughout the paper. 2.1 Notations We denote the set of integers by Z, and the set of real numbers by R. <p> We denote this process by v 0 = v mod P . 2.2 The Ajtai-Dwork Construction Let us recall the Ajtai-Dwork construction. 3 To simplify the exposition we present the scheme in terms of real numbers, but we always mean numbers with some fixed finite precision. (Following <ref> [2] </ref>, one should use n-bit binary expansion of real numbers when working with security parameter n). 3 The scheme which we describe below is slightly different than the original scheme in [2]. The difference between these schemes is insignificant, however (this is mostly a matter of presentation style). Common Parameters. <p> present the scheme in terms of real numbers, but we always mean numbers with some fixed finite precision.

The difference between these schemes is insignificant, however (this is mostly a matter of presentation style). Common Parameters. Given security parameter n, we let m def def 2 n log n . We denote by B n (for Big or cuBe) the n-dimensional cube of side-length n . <p> In the sequel, we often use the notations w def def def (Remark: It is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that of we pick w 1 ; : : : ; w n uniformly in H u , then the width of P (w 1 ; : : : ; w n ) will be large enough, with probability at least 1n 1=2 .) Encryption. <p> Decryption (modified): Given a ciphertext, x, and the private-key u, we compute t = hv; ui. We decrypt the ciphertext as a '0' if t is within 1=4 of some integer and decrypt it as a '1' otherwise. In contrast to the encryption scheme in <ref> [2] </ref>, we can show that in our scheme there is no decryption error. <p> the same arguments, using the fact that h 1 2 n 7 . ut 4 Otherwise, we may simply use the identity function for encryption/decryption. 3 Security of the Modified Scheme To prove the security of the modified scheme, we start by invoking the main result of Ajtai and Dwork <ref> [2] </ref>: Theorem 2 [2, Thm 7.1]: Under Assumption ISVP, it is infeasible to distinguish the encryption of = 0 from a uniformly distributed point in P (w), when given w; v. (We stress that w; v and the encryption of `0' are distributed as described above.) Note that this theorem establishes <p> using the fact that h 1 2 n 7 . ut 4 Otherwise, we may simply use the identity function for encryption/decryption. 3 Security of the Modified Scheme To prove the security of the modified scheme, we start by invoking the main result of Ajtai and Dwork [2]: Theorem 2 <ref> [2, Thm 7.1] </ref>: Under Assumption ISVP, it is infeasible to distinguish the encryption of = 0 from a uniformly distributed point in P (w), when given w; v. (We stress that w; v and the encryption of `0' are distributed as described above.) Note that this theorem establishes the security (as <p> encryption of = 0 from a uniformly distributed point in P (w), when given w; v. (We stress that w; v and the encryption of `0' are distributed as described above.) Note that this theorem establishes the security (as defined in [3]) of the encryption scheme of Ajtai and Dwork <ref> [2] </ref>, since in that scheme = 1 is encrypted as a uniformly chosen point in P (w). <p> The current lemma follows. ut Combining Lemmas 4 and 5, we have established Theorem 3. Comment An alternative proof of Theorem 3. The security of the encryption scheme in <ref> [2] </ref> is established via a sequence of reductions. The first reduction assumes an algorithm D which distinguishes between encryptions of 0's and 1's. <p> The first reduction assumes an algorithm D which distinguishes between encryptions of 0's and 1's. It then constructs another algorithm D 0 which distinguishes between sequences of vectors (w; v) which constitute a public-key, and sequences uniformly distributed points in the big cube B n (See <ref> [2, Lemma 8.1] </ref>). On a high level, this is done as follows: Algorithm D 0 uses the input vectors, (w; v), to encrypt 0's and 1's as if they constitute a public-key. <p> If D is able to distinguish between encryptions of 0's and 1's, then D 0 concludes that these vectors indeed constitute a public-key. Otherwise, D concludes that they are just uniformly distributed points. One can easily verify the argument in <ref> [2] </ref> holds also for distinguishers of encryptions under our modified scheme.
