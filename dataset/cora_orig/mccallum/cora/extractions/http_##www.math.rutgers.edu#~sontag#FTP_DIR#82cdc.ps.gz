Reference-contexts: It follows from the theorem in 1 r the Appendix (see also <ref> [1] </ref>) that O (x,l) is an (immersed) submanifold of M, of dimension equal to (1.5). Furthermore, if y is any given state in the orbit O (x,l), then the sup is achieved among those w such that f (x,w) = y. <p> Note that, n n n n 11 in particular, one could choose the a to be rationally independent. n 12 APPENDIX We provide here a (fairly straightforward) generalization of the theorem, given in [5] for continuous time systems (see also <ref> [1] </ref> for a discrete time version) establishing that orbits (weak reachability sets) are submanifolds in a natural way.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, if y is any given state in the orbit O (x,l), then the sup is achieved among those w such that f (x,w) = y. In connection with the results in <ref> [3] </ref>, we point out in the Appendix that the connected component of O (x,l) which contains x is equal to the orbit of x under the normal subgroup of G l generated by all the transformations of the form (1.6) f (.,u,v;a,-a).

Reference-contexts: Recall that (1.1) is said to satify the accessibility [resp., strong accessibility] property from x <ref> [4] </ref> iff the (positive time) reachable set A (x) [resp., the set A (x) of states reachable from x in time exactly t, for some t t&gt;0] has a nonempty interior. <p> Since O (x,l) is a submanifold and A (x,l) is included in it, it follows that (c) implies (b). It only remains to establish that (a) implies (d). Let dimL (x) = n, so (1.1) is strongly accessible from x. From the results in <ref> [4] </ref> --or as a corollary to the o theorem in the Appendix,- it follows that there exist a state y, positive numbers t , ..., t , T, and a 1 r sequence of control values u ...u (in int (U), if desired,) such that 1 r (2.3) F: R (T)

Reference-contexts: Now pick any sequence -a - satisfying (3.17) and such that a &gt;b for all n. Note that, n n n n 11 in particular, one could choose the a to be rationally independent. n 12 APPENDIX We provide here a (fairly straightforward) generalization of the theorem, given in <ref> [5] </ref> for continuous time systems (see also [1] for a discrete time version) establishing that orbits (weak reachability sets) are submanifolds in a natural way.
