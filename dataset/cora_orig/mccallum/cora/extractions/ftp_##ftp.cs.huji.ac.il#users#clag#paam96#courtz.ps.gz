Reference-contexts: A student is assumed to have some notion of his preferences over different courses, and additionally has constraints. However, this information is not necessarily sufficient for posing a query to a database system; in many ways it is fuzzy <ref> [1, 6] </ref> or incomplete.

Reference-contexts: Needless to say, this information cannot all be learned from the user: some of it must come from semantic knowledge of the domain supplied to Courtz (by the designer or by some other agent, e.g., Musag <ref> [4] </ref>). As another illustration of the use of fuzzy functions, the user is presented with a choice of times such as "morning," "noon," "afternoon" and "evening." This makes specifying the request less tedious for the user, but more vague to Courtz.

Interface agents were defined in <ref> [7] </ref> as [C]omputer programs that employ artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide assistance to a user dealing with a particular application : : : The metaphor is that of a personal assistant who is collaborating with the user in the same work environment.

Reference-contexts: The other part of the problem, learning the ff values in the utility equation above, is a problem of learning a vector of weights in a linear combination. This is a relatively simple problem by itself, equivalent to the perceptron learning problem <ref> [8] </ref>. We will refer to this problem as the weight learning problem.
