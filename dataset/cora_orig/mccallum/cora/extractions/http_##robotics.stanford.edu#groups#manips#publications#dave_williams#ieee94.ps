Title: A Control Structure for Multi-Grasp Manipulation Tasks with Internal Force Dynamics

Abstract: In this paper, we present a control structure for dextrous, multi-grasp manipulation based on the integration of two basic concepts: the virtual linkage and the augmented object. The virtual linkage provides a physical representation of internal forces and moments by representing the manipulated object with an equivalent closed-chain mechanism. Forces and moments applied at the grasp points of this mechanism cause joint forces and torques at its actuators. When these actuators are subjected to the opposing forces and torques, the virtual linkage becomes a locked structure. Internal forces in the object are then characterized by these forces and torques. To control object motion, we describe the operational-space, rigid-body dynamics for the multi-manipulator/object system using the augmented object. With this concept, motion of the manipulated object and the forces it applies to the environment are controlled by operational forces at some selected point on the object. Internal forces are then characterized by the virtual linkage and controlled independently. This approach enables a multi-arm robot system to manipulate objects while performing accurate control of internal forces. Simulation results are presented, as well as experimental results for a multi-arm system of three PUMA 560 manipulators.

Reference-contexts: In [13], a controller was developed for a pair of one-dimensional arms with unilateral con-straints. This work was extended in [8] to provide dynamic control of contact conditions. Simulations of a planar two-arm system with rolling contacts were presented. In <ref> [1] </ref>, a multi-arm control system was proposed to close a force-control loop around a resolved-rate controller for each arm. The forces to be applied by each arm were calculated using a cost function that minimized a weighted combination of the applied forces while maintaining the desired resultant.

Reference-contexts: One of the first methods for controlling a two-arm system involved organizing the controller in a master/slave fashion, and using a motion coordination procedure to minimize errors in the relative position of the two manipulators <ref> [2] </ref>. In another study [14], one manipulator was treated as a "leader" and the other as a "follower." Control of the follower was based on the constraint relationships between the two manipulators. Neither of these methods generalized easily to systems with more than two arms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Research dealing with the characterization of internal forces and moments has focused essentially on two issues; minimizing internal forces during manipulation [10, 11], or determining a set of grasp forces that satisfy frictional and stability constraints for point contact without applying excessive force to the manipulated object <ref> [3, 4, 9] </ref>. Typically these approaches establish the relationship between the forces applied to an object and the resultant of these forces at some reference point. They then proceed to solve this relationship using a generalized inverse.

Reference-contexts: This was because kinematic, joint-space constraints were used to achieve coordination in these methods. A control methodology was needed that operated directly on the generalized coordinates of the manipulated object (i.e. object-level control) and accounted for the complete closed-chain dynamics of the system. The augmented object method <ref> [6] </ref> was developed to do exactly that. It controls a multi-arm system by using its closed-chain dynamics to decouple the system in operational space. <p> Such a controller was developed in <ref> [6] </ref>, and introduced the augmented object concept to characterize the system's rigid-body dynamics.

Reference-contexts: The forces to be applied by each arm were calculated using a cost function that minimized a weighted combination of the applied forces while maintaining the desired resultant. A controller was presented in <ref> [7] </ref> which minimized internal forces by requiring each arm to apply an equal force at some reference point on the object. A model following technique was used to provide a reference trajectory for each arm based on the desired state and the actual position/forces.

Reference-contexts: First, consider the quasi-static case where object velocities and accelerations do not affect the internal stress state. In this case, we can characterize object stresses by considering internal forces in an equivalent virtual linkage <ref> [12] </ref>, defined as follows: A virtual linkage associated with an n-grasp manipulation task is a 6 (n1)-degree-of-freedom mechanism whose actuated joints characterize the object's internal forces and moments. <p> There is a one-to-one correspondence between the amount of actuator redundancy and the number of internal forces and moments. This ensures that each internal force can be controlled independently. 2.1 The Grasp Description Matrix It was shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that the relationship between forces and moments applied to the object at the grasp points (f i ), the resultant force and moment at some reference point (F R ), and the internal forces and moments (F I ), can be written as F I = G 4 . . <p> Explicit formulas for G and G 1 are given in <ref> [12] </ref>. For some grasp configurations, the rank of the grasp description matrix G might be deficient. In such a situation, the virtual linkage is at a kinematic singularity; two or more adjacent members are aligned.

Reference-contexts: Each of these methods is able to control the trajectory of an object while minimizing internal forces and moments. However, none provide the ability to specify non-zero internal forces, which can be quite useful for pre-loading in assembly tasks. The importance of this feature was demonstrated in <ref> [15] </ref>, where a trajectory planner was developed to perform the specific task of pre-loading a flexible beam using two coordinating PUMA 560 manipulators. Although a great deal of progress has been made in multi-grasp manipulation, none of the work described above considers internal force dynamics.
