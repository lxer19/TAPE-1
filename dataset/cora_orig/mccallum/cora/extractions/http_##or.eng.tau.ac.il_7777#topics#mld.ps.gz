Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to solve practical problems is complex. Only recently, due to the increased promise of ML in solving real problems and the experienced difficulty of their use, has this issue started to attract attention. This difficulty arises from the complexity of learning problems and the large variety of available techniques. In order to understand this complexity and begin to overcome it, it is important to construct a characterization of learning situations. Building on previous work that dealt with the practical use of ML, a set of dimensions is developed, contrasted with another recent proposal, and illustrated with a project on the development of a decision-support system for marine propeller design. The general research opportunities that emerge from the development of the dimensions are discussed. Leading toward working systems, a simple model is presented for setting priorities in research and in selecting learning tasks within large projects. Central to the development of the concepts discussed in this paper is their use in future projects and the recording of their successes, limitations, and failures.

Reference-contexts: For example, when attempting to understand a complex decision procedure, one can generate traces of the procedure and its recommendations, and use several ML programs to learn multiple simple models of the procedure (Reich et al, 1996b). This process is sometimes called metamodeling <ref> (Blanning, 1975) </ref>. The models need not be good, they can even be poor, as long as they are comprehensible and lead to better understanding of the data. Since quality of models from a statistical perspective is not required, this role can be employed even with small data.

This dimension is influenced by the previous dimension. People mostly learn pro-actively by formal training in schools and universities.

Reference-contexts: Since their characteristics vary at will, they provide ways to obtain detailed understanding of the working of ML programs. If complicated systems are developed in research they can hardly be replicated. Therefore, it is important that not only test problems are shared but also ML programs. For example, Ecobweb <ref> (Reich and Fenves, 1992) </ref> was made available and already used by different research groups. Testing the results of learning in a real setting is more complex. Ultimately, any learning problem is solved only once.

Reference-contexts: This study continues and stresses the focus on the practical objective of ML: "The aim of computational research with respect to learning should ... be to produce computational environments that fit and enhance human practice." <ref> (Reich et al, 1993, p. 165) </ref>. <p> Thus, it is important to know what is the activity that an agent performs when it is learning. Maintaining the context for future reference is a critical and very hard undertaking <ref> (Reich et al, 1993) </ref>. Design activities could be classified into traditional problem-solving methods. They can be useful if analyzed at the right granularity. To illustrate this issue consider finite-element analysis.

Reference-contexts: The two ML roles are two extreme specific instances of using ML. A more refined analysis revealed a seven-step process called Contextualized ML Modeling (CMLM) which is shown in Figure 3 <ref> (Reich, 1997) </ref>. There is significant variety built into the seven-step process. Each step can be executed in different ways. Thus, following Ashby's law of requisite variety (Ashby, 1958), this process has the potential to match the significant variety in learning contexts. The learning context manifests in step 1. <p> Also, the fourth dimension corresponds to the 2nd step in CMLM, the fifth dimension to the 4th step, and the second dimension to parts of steps 1, 2, 6.

Reference-contexts: However, in order to be effective learners, they require certain conditions. For example, they can benefit from certain felicity conditions <ref> (VanLehn, 1983) </ref> that make sure that newly learned knowledge extends existing knowledge by a small margin that could be integrated well with what the learner already knows. The same conditions can be used when designing specific ML programs or for training existing incremental learners.

Reference-contexts: With this estimated cost, and given a constraint on a project budget, and the anticipated benefit from using ML, one could maximize the total benefit by a simple procedure after recognizing that this maximization is an instance of the knapsack problem in operations research <ref> (Winston, 1994) </ref>. In order to solve 11 Reich (1997) Learning in Design/AI EDAM this problem, the potential ML solutions need to be sorted based on a benefit/cost index and they are allocated resources according to this index until the budget is exhausted.
