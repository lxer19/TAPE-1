Reference-contexts: Many a time (as in the case of surgery), the subdatabase that needs to be accessed can be specified in advance providing for advanced staging/caching (using active capability <ref> [CAL93] </ref>). Among the three client-server DBMS architecture proposed in the literature, a combination of EWS and RAD-Unify seems to be appropriate for the real-time client. The caching of data at the client site in this context would mean downloading data on to disks.

Reference-contexts: Among the client-server DBMS architectures proposed in the literature, EWS is appropriate for the regular client. The client subsystem must ensure a close linkage between its components: multi-media DBMS (M 2 DBM S) and the multi-media medical application environment (M 3 AE). M 2 DBM S includes active functionality <ref> [CAM93, CHS93, Sha92] </ref>, supports multiple transactional stores, the notion of time, in an object-oriented framework. The integrated M 3 AE consists of several interdependent modules for viewing and browsing, tools for knowledge discovery, case based matching and reasoning and scientific analysis. <p> The open OODB [WBT92] from Texas Instruments, Dallas is being combined with the functionality of Sentinel <ref> [CHS93, CAM93] </ref> to provide active and multiple transactional store capability. This will be further extended to include other functionality outlined in this paper. 5 Conclusion In this paper we studied a real life scientific application and proposed an architecture to meet its requirements.

Reference-contexts: Customized Graphical User Interface Though the kind of interface necessary varies from group to group in a medical research environment, it is important that the interfaces not be hard wired for a particular group or discipline, since there is a clear need to provide for flexibility in creating new displays <ref> [HK92, CCM92] </ref>. Current multimedia authoring systems [RK91], such as Macromind Director, are oriented toward literal data, linking specific images, text, sounds, etc. together in a hypermedia network. The authoring systems, and indeed the entire field, lack the concept of a database-driven multi/hypermedia presentation of information.

Reference-contexts: Often, the results of an experiment are classified and separated into cases and stored so that incoming data/cases are matched against them. The fundamental strategy of case-based reasoning systems is to address new situations by re-using applicable portion of prior experiences. Although there are a number of techniques developed <ref> [Lea91, Ham89] </ref> for case-based reasoning in AI (for law and non-multi-media medical diagnostics), the problem at hand is more complex and has different characteristics than those studied in the literature. To address this problem, we will concentrate on indexing strategies for efficient retrieval of both formatted and unformatted data.

Reference-contexts: The major stages of the experiment life cycle consist of: i) experiment design, ii) data collection, and iii) data exploration. Data exploration involves data analysis along the lines mentioned under knowledge discovery functionality. Recently, there have been several attempts at providing this support, namely, MOOSE <ref> [IL89, YLH92] </ref>, the "laboratory Notebook" effort at the Los Alamos National Laboratory [Nel90], and the "Chromosome Information System" (CIS) database in LBL supported by the SDT [MF90], and ERDRAW design tools [SM90] For supporting this functionality, we propose a subsystem for the management of an experiment and the data produced throughout

Reference-contexts: This covers a broad spectrum from discovering information that was unexpected to 9 a simple confirmation of a well known fact. The process of knowledge discovery <ref> [KI91] </ref> can be summarized as follows: i) pose a query to the system, ii) peruse and absorb the answer, iii) refine or reformulate the query, and iv) repeat posing the query until the knowledge is discovered.

Reference-contexts: The autonomy of each system needs to be maintained. Hence the server in our approach could be classified as a loosely coupled federation of heterogeneous database systems as in <ref> [LMR90] </ref>. However, we should emphasize that, in the future, each element in the cluster may not necessarily be a DBMS but may include expert systems and knowledge bases. We can identify three key components of the architecture a federated server, the mediator layer and Clients. <p> This is also referred to as a tightly coupled 5 federated system. The second approach is to have a loosely coupled federation or a multidatabase system <ref> [LMR90] </ref> in which there is no unified schema but an extended language is provided to retrieve information from a collection of databases.

Reference-contexts: We intend to use the available interface (e.g., SQL*NET on TCP/IP for Oracle) where possible from the access layer and leave the optimization issues for the component systems where they are adequately supported. 3.1.3 Clients In the literature, three architectures have been proposed for a client DBMS <ref> [RD90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, two approaches have been used for developing a federated DBMS. The first approach provides a globally unified view of all databases in the federation by generating a global/unified schema (by integrating local schema of participating databases) in which structural, semantic, and other types of inconsistencies have been resolved <ref> [SL90] </ref>. This is also referred to as a tightly coupled 5 federated system. The second approach is to have a loosely coupled federation or a multidatabase system [LMR90] in which there is no unified schema but an extended language is provided to retrieve information from a collection of databases.

Reference-contexts: The active capability of the client will be used to i) support constraints ii) to support asynchronous processing of images using triggers iii) to capture context, semantics and multiple perspectives for various groups accessing the databases.
