Abstract: Recent network traffic studies argue that network arrival processes are much more faithfully modeled using statistically self-similar processes instead of traditional Poisson processes [LTWW94a, PF94]. One difficulty in dealing with self-similar models is how to efficiently synthesize traces (sample paths) corresponding to self-similar traffic. We present a fast Fourier transform method for synthesizing approximate self-similar sample paths and assess its performance and validity. We find that the method is as fast or faster than existing methods and appears to generate a closer approximation to true self-similar sample paths than the other known fast method (Random Midpoint Displacement). We then discuss issues in using such synthesized sample paths for simulating network traffic, and how an approximation used by our method can dramatically speed up evaluation of Whittle's estimator for H, the Hurst parameter giving the strength of long-range dependence present in a self-similar time series.

Reference-contexts: In an appendix we give a program written in the S language for implementing our method. 1 2 Self-similar processes We begin with two definitions. A stationary process is long-range dependent (LRD) if its autocorrelation function r (k) is nonsummable (i.e., P k r (k) = 1) <ref> [C84] </ref>. Thus, the definition of long-range dependence applies only to infinite time series. The simplest models with long-range dependence are self-similar processes, which are characterized by hyperbolically-decaying autocorrelation functions. <p> More specifically, the process fX t g t=0;1;2;::: is asymptotically self-similar if r (k) k (22H) L (k) as k ! 1; (1) for Hurst parameter H satisfying 1=2 &lt; H &lt; 1 and L a slowly-varying function 1 ; and the process is exactly self-similar if [BSTW94] <ref> [C84, p.59] </ref>: r (k) = 1=2 (k + 1) 2H 2k 2H + (k 1) 2H fl For any process fX t g t=0;1;2;::: we can consider an "ag gregated" version fX (m) t g constructed by partitioning fX t g into non-overlapping blocks of m sequential elements and constructing a <p> that one must trade off speed of computation (low n) against the degree of agreement with a true self-similar process (asymptoti cally high n). * Consider an M/G/1 queue model, where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and have service times drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution with infinite variance <ref> [C84, LTWW94a, PF94] </ref>. In this model, X t is the number of customers in the system at time t, and fX t g is asymptotically self-similar in the sense of Eqn. 1. <p> We found this to be the case for H 0:7, but that for H 0:75, the variance-time plot was sometimes, usually, or always lower (i.e., steeper-sloped) than expected, as indicated in Table 1. The variance-time plot is based on an asymptotic relationship <ref> [C84] </ref>, so this anomaly may simply be due to stronger long-range dependence (i.e., higher values of H) requiring longer sample paths to exhibit their true dependence.

For example, the presence of long-range dependence completely alters the tail of queue waiting times <ref> [ENW94] </ref>. The theory of self-similar stochastic processes is not nearly as well-developed as that for Poisson processes. <p> For example, one could show that network connection characteristics match the M=G=1 queue or the heavy-tailed on/off models discussed in x 2 (see also <ref> [ENW94] </ref>). Even without compelling evidence of such a match, self-similar models still remain more attractive than traditional Poisson-based models of network arrival processes, since the latter have no long-range dependence whatsoever. <p> In general, on small (e.g., 0.01 seconds) time scales SRD can dominate network arrivals, leading to traffic which is only asymptotically self-similar [LTWW94a]. While the presence of LRD can have a dramatic effect on queueing, SRD can also significantly effect queueing behavior <ref> [ENW94] </ref>. The need to incorporate SRD into simulated network traffic suggests that one should look for ways of distributing individual arrivals within a bin in such a way as to introduce SRD. <p> That is, the entire process might alter. Both the [LTWW94a] and the [PF94] studies analyze network traffic at the link level, and thus do not provide strong guidance for how sources should be modeled (though both studies, and also the related <ref> [ENW94] </ref>, offer arguments concerning how source characteristics could lead to link-level self-similarity). The authors of [GW94], on the other hand, show that video sources should be modeled as self-similar.

Reference-contexts: The drawback of a method based on this observation is that the process is only asymptotically self-similar, so again one must trade off length of computation for degree of self-similarity. * A third method of synthesizing a self-similar process is the "Random Midpoint Displacement" (RMD) method <ref> [LEWW95] </ref>, which works by progressively subdividing an interval over which to generate the sample path. At each division, a Gaussian displacement is used to determine the value of the sample path at the midpoint of the subinterval. Self-similarity comes about by appropriate scaling of the variance of the displacement. <p> about twice as fast on a SPARC-station 20 as on the IPX model, so comparing these timings with those for the RMD method given in x 2 indicates that our implementation of the FFT method runs more than twice as fast as the implementation of the RMD method used by <ref> [LEWW95] </ref>. We then assessed how well samples produced by the method match what we would expect for FGN.

One would expect these methods, however, to underestimate burstiness [PF94]. Another option is to use the RMD method to interpolate further self-similar sample paths within each bin. This approach makes sense if the number of arrivals is large. <p> This approach makes sense if the number of arrivals is large. At some point, however, the number of arrivals is small enough that further interpolation becomes problematic, and perhaps incorrect inasmuch as the arrival process at such fine time scales may no longer be self-similar <ref> [LEWW95] </ref>. An alternative approach relates to a third issue, which is the presence of short-range dependence (SRD) in network arrival processes. In general, on small (e.g., 0.01 seconds) time scales SRD can dominate network arrivals, leading to traffic which is only asymptotically self-similar [LTWW94a].

In this paper we are concerned with synthesizing FGN. There are several existing methods for synthesizing sample paths for self-similar processes|see <ref> [LTWW94b] </ref> for a more complete discussion and citations| but they all have drawbacks: 1 For a slowly-varying function L, lim t!1 L (tx)=L (x) = 1 for all x &gt; 0. <p> While they claim their algorithm reproduces FBM accurately, their assessment of the algorithm's accuracy is very terse, making it difficult to evaluate the method's promise. Most of the synthesis methods take large amounts of CPU time. For example, <ref> [LTWW94b] </ref> discusses an AR (1) method which requires 3-5 minutes to synthesize a trace of 100,000 points when running on a massively parallel computer with 16,384 processors. The first two methods mentioned above have running times on the order of CPU hours for traces of comparable length.

Both the [LTWW94a] and the <ref> [PF94] </ref> studies analyze network traffic at the link level, and thus do not provide strong guidance for how sources should be modeled (though both studies, and also the related [ENW94], offer arguments concerning how source characteristics could lead to link-level self-similarity).
