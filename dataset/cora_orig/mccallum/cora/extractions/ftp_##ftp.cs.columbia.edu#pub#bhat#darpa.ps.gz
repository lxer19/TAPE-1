Abstract: We address the problem of accurate depth estimation using stereo in the presence of specular reflection. Specular reflection is viewpoint dependent and can cause large intensity differences at corresponding points in stereo images. Hence, mismatches could result causing significant depth errors. Our approach seeks to determine a scene independent optimal stereo configuration such that intensity mismatches are limited and depth resolution is maximized, simultaneously. A key feature of this approach is we do not seek to eliminate or avoid specular reflection, but rather minimize its effects on stereo matching. The scheme is general as it is not restricted to specific reflectance models or image correspondence schemes. Experiments on real surfaces confirms its viability.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Stereo is a direct and robust method of obtaining three-dimensional information of the visual world which makes it attractive for a variety of applications like autonomous navigation, cartography and aerial surveying. Depth recovery using stereo <ref> [ Barnard and Fischler, 1982 ] </ref> involves capturing images from different viewpoints 1 , matching corresponding points in the images (known as the correspondence problem), and obtaining scene depth at corresponding points using triangulation 2 . Inherently, the correspondence problem is under-constrained.

Reference-contexts: His approach attempts to relate image intensity profiles to consistent depth profiles of surfaces. Unfortunately, this does not work with complex intensity profiles as the solution involves ill-conditioned numerical systems. To overcome the problem of depth errors due to highlights, Brelstaff and Blake <ref> [ Brelstaff and Blake, 1988 ] </ref> suggested removing them before matching. Removal of highlights is difficult in general and is an active area of research [ Nayar et al., 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: Parameters of interest include camera vergence and baseline (Fig ure 4). Camera vergence <ref> [ Diner and Fender, 1993 ] </ref> is defined as the angle fi between the intersecting optical axes (O 1 V and O 2 V ) of the cameras, and baseline is the distance between the two viewpoints (O 1 and O 2 ). <p> Thus, our objective would be to achieve maximum vergence. To understand this phenomenon, consider a region (called a lozenge <ref> [ Diner and Fender, 1993 ] </ref> ) viewed simultaneously by one pixel on each camera, as shown in Figure 6. Any point in this lozenge will have the same discrete image locations.

Reference-contexts: To solve the problem, the associated Lagrangian and the Kuhn-Tucker's conditions for optimality <ref> [ Kaplan, 1959 ] </ref> must be defined. By eliminating ^s and ^n from the resulting equations, the optimal viewing directions ^v 1 and ^v 2 and hence the optimal vergence opt v (or opt ) can be obtained, either numerically or analytically.

Reference-contexts: It can be broken down to two components a coherent and an incoherent component 3 . Coherent reflection obeys the mirror law of reflection, and accordingly incident light is reflected only in the specular direction. This component is also termed as the specular spike <ref> [ Nayar et al., 1991 ] </ref> . When surface variations are very small in comparison to the wavelength of light, coherent reflection predominates. As the surface gets rougher, the coherent component weakens rapidly and the incoherent component begins to dominate. <p> As the surface gets rougher, the coherent component weakens rapidly and the incoherent component begins to dominate. The incoherent component spreads in directions other than the specular direction, the distribution depending on the roughness of the surface. This component is also termed as the specular lobe <ref> [ Nayar et al., 1991 ] </ref> . We prefer the term specular reflection over surface reflection, because the underlying reflection mechanism of the surface reflection components is mirror-like or specular. <p> Therefore, specular reflection refers to the specular lobe only. It is described by the Torrance-Sparrow model [ Torrance and Sparrow, 1967 ] which is based on geometrical optics <ref> [ Nayar et al., 1991 ] </ref> . The following is a brief description of this model. A surface is viewed as a collection of planar micro-facets, each behaving like a perfect mirror. A variety of surfaces can be modelled using the slope distribution model for the microfacets.

Reference-contexts: We prefer the term diffuse reflection, because it is more widely used in computer vision literature. Diffuse reflection is often assumed to be Lambertian. A Lambertian surface looks equally bright from all viewing directions. However, Oren and Nayar <ref> [ Oren and Nayar, 1994 ] </ref> showed that this assumption is incorrect for rough surfaces. They developed a comprehensive new reflectance model by observing that a surface modelled as a collection of Lambertian facets is not Lambertian when viewed at low magnification, i.e when a pixel includes many facets. <p> Given a pair of stereo images, the intensities at corresponding points are different because each component varies due to the change in viewing direction 4 . The variation in I d can be explained using the model in <ref> [ Oren and Nayar, 1994 ] </ref> . I s varies according to (1). Thus, I 1 t and I 2 t are given by: I 1 d + I 1 t = I 2 s (3) where the superscripts refer to the two images.

Reference-contexts: Our paper deals with accurate depth estimation in the presence of specular reflection. This scheme is useful because most surfaces exhibit specular reflection. Unambiguous intensity matching of individual points (pixels, strictly speaking) is often impossible. Therefore, various search-based strategies have been developed which match regions in the images (area-based) <ref> [ Panton, 1978 ] </ref> , [ Okutomi and Kanade, 1991 ] , [ Han-nah, 1989 ] , or primitives like edges and lines (feature-based). Area-based schemes rely on statistical correlation between regions.

Reference-contexts: Obtaining a closed-form solution for the optimal ver-gence in terms of roughness and relative threshold is not possible. Therefore, we use a numerical tech nique for constrained optimization called the successive quadratic programming algorithm <ref> [ Press et al., 1989 ] </ref> . Using this algorithm, the relationship between v opt , and T =K s is obtained which is shown in Figure 8. The implications of this relationship are: * The optimal vergence increases with roughness. <p> The dots in the graphs represent intensity measurements and the solid line is the total intensity function. Observe that the smoother gift wrapper surface contains a highlight in the center of the image. With non-linear fitting <ref> [ Press et al., 1989 ] </ref> , the roughness values obtained are: a) 3:5 ffi , b) 6:3 ffi , respectively. It can be seen that the gift wrapper surface is smoother.

Reference-contexts: This ratio is invariant to change in viewing direction in the case of smooth diffuse dielectric surfaces. However, the scheme requires two illumination conditions which makes it unattractive for passive stereo, and does not extend to specular surfaces because the ratio loses its property of being viewer independent. Smith <ref> [ Smith, 1986 ] </ref> proposed an elegant alternative to point correspondence. His approach attempts to relate image intensity profiles to consistent depth profiles of surfaces. Unfortunately, this does not work with complex intensity profiles as the solution involves ill-conditioned numerical systems.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we do not deal with smooth surfaces in comparison to the wavelength of the incident light because they rarely occur in real scenes. Therefore, specular reflection refers to the specular lobe only. It is described by the Torrance-Sparrow model <ref> [ Torrance and Sparrow, 1967 ] </ref> which is based on geometrical optics [ Nayar et al., 1991 ] . The following is a brief description of this model. A surface is viewed as a collection of planar micro-facets, each behaving like a perfect mirror. <p> The slope distribution model uses a parameter which represents surface roughness. A smoother surface is characterized by a lower value for . Using this surface model, the specular intensity I s at any point was shown in <ref> [ Torrance and Sparrow, 1967 ] </ref> as: I s = ^n ^v 1 G = min (1; ^v ^ h 2 (^n ^ h)(^n ^s) ) ^v + ^s (1) where ^v, ^s and ^n are unit vectors pointing along the viewing, source and normal directions, respectively.
