Abstract: We establish new uniqueness results for boundary value problems of the superlinear Emden-Fowler type, u 00 (t) + F (t; u) = 0; u(t) &gt; 0; t 2 (a; b), with either a Dirichlet or Neumann condition at each endpoint. The first result extends a known criterion to nonlinear terms that may change sign. The proof uses the theory of differential inequalities, after changing the independent variable to the quantity u. The second result deals with nonlinear functions of the form ct fl u p , c; fl &gt; 0. The proof uses part of a method due to Coffman and employs as an independent variable the quantity t a u for some a &gt; 0. We also look at a special case F (t; u) = t 4 (u 5 + u), not covered by the previous two results. We show that some of the earlier ideas still apply after we work through several rather technical estimates, with the help of the symbolic manipulation software MAPLE.

Reference-contexts: In general, it is hard to establish uniqueness, even in the regular case b &lt; 1. We are not concerned here with "global" uniqueness, as is the case for most classical results such as those given in the monograph by Bernfeld and Lakshmikantham <ref> [1] </ref>, but with uniqueness within the class of positive solutions. Many of the equations we study admit the trivial solution as well as infinitely many other solutions that change sign. <p> Denote ff = w 1 (d). Within the horizontal strip ff u 1 , the graph of w 1 (t) lies to the left of that of u (t). We can rewrite (1.1) using u in <ref> [ff; 1 ] </ref> as the independent variable, and R 1 (u) = OE (t)u 0 (t) and R 2 (u) = OE (t)w 0 1 (t) as we did in the proof of Theorem 1. <p> By the definition of the point o , u 0 (1) = 2 Let us denote u (1) = : (4:7) Then u 0 (1) = 2 21 We first derive an upper bound on By integrating (4.5) twice, first over <ref> [1; s] </ref>; s &lt; 3=2 and then over [1; 3=2], we obtain the identity u (1) = 2 Z 3=2 (3=2 t)t 4 Making use of (4.7) and (4.8), we have = 4 1 u 5 (t) + u (t) dt: (4:10) Concavity implies that in the interval [1; 3=2], u <p> By the definition of the point o , u 0 (1) = 2 Let us denote u (1) = : (4:7) Then u 0 (1) = 2 21 We first derive an upper bound on By integrating (4.5) twice, first over [1; s]; s &lt; 3=2 and then over <ref> [1; 3=2] </ref>, we obtain the identity u (1) = 2 Z 3=2 (3=2 t)t 4 Making use of (4.7) and (4.8), we have = 4 1 u 5 (t) + u (t) dt: (4:10) Concavity implies that in the interval [1; 3=2], u (t) (3 2t). <p> first over [1; s]; s &lt; 3=2 and then over <ref> [1; 3=2] </ref>, we obtain the identity u (1) = 2 Z 3=2 (3=2 t)t 4 Making use of (4.7) and (4.8), we have = 4 1 u 5 (t) + u (t) dt: (4:10) Concavity implies that in the interval [1; 3=2], u (t) (3 2t). <p> Our next step is to obtain an upper bound for oe. Let ff = 1 oe. We need a lower bound on ff. Integrating (4.5) over <ref> [oe; 1] </ref>, we get Z 1 t 4 3 : (4:13) Because of concavity, u (t) in [oe; 1] lies entirely under its tangent line at the point t = 1. The highest point of the tangent line in the interval is directly above t = oe. <p> Our next step is to obtain an upper bound for oe. Let ff = 1 oe. We need a lower bound on ff. Integrating (4.5) over <ref> [oe; 1] </ref>, we get Z 1 t 4 3 : (4:13) Because of concavity, u (t) in [oe; 1] lies entirely under its tangent line at the point t = 1. The highest point of the tangent line in the interval is directly above t = oe.

Reference-contexts: The classical Emden-Fowler equation is obtained from (1.2) and takes the form u 00 (t) + t fl u p (t) = 0; fl 2 (1; 1); p &gt; 1: (1:3) Nehari's work [12] on the equation (1.1) has much influence in later work by Coff-man <ref> [3] </ref> [4], Moroney [11], Wong [17], and others. Wong's excellent survey [16] 2 contains known results for these equations up to 1975. Much development has occurred since then. <p> Kwong [7] showed that the monotonicity of F (t; u) in t is not needed. In Section 2 we improve this result further to allow F (t; u) to change sign. Coffman <ref> [3] </ref> also 3 established uniqueness for (BVP1) with the classical Emden-Fowler equations (1.3). Ni [13] studied equation (1.1) in the form u 00 (t) + t and extended Coffman's results in many directions. The effort was continued by Ni and Nussbaum [14]. <p> We wish to extend this range. For functions with only one term, namely F (t; u) = t fl u p , it is known that (BVP1) has a unique solution for any value of fl (see <ref> [3] </ref>). There is, of course, no reason to believe that such a nice property is preserved when the function is perturbed by a different power of u. We show that at least when the perturbing power is close enough to p, and when fl &gt; 0, uniqueness prevails.

Reference-contexts: For sublinear equations, uniqueness theorems have been obtained by Picard and Urysohn; see [7] for a recent treatment.

The corresponding theory for superlinear equations is richer because uniqueness no longer holds unless some rather technical restrictions are imposed on the coefficients. The most tantalizing fact is that numerical experiments usually show positive results under much less stringent conditions than required by analytic proofs.

We now give a third proof and an extension. The change of variables u (t) = v (t)=t n2 and s = t n2 transforms (1.4) to 1 i v j where k = n . For this equation, [F1] is satisfied with OE (t) = 1, from superlinearity. <p> According to Coffman's method (see Kwong <ref> [7] </ref> for a survey), uniqueness for (BVP1) follows if we can show that w (b) = @fi fi fi &lt; 0: (3:3) The function w (t) satisfies the variational equation, obtained by differentiating (3.1) with respect to fi, w 00 (t) + t fl (5u 4 (t) + 4u 3 (t))w
