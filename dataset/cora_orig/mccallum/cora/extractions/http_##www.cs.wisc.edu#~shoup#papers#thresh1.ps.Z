Title: Securing Threshold Cryptosystems against Chosen Ciphertext Attack  
Author: Victor Shoup Rosario Gennaro 
Abstract: For the most compelling applications of threshold cryptosystems, security against chosen ciphertext attack seems to be a requirement. However, there appear to be no practical threshold cryptosystems in the literature that are provably chosen-ciphertext secure, even in the idealized random hash function model. The contribution of this paper is to present two very practical threshold cryptosystems, and to prove that they are secure against chosen ciphertext attack in the random hash function model.

Reference-contexts: To protect individual privacy, the court order specifies to whom the wiretap applies and a time interval. To enforce this policy, the third party only decrypts a ciphertext if the information in its label is consistent with the given court order. Another example is the recent work of <ref> [1] </ref> on fair exchange. Here, an "off line" trusted third party is used, meaning that the third party is only needed if one of the two trading partners tries 2 to cheat. As above, ciphertexts are labeled to allow the third party to enforce a fairness policy.

Reference-contexts: We cannot expect to do any better for threshold cryptosystems. However, practical non-threshold schemes have been devised in the so-called random hash function, or random oracle, model. This approach, first used by Fiat and Shamir [15], and later given a more rigorous treatment by Bellare and Rogaway <ref> [2] </ref>, works as follows. Suppose that a cryptographic scheme that makes use of hash functions can be proven secure under standard intractability assumptions, but in an idealized model of computation where the hash functions are replaced by "black boxes" that output random strings. <p> Practical schemes. Again in the context of non-threshold cryptosystems, practical cryptosystems intended to be secure against chosen ciphertext attack were proposed by Damgard [8], Zheng and Seberry [28], and Bellare and Rogaway <ref> [2, 3] </ref>.

The schemes in <ref> [28, 2, 3] </ref> are all known to be chosen-ciphertext secure in the random hash function model. <p> To see why, consider the scheme in <ref> [2] </ref>, which is representative. This scheme uses a trapdoor permutation f and hash functions G and H; to encrypt a message m, a random r in the domain of f is chosen, and the ciphertext is (f (r); m G (r); H (r; m)). <p> The proof is in Appendix B. 7 Implementation Issues To implement these schemes, one has to choose concrete hash functions. This is relatively straightforward, but see <ref> [2] </ref> for a detailed discussion. One technicality that we have to deal with here, though, is the hash function H 1 in TDH1, whose output is supposed to be an element of the group G.

Interestingly, one can readily convert all of the impractical schemes mentioned above into secure (but impractical) threshold schemes. It is instructive to see why this is so. All of these schemes use a publicly checkable validity test, which is essentially a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of the plaintext.

In a non-threshold cryptosystem, labeled ciphertexts can be implemented by simply embedding a hash of the label in the cleartext before encrypting. <p> As mentioned above, we must assume that the adversary can see these shares, making the validity test pointless, and giving the adversary the ability to invert f at chosen points. This destroys any hope of proving security using current techniques.
