Abstract: In this paper we give a practical and efficient output-sensitive algorithm for constructing the display of a polyhedral terrain. It runs in O((d + n) log 2 n) time and uses O(nff(n)) space, where d is the size of the final display, and ff(n) is a (very slowly growing) functional inverse of Ackermann's function. Our implementation is especially simple and practical, because we try to take full advantage of the specific geometrical properties of the terrain. The asymptotic speed of our algorithm has been improved upon theoretically by other authors, but at the cost of higher space usage and/or high overhead and complicated code. Our main data structure maintains an implicit representation of the convex hull of a set of points that can be dynamically updated in O(log 2 n) time. It is especially simple and fast in our application since there are no rebalancing operations required in the tree.
