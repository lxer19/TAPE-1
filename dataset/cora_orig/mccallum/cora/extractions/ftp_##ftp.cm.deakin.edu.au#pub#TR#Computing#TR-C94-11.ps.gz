Title: COGNITIVE VIEWS ON THE SYSTEMS ANALYSIS FUNCTION

Abstract: The role of systems analysis has changed dramatically in the last ten years because of changes to organisational structures and the complexity of the systems now required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing environment and establishing strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding of process and change management. This position paper introduces our preliminary research findings into a requirements elicitation process model, which will attempt to address some of the problems requirements analysts are having today and why current methods are proving to be inadequate. The model will include the use of a critical success factor analysis of the process. The development of scenarios with attached ontologies is expected to provide the basis for prototyping, subject to concurrent evaluation.
