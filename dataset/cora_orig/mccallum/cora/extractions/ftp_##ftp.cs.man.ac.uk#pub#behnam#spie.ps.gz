Abstract: Fractal coding of digital images offers many promising qualities. However the coding process suffers from the long search time of the domain block pool. In this paper, we obtain mathematical results on the distance measure used in the search. Then we derive an incremental procedure to bound the domain block pixels. We arrange the domain blocks in a tree structure, and utilise the procedure to direct the search. We show that this method speeds up the coding process by upto 50 times, without noticeable loss of image quality. Our procedure works in conjunction with other methods, such as block classification.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently fractal compression of digital images has attracted much attention. It is based on the mathematical theory of iterated function systems (IFS) developed by Hutchinson <ref> [1] </ref> and Barnsley [2]. Its use for image compression was proposed by Jacquin in [3], [4] and Barnsley. Other variants of the IFS compression method have been reported in the literature, eg [5].

Self similarity is the key to the fractal idea. We use the Jacquin method <ref> [3] </ref>, but allow a linear offset term as in [10]. The Jacquin method is investigated further by Jacobs et al. [9]. The image is a digital grey level picture. We cover it by non-overlapping square range blocks of size n fi n, where normally n = 4.

Two types of methods have been investigated. The methods in the first category classify image blocks in some way. A range block is compared against the domain blocks of the same class. Originally, Jacquin <ref> [4] </ref> classified blocks on their edge content. Later, Jacobs et al. [9] used block brightness orientation. The other methods, eg [5], search a smaller pool of domain blocks, but rely on a richer set of transformations, eg polynomial translation terms. <p> The map T is contracting if a 0 &lt; 1. However, Jacobs et al. [9] show that it is not necessary to enforce this condition for all the maps. The offset g ij is a constant in the original paper of Jacquin <ref> [4] </ref>. Later researchers used more general forms. For instance, [10] suggests a linear term in the indices i; j:- g ij = a 1 + a 2 i + a 3 j Our method works with either form of g. <p> Let A or B refer to a domain or a range block after these operations. Given B, we must find a block A with the minimum d (A; B). We know that d (A; B) jBj 2 , for any block A. However, according to the collage theorem <ref> [4] </ref>, the compression fidelity relies on the fact that some A will give a much smaller minimum difference. In fact, the distribution of the ratio jBj 2 = min d (A; B) relates to the fittness of the collage.

Monro and Dudbridge <ref> [5] </ref> set g ij to a third degree polynomial in i; j, but used a very restricted set of domain blocks. The constants in the massic map are chosen to minimise the distance from the (contracted flipped) domain block D to the range block R = (r ij ).

Reference-contexts: Provided the transformations are contracting, the images converge to a stable image, resembling the original picture. The fractal method offers high compression ratio, good image quality, and resolution independence of the decoded image. Its disadvantage lies in the long search time for domain blocks.

The methods in the first category classify image blocks in some way. A range block is compared against the domain blocks of the same class.
