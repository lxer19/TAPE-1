Author: Elizabeth Bradley and Douglas E. Straub 
Affiliation: University of Colorado  
Abstract: In this paper, we present and discuss some circuit experiments that verify our previous claims, which were based on numerical simulations of mathematical models, that chaos can be used to broaden the capture range of the common phase-locked loop circuit.

Reference-contexts: An early instance of innovative and intentional use of chaos in electronic systems was Pecora and Carroll's work on synchronized chaos and its use as a communications technique [4, 12]. Several schemes that exploit chaos to effect design improvements in circuits | the phase-locked loop <ref> [2] </ref>, associative and random-access memory [1], and the delta-sigma modulator [13], among others | have been proposed in the last few years. This paper presents some experimental results that verify the theoretical analysis and numerical experiments in the first of those four applications. <p> Overall, the results were consistent with our previous predictions <ref> [2] </ref> | this technique can indeed effectively broaden the capture range of the circuit. We verified the effects over several hundred trials under a variety of conditions. <p> Both effects are discussed in detail in section 3. 2 The next section briefly outlines the theory of the phase-locked loop and presents some corroborating results on chaos and modulation in the circuit. The theoretical and numerical analysis of this system appears in a previous paper <ref> [2] </ref> and is not duplicated here. The following section explores chaotic lock and capture in more detail. 2 Chaotic Behavior of the Phase-Locked Loop The block diagram of the phase-locked loop (PLL) used here is shown in figure 1. <p> The mathematics of this system and of its chaotic behavior, summarized in this section, are covered in more detail in <ref> [2] </ref>. The phase difference between the reference input v R (t) and the output v O (t) of the circuit's internal voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is measured, filtered, and used to drive the output frequency of the VCO in the direction that minimizes and synchronizes the output and input frequencies. <p> The VCO input voltage and the PD output voltage are the state variables of the system. Phase detectors can take on a variety of forms. We chose the sample-and-hold (S&H), described in detail in <ref> [2] </ref> and in [5]. This circuit has significant advantages and drawbacks: it is common in the literature and yields clear oscilloscope photos, but is difficult to analyze. The simple mixer is common in textbooks, much easier to analyze, and difficult to observe in the phase space. <p> The nonlinear transfer function of the S&H PD is significantly more complicated; see <ref> [2] </ref> for more details. If the input frequency to a locked loop is changed smoothly and slowly, lock can be maintained out to the edges of the lock or tracking range, ! L , which is generally determined by the hard limits of the VCO. <p> As either the modulation frequency or amplitude is raised, analysis and simulations <ref> [2] </ref> predict bifurcations to higher-order limit cycles, followed by chaotic behavior. Part (b) of figure 5 shows a photograph of the circuit after such a bifurcation has occurred, causing the period-one limit cycle of part (a) to become a period-two limit cycle 2 . <p> The close corroboration of numerical and analytical predictions and experimental results verifies our previous statements about the robustness of the approach, which also extends to the equations: the circuit model used to derive the equations in <ref> [2] </ref> subsumed a variety of assumptions: for example, that the reference input, modulating input, and VCO output are pure tones at fixed amplitudes, that the PD is effectively linear in the VCO's range, etc. None of these assumptions appear to have affected the success of the predicted outcome.

Reference-contexts: Because chaotic attractors occupy nonzero phase-space volumes, and because they respond in at least partially predictable ways to changes in parameters, this task is not difficult; in fact, it has been automated in a computer program that uses computer vision, geometric phase-portrait analysis, and other artificial intelligence-based techniques <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> of the stability implied by the shadowing lemma [11, page 251], informally stated thus: "with high probability, the sample paths of the problem with external noise follow some orbit of the deterministic system closely [6]."

The criterion used to classify chaos was the presence of apparent fractal phase-space structure 4 . A bank of comparators was programmed to detect when the state of the circuit neared each capture point, to within the three tolerances listed in table 2.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar in spirit to some existing aided acquisition techniques, such as Gilchriest's use of random noise to cause the state of an unlocked circuit to "hunt" around for an otherwise-unaccessible target point <ref> [10] </ref>. Our approach is different in that it uses deterministic dynamics, wherein the introduced signal and its effects on the phase-space structure can be predicted and analyzed.

Reference-contexts: This extreme sensitivity, however, is not uniformly disadvantageous.
