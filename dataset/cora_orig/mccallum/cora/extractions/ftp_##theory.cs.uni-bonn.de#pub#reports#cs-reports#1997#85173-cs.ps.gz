Abstract: Using a modification of Wilkie's recent proof of o-minimality for Pfaffian functions, we gave an invariant characterization of o-minimal expansions of IR. We apply this to construct the Pfaffian closure of an arbitrary o-minimal expansion of IR. fl Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, and the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, California.

Reference-contexts: Let S be a tame IR-system. Then there is a smallest IR-system extending S and closed under [; 9; LC. This system is tame. We propose to call it Ch (S), the Charbonel closure of S, in recognition of the insights in <ref> [C91] </ref>. 1.8 Ch (S) has some agreeable topological and measure-theoretic properties. Let be Lebesque measure, and n the corresponding product measure IR n . Then, easily, every set in (Ch (S)) n is n -measurable. Moreover, any set in (Ch (S)) n with no interior has measure 0.

Reference-contexts: Definition: S is o-minimal if every A 2 S, has finite boundary. Most remarkably, one knows: Theorem: <ref> [D97] </ref> If S is o-minimal then for every A 2 S k+l , b 0 ( ~ fi) is bounded uniformly for ~ fi 2 IR l (cf. x1.5). 5 If then S contains the semilinear sets, (T4) holds. <p> Proof: Here we start using substantial facts about o-minimality. Fix j, and let S consist of &gt; and all total C j functions in S 0 . We claim S 0 = T arski (S). By <ref> [D97] </ref>, every A in S 0 is a finite union of cells. So we have only to show that cells are in T arski (S). This is now done by induction, following the inductive definition of cell in [D97]. <p> We claim S 0 = T arski (S).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we go further, in particular removing, exactly to the extent to which this is possible, Wilkie's C 1 assumption. Wilkie used Sard, but not Morse. We use both, and an important recent result of van den Dries and Miller <ref> [DM96] </ref> (which abstracts an important result of Bierstone, Milman and Pawlucki). <p> For M based on C 1 primitives this is quite easy, using Wilkie, plus Sard and Morse in Khovanski's style. To do it without the C 1 assumption needed a new idea, coming from <ref> [DM96] </ref>. Then, having achieved this objective, we realized that we had obtained a nice characterization of o-minimal expansions of the real field. In this paper we reverse the order of discovery. The characterization is Theorem 4 below. <p> A Tarski system on X is closed under the usual primitives of first order logic, and is in fact no more than a sequence hS n i such that for some language L and L-structure on X, S n is the collection of definable subsets of X n <ref> [DM96] </ref>. Note that complement (or negation) was not involved in the discussion through x1.7 . <p> Also, the connected components of A ~ fi are in S, when S is o-minimal. For a beautiful survey of the many important consequences of o-minimality, see <ref> [DM96] </ref>. 1.11 It is of course trivial that tame Tarski systems on IR are o-minimal. But one now knows deep results that go from tame S to o-minimal Ch (S), and we now turn to them. Recall our convention that functions are (unless otherwise specified) identified with relations. <p> In Case 1, consider the closed set A. By a crucial result of <ref> [DM96] </ref>, A is the zero set of a total C j function in S 0 , and so A is in T arski (S). But A = A " (B fi IR), so is in T arski (S). <p> Clearly A is definable from these and &lt;. 2 2.3 The Zero Set Condition. We have just seen that any o-minimal S 0 is generated, for any j 0, by &gt; and a set of total C j functions. We made crucial use of the following result <ref> [DM96] </ref> (inspired by unpublished work of Bierstone, Milman and Pawlucki): Theorem 3: If S 0 is o-minimal, and A is a closed set in S, then for each j 0, A is the zeroset of some total C j f in S 0 . This now suggests our main definition. <p> It is o-minimal, by Theorem 21. 6 Concluding Remarks 6.1 Until Wilkie's recent work, the exponential played a special role among transcendental Pfaffian functions not realanalytic at 1. (It still does vis-a-vis model completeness). Until recently the system IR an;exp was the largest known o-minimal system <ref> [DM96, DMM94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If one adds exp to (1) one gets the i function on (1; 1) definable, and if one adds exp to (2) one gets the function on (1; 1) definable. By our Theorem the Pfaffian closure of both systems is o-minimal. (Van den Dries <ref> [DS97] </ref>, in work completed before ours, showed that adding exp to a (model-complete) o-minimal theory containing the restricted exponential preserves o-minimality (and model completeness), so the o-minimality of i, and of , is due to van den Dries and Speissegger). <p> Euler considered the function g (x) = 0 1 + xt which has asymptotic expansion P i x near +1.

Reference-contexts: 0 Introduction While working on complexity questions for V C-dimension of general neural networks and corresponding semi-Pfaffian sets [KM97a], we became convinced that major progress on o-minimality should come from a more systematic use of Sard's Theorem and Morse Theory <ref> [H76] </ref>. The importance of these for Khovanski's basic work [K91] is clear. <p> Note that we do not assume the f i are C 1 , far less real analytic. 5.4 The step from Khovanski Finiteness for systems H : IR n ! IR n , to the uniform bounds on connected components of zerosets, goes via Morse theory. See, for example, <ref> [H76] </ref>, [T86]. Suppose we have functions Q i (x; f 0 (x); : : : ; f k1 (x)) as before, but now 1 i m say. We consider X = 1im By taking the sums of the squares of the Q i , we can assume m = 1. <p> Assume this, and replace Q 1 by Q 1 * for a regular value * in the image of Q 1 (always possible unless X = IR n ). Then X is a manifold, and one easily uses the Morse inequalities <ref> [H76] </ref> (against a linear Morse function) to bound the number of connected components (and even the sum of Betti numbers) by an upper bound for the number of nonsingular solutions of F = 0 @x i 1 . . . @x i n1 where F (x 1 ; : : : <p> If k = 0, we get this from the o-minimality of i. We now induct on k. The Morse argument (which needs a generic linear Morse function) takes place in the category of C 2 manifolds <ref> [H76] </ref>. Because of the Zero Set Condition, we can, in (#), assume as much differentiability of the Q (but not the P ij !) as the problem requires.

Reference-contexts: 0 Introduction While working on complexity questions for V C-dimension of general neural networks and corresponding semi-Pfaffian sets [KM97a], we became convinced that major progress on o-minimality should come from a more systematic use of Sard's Theorem and Morse Theory [H76]. The importance of these for Khovanski's basic work <ref> [K91] </ref> is clear. Our result was strongly confirmed by Wilkie's 1996 result [W96] on the o-minimality of expansions of the real field by C 1 primitives, provided that the (necessary) condition holds that all quantifier-free definable sets have finitely many connected components, uniformly in parameters. <p> contains every semi-algebraic subset of IR n (and in particular every singleton); (T3) For every n and A 2 S n there exists m n and a closed B 2 S m with A = m;n [B]. (T4) has to do with the type of finiteness condition found by Khovanski <ref> [K91] </ref>, which was so inspirational for Wilkie's breakthrough in [W94]. Suppose A IR k+l , and ~ fi 2 IR l . Let A ~ fi = fx : (x; ~ fi) 2 Ag IR k . <p> Let A ~ fi = fx : (x; ~ fi) 2 Ag IR k . Give A ~ fi the subspace topology, and let b o ( ~ fi) = number of connected components of A ~ fi . Following <ref> [K91] </ref> we are interested in situations where b o ( ~ fi) is bounded independently of ~ fi. <p> But obviously this is the same notion as zeroset of n affine functions]. Khovanski proved that (T4) holds for any semi-Pfaffian set <ref> [K91] </ref>, and (T1) - (T3) are trivial in this situation. <p> Proof: Obvious. 2 Corollary: T arski ((S; &lt;)) is model complete if and only if the closure of any existentially definable set is existentially definable. 5 Pfaffian Closure 5.1 Let us first recall Khovanski's definition of Pfaffian chain, and Pfaf-fian function <ref> [K91] </ref>. <p> Of fundamental importance is Khovanski's Theorem <ref> [K91] </ref> which can be (re)written as: The class of Pfaffian functions has the property of uniform H 0 -bounds. It follows easily that the IR-system generated from all Zer (f ) and P os (f ), f Pfaffian, using ^ and _, is tame. <p> Again following <ref> [K91] </ref> one considers the map (F 1 ; : : : ; F n ; G) (= (F; G)) from IR n+1 to IR n+1 , where F i (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ; x n+1 ) = Q i (x 1 ; : : : <p> Let us just assume we have Sard somehow for C 1 F . Let a be a regular value for F , and consider the compact curve a = F 1 (a). a is a submanifold of IR n . As in <ref> [K91] </ref>, one now defines a vector field in IR n+1 by: The derivative of a C 1 function on IR n+1 along is the Jacobian of (F; ). Then a is tangent to , and does not vanish on a . <p> Now one attempts induction by considering the systems, based on a shorter chain: F = ff ) for arbitrary ff; fi (as parameters). If N is a bound for the number of regular points in (F; ^|) 1 (ff; fi), it follows as in <ref> [K91] </ref> that for any fl 2 IR, there are at most N regular points in (^|) 1 (fl). Then, as in [K91] we get that g has N zeroes. So there are N points where F = ff; G = 0. <p> If N is a bound for the number of regular points in (F; ^|) 1 (ff; fi), it follows as in <ref> [K91] </ref> that for any fl 2 IR, there are at most N regular points in (^|) 1 (fl). Then, as in [K91] we get that g has N zeroes. So there are N points where F = ff; G = 0. So ( ~ F ) 1 (ff) has N points. <p> Pfaffian chain in more variables, so we can assume x = ( ~ ~y; ~w) and we are dealing only with conjunctions of conditions Q ~ ~y; ~w; f 0 ( ~ ~y; ~w); : : : ; f k1 ( ~ ~y; ~w) = 0 Now, as in Khovanskii <ref> [K91] </ref>, we will proceed by induction on k. In [K91] the induction is for systems of m equations in m unknowns, and nonsingular solutions (which are of course isolated). <p> x = ( ~ ~y; ~w) and we are dealing only with conjunctions of conditions Q ~ ~y; ~w; f 0 ( ~ ~y; ~w); : : : ; f k1 ( ~ ~y; ~w) = 0 Now, as in Khovanskii <ref> [K91] </ref>, we will proceed by induction on k. In [K91] the induction is for systems of m equations in m unknowns, and nonsingular solutions (which are of course isolated). For any given k one uses the latter result, for k, to deal with the case of components of generated systems with the same k, using Morse Theory.

Reference-contexts: Proof: (T1) and (T2) are clear. (T3) is essentially the observation y &gt; 0 , (9u; v)(y v 2 = 0 ^ u v 1 = 0) and is an old idea going back to <ref> [T51] </ref>. (T4) is an easy consequence of Clause 4, the presence of linear functions, and that the union of two sets each with finitely many connected components has finitely many connected components. 2 Corollary: Ch (T [ ) is tame.

Reference-contexts: The point of Wilkie's formulation of (T4) rather than the version discussed earlier is that it is useful in inductive arguments (where he makes ingenious use of it). 4 1.7 Wilkie shows that the class of tame IR-systems is closed under [; 9; LC <ref> [W95] </ref>. Let S be a tame IR-system. Then there is a smallest IR-system extending S and closed under [; 9; LC. This system is tame. <p> Then, easily, every set in (Ch (S)) n is n -measurable. Moreover, any set in (Ch (S)) n with no interior has measure 0. And, finally, if a set in (Ch (S)) n has no interior its closure has measure 0, and in particular no interior. See <ref> [W95] </ref>. 1.9 Tarski systems After these rather nontrivial considerations, we return temporarily to generalities. X will be again a nonempty set. <p> Let be a k-modulus such that @A B ( mod ). Then there is in (Ch (S)) n a closed set C with empty interior such that @A C. Proof: [W96] 2 The problem is how, given A, and seeking C, one constructs B (evidently, by <ref> [W95] </ref>, one needs only that B is in Ch (S)). Wilkie uses a C 1 assumption. We are going to use the assumption that S = T [ , for T an o-minimal generator.

Reference-contexts: The importance of these for Khovanski's basic work [K91] is clear. Our result was strongly confirmed by Wilkie's 1996 result <ref> [W96] </ref> on the o-minimality of expansions of the real field by C 1 primitives, provided that the (necessary) condition holds that all quantifier-free definable sets have finitely many connected components, uniformly in parameters. A striking consequence is the o-minimality of the Pfaffian C 1 -structure on IR. <p> If n m, and oe is the inclusion, oe fl is the usual projection m;n : X m ! X n . 1.4 As in <ref> [W96] </ref> our basic objects are X-systems, i.e. sequences hS n i n2! , where S n is a set of subsets of X n . A is in S if A is in some S n . <p> It then follows that if A 2 S n and B 2 S m then A fi B 2 S n+m <ref> [W96] </ref>. Wilkie defines two operations on X-systems, and shows that the class of pure X-systems is closed under both. <p> Let S LC n consist of all A 1 " A 2 " " A r , A i 2 S n , and S LC = hS LC n i (LC stands for local closure). Then Wilkie showed that S S LC , and LC preserves purity <ref> [W96] </ref>. 3 1.6 Finally we go to X = IR, with the order topology, and to what Wilkie calls tame systems. There are four axioms (T1) - (T4), of which only the last requires discussion. <p> Note that complement (or negation) was not involved in the discussion through x1.7 . The extraordinary fact is that under some mild assumptions on tame IR-systems S, Ch (S) is a Tarski system <ref> [W96] </ref>. 1.10 o-minimality on IR Let S be a Tarski system on IR, with the graph of &gt; in S 2 . Definition: S is o-minimal if every A 2 S, has finite boundary. <p> Definition: (0 j 1) An IR-system S is C j if its members are either &gt; or C j total functions. Finally: Theorem 1: <ref> [W96] </ref>. Let S be a C 1 IR-system, such that P ure (S) is tame. Then Ch (S) = T arski (S) and is o-minimal. <p> The passage from (*) to our conclusion (closure under complement for Ch (T [ )) does not need any differentiability assumptions. But the proof of (the analogue of) (*) in Wilkie <ref> [W96] </ref> uses a C 1 assumption. We will get by with the ZeroSet Condition. We get from T to Ch (T [ ) by iteration of [; 9 and LC, and (*) will be proved via an induction on how A is generated. <p> Suppose n m 1, and F : U ! IR m is a C 1 function, where U is open in IR n and U and F are in S. Then the set of nonregular values of F is in Ch (S), and has measure 0. Proof: See <ref> [W96] </ref> and x1.7. 2 And similarly: Theorem 8: Suppose S is a tame IR-System. Let n &gt; m 1, a 2 IR m . Suppose F : IR n ! IR m and f : IR n ! IR are in S and C 1 . <p> Proof: <ref> [W96] </ref> 2 4 Approximation Theory 4.1 We now follow Wilkie in setting up definitions and a goal for approx imation theory, but we will prove a different result. 4.2 Definition: (as in [W96]) (i) IR + = fx 2 IR : x &gt; 0g; (ii) (k 2 IN) A k-modulus is <p> Proof: <ref> [W96] </ref> 2 4 Approximation Theory 4.1 We now follow Wilkie in setting up definitions and a goal for approx imation theory, but we will prove a different result. 4.2 Definition: (as in [W96]) (i) IR + = fx 2 IR : x &gt; 0g; (ii) (k 2 IN) A k-modulus is a sequence = h 0 ; : : : ; k i with 0 2 IR + , and i : IR i (iii) If is a k-modulus, and * = h* <p> i) and every ~x in A with k~xk &lt; * 1 0 there is ~y in IR n with k~x ~yk &lt; * 0 and h~y; * 1 ; : : : ; * k i 2 B. 4.3 The main use of the above notions comes from Lemma 13: <ref> [W96] </ref>. (S tame). Suppose n 1, k 2 IN, A 2 S n , B 2 S n+k and B has empty interior. Let be a k-modulus such that @A B ( mod ). <p> Let be a k-modulus such that @A B ( mod ). Then there is in (Ch (S)) n a closed set C with empty interior such that @A C. Proof: <ref> [W96] </ref> 2 The problem is how, given A, and seeking C, one constructs B (evidently, by [W95], one needs only that B is in Ch (S)). Wilkie uses a C 1 assumption. We are going to use the assumption that S = T [ , for T an o-minimal generator. <p> Remarks: (i) In the above, let f = (f 1 ; : : : ; f k ). Suppose also l 1. Then the set of nonregular values " for f has measure zero, and is in Ch (T [ ). This is because of <ref> [W96] </ref>; (ii) In the above, B has no interior [W96]; (iii) In the above, B is in Ch (T [ ), obviously. 12 4.5 The main result Theorem 14: (S an o-minimal generator). <p> Suppose also l 1. Then the set of nonregular values " for f has measure zero, and is in Ch (T [ ). This is because of <ref> [W96] </ref>; (ii) In the above, B has no interior [W96]; (iii) In the above, B is in Ch (T [ ), obviously. 12 4.5 The main result Theorem 14: (S an o-minimal generator). <p> Once we have proved this, there will follow, exactly as in <ref> [W96] </ref>, Corollary: (S an o-minimal generator). Ch (S) =T arski (S), and is o-minimal. The theorem is proved by induction essentially on the construction of A in Ch (S). In the previous discussion we have worked over T [ , since it is tame. <p> We now list the essential modules involved. (1) If A 1 ; : : : ; A r have the property for l, so does A 1 [ [ A r . This is obvious, and something similar is done in <ref> [W96] </ref>. (2) If A IR n+1 , and has the (l + 1)-property, then [A] has the l-property, where : IR n+1 ! IR n is the projection onto the first n coordinates. This is (essentially) done in 3.10 of [W96], and uses the fact that S contains 0 @ 1 <p> This is obvious, and something similar is done in <ref> [W96] </ref>. (2) If A IR n+1 , and has the (l + 1)-property, then [A] has the l-property, where : IR n+1 ! IR n is the projection onto the first n coordinates. This is (essentially) done in 3.10 of [W96], and uses the fact that S contains 0 @ 1 + i=n+1 i A 2 all n, k, and is an algebra closed under any partials which exist. We stress that this module requires work, done in [W96]. 13 (3) Suppose f in S, and A = Zer (f ). <p> This is (essentially) done in 3.10 of <ref> [W96] </ref>, and uses the fact that S contains 0 @ 1 + i=n+1 i A 2 all n, k, and is an algebra closed under any partials which exist. We stress that this module requires work, done in [W96]. 13 (3) Suppose f in S, and A = Zer (f ). Then A has the l-property for all l. Here we use critically the ZeroSet Condition, to get A = Zer (g), g in S, g C l . <p> Here we use critically the ZeroSet Condition, to get A = Zer (g), g in S, g C l . Then use also that 0 n X x 2 ! 1 x 2 1 1 is in S, all n. Then the argument in 3.8 of <ref> [W96] </ref> works. (4) If A is in T , A has the l-property, all l. The basic idea is that for f in S, P os (f ) is the projection of some Zer (g), g in S. Thus A in T is also of this form. <p> Thus A in T is also of this form. Now use modules (2) and (3). (5) If A is in T [ , A has the l-property, all l. Use modules (4) and (1). (6) Now we use a cunning idea of Wilkie <ref> [W96] </ref>. Suppose A IR n has the l-property. Let Y be an (n 1)-dimensional affine subspace of IR n , such that A " Y = @(A) " Y . Then A " Y has the l-property.
