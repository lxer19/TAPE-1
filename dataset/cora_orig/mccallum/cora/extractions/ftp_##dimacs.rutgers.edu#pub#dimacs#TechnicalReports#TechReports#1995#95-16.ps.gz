Reference-contexts: Such triangles have been studied by Harborth [6] and Chang <ref> [1] </ref>. Steinhaus graphs are named in honor of Hugo Steinhaus who has asked in [9] whether there is a zero-one sequence of length n (for n 0 or 3 (mod 4)) which generates a Steinhaus triangle with the same number of zeros and ones.

Reference-contexts: The question has been answered affirmatively by H. Harborth [6]. Properties of Steinhaus graphs and their complements have been extensively studied <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] </ref>. In particular W. Dymacek [5] has studied bipartite Steinhaus graphs and shown that a Steinhaus graph is bipartite if and only if it has no triangles. He has also given a loose upper bound on the number of such graphs on n vertices.

Corollary 2.4 (Dymacek <ref> [5] </ref>) A Steinhaus graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain a triangle. 3 The number of bipartite Steinhaus graphs. Let b (n) denote the number of bipartite Steinhaus graphs on n vertices. We want to study this function. <p> We want to study this function. We will present an explicit expression allowing to compute b (n) in time O (log n). Furthermore, we show linear upper and lower bounds for b (n). Previous results by Dymacek <ref> [5] </ref> showed that n + 1 b (n) and b (n) 50 2 n24 for n 24. The first inequality corresponds to the bipartite Steinhaus graphs with zero, one or n 1 1's in the sequence D. <p> The second inequality has been obtained from the recurrence relation b (n + 1) 2b (n) and the computation of b (n) for n 24 by exhaustive search. Table 1 <ref> [5] </ref> shows b (n) for a few more values of n.
