Abstract: The problem of optimally approximating a function with a linear expansion over a redundant dictionary of waveforms is NP-hard. The greedy matching pursuit algorithm and its orthog-onalized variant produce sub-optimal function expansions by iteratively choosing dictionary waveforms that best match the function's structures. A matching pursuit provides a means of quickly computing compact, adaptive function approximations. Numerical experiments show that the approximation errors from matching pursuits initially decrease rapidly, but the asymptotic decay rate of the errors is slow. We explain this behavior by showing that matching pursuits are chaotic, ergodic maps. The statistical properties of the approximation errors of a pursuit can be obtained from the invariant measure of the pursuit. We characterize these measures using group symmetries of dictionaries and by constructing a stochastic differential equation model. We derive a notion of the coherence of a signal with respect to a dictionary from our characterization of the approximation errors of a pursuit. The dictionary elements selected during the initial iterations of a pursuit correspond to a function's coherent structures. The tail of the expansion, on the other hand, corresponds to a noise which is characterized by the invariant measure of the pursuit map. When using a suitable dictionary, the expansion of a function into its coherent structures yields a compact approximation. We demonstrate a denoising algorithm based on coherent function expansions.

Reference-contexts: Finding M-optimal approximations for general dictionaries is a much more difficult problem. We briefly introduce some basic concepts from complexity theory in order to characterize the difficulty of the M-optimal approximation problem. Further details may be found in [13] and <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.1 NP-completeness A concrete problem is a map from a set of problem instances to a set of solutions. An instance of a concrete problem is a binary string which specifies all parameters and input data for the problem. <p> A very important class of decision problems is the complexity class NP. The class NP consists of the set of problems for which solutions can be verified (but not necessarily solved) in polynomial time. This is a less standard definition from <ref> [4] </ref> but is simpler than and equivalent to the more commonly used definition of [13]. The verification process makes use of outside information, called a certificate which is not in general available to the algorithm computing the solution. A well-known problem in NP is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). <p> The optimality factor ff is set to 1. The matching pursuit is initialized by computing the inner products f&lt; f; g fl &gt;g fl2 . These inner products are stored in an open hash table <ref> [4] </ref>, where they are partially sorted. The algorithm is defined by induction as follows. Suppose that we have already computed f&lt; R n f; g fl &gt;g fl2 , for n 0.

Reference-contexts: The dictionary of time-frequency atoms D = fg fl (t)g fl2 is a very redundant set of functions that includes both window Fourier frames and wavelet frames <ref> [5] </ref>. When the window function g is the Gaussian g (t) = 2 1=4 e t 2 , the resulting time-frequency atoms are Gabor functions, 13 and have optimal localization in time and in frequency. <p> Property (50) is satisfied for the Gabor dictionary and the group G composed of dilations, translations, and modulations for H = L 2 (R). This comes from our ability to construct frames of L 2 (R) through translations and dilations or frequency modulations of Gaussian functions <ref> [5] </ref>. Proposition 4.2 implies that there exists a choice function such that matching pursuits with a Gabor dictionary commute with dilations, translations, and frequency modulations.

Reference-contexts: Because of the difficulty of computing optimal expansions, we turn to suboptimal algorithms. In section 3 we review the performance of greedy algorithms, called matching pursuits, that were introduced in [24] <ref> [7] </ref>. We describe a fast implementation of these algorithms, and we give numerical examples for a dictionary composed of waveforms that are well-localized in time and frequency. Such dictionaries are particularly important for audio signal processing. <p> In H 2 , the orthogonal complement of H 1 in H, we construct a (0; ff 2 N n)-approximation problem which has a unique solution. The combined approximation problem in H will be equivalent to the exact cover problem and will have the requisite M and dictionary size <ref> [7] </ref>. The optimal approximation criterion of definition 2.1 has number of undesirable properties which are responsible for its NP-completeness. The elements contained in the expansions are unstable in that functions which are only slightly different can have optimal expansions containing completely different dictionary elements. <p> This happens when the family of selected elements is not a Riesz basis of the closed space it generates. In <ref> [7] </ref> it is proved that it is indeed possible for the set fg fl k g of 11 vectors selected by an orthogonal pursuit to be degenerate, even when the dictionary contains an orthonormal basis. The residuals of orthogonal matching pursuits in general decrease faster than the non-orthogonal matching pursuits. <p> For dictionaries corresponding to a finite cyclic group, such as the group of unit translations modulo N , we can obtain group invariant decompositions for all functions in a complex space H if and only if the dictionary contains all eigenvectors of the group operators G t <ref> [7] </ref>. This result cannot be extended to groups generated by two non-commuting elements, such as the set of all unit translations and modulations, because non-commuting operators have different eigenvectors. <p> In order to implement a de-noising scheme with a matching pursuit, it is essential that the dictionary be well-adapted to decomposing the portion of signals we wish to retain and poorly-adapted to decomposing that portion we wish to discard. In <ref> [7] </ref> an algorithm is described for optimizing a dictionary so that the coherence of signals of interest can be maximized. <p> Our experiments also show that the expansions produced by both pursuits are well-conditioned for the coherent portions of signals. Although <ref> [7] </ref> showed that it is possible for stability problems to occur with orthogonal pursuits, we do not observe instabilities in our experiments. 7.1 Accuracy of Non-orthogonal and Orthogonal Pursuit Approximations To compare the performance of the orthogonal and non-orthogonal pursuits, we segmented a digitized speech recording into 512-sample pieces and decomposed <p> When the selected set of dictionary elements is degenerate (when the set does not form a Riesz basis for the space it spans), these expansions cannot be converted into expansions over the dictionary elements g fl . In <ref> [7] </ref> it is proved that it is indeed possible for the set fg fl k g of vectors selected by an orthogonal pursuit to be degenerate, even when the dictionary contains an orthonormal basis.

We can greatly improve these approximations to f by enlarging the collection fg fl g fl2 beyond a basis.
