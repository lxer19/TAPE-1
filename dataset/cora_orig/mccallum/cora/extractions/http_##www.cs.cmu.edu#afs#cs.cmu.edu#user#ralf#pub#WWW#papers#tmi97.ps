Title: Automated Dictionary Extraction for "Knowledge-Free" Example-Based Translation

Abstract: An Example-Based Machine Translation system is supplied with a sentence-aligned bilingual corpus, but no other knowledge sources. Using the knowledge implicit in the corpus, it generates a bilingual word-for-word dictionary for alignment during translation. With such an automatically-generated dictionary, the system covers (with equivalent quality) more of its input on unseen texts than the same system does when provided with a manually-created general-purpose dictionary and other knowledge sources.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, only one knowledge source other than the corpus itself is absolutely required for PanEBMT to operate: a large bilingual dictionary (see also Table 1). Statistical MT work such as that of <ref> [P. Brown et al, 1988] </ref> demonstrated many years ago that it is possible to generate a corpus-based dictionary with a considerable degree of accuracy, so an obvious improvement to PanEBMT was to have it create its own dictionary from its corpus.
