Abstract: Suppose not, then there is a negative cost cycle in G(x fl ). But then we can augment flow along that cycle and get a new feasible flow of lower cost, which is a contradiction. Theorem 17.3 (Optimality condition 2) A feasible flow x fl is optimal iff there exist node potential such that c ij 0 for each arc (i,j) in G(x fl ). Proof: ( direction. If c ij 0 for each arc (i,j) in G(x fl ), then in particular for any cycle C in G(x fl ), P (i;j)2C c ij . Thus every cycle's cost is nonnegative. From optimality condition 1 it follows that x fl is optimal. ) direction. x fl is optimal, thus (Opt cond 1) there is no negative cost cycle in G(x fl ). Let d(i) be the shortest paths distances from node 1 (say). Let the node potentials be i = d(i). From the validity of distance labels it follows that, ij =
