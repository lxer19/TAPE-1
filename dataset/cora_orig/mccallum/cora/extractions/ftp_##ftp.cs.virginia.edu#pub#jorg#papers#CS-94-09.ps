Abstract: Distribution of continuous media traffic such as digital audio and video over packet-switching networks has become increasingly feasible due to a number of technology trends leading to powerful desktop computers and high-speed integrated services networks. Protocols supporting the transmission of continuous media are already available. In these protocols, transmission errors due to packet loss are generally not recovered. Instead existing protocol designs focus on preventive error control techniques that reduce the impact of losses by adding redundancy, e.g., forward error correction, or by preventing loss of important data, e.g., channel coding. The goal of this study is to show that retransmission of continuous media data often is, contrary to conventional wisdom, a viable option in most packet-switching networks. If timely retransmission can be performed with a high probability of success, a retransmission-based approach to error control is attractive because it imposes little overhead on network resources and can be used in conjunction with preventive error control schemes. Since interactive voice has the most stringent delay and error requirements, the study focuses on retransmission in packet voice protocols. An end-to-end model of packet voice transmission is presented and used to investigate the feasibility of retransmission for a wide range of network scenarios. The analytical findings are compared with measurements of packet voice transmission over a campus backbone network.

Reference-contexts: Conventional error control techniques are unacceptable since they do not consider the delay sensitivity of voice data. Hence, researchers have dismissed a retransmission-based approach to error control, focusing instead on open-loop techniques that recover or limit the effects of losses. Forward error correction (FEC) <ref> [3, 17] </ref> provides robustness in the presence of packet loss by adding redundant information to the original samples. If only a small number of packets is lost, the added redundancy enables a reconstruction of the original voice data at the receiver.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Continuous media services such as voice and video were traditionally carried over circuit-switching networks. Using packet-switching networks for these services has become increasingly attractive due to technology trends that have enabled high-speed multiservice networks. Since voice and video are inherently variable rate sources <ref> [4, 12] </ref>, statistical multiplexing gains in packet-switching networks result in a more efficient use of network resources than circuit switching. <p> An important consideration in the design of packet voice protocols is that speech is actually an alternating series of activity periods, or talkspurts, followed by silence periods with the activity periods constituting only around 40% of the total time <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.1 Encoding and Packetization The packet voice source continuously collects and buffers digitized voice samples. After a fixed period of time, the so-called packetization interval, voice samples collected by the audio hardware are placed into a network packet, and the packet is submitted to the network.

Reference-contexts: Recall that we measure roundtrip delays of packets in the network rather than their unidirectional latencies. A common methodology in measurement studies is to estimate the one-way network delay by dividing in half the measured roundtrip delay. However, as in the wide-area study presented in <ref> [8] </ref>, our measurements suggest that a roundtrip delay measurement is unlikely to be the sum of two unidirectional delays of approximately the same magnitude. Thus we use the measured roundtrip delays as estimates of the unidirectional network delay from the source machine to the remote machine.

Since current packet-switching networks do not provide a bounded delay service, voice protocols must provide mechanisms that can cope with highly variable end-to-end delays.

Reference-contexts: When the remote machine receives a datagram, it immediately reflects the datagram back to the traffic-generating workstation. Packet delays were measured by a software-based network monitoring tool <ref> [14] </ref> running on an Intel 486 workstation, which was attached to the same local-area network as the traffic-generating workstation. This network monitor node captured each packet on the local network segment and timestamped the packet with a clock accuracy of 1 ms.
