Abstract: Virtual environment research has focused on interactive image generation and has largely ignored acoustic modeling for spatialization of sound. Yet, realistic auditory cues can complement and enhance visual cues to aid navigation, comprehension, and sense of presence in virtual environments. A primary challenge in acoustic modeling is computation of reverberation paths from sound sources fast enough for real-time auralization. We have developed a system that uses precomputed spatial subdivision and beam tree data structures to enable real-time acoustic modeling and auralization in interactive virtual environments. The spatial subdivision is a partition of 3D space into convex polyhedral regions (cells) represented as a cell adjacency graph. A beam tracing algorithm recursively traces pyramidal beams through the spatial subdivision to construct a beam tree data structure representing the regions of space reachable by each potential sequence of transmission and specular reflection events at cell boundaries. From these precomputed data structures, we can generate high-order specular reflection and transmission paths at interactive rates to spatialize fixed sound sources in real-time as the user moves through a virtual environment. Unlike previous acoustic modeling work, our beam tracing method: 1) supports evaluation of reverberation paths at interactive rates, 2) scales to compute high-order reflections and large environments, and 3) extends naturally to compute paths of diffraction and diffuse reflection efficiently. We are using this system to develop interactive applications in which a user experiences a virtual environment immersively via simultaneous auralization and visualization.

Reference-contexts: Currently available auralization systems generally model only early specular reflections, while late reverberations and diffractions are modeled with statistical approximations <ref> [1, 25, 40, 53] </ref>. Also, due to the computational complexity of current systems, they generally consider only simple geometric arrangements and low-order specular reflections. For instance, the Acoustetron [17] computes only first- and second-order specular reflections for box-shaped virtual environments.

Reference-contexts: Prior methods can be classified into four types: 1) image source methods, 2) radiant exchange methods 3) path tracing, and 4) beam tracing. 2.1 Image Source Methods Image source methods <ref> [2, 6] </ref> compute specular reflection paths by considering virtual sources generated by mirroring the location of the audio source, S, over each polygonal surface of the environment (see Figure 2). <p> Beam tracing allows the recursion tree of virtual sources to be pruned significantly. On the other hand, the image source method is more efficient for a box-shaped environment for which a regular lattice of virtual sources can be constructed that are guaranteed to be visible for all receiver locations <ref> [2] </ref>. As compared to path tracing methods, the primary advantage of beam tracing is that it takes advantage of spatial coherence, as each beam-surface intersection represents an infinite number of ray-surface intersections.

Reference-contexts: Also, pyramidal beam tracing does not suffer from sampling artifacts of ray tracing [35] or the overlap problems of cone tracing <ref> [3, 55] </ref>, since the entire 2D space of directions leaving the source can be covered by beams exactly.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the beam tracing algorithm is well-suited for parallelization, with much of the previous work in parallel ray tracing directly applicable <ref> [4] </ref>. Also, the geometric regions covered by each node of the beam tree could be stored in a single hierarchical spatial structure (e.g., a BSP), allowing logarithmic search during path generation, rather than linear search of the beams inside a single cell.

Reference-contexts: We can trace the beam through the cell adjacency graph to find the region of space reached from any point on the reflecting part of the surface (i.e., the anti-penumbra [50]). We have implemented these methods so far in 2D using a planar winged-edge representation <ref> [5] </ref> for the spatial subdivision and a bow-tie representation [49] for the beams. Unfortunately, tracing 3D beams of diffraction and diffuse reflection is more complicated.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage is generality. As each ray-surface intersection is found, paths of specular reflection, diffuse reflection, diffraction, and refraction can be sampled <ref> [10] </ref>, thereby modeling arbitrary types of indirect reverberation, even for models with curved surfaces. The primary disadvantages of path tracing methods stem from the fact that the continuous 5D space of rays is sampled by a discrete set of paths, leading to aliasing and errors in predicted room responses [35].

Reference-contexts: Finally, the (anechoic) input audio signal is auralized by convolving it with the binaural impulse responses to produce a stereo spatialized audio signal. In the future, we intend to incorporate source directivity, frequency-dependent absorption [34], and angle-dependent absorption <ref> [11, 43] </ref> into our acoustic models. A separate, concurrently executing process is spawned to perform convolution of the computed binaural impulse responses with the input audio signal.

Reference-contexts: First, qualitative changes in sound reverberation, such as more absorption in a room with more lush carpets, can enhance and reinforce visual comprehension of the environment. Second, spatialized sound can be useful for providing audio cues to aid navigation, communication, and sense of presence <ref> [14] </ref>. For example, the sounds of objects requiring user attention can be spa-tialized according to their positions in order to aid object location and binaural selectivity of desired signals (e.g., cocktail party effect).

Reference-contexts: Although acoustic modeling has been well-studied in the context of non-interactive applications [34], such as concert hall design, there has been relatively little prior research in real-time acoustic modeling for virtual environment systems <ref> [15] </ref>. Currently available auralization systems generally model only early specular reflections, while late reverberations and diffractions are modeled with statistical approximations [1, 25, 40, 53].

Reference-contexts: Another disadvantage of path tracing is that the results are dependent on a particular receiver position, and thus these methods are not directly applicable in virtual environment applications where either the source or receiver is moving continuously. 2.4 Beam Tracing Methods Beam tracing methods <ref> [23] </ref> classify reflection paths from a source by recursively tracing pyramidal beams (i.e., sets of rays) through the environment. Briefly, a set of pyramidal beams are constructed that completely cover the 2D space of directions from the source. <p> Another limitation is that reflections off curved surfaces and refractions are difficult to model. Geometric beam tracing has been used in a variety of applications, including acoustic modeling [13, 38, 46, 57], illumination <ref> [9, 19, 20, 22, 23, 59] </ref>, and radio propagation [16]. The challenge is to perform geometric operations (i.e., intersection, clipping, and mirroring) on beams efficiently as they are traced recursively through a complex environment. <p> In this case, the beam representation is only useful for modeling the distribution of rays/energy with distance and for avoiding large tolerances in ray-receiver intersection calculations. If beams are not clipped or split when they intersect more than one surface, significant reverberation paths can be missed. Heckbert and Hanrahan <ref> [23] </ref> described an algorithm for illumination in which pyramidal beams represented by their 2D polygonal cross-sections are traced recursively either forward from a viewpoint or backward from a point light source. For each beam, all polygons are processed in front to back order. <p> During a preprocessing phase, a binary space partition (BSP) tree structure is constructed and augmented with storage for the convex hull for each subtree. Then, during beam tracing, the HSR is used to accelerate queries to find an ordered set of polygons potentially intersecting each beam. As in <ref> [23] </ref>, beams are represented by their 2D polygonal cross-sections and are updated using the Weiler-Atherton clipping algorithm [60] at polygon intersections. <p> In this paper, we describe beam tracing data structures and algorithms for real-time acoustic modeling in interactive virtual environment applications. Our method is most closely related to work in <ref> [23] </ref> and [51]. <p> Execution continues recursively for each beam until the length of every path exceeds a user-specified threshold or when the absorption along every path becomes too large. While tracing beams through the spatial subdivision, our algorithm constructs a beam tree data structure <ref> [23] </ref> to be used for rapid determination of reverberation paths from the source point later during the path generation phase. The beam tree corresponds directly to the recursion tree generated during the depth-first traversal through the cell adjacency graph. <p> Bi-directional beam tracing (computing kth-order reflections by combining beams traced up to k=2 reflections from both the source and the receiver positions <ref> [23, 24] </ref>) should also improve performance. We plan to experiment with these techniques and to incorporate moving sound sources into our system in the near future. 6.3 Simulation Verification Verification of our simulation results by comparison to measured data is an important topic for further discussion.

Reference-contexts: We have already included these extensions in a 2D beam tracing implementation, and we are currently working on a similar 3D implementation. First, consider diffraction. According to the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction <ref> [29] </ref>, an acoustic field that is incident on a discontinuity along an edge has a diffracted wave that propagates into the shadow region. The diffracted wave can be modeled in geometric terms by considering the edge to be a source of new waves emanating from the edge.

As sound may travel from source to receiver via a multitude of reflection, transmission, and diffraction paths, accurate simulation is extremely compute intensive.

Reference-contexts: Although acoustic modeling has been well-studied in the context of non-interactive applications <ref> [34] </ref>, such as concert hall design, there has been relatively little prior research in real-time acoustic modeling for virtual environment systems [15]. Currently available auralization systems generally model only early specular reflections, while late reverberations and diffractions are modeled with statistical approximations [1, 25, 40, 53]. <p> Finally, the (anechoic) input audio signal is auralized by convolving it with the binaural impulse responses to produce a stereo spatialized audio signal. In the future, we intend to incorporate source directivity, frequency-dependent absorption <ref> [34] </ref>, and angle-dependent absorption [11, 43] into our acoustic models. A separate, concurrently executing process is spawned to perform convolution of the computed binaural impulse responses with the input audio signal. <p> Of course, paths of diffraction and diffuse reflection are also important for accurate acoustic modeling <ref> [34, 26] </ref>. Fortunately, our beam tracing algorithm and beam tree representation can be generalized to model these effects.

Reference-contexts: The primary disadvantages of path tracing methods stem from the fact that the continuous 5D space of rays is sampled by a discrete set of paths, leading to aliasing and errors in predicted room responses <ref> [35] </ref>. For instance, in ray tracing, the receiver position and diffracting edges are often approximated by volumes of space (in order to admit intersections with infinitely thin rays), which can lead to false hits and paths counted multiple times [35]. Moreover, important reverberation paths may be missed by all samples. <p> of paths, leading to aliasing and errors in predicted room responses <ref> [35] </ref>.

Also, pyramidal beam tracing does not suffer from sampling artifacts of ray tracing <ref> [35] </ref> or the overlap problems of cone tracing [3, 55], since the entire 2D space of directions leaving the source can be covered by beams exactly.

Reference-contexts: We build the spatial subdivision using a Binary Space Partition (BSP) [18], a recursive binary split of 3D space into convex polyhedral regions (cells) separated by planes. To construct the BSP, we recursively split cells by candidate planes selected by the method described in <ref> [41] </ref>. The binary splitting process continues until no input polygon intersects the interior of any BSP cell. The result of the BSP is a set of convex polyhedral cells whose convex, planar boundaries contain all the input polygons. <p> The storage requirements of the spatial subdivision data structure also grow linearly as they are dominated by the vertices of link polygons. The time required to construct the spatial subdivisions grows super-linearly, dominated by the code that selects and orders splitting planes during BSP construction (see <ref> [41] </ref>).
