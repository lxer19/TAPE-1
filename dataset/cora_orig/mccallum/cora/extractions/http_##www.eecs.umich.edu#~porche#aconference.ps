Abstract: ALLONS-D is a decentralized real-time traffic control scheme. Through simulations, the scheme is shown to be suitable for adaptive control of an isolated intersection. An efficient tree searching algorithm, constrained only by a maximum and minimum green time per phase is used to find a traffic signal plan that minimizes delay. Differences between ALLONS-D & other real-time traffic control schemes, such as OPAC, are described. The scheme can also be used to reduce travel times on transit routes. For arterial networks of intersections, ALLONS-D is capable of inducing a level of coordination that results in progressive signal plans. An extension of the scheme to provide network-wide optimization of traffic signals is explained in the form of a two-layer scheme. Simulation experiments are performed with a newly developed simulator called STNS.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION In this paper, we provide a further description of ALLONS-D <ref> [1] </ref>, a real-time traffic responsive strategy. ALLONS-D (Adaptive Limited Lookahead Optimization of Network Signals Decentralized) is a decentralized method based on the Rolling Horizon (RH) concept in dynamic optimization. We consider how ALLONS-D can be utilized for transit priority applications and network-wide coordination.

Reference-contexts: We consider how ALLONS-D can be utilized for transit priority applications and network-wide coordination. The objective of the ALLONS-D optimizer is to minimize the total delay experienced by traffic at each intersection in a given network. The primary feature distinguishing ALLONS-D from schemes such as SCOOT <ref> [2] </ref> and SCATS [3] is that it is not con strained to generate cyclic plans. Any arbitrary phase sequencing and phase splits are permitted subject only to constraints of a minimum green time and a maximum green time for any phase, in the interests of safety and fairness, respectively.

Reference-contexts: We define cost to be the cumulative delay of all vehicles. In OPAC, the number of cars in a queue multiplied by the interval of time in which the cars were queued is considered the cost to be optimized <ref> [4] </ref>. In ALLONS-D, a more detailed accounting of delay is used which includes weight multipliers for each type of vehicle.
