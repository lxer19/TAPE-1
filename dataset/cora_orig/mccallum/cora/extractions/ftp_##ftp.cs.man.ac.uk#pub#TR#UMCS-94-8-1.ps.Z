Reference-contexts: To quote Allen: In general, we will not use this constraint 4 , but use domain-specific axioms for predicates that are mutually exclusive. For instance, in the blocks world, every block is always either clear, being held, or has another block on top of it <ref> (Allen, 1991b) </ref>. 3 If an interpretation M is the tuple hW; R; D; F ; P i, then M 0 = hW; C (R); D; F ; P i is a comple tion of M, where C (R) is a total order relation over the time points in W such that

Reference-contexts: We also show that these restrictions can prevent actions from being improperly defined. Nonlinear planning is believed to be exponentially more efficient than linear planning <ref> (Chapman, 1987) </ref>. Nonlinear planning avoids most of the unnecessary backtrackings experienced by linear planning. However, some other computational problems arise in nonlinear planning. One of the problems is that it is more difficult to verify nonlinear plans than to verify linear plans.

Reference-contexts: The and D described above will be referred to several times when we discuss other restrictions in this section. Example 4 The action paint-ceiling (ceiling) given in <ref> (Yang, 1989) </ref> can be expressed as in Fig. 3. The property Have (paint) may or may not be deleted by the action. Even if it is a deleted property of the action, it is still not considered to be mutually exclusive with the asserted property P ainted (ceiling).

Reference-contexts: In <ref> (Zhang, 1994) </ref>, we presented a point-based, reified temporal interval logic for nonlinear planning. <p> These restrictions formally specify the mutually dependent relation between reasonable domain constraints and actions. We show that the set of restrictions can prevent actions from being improperly defined. In <ref> (Zhang, 1994) </ref>, we give a set of restrictions on domain constraints based on actions. <p> In this report, we only concern ourselves with point actions. The corresponding results for interval actions are given in <ref> (Zhang, 1994) </ref>. 6 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Behnam Bani-Eqbal, Clare Dixon, Ian Pratt and Rajeev Gore who read an early version of this paper and gave valuable comments.
