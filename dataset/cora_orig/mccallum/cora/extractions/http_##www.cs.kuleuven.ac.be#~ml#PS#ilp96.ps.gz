Abstract: In this paper, we indicate some possible applications of ILP or similar techniques in the knowledge discovery field, and then discuss several methods for adapting and linking ILP-systems to relational database systems. The proposed methods range from "pure ILP" to "based on techniques originating in ILP". We show that it is both easy and advantageous to adapt ILP-systems in this way.

Reference-contexts: Every clause describes the data in some way, and the set of all valid clauses forms a maximally informative description of the data. ILP systems using this setting exist (e.g. Claudien <ref> [1] </ref>, icl [2]) but are far less numerous than systems using the classical setting. There is a straightforward relationship between finding an intensional definition for a relation, and classification of tuples. <p> Claudien <ref> [1] </ref>, icl [2]), or, when they are implemented in another 1 It should be mentioned here that most ILP systems work with positive and negative examples, while in a database only positive examples are given. The closed world assumption has to be made in this case. <p> The closed world assumption has to be made in this case. Recently, however, more attention has been given to ILP systems that learn from positive examples only (this is often called learning in a non-monotonic setting; see for instance <ref> [1] </ref>). These systems are the ones for which the analogy holds best. language, use libraries that implement many features of a Prolog system (e.g. [9]). Some Prolog systems can be linked to relational databases.

Reference-contexts: More elaborate language specifications could be based on those used in ILP systems (e.g. D lab <ref> [3] </ref>), but there will probably be enough differences to justify some specific research on, for instance, language specifications for SQL. The search space is expected to be organized differently than the clausal logic search spaces.

Reference-contexts: As a database typically contains more than one relation, it seems clear that a lot of interesting rules are simply not considered when using propositional techniques. Nevertheless, research in the data mining community has focused mainly on these techniques (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>). Finding inter-relation rules can sometimes be simulated by computing the universal relation (i.e. joining all the relations into one relation), but this may be a very costly operation, and the universal relation can be very large. For this reason, it seems that ILP offers interesting opportunities to data mining.

Reference-contexts: A theoretical answer to whether R can at all be expressed in terms of a set of relations R using the relational algebra, was given years ago, see for instance <ref> [10] </ref>. However, there does not seem to be an easy way of computing the answer to this question (i.e. one that is significantly faster than just trying to find such an expression and eventually failing if none exists). <p> These results can be found in most standard works on database theory, e.g. [4]. Several operators are defined in the relational algebra, but it can be proven that they can all be defined using the following five operators (see also <ref> [10] </ref>): the cartesian product of two relations (R fi S) the union of two relations having the same arity (R [ S) the projection of a relation on certain attributes ( i 1 ;:::;i n (R)) the selection from a relation of those tuples for which the value of two at
