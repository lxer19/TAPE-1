Abstract: The paper presents a model of cooperation in dialogues which emphasizes the role of ethical consideration in the formation and persistence of the agents' intentions. It is argued that the agents' knowledge of the task is not enough for successful communication, but the agents must also consider each other ethically. Their cooperation involves not only benevolent goal adoption but also evaluation of the partner's goal in the communicative context, given the agent's own preferences and the general principles of

Reference-contexts: They need not fully cooperate all the time, and their cooperation may vary within the same interaction, but if there exists a conflict between the agents which becomes so serious that cooperation becomes impossible, there will be no communication either. According to <ref> [ Allwood, 1976 ] </ref> , agents are engaged in Ideal Cooperation (IC), if they: 1. voluntarily strive to achieve the same purposes, 2. show cognitive consideration towards each other, 3. show ethical consideration towards each other, 4. trust each other to act according to (1) - (3) unless explicit notice is <p> Ethical consideration obliges the agent not to harm or cause pain to the partner, and so it also accounts for the agents' politeness, indirectness, feedback, extra help, explanations, etc. According to <ref> [ Allwood, 1976 ] </ref> , IC, based on the human ability for rational coordinated interaction, creates social normative obligations which concern the speaker's sincerity, motivation, and consideration. Finally, as long as the agents trust each other to act according to these principles, communication appears cooperative.

Reference-contexts: However, the basic setting of social interaction requires that the agents' selfish view-points fit together: if the agents are to interact a lot, it is better to cooperate since this pays back best in the long run <ref> [ Axelrod, 1984 ] </ref> . To achieve their goals, the agents thus construct a mutual context in which other agents can recognize their goals and then, hopefully, provide help or collaborate with them.

Reference-contexts: The agents can thus attempt to achieve loose and general joint purposes ("let's keep in contact"), in which case their actions are mainly constrained by general social requirements rather than a SharedPlan; yet 1 Cf. <ref> [ Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1990 ] </ref> who talk about communication as a collaborative process, and [ Lochbaum, 1994 ] who refers to knowledge preconditions and their fulfilment. the construction of mutual context in which to keep contact is based on the principles of IC.

Reference-contexts: A persistent goal (PGOAL x p q) is defined as a goal such that the agent x attempts to bring about p until she believes that p is true, it is impossible to achieve, or the reason q for p has become irrelevant <ref> [ Cohen and Levesque, 1990 ] </ref> . We also need means to reason about plan recipes 2 for collaborative task fulfilment. For this, we have adopted explicit predicates from the SharedPlan formalism by [ Grosz and Kraus, 1995 ] , and adjusted them to our notation.

Galliers. </author> <title> A theoretical framework for computer models of cooperative dialogue, acknowledging multi-agent conflict. </title> <type> Technical Report 172, </type> <institution> University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory, </institution> <year> 1989. </year>
Reference-contexts: However, cooperation is not just a pre-assigned agent disposition to act in a helpful way, but involves reasoning through which the agent determines how to react in the current context, given the agent's own preferences and the general principles of Ideal Cooperation. As <ref> [ Galliers, 1989 ] </ref> points out, cooperation also includes the ability to negotiate and resolve conflicting goals, and so if the agents are always ready to adopt the partner's goals they are benevolent rather than cooperative. <p> Consequently, we can represent Grosz and Kraus' meta-predicte WBCBA ('weakly believe can bring about') with the help of BEL and WCBA: (BEL x (WCBA x p R c). The agent's ability to evaluate alternative recipes is captured in the predicate PREFER. Following <ref> [ Galliers, 1989 ] </ref> , we define preference as the agent having the goal that eventually p and not the goal that eventually q, given that she believes either p or q can be true in the future. <p> When the agent recognises the partner's goal that eventually p, and if she prefers this goal to be true rather than not true in the future, she will adopt a persistent goal that p relative to the constraints c. JOINTP resembles COOP-I in <ref> [ Galliers, 1989 ] </ref> (recognition of the 3 In the latter case the event would be better represented as (SAID x p) or (SAID y p), where SAID is an action predicate for uttering an utterance, and p is the proposition communicated by the partner's utterance. <p> goal that eventually p, then at least one of the agents is committed to the goal that eventually p, relative to R: (INIT x y p R) = def (BEL x (GOAL y p)) ) ((PGOAL x p R)) or (PGOAL y p R))) This is similar to COOP-M in <ref> [ Galliers, 1989 ] </ref> which concerns two agents cooperating on a goal that both independently possess.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out by <ref> [ Grosz and Kraus, 1995 ] </ref> , the agents cannot opt out from their joint commitment without telling so to the partner. This paper argues that the agent's commitment to a joint goal is based on her trying to act according to the principles of Ideal Cooperation. <p> We also need means to reason about plan recipes 2 for collaborative task fulfilment. For this, we have adopted explicit predicates from the SharedPlan formalism by <ref> [ Grosz and Kraus, 1995 ] </ref> , and adjusted them to our notation.

Reference-contexts: Since the agent is a competent actor, she must also believe that she can weakly bring about the extended recipe, either by performing the necessary constituent actions herself or contracting them out. We call S an Operationally Appropriate Plan <ref> [ Jokinen, 1995 ] </ref> . 4.3 Ethical consideration ETHICAL represents the agent's consideration of the partner's rationality and well-being if the partner accepts an Operationally Appropriate Plan as a new SharedPlan.

Reference-contexts: act according to the principles, but if the agent believes that the partner behaves in a cooperative way, there is no way to find out the deception: cooperation is not an absolute concept but subject to individual solipsism. 3 Ideal Cooperation and Collaboration Cooperation is distinguished from collaboration or teamwork <ref> [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] </ref> , where the agents work together on a joint task and are jointly committed to a common goal. <p> Hence, although cooperation is important in collaboration, the agents need not collaborate to exhibit cooperation. <ref> [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] </ref> define the joint persistent goal in teamwork analogously to the individual persistent goal, except that the agents have a weak mutual goal to achieve p: if they privately discover that p is done, impossible to achieve or irrelevant, they have to make this mutually known.

Reference-contexts: The agents can thus attempt to achieve loose and general joint purposes ("let's keep in contact"), in which case their actions are mainly constrained by general social requirements rather than a SharedPlan; yet 1 Cf.
