Abstract: Highly parallelizable domain decomposition Dirichlet-Dirichlet solvers for hp-version finite element methods on angular quasiuniform triangular meshes are studied under different assumptions on a reference element. The edge coordinate functions of a reference element are allowed to be either nodal, with special choices of nodes, or hierarchical polynomials of several types . In relation to the definition of these coordinate functions within the elements, we also distinguish two cases: arbitrary and so-called discrete quasi-harmonic coordinate functions. The latter are obtained by means of explicitely given and nonexpensive prolongation operators. In all these situations, we are able to suggest preconditioners which are spectrally equivalent to the global stiffness matrix, which require only the element-by-element and edge-by-edge operations and reduce the computational cost. In this way, elimination is avoided when dealing with an interface problem. In our domain decomposition algorithms, we essentially use prolongation operators from the interface boundary inside the subdomains of the decomposition according to the approach initially used for the hp-version with quadrilateral elements in [19]-[22].

Reference-contexts: It is easy to establish that the condition number of the matrix D (II) is O (p=h). Therefore, in order to guarantee that * 0:5 and, consequently, (4.17) holds, it is necessary to perform n (*) = O ( p iterations; see <ref> [4] </ref> and [39]. At each iteration, the multiplication by D (II) may be done in parallel for each element. This follows from (4.15) that D (II) v = r where the matrices D r and vectors v r are considered to be continued by zero entries.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The hp-version well matches the basic requirements for efficient computations in many practical cases. Adding new possibilities for adaptivity, it provides the fastest, i.e., exponential rate of convergence, see <ref> [6] </ref>, [43], [16],[17], and at the same time allows to use highly parallelizable DD (domain decomposition) solvers. Evidently, a key to the problem of implementation of the hp-version best features is in the solver. <p> Such prolongations or, as they also called, liftings in polynomial spaces were studied for a number of reasons by several authors <ref> [6] </ref>,[32],[9],[5],[7],[8], [34] and initially by Babuska and Suri [6] in the derivation of the approximation estimates related to the hp-version.

Reference-contexts: By this reason development DD solvers for the hp-version has been paid recently a good deal of attention. Basic ideas came from studies of the DD algorithms in general and for the h-version, among which are works of Bramble, Pasciak and Schatz <ref> [11] </ref>, Matsokin and Nepomnyaschikh [33],[35], Dryja and Widlund [18],[42] and Lions [31]. First attempt to analyze DD Dirichlet-Dirichlet algorithms for the p-version was made by Babuska, Craig, Mandel and Pitkaranta [5], who developed also important technical tools for future studies. <p> Under assumption of orthogonality of the internal for elements and edge coordinate functions, they proved the estimate for the relative condition number O (1 + log 2 p) similar to the estimate O ((H=h) 2 ) in <ref> [11] </ref> for the h-version. Further developments of DD Dirichlet-Dirichlet algorithms, which are our concern in this paper, were aimed at obtaining preconditioners spectrally equivalent or almost spectrally equivalent to the stiffness matrix 1 and having lower computational cost.

These sets of nodes are 7 the same as those used on the edges of the square reference elements in <ref> [19] </ref> .

Inequalities (6.19) follow from (6.20) by interpolation between the spaces L 2 (@o 0 ) and H 1 (@o 0 ). The equivalence (6.15) for norms are a consequence of (6.17) and (6.19). The proof of inequalities (6.15) for norms is in essentially the same.

As in the case of Theorem 4.1, the inequalities (4.33) retain if edge Galerkin coordinate functions are orthogonal to the Galerkin coordinate functions internal for each element. <p> The proof is exactly the same as the proof of Lemma 2.2 in <ref> [30] </ref> for the case of the square reference elements, except that instead of norms and the trace theorems for the reference square norms and the trace theorems for the triangle o 0 are used. 6.2 Proof of Theorem 4.1 Proof. <p> The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 6.1 in <ref> [30] </ref>. <p> 0 ) and v cos (y) = v (Y (y)), then kvk 1=2;@o 0 i kv cos k 1=2;@o 0 : (6.17) In order to prove this, first we note that the equivalence kvk 1=2;T (k) i kv cos k 1=2;T (k) : is a consequence of Lemma 6.1 in <ref> [30] </ref>. Thus, it remains to consider only the terms in k k 1=2;@o 0 that are additional to the sum of k k 1=2;T (k) , k = 1; 2; 3. These terms correspond to the vertices of the reference triangle and it is sufficient to consider one vertex, e.g.

Reference-contexts: Basic ideas came from studies of the DD algorithms in general and for the h-version, among which are works of Bramble, Pasciak and Schatz [11], Matsokin and Nepomnyaschikh [33],[35], Dryja and Widlund [18],[42] and Lions <ref> [31] </ref>. First attempt to analyze DD Dirichlet-Dirichlet algorithms for the p-version was made by Babuska, Craig, Mandel and Pitkaranta [5], who developed also important technical tools for future studies.

Reference-contexts: Incorporating special explicitly-given and computationally-cheap prolongation operators into DD preconditioners stems from DD techniques for h-version finite element methods (see Matsokin and Nepomnyaschikh <ref> [33] </ref> and Nepom-nyaschikh [35] and the bibliographies therein).

Reference-contexts: Prolongations in polynomial spaces were initially used in DD preconditioners for hp-version finite element methods by Korneev and Ivanov [19]- [22] and after in [29],[30], [10] . Such prolongations or, as they also called, liftings in polynomial spaces were studied for a number of reasons by several authors [6],[32],[9],[5],[7],[8], <ref> [34] </ref> and initially by Babuska and Suri [6] in the derivation of the approximation estimates related to the hp-version. For computational use, we need efficient and cheap prolongation operators, which were suggested recently in [8] and we follow the approach developed there. <p> we extend the edge coordinate functions p ff into the interior of the triangle through the prolongation (3.8). 9 3.3 Prolongation Operators Construction of prolongation operators in polynomial spaces for which (3.6) holds were studied by Babuska and Suri [6], Babuska et al.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to establish that the condition number of the matrix D (II) is O (p=h). Therefore, in order to guarantee that * 0:5 and, consequently, (4.17) holds, it is necessary to perform n (*) = O ( p iterations; see [4] and <ref> [39] </ref>. At each iteration, the multiplication by D (II) may be done in parallel for each element. This follows from (4.15) that D (II) v = r where the matrices D r and vectors v r are considered to be continued by zero entries. <p> In practical implementations, the necessary number of iterations n (*) may be determined from a-priori estimates, which are easy to derive. Another way to approximate n (*) is to use an approximate value of the construction number following the technique described, e.g., in Samarskii and Nikolayev <ref> [39] </ref>. From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the preconditioner for the interface problem defined in (4.16) is rather cheap, when the bilinear form satisfies (2.2) and (2.3). However, convergence deteriorates, as the ratio 2 = 1 grows.

Reference-contexts: The procedure of defining edge and vertex coordinate functions by means of prolongation operators may be easily incorporated into existing software. It is for reason that Shephard et al. <ref> [40] </ref> used for description of the edge functions the procedure based also on continuation of the traces, but by means of blending functions. 3 There are several modifications of the present approach that lead to different algorithms with similar mathematical justifications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The hp-version well matches the basic requirements for efficient computations in many practical cases. Adding new possibilities for adaptivity, it provides the fastest, i.e., exponential rate of convergence, see [6], <ref> [43] </ref>, [16],[17], and at the same time allows to use highly parallelizable DD (domain decomposition) solvers. Evidently, a key to the problem of implementation of the hp-version best features is in the solver.
