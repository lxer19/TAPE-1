Abstract: The Multicast Backbone (MBone) is a network overlaying the global Internet designed to support multipoint applications. In this paper, we first give an overview of the development and architecture of the current MBone. One important characteristic of the MBone is its reliance on IP multicast which allows receivers to join and leave groups asynchronously. We describe The Mlisten data collection tool that was created to provide a mechanism for capturing information about when members join and leave a multicast group. Using data collected with Mlisten, we present statistics about some of the MBone sessions we monitored. Results are provided for key parameters including multicast participant inter-arrival times and participant durations, multicast tree size and characteristics, and inter-session relationships. By collecting data about MBone usage we can improve our understanding of how multicast communication and real-time protocols are being used today.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Multicast Backbone (MBone) is a network integrated into the global Internet <ref> [1] </ref>. It provides one-to-many, best effort delivery of real-time multimedia data between MBone-connected hosts. The MBone has served as a testbed for the development of multicast protocols, real-time protocols, and group conferencing tools.

Reference-contexts: We are not aware of any similar work aimed at collecting MBone multicast group membership or using this data to generate statistics or models. Nevertheless, our work is related to a body of work aimed at understanding the operation of the MBone. Such efforts include debugging tools <ref> [2, 3] </ref> that have been developed to analyze network problems. These tools try to isolate problems by determining routes and the status of links in the MBone.

MBone Tree with Observed Source: We use the MBone topology and create a source to destination set tree.

Reference-contexts: Two reasons are: (1) unreliable packet delivery, and (2) anomalous MBone behavior. These are briefly described below. For a complete description of why these inaccuracies occur and how they are corrected, see <ref> [8] </ref>. Unreliability. Unreliability causes packet loss and delivery jitter which can result in some group members appearing to leave a session, but not actually doing so. <p> Using a combination of inspection and automated processing we can process the log file to eliminate abnormal behavior. A complete description with examples can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. 4 4 Analysis Methodology MBone data has been collected since the beginning of 1995. Over the course of these nearly two years we have improved the range of data collected. The first data sets consisted of only the membership information for a single audio session. <p> Our statistical results and analysis are based on as much data as was collected at the time. Additional results continue to become available as ongoing data sets become available. In this paper we only present a very small subset of available results. Other results are reported in <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. Results of our analysis are divided into four categories: (1) temporal, (2) spatial, (3) inter-session, and (4) intra-session. A description of each is given below. * Temporal results consist of group join inter-arrival time and membership duration.

Reference-contexts: For membership duration data, we use a Zipf distribution which works when a large percentage of (duration) samples are concentrated at the beginning of the range while the remaining percentage are widely dispersed over the remainder of the spectrum <ref> [10] </ref>. This is exactly the type of behavior exhibited. We have used the fitting technique described above to model a significant number of MBone sessions. In general, an exponential function works well for the inter-arrival data regardless of the type of session (short vs long vs an aggregate of sessions).

Reference-contexts: Multicast Tree Hop Count. In computing the cost of reaching a set of destinations, we consider several types of trees. Our cost metric is that of packet-hops (first used in <ref> [11] </ref>). For example, a tree from a source to multiple destinations will have a cost in packet-hops equal to the number of links in the tree. The types of trees we consider are: 1. <p> The routes used are roughly approximated using the MWatch tool [3]. 8 The multicast hop count is compared to a unicast hop count which is computed assuming that the source transmits to each receiver individually (also known as the separately-addressed packets scheme <ref> [11] </ref>). 2. MBone Tree with Georgia Tech Source: In order to assess the sensitivity of tree costs to source location we repeat the above analysis but assume a host at Georgia Tech is the source.
