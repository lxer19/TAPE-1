Abstract: Conditional logics, introduced by Lewis and Stalnaker, have been utilized in artificial intelligence to capture a broad range of phenomena. In this paper we examine the complexity of several variants discussed in the literature. We show that, in general, deciding satisfiability is PSPACE-complete for formulas with arbitrary conditional nesting and NP-complete for formulas with bounded nesting of conditionals. However, we provide several exceptions to this rule. Of particular note are results showing that (a) when assuming uniformity (i.e., that all worlds agree on what worlds are possible), the decision problem becomes EXPTIME-complete even for formulas with bounded nesting, and (b) when assuming absoluteness (i.e., that all worlds agree on all conditional statements), the decision problem is NP-complete for for mulas with arbitrary nesting.

Lewis's construction starts with a set W of possible worlds, each one describing a possible way the world might be. We associate with each possible world w 2 W a preorder w over a subset W w of W . <p> As these examples suggest, we can construct a number of different logics, depending on the assumptions we make about w . In this paper, we focus on the following assumptions (all of which have been considered before <ref> [Lew73, Bur81, Gra91, KS91] </ref>), which apply to all w 2 W : 1 N Normality : W w 6= ;.

We use the semantic representation suggested by Lewis to capture conditionals <ref> [Lew73, Bur81] </ref>: A structure M is a tuple (W; ; R), such that W is a set of possible worlds, maps each possible world to a truth assignment over , and R is a ternary relation over W . <p> Unfortunately, if W is infinite, it may not have minimal '-worlds.

Proof: Assume we are given M 2 M and w such that (M; w) j= '.

Reference-contexts: In nonmonotonic reasoning the w relation captures an agent's plausibility ordering on the worlds, so that w 0 w 00 if w 0 is more plausible than w 00 according to the agent's beliefs in w. Typically (although not, for example, in <ref> [FH94a] </ref>) it is assumed that the agent's beliefs are the same in all the worlds in W , so that w is independent of w. <p> As we observed in the introduction, such logics are now being used in many areas of artificial intelligence. The techniques we have introduced in this paper (especially the results in Section 3) can applied to frameworks that combine conditional logics with other modalities. For example, in <ref> [FH94a] </ref> we use these results to derive complexity results for a logic that contains both conditionals and epistemic modalities. 10 The axiom for strict centering is ' , '. We did not attempt, in this work, to isolate tractable fragments of the logic.

In general, conditional logics provide a logical language to reason about structures that contain some sort of ordering. <p> As these examples suggest, we can construct a number of different logics, depending on the assumptions we make about w .

Reference-contexts: We show that an appropriate modal logic (either K,D or T depending on the variant in question) can be embedded in most variants of the logic. 6 The result then follows from results of Ladner <ref> [Lad77, HM92] </ref> on the complexity of satisfiability for these logics. There are exceptions to the PSPACE results. For one thing, it already follows from our "small model" results that for bounded-depth formulas (in particular, depth-one formulas) satisfia-bility is NP-complete. <p> See Section 4 for a review of these complexity-theoretic notions. 6 We assume familiarity with modal logic, especially the logics K, D and T. See <ref> [HM92] </ref> for an overview of these logics and their axiomatizations. 7 p 2 is the complexity class that is characterized by decision problems that can be determined in polynomial time given an NP oracle. <p> If K is reflexive, then w is accessible from w. Thus, w 2 W w in M , and hence minimal (since all worlds in W w are minimal). Finally, if K is both transitive and Euclidean, then then it is well known (see <ref> [HM92] </ref>) that we can assume without loss of generality that the same set of worlds is accessible from each w 2 W . This implies that the ordering at each world is the same. Thus, M satisfies absoluteness. In the presence of uniformity we can get similar results. <p> Thus, M satisfies absoluteness. In the presence of uniformity we can get similar results. However the reduction is less natural. Since such a reduction does not play a role in our treatment of structures satisfying uniformity, we omit the details here.

Reference-contexts: Checking validity is closely related since ' is valid if and only if :' is not satisfiable. We start with an overview of the complexity-theoretic notions we need. For a more detailed treatment of the topic, see <ref> [GJ79, HU79] </ref>. Complexity theory examines the difficulty of determining membership in a set as a function of the input size. In our case we check if a formula ' is in the set of satisfiable formulas. <p> We describe a polynomial space algorithm that essentially searches through all the tree-like structures of the form described in the proof of Proposition 3.7. In order to simplify the description of this algorithm we rely on the fact that NPSPACE (nondeterministic polynomial space) is equivalent to PSPACE <ref> [HU79] </ref>. Thus, we describe an algorithm that uses nondeterministic choices and polynomial space.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The study of conditional statements of the form "If : : : then : : :" has a long history in philosophy [Sta68, Lew73, Che80, Vel85]. In recent years these logics have been applied in artificial intelligence to capture non-monotonic inference <ref> [Del88, Bel89, KLM90, Bou92] </ref>, belief change [Gra91, Bou92], counterfactual reasoning [Gin86], qualitative probabilities [Pea89, GP92], and intentions and desires [Pea93, Bou94]. In general, conditional logics provide a logical language to reason about structures that contain some sort of ordering. <p> Combinations of these conditions are used in the various applications of conditional logics. For example, Boutilier's [Bou92] work in nonmonotonic reasoning assumes absoluteness and considers variants satisfying connectedness; similar assumptions are made in <ref> [KLM90, GP92, Bel89] </ref>. Works on counterfactuals (such as Grahne's [Gra91]) typically assume centering and uniformity. Katsuno and Satoh [KS91] consider variants satisfying absoluteness, centering and connectedness. Completeness results have been obtained for the logics corresponding to various combinations of these constraints [Lew73, Lew74, Bur81].

Reference-contexts: We note that all the logics we examined are intractable because they contain the propositional calculus. It is certainly feasible that there are nontrivial fragments that do not contain the propositional calculus that are tractable (e.g., results in the style of Kautz and Selman's analysis of default logic <ref> [KS89] </ref>). We plan to pursue this issue in the future. We note that the methods used in this paper are certainly relevant to such an investigation.

Reference-contexts: We show that an appropriate modal logic (either K,D or T depending on the variant in question) can be embedded in most variants of the logic. 6 The result then follows from results of Ladner <ref> [Lad77, HM92] </ref> on the complexity of satisfiability for these logics. There are exceptions to the PSPACE results. For one thing, it already follows from our "small model" results that for bounded-depth formulas (in particular, depth-one formulas) satisfia-bility is NP-complete. <p> Moreover, in the presence of absoluteness, every formula is equivalent to one without nesting, so we can again get NP-completeness. Interestingly, the appropriate modal logic in the presence of absoluteness in the lower bound construction mentioned above is S5, whose satisfiability problem is also NP-complete <ref> [Lad77] </ref>. On the other hand, while the assumption of uniformity seems rather innocuous, and much in the spirit of absoluteness, assuming uniformity without absoluteness leads to an EXPTIME-complete satisfiability problem, even for formulas with bounded nesting. <p> Theorem 4.2: If A is a subset of fN; T; R; Cg, the problem of deciding if a formula in L C is satisfiable in M A is PSPACE-complete.

We also provide an overview of a completeness proof fl To appear in Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: Proc. Fourth International Conference (KR '94). which substantially simplifies previous proofs in the literature [Bur81]. <p> For example, in counterfactual reasoning, w is viewed as capturing a measure of distance from w, so that w 0 w w 00 if w 0 is more similar or closer to w than w 00 is. In this variant it is usually assumed <ref> [Lew73] </ref> that the real world is closest to itself. In nonmonotonic reasoning the w relation captures an agent's plausibility ordering on the worlds, so that w 0 w 00 if w 0 is more plausible than w 00 according to the agent's beliefs in w. <p> As these examples suggest, we can construct a number of different logics, depending on the assumptions we make about w .

We use the semantic representation suggested by Lewis to capture conditionals <ref> [Lew73, Bur81] </ref>: A structure M is a tuple (W; ; R), such that W is a set of possible worlds, maps each possible world to a truth assignment over , and R is a ternary relation over W . <p> Unfortunately, if W is infinite, it may not have minimal '-worlds. Thus, the actual definition we use, which is standard in the literature (see <ref> [Lew73, Bur81, Bou92] </ref>), is more complicated. Roughly speaking, '! is true if, from a certain point on, whenever ' is true, so is . <p> It is easy to verify that ' holds at w exactly if all the minimal worlds according to w satisfy ' and that 2' holds at w if all worlds in W w satisfy '.
