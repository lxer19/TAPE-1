Abstract: This paper overviews a novel transfer mode for B-ISDN: Loosely-synchronous Transfer Mode (LTM). LTM operates by signaling periphery nodes when destinations become available. No frame structure is imposed by LTM, thus avoiding adaptation layers. Additionally, LTM can deliver a spectrum of guaranteed quality of services. New Synchronous Protocol Stacks (SPSs) build on LTM by synchronizing their activities to LTM signals. Such signals can be delivered directly to applications that may synchronize its operations to transmissions, thus minimizing buffering due to synchronization mismatches. SPSs can use current transport protocols unchanged and, potentially, enhance them with the real-time capabilities made possible through LTM.

Reference-contexts: The next question to be addressed is how such translation tables are set initially. That is, transport layer entities need to be able to find band identifiers connected to desired destination addresses. A variation of the ARP protocol of the Internet Protocol <ref> [3] </ref> stack is used to implement this function. The protocol works as follows. A special frame containing the address of the requesting TL entity is transmitted during a band to request the TL address of the associated destinations. <p> When errors occur, they are detected at the destination TL entity that requests retransmission using the reverse band to the source. The Internet Protocol . The traditional Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [3] </ref> is a an example of asynchronous communication protocol. To implement IP, a contention band is established to each destination through the ESTABLISH_BAND.request SAP. Packets received from upper layer entities are buffered in the IP layer according to their band identifiers (which is computed from frame destination addresses).

Reference-contexts: The contention band for isochronous services can be used according to distributed protocols that allocate resources by maximizing multiplexing constrained to the tolerable loss allowed by applications, as it is done in the context of ATM networks <ref> [4] </ref>. That is, portions of the contention band for isochronous traffic are allocated not to guarantee lossless communication, but to deliver low probability of loss. In this manner, the portion of the band to be allocated is smaller than would be necessary for no loss.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 compares LTM with STM and ATM. Finally, Section 5 concludes. 2. ISOCHRONETS BACKGROUND The goal of this section is to describe one particular existing LTM network: Iso-chronets [5,10]. It is important to emphasize that other LTM implementations exits, one example being the Highball network <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 2.1. Architecture and Principles of Operations Isochronets seek to provide flexible control of contention to accomplish desired QoS by routing network traffic along routing trees leading to respective destination nodes. Bandwidth is timedivided among, and synchronized along routing trees.

Reference-contexts: The entire network is viewed as a routing medium consisting of rout 4 ing trees. Bandwidth is time and spacedivided among these routes. Sources need access respective trees during their band times, seeing the network as a timedivided medium, much like Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) <ref> [9] </ref>. This technique, accordingly, is called Route Division Multiple Access (RDMA). A contention band is a band that may be shared by multiple sources simultaneously.
