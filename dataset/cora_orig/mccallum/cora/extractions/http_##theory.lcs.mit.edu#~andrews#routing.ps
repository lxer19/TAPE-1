Title: Improved Algorithms for Routing on Two-Dimensional Grids

Reference-contexts: This problem is becoming increasingly important as more and more ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) designs are migrating on standard regular design styles like gate arrays and field programmable gate arrays. Another application of routing on a grid is the wafer-scale restructuring problem <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. Here, the good elements of a faulty wafer must be connected by routing wires along rectilinear channels. The cost is related to both the width of the channels and to the number of bends per wire.

Reference-contexts: We would therefore like to have an algorithm with a performance guarantee in terms of the optimal channel width for each problem. Such algorithms have been given by Karp et al. [4], Burstein and Pelavin <ref> [2] </ref>, Raghavan and Thompson [8, 9] and others. The general framework of most of these algorithms is to formulate the routing problem as an integer program, solve the linear programming relaxation, and then to round the fractional solution.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the problem of finding a one bend routing of nets so that every channel has width at most w was shown to be NP -complete by Karp et al. [4]. N P -completeness results for several related problems appear in a survey by Johnson <ref> [3] </ref>. As a result, most work concentrates on finding worst-case bounds and approximate solutions. One example is the work of Karp et al. [4].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the routing problem on two-dimensional grids is known to be hard to solve. In particular, the problem of finding a one bend routing of nets so that every channel has width at most w was shown to be NP -complete by Karp et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. N P -completeness results for several related problems appear in a survey by Johnson [3]. As a result, most work concentrates on finding worst-case bounds and approximate solutions. One example is the work of Karp et al. [4]. <p> most w was shown to be NP -complete by Karp et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. N P -completeness results for several related problems appear in a survey by Johnson [3]. As a result, most work concentrates on finding worst-case bounds and approximate solutions. One example is the work of Karp et al. [4]. Their result is nearly tight | they show that any problem can be routed using one-bend routes and with channel width dN=2e + 1 and give an example of a routing problem which requires channel width bN=2c + 1. <p> We would therefore like to have an algorithm with a performance guarantee in terms of the optimal channel width for each problem. Such algorithms have been given by Karp et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, Burstein and Pelavin [2], Raghavan and Thompson [8, 9] and others. The general framework of most of these algorithms is to formulate the routing problem as an integer program, solve the linear programming relaxation, and then to round the fractional solution. <p> Since arbitrary rounding can be arbitrarily bad, we will use the following theorem due to Karp et al. The proof of the theorem is omitted and can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. [Rounding Theorem] Given A; b; x such that Ax = b, and given such that in every column of A, 1. the sum of the positive elements is , and 2. the sum of the negative elements is .

Reference-contexts: Whether or not any of these bounds can be further improved remains an interesting open question. Another problem arises when we consider a three-dimensional grid in place of a two-dimensional grid.

Reference-contexts: In general when k ' N , our channel width bound is z 1LP + O (log 2 k). The generalized routing problem has also been studied from a heuristic point of view by Li and Sadowska <ref> [7] </ref> and Vecchi and Kirkpatrick [12]. Both of these papers study the global routing of gate arrays and lack performance guarantees. However, they can route more than 6 two-point nets with more than one bend. Recently, Sarrafzadeh and Zhou [11] considered a restricted version of this problem.

Reference-contexts: The standard mathematical formulations of global routing are simple integer programs, so an obvious lower bound on the maximum channel width is the optimal value of the linear programming relaxation. The question then becomes, how good is this lower bound? Raghavan and Thompson <ref> [8, 9] </ref> used linear programming and a deterministic form of randomized rounding to produce a one-bend routing with channel width at most z 1LP + O ( p O (log N), where z 1LP is the value of the linear programming relaxation. <p> In this paper, we consider routing problems where we are given a bound k on the maximum wire length. For such a case, we improve the channel width bound to z 1LP + O (log 2 k), which is a substantial improvement over the results of Raghavan and Thompson <ref> [8, 9] </ref> when z 1LP is large or k is small. In general when k ' N , our channel width bound is z 1LP + O (log 2 k). <p> We would therefore like to have an algorithm with a performance guarantee in terms of the optimal channel width for each problem.
