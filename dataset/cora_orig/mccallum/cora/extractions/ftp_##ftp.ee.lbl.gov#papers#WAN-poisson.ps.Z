Abstract: Network arrivals are often modeled as Poisson processes for analytic simplicity, even though a number of traffic studies have shown that packet interarrivals are not exponentially distributed. We evaluate 24 wide-area traces, investigating a number of wide-area TCP arrival processes (session and connection arrivals, FTP data connection arrivals within FTP sessions, and TELNET packet arrivals) to determine the error introduced by modeling them using Poisson processes. We find that user-initiated TCP session arrivals, such as remote-login and file-transfer, are well-modeled as Poisson processes with fixed hourly rates, but that other connection arrivals deviate considerably from Poisson; that modeling TELNET packet interarrivals as exponential grievously underestimates the bursti-ness of TELNET traffic, but using the empirical Tcplib [Danzig et al, 1992] interarrivals preserves burstiness over many time scales; and that FTP data connection arrivals within FTP sessions come bunched into "connection bursts," the largest of which are so large that they completely dominate FTP data traffic. Finally, we offer some results regarding how our findings relate to the possible self-similarity of wide-area traffic.

Reference-contexts: In communications, heavy-tailed distributions have been used to model telephone call holding times [DMRW94] and frame sizes for variable-bit-rate video [GW94]. The discrete Pareto (Zipf) distribution <ref> [A83, p.95] </ref>: P [x = n] = 1=((n + 1)(n + 2)) for n 0: arises in connection with platoon lengths for cars at different speeds traveling on an infinite road with no passing [A83, p.95] [F66, p.40], a model suggestively analogous to computer network traffic. <p> The discrete Pareto (Zipf) distribution <ref> [A83, p.95] </ref>: P [x = n] = 1=((n + 1)(n + 2)) for n 0: arises in connection with platoon lengths for cars at different speeds traveling on an infinite road with no passing [A83, p.95] [F66, p.40], a model suggestively analogous to computer network traffic. Following [LTWW94], we define a distribution as heavy-tailed if: fi By this, we mean that for some fi and some constant c, the ratio P [X x]=(cx fi ) tends to 1 as x ! 1. <p> In contrast, for waiting times with a heavy-tailed distribution, the longer you have waited, the longer is your expected future waiting time. For the Pareto distribution with fi &gt; 1 (that is, with finite mean), the conditional mean exceedance is a linear function of x <ref> [A83, p.70] </ref>: The Pareto distribution is scale-invariant, in that the probability that the wait is at least 2x seconds is a fixed fraction of the probability that the wait is at least x seconds, for any x a. <p> A related result shows that the Pareto distribution is the only distribution that is "invariant under truncation from below" [M83, p.383] <ref> [A83, p.81] </ref>. That is, for the classical Pareto distribution, for y x 0 , Hence the conditional distribution is also a Pareto distribution, with the same shape parameter fi and new location parameter a 0 = x 0 . We make use of this property in the next section.

Reference-contexts: An important point is that such slow decline can also occur due to the presence of non-stationarity. In addition to looking at variance-time plots of the TELNET traffic, we also used Whittle's procedure [GW94, LTWW94] and Beran's goodness-of-fit test <ref> [B92a] </ref> to gauge the agreement between the traffic and the simplest type of self-similar process, fractional Gaussian noise [B92b]. All of the results are consistent with self-similarity on scales of tens of seconds or more. We postulate that two different mechanisms contribute to the apparent self-similarity of TELNET traffic.

This could be due to distorting effects of short-range dependence, better fits to other self-similar models such as fractional ARIMA processes <ref> [B92b] </ref>, or the presence of non-stationarity. WRL-3 was also the only dataset whose FTP traffic appears consistent with fractional Gaussian noise, though we have not assessed whether this coincidence is significant. Clearly, further work is required to fully understand the correlational structure of wide-area traffic.

In this case the process fX t g and the aggregated process fX (m) t g have the same autocorrelation function. From this result, for Pareto service times and an arbitrary arrival rate , the count process of the M/G/1 model is not exactly self-similar.

Reference-contexts: One generally assumes that each TELNET originator packet conveys one byte of user data, corresponding to a keystroke. Often, however, a packet carries more than one byte, either due to effects of the Nagle algorithm [N84] or because the TELNET connection is operating in "line mode" <ref> [B90] </ref> or "line-at-a-time mode" [PR83, S94]. For example, the LBL PKT-2 TELNET originator traffic comprised about 85,000 packets carrying 139,000 user data bytes. Given these difficulties, we attempted to fit the observed TELNET connection sizes (in packets) with another simple analytic distribution.

As has been shown by numerous researchers, such admissions control procedures could lead to a much more effective use of the available bandwidth [YKTH93].

Reference-contexts: A related, more precise notion of sustained correlation is that of "long-range dependence." A stationary process is long-range dependent if its autocorrelation function r (k) is nonsummable (i.e., P k r (k) = 1) <ref> [C84] </ref>. Thus, the definition of long-range dependence applies only to infinite time series. The simplest models with long-range dependence are self-similar processes, which are characterized by hyperbolically-decaying autocorrelation functions. <p> A second method for generating self-similar traffic that could fit TCP traffic is an M/G/1 queue model, where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and have service times drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution with infinite variance <ref> [C84, LTWW94] </ref>. In this model, X t is the number of customers in the system at time t. The count process fX t g t=0;1;2;::: is asymptotically self-similar (see Appendix D for further discussion). <p> In general, the slope of an arrival process's variance-time plot is a function of the process's autocorrelation function <ref> [C84] </ref>, and a long-range dependent process will exhibit slowly-decaying variances on such a plot. That is, the variance-time plot will decline in a more shallow fashion than with slope 1, though not necessarily in a straight line. <p> Finally, we should not underestimate the value of the fundamental insights and shifts in focus that come from considering questions of self-similarity and long-range dependence. D The M/G/1 model for generating self-similar traffic This section briefly discusses the M/G/1 model for generating self-similar traffic [CI80, p.136] <ref> [C84, p.67] </ref>. The M/G/1 queue model considers customers that arrive at an infinite-server queue according to a Poisson process with rate . In the count process fX t g t=0;1;2;::: produced by the M/G/1 queue model, X t gives the number of customers in the system at time t. <p> From [BSTW94], the process fX t g t=0;1;2;::: is exactly self similar only if r (k) = 1=2 (k + 1) 2k + (k 1) for 1=2 &lt; H &lt; 1 [BSTW94] <ref> [C84, p.59] </ref>. In this case the process fX t g and the aggregated process fX (m) t g have the same autocorrelation function. From this result, for Pareto service times and an arbitrary arrival rate , the count process of the M/G/1 model is not exactly self-similar.

Reference-contexts: Poisson arrivals have two key characteristics: the interarrival times are both exponentially distributed, and independent. We discuss testing for each in turn. For each interval, we test the interarrivals for an exponential distribution using the Anderson-Darling (A 2 ) test, recommended by Stephens in <ref> [DS86] </ref> because it is generally much more powerful than either of the better-known Kolmogorov-Smirnov or 2 tests. A 2 is also particularly good for detecting deviations in the tails of a distribution. <p> The second is that the number of data points tested also alters the significance levels. In general, the more points tested, the more likely the test will detect an incorrect null hypothesis. <ref> [DS86] </ref> gives procedures for incorporating both of these considerations into A 2 tests. We also need to test the interarrivals for independence. One indication of independence is an absence of significant autocorrelation among the interarrivals.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When modeling network traffic, packet and connection arrivals are often assumed to be Poisson processes because such processes have attractive theoretical properties [FM94]. A number of studies have shown, however, that for both local-area and wide-area network traffic, the distribution of packet interarrivals clearly differs from exponential <ref> [JR86, G90, FL91, DJCME92] </ref>. Recent work argues convincingly that LAN traffic is much better modeled using statistically self-similar processes [LTWW94], which have much different theoretical properties than Poisson processes. For self-similar traffic, there is no natural length for a "burst"; traffic bursts appear on a wide range of time scales. <p> However, the exponentially-distributed interarrivals commonly used to model packet arrivals generated by the user side of a TELNET connection grievously underestimate the burstiness of those connections, and high degrees of multiplexing do not help. Using the empirical Tcplib <ref> [DJ91, DJCME92] </ref> distribution for TELNET packet interarrivals instead results in packet arrival processes significantly burstier than Poisson arrivals, and in close agreement with traces of actual traffic. <p> model of TELNET traffic parameterized by only the hourly connection arrival rate and show that it accurately reflects the burstiness found in actual TELNET traffic. (We do not model the TELNET response, only the user side.) The success with this model of using Tcplib packet interarrivals confirms the finding in <ref> [DJCME92] </ref> that the arrival pattern of user-generated TELNET packets has an invariant distribution, independent of network details. <p> SYN/FIN packets are enough to measure connection start times (and hence connection arrival processes), durations, TCP protocol, participating hosts, and data bytes transferred in each direction. The BC and UCB traces are analyzed in depth in <ref> [DJCME92] </ref>, and also in [P94a], and the UCB trace forms the basis of the connection characteristics used for Tcplib [DJ91]. The NC, UK, and DEC traces are analyzed in [P94a], and the LBL traces are analyzed in [P94a, P94b]. <p> For the different protocols, we plot for each hour the fraction of an entire day's connections of that 1 The BC and UCB traces listed in Table 1 actually include all packets, and are analyzed as such in <ref> [DJCME92] </ref>. <p> Log10 Seconds -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 0.2 0.6 1.0 Tcplib PKT-1 trace Exp. fit #1 within TELNET connections. times of packets within TELNET connections.

To begin, x 3 showed that FTPDATA connection arrivals are not well-modeled as Poisson.

Reference-contexts: A valuable tool for assessing burstiness over different time-scales is the "variance-time plot" <ref> [LTWW94, GW94] </ref>, which we describe here by example rather than rigorously. Suppose we have a count process consisting of 72,000 observations, corresponding to a two-hour trace viewed every 0.1 seconds. Each observation gives the number of packet arrivals during that 0.1 second interval. <p> The simplest models with long-range dependence are self-similar processes, which are characterized by hyperbolically-decaying autocorrelation functions. Self-similar and asymptotically self-similar processes are particularly attractive models because the long-range dependence can be characterized by a single parameter, the Hurst parameter (which can be estimated using Whittle's procedure <ref> [GW94, LTWW94] </ref>). In the following sections, we look at ways in which long-range dependence in general, and self-similarity in particular, might arise in wide-area network traffic. <p> An important point is that such slow decline can also occur due to the presence of non-stationarity. In addition to looking at variance-time plots of the TELNET traffic, we also used Whittle's procedure <ref> [GW94, LTWW94] </ref> and Beran's goodness-of-fit test [B92a] to gauge the agreement between the traffic and the simplest type of self-similar process, fractional Gaussian noise [B92b].

Reference-contexts: This appendix discusses the Pareto distribution and its occurrence in the physical world. The classical Pareto distribution with shape parameter fi and location parameter a has the cumulative distribution function <ref> [HK80] </ref>: F (x) = P [X x] = 1 (a=x) ; a; fi 0; x a; with the corresponding probability density function: f (x) = fia x : If fi 2, then the distribution has infinite variance, and if fi 1, then it has infinite mean. <p> This definition includes the Pareto and Weibull distributions [DMRW94]. A more general definition of heavy-tailed defines a distribution as heavy-tailed if the conditional mean exceedance (CME x ) of the random variable X is an increasing function of x <ref> [HK80] </ref>, where CME x = E [X xjX x]: Using this second definition of heavy-tailed, consider a random variable X that represents a waiting time. For waiting times with a light-tailed distribution such as the uniform distribution, the conditional mean exceedance is a decreasing function of x.

Reference-contexts: A number of studies have shown, however, that for both local-area and wide-area network traffic, the distribution of packet interarrivals clearly differs from exponential [JR86, G90, FL91, DJCME92]. Recent work argues convincingly that LAN traffic is much better modeled using statistically self-similar processes <ref> [LTWW94] </ref>, which have much different theoretical properties than Poisson processes. For self-similar traffic, there is no natural length for a "burst"; traffic bursts appear on a wide range of time scales. <p> A valuable tool for assessing burstiness over different time-scales is the "variance-time plot" <ref> [LTWW94, GW94] </ref>, which we describe here by example rather than rigorously. Suppose we have a count process consisting of 72,000 observations, corresponding to a two-hour trace viewed every 0.1 seconds. Each observation gives the number of packet arrivals during that 0.1 second interval. <p> Recent work <ref> [LTWW94] </ref> shows that local-area Ethernet traffic (and perhaps wide-area TCP traffic) is much better modeled as a self-similar process, which displays substantially more bursti-ness over a wide range of time scales than do Poisson processes. <p> The simplest models with long-range dependence are self-similar processes, which are characterized by hyperbolically-decaying autocorrelation functions. Self-similar and asymptotically self-similar processes are particularly attractive models because the long-range dependence can be characterized by a single parameter, the Hurst parameter (which can be estimated using Whittle's procedure <ref> [GW94, LTWW94] </ref>). In the following sections, we look at ways in which long-range dependence in general, and self-similarity in particular, might arise in wide-area network traffic. <p> It may not be exactly right, but given our current understanding of networking phenomena, it appears in any case a good approximation. 9 7.2 Producing self-similar traffic There are several methods for producing self-similar traffic that could account for self-similarity in wide-area TCP traffic. As discussed in <ref> [LTWW94] </ref>, self-similar traffic can be produced by multiplexing ON/OFF sources that have a fixed rate in the ON periods and ON/OFF period lengths that are heavy-tailed (see Appendix B). <p> A second method for generating self-similar traffic that could fit TCP traffic is an M/G/1 queue model, where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and have service times drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution with infinite variance <ref> [C84, LTWW94] </ref>. In this model, X t is the number of customers in the system at time t. The count process fX t g t=0;1;2;::: is asymptotically self-similar (see Appendix D for further discussion). <p> The goal behind the method is to explore how a simple model of TELNET traffic might lead to self-similarity. We refer to this method as "pseudo-self-similar" because while the traffic it generates has large-scale correlations and the "visual self-similarity" property <ref> [LTWW94] </ref> over many time scales, we show in Appendix C that the traffic generated is not actually long-range dependent (and thus not self-similar). 7.3 Relating the methods to traffic models 7.3.1 TELNET As explained in [LTWW94], straight lines on variance-time plots with slopes more shallow than 1, such as that for <p> "pseudo-self-similar" because while the traffic it generates has large-scale correlations and the "visual self-similarity" property <ref> [LTWW94] </ref> over many time scales, we show in Appendix C that the traffic generated is not actually long-range dependent (and thus not self-similar). 7.3 Relating the methods to traffic models 7.3.1 TELNET As explained in [LTWW94], straight lines on variance-time plots with slopes more shallow than 1, such as that for the PKT-2 TELNET trace in Figure 5, are suggestive of self-similarity. <p> An important point is that such slow decline can also occur due to the presence of non-stationarity. In addition to looking at variance-time plots of the TELNET traffic, we also used Whittle's procedure <ref> [GW94, LTWW94] </ref> and Beran's goodness-of-fit test [B92a] to gauge the agreement between the traffic and the simplest type of self-similar process, fractional Gaussian noise [B92b]. All of the results are consistent with self-similarity on scales of tens of seconds or more. <p> The first three traces consist of between 1.7 and 2.4 million packets, and the last two traces each have around 1.3 million packets. The corresponding rates of packets/hour are above those of the "low hours" in <ref> [LTWW94] </ref>, so we would hope to find that the traces exhibit exact self-similarity. We see in Figure 12 that PKT-4 and PKT-5, the full link-level traces, both yield straight lines with shallow slope, consistent with asymptotic self-similarity for M 10 (0.1 second). <p> Thus, while large-scale correlations are clearly present in these traces, it might be difficult to characterize the correlations over the entire trace with a single Hurst parameter. WRL datasets listed in Table 2. The least active of the WRL datasets exceeds the most active in <ref> [LTWW94] </ref>, so we would again expect to find exact self-similarity. The variance-time plots for WRL-2 and WRL-4 are encouraging in this regard, lying in essentially straight lines for time scales of 0.1 seconds and higher. <p> that, in contrast to Poisson models, in reality "traffic `spikes' (which cause actual losses) ride on longer-term `ripples', that in turn ride on still longer-term `swells'." They suggest that a filtered variable can be used to detect the low-frequency component of congestion, giving some warning before packet losses become significant. <ref> [LTWW94] </ref> discusses some additional implications of long-range dependence of packet traffic. These include an explanation of the inadequacy of many commonly-used notions of burstiness, and the somewhat counter-intuitive observation that the modeling of individual connections can gain insight from an understanding of the fundamental characteristics of multiplexed traffic. <p> Following <ref> [LTWW94] </ref>, we define a distribution as heavy-tailed if: fi By this, we mean that for some fi and some constant c, the ratio P [X x]=(cx fi ) tends to 1 as x ! 1. This definition includes the Pareto and Weibull distributions [DMRW94]. <p> This means that over a large time scale, the predominance of bursts vs. lulls remains virtually unchanged: the process appears self-similar over many time scales. Figures 14 and 15 illustrate the "visual self-similarity" <ref> [LTWW94] </ref> of this process. Each figure plots 1,000 observations of the count process corresponding to i.i.d. Pareto interpacket times for fi = 1 and a = 1. Nine different random seeds were used in generating each figure.

Reference-contexts: Coalescing multiple FTPDATA connections into single burst (x 6) arrivals improves the 10-minute Poisson fit somewhat, but still falls short of statistical consistency. The finding that TELNET connection arrivals are well-modeled as a Poisson process with fixed hourly rates is at odds with that of <ref> [MM85] </ref>, who found that user interarrival times looked "roughly log-normal". We believe the discrepancy is due to characterizing the distribution of all of the interarrivals lumped together, rather than postulating separate hourly rates.

Putting all of this together, we have a complete model for TELNET traffic, FULL-TEL, parameterized only by the TELNET connection arrival rate. FULL-TEL uses Poisson connection arrivals, log-normal connection sizes (in packets), and Tcplib packet interarrivals. <p> We performed fitting of the upper tail of the distribution of data bytes per FTPDATA burst and found that the upper 5% tail fits well to a Pareto distribution with 0:9 fi 1:4 <ref> [P94a] </ref>. As the Pareto distribution is heavy-tailed (see Appendix B), this agrees with our findings in Figure 9. In contrast, the upper 0.5% tail of an exponential distribution always holds about 3% of the entire mass of the distribution, regardless of the distribution's mean.
