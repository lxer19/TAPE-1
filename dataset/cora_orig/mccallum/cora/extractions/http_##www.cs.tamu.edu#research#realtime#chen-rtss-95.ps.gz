Abstract: An important open problem is how resources in such networks should be managed in order to guarantee that the fault-tolerant real-time requirements of messages are met. This paper presents an efficient and practical solution to this problem. Our solution consists of off-line and on-line components. On-line management deals with run-time manipulation of messages and network resources. A message grouping approach simplifies on-line management. Off-line management deals with message grouping, bandwidth allocation and schedulability verification. Three approaches are investigated: spatial redundancy, temporal redundancy and an integrated approach. It is shown that the integrated approach has the best performance. Our solution is compatible with the FDDI and SAFENET standards.

An FBRN consists of r FDDI trunk rings, each trunk ring being composed of two counter-rotating fiber loops. Only one of these two loops is used for transmission and the other is reserved as back up.

Reference-contexts: An FBRN achieves a high degree of fault-tolerance by 1) using multiple FDDI ring networks to connect the hosts and 2) using efficient fault detection and network reconfiguration algorithms.

The problem of designing efficient reconfiguration algorithms for FBRN has been addressed in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. The reconfiguration algorithm developed in [3] is optimal in the sense that it always produces a configuration that has the largest number of functional rings for the given fault pattern. One disadvantage of the optimal algorithm is that it requires global information regarding the system fault status. <p> The problem of designing efficient reconfiguration algorithms for FBRN has been addressed in [3, 4].

In mission-critical systems, the communication overheads incurred in collecting this information may be intolerable. The local reconfiguration algorithm described in <ref> [4] </ref> does not suffer from this problem. The local algorithm operates in a fully distributed fashion utilizing only locally available information at each node. Further, with this algorithm, the reconfiguration process is transparent to the fault-free rings; the ongoing traffic on these rings is unaffected by the reconfiguration process. <p> Further, with this algorithm, the reconfiguration process is transparent to the fault-free rings; the ongoing traffic on these rings is unaffected by the reconfiguration process. Although the local algorithm is not optimal, it is demonstrated to have a near-optimal average case performance <ref> [4] </ref>. Hence, we employ the local reconfiguration algorithm. 5.4 Message Migration Once a fault condition is detected on a ring, the transmission of messages on that ring is disrupted. The messages on the affected ring may have to be migrated to some other ring.

Reference-contexts: The migration overhead constraint is needed to ensure that this overhead will not cause missing of deadlines. First, with FBRN architecture a ring failure can be detected in 2 TTRT time. Second, once a group migrates to another ring, the distributed mode change protocol <ref> [7] </ref> is invoked to drop the on-going transmissions and resume the transmission of the newly assigned group. Suppose K T T RT is the time taken for failure detection and mode change, which is also the maximum interruption time taken by a group migration caused by one ring failure. <p> If a group is migrated T i 1 times during its transmission, then in the worst case, its transmission will be interrupted by K (T i 1) TTRT time. An efficient mode change protocol with K = 3 has been introduced in <ref> [7] </ref>. According to the timing property of timed token protocol used by FDDI network, in order to guarantee the message deadline it is necessary that D i 2TTRT . <p> Here we compare the performance of pure temporal redundancy and pure spatial redundancy approaches with that of our integrated approach. We evaluate the performance through simulation. In the simulation we let K = 3 based on the mode change protocol described in <ref> [7] </ref>. We choose guarantee ratio, defined as the number of message sets guaranteed divided by total number of message sets generated, as our metric. The simulation program was written in C programming language and run in a Sun/Solaris environment. We consider an FBRN with 4 FDDI rings.

Reference-contexts: Constraint on Available Bandwidth For each copy of the message, sufficient synchronous bandwidth has to be allocated in order to meet its deadline requirement. Generally speaking, the smaller the deadline the larger is the bandwidth requirement. We use the local bandwidth allocation method proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>.
