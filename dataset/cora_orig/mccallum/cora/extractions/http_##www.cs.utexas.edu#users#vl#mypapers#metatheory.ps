Title: Toward a Metatheory of Action

Abstract: We present a formalization of the blocks world on the basis of the situation calculus and circumscription, and investigate its mathematical properties. The main theorem describes the effect of the circumscription which solves the frame problem in the presence of ramifications. The theorem is quite general, in the sense that it is applicable not only to the blocks world, but to a whole class of domains involving situations and actions. Its statement does not mention anything specific for the domain of blocks. Instead, it lists assumptions about purely formal, mostly syntactic, properties of the axiom set.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper we present a formalization of the blocks world on the basis of the situation calculus and circumscription, and investigate its mathematical properties. The formalization is not particularly original; it is based on the approach of <ref> [ Baker, 1989 ] </ref> 1 , and is in some ways similar to the formulation from Section 6 of [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] . <p> The language of a circumscriptive theory can be many-sorted and higher order. In most applications of circumscription, higher order variables do not occur in the axioms, and are only needed for forming the circumscription formula. Baker ( <ref> [ Baker, 1989 ] </ref> , Section 5) noticed, however, that predicate variables are useful for stating his "existence of situations" axioms, and we follow this approach in Section 2.2.

Reference-contexts: definition of circumscription to the case when some or all arguments of the circumscribed predicate are higher order variables is straightforward. 2 CIRC [A; P ; Z] stands for the result of circumscribing the predicate P in the sentence A with Z allowed to vary [ McCarthy, 1986 ] , <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] </ref> , [ Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987 ] . 2.2 AXIOMS FOR SITUATIONS AND FLUENTS First we describe the part of the axiom set which deals with situations and fluents; axioms for actions will be added in Section 2.3. <p> The circumscription CIRC [A; Frame; Inconsistent; Noninertial] (39) is equivalent to the conjunction of A and (14). Proof. By Proposition 2 from <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] </ref> , CIRC [A; Frame; Inconsistent; Noninertial] A ^ CIRC [(9Inconsistent; Noninertial:A); Frame] A ^ CIRC [A 0 ^ F ^ (9Inconsistent:S) ^U ^ C ^ R ^ P ^ (9Noninertial:I); Frame] A ^ CIRC [A 0 ^ F ^ U ^ C ^ R ^ P ; <p> The circumscription CIRC [A; Inconsistent; Holds; Result; Possible; Noninertial] (40) is equivalent to the conjunction of A and (16). Proof. Notice first that (40) is equivalent to A ^ CIRC [9Possible; Noninertial:A; Inconsistent; Holds; Result] (apply Proposition 2 from <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] </ref> to both circumscriptions).

Reference-contexts: According to part 2 of Condition B, C is equivalent, in the presence of A 0 , to a formula not containing Frame. Consequently, the conjunction A 0 ^U ^C^R^P is equivalent to a formula negative relative to Frame. By the lemma from Section 4 of <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1987 ] </ref> , it follows that CIRC [A 0 ^ F ^ U ^ C ^ R ^ P ; Frame] CIRC [F ; Frame] ^ A 0 ^ U ^ R ^ C ^ P: Hence CIRC [A; Frame; Inconsistent; Noninertial] A ^ CIRC [F ; Frame]: 4.4

We write IsState () for 8f [(f) Frame (f)]; and State [s] for f [Frame (f ) ^ Holds (f; s)]: Obviously, the formula 8s IsState (State [s]) is universally valid.

For instance, the configuration in which all blocks are on the table can be characterized by saying that the value of each of the fluents Ontable (x) is true. 3 By a "state" we understand a function assigning values to all frame fluents.
