Reference-contexts: To explore this area of research, we turn to the work of Anag-nostou and Corneil on the Minimum Weight Triangulation problem on point sets lying on the boundaries of nested convex hulls <ref> [1] </ref>. Using the dynamic programming techniques of Anagnostou and Corneil [1], and some ideas from Conn and O'Rourke [3] [4], we construct a MWCQ algorithm for a point set as follows. <p> To explore this area of research, we turn to the work of Anag-nostou and Corneil on the Minimum Weight Triangulation problem on point sets lying on the boundaries of nested convex hulls <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, relatively little published work has been done with regards to optimized convex quadrangulations of planar point sets. There have been some heuristic algorithms for generating "well-shaped" quadrangulations, notably the work of Bose and Toussaint <ref> [2] </ref> using algorithms based on a serpentine triangulation of the point set.

Reference-contexts: By modifying Keil and Sack's algorithm, Conn and O'Rourke <ref> [3] </ref> [4] constructed minimum weight convex quadrangula-tions of simple polygons and orthogonal polygons in O (n 3 log n) time and O (n 3 ) space. If the simple polygon does not admit a convex quad-rangulation, a value of infinity is returned for the minimum weight value. <p> Using the dynamic programming techniques of Anagnostou and Corneil [1], and some ideas from Conn and O'Rourke <ref> [3] </ref> [4], we construct a MWCQ algorithm for a point set as follows.

Reference-contexts: A minimum weight (minimum "ink") convex quad-rangulation with respect to a point set is a convex quadrangulation of S such that the sum of the Euclidean lengths of the line segments of the quadrangulation is minimised. 2 Previous Work Keil and Sack <ref> [5] </ref> and Lubiw [6] showed that a minimum weight convex quadrangula-tion (MWCQ) of a simple orthogonal polygon could be constructed in O (n 4 ) time and O (n 2 ) space using a straight forward dynamic programming algorithm.

Reference-contexts: on Algorithms and Data Structures, WADS '95, Tous-saint posed the problem of deciding whether one can "decide if a set of points admits a quad 1 rangulation where every quadrangle is convex?", noting that this question was first raised by Joe Mitchell at the MSI Workshop in Stonybrook in 1993 <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 MWCQ of a Constrained Point Set In our presentation, we will show how we extend the work for finding MWCQs to planar point sets, and thus present a partial answer to the question posed by Toussaint.
