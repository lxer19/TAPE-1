Abstract: To explore the nature of the representation space of 3D objects, we studied human performance in forced-choice classification of objects composed of four geon-like parts, emanating from a common center. The two class prototypes were distinguished by qualitative contrasts (bulging vs. waist-like limbs). Subjects were trained to discriminate between the two prototypes (shown briefly, from a number of viewpoints, in stereo) in a 1-interval forced-choice task, until they reached a 90% correct-response performance level. In the first experiment, 11 subjects were tested on shapes obtained by varying the prototypical parameters both orthogonally (Ortho) and in parallel (Para) to the line connecting the prototypes in the parameter space. For the eight subjects who performed above chance, the error rate increased with the Ortho parameter-space displacement between the stimulus and the corresponding prototype (the effect of the Para displacement was marginal). Clearly, the parameter-space location of the stimuli mattered more than the qualitative contrasts (which were always present). To find out whether both prototypes or just the nearest neighbor of the test shape influenced the decision, in the second experiment we tested 18 new subjects on a fixed set of shapes, while the test-stage distance between the two classes assumed one of three values (Far, Intermediate, and Near). For the 13 subjects who performed above chance, the error rate (on physically identical stimuli) in the Near condition was higher than in the other two conditions. The results of the two experiments contradict the prediction of theories that postulate exclusive reliance on qualitative contrasts, and support the notion of a metric representation space, with the subjects' performance determined by distances to more than one reference point or prototype (Edelman, 1995b).

Reference-contexts: Not all theories postulating a metric feature space as a substrate for recognition predict no effect for the proposed manipulation. For example, a theory according to which discrimination performance relies on the computation on distances to the class prototypes (Poggio and Edelman, 1990) and not to a decision surface <ref> (Ashby and Perrin, 1988) </ref> predicts that the performance will deteriorate the farther the stimuli are removed from the line connecting the two prototypes (see 2.1 Method Eleven subjects were trained to discriminate between the two prototypes in a 1-interval forced-choice task.

Reference-contexts: We chose this shape-space arrangement of stimuli because it offers an opportunity to test the predictions of a number of theories of object representation, and to evaluate these theories as models of recognition in human vision. Observe that the two class prototypes differed by a so-called qualitative contrast <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>: the sign of the bulge of the generalized-cylinder parts. <p> This finding indicates that the visual system is not likely to rely solely on the single most distinctive contrast between the categories, even if this contrast is "qualitative" or "nonaccidental" <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>. <p> In summary, the results of the two experiments we reported above contradict the prediction of theories of recognition that postulate exclusive reliance on qualitative contrasts <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref> or on proximity to a decision surface (Ashby and Perrin, 1988; Maddox and Ashby, 1993), and support the notion of a metric representation space, with the subjects' performance determined by proximities to more than one reference point or prototype (Nosofsky, 1988; Nosofsky, 1991; Edelman, 1995b; McKinley and Nosofsky, 1996;

Reference-contexts: processes and the representations involved in identifying specific individuals are different from those used for categorization (Jolicoeur, 1990) has been recently put to an explicit test in a series of experiments, in which objective similarity between stimuli (and, consequently, the categorical level of their distinction) varied in a controlled fashion <ref> (Edelman, 1995a) </ref>. Subjects in those experiments were trained to discriminate between two classes of computer generated 3D objects, one resembling monkeys, and the other dogs. Both classes were defined by the same set of 56 parameters, which encoded sizes, shapes, and placement of the limbs, the ears, the snout, etc. <p> After the subjects reached 90% correct performance on a fixed canonical view of each object, discrimination performance was tested for novel views that differed by up to 60 ffi from the training view. In all the experiments reported in <ref> (Edelman, 1995a) </ref>, higher inter-stimulus similarity was associated with an increase in the mean error rate and, for misorientation of up to 45 ffi , with an increase in the degree of viewpoint dependence. These results 2 parameters ("morphing") corresponds to a movement of the shape-space representation of the object. <p> For example, the experiments of (Bulthoff and Edelman, 1992) involved parametric control over viewpoint in two mutually orthogonal directions, whereas the study of <ref> (Edelman, 1995a) </ref> only manipulated the similarity between the two classes of stimuli, which is a scalar quantity. <p> According to the Nearest-Neighbor hypothesis, the performance on the test stimuli should not change under the proposed manipulation. In contrast, theories that postulate the involvement of all sufficiently close prototypes (Poggio and Edelman, 1990) predict that performance will improve as the distance between the two prototypes increases <ref> (Edelman, 1995a) </ref>. 7 experiment. The two prototypes, p 1 and p 2 , are as before. In this experiment, the location of p 1 relative to p 2 varied along the line connecting the two prototypes.
