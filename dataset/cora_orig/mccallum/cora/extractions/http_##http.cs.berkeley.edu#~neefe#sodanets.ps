Reference-contexts: Soda Hall is a new building and relatively few attempts have been made to document traffic patterns on its subnets. Several studies had been done of EECS traffic when the CS division was still in Evans Hall ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>) , but since the move to Soda network measurements have been limited. In figure 1, we list some information about each of the nets. <p> In addition, we were able to examine 36 hours of traces while in <ref> [2] </ref> they analyzed just over 2 hours of traffic. <p> This gives a feeling for the distribution of load attributing to the overall average. The 33 net consistently has fewer intervals in the range 0-1 Mbit/sec. It is also interesting to compare our load measurements to those observed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Their overall average network utilization was significantly higher than ours at 25%. They also observed less extreme burstiness at the 1 second granularity (minimum 1.6% and maximum 60.3%. At the one minute granularity, they observed a minimum of 8.8% and a mazimum of 38.6%. <p> This shows that a relatively small fraction of the total senders and receivers account for a large percentage of the bytes. The load is not evenly distributed among the active hosts. This is consistent with the data in <ref> [2] </ref>. For the 33 net, the most popular receiver is the multicast address. It accounts for 26.8% of the total bytes received on the 33 net and less than 0.1% of the total bytes for the 36 net. In [2], the multicast address was reported to be the receiver of 4.4% <p> This is consistent with the data in <ref> [2] </ref>. For the 33 net, the most popular receiver is the multicast address. It accounts for 26.8% of the total bytes received on the 33 net and less than 0.1% of the total bytes for the 36 net. In [2], the multicast address was reported to be the receiver of 4.4% of the bytes. Figures 19-22 take into account all of the senders and receivers. In figures 23-26, we consider only those machines on the net being observed. <p> In figure 28, we show the observed percentages of UDP, TCP and ICMP. The UDP and TCP figures are fairly consistent with <ref> [2] </ref> where they observed UDP to be 60% and TCP to be 22%. The large difference in ICMP percentage between the two Ethernets is due to a problem with the front end of the SP1 which is transmitting unnecessary packets. The responsible parties have been made aware of the problem.
