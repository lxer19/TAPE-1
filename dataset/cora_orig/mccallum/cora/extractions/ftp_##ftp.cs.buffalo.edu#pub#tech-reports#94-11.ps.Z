Reference-contexts: Various axiomatic systems of set theory have been developed; one standard is that called Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice, abbreviated ZF C. Its nine axioms follow, as given in <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 117] </ref> (who has avoided the use of abbreviations; see also [Kunen, 1980] for a comprehensive discussion with helpful intermediate definitions, and [Partee et al., 1990, page 218 ff.] for a slightly different exposition). <p> The Axiom of Foundation is, however, necessary to the application of transfinite induction as a proof technique [Kunen, 1980]. 3.3 The Anti-Foundation Axiom In his development of non-well-founded sets, Peter Aczel replaces the Axiom of Foundation with a strong negation, which he calls the Anti-Foundation Axiom, abbreviated AFA <ref> [Aczel, 1988] </ref>. To state it, we must define intermediate terms. Accessible Pointed Graph: An accessible pointed graph, or apg, is a directed graph with a dis tinguished node called the "point" from which every other node can be reached. <p> Because it is its own child, the solitary node would have to be decorated with something like this: fff: : :ggg. If only, as Aczel says, that expression "had an independently determined meaning!" <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 7] </ref> Lacking that, its decoration is a set defined to be "a set equal to its own singleton" [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 37]|still awkward. Indeed, that is the advantage of the picture representation. It obviates the need for distracting and arbitrary names. <p> The Anti-Foundation Axiom turns this possible decoration into a mandated decoration. Since the graph can be decorated that way, it must be. Both of the pictures in Figure 3.2 represent . Any graph in which all nodes have at least one child is a picture of <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 7] </ref>. Following the development of Barwise and Etchemendy, we now bring in a set of atoms A; a decoration of a graph then assigns to each childless node either an atom or the empty set. <p> then, the Solution Lemma is just a restatement of the Anti-Foundation Axiom, those who find its establishment of a unique solution too facile may take comfort in viewing the Solution Lemma as the axiom of interest, rather than as a result. 26 3.5 Analogy to a Ring of Polynomials In <ref> [Aczel, 1988, pages 11-12] </ref>, Aczel mentions that the technique of constructing sets by adjoining atoms to a given universe has an analogy in ring theory. <p> node n 2 MOLFULL (S 0 ) [ BASE (S 0 ) [ MOLATOM (S 0 ) [ SENSORY (S 0 ) can be decorated with ; 8n 2 S; (n) 6= . 41 Proof: can only decorate points of accessible pointed graphs in which every node has a child <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 7] </ref>. Since, by Axiom 4, every m 2 MOLFULL (S) heads a path to sensory nodes (which have no children) that entails set inclusion under the decoration D, then m 2 MOLFULL (S 0 ) cannot be decorated with , and consequently (m) 6= . <p> 0 (exert)g; fD 0 (m19); D 0 (m18); D 0 (m21)gg; ffD 0 (m19); D 0 (z)g; fD 0 (z); D 0 (m17)g; fD 0 (z); D 0 (m15)ggg = fffexertg; fm19; m18; m21gg; ffm19; zg; fz; m17g; fz; m15ggg The decoration can be viewed as the "unfolding" (Aczel's term <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 5] </ref>) of the set at the point, m20, into a tree apg of height ffi, as shown in Figure 5.4. <p> Recall that acyclic apgs are called "well-founded" and depict sets that are well-founded, for which the extensionality criterion says all there is to say about equality, and "by a transfinite induction on the membership relation the equality relation between well-founded sets is uniquely determined." <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 19] </ref>. For the difficult case (2), including infinite apgs, those that contain , and others that have no restrictions on the circularity of the decorations, Aczel's relation ` V ' captures the wide variation possible in apgs for the same hyperset (over some universe V). <p> ! x" means "all children x of a in the given apg of which a is the point".) A binary relation R is a bisimulation 55 a G 1 G 4 G 3 G 2 G 6 G 5 56 if and only if aRb =) aR + b, where <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 20] </ref>: aR + b () (8xja ! x)(9yjb ! y) xRy & (8yjb ! y)(9xja ! x) xRy Given any universe V of hypersets, the relation V on its members is the unique maximum bisimulation. <p> Aczel then shows that a V b if and only if there is an apg that is a picture of both a and b <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 21, Proposition 2.5] </ref>. This gives another way of stating the "permissiveness" of hyperset equivalence through apgs: Two hypersets are equivalent if they have any picture in common; never mind demonstrating that all pictures share some property. <p> bijection between the children of n 1 and n 2 for which Q holds; in either case, the conditions for H 1 V H 2 are satisfied. 2 Finally, Aczel provides a chain of implications to show that H 1 V H 2 implies that H 1 = H 2 <ref> [Aczel, 1988, pages 20, 21] </ref>, and we have the desired proof of identity of the hypersets, and assurance that the Delta-Graph Algorithm is correct. 5.6 Analysis of ffi -Values What types of hypersets are returned by the limited ffi ; how is the restricted circularity manifested? The decoration procedure in D <p> The canonical picture of a hyperset a contains only the nodes and arcs necessary to show the hereditary membership relations among the elements of a <ref> [Aczel, 1988, page 5] </ref>. By the Uniqueness Principle for SNePS, the decoration of any node n 2 SNodes will be injective, and therefore S ffi (n) will be a canonical picture.

Reference-contexts: By Mostowski's Collapsing Lemma, every well-founded graph has a unique decoration, with every childless node assigned the empty set and the same heredity property used to determine the sets that decorate parent nodes <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 41] </ref>. The introductory examples given using elements of the natural numbers N are illustrations. Here are some examples of non-well-founded sets. <p> If only, as Aczel says, that expression "had an independently determined meaning!" [Aczel, 1988, page 7] Lacking that, its decoration is a set defined to be "a set equal to its own singleton" <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 37] </ref>|still awkward. Indeed, that is the advantage of the picture representation. It obviates the need for distracting and arbitrary names. Even the name is unnecessary, of course, but useful, much like node labels in SNePS. <p> In ZF C + AF A, both z and its benign twin y = fx j x 2 xg are proper classes <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987] </ref>. 3.4 Solution Lemma Much of the appeal of Aczel's system ZF C + AF A lies in a consequence of the Anti-Foundation Axiom, the Solution Lemma, which establishes that a list of set-defining equations that express some "unknowns" in terms of hypersets over those unknowns themselves and <p> It is this technique that will be exploited to establish a semantic theory for circular phenomena such as exist in SNePS. Systems of equations and their solutions are built up as in algebra <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987] </ref>. The notation is dense, largely because it allows for infinite cases that will not be necessary for the present purposes. An example follows the definitions. <p> For example (from <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987] </ref>), consider the following system of equations for X = fx; yg, where M is an arbitrary atom: x = f; fxgg y = fM; x; yg So A, the given set of atoms, is simply fMg, and V A is all hypersets over fMg. <p> As developed by Peter Aczel under the rubric "non-well-founded set theory", these sets are denoted by directed graphs, with the directed arcs signifying membership. His theory "lets us bring to bear all of the familiar set-theoretic techniques to the problem of modeling circular phenomena." <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 58] </ref> We have seen that the theory of non-well-founded sets is an extension of classical set theory as it is commonly used in mathematics (that field having little need for the Axiom of Foundation). <p> was apparently "the first to see that AFA could be obtained from a coherent, intuitive conception of set, rather than just being a formally consistent axiom, and to demonstrate that it is an important mathematical tool for the modeling of various kinds of real-world circularity, not just a mathematical curiosity". <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 58] </ref> The purpose here is modelling of the circular semantics of SNePS, and we now turn to that. 28 Chapter 4 Circular Semantics in Network Models 4.1 Introduction In this chapter, the hyperset mechanism described in the previous chapter is applied to the problem of finding <p> Definition 4.7.8 sensetag : SENSORY (S 0 ) ! SA labeltag : MOLATOM (S 0 ) ! LA tag = sensetag [ labeltag Next we need to decorate S 0 by supplying a set for each node. Closely following the development given in <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, pages 39-40] </ref>, we do so respecting its given graph-theoretic structure, except that we decorate base nodes with their parent nodes' sets. We are decorating S 0 as if it were S fl , of course, but maintaining as much rigor as possible. <p> The steps given so far should be familiar, as they parallel the development in Chapter 4. Next is the development of the solution f and its verification. As in <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, pages 51-52] </ref>, we will methodically construct the solution from the apgs given directly by the equations, as shown in Figures 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8, and then combine them. <p> It consists of putting together the apgs for the hypersets over A [ X in such a way that an appropriate assignment to each unknown results, and doing so by following the method employed (or at least implied) by <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987] </ref>. <p> these graphs by replacing all edges terminating in a node tagged with x by an edge terminating in the top node of G x : : : " 51 f (b2) m24 m5 ask-whether Tom f (m24) ask-whether m5 f (m5) Tom 52 m5 ask-whether m23 f (m24) f (b2) <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 51] </ref>. <p> There is much more to investigate in , such as formulation of its solutions as the greatest fixed points of some operator using coinduction, the non-well-founded set counterpart of induction. A version of Aczel's Special Final Coalgebra Theorem should be developed specifically for SNePS. <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 56 ff.] </ref> The reader in search of an appealing informal semantics will be disappointed. Hypersets derived from SNePS networks seem even farther from English glosses or other paraphrases than are the 1 MINOR PROPHECIES, There Is No Natural Religion II 93 SNePS networks themselves. <p> Note that his complaint applies to well-founded semantic networks, insofar as their semantics depends on recursive enumerability. But we now have a difference in meaning that depends on "genuine structural difference" between graphs, since only such a difference suffices to distinguish one hyperset from another <ref> [Barwise and Etchemendy, 1987, page 40] </ref>.

Some other well-known knowledge representation systems, like KL-ONE <ref> [Brachman and Schmolze, 1985] </ref>, also incorporate intensionality (as discussed below). <p> The basic unit of cognition is the "structured conceptual object", or simply "Concept", the components of which are the "superConcepts" that subsume it, and the "Roles" and "Structural Description" that together constitute restrictions on the superConcepts. KL-ONE is also intended to represent intensionally <ref> [Brachman and Schmolze, 1985] </ref>. Any results derived herein that depend on the intensionality (only) of SNePS nodes would provide a rigorous distinction between it and non-intensional representations. <p> In KL-ONE, the subsump-tion question can also be answered by looking up a hierarchy, with one crucial difference 29 : : : the descriptions must be in their proper places in the network before any conclusions can be drawn. <ref> [Brachman and Schmolze, 1985, page 178] </ref> So there is nothing revolutionary in this treatment of arcs as set membership in a graph S 0 , and that will be the answer to question 1. The remaining specifications|the attribution of circular and atomic qualities|will require more discussion. <p> A Concept's meaning is strictly determined by its subsuming Concepts plus the information associated specifically with the Concept. <ref> [Brachman and Schmolze, 1985, page 181] </ref> To the developers of KL-ONE, of course, and to the conventional wisdom of knowledge representation, strict one-way semantic influence is a virtue.

Reference-contexts: Some semantic network researchers view the measure of distance between nodes (number of arcs, or, equivalently, length of the nrn-path) as suspect, and any attribution of significance to that distance as a misuse of the network model. (See, for example, 94 <ref> [Brachman et al., 1985, pages 415-416] </ref>.) But ffi explicitly makes this obvious notion of distance between nodes into a feature of the semantic theory.

Reference-contexts: Smith wants to have "lots of clouds", without counting the clouds. If that's all it is, then no; a system (such as SNePS) that embraces a "round square" won't shrink from "lots of clouds" <ref> [Cho, 1992] </ref>. 6 7. Do the representations capture all that matters? [Logic|Yes; CYC|Yes; EC|No.] Hard to say. Smith apparently wants to capture feedback, instinctual physical reactions, etc. 8. Are reasoning and inference central? [Logic|Yes, mostly; CYC|Yes; EC|Yes.] Yes. 9. <p> According to , SNePS does indeed have a single representational scheme; all nodes stand for hypersets. On the other hand, his examples of phenomena that resist capture by the Lenat and Feigenbaum frame-and-slot system|mass nouns, plurals, images <ref> [Srihari and Rapaport, 1990; Cho, 1992] </ref>|are easily captured as nodes in SNePS, with any peculiarity of property provided by, of course, connection to other nodes capturing those peculiarities. 6.

Reference-contexts: Oles apply the disciplined circularity of non-well-founded sets to the semantics of a term subsumption language, K-REP <ref> [Dionne et al., 1992] </ref>.

Terminological cycles, as noted by Nebel (cf. x 2.7.2), occur naturally in such a language, intended to capture word definitions.

Reference-contexts: Stated conversely, the meaning of a node cannot be determined by an examination of some proper subset of its neighboring nodes and arcs. As put in <ref> [Ehrlich and Rapaport, 1992, page 2] </ref>, describing work in progress: We take the meaning of a word (for a cognitive agent) to be the location of that word in a mental semantic network of words, propositions, and other concepts : : : .

Reference-contexts: instantiate the "is a function of" requirement. 65 Fodor and LePore put it this way, also as a property of languages: A language is compositional iff (idioms aside) the meaning of its syntactically complex expressions is a function of their syntatic structures together with the meanings of their syntactic constituents. <ref> [Fodor and LePore, 1991, page 332] </ref> They provide an enumeration of the manifestations of compositionality in natural language: productivity, "roughly, the fact that every natural language can express an open ended set of propositions"; systematicity, "roughly, the fact that any natural language that can express the proposition P will also be <p> is true, it is true because it is a fact about the world and not derivable from the meanings of the constituents (so compositionality is threatened), unless, of course, the meaning is taken to be distinct from the strictly analytic inferential power of the constituents (so the analytic/synthetic distinction returns). <ref> [Fodor and LePore, 1991] </ref> In natural language, compositionality is not a choice between well-formed alternatives. That is, non-compositionality is not a theory [Barbara Partee, personal communication]. It is not clear what the implications are, therefore, of a rejection of compositionality. <p> This is Fodor and Lepore's requirement of isomorphism <ref> [Fodor and LePore, 1991] </ref>. <p> forth, as well as sentences, formulae, and elements of language. [Smith, 1987, page 14] Fodor and Lepore ask "But what would a graded notion of compositionality be like? And, in particular, how would such a notion do what compositionality is required to do; viz. account for systematicity, isomorphism and productivity?" <ref> [Fodor and LePore, 1991, page 341] </ref>. Since they define systematicity as the ability to express propositions that are semantically close to P given the ability to express P, then provides it in a literal sense. <p> Since that is virtually impossible, we can conclude that the respective meanings of x are different from agent to agent. This is not as outrageous as it may seem (see <ref> [Fodor and LePore, 1991] </ref> for scornful remarks), since the full meaning of a node is irrelevant to virtually any application, which will necessarily be limited to calculation of to some SCOPE short of the full semantics.

Reference-contexts: that question is pursued, starting with a look at compositionality in general, and ending with consideration of the effects of the non-well-founded set semantics on the compositionality of SNePS. 6.2 Informal Definitions of Compositionality The Principle of Compositionality with regard to language is stated by a group of linguists in <ref> [Gamut, 1991, page 11] </ref> as "two principles of Frege": 1.

Reference-contexts: of a constituent is determined by one of several functions, with the selection of function being driven by some other parameter of the environment, such as the context of the sentence, is simply to defer the semantics to some "larger" function that takes that other parameter as an additional argument <ref> [Grandy, 1990] </ref>, [Partee et al., 1990, page 290], [Linguist List, 1991, Nerbonne (Vol. 2, No. 507), Fleck (Vol. 2, No. 523)]. 67 In fact, this is why both `kick' and `kick the bucket' can be accommodated.

Reference-contexts: regarded as its intensional definitions. 2.4 Graph Theory The abstract mathematical structure on which semantic nets in general rely is the graph, a set of discrete objects called nodes with connections called arcs between them, or, more specifically, the directed graph, a set of nodes with unidirectional arcs between them <ref> [Harary, 1972] </ref>. <p> a presentation of SNePS terminology.) Since SNePS allows more than one arc hn 1 ; n 2 i between the same two nodes n 1 and n 2 (as long as the arcs are labeled differently), the SNePS network is therefore, more precisely, a multigraph rather than a simple graph <ref> [Harary, 1972; Gibbons, 1985] </ref>. <p> We will also have occasion to use subgraphs induced by a set of arcs; the subgraph of G induced by E is G = V [ E , where a node v is in V if and only if there is some arc adjacent to it in the given E <ref> [Harary, 1972] </ref>. A SNePS network is not necessarily (weakly) connected, which would require that there be a semipath between every pair of points; though none of the examples used here show this, it is possible that a SNePS network could include several separate subnetworks, that is, disconnected components. <p> An easy consequence of these properties is that there must exist, in every network (at least, in S 0 form), nodes with indegree zero <ref> [Harary, 1972, Theorem 16.2 0 ] </ref>. In fact, there is a unique minimal set of such points that, between them, allow all other nodes to be reached along some path [Harary, 1972, Theorem 16.6], called the point basis. <p> In fact, there is a unique minimal set of such points that, between them, allow all other nodes to be reached along some path <ref> [Harary, 1972, Theorem 16.6] </ref>, called the point basis.

Reference-contexts: Barbara Partee surveyed, explained, and critiqued the various points of view in [Partee, 1984]. Recently (late 1991), a question about the nature of non-compositional semantics generated discussion on the LINGUIST LIST, an electronic bulletin board, with particular contributions mentioned below <ref> [Linguist List, 1991] </ref>. 6.3.1 The Troublesome Constructions For English, the syntactic domain Y is words or other constituents (the atoms A) and sentences (the compound objects B), and the semantic domain Z is the meanings of words, phrases, other constituents, and sentences. <p> But the following sentences are not so easy to interpret this way: S1: Susan dated an occasional sailor. <ref> [Linguist List, 1991, Hutchinson (Vol. 2, No. 507)] </ref> S2: Fifty is what forty used to be. (G. Steinem, cited by [Wilks, 1984]) These examples are meaningful to English speakers, but not in a way that easily reflects a combination of the meanings of their words. <p> Consider pluralization in general. In the word `dogs', the constituent that marks that the semantics is plural is the `-s' suffix. What then is the marker for singular in `dog' ? One hypothesis is a zero (empty) morpheme <ref> [Linguist List, 1991, Fintel (Vol. 2, No. 523)] </ref>, a solution with some respectability. But extrapolation would require a zero morpheme for all unmarked features of words. In other words, it is not enough to claim that default cases hold unless otherwise specified. <p> Idioms, such as "kick the bucket", present no qualitative challenge to a semantics that otherwise employs standard meanings for the three constituent words, as long as that semantics recognizes the three-word string and computes its meaning independently of the individual words in it <ref> [Linguist List, 1991, Manaster-Ramer, Coates; (Vol. 2, No. 514)] </ref>. Note that this requires the set of base, or atomic, elements to include both `kick' and `kick the bucket'. Compositional functions can return sets. A function whose range includes sets is still a function. <p> The problems involved in determining the scope and values of the relevant inputs is enormous, but they are not different in kind from those of isolating, into discrete units, the semantic contributions of the constituent or sentence itself [Partee et al., 1990, pages 293-294], <ref> [Linguist List, 1991, Nerbonne (Vol. 2, No. 507)] </ref>. Compositionality cannot extend only part of the way. To say that some linguistic constructions can be interpreted compositionally but others cannot is to beg the question.

Reference-contexts: There is no neat separation into independent levels of knowledge.

Most of the well-known knowledge/belief representation systems either ignore them or explicitly exclude them, but they are useful and common. Nebel says that these reasons are enough to analyze them, and the difficulty of doing so is not reason enough not to.

(See "bottom-up" versus "top-down" interpretation, <ref> [Partee et al., 1990, pages 286-287] </ref>.) Yorick Wilks argues that the principle of compositionality in natural language is either trivial or false|false for the reasons given in the examples above, or trivial in that nothing is ever taken as refuting it. <p> constituent is determined by one of several functions, with the selection of function being driven by some other parameter of the environment, such as the context of the sentence, is simply to defer the semantics to some "larger" function that takes that other parameter as an additional argument [Grandy, 1990], <ref> [Partee et al., 1990, page 290] </ref>, [Linguist List, 1991, Nerbonne (Vol. 2, No. 507), Fleck (Vol. 2, No. 523)]. 67 In fact, this is why both `kick' and `kick the bucket' can be accommodated. <p> The problems involved in determining the scope and values of the relevant inputs is enormous, but they are not different in kind from those of isolating, into discrete units, the semantic contributions of the constituent or sentence itself <ref> [Partee et al., 1990, pages 293-294] </ref>, [Linguist List, 1991, Nerbonne (Vol. 2, No. 507)].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the interpretation of a node is affected by connecting nodes (other concepts), which may in turn influence it. Relief from this circularity is provided by sensory nodes, which are external inputs like lexemes and mechanical outputs like actions <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987; Rapaport, 1988b; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991] </ref>. To say that a node represents a concept is not sufficient. We need to talk about which concept, how the concept can be described, and how it relates to others, and how it can be distinguished from them.

Its use for the semantics of semantic network representation systems in general, and SNePS in particular has been explored in <ref> [Rapaport, 1978; Rapaport, 1981; Rapaport, 1985b; Rapaport, forthcoming] </ref>.

Dependent on taxonomy and subsumption, it makes properties, rather than propositions, primary.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the claim that a semantic network is redundant to first-order logic has been revived by Lenhart Schubert: All KR schemes I have lately encountered, which aspire to cope with a large, general propositional knowledge base, qualify as semantic nets, appropriately viewed. <ref> [Schubert, 1991, page 96; italics his] </ref> He proposes to reserve the term `semantic net' for models that are truly dependent on graph-theoretic characteristics|topological, dynamic, or other. The study described here seeks such characteristics of SNePS. The question is of great importance for the entire field of knowledge representation. <p> It would make "essential use of nontrivial graph-theoretic properties" <ref> [Schubert, 1991, page 106] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: of the knowledge representation and reasoning system SNePS ("Semantic Network Processing System") for cognitive modeling takes as its fundamental constructive principle that representation of all concepts (things, propositions, and all other phenomena) is done through nodes in a network, thereby providing a circumscribed set of meaning-bearing objects as defined in <ref> [Shapiro, 1979; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991] </ref>. It embraces intensionality, as opposed to otherwise similar approaches, as discussed briefly in the introduction to [Maida and Shapiro, 1982] in [Brachman and Levesque, 1985, page 169]. <p> Furthermore, the interpretation of a node is affected by connecting nodes (other concepts), which may in turn influence it. Relief from this circularity is provided by sensory nodes, which are external inputs like lexemes and mechanical outputs like actions <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987; Rapaport, 1988b; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991] </ref>.

We need to talk about which concept, how the concept can be described, and how it relates to others, and how it can be distinguished from them. <p> Meta-predicates are used to control deduction, separating, for instance, subconscious from conscious belief. The paper cited shows that SNePS is not reducible to first-order logic. Individual nodes are meant to have intensional interpretations, so that everything, including imaginary and impossible objects, can have a place in a mental model <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991] </ref>. An appropriate domain is developed in the work of the philosopher Alexius Meinong, who called it Aussersein. <p> SNePS has a commitment to natural language as the interface and therefore as a de facto functional definition of the system <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991] </ref>. The interpretation and generation of natural languages is a vast and active area of artificial intelligence research. <p> This type of study is complementary, rather than parallel, to the present concern. 1.4 Some Specific Motivational Questions Suppose we intend to use a knowledge representation and reasoning system such as SNePS to model the mind of a cognitive agent, as in <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>. Consider a SNePS node n, and consider its meaning [[n]], where "meaning" is to be taken here in the sense of [Shapiro, 1991] (which is the source of the notation) as an undefined intuitive term. <p> Other graph-theoretic concepts also translate easily between the language of SNePS and the language of graph theory; for example, a base node has an outdegree of zero, and it is the rules for building networks (see <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>) that make them acyclic. An easy consequence of these properties is that there must exist, in every network (at least, in S 0 form), nodes with indegree zero [Harary, 1972, Theorem 16.2 0 ]. <p> does not believe that marzipan is delicious, has a crack at concocting a confection pleasing to cognitive agent D, who does believe that marzipan is delicious|either by, crudely put, actively figuring out D's taste, or by realizing something about D's taste. (The definitions sketched above can be found mainly in <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, [Shapiro, 1991], and [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991].) An example of a SNePS network is shown in Figure 2.1, the representation in the cognitive agent CASSIE of the sentence "John believes that the girl next door is sweet," from [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991]. <p> Indeed, a major thrust of the study is to clarify and legitimize those features. This analysis is nominally directed at full SNePS, although we are primarily interested in its role as a cognitive agent, such as CASSIE in the research project SNePS/CASSIE <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>. The distinction will be drawn when necessary. The mechanics of the current implementation of SNePS, SNePS-2.1, are described in [Shapiro and Group, 1989]. The major constructor is the BUILD command, which adds nodes, and thereby information, to networks. <p> When it is necessary to refer to classes of structures formally, the following terms will be used: Definition 2.6.1 SNodes: the set of all well-formed SNePS/CASSIE proposition nodes, as specified by the generation rules SR.i <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, and the assumption that base nodes are given. Definition 2.6.2 SNets: the set of all well-formed SNePS networks, as specified by the generation rules SR.i [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987], and the assumption that base nodes are given. 2.6.3 Intensionality is incorporated through Aussersein Let D name the <p> will be used: Definition 2.6.1 SNodes: the set of all well-formed SNePS/CASSIE proposition nodes, as specified by the generation rules SR.i <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, and the assumption that base nodes are given. Definition 2.6.2 SNets: the set of all well-formed SNePS networks, as specified by the generation rules SR.i [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987], and the assumption that base nodes are given. 2.6.3 Intensionality is incorporated through Aussersein Let D name the domain of entities represented by SNePS nodes. As discussed in x1.3.2, D can also be regarded as the Meinongian domain Aussersein|at least, for individual, proposition, and rule nodes. <p> more rigorous way than describing it in Aussersein terms as "everything we can talk and think about" [Rapaport, 1978]. 2.7 Fundamental Principles of SNePS 2.7.1 Avowed principles As described in the previous chapter, certain principles of SNePS stated in the literature are meant to distinguish SNePS from other cognitive models <ref> [Rapaport, 1985a; Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>. * Intensionality: SNePS is (or allows) a fully intensional representation of belief; the nodes represent concepts ("objects of thought"), not limited to extensional or possible objects. * The Uniqueness Principle: The relation between the cognitive agent's concepts and the nodes in the network is a <p> A (molecular) node in S 0 will be construed as a set in the standard hereditary sense, so that its "members" are its immediately subordinate nodes, following the directed arcs formed under the SR.i rules of <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>. <p> Semantics for Base Nodes A base node must mean something. The theory of SNePS has heretofore been able to provide semantics for molecular nodes, as in the SI.i rules of <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, but not for base nodes. The semantic function provides a complete semantics, assigning meanings, sets of relationships rooted in the sensory interface, to all SNePS nodes. 2. <p> These alternatives are discussed independently, so the reader should not assume that the modification of one section builds on that of the previous one. 7.2 Alternative Semantics to Handle Arc Labels What is the role of arc labels, and what exactly is the nature of their "punctuation" function? In <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, the two networks given by syntactic rules SR.4 and SR.5 differ only in that one has an arc labeled PROPERTY and the other has an arc in the same position labeled PROPER-NAME; the two networks have different semantics, as expressed in the semantic rules SI.4 and SI.5. <p> failed attempts show that "nodifying" relations, to construct from a SNePS network a graphical structure of only nodes and homogeneous connections for Aczel's theory, does not work. 7.2.2 Case frames It is case frames that are considered to be the units of meaning in the semantic interpretation rules SI.i of <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, which give the semantic domain Z as English statements. SI : f SNePS case frames from SR rules g ! f English statements g Although appealing in its own way, it is a different semantics. <p> No means of providing circularity (in base nodes, to which further concepts can be attached) would escape that necessity. Little has been said about the "semantic interpretation" rules SI.i of <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987] </ref>, which offer a semantics of SNodes as English glosses.

According to <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991, page 221] </ref>, The entity represented by a node is determined in one of two ways: it is determined assertionally by the subnetwork connected to the node via arcs pointing into it; it is determined structurally by the subnetwork connected to the node via arcs pointing out of <p> And would -0 then become too liberal? It would accept and interpret sentences such as "Susan dated an often sailor," which are (probably) not valid. 6.5 Compositionality in SNePS The design and development of SNePS is driven, to some extent, by the requirements of natural language (English) competence <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991] </ref>. <p> Shouldn't the full meaning of that BELIEF node somehow take into account those assertions? The most telling argument that a node for `belief' must exist in a (fully-developed) cognitive agent is that a cognitive agent "must be able to represent other cognitive agents, both as objects and agents of belief" <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991, page 217] </ref>. 89 2. Now consider a node labeled `belief'. Is the lexical assignment necessary? By the Uniqueness Principle, if there is a node standing for `belief' at all, it must be the one to which the label (via LEX arc) is attached. <p> Additional suggestions for research are offered, especially to clarify the relationship of SNePS with to other issues and theories in artificial intelligence. 8.2 A Formal Semantics for SNePS SNePS needs a semantics for base nodes and a theoretical foundation providing the circularity in its semantics that is referred to in <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991, pages 221-222] </ref>. The non-well-founded set theory of Peter Aczel offers a rigorous mathematical development of set-theoretic objects that may contain themselves. The semantic function offered herein provides a semantics for SNePS, based on non-well-founded set theory, which incorporates the notion of circularity in base nodes. <p> The semantic investigation culminating in is meant to provide some foundation for it. 8.3 Legitimizing Circularity in Semantics Shapiro and Rapaport, after describing the circularity of SNePS, refer to sensory nodes as "a major escape from this circularity" <ref> [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991, page 222] </ref>. Evidently, circularity is to be acknowledged but held in check, a reasonable attitude.

Reference-contexts: a special semantic manifestation. (In other words, will act nodes require special interpretation mechanisms?) Recent work concerning subconscious reasoning and the assertional status of propositional nodes suggests that a possible semantics of a network is "derived by taking all the atomic formulae conjunctively, and path-based inference rules are straight-forward conditionals" <ref> [Shapiro, 1991, page 3] </ref>, and considers the inference mechanisms appropriate to this view. Meta-predicates are used to control deduction, separating, for instance, subconscious from conscious belief. The paper cited shows that SNePS is not reducible to first-order logic. <p> Consider a SNePS node n, and consider its meaning [[n]], where "meaning" is to be taken here in the sense of <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref> (which is the source of the notation) as an undefined intuitive term. <p> A leaf, in other words, or any other node with no children, has outdegree zero, while the root of a tree has indegree zero. A SNePS network is often described as "a directed acyclic graph" <ref> [Shapiro, 1991, page 137] </ref>. (See x2.5 for a presentation of SNePS terminology.) Since SNePS allows more than one arc hn 1 ; n 2 i between the same two nodes n 1 and n 2 (as long as the arcs are labeled differently), the SNePS network is therefore, more precisely, a <p> Nodes that do have arcs emanating from them, i.e., that dominate others, are called molecular. They include (1) structured individual nodes and (2) structured proposition nodes. The formal definitions that will be needed follow <ref> [Shapiro, 1991, page 145] </ref>: Definition 1 A wire is an ordered pair hr; ni, where r is a SNePS relation, and n is a SNePS node. <p> marzipan is delicious, has a crack at concocting a confection pleasing to cognitive agent D, who does believe that marzipan is delicious|either by, crudely put, actively figuring out D's taste, or by realizing something about D's taste. (The definitions sketched above can be found mainly in [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987], <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref>, and [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991].) An example of a SNePS network is shown in Figure 2.1, the representation in the cognitive agent CASSIE of the sentence "John believes that the girl next door is sweet," from [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1991]. <p> The major constructor is the BUILD command, which adds nodes, and thereby information, to networks. It also reinforces the Uniqueness Principle (see x2.7) by only constructing nodes that do not already exist. 2.6.1 Standard model-theoretic semantics If SNePS is a formal propositional system, as stated in <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref>, then a truth-functional semantics is a standard choice, assigning to a proposition node a member of the domain ftrue, falseg, to an individual node an extensional constant or atom, and to a rule node a function from closed sentences to ftrue, falseg [Rapaport, 1992a; Rapaport, 1992b]. <p> Shapiro also gives a dynamic belief semantics, through path-based inference <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref>. The semantics of acts remains to be specified, and is the subject of current research [Kumar and Shapiro, 1991]. <p> discourse is determined by the meaning of `water'." He then acknowledges that this view "challenges the traditional view that semantics can be `compositionally' defined on top of a base set of atomic values" [Smith, 1991, pp. 265 ff.]. 2.8 The Need for Further Analysis 2.8.1 Semantics of base nodes While <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref> addresses the semantics of molecular nodes, especially as regards their asser-tional (and therefore inferential) status, it does not provide a meaning for base nodes independent of their syntactic placement. 2.8.2 Semantics of molecular nodes Somehow we want the meaning of a node to be its location in a network, <p> It would be complementary to the "subconscious" reasoning provided by path-based inference <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref>. SCOPE may be seen as the institutionalization of the distinction between competence and performance. In natural language processing research, competence yields theoretical results such as grammars for languages of infinite cardinality, and performance explains why human speakers do not always act in accordance with those results. <p> All of them treat SNePS arcs as defining hereditary membership. A node n 1 is a member of the set assigned to the node n 2 if there is an arc from n 2 to n 1 . In other words, the definition from <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref> of the membership of a wire hr; ni in a cableset (molecular node) m will be a sufficient condition for n's membership in m's hyperset|but not a necessary condition, as we shall see in the development of answers to question 2. <p> A (molecular) node in S 0 will be construed as a set in the standard hereditary sense, so that its "members" are its immediately subordinate nodes, following the directed arcs formed under the SR.i rules of [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987]. Support for this simple view comes from <ref> [Shapiro, 1991, page 146] </ref>: "... a node is determined by the arcs emanating from it, not by the arcs pointing into it." For the intital development, the arc label will be ignored, but since it contributes to the meanings of the two nodes connected, eventually (x7.2.4), it will be incorporated by <p> In other words, every node in SNodes has at least one arc attached to it, either incoming or outgoing; there are no isolated nodes. For a statement of this principle, see <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref>. Axiom 2 Every SNePS network S 2 SNets is finite, with a finite set of nodes V and a finite set of arcs E. Axiom 3 Every full network S 2 SNets contains sensory nodes. <p> participates in the meaning of a node (that is, what other nodes) without making a commitment as to how, and could be applied (with its handling of circularity) to any graphically structured knowledge/belief representation|even those that do not allow propositions modelled to have multiple arguments in a single position (see <ref> [Shapiro, 1991, page 138ff.] </ref> for comparison). 83 7.3 Acquisition, Reference, and Retention of a Concept Let us attempt to reconsider some questions of x 1.4 in light of the foregoing analysis: * Suppose [[n]] is C's concept of Perdita's old car. Suppose [[m]] is D's concept of Perdita's old car. <p> The current theory of SNePS supports neglect of the semantic influence of assertion: ": : : the `!' does not affect the identity of the node, nor the proposition it represents" <ref> [Shapiro, 1991, footnote 2] </ref>. Here is the problem: Consider two agents, C and D, with two nodes, n C and n D , identical (or at least identical as far as the current scope is defined) except that n C is not asserted, and n D is. <p> Although it is a fundamental notion, there is no evidence that cognitive agents must have that notion before they can assert propositions. In SNePS, the necessary reasoning is provided by path-based inference <ref> [Shapiro, 1991] </ref>, which does not rely on any conceptualization of its mechanism. But human cognitive agents do eventually acquire the notion of belief, presumably as a node, while entertaining actual beliefs, asserted propositions, also.

Reference-contexts: A modern exemplar is Jeffrey Siskind, who presents an operational system that acquires some semantics along with syntax, building structures embodying restricted word meanings from a stream of both linguistic and restricted empirical input, both in symbolic form <ref> [Siskind, 1990] </ref>. This type of study is complementary, rather than parallel, to the present concern. 1.4 Some Specific Motivational Questions Suppose we intend to use a knowledge representation and reasoning system such as SNePS to model the mind of a cognitive agent, as in [Shapiro and Rapaport, 1987].

Reference-contexts: Brian Cantwell Smith captures the common view that knowledge must be representational in his Knowledge Representation Hypothesis, which suggests that success in designing a cognitive model| perhaps a semantic network; perhaps, indeed, SNePS|is both necessary and sufficient to the endeavor of artificial intelligence <ref> [Smith, 1982] </ref>. From Smith also comes a provocative paper calling for 4 a new focus, in AI research, on the middle ground between theory and prototype, to be discussed later in this chapter.

Reference-contexts: m iff (n) 6= (m). "Even in cases where there is a simple correspondence of objects, as when the numeral 3 stands for the number three, it is really the object's being that and not some other numeral that corresponds to the number's being that and not some other number." <ref> [Smith, 1987, page 11] </ref> 42 Proof: (1) Assume n = m in SNodes. Then, by the recursive rules for well-formed SNePS nodes SR.i, they are required to have the same identifier. <p> If the part/whole relation is itself absorbed, a very strong version of compositional correspondence obtains, where parts of a source correspond to parts of the target. <ref> [Smith, 1987, page 11] </ref> Partee et alia offer the following definition of compositionality (calling it "Frege's principle") to open their comprehensive look at the subject as a linguistic property, followed in the case of formal languages, and sought in the case of natural languages: The Principle of Compositionality. <p> In fact, according to Smith, it can hardly be helped: So the metaphysical problem for semantical theorists is not one of referring to the world by using theoretical language, but rather something closer to the opposite: there is no way of referring to the world except by using language. <ref> [Smith, 1987, page 16; emphasis his] </ref> The considerations given for natural language apply to SNePS, insofar as the meaning of a node is intended to be expressible. <p> : : : we should license a full range of types of correspondence, kinds of circumstantial dependence, and varieties of registration (continuous, discrete, compositional), in terms 75 of which subsequently to characterise pictures, maps, graphs, schedules, models, images, and so forth, as well as sentences, formulae, and elements of language. <ref> [Smith, 1987, page 14] </ref> Fodor and Lepore ask "But what would a graded notion of compositionality be like? And, in particular, how would such a notion do what compositionality is required to do; viz. account for systematicity, isomorphism and productivity?" [Fodor and LePore, 1991, page 341].

Reference-contexts: the SNePS representation provide the impetus to examine the computations necessary to the determination of [[n]]. 1.5 Some Broad Motivational Questions Brian Cantwell Smith has proposed twelve foundational questions to be asked of a reasoning or inference system, as a means of placing it in the theoretical space of AI <ref> [Smith, 1991] </ref>. His twelve questions provide something of a new manifesto for artificial intelligence, and are worth applying to any knowledge/belief representation system; here we apply it to SNePS. <p> Smith answers his twelve questions in terms of (1) the traditional approach of predicate logic, (2) the CYC system proposed by Dougles B. Lenat and Edward Feigenbaum [Lenat and Feigenbaum, 1991], and (3) his admittedly ill-defined "minimum standard for an AI system," called embedded computation, or EC <ref> [Smith, 1991, page 259] </ref>. The questions appear below, with Smith's answers provided in square brackets, followed by preliminary answers for SNePS, to be reviewed in the conclusion. 1. <p> of `water' is as much determined by the meaning of the discourse as the meaning of the discourse is determined by the meaning of `water'." He then acknowledges that this view "challenges the traditional view that semantics can be `compositionally' defined on top of a base set of atomic values" <ref> [Smith, 1991, pp. 265 ff.] </ref>. 2.8 The Need for Further Analysis 2.8.1 Semantics of base nodes While [Shapiro, 1991] addresses the semantics of molecular nodes, especially as regards their asser-tional (and therefore inferential) status, it does not provide a meaning for base nodes independent of their syntactic placement. 2.8.2 Semantics of <p> Evidently, circularity is to be acknowledged but held in check, a reasonable attitude. As Smith puts it, "Making interpretation dependent on use, at least at first blush, therefore gives one every reason to suppose that the notion of soundness is rendered circular, hence vacuous" <ref> [Smith, 1991, page 266] </ref>. The first challenge, then, to any semantic theory that embraces circularity is to counteract the instinct to fear it as destructive. The problem with circularity is the lack of a basis for computation. <p> (not just a communicative one) can crucially involve non-representational phenomena, as well as representational ones. [This] is a claim that the millenial story about intelligence won't consist solely of a story about representation, but will inevitably weave that story together with analyses of other non-representational aspects of an intentional agent. <ref> [Smith, 1991, page 273] </ref> It appears that the "right" answer to this question would only be provided by a proof that there are phenomena of intelligence that SNePS with not only does not, but cannot, capture. <p> in a way described by Smith in his discussion of question 3: ": : : much of the structure of argument and discourse|even the raison d'^etre of rationality|involves negotiating in an intentional space where meanings are left fluid by our linguistic and conceptual schemes, ready to be grounded in experience." <ref> [Smith, 1991, page 267] </ref> Grounding in sensory data, and soon, it is to be hoped, in act nodes, is an important feature of . 10. Is physical embodiment important? [EC|Yes.] It is sensory nodes that serve as atoms over which to form hypersets that become the meanings of the nodes.

Reference-contexts: They are a special type of node with indegree one and outdegree one: m jPROPERTY These are reminiscent of Conceptual Graphs <ref> [Sowa, 1984] </ref>, but do not belong here. Such an alternative is unprincipled in its violation of the Uniqueness Principle. A SNePS network cannot contain multiple nodes standing for "PROPERTY", i.e., multiple nodes n such that [[n]] = PROPERTY. 2. Perhaps they are molecular nodes, one for each possible relation.

Reference-contexts: paraphrase: ~ [[ [ E 1 =I ] E 0 ]] = ~ [[E 0 ]] ( [ ~ [[E 1 ]] =I ] ) This states that the result of evaluating a substituted expression in some environment is the same as evaluating the original expression in a modified environment. <ref> [Stoy, 1977, page 161] </ref> If we regard substitution of one expression for another (E 1 for I in E 0 ) as syntactic manipulation, and modification of an environment () as semantic manipulation, then licensing of substitution amounts to the same thing as the commutativity of syntactic and semantic transformation as

Consider pluralization in general. In the word `dogs', the constituent that marks that the semantics is plural is the `-s' suffix.

Reference-contexts: Undisciplined application of this approach raised the problems discusssed by William A. Woods, who called on semantic network modelers to provide a theory grounding their use of the constructs <ref> [Woods, 1975] </ref>. No matter what the model chosen, standard extensional ways of assigning meanings to the terms involved have proven unsatisfactory. Their interpretation as external objects and phenomena in the real world, for example, does not allow direct representation of fictional, imaginary, or impossible entities. <p> But logic is indispensable, and it is also an integral facility of SNePS. The treatment of quantifiers defined by Shapiro [Shapiro, 1979] enables the representation of the predicate calculus within the mind of the cognitive agent, and therefore its full use for reasoning by that agent. Woods <ref> [Woods, 1975] </ref> stated that the forerunner of SNePS was unique (at the time) in its correct incorporation of the facilities of the predicate calculus. <p> The only way to add new information about a concept is with nodes that dominate it. In other words, the structural status of a node cannot be changed; new information can only be added assertionally, a dichotomy used by Woods <ref> [Woods, 1975] </ref> and formalized for SNePS, as discussed in x2.5. 2.7.2 Articles of Faith There are also unwritten principles held, or at least proposed, by those who have devoted significant time and discussion to the study and development of SNePS|and which are not fully addressed in the published literature: 14 Full
