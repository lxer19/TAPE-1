Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with a discrete time, single server system in which packets arrive from a finite population of sources. Under the assumption that arrivals from each source are modulated by a Markov process, we consider the following metrics (i) the fraction of an interval that the queue length exceeds a certain value, and (ii) the fraction of a group of packets from a single source that arrive to find the queue length above a certain value. For both metrics we derive upper and lower bounds on the probabilities that they exceed a threshold. These are important measures because they reflect more accurately the behavior perceived by applications such as networked audio and video. An application of these results to call admission is also given.

We begin by establishing an upper bound. <p> Also included are approximations for the lower bounds on M im and M bm based on the effective bandwidth approach (cf. Propositions 3.1 and 4.1), where we let ~ = ln (1=22)=b for every fixed b 2 (0; 1000]. We observe, as in <ref> [10] </ref>, that the effective bandwidth approach is very conservative for small values of b (i.e. for b &lt; 100). 6 Summary In this paper, we have derived lower and upper bounds of an exponential form on two QoS metrics, the interval metric and the block metric.

We conclude this section by introducing some additional notation and by reviewing several results from <ref> [18] </ref> pertaining to the tail distribution of the backlog, P (Q n x). Define F k (x) = P (U n (k) &lt; x) for k 2 S and k () = E [exp (U n (k))] for k 2 S. <p> Denote by z () = (z k (); k 2 S) the unique right-eigenvector such that jz ()j = 1.

We will find it useful to use bounds on the backlog distribution conditioned on the state of the Markov chain. These are, see <ref> [18] </ref>, P (Q n &gt; x j Y n = k) C () (z k ()=(k)) e x (5) P (Q n &gt; x j Y n = k) B (z k ( fl )=(k)) e fl x (6) for all x 0, k 2 S, n = 1; 2; : <p> It has been shown elsewhere (e.g., <ref> [18] </ref>) that it is much easier to compute fl , C (), and B for the case of independent sources, than for the case of an arbitrary arrival process, even if the numbers of states in the underlying Markov chains are the same. <p> The effective bandwidth, c m () for source m is c m () = 4 where t m () = r m m () . We have the following result (Proposition 3.1 in <ref> [18] </ref>). Proposition 2.1 lim log P (Q &gt; x) if and only if M X c m () c: This carries the implication that admission control can consist of simply checking if there is sufficient excess bandwidth at a server to cover the effective bandwidth requirement of a new source. <p> This type of result has been shown in more generality (see <ref> [18] </ref>).
