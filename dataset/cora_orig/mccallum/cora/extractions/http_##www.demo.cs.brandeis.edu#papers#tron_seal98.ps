Abstract: Robustness has long been recognised as a critical issue for coevolutionary learning. It has been achieved in a number of cases, though usually in domains which involve some form of non-determinism. We examine a deterministic domain a pseudo real-time two-player game called Tron and evolve a neural network player using a simple hill-climbing algorithm. The results call into question the importance of determinism as a requirement for successful co-evolutionary learning, and provide a good opportunity to examine the relative importance of other factors.

Reference-contexts: We have found this to be a very useful tool for studying the effect of co-evolutionary learning in various task domains. Previously, we have applied this method successfully to backgammon [Pol-lack and Blair, 1998] as well as a simulated robotic hockey game called Shock <ref> [Blair and Sklar, 1998] </ref>. Tron is similar to these domains in some respects but differs in other, significant, aspects. Backgammon is a stochastic domain in which the outcome of each game is influenced by random dice rolls as well as choices made by the players.

Reference-contexts: As the game advanced, the arena filled with walls and eventually one opponent would die by crashing into a wall. This game became very popular and was subsequently implemented on many computers with varying rules, graphic interpretations and configurations. In earlier work <ref> [Funes et al., 1998] </ref>, we built an interactive version of Tron (using Java) and released it on the Internet. <p> They exhibit a consistent inter-line spacing of approximately 12 and 4 pixels, respectively.

Reference-contexts: In earlier work [Funes et al., 1998], we built an interactive version of Tron (using Java) and released it on the Internet. With this setup, we created a new type of co-evolutionary learning where one population consists of software agents controlled by evolving genetic programs (GP) <ref> [Koza, 1992] </ref> and the other population is comprised of human users. This experiment has been fascinating for many reasons and from various points of view.
