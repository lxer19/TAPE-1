Title: Scheduling Messages on Controller Area Network for Real-Time CIM Applications  
Author: Khawar M. Zuberi and Kang G. Shin 
Abstract: Scheduling messages on the Controller Area Network (CAN) corresponds to assigning identifiers (IDs) to messages according to their priorities. In this paper we present the mixed traffic scheduler (MTS), which provides higher schedulability than fixed-priority schemes like deadline-monotonic (DM) while incurring less overhead than dynamic earliest-deadline (ED) scheduling. Through simulations, we compare the performance of MTS with that of DM and ED* (an imaginary scheduler which works like ED, except it incurs less overhead). Our simulations show that MTS performs much better than DM and at the same level as ED*, except under high loads and tight deadlines, when ED* is superior.

Reference-contexts: Using the schedulability conditions of Section IV-C, we want to check schedulability of workloads under different scheduling policies when one workload parameter (such as the number of a certain type of message) is varied. To check schedula-bility under ED*, we use the schedulability check for non-preemptive ED in <ref> [15] </ref>. B.1 Varying number of high-speed periodics We varied the number of 6 kHz periodic messages. The results are shown in Figure 4. DM can handle only five 6 kHz messages (total utilization of 58.5%), whereas both ED* and MTS can handle up to 8 each (72.7% utilization).
