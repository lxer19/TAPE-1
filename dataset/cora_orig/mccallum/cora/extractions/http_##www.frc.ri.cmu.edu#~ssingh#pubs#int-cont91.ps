Title: Abstract  
Abstract: We propose a methodology to automatically generate robot actions for tasks that cannot be abstracted into a geometrical basis because of complex interaction between the robot and the world. Our method considers such a task, robotic excavation, by seeking to satisfy constraints posed by the robot and the world to generate plans that optimize an arbitrary cost function. We discuss the constraints, the optimizing scheme and preliminary simulation results.

Reference-contexts: While it is simple to implement, by itself, simulated annealing suffers from the problem that it might take an enormously large amount of time to converge to the optimum value <ref> [Bohachevsky] </ref>. We discuss the method in detail below. 4.1. Simulated Annealing Simulated annealing is best explained by a 2D example shown in figure 6. Let the unshaded area be the admissible area (that meets all constraints). M denotes the optimal point with respect to an objective function J.

Reference-contexts: Some researchers have used an operation space (o-space), an expanded space that includes essential control variables that uniquely specify task execution <ref> [Brost] </ref>. For example, in the squeeze grasping domain where the robot is trying to grasp an object, the position and orientation of the object forms the c-space, while the o-space additionally includes separate dimensions for control variables like pushing direction.

Reference-contexts: Soil Model A soil model is needed to verify digging strategies. To this end we have implemented a soil model in which the terrain is represented as 2D grid cells <ref> [Homma] </ref>. In Hommas model, the 2-D world is tessellated into cells which are occupied to denote the existence of soil at that particular location.

Reference-contexts: Inadmissable regions correspond to impossible configurations such as interpenetration of the robot and objects in the environment. The task of path planning is stated as finding a path between two points in c-space (denoting starting and final configurations) while avoiding the set of inadmissable configurations [Lozano-Perez] <ref> [Laumond] </ref> [Stentz] [Rimon]. Some researchers have used an operation space (o-space), an expanded space that includes essential control variables that uniquely specify task execution [Brost].

Reference-contexts: For the case of constrained optimization we will need to ensure that the search remains within the bounds of the constraints. This is typically accomplished by projecting the gradient on the constraint surface when the gradient points outside the constrained volume <ref> [Luenberger] </ref>. Alternatively, the objective function maybe modified to be artificially very low at the boundaries. Now the modified function is used with gradient descent. The problem with such approaches is that they are prone to local extrema in the objective function.
