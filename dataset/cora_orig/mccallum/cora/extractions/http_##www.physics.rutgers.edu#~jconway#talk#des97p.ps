Abstract: Recent Results of Searches for New Particles Abstract. The CDF Collaboration has searched for new particles in 109 pb 1 integrated luminosity of pp collisions at the Teva-tron. The lastest results are presented, including searches for leptoquarks, Higgs bosons, supersymmetric particles, and heavy in CDF

Reference-contexts: This run, called Run 1A, was followed in 1993-1995 by Run 1B, in which roughly 90 pb 1 were recorded, for a total Run 1 integrated luminosity of 110 pb 1 . This large sample of data led to the discovery of the top quark <ref> [1] </ref>, precision electroweak measurements, studies of b quark mesons, studies of quantum chromodynamics, and the search for new particles and phenomena beyond the standard model.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents recent results on this latter topic, including the search for leptoquarks, charged and neutral Higgs bosons, supersymmetric processes leading to final states with photon, and the search for stable ehavy charged particles. 1 E-mail: conway@physics.rutgers.edu 1 The CDF detector is described in detail elsewhere <ref> [2] </ref>. Searches for new particles make use of its full range of features, particularly its excellent electron and muon triggering and identification, missing transverse energy determination, b-jet tagging, and hadronic tau lepton decay identification. 2.

Reference-contexts: Leptoquarks The two HERA experiments H1 and ZEUS have observed an excess of events, in high energy collisions of electrons and protons, having large Q 2 and large x <ref> [3] </ref>. These events have an electron and a hadronic jet in the final state, and the invariant mass of the electron-jet system is near 200 GeV/c 2 .

Reference-contexts: This leaves three events, all at relatively low e-jet masses. 2 After all cuts one expects 62 events from background processes. of leptoquark mass, demanding that at each e-jet mass the events lie within 3 of that mass. The theoretical prediction of the leptoquark cross section <ref> [4] </ref> depends systematically on the choice of Q 2 scale; we consider the range from 0.5fi M ej to 2fi M ej .

Reference-contexts: The right-hand plot shows the region excluded if the cross section is 5.0 pb (the theoretical value <ref> [5] </ref>) or 7.5 pb. 4. Supersymmetry It was pointed out as early as 1985 [6] that in certain regions of the parameter space of supersymmetry, the dominant decay mode of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) to the lightest (LSP) might be via a loop diagram involving a final state photon.

Reference-contexts: If the standard model explanation for this event is not correct, various supersymmetric interpretations might account for it, but predict other observable consequences. For example, as pointed out by Ambrosianio et al. <ref> [8] </ref> the event could arise from selectron pair production, with the decay ~e ! eN 2 , with N 2 ! N 1 fl.
