Reference-contexts: In this respect, OO-Myriad adheres quite closely to the Dayal's approach of using aggregate functions as attribute derivation functions <ref> [1] </ref>. To carry the idea further, OO-Myriad allows the functions to be user-defined. Global Object Id In OO-Myriad, each global object has a unique identifier.

Reference-contexts: This achieves independence between the global schema structures and the local schema structures. 1 3.1 Deriving Global Classes In deriving the global classes, the three main issues to be dealt with are: entity identification <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, attribute value conflict resolution [4], and global oid generation. Entity identification is the process of identifying export objects that model the same real-world objects and hence to be merged.

Reference-contexts: This achieves independence between the global schema structures and the local schema structures. 1 3.1 Deriving Global Classes In deriving the global classes, the three main issues to be dealt with are: entity identification [2, 3], attribute value conflict resolution <ref> [4] </ref>, and global oid generation. Entity identification is the process of identifying export objects that model the same real-world objects and hence to be merged. Attribute value conflict resolution determines how the attributes of global objects can be derived from the attributes of their export objects.
