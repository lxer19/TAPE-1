Abstract: In economic interactions, negotiations are particu-lary important because they allow agents to improve their information about the environment and even to change their own characteristics. In each step of a negotiation an agent has to emit a message. This message conveys information about her preferences and endowments. Given that the information he uses to decide which message to emit comes from beliefs generated in previous stages of the negotiation, he has to cope with the uncertainity associated with them. The assesment of the states of the world also evolves during the negotiation. In this paper we analyze the intertwined dynamics of beliefs and decision, in order to determine conditions on the agents that allow them to reach agreements. The framework for decision making we consider here is based on defeasible evaluation of possibilities: an argument for a choice defeats another one if it is based on a computation that better uses all the available information.

Reference-contexts: Changes in the preferential orderings are allowed if they are motivated by reasons based on the increment of knowledge. Moreover, new alternatives can appear as a result of the acquisition of knowledge. Artificial Intelligence, for example, is also concerned with analogous problems (see <ref> (Dung 1995) </ref>,(Doyle 1990), (Kraus-Wilkenfeld-Zlotkin 1995), (Sandholm-Lesser 1997)). <p> Note that actually there does exist a double loop, also involving the belief formation process.

Their presentations are independent of the internal structure of arguments.

Reference-contexts: The arguments are compared and we say that a function that uses the input more efficiently defeats one that uses input less efficiently. This idea generalizes the defeat of arguments based on specificity <ref> (Loui 1987) </ref>(Simari-Loui 1992)(Vreeswijk 1991). Finally, an agent's choices are based on the outputs of her undefeated arguments We will show that there are two ways to lead a negotiation to an agreement. One way is to determine a protocol.

Reference-contexts: Their presentations are independent of the internal structure of arguments.

Reference-contexts: Our model, with adequate tailoring can be applied in different settings where negotiations play a crucial role. Since linguistic interactions are commonly avoided in economics, the usual line of attack to the same class of problems is different, being based in the idea of social choice <ref> (Sen 1986) </ref>. Individuals make a simultaneous declaration of their characteristics, which determines the social outcome. This outcome is represented as the output of a social choice function that receives as input the characteristics of the agents.

Reference-contexts: Note that there is no explicit integrative protocol for the negotiation and each agent has to conjecture its form. The following is a preliminary definition used to introduce the main result (see <ref> (Stokey et al. 1989) </ref>): Definition 11 A sequence of beliefs fB t i g 1 agent i is said to converge in rational expectations if 9B fl i !

Reference-contexts: For each subset L of M SG, W L is the set of messages in L with excess demands closer to equilibrium and V L is the set of messages in L such that their excess demands are farther away from equilibrium (see <ref> (Tohme 1996) </ref> for the precise definitions).
