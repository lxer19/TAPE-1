Abstract: Wormhole routing LANs are emerging as an effective solution for high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects in distributed computing and cluster computing applications. An important example is the 640 Mb/s crossbar-based Myri-net. A key property of conventional LANs, which is valuable for many distributed applications, is transparent, reliable network-level multicast. It is desirable to retain this property also in wormhole LANs. Unfortunately, efficient, reliable multicasting in wormhole LANs is problematic because of the potential for deadlocks. As a consequence, current multicasting implementations typically consist of repeated unicast or assume a priori buffer reservations. These solutions, however, tend to increase latency and do not scale well. In this paper we address the problem of providing transparent, reliable, efficient network level multicasting in the wormhole LAN. We describe several protocols for achieving deadlock-free, reliable multicasting using restricted routing and fast buffer reservation techniques. Tradeoffs involving complexity and performance of various solutions are discussed, and are illustrated using simulation. A simple multicast implementation for Myrinet has been carried out, and experimental results are presented.

Reference-contexts: Using the STOP/GO mechanism, the rest of the worm is stored in the slack buffers of upstream nodes. One drawback of backpressure is the possibility of cre-ating a cycle of blocked worms which result in deadlock <ref> [DS87, PGL96] </ref>. Upon detection of a deadlock, one or more worms could be dropped to break the cycle. However, in this paper, we focus on reliable networks in which loss of worms inside the network must be avoided. Hence, deadlock-free routing must be employed.

Reference-contexts: Reliable multicasting is straightforward in shared medium LANs. It can also be efficiently achieved in store-and-forward LANs such as ATM LANs and router based internets <ref> [FJM + 95] </ref>. Unfortunately, multicasting is much more challenging in wormhole networks because the simplicity of the crossbar switches makes it difficult to support multicast trees in the fabric. <p> In other words, the time taken to reserve the buffer may exceed by far the actual buffer usage time. Finally, the scheme is vulnerable to credit manager failure. Reliable multicasting can also be provided at the transport level (i.e., above switch and host interfaces) <ref> [FJM + 95] </ref>. For example, consider the case where the members of the multicast group are arranged in a chain, and the multicast source is at one end of the chain. The message is passed from one host to the next via wormhole routing. <p> If the worm becomes deadlocked and is dropped in the middle of the chain, half of the destinations do not receive it. Assuming multicast messages are sent in sequence, the gap in the sequence alerts some hosts of the loss. Using the request/repair scheme proposed in <ref> [FJM + 95] </ref> one of these hosts will time out first and send a retransmission request up the chain. The first host which gets the request and which received the original message will rebroadcast it downstream. <p> In fact, in some situations it may be more cost effective to relax altogether reliability in network level multicasting (i.e. in the switch or in the host interface) and enforce it at the transport level, using techniques such as the request/repair algorithm reported in <ref> [FJM + 95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Distributed supercomputing and cluster computing impose certain critical demands upon the network. These demands often include low-latency multicast service. Distributed algorithms which use multicasting normally require it to be reliable. Other multicast applications include Distributed Active Simulation <ref> [fST94] </ref> and the real-time MBone service. Ideally, the wormhole LAN performs as a very high-speed Ethernet, namely: low latency (the worm can be injected whenever the interface is free); guaranteed delivery (after the worm has been completely output to the network), and; low cost.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wormhole-routing networks [NM93] are finding increasing application as fast, low-latency interconnects, both for interhost communication over small areas, and intrahost communication for multiprocessor machines. The main characteristics of wormhole networks are wormhole routing <ref> [KK79] </ref>, use of backpressure for flow control, and in most cases source routing. The physical layer of these networks is generally reliable. Network sources can normally assume that if they send out a packet, or `worm', on the network then it will eventually be received at the destination.

The main characteristics of wormhole networks are wormhole routing [KK79], use of backpressure for flow control, and in most cases source routing. <p> Myrinet employs wormhole routing, backpressure flow control and source routing to achieve low-latency transfer of variable-sized messages called worms in the local area network environment. We now briefly describe the Myrinet protocols, to provide a background and reference for the sections to follow. Wormhole Routing. In wormhole routing <ref> [NM93] </ref>, the unit of information transfer is a worm. A worm can range in length from a few bytes to several thousand bytes. In Myrinet, the maximum worm size is 9 Kbytes (this is a limit imposed by the LANai's control program).

Reference-contexts: At the originating host, each multicast worm chooses a mul-ticast group uniformly from among the groups that it is a member of. 7.1 Simulation Results The Hamiltonian and rooted tree schemes have been compared for two topologies: the 8 fi 8 torus and the 24-node bidirectional shufflenet <ref> [PLG95] </ref>. The average multicast latency was used as a measure of network loading and performance. The average worm length was 400 bytes. Worm generation was by a Poisson process and the lengths were geometrically distributed.

Reference-contexts: However, in this paper, we focus on reliable networks in which loss of worms inside the network must be avoided. Hence, deadlock-free routing must be employed. We next describe the deadlock-free up/down routing approach that was first used by Autonet <ref> [SBB + 91] </ref> and now is employed by Myrinet. Up/Down Routing. In up/down routing, one of the nodes is chosen arbitrarily as the root of a tree and all links of the topology are designated as `up' or `down' links with respect to this root.

Reference-contexts: This solution is very reliable, but does not scale well: the source interface is tied up dur-ing the entire multicast session, leading to large latencies. Furthermore, total ordering cannot be enforced. Another solution, also based on host adapter multicast-ing is reported in <ref> [VLB96] </ref>. A buffer credit scheme which is the extension of the Illinois Fast Messages [PLC95] credit scheme is proposed. Multicast is performed on a precom-puted binary tree which spans all the multicast members. <p> A possible approach would be to let the originator of the multicast message carry out the reservations before sending the message. Basically, this is the solution implemented in the `credit' scheme proposed in <ref> [VLB96] </ref>. <p> This may force the originating host to split the message in smaller fragments and thus increase the overhead. A clever solution, which was reported in <ref> [VLB96] </ref>, is to use the host DMA buffer as an `extension' of the host adapter buffer. That is, multicast worms in transit through the adapter can temporarily `overflow' to the host DMA buffer and be retrieved later.
