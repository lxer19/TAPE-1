Abstract: Interdomain multicast routing is a challenge, requiring a scalable solution that is suitable for diverse application characteristics. Center-based routing trees overcome some of the limitations associated with traditional shortest-path tree routing, however they present a new set of routing problems. Specifically, the choice of the center router can be critical in determining the multicast routing performance. We present and assess algorithms to solve two problems: selection of an initial center router, and migration of the center router in response to dynamic changes in the group membership during the application lifetime. These two problems, and our proposed solutions, may have more general applicability in wide-area networking, e.g., in placing shared resources in the network or estimating bandwidth utilization for multicast distribution. Keywords: Multicast, Routing, Internetworking

Reference-contexts: Scenario SM (Seminar) This scenario mimics the membership characteristics of the UCB Multimedia Seminar session <ref> [1] </ref>. Table 1 gives the probability distributions that characterize each instance. Figure 3 shows how the number and 2 Scenarios are named for representative applications believed to exhibit the given characteristics; this is clearly debatable.

Reference-contexts: In this section we introduce Random Participant Evaluation, which works in the same manner as above except that it utilizes probabilistic multicast <ref> [2] </ref> to control the number of responses sent by participants to each candidate center. In probabilistic multicast, a packet is multicast to all receivers. The header of this multicast packet contains an acceptance probability, ff, which each participant uses to determine whether or not to respond.

Reference-contexts: We adapt the receiver congestion discovery protocol proposed by Bolot <ref> [4] </ref> to determine the number of receivers.

If the current center decides to perform center migration, this occurs using a center change protocol, such as in PIM <ref> [7] </ref>. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method by inspecting the ratio of our estimated multicast bandwidth to the actual multicast bandwidth over randomly generated instances using the transit-stub graphs.

Reference-contexts: As we will see, the performance gain can be significant with a well-chosen center. Selecting a center becomes more difficult if the make-up of the group changes during the lifetime of the connection. As an example application, consider the multicast requirements of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) <ref> [11] </ref> or distributed game-playing: each entity must multicast information about its location and activity to the other entities within its current region-of-influence. The region-of-influence can change radically during the simulation, as entities move about within the virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: A node which knows it is a transit node can use the 1.25 factor to more accurately estimate bandwidth based on computation using average node degree. Note that this factor is graph model specific. We note that Thaler and Ravishankar <ref> [13] </ref> also give a method to estimate bandwidth from information on distances to receivers.

Reference-contexts: Note that work by Wei and Estrin <ref> [16] </ref> reports ratios of center-based to shortest-path based protocols which are much smaller, but this is for optimal centers. While the bandwidth approaches the shortest-path routing bandwidth, the variance is quite high for some scenarios. <p> nodes are neither centers nor receiver/sources indicating the capability for further improvement. 5 Traffic Concentration One of the purported drawbacks of center-based trees is their tendency to concentrate traffic on certain links of the network, due to the sharing of the center-based routing tree by all sources in a group <ref> [7, 16] </ref>. We demonstrate that traffic concentration is not inherent in the center-based tree approach; rather it is sensitive to center choice and can be significantly reduced (if desired) by choosing centers at random. To measure traffic concentration, we model a large number of connections in the same network. <p> There are 50 links which carry no traffic whatsoever and are not included on this plot. These results are qualitatively similar to the traffic concentration reported by other authors <ref> [16] </ref>. To demonstrate that traffic concentration is influenced (and can be alleviated) by center choice, we also compute the link load when the center for each group is chosen at random from all nodes in the graph. The right plot in Figure 9 shows this result.
