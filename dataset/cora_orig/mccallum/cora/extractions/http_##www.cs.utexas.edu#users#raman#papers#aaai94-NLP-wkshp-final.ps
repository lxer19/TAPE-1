Abstract: We describe a tool, the Figure Understander, which has been developed for integrating text and graphically-drawn diagrammatic input to a problem solving system. Graphical editors not only provide a geometric description which easily identifies the objects in a scene, but also provide other features, such as colors and filling patterns, for distinguishing objects. We use these features to provide limited semantic information about objects directly in the diagram. We show that this greatly simplifies the solution to the coreference problem.

Reference-contexts: The previous work in the area of integrating text and pictoral information [Novak and Bulko 90, Srihari 91] has assumed that the pictures were provided in visual (raster) form. Under such circumstances, visual scene analysis <ref> [Ballard and Brown 82] </ref> is required to identify the diagram objects of interest, and domain libraries covering the expected contents of diagrams have to be employed to determine the conceptual purpose of the diagram objects. <p> In their work, diagram input is treated as simulated visual input, consisting of interconnected lines, arcs, and points. They demonstrated effective results on several non-trivial examples, but their approach requires addressing ambiguities in the interpretation of the diagram. They suffer from the classic visual scene analysis problem <ref> [Ballard and Brown 82] </ref> of deciding which line segments belong together as parts of the same object, and which are only accidentally intersecting.

Reference-contexts: Its output is a fragment of a knowledge base which contains an integrated description of the information in each form of input. In the current implementation, the Algernon knowledge representation language <ref> [Crawford and Kuipers 91] </ref> is used to maintain the knowledge base. The Figure Under-stander makes use of a spatial reasoning module, a domain model, and a picture description model, as described further below, to process the text and diagram input.

Reference-contexts: The unique roles of diagrams and text has already been analyzed in great detail by such authors as Larkin and Simon [1987]. To integrate the information in text and diagrams, one must solve the problem of establishing coreference <ref> [Novak and Bulko 90, 93] </ref> matching object references in the text against objects in the diagram. We are developing a problem solver for the magnetic fields domain which uses qualitative spatial and dynamic reasoning to solve the problems [Rajagopalan 94]. <p> The diagram describes the spatial state and the text describes the dynamic changes that are taking place. The parenthesized words are unnecessary since we specify semantic information directly in the diagram. that we also had to address the research issues associated with integrating multi-modal input <ref> [Novak and Bulko 90, Srihari 91] </ref>. Whether we chose to provide the information missing in the diagram through text or direct knowledge base assertions, we still needed a means of associating object references in the second form of input with the appropriate diagram objects. <p> The Figure Under-stander makes use of a spatial reasoning module, a domain model, and a picture description model, as described further below, to process the text and diagram input. The previous work in the area of integrating text and pictoral information <ref> [Novak and Bulko 90, Srihari 91] </ref> has assumed that the pictures were provided in visual (raster) form.

Reference-contexts: We have previously described the application of the Figure Understander as the input processing module for our magnetic fields problem solver <ref> [Rajagopalan and Kuipers 94] </ref>. In that application, the number of objects in the scene was small, each diagram object represented a conceptual object, and there was only one diagram object of each conceptual class in a given problem. <p> The input also includes a list of the sentences to be processed, and the picture semantics form to the used. As Figure Understander processes the diagram, it creates knowledge base objects for all the diagram objects <ref> [Rajagopalan and Kuipers 94] </ref>, and stores both the spatial information about the objects and the semantic information given through the picture semantics.

PICTION <ref> [Srihari 91] </ref> is another example of a system for coordinating text and pictoral input given in visual form. Our work complements the previously developed methods by considering the problem of integrating text and graphically-drawn diagrams. This medium has the advantage that a geometric representation of the objects is provided.
