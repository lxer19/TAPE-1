Reference-contexts: We say that the action a has the cocycle property if there exists a Borel cocycle ff such that a (x; ff (x; y)) = y. For all undefined notions and basic facts concerning Polish group actions, we refer the reader to <ref> [BK] </ref>. - 3 - (II) Polish spaces and Model theory. We now describe how to represent the class of countably infinite structures of a given first order language by the elements of a Polish space. For convenience, we shall work only with relational first order languagues.

Reference-contexts: By a result of Feldman and Moore <ref> [FM] </ref>, every such equivalence relation is of the form E a for a Borel action a of a countable group G on X. A countable Borel equivalence relation E is called universal if F B E for any other countable Borel equivalence relation F .

Reference-contexts: We can now rephrase several known interpretability results in this language. For example, the theory of graphs is Borel complete. Mekler [Me] showed that the class of nilpotent class 2 groups of exponent p is Borel complete. Fried and Kollar <ref> [FK] </ref> proved the same result for the class of fields of any characteristic 6= 2 and Prohle provided a proof for = 2. This result was rediscovered in [FS], where the authors also show that the theory of linear orderings is Borel complete.

Reference-contexts: For those classes consisting of the countable models of some L ! 1 ;! -sentence, Friedman and Stanley <ref> [FS] </ref> proposed to use the methods of descriptive set theory to study their possible invariants and defined the notion of Borel reducibility between such classes of structures.

Reference-contexts: For those classes consisting of the countable models of some L ! 1 ;! -sentence, Friedman and Stanley [FS] proposed to use the methods of descriptive set theory to study their possible invariants and defined the notion of Borel reducibility between such classes of structures. In <ref> [HK] </ref>, Hjorth and Kechris continued this study and situated it within the general theory of Borel equivalence relations. This provides tools for the analysis of the isomorphism relation and a framework for measuring the complexity of possible invariants. <p> Recall that an equivalence relation E is said to be countable if each equivalence class of E is countable. Given a theory , we say that ~ = is essentially countable iff ~ = B E for some countable Borel equivalence relation E on a Borel set X. In <ref> [HK] </ref>, - 2 - Hjorth and Kechris show that the following are equivalent: (i) ~ = is essentially countable; (ii) there is a countable fragment F L ! 1 ;! containing such that if M = hN; i is a model of , there exists a 2 N &lt;! such that <p> Thus if we show that ~ = is a universal essentially countable Borel equivalence relation, then we know that any kind of invariants used to classify models of ~ = must necessarily be rather complex. For a more detailed discussion and many other examples, we refer the reader to <ref> [HK] </ref>. The main result of this paper is that the isomorphism relation for finitely generated groups (in fact, 5-generated groups) is a universal essentially countable Borel equivalence relation. This proves Conjecture 5.8 from [HK]. <p> For a more detailed discussion and many other examples, we refer the reader to <ref> [HK] </ref>. The main result of this paper is that the isomorphism relation for finitely generated groups (in fact, 5-generated groups) is a universal essentially countable Borel equivalence relation. This proves Conjecture 5.8 from [HK]. The same proof shows that this theory does not admit canonical models. (We shall define this notion in x3.) We shall also study the conjugacy relation on subgroups of F 2 and show that it is also universal. <p> ;! is said to admit canonical models if there exists a "Borel definable" function S which to each countable model M of assigns a countable model S (M) of such that M ~ = N implies S (M) = S (N ) ~ = M: (For an exact definition, see <ref> [HK, Section 7] </ref>.) A sentence 2 L ! 1 ;! is concretely classifiable if S can be chosen so that S (M) has universe N for each countable model S (M) of . <p> In - 13 - <ref> [HK] </ref>, Hjorth and Kechris showed that many interesting sentences admit canonical models but are not concretely classifiable, including the theories of rank 1 abelian torsion-free groups and of rigid locally finite graphs; and they also proved that the theory of locally finite trees does not admit canonical models. <p> In the remainder of this section, we shall prove that the theory of finitely generated groups does not admit canonical models. We shall make use of the following results of Hjorth and Kechris <ref> [HK] </ref>. Theorem 4 If 2 L ! 1 ;! , then the following are equivalent. (i) admits canonical models. (ii) The logic action of S 1 on Mod () has the cocycle property.

Notice that F also acts naturally on F by translations. Thus Hol (F ) also acts on F ~ = Z Z as the group of affine transformations (Z Z) o GL (2; Z).

Let (F; ) be the permutation group such that = F , and F acts on via the right regular representation. <p> Let fx n : n 2 Ng be a set of free generators of [F; F ] and let G = hx 0 ; x 1 i. Claim 1 N F (G) = G. PROOF: Let N = N F (G). By <ref> [MKS, Exercise 2.4.5] </ref>, whenever H is a finitely generated subgroup of a free group, then H has finite index in its normalizer. In particular, [N : G] &lt; 1. Clearly N " [F; F ] = G. <p> So suppose that ' : G S ! G T is an isomorphism for some S; T 2 P fl (F ). Let u = z ' . Then u has order 5. By <ref> [MKS, Corollary 4.4.5] </ref>, u is contained in a conjugate of either H T or D T . Hence, by adjusting ' by an inner automorphism of G T , we can suppose that z ' 2 hzi. <p> Applying Lemma 6, we now find that D S = C G S (hzi) ' = C G T (hzi) = D T : Notice that D S = (V hzi) fl V S hzi (B S hzi): Hence, by <ref> [MKS, Corollary 4.5] </ref>, Z (D S ) = V S hzi. It follows that (V S hzi) ' = V T hzi; and hence V ' S = V T . Choose any element v 2 V n V S . <p> Claim 3 V ' = V PROOF: Choose any x 2 V n V S . Then: (a) neither x ' nor v ' is contained in a conjugate of V T hzi; (b) v ' 2 V hzi; By <ref> [MKS, Theorem 4.5] </ref>, x ' 2 V hzi and so x ' 2 V . Thus V ' V .

Reference-contexts: If G is countable, then Sg (G) is a closed subset of P (G) with the product topology and thus is a Polish space. Let (G; Sg (G)) denote the conjugacy action of G on Sg (G).

The main theorem of this section is the following strengthening of their result.
