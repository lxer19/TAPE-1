Title: Project Zeus: Design of a Broadband Network and its Application on a University Campus  
Author: Jerome R. Cox, Jr. and Jonathan S. Turner wucs--

Abstract: This proposal outlines a plan for the design, deployment and operation of a high speed campus network at Washington University based on fast packet switching technology that has been developed here during the last several years. This new network will support ubiquitous multimedia workstations with high-resolution graphics and video capabilities, opening up a wide range of new applications in research and education. It will support aggregate throughputs of hundreds of gigabits per second and will be designed to support port interfaces at up to 2.4 Gb/s. Initial implementations will emphasize 155 Mb/s port rates, with higher rates introduced as the demand arises and as economics permits. We propose to move this technology quickly into an operational setting where the objectives of network use and network research can be pursued concurrently.

Reference-contexts: The receive circuit in the port processors at the user-network interface include Access Resource Management circuitry to 24 Project Zeus monitor the peak and average bandwidth consumed by each active virtual circuit. More details on the resource management mechanisms are given in reference <ref> [43] </ref>. 4.3.2. Application Interfaces. We plan to implement a rich set of application interfaces in the phase 1 network, allowing for a wide range of user applications. First, the phase 0 broadband terminal will be upgraded to support the higher link speeds of the phase 1 network. <p> The call acceptance decision ensures that the probability is small that the short term load on any given link queue exceeds the link's capacity. The details of our approach are given in <ref> [43] </ref>. While we are confident that the chosen approach is a sound one, many specific questions concerning its performance can only be answered in the context of an operational network. Atm networks are intended to serve a wide class of traffic with varying traffic characteristics. <p> We expect the actual performance to be much better than the estimated upper bound of about one millisecond cited in <ref> [43] </ref>, but are interested in verifying this under actual operational conditions. We are interested in determining if there are any effective "shortcuts" to the general algorithm that can be used to cut the decision time down significantly and we want to verify our worst-case assumptions.
