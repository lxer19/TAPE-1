Abstract: The rate control mechanism for Available-Bit-Rate (ABR) traffic as defined by the ATM Forum does not distinguish between different types of ABR connections. However, since ABR traffic may result from a heterogeneous set of applications, there is an apparent need for a flow control scheme that can distinguish between and give differential treatment to different classes of ABR connections. In this study, a multi-level flow control scheme for ABR traffic is proposed that performs flow control of ABR traffic simultaneously at three levels: At the first level, the scheme determines the total available ABR bandwidth at a link. At the second level, the ABR bandwidth is distributed to different ABR traffic classes. At the third level, the scheme determines the bandwidth available to connections in same traffic class. It is shown that the multi-level flow control method completely decouples the explicit rate calculation of distinct traffic classes while achieving a high network utilization. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the multi-level flow control quickly adapts to load changes in the network.

Reference-contexts: Class-level flow control attempts to distribute unused bandwidth to traffic classes with a high bandwidth demand. * Connection-Level Flow Control distributes the bandwidth that is available to a specific traffic class among all connections from this class. Connection-level flow control implements the max-min fairness or bottleneck flow control <ref> [2, 7, 10] </ref> scheme, specified in the ATM Traffic Management Specification of the ATM Forum [21]. It allocates an equal amount of bandwidth to all ABR connections that are bottlenecked at the same link. However, different from [21], our connection-level flow control implements max-min fairness independently for each traffic class. <p> An algorithm executed by sources and switches for computing the explicit rate so as to satisfy the fairness criteria. Within the ATM community, the most popular policy for setting the explicit rate is max-min fairness <ref> [2, 7, 10] </ref>. This policy gives each ABR connection the same maximum throughput allocation, so-called share, on each link in the network. <p> By enforcing that shares of all overloaded class-p connections at a link are identical, we implement an intuitive notion of fairness, in the sense that all connections that have the same bottleneck link have identical throughput constraints <ref> [2, 7, 10, 24] </ref>. Therefore, we will refer to the shares as fair share. Given an assignment of share values on each link, the ABR connections for class-p on a link l are labeled as overloaded or restricted at link k. <p> In this case, the connection-level flow control scheme is identical to max-min fair flow control <ref> [2] </ref>. Note that fair shares need to be defined only for links with at least one overloaded connection. If such a connection exists, i.e., O lp 6= ;, then the entire available bandwidth can be allocated to the ABR connections.

Reference-contexts: After considering a number of different flow control approaches for ABR traffic [14, 15, 17, 18, 23], the ATM Forum settled on a closed-loop rate-based scheme for ABR traffic with a control loop as shown in Figure 1 <ref> [8] </ref>. An ABR source periodically sends Resource Management (RM) cells to the destination, which in turn sends the RM cells back to the source. On its roundtrip through the network, the RM cells collect congestion information which is given to the sources as feedback.
