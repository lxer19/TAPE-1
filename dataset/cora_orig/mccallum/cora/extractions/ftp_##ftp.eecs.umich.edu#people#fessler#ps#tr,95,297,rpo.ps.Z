Reference-contexts: For systems where the geometric response can be factored into product of discretized Radon transform with a space-invariant blur, one can further simplify the calculation above. One useful approximation to the kernel of G 0 G is f (r) = 2r; r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 (arcsin (1=r) (r p ; which is shown in Figure 2 of [21] (cf [?, Fig. 11] and [?, Fig. 1]). This function has the expected 1=r asymptotic form, but is well behaved near zero|as it must be for a discrete system.

Reference-contexts: Resolution/noise tradeoff of FBP with Hamming window and the constrained least-squares (CLS) window (45). At any given resolution, the variances of the penalized-likelihood estimates are smaller than those of FBP. have shown qualitatively in <ref> [21] </ref> that nonuniform weighting is essential to achieve the desirable noise properties of statistical methods. In Section X, we provide additional analyses and quantitative results that demonstrate the importance of weighting. <p> This section derives such approximations and demonstrates that they are usefully accurate. The expressions give further insight into why weighted statistical methods outperform unweighted statistical methods for image reconstruction, as illustrated qualitatively in <ref> [21] </ref>. 16 In this section we focus on quadratic penalties, although one can extend the analysis to nonquadratic penalties. <p> Thus q Varf ^ UPLS j g (fi)! j : (61) For the 100 realizations described in Section VI, we computed ^ UPLS using the iterative algorithm described in <ref> [21] </ref>, including the nonnegativity constraint. Fig. 24 shows the empirical sample standard deviations map of those estimates, as well as the approximation (61). Fig. 25 shows profiles through those maps, and again demonstrates the accuracy of the variance approximation (61). <p> The variances of the PL estimates are significantly lower than those of the UPLS estimates. This result, though approximate, adds further evidence to the importance of using weighting for heteroscedastic measurements, either explicitly as in penalized weighted least-squares estimators <ref> [21, 52] </ref>, or implicitly by using penalized-likelihood estimators. <p> One useful approximation to the kernel of G 0 G is f (r) = 2r; r 2 [0; 1] 2 (arcsin (1=r) (r p ; which is shown in Figure 2 of <ref> [21] </ref> (cf [?, Fig. 11] and [?, Fig. 1]).

Reference-contexts: However, the above analysis is useful for understanding and quantifying basic resolution properties. It is also useful for designing preconditioners for fast gradient-based iterative methods <ref> [?, 22] </ref>. C. A FWHM Rule of Thumb It is well known that the FWHM of bump-shaped point spread functions is approximately equal to 1=(2 h ), where h is the half-amplitude frequency, i.e. L 0 ( h ) = 1 2 L 0 (0).

Reference-contexts: Just What You Expected Fig. 6 shows the tradeoff between resolution (measured by the average FWHM of the local impulse response) and noise (measured by the empirical standard deviation) as fi is varied. Fig. 6 also shows predicted standard deviations computing using the variance approximations described in <ref> [37] </ref>. (The good agreement between empirical and predicted results in Fig. 6 is further confirmation of the utility of the approximations in [37].) In Fig. 6, the resolution/noise data points follow an essentially identical tradeoff curve for both the standard and the modified penalty. <p> Fig. 6 also shows predicted standard deviations computing using the variance approximations described in <ref> [37] </ref>.

In Fig. 6, the resolution/noise data points follow an essentially identical tradeoff curve for both the standard and the modified penalty. <p> Note that for quadratic penalties, the matrix M fi is independent of the object , so one could precompute M fi or key portions of M fi (such as the central few diagonals) using algorithms similar to those discussed in <ref> [37] </ref>. For nearly space-invariant tomographs, the diagonal of M fi is approximately constant, so one can easily compute diagonal elements from (53) using Fourier methods. The approximations that follow below stem from the following approximation for the covariance of penalized likelihood estimates ^ PL in emission tomography [37]: Covf ^ PL <p> those discussed in <ref> [37] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is a nearly affine relationship between the FWHM of l 1 (r) and fi 1=3 0 for fi 0 &gt; 5, which may be used to simplify further the table lookup method for relating fi to FWHM described in Section V-E. X. Variance Approximations COMPARE WITH (45) of <ref> [41] </ref>. The approximation (36) provides an opportunity to derive simple approximate expressions for the variance of penalized-likelihood and unweighted penalized least-squares estimators. This section derives such approximations and demonstrates that they are usefully accurate.

Reference-contexts: Again this property is undesirable, particularly since mismatch between the spatial resolution of attenuation maps and emission measurements can cause image artifacts in PET <ref> [42] </ref>. With our modified penalty, the resolution is nearly uniform. Furthermore, if one uses the same geometric model G for both emission and transmission reconstruction 13 , then one can use the same parameter fi for both cases, encouraging consistency between emission and transmission spatial resolution.

Reference-contexts: C. Unweighted Penalized Least Squares FBP is an example of an unweighted estimator: all mea surements are treated equally. As noted in <ref> [51] </ref>, FBP (with a ramp filter) is closely related to an unweighted least-squares estimate, in the special case when the sys tem matrix is the Radon transform (i.e. no blur).
