Reference-contexts: (A BK) + fl 2 P BB 0 P + C 0 C = 0: (5) Proof: This is standard, see [11]. 2 It has been found to be possible to bound above the incremental gain using the solution of a coupled pair of linear matrix inequalities (see the text <ref> [1] </ref> for an exposition on linear matrix inequalities). This has been developed in [8], and will be stated in an appendix as an aid to readers. The two inequalities amount to being the simultaneous solution of the open loop Lyapunov equation, and the closed loop Riccati equation. <p> The first step is to realise that we can express the function 0 as 0 (x) = 2 with (x) given by: (x) := 1 sign (x) 1 2 x jxj &gt; 1: The importance of this is that 1 2 x is the centre of the sector <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and has the minimal norm to cover the sector. Now examine Figure 2. For ease of notation, let the linear operator with transfer function 1 s+a be denoted as G, and let H = G I+ 1 2 G . <p> In that paper, they prove the following Proposition. Proposition 4.1: Consider the system operator generated by: _x 1 (t) = x 2 ; x (0) = 0; with a; b &gt; 0. Then the mapping w 7! x is not L p+ stable for all p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Proof: This requires a fairly detailed analysis of test signals, and is done in [2, Section 8]. 2 As pointed out in [2], the system in the proposition is globally state space stable. <p> The function ~ 2 is the solution to the corresponding (discrete) algebraic Riccati equation, and so for test values of the Hamiltonian which correspond to differences between two points lying in <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the test holds with a test value of 1. If we examine some ~ such that j~j 1, but jf (~; !)j &gt; 1, we first note that for all values of ! in the test interval, f (~; !) = !. <p> If we write ! = ~ + , we have that: H (~; !) = ~ + (~ + + 1)(2~ + + 1) 6 2 (~ + ) 2 + ~ 2 ; 1 The maximising choice of over the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is = 1, and then we see that H (~; !) = 2j~j 1: If one verifies the algebra without setting fl = p 2, one will see that the choice of fl = p the minimal one such that the leading coefficient in the H (~; !) expression

Reference-contexts: The problem with characterising the induced norm in terms of dissipation functions is the computation of the functions themselves. There are generic existence theorems available, which rely on viscosity solution theory (see the paper by James <ref> [3] </ref>). The dissipation functions used herein were computed via the use of a (sub-optimal) heuristic algorithm developed in [7].

Reference-contexts: introduction of bounded input sets causes the induced norm to behave in a much more sensible fashion. It is believed that the use of such sets is necessary to give non-conservative analysis. This has been noted by other researchers, as in the paper by Lin, Saberi and Teel <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The behaviour of the bound is now sensible, as although there is a value of a at which it becomes unbounded, the failure occurs in a continuous fashion. 15 16 4 The Double Integrator We will now briefly comment on a result given the paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [5] </ref>.

(The response is given by: x (t) = &gt; &lt; t 0 t T; e t+2T 1 t 2T 1:) In this case, we are able to compare this norm bound with that given in the paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [6] </ref>. The bound given by their analysis is that kk i;2 2 (1+1) k L k 1 = 4. The analysis in [6] holds of course for general nonlinearities, and so it is not surprising that some deterioration would occur in the bound. 3.4 Case a &lt; 0, k = 1 <p> e t+2T 1 t 2T 1:) In this case, we are able to compare this norm bound with that given in the paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [6] </ref>.

The analysis in [6] holds of course for general nonlinearities, and so it is not surprising that some deterioration would occur in the bound. 3.4 Case a &lt; 0, k = 1 When the plant is open loop unstable, all signal bounds become undefined, at least over unbounded sets.

Reference-contexts: This has been noted by other researchers, as in the paper by Lin, Saberi and Teel [4]. Analysis techniques developed in [8] are used to compute the induced ` 2+ norm of a first order discrete time example. Many of the results on continuous time induced norm computation in <ref> [7] </ref> have been extended to discrete time, but it is not possible to give the results in as clean a form. Finally, a preliminary examination of the state feedback synthesis problem has been made. Two differing approaches to state feedback synthesis are illustrated for a first order example. <p> kK (~) + a (~)k + ~ 0 C 0 C~; dV fi fi fi (A~ + Bsign ( a (~))) fl 2 kK (~) + sign ( a (~))k 2 The function B (~) is defined: B (~) := 2 dx fi fi ~ Proof: This is taken from <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Remark 2.12: There has been a minor re-definition of B to take advantage of the simpler form of the system given here than that appears in [7], the equivalence of the test condition given here to that in [7] follows from the observations in [7, Remark 3.3]. <p> a (~))k 2 The function B (~) is defined: B (~) := 2 dx fi fi ~ Proof: This is taken from <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Remark 2.12: There has been a minor re-definition of B to take advantage of the simpler form of the system given here than that appears in [7], the equivalence of the test condition given here to that in [7] follows from the observations in [7, Remark 3.3]. The problem with characterising the induced norm in terms of dissipation functions is the computation of the functions themselves. <p> 2 dx fi fi ~ Proof: This is taken from <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Remark 2.12: There has been a minor re-definition of B to take advantage of the simpler form of the system given here than that appears in [7], the equivalence of the test condition given here to that in [7] follows from the observations in [7, Remark 3.3].

Preliminary definitions required will now be stated. 5 We assume that K (x) is linear, denoted K (x) = Kx. <p> Proof: In <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 3 The First Order Continuous Time Plant We will now apply the analysis techniques surveyed in Section 2 to the simplest possible non-trivial case, being the general first order plant with proportional feedback. <p> The A:1 equation corresponds directly to the algebraic Riccati equation, and the B expression to the algebraic Lyapunov equation. Their simultaneous solution corresponds to the continuous incremental gain inequalities. Reflection upon this example gives the reasons why the more detailed analysis undertaken in <ref> [7] </ref> is necessary to give less conservative results. Approaches which rely on quadratic properties will correspond to the A:1 expression, and neglect the fact that we can use the less strict A:2 expression if a is larger than 1, which is extremely likely to occur in the large. <p> will see that the choice of fl = p the minimal one such that the leading coefficient in the H (~; !) expression is non-positive. 6 A First Order State Feedback Synthesis We will now examine a simple application which illustrates the potential power of the analysis technique developed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The first order integrator with input saturation will once again be examined, but we will now synthesize a general nonlinear (state) feedback, using two different approaches. The first technique uses partial differential inequalities, following the sort of technique developed by A.J. van der Schaft in [9]. <p> The additional nonlinear terms may complicate linear system analysis, and lead to too complex controllers. One of the important inplication of the analysis in <ref> [7] </ref> is that linear controllers will preserve their norm properties over a non-negligible region around the origin. As the nonlinear analytic techniques and design intuition are nowhere near as developed as that for linear control theory, the preference is that the nonlinear techniques do not affect linear design processes unnecessarily.

Many of the results on continuous time induced norm computation in [7] have been extended to discrete time, but it is not possible to give the results in as clean a form. <p> In other words, this is viewed to be a preliminary attempt of using nonlinear H 1 methods to synthesize anti-windup schemes. 1 2 Mathematical Preliminaries We will now provide the background notation and theory used in this paper. The dissertation <ref> [8] </ref> contains a fulller development of this problem framework and these surveyed results. The problems studied herein are the gain computations for a class of nonlinear operators. <p> This has been developed in <ref> [8] </ref>, and will be stated in an appendix as an aid to readers. The two inequalities amount to being the simultaneous solution of the open loop Lyapunov equation, and the closed loop Riccati equation. <p> Originally in <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 It is conjectured that the "if" statement in Theorem 2.6 may be strengthened to "if and only if", but this is still an open problem. <p> Proof: This preliminary result is taken from <ref> [8, Theorem 3.6.11] </ref>. Theorem 2.11: Fix the operator : w 7! z. Assume that is L 2 -detectable, and that for w 2 W 2;q (N ), the reachable set lies within 0 R n . <p> It is possible to construct signal pairs which have much smaller infinity norms which display unbounded incremental gain behaviour. The following construction is a continuous time generalisation of the generic construction developed for discrete time systems in <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> The result is that the norm bound will deteriorate as the set size increases in an unbounded fashion. This dependence upon the set size may be of extreme importance for numerical computations. 5 Discrete Time Case The induced norm computation problem for discrete time systems was examined in <ref> [8] </ref>, but the results were less satisfactory than in the continuous time case. The inability to assume a quadratic form for the dissipation function makes the straight extension of the discrete time completion of squares impossible. The following test theorem on dissipation functions will now be stated without proof. <p> Proof: This is a simplification of <ref> [8, Theorem 6.4.1] </ref>. 2 We will now give an example of the use of Theorem 5.1 for a simple discrete time system. <p> The dissipation function to be used is: V (~) = ~ 2 j~j 1; 6 j~j &gt; 1 (this was generated by the dicrete time version of Theorem 2.14 <ref> [8, Theorem 6.5.6] </ref>). The function ~ 2 is the solution to the corresponding (discrete) algebraic Riccati equation, and so for test values of the Hamiltonian which correspond to differences between two points lying in [1; 1], the test holds with a test value of 1. <p> Additionally, in <ref> [8] </ref>, discrete time constructions have been made to show that if either the open or closed loop dynamics matrices are unstable, the incremental gain does not exist. These constructions use signals of small infinity norm, so bounding signal sizes appears to be unhelpful, unlike the induced norm problem. <p> These constructions use signals of small infinity norm, so bounding signal sizes appears to be unhelpful, unlike the induced norm problem. The result will be now stated without proof. (There is a further test condition for the non-existence of the incremental gain in <ref> [8] </ref>, but the result will not be stated due to its added notational complexity, and the fact that the result is somewhat less satisfactory in that there is no a priori characterisation of the size of the "destabilising" (incremental gain sense) test signal pairs.) See also the paper by Chitour, Liu <p> Additionally, the test signals constructed to show that the incremental gain is unbounded have an ` 1+ norm of 1 + *, for any * &gt; 0. Proof: See <ref> [8] </ref>. 2

Reference-contexts: Finally, a preliminary examination of the state feedback synthesis problem has been made. Two differing approaches to state feedback synthesis are illustrated for a first order example. The first method is an extension of that which appears in the paper <ref> [9] </ref> by A.J. van der Schaft, and which relies on the use of differential inequalities. Even the first order example shows some difficulties with a naive extension of the methods in [9] to this class of systems. <p> The first method is an extension of that which appears in the paper <ref> [9] </ref> by A.J. van der Schaft, and which relies on the use of differential inequalities. Even the first order example shows some difficulties with a naive extension of the methods in [9] to this class of systems. The second method relies on a parameterised piecewise linear controller, and the analysis undertaken to fix suitable parameter values. <p> The first order integrator with input saturation will once again be examined, but we will now synthesize a general nonlinear (state) feedback, using two different approaches. The first technique uses partial differential inequalities, following the sort of technique developed by A.J. van der Schaft in <ref> [9] </ref>. The second technique is similar in principle to the most basic anti-windup schemes, as the controller is fixed to be piecewise linear, and then algebraic conditions solved to fix the value of free parameters. <p> We take the plant to be controlled as: _x (t) = 0 (K (x (t)) + w (t)); 6.1 Controller Synthesis Using Partial Differential Inequalities The analysis here follows closely that given in <ref> [9] </ref>, and is of a preliminary nature. It may be possible to solve the state feedback problem using dynamic programming methods, however the preference is once again is to see whether more class specific algorithms may be developed. <p> An interesting issue arises as a consequence of the behaviour of a with fl = 1. The synthesis does not take advantage of the fact that the A:2 (~) A:1 (~), and hence is a weaker condition. It that if we are extend the methods in <ref> [9] </ref>, this issue will have to be seriously examined if the controller performance is to be satisfactory. 6.2 Synthesis of a Piecewise Linear Controller The control synthesised by the straight use of partial differential inequalities may be unsat isfactory, however.
