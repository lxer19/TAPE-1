Abstract: If analogy and case-based reasoning systems are to scale up to very large case bases, it is important to analyze the various methods used for retrieving analogues to identify the features of the problem for which they are appropriate. This paper reports on one such analysis, a comparison of retrieval by marker passing or spreading activation in a semantic network with Knowledge-Directed Spreading Activation, a method developed to be well-suited for retrieving semantically distant analogues from a large knowledge base. The analysis has two complementary components: (1) a theoretical model of the retrieval time based on a number of problem characteristics, and (2) experiments showing how the retrieval time of the approaches varies with the knowledge base size. These two components, taken together, suggest that KDSA is more likely than SA to be able to scale up to retrieval in large knowledge bases.

As described here, SA essentially performs blind search in a semantic network.

Reference-contexts: For a large multi-domain KB, though, a redundant discrimination network would be prohibitively large, and searching it would be prohibitively complex [5]. Similar limitations apply to the related method of indexing concepts as graphs with hierarchies of subgraphs <ref> [4] </ref>. Another analogy retrieval approach is Thagard et. al.'s ARCS [9], which constructs a constraint network between the target and plausible bases and uses a connectionist relaxation algorithm on that network to calculate the relative quality of the plausible bases as analogues.

Reference-contexts: From a mathematical standpoint, a class of analyses that match more closely with ours are analyses of hierarchical planning such as the one reported in <ref> [6] </ref>. Like our analysis, Knoblock's investigates the degree to which search time can be lowered by breaking a deep search down into a sequence of smaller searches toward intermediate subgoal states.

Reference-contexts: Many case-based reasoning systems use a retrieval mechanism based on traversing discrimination networks (see <ref> [7] </ref> for an overview). This class of approaches requires that the set of features useful for retrieving a concept as an analogy is known at concept storage time, so that these features can be used to index the concept.

We will not give the derivation of this formula here, and will instead refer the interested reader to <ref> [11] </ref> for the full derivation. However, we will provide some intuitive evidence that this formula is the right one by pointing out that this function's graph gives the exact qualitative behavior we would expect from the SA algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This paper reports of the results of one such examination. We have looked at the behavior of a commonly-used class of retrieval algorithms the marker passing or spreading activation approach [1, 2, 3, 8, 10] and compared it to a technique called Knowledge-Directed Spreading Activation (KDSA) <ref> [12] </ref>, a method developed to be appropriate for retrieving semantically distant analogies. Our analysis is specifically designed to examine how the two approaches are affected by the required semantic distance of the analogy and by the size of the knowledge base from which the analogues are drawn. <p> We will give a very brief description of KDSA here; a more detailed description, and an example of its use, is presented in <ref> [12] </ref>. KDSA works by introducing a feedback cycle into the spreading activation process, as shown in Fig. 1. KDSA starts the same way as SA, by marking the nodes in the target concept and beginning the spread of activation starting from the target along the network's links.

Reference-contexts: We have identified several ways in which the Mapping and Search Control modules can interact to efficiently guide the search to an analogue, and we have implemented a specific set of heuristics for the task of creative design <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> We used an implementation of KDSA, called IDA, to perform such an experimental evaluation. IDA is a program that uses KDSA to search for an analogue that is useful for an innovative redesign of a given target device <ref> [13] </ref>. We observed KDSA's behavior by running the full IDA implementation, and we observed SA's behavior by running IDA without its mapping evaluation 1 and search control modules. We ran experiments with IDA retrieving analogues for innovative design in a diverse knowledge base of devices.

Reference-contexts: So far, the amount of work on combined theoretical and experimental analyses of analogy or case retrieval algorithms has been limited. One project that involved this sort of analysis is reported in <ref> [14] </ref>. This work is similar to ours in that Zito-Wolf and Alterman evaluated their approach to knowledge retrieval against other existing approaches both by developing a theoretical model of retrieval and by experimentally validating the theoretical results by measuring the execution of an implemented system.
