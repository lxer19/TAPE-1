Abstract: The MANIC project in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Mas-sachusetts is aimed towards facilitating individualized asynchronous distance learning. We take advantage of current technology, such as the World Wide Web and high-speed networks, to present a rich combination of text, graphics, and sound. We use student modeling to aid in the presentation of the material, including individualizing the instruction for each student and reducing the delays by predicting what the student will see next. In this paper, we present the initial work on the MANIC system and discuss the future possibilities and research.

Reference-contexts: The user clicks on a link that points to a RAM file. The browser sends a request to the WWW server for the file. 2. In response to the request, the RAM file is sent to the browser, with content-type field in the header <ref> [1] </ref> set to audio/x-pn-realaudio. 3. Based on the entry in the content-type field, the browser invokes the RealAudio player and hands to it the contents of the of the RAM file. 4.

Reference-contexts: However, a main focus of our current work is on the use of student modeling and intelligent tutoring. From an educational standpoint, it is imperative that we incorporate more intelligent tutoring properties into the current system <ref> [2] </ref>. One way to do this is to add quizzes which students can take on the 11 course material. The grades from these quizzes can be used to update a "student model", which is used to track a student's abilities on the topics within the course.

Reference-contexts: The student must then begin the audio again explicitly if desired. Because we want to allow students to browse the material in a non-linear fashion, we have decided to include a method in which students could jump to other parts of the course easily <ref> [3] </ref>. For this reason, we have included a table of contents which allows students to see the structure of the material as well as to jump to new material with one mouse click.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this goal it is essential to keep track of actions taken by individual users. The HTTP communication protocol does not support this as it is a stateless protocol. Hence single-session cookies <ref> [4] </ref> were used to create a "session" out of the stateless HTTP protocol. The cookies carry information such as user login name and visual preferences and allow user-specific actions (such as logging information in proper files) to be taken.

Reference-contexts: Interactivity is important in order to keep students interested in the material <ref> [5] </ref>. To provide for interactivity, students are given the opportunity to browse the material at their own pace, stopping and starting the audio at will.

Reference-contexts: Synchronous distance learning environments focus on creating an illusion of a classroom. This includes the delivery of live classroom lectures via satellite channels and video recordings of live classroom presentations. Internet-based conferencing tools have also been used to create live, networked distributed "classrooms" <ref> [6] </ref>. On the other hand, asynchronous systems are designed to allow students to use the software at any time, without simulating a classroom. With these systems, students proceed at their own pace and are not assumed to be accessing the same material at the same time as others. <p> This architecture provides a classroom like learning experience (unlike [8]), and also allows for asynchronous learning (unlike <ref> [6] </ref>). RealAudio codes audio for potential delivery over 28.8Kbps dialup lines and hence MANIC course materials can be accessed at home, at school, or at work. Our design also has provisions for a video server (MPEG) to be added as well, and we are currently adding this functionality.

Reference-contexts: If the "guess" made by the student model server is accurate, the download time for the document will be negligible, as the proxy will be able to serve the document from its local cache <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 The synchronized multimedia facility MANIC uses the synchronized multimedia facility provided by the RealAudio server/player to present courseware material to the users.

Reference-contexts: With these systems, students proceed at their own pace and are not assumed to be accessing the same material at the same time as others. The goal of these systems, such as the system described in <ref> [8] </ref>, is to serve as an easy-to-access repository of reference material. Our focus in MANIC is also on asynchronous learning environments, so students can access the software at any time without regard to others also using the software. <p> This architecture provides a classroom like learning experience (unlike <ref> [8] </ref>), and also allows for asynchronous learning (unlike [6]). RealAudio codes audio for potential delivery over 28.8Kbps dialup lines and hence MANIC course materials can be accessed at home, at school, or at work.

Reference-contexts: The hypertext links present related information to the student, sometimes in the form of review material and other times in the form of interesting sidenotes. However, when students access additional material, they should not lose the original context <ref> [9] </ref>. Therefore, when a student clicks on a hypertext link or chooses to view the index, an additional window is spawned to present that material.
