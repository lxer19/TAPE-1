Abstract: We consider the problem of on-line gradient descent learning for general two-layer neural networks. An analytic solution is presented and used to investigate the role of the learning rate in con Consider maps from an N -dimensional input space ~ onto a scalar , as arise in the formulation of classification and regression tasks. Two-layer networks with an arbitrary number of hidden units have been shown to be universal approximators [1] for such N -to-one dimensional maps. Information about the desired map ~ f is provided through independent examples (~ ; ), with = ~ f (~ ) for all . The examples are used to train a student network with N input units, K hidden units, and a single linear output unit; the target map ~ f is defined through a teacher network of similar architecture except for the number M of hidden units. We investigate the emergence of generalization ability in an on-line learning scenario [2], in which the couplings are modified after the presentation of each example so as to minimize the corresponding error. The resulting changes in fJg are described as a dynamical evolution; the number of examples plays the role of time. In this paper we limit our discussion to the case of the soft-committee machine [2], in which all the hidden units are connected to the output unit with positive couplings of unit strength, and only the input-to-hidden couplings are adaptive. trolling the evolution and convergence of the learning process.
