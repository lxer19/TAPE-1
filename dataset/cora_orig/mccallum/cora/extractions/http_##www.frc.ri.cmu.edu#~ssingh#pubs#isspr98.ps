Title: Abstract  
Keyword: efficient and optimal path planning, outdoor, mobile robots.  
Abstract: Mobile robots operating in vast outdoor unstructured environments often only have incomplete maps and must deal with new objects found during traversal. Path planning in such sparsely occupied regions must be incremental to accommodate new information and must use efficient representations. In this paper we report recent results in path planning using an efficient data structure (framed quadtrees) and an optimal algorithm (D*) to incorporate knowledge of the environment as it incrementally discovered. In particular, we show the difference in performance when the robot starts with no information about the world versus when it starts with partial information about the world. Our results indicate that, as would be expected, starting with partial information is better than starting with no information. However, in many cases, the effect of partial information is performance that is almost as good as starting out with complete information about the world, while the computational cost incurred is significantly lower. Our system has been tested in simulation as well on an autonomous jeep, equipped with local obstacle avoidance capabilities and results from both simulation and real experimentation are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Efficiency in map representation can be obtained by the use of quadtrees, but at a cost of optimality. Recently, a new data structure called a framed quadtree has been suggested as means to overcome some of the issues related to the use of quadtrees <ref> [2] </ref>. We have used this data structure to extend an existing path planner that has in the past used uniform (regular) grid cells to represent terrain. This path planner, D* [12] has been shown to optimally incorporate knowledge of the environment as it is incrementally discovered.

Reference-contexts: This is depicted in Figure 6. 5 Test Results on Autonomous Vehicle We have performed several tests on an automated military jeep (Fig. 7). Our vehicle uses a vertical-baseline stereo system to generate range images. The resulting images are processed by the SMARTY local navigator <ref> [4] </ref>, which handles local obstacle detection and avoidance. This obstacle map is fed to a global navigator running a path planning algorithm, such as framed-quadtree D*.

Reference-contexts: However, typical outdoor environments are often not only sparse but often if any information is available about the terrain, it is only at a coarse level. If complete and accurate maps were available, it would be sufficient to use A* <ref> [8] </ref> once to search the map and produce a path. The robot could simply follow this path during its traverse. Ideally, the robot should gather new information about the environment, and efficiently replan new paths based on this new information.

Reference-contexts: This obstacle map is fed to a global navigator running a path planning algorithm, such as framed-quadtree D*. Both the local and global navigators submit steering advice to an arbiter, which selects a steering command each time interval and passes it to the controller <ref> [13] </ref>. Fig. 8 shows the system modules and data ow. Fig. 9 shows a successful traverse of the vehicle that covered 200 meters in 6 minutes. During this traverse, the vehicle detected and avoided 80 obstacles. Fig. 10 shows a close-up of the data structure produced after the above run.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to produce a path based on all available information and replan from the current position to the goal every time new information is discovered. This is called Best Information Planning. This approach <ref> [14] </ref> has been shown to produce lower-cost traverses on average than other selected algorithms for unknown and partially-known environments. Furthermore, Best Information Planning is able to make use of prior information to reduce the traversal cost.

Reference-contexts: Coupling the two provides a method that is correct, resolution complete and resolution optimal. It also does this efficiently. The paths are always shorter, and in all but the most cluttered environments, it executes faster and uses less memory than when regular grids are used <ref> [16] </ref>. In general, the sparser or the more unknown the world is, the higher the advantages of using framed-quadtrees. In this paper we explain the rationale of using framed quadtrees along with D*. We describe the recent results of path planning in continuous-cost (simulated) fractal worlds. <p> cost map, that is, it directly produces the cost of traversing from one cell to another and can be thought of as a derivative of an elevation map. 4.1 Binary-Cost Worlds An extensive set of simulations were conducted using regular grids and framed quadtrees and the results are available in <ref> [16] </ref>. Here we simply show the difference in the path produced when framed-quadtrees are used as opposed to regular grids.
