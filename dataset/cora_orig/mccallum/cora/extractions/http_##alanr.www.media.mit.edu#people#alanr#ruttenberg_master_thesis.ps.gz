Reference-contexts: This would be would be tedious, time consuming, and extremely prone to error. A typical page of string quartet music contains a couple of thousand marks, whose type and position are significant. Further, 12 97, the third system. available representations for entering the information are limited <ref> [2] </ref>, either being extremely cumbersome, or in being unable to capture the full range of expression of a printed score.

Reference-contexts: Each of these problems has a separate solution. To attack the problem of thick lines, I used a thinning or skeletonizing algorithm invented by Zhang and Suen <ref> [3] </ref>. This image transform erodes the black areas in an image in such a way as to preserve the topological properties of regions, while leaving no more than a couple of pixels in a row black.

Reference-contexts: By length of a beam, I mean the distance between its leftmost and rightmost pixel, and by height, I mean the height at some particular point along the length of the beam (since 1 This differs slightly with <ref> [8] </ref>, who calls the complete object a beam, but also calls the individual lines primary and secondary beams, which doesn't adequately make the distinction between whole and part. 56 57 beams may have different numbers of ligatures at different points).
