Title: Utterance Units in Spoken Dialogue  
Author: David R. Traum and Peter A. Heeman 
Abstract: In order to make spoken dialogue systems more sophisticated, designers need to better understand the conventions that people use in structuring their speech and in interacting with their fellow con-versants. In particular, it is crucial to discriminate the basic building blocks of dialogue and how they affect the way people process language. Many researchers have proposed the utterance unit as the primary object of study, but defining exactly what this is has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrences between turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit signals that have been proposed in the literal, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses. Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses. We also consider some of the dialogue processing issues which are impacted by a definition of utterance unit.

Reference-contexts: In general, the division of contributions into more manageable sized utterance units, which can build up turns at speech, will be a more efficient mechanism for flexibly coordinating the contributions of the dialogue to reach a mutual understanding of what has been said. 4 GROUNDING Clark and Schaefer <ref> [5] </ref> call the process of adding to common ground between conversants grounding. They present a model of grounding in conversation, in which contributions are composed of two phases, presentations and acceptances. <p> These markers are also called backchannel items [20], or simply acknowledgments <ref> [5, 19] </ref>. This category shows relatedness to something, although it is usually not really possible to tell what exactly (if anything) it is related to.

Reference-contexts: TCUs may consist of differing types of syntactic contributions, including lexical, phrasal, clausal, and sentential constructions.

Email: heeman@cs.rochester.edu Analysts have proposed many different definitions of utterances and utterance units. The turn is the unit of dialogue that has most often been proposed for study as a basic utterance unit. Fries <ref> [8] </ref>, for example, uses the term utterance unit to denote those chunks of talk that are marked off by a shift of speaker. Some authors (e.g., [20]) also distinguish speaking-turns in which new information is conveyed from backchannel items, which are short responses such as ok, right, yeah, and mm-hm.

Reference-contexts: For the overlap cases, we looked for a boundary tone on the last complete word before the overlapping speech occurred. The distribution of the overlaps into tone and no-tone categories is still somewhat problematic, due to the potential projectability of IP boundaries <ref> [9] </ref>: a new speaker may judge that the end of a unit is coming up and merely anticipate (perhaps incorrectly) the occurrence of a tone.

Reference-contexts: One type of speech repair of particular interest is the fresh start, in which the speaker abandons what she is saying, and starts over. Exactly how much is abandoned is not explicitly signaled. Consider the following example from the TRAINS corpus <ref> [12] </ref> (d93-13.3 utt7), with intonation phrase endings marked as `%'. two hours % um okay % so um I guess I 'd like to take um and tankers only take orange juice right % In this example a fresh start occurs starting on the fourth line. <p> For instance, our corpus contains instances of overlapping speech, backchannel responses, and turn-taking: phenomena that do not occur in collections of single speaker utterances, such as ATIS [17]. For our current study, we looked at 26 dialogues from the TRAINS-93 corpus <ref> [12] </ref>. This totaled over 6000 seconds of spoken dialogue comprising 1411 total turn transitions. 6.1 Prosodic markings All turn-initial utterances are marked with respect to their direct relatedness to the previous full or partial intonation phrase (IP) by the previous speaker.

Reference-contexts: We briefly review some of these issues in this section. 3.1 Speech Repairs Heeman and Allen [11] propose that speech repairs should be resolved very early in speech processing. Speech repairs are repairs where the speaker repairs or repeats something she just said, as in this example from <ref> [13] </ref>. we'll pick up a tank of | -z -reparandum uh the tanker of | -z alteration oranges In the above example the speaker intends that the text marked as the reparandum be replaced by the alteration.

Reference-contexts: In its current incarnation, the break indices have a direct mapping to the intonational phrasing, but work by Wightman et al. [32] uses two additional levels above the intonational phrase. The first level (level 5) represents a superior major tone <ref> [14] </ref>, and the next level (level 6) is reserved for marking sentence boundaries. In this work, Wightman has not focused on spoken dialogue, but prepared text spoken by newscasters. Previous spoken dialogue research efforts in the TRAINS project have needed to take a stand on the issue of utterance segmentation.

Reference-contexts: Previous spoken dialogue research efforts in the TRAINS project have needed to take a stand on the issue of utterance segmentation. In looking at the relationship of prosody to discourse structure, Nakajima and Allen <ref> [18] </ref> used four principles to segment turns into utterance units: utterance units correspond to sentences of text, they can correspond to basic speech acts, they are at most a single turn, and they can be marked with a pause of at least 750 msec.

Reference-contexts: Acknowledgment acts include three types, explicit acknowledgments which are one of the feedback words, whether they appeared as a backchannel or not, paraphrases of material presented by the other speaker, and implicit acknowledgments, which display understanding through conditional relevance. Novick and Sutton <ref> [19] </ref> looked specifically at explicit acknowledgments, cataloging the interaction sequences that they play a part in. 5 GROUNDING AND RELATEDNESS For the purposes of determining an appropriate utterance unit boundary, we are not as concerned with whether something is ultimately grounded, but rather whether the responding agent starts the grounding process <p> These markers are also called backchannel items [20], or simply acknowledgments <ref> [5, 19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For instance, as most speakers of English implicitly know, a statement can be turned into a question by ending it with a rising pitch. Pierrehumbert <ref> [21] </ref> presented a model of intonation patterns that later was taken as part of the basis for the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) annotation scheme [26]. This model describes English intonation as a series of highs (H) and lows (L).

Reference-contexts: The highest level of analysis is the intonational phrase (IP), which is made up of one or more intermediate phrases and ends with an additional high or low tone, the boundary tone, which controls how the pitch contour ends. Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg <ref> [22] </ref> theorize that boundary tones play a considerable role in the conveyance and perception of discourse segmentation.

Reference-contexts: The identified utterance units thus correspond roughly to Pierrehumbert's IPs, although they also split IPs at points of disfluency. There have also been some more radical proposals for smaller basic units. For example, Poesio <ref> [23] </ref> proposed that each word or morpheme be a basic unit, accessible to all aspects of the discourse processing, including semantics, reference resolution, and dialogue management. <p> For one thing, the basic decision of when and how to respond to input from a user can be informed by awareness of utterance units. Even if full discourse processing of language proceeds within an utterance unit, as suggested by <ref> [23] </ref>, the decision of when to respond still mainly follows regular patterns, occurring at regular places [24]. Awareness of the markers for turn-endings and TRPs can help with the decision of when to respond and when to wait for further input.

Reference-contexts: We conclude with some observations on how to extend this study and some implications for spoken dialogue systems. 2 PROPOSALS FOR SUB-TURN UTTERANCE UNITS Sacks et. al, <ref> [24] </ref> present a theory of the organization of turns as composed of turn-constructional units (TCUs). <p> Even if full discourse processing of language proceeds within an utterance unit, as suggested by [23], the decision of when to respond still mainly follows regular patterns, occurring at regular places <ref> [24] </ref>. Awareness of the markers for turn-endings and TRPs can help with the decision of when to respond and when to wait for further input. More importantly, the nature of the previous utterance unit can be a good signal of how to respond.

Reference-contexts: This can be a demonstration style acknowledgment (i.e., repetition or paraphrase of a previous utterance by the other speaker), a repair or repair request, or some kind of continuation. Any second part to an adjacency pair <ref> [25] </ref> (such as an answer to a question) would fit in this category.

Reference-contexts: Pierrehumbert [21] presented a model of intonation patterns that later was taken as part of the basis for the ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) annotation scheme <ref> [26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: From a purely functional point of view, many analysts have found the turn too large a unit for convenient analysis. Fries, for example, noted that his utterance units could contain multiple sentences. Sin-clair and Coulthard <ref> [27] </ref>, found that their basic unit of interaction, the exchange, cut across individual turns. Instead, they use moves and acts as the basic single-speaker components of exchanges. A single turn might consist of several different moves, which might be part of different exchanges. <p> As an example, the theory of Sinclair and Coulthard <ref> [27] </ref>, mentioned above, is composed of hierarchical actions, some of which occur across speaker turns, and some of which occur within the turn of a single speaker. The notion of an utterance unit could be useful in isolating which span of speech represents particular tank of action.

Reference-contexts: This position has some attractions because there is psycholinguistic evidence that people do in fact use context even at such basic levels and are able to act appropriately (e.g., by gazing at an object) as soon as the necessary words to disambiguate the meaning are heard <ref> [28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These include feedback words such as ok, right, and mm-hm, repetition of the previous content, and initiation of a next relevant contribution. Completions and repairs of presentations of the contributor also play a role in the grounding process. Traum and Allen <ref> [29] </ref> built on this work, presenting a speech acts approach to grounding, in which utterances are seen as actions affecting the state of grounding of contributed material. <p> We thus use a less detailed labeling of utterances than that of <ref> [29] </ref>, with a slightly different focus. We lump the repair, request for repair, and the paraphrase and implicit categories of acknowledgment together into one category we call related. <p> Prevalence of Grounding Behavior These results give strong evidence of grounding behavior at turn transitions. Fully 80% of utterance display grounding behavior, while another 15% occur in positions in which (according to the theory of <ref> [29, 31] </ref>) further grounding is unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: If it is, then it might be a counterexample to the hypothesis that fresh starts just cancel the current utterance. Although the hearer does not take up this suggestion, a satisfactory alternate explanation is that it is his discourse obligation to first respond to the speaker's question <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The notion of an utterance unit could be useful in isolating which span of speech represents particular tank of action. Also, the multilevel conversation act theory proposed in <ref> [31] </ref> used an utterance unit distinction. In that proposal, turn-taking acts occurred within utterance units, grounding acts (see Section 4) occurred at the utterance unit level, and traditional core speech acts were composed of multiple utterance units. <p> Obviously, for such a theory, the nature of an utterance unit will affect how some acts are classified. For example, the set of grounding acts from <ref> [31] </ref> included acts for repair and continue functions. Trivially, smaller utterance units would lead to more continue acts, but consider the case in which a repair (e.g., a speech repair) occurs within an utterance unit. <p> Prevalence of Grounding Behavior These results give strong evidence of grounding behavior at turn transitions. Fully 80% of utterance display grounding behavior, while another 15% occur in positions in which (according to the theory of <ref> [29, 31] </ref>) further grounding is unnecessary.
