Title: MM90: A Scalable Parallel Implementation of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5)

Abstract: This paper describes MM90, a parallel regional weather model based on the Penn State/NCAR MM5. Parallelization of finite differencing, horizontal interpolation, and nesting on distributed-memory (message-passing) computers is handled transparently using the RSL library package. Fortran90 modules, derived data types, dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and recursion are used, making the code modular, flexible, extensible, and run-time configurable. The model can dynamically sense and correct load imbalances. The paper provides performance, scaling, and load-balancing data collected on the IBM SP2 computers at Argonne National Laboratory and NASA Ames Laboratory. Future work will address the impact of parallel modifications on existing modeling software; an approach using commercially available source translation software is described.

It is a primitive-equations model employing finite differencing on an Arakawa-B grid for the computation of atmospheric dynamics (advection and diffusion) under both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic assumptions, both of which employ time splitting.
