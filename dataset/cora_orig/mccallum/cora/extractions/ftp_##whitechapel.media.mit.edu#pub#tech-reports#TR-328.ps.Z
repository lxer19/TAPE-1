Abstract: Batteries add size, weight, and inconvenience to present day mobile computers. This paper explores the possibility of harnessing the energy expended during the user's everyday actions to generate power for his computer, thus eliminating the impediment of batteries. An analysis of power generation through leg motion is presented in depth, and a survey of less practical methods such as generation by breath or blood pressure, body heat, and finger and limb motion is also presented.

Reference-contexts: Most of this power is generated by moving the upper limbs. Empirical studies done by <ref> [3] </ref> at the turn of the century show that for a particular 58.7 kg man, the lower arm plus hand masses 1.4 kg, the upper arm 1.8 kg, and the whole arm 3.2 kg. <p> Comparing this to standing or a strolling rate implies that up to half this power is being used for moving the legs. While walking, the traveller puts up to 30% more force on the balls of his feet than that provided by his body weight (Figure while walking (from <ref> [3] </ref>). This data curve should scale roughly based on weight. 1). However, calculating the power that can be generated by simply using the fall of the heel through 5 cm (the approximate vertical distance that a heel travels in the human gait [3]) reveals that (68kg)( sec 2 )(0:05m)( 2steps sec <p> by his body weight (Figure while walking (from <ref> [3] </ref>).

Adding a turbine to the system would increase the load on the heart, perhaps dangerously so.

Reference-contexts: Even so, the practicality, comfort, and efficacy of such a system are relatively limited. 3 Breath An average person of 68 kg has an approximate air intake rate of 30 liters per minute [22]. However, available breath pressure is only 2% above atmospheric pressure <ref> [11, 24] </ref>. Increasing the effort required for intake of breath may have adverse physiological effects [24] so only exhalation will be considered for generation of energy.

Reference-contexts: The most direct solution to the problem of electrical storage is to charge capacitors that can be drained for power during periods of no generation. However, simply charging the capacitor results in the loss of half the available power <ref> [12] </ref>. Unfortunately, a purely capacitive solution to the problem is also restricted by size. Current small (less than 16 cm 3 ) 5 V supercapacitors are rated for approximately 3 Farads. Thus, only E = (0:5)CV = (0:5)(3F )(5V ) = 37:5J of energy can be stored.

Reference-contexts: This "insensible perspiration" consists of water diffusing through the skin; sweat glands keeping the skin of the palms and soles pliable; and the expulsion of water-saturated air from the lungs <ref> [13] </ref>. Thus, the maximum power available, without trying to reclaim heat expended by the latent heat of vaporization, drops to 2.8-4.8 W. The above efficiences assume that all of the heat radiated by the body is captured and perfectly transformed into power. <p> However, such a system would encapsulate the user in something similar to a wetsuit. The reduced temperature at the location of the heat exchanger would cause the body to restrict blood flow to that area <ref> [13] </ref>. When the skin surface encounters cold air, a rapid constriction of the blood vessels in the skin allows the skin temperature to approach the temperature of the interface so that heat exchange is reduced. <p> Forcing an elevated breath pressure with an aircraft-style pressure mask can increase the available power by a factor of 2.5, but it causes significant stress on the user <ref> [13] </ref>. Harnessing the energy from breathing involves breath masks which encumber the user. For some professionals such as military aircraft pilots, astronauts, or handlers of hazardous materials, such masks are already in place.

Reference-contexts: Harnessing the energy from breathing involves breath masks which encumber the user. For some professionals such as military aircraft pilots, astronauts, or handlers of hazardous materials, such masks are already in place. However, the efficiency of a turbine and generator combination is only about 40% <ref> [14] </ref>, and any attempt to tap this energy source would provide additional load on the user. Thus, the benefit of the estimated 0.40 W of recoverable power has to be weighed against the other, more convenient methods discussed in the following sections.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, neither method provides enough continuous power to sustain a portable computer, especially since the user would not be continuously typing on the keyboard. However, there may be enough energy in each keystroke for each key to "announce" its character to a nearby receiver <ref> [15] </ref>. For example, the keyboard may have a permanent magnet in its base. Each key would then have an embedded coil that would generate a current when the key was moved. Another possibility is to use PVDF which bends at each keystroke to generate energy (again, 11% efficiency).

Reference-contexts: Also, shaping PVDF can reduce the effective coupling of mechanical and electrical energies due to edge effects. Furthermore, the material's efficiency degrades depending on the operating climate and the number of plies used. Fortunately, from an industry representative <ref> [16] </ref>, we know a 116 cm 2 40 ply triangular plate with a center metal shim deflected 5 cm by 68 kg 3 times every 5 seconds results in the generation of 1.5 W of power.

Reference-contexts: First however, the power must be converted to a useable form. For the piezoelectric method, a step down transformer and regulator would be needed. Current strategies for converting the high voltages generated by piezoelectric materials to computer voltage levels can attain over 90% efficiency <ref> [18] </ref>. Care is needed to match the high impedance of the piezo generator properly, and, due to the low currents involved, the actual efficiency may be lower. For the other generation methods, power regulators would be needed as well, and aggressive strategies can attain 93% efficiency.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wearable computing is an effort to make computers truly part of our everyday lives by embedding them into our clothing (e.g. shoes) or by creating form factors that can be used like clothing (e.g. sunglasses) <ref> [28] </ref>. This level of access to computation will revolutionize how computers are used. While the computational hardware has been reduced in size to accommodate this vision, power systems are still bulky and inconvenient. <p> seems pointless to pursue a hard-to-recover energy source which can only yield 3% of the user's total energy when leg motion may consume over 50% of the total energy during the same activity. 7 Finger motion Keyboards will continue to be a major interface for computers into the next decade <ref> [28] </ref>. As such, typing may provide a useful source of energy. On a one-handed chording keyboard (HandyKey's Twiddler), it is necessary to apply 130 grams of pressure in order to depress a key the required 1 mm for it to register. <p> At first this trend was pushed by laptop computers. With the advent of pen computing and PDA's, components have become even smaller and more manageable. Now it is possible to make a computer which can be worn and run constantly <ref> [28] </ref>. For example, the author's wearable computer requires 5 W of power to run all components continuously (head mounted display, hard disk, 25 MHz 80386 CPU, 8M RAM, serial/parallel/PCMCIA ports, etc.) A standard off-the-shelf 1 kg gel cell battery can provide this unit power for 6 hours.

Reference-contexts: Interface devices, such as keyboards, displays, and speakers, have limitations as to their placement on the body. However, these devices may communicate wirelessly via a "body network" as described by Zimmerman <ref> [32] </ref>. They may generate their own power, share in a power distribution system with the main generator (wired or wireless), or use extremely long lasting batteries. Thus, depending on the user interface desired, wires may not be needed for power or data transfer amoung the components of a wearable computer.
