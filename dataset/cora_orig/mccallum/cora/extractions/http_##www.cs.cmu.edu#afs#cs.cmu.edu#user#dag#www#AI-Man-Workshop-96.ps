Abstract: Increased reliance on agile manufacturing techniques has created a demand for systems to solve integrated process-planning and production-scheduling problems in large-scale dynamic environments. To be effective, these systems should provide user-oriented interactive functionality for managing the various user tasks and objectives and reacting to unexpected events. This paper describes the mixed-initiative problem-solving features of IP3S, an Integrated Process-Planning/Production-Scheduling shell for agile manufacturing. IP3S is a blackboard -based system that supports the concurrent development and dynamic revision of integrated process-planning and production-scheduling solutions and the maintenance of multiple problem instances and solutions, as well as other flexible user-oriented decision-making capabilities, allowing the user to control the scope of the problem and explore alternate tradeoffs (what-if scenarios) interactively. The system is scheduled for initial deployment and evaluation in a large and highly dynamic machine shop at Raytheon's Andover manufacturing facility.

Reference-contexts: The IP3S Blackboard Architecture The use of blackboard architectures as a vehicle for integrating multiple sources of knowledge to solve complex problems has been demonstrated in a variety of application domains (e.g., speech understanding <ref> (Erman et al. 1980) </ref>, signal interpretation (Nii et al. 1982; Lesser & Corkill 1983), scheduling (Smith 1994; Hildum 1994)). Blackboard architectures emphasize modular encapsulation of problem-solving knowledge within independent knowledge sources.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe the mixed-initiative problem-solving capabilities of IP3S, an Integrated Process-Planning and Production Scheduling shell for agile manufacturing <ref> (Sadeh et al. 1996) </ref>. <p> In their survey of prior efforts to integrate process planning and production scheduling, Huang et al. identify three distinct approaches (Huang, Zhang, & Smith 1995).

Even with the support of sophisticated state-of-the-art computer-aided process-planning and scheduling techniques, process planning and production scheduling remain highly interactive processes, where the user has to be able to evaluate alternative decisions based on experience and knowledge that is not easily amenable to computer modeling.
