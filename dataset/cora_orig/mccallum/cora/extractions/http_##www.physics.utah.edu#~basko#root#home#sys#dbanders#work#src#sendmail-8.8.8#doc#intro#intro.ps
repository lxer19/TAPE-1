Abstract: Routing mail through a heterogenous internet presents many new problems. Among the worst of these is that of address mapping. Historically, this has been handled on an ad hoc basis. However, this approach has become unmanageable as internets grow. In a simple network, each node has an address, and resources can be identified with a host-resource pair; in particular, the mail system can refer to users using a host-username pair. Host names and numbers have to be administered by a central authority, but usernames can be assigned locally to each host. In an internet, multiple networks with different characterstics and managements must communicate. In particular, the syntax and semantics of resource identification change. Certain special cases can be handled trivially by ad hoc techniques, such as providing network names that appear local to hosts on other networks, as with the Ethernet at Xerox PARC. However, the general case is extremely complex. For example, some networks require point-to-point routing, which simplifies the database update problem since only adjacent hosts must be entered into the system tables, while others use end-to-end addressing. Some networks use a left-associative syntax and others use a right-associative syntax, causing ambiguity in mixed addresses. Internet standards seek to eliminate these problems. Initially, these proposed expanding the address pairs to address triples, consisting of -network, host, resource triples. Network numbers must be universally agreed upon, and hosts can be assigned locally on each network. The user-level presentation was quickly expanded to address domains, comprised of a local resource identification and a hierarchical domain specification with a common static root. The domain technique separates the issue of physical versus logical addressing. For example, an address of the form eric@a.cc.berkeley.arpa describes only the logical organization of the address space.

Reference-contexts: 1. DESIGN GOALS Design goals for sendmail include: (1) Compatibility with the existing mail programs, including Bell version 6 mail, Bell version 7 mail [UNIX83], Berkeley Mail [Shoens79], BerkNet mail [Schmidt79], and hopefully UUCP mail [Nowitz78a, Nowitz78b]. ARPANET mail <ref> [Crocker77a, Postel77] </ref> was also required. (2) Reliability, in the sense of guaranteeing that every message is correctly delivered or at least brought to the attention of a human for correct disposal; no message should ever be completely lost. <p> Forwarding also permits a user to specify a private incoming mailer. For example, forwarding to: "| /usr/local/newmail myname" will use a different incoming mailer. 3.3.3. Inclusion Inclusion is specified in RFC 733 <ref> [Crocker77a] </ref> syntax: :Include: pathname An address of this form reads the file specified by pathname and sends to all users listed in that file. The intent is not to support direct use of this feature, but rather to use this as a subset of aliasing.

Reference-contexts: MMDF MMDF <ref> [Crocker79] </ref> spans a wider problem set than sendmail. For example, the domain of MMDF includes a phone network mailer, whereas sendmail calls on preexisting mailers in most cases. MMDF and sendmail both support aliasing, customized mailers, message batching, automatic forwarding to gateways, queueing, and retransmission.

Reference-contexts: This provides a compiled form of the configuration file. 3. USAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION 3.1. Arguments Arguments may be ags and addresses. Flags set various processing options. Following ag arguments, address arguments may be given, unless we are running in SMTP mode. Addresses fol low the syntax in RFC822 <ref> [Crocker82] </ref> for ARPANET address formats. In brief, the format is: (1) Anything in parentheses is thrown away (as a comment). (2) Anything in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) is preferred over anything else.

Reference-contexts: This goal derives as much from political and practical considerations as technical. (4) Easy expansion to fairly complex environments, including multiple connections to a single network type (such as with multiple UUCP or Ether nets <ref> [Metcalfe76] </ref>). This goal requires consideration of the contents of an address as well as its syntax in order to determine which gateway to use. For example, the ARPANET is bringing up the TCP protocol to replace the old NCP protocol.

Reference-contexts: The configuration file is currently practically inscrutable; considerable convenience could be realized with a higher-level format. It seems clear that common protocols will be changing soon to accommodate changing requirements and environments. These changes will include modifications to the message header (e.g., <ref> [NBS80] </ref>) or to the body of the message itself (such as for multimedia messages [Postel80]). Experience indicates that these changes should be relatively trivial to integrate into the existing system.

Reference-contexts: This discipline allows the insertion of new mailers at minimum cost. In this sense sendmail resembles the Message Processing Module (MPM) of <ref> [Postel79b] </ref>. 2.2. Interfaces to the Outside World There are three ways sendmail can communicate with the outside world, both in receiving and in sending mail. <p> MMDF strictly separates the submission and delivery phases. Although sendmail has the concept of each of these stages, they are integrated into one program, whereas in MMDF they are split into two programs. 4.3. Message Processing Module The Message Processing Module (MPM) discussed by Postel <ref> [Postel79b] </ref> matches sendmail closely in terms of its basic architecture. However, like M MDF, the MPM includes the network interface software as part of its domain. <p> Every attempt is made to avoid imposing unnecessary constraints on the underlying mailers. This goal has driven much of the design. One of the major problems has been the lack of a uniform address space, as postulated in [Pos-tel79a] and <ref> [Postel79b] </ref>. A nonuniform address space implies that a path will be specified in all addresses, either explicitly (as part of the address) or implicitly (as with implied forwarding to gateways).

As a more interesting case, the CSNET name server <ref> [Solomon81] </ref> provides an facility that goes beyond a single tightly-coupled environment. Such a facility would normally exist outside of sendmail however.
