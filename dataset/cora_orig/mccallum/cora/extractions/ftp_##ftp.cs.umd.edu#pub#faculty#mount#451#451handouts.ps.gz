Abstract: Course Overview: This course presents the fundamental techniques for designing efficient computer algorithms, proving their correctness, and analyzing their running times. General topics include review of asymptotics, mathematical analysis of algorithms (summations and recurrences), algorithm design techniques (such as divide-and-conquer, depth-first search, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms), graph algorithms (breadth-first and depth first search, biconnectivity, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths), NP-completeness and approximation algorithms. Course Work: Course work will consist of (around 6) homework assignments (about one every week and a half), a programming assignment, and 2 exams (a midterm and a comprehensive final). The programming assignment may be written in either C or C++. Homeworks are to be turned by the start of class on the due date. No late homeworks will be accepted, but the lowest homework grade will be dropped. (In other words, turn in what you have by the start of class. If your schedule is too busy, just drop the homework.) In exceptional circumstances (illness, university business, religious observances) extensions may be granted. However, all extensions must be approved by me BEFORE the due date.
