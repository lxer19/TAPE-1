Abstract: A large corpus (about 100 MB of text) was selected and examples of 750 frequently occurring verbs were tagged with their complement class as defined by a large computational syntactic dictionary, COMLEX Syntax. This tagging task led to the refinement of already existing classes and to the addition of classes that had previously not been defined. This has resulted in the enrichment and improvement of the original COMLEX Syntax dictionary. Tagging also provides statistical data which will allow users to select more common complements of a particular verb and ignore rare usage. We discuss below some of the problems encountered in tagging and their resolu tion.

Reference-contexts: These classes were augmented and further refined by studying the coding employed by several other major lexicons used for automated language analysis. The Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) <ref> (Hornby, 1980) </ref>, the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Proctor, 1978), the verb codes developed for English by Sanfilippo as part of the ACQUILEX project (Sanfilippo, 1992), and The Brandeis Verb Lexicon 2 were consulted. A Brandeis-like notation was adopted for COM-LEX complement names.
