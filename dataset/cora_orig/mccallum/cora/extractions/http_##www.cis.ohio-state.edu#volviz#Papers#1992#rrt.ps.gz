Reference-contexts: We have introduced elsewhere [7] voxelization algorithms for 3D lines, 3D cir-o cles, and a variety of surfaces and solids, including polygons, polyhedra, and quadric bjects.

Such an algorithm utilizes t a 3D discrete line voxelization mechanism to generate the sequence of voxels along he ray. Such line algorithms have previously been devised for uniform space-t subdivision ray tracing. Fujimoto et al <ref> [5] </ref> have presented a 3DDDA algorithm.

These scenes 3 were generated by randomly distributing an increasing number of spheres inside the D raster. The top row of Table 2 shows that indeed voxelization time grows linearly e to the scene complexity.
