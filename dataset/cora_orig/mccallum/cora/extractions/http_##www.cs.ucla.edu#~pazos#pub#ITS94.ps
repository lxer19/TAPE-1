Abstract: In this section we shall present the results obtained by applying the two formulations proposed in this paper to a case study. With respect to the service characterization, we considered a network offering only three different service types which we found reasonable to characterize a multiservice network while reducing the amount of data to be presented here (Table 1). On table 2 we present, for the call blocking minimization approach, the available capacity in each fiber trunk, the amount of fiber capacity allocated to second order arcs and the remaining capacity left idle on the fiber trunks. Note that with this approach there is a tendency to allocate all the available bandwidth as predicted earlier. On table 3 we present the corresponding results produced by the utilization minimization formulation. As it is implied by its name, with this formulation only the strictly necessary capacity is allocated in the fiber trunks as can be seen on the table. One can note that now we have plenty of idle capacity on the fiber trunks. From a practical implementation point of view where the dynamic reconfiguration must be processed in real time, the utilization minimization approach is much more efficient. For the case study presented, the call blocking minimization approach took some 7 min to reach its results while the utilization approach took only 17 s. In both cases, the algorithms were excecuted on a SPARC Server 630MP. Hence, from an efficiency point of view the utilization minimization approach is more likely to be chosen for a real implementation.
