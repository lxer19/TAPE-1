Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive protocol for packet-level forward error correction in dynamic networks. The objective is to facilitate end-to-end transport of real-time traffic whose timing constraints rule out the use of retransmission-based congestion control and quality of service (QoS) provision schemes. The degree of redundancy injected into the network is adjusted as a function of network state, decreasing when the network is well-behaved and increasing when it is not. The control problem is nontrivial due to the fact that increased redundancy, beyond a certain point, can backfire resulting in self-induced congestion which impedes the timely recovery of information at the receiver. First, we give a comprehensive analysis of the control problem associated with adaptive forward error correction, concentrating on the dynamics of a particular protocol called Adaptive Forward Error Correction (AFEC). We show that instabilities can arise from two distinct sources|the desired operating point and network delay|and we give solutions to handle them. The first factor is determined by the stringency of the application's QoS requirements, making its achievement potentially perilous. Second, we present simulation results showing the dynamics of AFEC and comparing its performance against static FEC. We study the efficacy of AFEC under structural perturbations and bursty traffic conditions, and we quantitatively estimate the redundancy-recovery rate function which relates redundancy to the QoS rendered at the receiver. We show that the curve is unimodal, its curvature being determined by whether a connection is packet loss or delay dominated. fl Supported in part by NSF grant ANI-9714707.

Introduction Forward error correction (FEC) is a well-studied reliable communication technique which has been successfully used, primarily at the bit-level, in a number of application domains from space communication to reliable data storage on compact disks <ref> [2, 13, 14] </ref>. The idea of FEC is simple: given a communication channel with known error probabilities, use error correcting codes to inject redundant information into the transmission such that a desired recovery rate|i.e., probability of successful decoding at the receiver of code blocks|is achieved.

Reference-contexts: Hence (3.1) may be rewritten as dh (t) = *(fl fl G (h (t t 0 ))) (3.3) where t 0 = t + ignoring the processing delay at the receiver. Equation (3.3) is a nonlinear autonomous delay differential equation <ref> [8] </ref> and the study of its behavior is the subject matter at hand. Two forms of instability may arise, one from the value of the desired operating point (h fl ; fl fl ), and another stemming from the delay term t 0 in equation (3.3). <p> If t 0 is sufficiently large, then the oscillation can become unbounded leading to a different causal aspect of instability. We use a modified form of the Stable Manifold Theorem, adopted to the case of nonlinear autonomous delay differential equations <ref> [8] </ref>, to relate the stability of the nonlinear system to the stability property of the linearized system around a rest point. We assume sufficient smoothness and boundedness on G.
