Abstract: This paper describes a study of coordination issues in optimistic distributed simulations that are implemented over a loosely coupled environment. Detailed study of relations among the factors such as the number, the depth and the frequency of rollbacks, the event intensity, and the speedup of the distributed simulations are studied. This study shows that centralized coordination can perform very effectively in certain types of simulation tasks; the rollbacks have different characteristics at different event intensities; and how the overall performance of optimistic distributed simulations is affected by message intensity, communications overhead, and rollback frequency.

Reference-contexts: Carothers et.al. (1994) studied explicitly the effect of communication overheads on the Time Warp performance. The study of distributed simulation of computer networks can be traced back to as early as late 1970s <ref> (Chandy et. al, 1979) </ref>. Ferscha & Tripathi (1994) listed a brief survey of different mechanisms used to calculate GVC.

Reference-contexts: A key to the success of a distributed simulation is how to coordinate all participating agents. Typically in optimistic PADS, each agent proceeds at its own pace. If an external, out-of-chronological-order event (straggler) <ref> (Ferscha & Tripathi, 1994) </ref> is received by an agent, the agent performs a rollback by canceling all events generated after the timestamp of the straggler at this agent. This rollback may trigger more rollbacks on other agents. <p> A GVC is defined as the minimum value of timestamps of all events including transit events in the system (for a general discussion of GVC, see, for example Ferscha & Tripathi (1994) ). There are different ways of calculating GVC <ref> (Ferscha & Tripathi, 1994) </ref>, decentralized or centralized. The use of a bus LP enables centralized calculation of GVC in our simulation. The protocol of calculating GVC is the following.
