Abstract: Future high-speed networks (HSNs) are expected to support a wide variety of services such as voice and video and provide a guaranteed quality-of-service (QOS). Traditionally, the computation of user-oriented performance criteria such as the average delay has been carried out via steady state analysis of queueing theoretic models of communication networks. In this paper, we show that the steady state analysis is not entirely sufficient for QOS purposes in future high-speed networks as it yields long-run performance measures that are not appropriate for envisaged applications in HSNs. New QOS criteria for such applications are proposed and their computation detailed for some simple queueing models. These new QOS criteria essentially capture the network performance over the short-run and are more accurate indicators of the actual user-perceived quality of, for example, audio or video. For the numerical examples presented in this paper, our focus will be primarily on the fractional packet loss and we will be interested in the probability (frequency) of occurence of high or low loss "periods". When our interest is in maximizing the occurence of no loss periods, we show for the M=M=1=K queue that reasonably high values of traffic load may be supported and fairly good QOS (as defined in this paper) provided to applications. In this context, steady state analysis is found to be woefully inadequate. On the other hand, when we are interested in minimizing the occurence of high loss periods, we find for a packet voice multiplexer that large values of the carried load may not be supportable while providing an acceptable QOS.

Reference-contexts: The work on transient analysis can be broadly classified into two different categories. Most of the work focuses on time-dependent point statistics of system random variables such as the mean number in queue at some time t <ref> [Mor58, Moo75, Kot78, OR83, As86, Gra77, L + 90] </ref>. More recent work, however, focuses on cumulative measures rather than on point measures. The work of [Fil88, Gra87, RT88, S + 88] details computation of the so-called time averages which are cumulative performance measures over finite time intervals.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, long-run criteria appear inappropriate for envisaged voice and video services in BISDN <ref> [Ram88, RW90, Bra90, Sha90, KV89, Bie91, PZ93] </ref>; short-term metrics such as the packet delays in talkspurts [RW90, Bra90] and the packet loss within blocks of packets for packet video [Sha90, KV89, Bie91, PZ93] are deemed more appropriate. <p> Secondly, long-run criteria appear inappropriate for envisaged voice and video services in BISDN [Ram88, RW90, Bra90, Sha90, KV89, Bie91, PZ93]; short-term metrics such as the packet delays in talkspurts [RW90, Bra90] and the packet loss within blocks of packets for packet video <ref> [Sha90, KV89, Bie91, PZ93] </ref> are deemed more appropriate.

Finally, Pancha and Zarki [PZ93] propose the fractional packet loss in a video frame as a measure of QOS for evaluating certain bandwidth reservation mechanisms for MPEG video sources. The above proposed QOS criteria will need to be satisfied on an end-to-end basis for applications in HSNs.

Reference-contexts: We shall consider this performance metric, briefly, in the next section.

Closed-form expressions for the time-averaged behaviour in the M=M=1=K queue will be used to demonstrate 6 certain qualitative convergence characteristics of cumulative performance measures.

Reference-contexts: The entire distribution of A P (1; n) conditioned on X (A 1 ) = m, when the performance metric of interest is the fractional packet loss, can be computed via a simple recursive computation as in <ref> [C + 92] </ref>. However, this computation is O (K 2 n 2 ) and hence is considerably expensive. Also, when the fractional packet loss values of interest are rather small the mass at zero is sufficient for purposes of QOS guarantees (see Section 5 and [Nag93]). <p> Hence for purposes of this paper, we resort to the above computation of the mass at zero which is O (K 2 ) for a fixed n. Further, the computation in <ref> [C + 92] </ref> does not apply for general performance metrics. <p> For the particular case of the fractional packet loss, one could possibly improve on the computation presented in <ref> [C + 92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Then we consider the computation of the violation level for voice calls as a function of the offered load, connection duration, and loss QOS requirements. The model we assume for a voice source is a standard one (see, e.g., <ref> [DL86, HL86, SW86, N + 91] </ref>) and has as its basic premise that an active voice source periodically generates fixed length packets when a speaker is speaking (talkspurt) and otherwise remains idle.

Reference-contexts: The customer average over intervals (arrivals) is not necessarily identical, in general, for the composite stream and the individual streams composing it even if the streams are identical. Preliminary results in <ref> [Nag93] </ref> appear to indicate that the customer average values for the aggregate stream may be used as a pessimistic approximation for the individual stream values. For purposes of this paper, we hence focus on a single connection stream. <p> The interested reader will find a corresponding (more involved) analysis for A C (t 1 ; t 2 ) and A I (T; ) in <ref> [Nag93] </ref>. A detailed treatment of time-averages may be found in [S + 88, Gra87, RT89]. Statistics such as the mean and variance of the customer average are computed in Appendices A and B. Our analysis in the next section focuses on the mass at zero for the customer average. <p> However, this computation is O (K 2 n 2 ) and hence is considerably expensive. Also, when the fractional packet loss values of interest are rather small the mass at zero is sufficient for purposes of QOS guarantees (see Section 5 and <ref> [Nag93] </ref>). Hence for purposes of this paper, we resort to the above computation of the mass at zero which is O (K 2 ) for a fixed n. Further, the computation in [C + 92] does not apply for general performance metrics. <p> L s V : Steady state loss probability at a given offered load for the voice multiplexer. Note that we can similarly define quantities for the time-interval based metrics by replacing in the above definitions n by T and l by (see <ref> [Nag93] </ref>). The successive connection durations n in the connection model may simply be thought of as groups of n packets. The violation level for the connection-duration-based criteria is then simply the fraction of packet groups (of length n) that violate a given QOS criteria. <p> However, stringent fractional packet loss QOS requirements of 10 04 to 10 09 may be expected [YW89]. For the small packet loss values of interest, we hence conjecture that the above bounds will be tight (see also <ref> [Nag93] </ref>). Now we consider the packet-group-based QOS criteria.

Reference-contexts: The above proposed QOS criteria will need to be satisfied on an end-to-end basis for applications in HSNs. However, we assume in this paper that the end-to-end QOS criterion are mapped to nodal criterion by a suitable mechanism (see, for example, <ref> [NKT93] </ref>). It is shown in [NKT93] that a simple equal allocation of the end-to-end steady-state loss probability requirement for a connection to individual nodes on the source-destination path is comparable in performance to an optimal allocation. <p> The above proposed QOS criteria will need to be satisfied on an end-to-end basis for applications in HSNs.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach may be insufficient for the purposes of QOS guarantees for a number of reasons. First, under realistic network conditions connection durations are finite (for example, the average (accepted) toll call duration in the AT&T telephone network is about five minutes <ref> [oBTS77] </ref>) and hence the value of long-run averages in providing QOS guarantees is questionable.

Reference-contexts: The work on transient analysis can be broadly classified into two different categories. Most of the work focuses on time-dependent point statistics of system random variables such as the mean number in queue at some time t <ref> [Mor58, Moo75, Kot78, OR83, As86, Gra77, L + 90] </ref>. More recent work, however, focuses on cumulative measures rather than on point measures. The work of [Fil88, Gra87, RT88, S + 88] details computation of the so-called time averages which are cumulative performance measures over finite time intervals. <p> The time-dependent term in the equation above is of the form 1e flt flt . The exponential 7 term dominates at small time while at large time scales the behaviour is O (1=t). Contrast this to the general observation in <ref> [OR83] </ref> that the time-dependent point values approach the steady state values exponentially fast for large time.

Reference-contexts: In this case, one could use the mass at zero for general metrics computed above or alternatively, one could employ the mean and variance of the customer-average RV computed in Appendices A and B to compute bounds on the distribution, e.g., using Chebyshev's inequality <ref> [Pap84] </ref>, of the customer average RV. 4.2 QOS criteria Here we consider the computation of the packet-group and connection-based QOS criterion. We first consider the packet-group-based criteria and then the customer-duration-based measure. <p> For other performance metrics, one could possibly utilize the statistics such as the mean and variance of the customer-average RV computed in the Appendices to compute bounds (e.g., using Chebyshev's inequality <ref> [Pap84] </ref>) on the distribution of the customer average RV. * Computation of statistics of the customer average when the QOS criteria is specified over a random group of arrivals such as a voice talkspurt or a video frame. 17 18 * Efficient schemes for computation of the proposed transient metrics are

Reference-contexts: The interval QOS has been proposed by organisations such as CCITT and CCIR for data and voice services [GL83, YW89, G.880] in the context of error performance of digital transmission systems. More recently, a proposal by the Internet Research Task Force <ref> [Par92] </ref> recommends an interval-based loss QOS criteria. Woodruff et al. [WK90] also suggest criteria such as the duration and occurrence of high loss periods. Ramaswamy and Willinger [RW90] and Bradlow [Bra90] propose that the packet delay in talkspurts for the ADPCM voice source be studied.

Reference-contexts: Then we consider the computation of the violation level for voice calls as a function of the offered load, connection duration, and loss QOS requirements. The model we assume for a voice source is a standard one (see, e.g., <ref> [DL86, HL86, SW86, N + 91] </ref>) and has as its basic premise that an active voice source periodically generates fixed length packets when a speaker is speaking (talkspurt) and otherwise remains idle. <p> We briefly describe this model here; the reader is referred to the above references, in particular <ref> [SW86] </ref>, for additional details and discussion. The voice packetization period is assumed to be fixed at T = 16 msec: and the talkspurt is assumed to contain a geometrically distributed number of packets, with mean 22 packets. The mean length of a talkspurt is thus ff 1 = 352 msec. <p> Given the above model, the interarrival times between packets generated by a single source form a renewal process. With probability 1=22; the interarrival time is 16 msec: and with probability 21=22; the interarrival time is 16 + X msec. <ref> [SW86] </ref>. The input traffic to the multiplexer is a superposition of a finite population of M voice sources, each of which is as characterized above. <p> A link utilization of 100% would then result from a superposition of approximately 136 voice sources. Also, in all of the results we assume a buffer size of 60 for the voice multiplexer. Owing to the considerable complexity of the analysis of the voice multiplexer <ref> [HL86, N + 91, SW86] </ref>, we resort to simulation. Before proceeding to the results, we make a few comments regarding our simulation. The simulation results obtained in this section are obtained by the method of independent replications with the transients discarded in each replication 4 .
