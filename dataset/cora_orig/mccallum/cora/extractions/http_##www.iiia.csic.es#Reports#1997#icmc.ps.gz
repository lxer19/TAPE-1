Abstract: We have studied the problem of generating expressive musical performances in the context of tenor saxophone interpretations. We have done several recordings of a tenor sax playing different Jazz ballads with different degrees of expressiveness including an inexpressive interpretation of each ballad. These recordings are analyzed, using SMS spectral modeling techniques, to extract information related to several expressive parameters. This set of parameters and the scores constitute the set of cases (examples) of a case-based system. From this set of cases, the system infers a set of possible expressive transformations for a given new phrase applying similarity criteria, based on background musical knowledge, between this new phrase and the set of cases. Finally, SaxEx applies the inferred expressive transformations to the new phrase using the synthesis capabilities of SMS.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We have developed SaxEx, a case-based reasoning system for generating expressive performances of melodies based on examples of human performances. Case-based Reasoning <ref> [1] </ref> (CBR) is a recent approach to problem solving and learning where new problems are solved using similar previously solved problems. <p> This sound analysis and synthesis system is ideal as a preprocessor for Saxex, giving to it high level musical parameters, and as a post-processor, adding the transformations specified by the case-based rea soning system to the original sound. 1.2 Case-Based Reasoning Case-based Reasoning [9] <ref> [1] </ref> (CBR) is a recent approach to problem solving and learning where a new problem is solved by finding a set of similar previously solved problems, called cases, and reusing them in the new problem situation.

Reference-contexts: The collection of problems that a system has solved is called the Episodic memory of Noos. The problems solved by Noos are accessible and retrievable. This introspection capability of Noos is the basic building block for integrating learning, and specifically case-based reasoning, into Noos. Noos also incorporates perspectives <ref> [2] </ref>, a mechanism to describe declarative biases for case retrieval in structured and complex representations of cases.

Reference-contexts: SaxEx incorporates background musical knowledge based on Narmour's implication/realization model [11] and Lerdahl and Jackendoff's generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) [10]. These theories of musical perception and musical understanding are the basis of the computational model of musical knowledge of the system. SaxEx is implemented in Noos [4] <ref> [3] </ref>, a reflective object-centered representation language designed to support knowledge modeling of problem solving and learning. 1.1 SMS SMS is a set of techniques for the analysis, transformation and synthesis of musical sounds.

Reference-contexts: Noos is based on feature terms [12]. Feature terms are record-like data structures embodying a collection of features. Figure 2 shows the representation of a score in Noos that is described in Section 2.1. Noos has been used to implement several applications such as chroma <ref> [5] </ref>, a system for recommending a plan for the purification of proteins from tissues and cultures, spin, a sponge identification system for a class of marine sponge species, and sham, a knowledge-based system for harmonizing catalan folk songs.

The analysis procedure detects partials by studying the time-varying spectral characteristics of a sound and represents them with time-varying sinu-soids.

These attributes can be modified and added back to the spectral representation without any loss of sound quality.
