Abstract: In this paper we describe a distributed and dynamic architecture for network management of a heterogeneous distributed system which we have implemented in order to perform network management of our local distributed system. The architecture is highly generic in nature and can be extended to a large heterogeneous network. The architecture is distributed in nature as it provides for multiple managers acting simultaneously. It is rendered dynamic by the utilization of mobile agents for the implementation of network management functionalities. The network managers in our architecture utilize client- server technology and/or mobile agent technology as and when required depending on the functionality implemented and their location. In this context we have implemented a Mobile Network Manager (MNM) which is a location independent network manager. Mobile agents are furnished by MAGENTA (Mobile AGENT environment for distributed Applications) which we have implemented for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: The prevalent network management architectures differ in the location and the amount of partitioning of the databases and the subdivision of the information gathering mechanisms amongst the NMSs. In this paper SNMP <ref> [1] </ref> is considered as the network management protocol for explaining in detail the network management functionalities as it is representative of network management protocols. The prevalent architectures of network management systems are depicted in Figure 2 and are described as follows: Centralized network management.

Reference-contexts: Most of the network management functionalities are in place. 4.1 Environment The architecture has been designed and implemented to manage the Astrolab distributed system <ref> [2] </ref>. The Astrolab distributed system comprises of a variety of machines running different operating systems like PCs (executing Win3.1, Win 95, Win NT, Linux, Net BSD), Sun Sparcs and AIX machines executing many variants of UNIX environment.

Reference-contexts: Mobile agents are autonomous programs which perform a goal-directed behaviour and have the capability of moving from one site to another, reacting to changes in the environment and interacting with the resources or other service/mobile agents at the sites <ref> [3] </ref>. Mobile agents can be utilized effectively for network management functionalities and for rendering the architecture distributed and dynamic. 3.2 Mobile Agents in Network Management? Mobile agents can be used for a variety of purposes in network management.

Reference-contexts: Latest trends in network management also has been towards decentralization and delegation <ref> [4] </ref>. An effort towards distribution and separation of GUI and applications from the information gathering part of a typical NMS has also been made [5][6]. Of late, mobile agent technology has generated lot of attention and has been applied in various domains.

Reference-contexts: The environment being heterogeneous in nature it was necessary to have a system independent manager. The managers have been thus written in Java which interacts with a server utilizing an infrastructure furnished by ISM/OpenMaster <ref> [7] </ref>. The managers, servers and SNMP agents utilize the MAGENTA environment which is also written in Java. For the implementation purposes Java was chosen because it is architecturally neutral. It is object oriented, dynamically extensible and provides facilities of Object Se--rialization which was used for implementing mobile agents.

Reference-contexts: In case of a wireless MNM as shown in Figure 6, as the manager moves from one cell to another, the mobile agents passes through the Mobile Service Station (MSS) of the previous cell and after completing its itinerary comes back through the new MSS of the new cell <ref> [8] </ref>. In case the MNM disconnects after sending the agent, the mobile agent waits at the last lieu in the itinerary for the MNM to connect back.
