Title: Computational Complexity of Learning Read-Once Formulas over Different Bases  
Author: Lisa Hellerstein Marek Karpinski 
Date: February, 1991  
Pubnum: TR-91-014  
Abstract: We study computational complexity of learning read-once formulas over different boolean bases. In particular we design a polynomial time algorithm for learning read-once formulas over a threshold basis. The algorithm works in time O(n 3 ) using O(n 3 ) membership queries. By the result of [Angluin, Heller-stein, Karpinski, 1989] on the corresponding unate class of boolean functions, this gives a polynomial time learning algorithm for arbitrary read-once formulas over a threshold basis with negation using membership and equivalence queries. Furthermore we study the structural notion of nondegeneracy in the threshold formulas generalizing the result of [Heiman, Newman, Wigderson, 1990] on the uniqueness of read-once formulas over different boolean bases and derive a negative result on learnability of nondegenerate read-once formulas over the basis (AND, XOR).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Read-once formulas are boolean formulas over the basis (AND, OR, NOT) in which each variable in the formula appears exactly once. Various papers in learning theory have considered the learnability of read-once formulas in different learning models <ref> [A 89] </ref>, [AHK 89], [HK 89]. Functions expressible by read-once formulas have been shown to have many interesting combinatorial properties [KLNSW 88]. In this paper, we prove some results about classes of read-once formulas over bases other than (AND, OR, NOT).

Various papers in learning theory have considered the learnability of read-once formulas in different learning models [A 89], <ref> [AHK 89] </ref>, [HK 89]. Functions expressible by read-once formulas have been shown to have many interesting combinatorial properties [KLNSW 88]. In this paper, we prove some results about classes of read-once formulas over bases other than (AND, OR, NOT). Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski [AHK 89] showed that read-once formulas over the <p> formulas in different learning models [A 89], <ref> [AHK 89] </ref>, [HK 89]. Functions expressible by read-once formulas have been shown to have many interesting combinatorial properties [KLNSW 88]. In this paper, we prove some results about classes of read-once formulas over bases other than (AND, OR, NOT). Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski [AHK 89] showed that read-once formulas over the basis (AND, OR) can be exactly learned in polynomial time using membership queries. <p> In this paper, we extend the result by showing that read-once formulas over a threshold basis (which we call ROTB formulas) can be learned exactly in polynomial time using membership queries. By the results of Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski <ref> [AHK 89] </ref>, it follows that the corresponding unate class (which includes the class of read-once formulas) can be learned exactly in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries. 3 Heiman, Newman, and Wigderson proved in [HNW 90] that each distinct, nondegenerate, ROTB formula expresses a unique function. <p> Proof: The class of formulas mentioned in this theorem is the unate extension of the class of ROTB formulas. The theorem follows directly from the results of Angluin, Hellerstein and Karpinski <ref> [AHK 89] </ref>, who showed that if a class M can be learned in time O (n k ) with O (n j ) membership queries, then the corresponding unate class can be learned in time O (n k+1 ) with O (n j+1 ) membership queries, and O (n) equivalence queries.

Reference-contexts: By the results of Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski [AHK 89], it follows that the corresponding unate class (which includes the class of read-once formulas) can be learned exactly in polynomial time using membership and equivalence queries. 3 Heiman, Newman, and Wigderson proved in <ref> [HNW 90] </ref> that each distinct, nondegenerate, ROTB formula expresses a unique function. Two formulas are distinct if they are not tree-isomorphic. <p> We prove that a formula over such a basis is degenerate iff it contains either two ORs, two ANDs, two XORs in adjacent positions along a root-leaf path. (Therefore, our definition of degeneracy includes the definition of Heiman, Newman, and Wigderson <ref> [HNW 90] </ref>.) We end by proving that if B is a basis satisfying the above four properties, then each distinct non-degenerate read-once formula over B expresses a unique function. 2 Preliminaries The variable set V n is defined to be fX 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X
