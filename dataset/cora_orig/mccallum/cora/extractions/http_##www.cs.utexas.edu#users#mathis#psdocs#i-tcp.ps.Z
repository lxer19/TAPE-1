Abstract: IP-based solutions to accommodate mobile hosts within existing internetworks do not address the distinctive features of wireless mobile computing. IP-based transport protocols thus suffer from poor performance when a mobile host communicates with a host on the fixed network. This is caused by frequent disruptions in network layer connectivity due to i) mobility and ii) unreliable nature of the wireless link. We describe the design and implementation of I-TCP, which is an indirect transport layer protocol for mobile hosts. I-TCP utilizes the resources of Mobility Support Routers (MSRs) to provide transport layer communication between mobile hosts and hosts on the fixed network. With I-TCP, the problems related to mobility and the unreliability of wireless link are handled entirely within the wireless link; the TCP/IP software on the fixed hosts is not modified. Using I-TCP on our testbed, the throughput between a fixed host and a mobile host improved substantially in comparison to regular TCP.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, use of a new protocol stack for mobile hosts causes interoperability problems. An Indirect model for mobile hosts <ref> [4] </ref> allows the development and use of specialized transport protocols that address the performance issues on the comparatively low bandwidth and unreliable wireless link. Protocols developed based on this model can also mitigate the effects of disconnections and moves while maintaining interoperability with existing protocols. <p> We begin with a brief description of the Indirect Protocol model <ref> [4] </ref> on which indirect TCP is based. 3.1 Indirect Model for Mobile Hosts The indirect protocol model for mobile hosts suggests that any interaction from a mobile host (MH) to a machine on the fixed network (FH) should be split into two separate interactions one between the MH and its mobile

Reference-contexts: to bring 2 their error rate on par with that on the wired networks but such an approach interferes with the end-to-end retransmissions of TCP and does not always result in improved performance [6]. 2.2 TCP/IP in Mobile Environment Mobility can give rise to severe performance problems in TCP throughput <ref> [5] </ref>. The main reasons for throughput degradation is the loss of TCP segments during cell crossovers especially with non-overlapped cells. <p> Lost segments trigger exponential back off and congestion control at the transmitting host and the congestion recovery phase may last for several seconds even after network layer communication is reestablished in the new wireless cell. Fast retransmission coupled with modification of the TCP software on the mobile hosts <ref> [5] </ref> solves only part of the problem because the transmitting host still performs a slow start if more than one segment is lost per window, thus limiting the effective throughput [12]. <p> Our experiments were inspired by similar experiments reported by Caceres and Iftode <ref> [5] </ref> to study the effect of mobility on reliable transport protocols. Tables 1 and 2 compare the end-to-end throughput of an I-TCP connection between an MH and a fixed host (FH) with that of a direct TCP connection for local area and wide area connections respectively.
