Title: Mathematics the Pure Science?  
Author: Robin Hirsch 
Date: December 1, 1995  
Abstract: The philosophy of mathematics provides a severe test for a materialist explanation of science. This is because mathematics is mostly abstract and mathematical theory is rarely tested directly in practice. All the main schools of the philosophy of mathematics | platonism, logicism, intuitionism, formalism | are varieties of idealism. Nevertheless all human ideas, including mathematical ideas, originate from our experience of the world and are rooted in reality. In the history of mathematics it can be seen that problems facing society have given a great impetus to the development of the subject. Thus the rise of trade and changes in technology have each led to great advances, though purely internal contradictions within mathematics have also been of considerable importance. Formal mathematical reasoning, like classical logic, has been highly successful in the evolution of science but is inadequate for reasoning about indeterministic processes in a state of change. Thus formal logic and dialectics should be thought of as complementary and both are required for a fully scientific understanding of the world.

Reference-contexts: Suffice it to say that the foundations were no longer considered to be quite so solid. It is perhaps worth adding that as far as formal logic is concerned it is possible to reconstruct a Platonist framework for mathematics while avoiding the contradictions <ref> [2] </ref>. It is rather like the struggle between the Ptolomeic and the Galilean view of the solar system. Given enough cycles and epi-cycles the Ptolomeic system could explain everything that the Galilean system could.

Reference-contexts: Frege wrote The firmest method of proof is obviously the purely logical one, which, disregarding the particular characteristics of things, is based solely upon the laws on which all knowledge rests. (Preface to <ref> [5] </ref> page 103) He then continues, in the same article, to attempt to demonstrate that arithmetic and probably geometry, differential and integral calculus can be handled by this very rigorous method of deduction.

Reference-contexts: We should have to speak of my two and your two, of one two and all twos. ...and in the course of millennia these might evolve, for all we could tell, to such a pitch that two of them would make five. <ref> [6] </ref> 8 We can now counter-pose two views.

Reference-contexts: Frege appeared to be unaware of this consequence of his work, or afraid to make it explicit.) Frege started a project, the 2 For a good debate as to whether revolutions are possible in mathematics read <ref> [8] </ref>. 5 so-called Logicist project which attempted to eliminate all the unjustifiable assumptions in mathematics and to reduce it to pure logic. Here any theorem in mathematics was to be proved using the simple rules of logic from axioms that were self evident truths.

Reference-contexts: In the twentieth century Platonists have had to modify their ideas to some extent but still Carl Hempel argues that the basic formulas of mathematics and logic are `true a priori, which is to indicate that their truth is logically independent of, or logically prior to, any experiential evidence' <ref> [9] </ref>. Or read [17] which includes, among many fascinating insights, an orthodox exposition of the Platonist case. Marxists might classify Platonism as a form of objective idealism : concepts and ideas (like numbers) are given an objective reality separate from human thought.

Reference-contexts: It seems the interplay between theoretic and practical considerations typical in mathematics, is more subtle that either of the two cited books acknowledges.

Reference-contexts: One final point to add: it is not just the history of mathematics that proceeds dialectically, even the content can be conceived in this way. In a brilliant essay <ref> [15] </ref> Lakatos shows that even the process of mathematical proof is an evolving and dialectic one. The mathematical proof of a particular result is shown to have an evolution caused by the tension between the rational deduction (proof) and the counter-example both of which can exist simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Here mathematics is not viewed as a purely objective reflection of the world nor as a purely subjective human construction but it is produced by a dialectic interaction between the material world and human conciousness: mathematics is based on human experience.

Reference-contexts: What neural process, after all, could be described as the perception of a mathematical object? <ref> [18] </ref> Platonism received its first major set-back from one of its arch proponents: Plato's predecessor Pythagoras [6'th century BC].

(Incidentally, this philosophical problem about non-standard interpretations of the axioms has been put to good use in the subject known as Non-Standard Analysis which uses models containing, as well as all the ordinary real numbers, infinitely large and infinitesimally small numbers.

Reference-contexts: Geometry also, to a lesser extent, provided one of the foundations of objective truth. At around the time of Pythagoras, there was the discovery of irrational numbers. (There is some doubt as to whether it was Pythagoras who actually made this discovery. See <ref> [20] </ref>.) An irrational number, like p 2 or , cannot be written as a fraction. Though 22 7 is a good approximation, it can be shown that no fraction can be exactly equal to .
