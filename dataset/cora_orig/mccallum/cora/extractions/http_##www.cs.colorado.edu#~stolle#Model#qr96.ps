Abstract: Modeling is the process of constructing a model of a target system that is suitable for a given task. Typically, in the hierarchy from more-abstract to less-abstract models, the model of choice is the one that is just detailed enough to account for the properties and perspectives of interest for the task at hand. The main goal of the work described here was to design and implement a knowledge representation framework that allows a computer program to reason about physical systems and candidate models (ordinary differential equations, specifically) in such a way as to find the right model at the right abstraction level as quickly as possible. A key observation about the modeling process is the following. Not only is the resulting model the least complex of all possible ones, but also the reasoning during model construction takes place at the highest possible level at any time. Because of this, the knowledge representation framework was designed to allow easy formulation of knowledge and meta knowledge relative to various abstraction levels. Candidate models are constructed via simple, powerful domain rules. The customized knowledge representation framework is then used to generate new knowledge about the physical system and new knowledge about the candidate model. A candidate model is valid if the facts about the system that is to be modeled are consistent with the facts about the candidate model. Any inconsistency is a reason to discard the candidate model.

Using reasons for failure to improve the model is called discrepancy-driven refinement.

Reference-contexts: We describe the basic paradigm of the reasoning framework used in this "model checker" and discuss how this framework can be expanded to incorporate additional reasoning mechanisms. The next section outlines the major features of the modeling program Pret. For a more elaborate discussion consult <ref> (Bradley & Stolle 1996) </ref>. Then we describe how the paradigm "valid if not proven invalid" is able to combine several heterogeneous mechanisms into a powerful framework that is well suited for reasoning about models of physical systems.

Reference-contexts: i = 0 conservative r f = 0 damped oscillation and autonomous r f &lt; 0 growing oscillation and autonomous r f &gt; 0 achieve this behavior, Pret preprocesses the observations | curve fitting, recognition of linear regions, and so on | using Maple functions and simple phase-portrait analysis techniques <ref> (Bradley 1995) </ref>, both of which yield high-level results that can then be used much as qualitative observations. The next section describes, in more detail, the paradigm that underlies the reasoning framework that is used to check candidate models against observations.

Reference-contexts: In this abstraction hierarchy, ODE rules that concern numeric information are considered "concrete" whereas ODE rules that deal with qualitative information are considered "abstract." We are working on an intermediate level that uses constraint logic programming techniques <ref> (Cohen 1990) </ref> in order to reason about ranges (instead of symbols or single numbers). For example, if a physical system oscillates, the imaginary parts of at least one pair of its roots must be nonzero.

The collection of Scheme "model observer" functions that identifies mathematical properties of the current candidate model essentially implements the basic operations found in any mathematics text; some representative examples are shown in Figure 3. Mathematical properties of both the model and the physical system are represented declaratively. <p> The spectrum ranges from models and tools that use a language that is very close to the physics of the system (e.g., QPT/QPE (Forbus 1984; 1990)) to models that use a language that is well suited to describe the system mathematically (e.g., ODEs). QSIM <ref> (Kuipers 1986) </ref> is a qualitative realization of the mathematics end of this spectrum. Pret resides somewhere in the middle. Its inputs are partially expressed in terms of physics and its reasoning uses concepts from physics.
