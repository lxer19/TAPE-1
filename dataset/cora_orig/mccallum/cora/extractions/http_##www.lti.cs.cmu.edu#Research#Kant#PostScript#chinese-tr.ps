Title: Chinese Sentence Generation in a Knowledge-Based Machine Translation System

Abstract: This paper presents a technique for generating Chinese sentences from the Interlingua expressions used in the KANT knowledge-based machine translation system. Chinese sentences are generated directly from the semantic representation using a unification-based generation formalization which takes advantage of certain linguistic features of Chinese. Direct generation from the semantic form eliminates the need for an intermediate syntactic structure, thus simplifying the generation procedure. The generation algorithm is top-down, data-driven and recursive. The descriptive nature of the pseudo-unification grammar formalism used in KANT allows the grammar developer to write very straightforward semantic grammar rules. We also discuss some of the crucial problems in Chinese language generation, and describe how they can be dealt with in our framework. This technique has been implemented in a prototype Chinese sentence generation system for KANT. Some implementation details and experimental results concerning the prototype are presented at the end of this paper.

Reference-contexts: Based on this observation, we adopt a sentential semantic representation based on concept frames as the basis for the sentence generation, instead of more typical syntactic structures. We map the semantic structures directly into linear structures (sentences) without first converting them into f-structures as in a typical KBMT application <ref> (Goodman and Nirenburg, 1991) </ref>. This technique allows us to construct a semantic grammar which models the direct relationship between semantic predicate-argument relations and the linear realization of the sentence. 3. Generation From Semantic Frames The input to the generation module varies greatly from system to system. <p> Non-propositional meaning can be realized with the help of lexical items, word order or selection of specific syntactic structures. The lexical selection process, especially with respect to open-class lexeme selection, is one of the most important tasks in machine translation <ref> (Goodman and Nirenburg, 1991) </ref>. We give only a brief description of lexical selection here; for more details on lexical selection in KANT, see (Mitamura, et al., 1991; Nyberg, et al., 1989). The basic means by which lexical selection is performed is via thematic-role subcategorization.

Reference-contexts: First of all, Chinese does not manifest a high degree of morphological complexity in term of types of grammatical morphemes when compared to other languages. Hence it is characterized as an isolating language <ref> (Li and Thompson, 1982) </ref>.
