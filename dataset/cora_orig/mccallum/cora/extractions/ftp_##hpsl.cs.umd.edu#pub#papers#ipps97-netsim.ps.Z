Abstract: We present a customizable simulator called netsim for high-performance point-to-point workstation networks that is accurate enough to be used for application-level performance analysis yet is easy enough to customize for multiple architectures and software configurations. Customization is accomplished without using any proprietary information, using only publicly available hardware specifications and information that can be readily determined using a suite of test programs. We customized netsim for two platforms: a 16-node IBM SP-2 with a multistage network and a 10-node DEC Alpha Farm with an ATM switch. We show that netsim successfully models these two architectures with a 2-6% error on the SP-2 and less than 10% error on the Alpha Farm for most test cases. It achieves this accuracy at the cost of a 7-36 fold simulation slowdown with respect to the SP-2 and a 3-8 fold slowdown with respect to the Alpha Farm.

Even though it is more convenient to use analytical models for the analysis, it is very difficult to obtain accurate models for complex systems.

Reference-contexts: Most contemporary commercial and research parallel platforms fall into this category (e.g. the IBM SP-2, the DEC Alpha Farm, the Berkeley NOW <ref> [3] </ref>, the CESDIS Beowulf [15]).

Reference-contexts: The results indicate that netsim achieves its accuracy at the cost of a 7-36 fold slowdown for the SP-2 and a 3-8 fold slowdown for the Alpha Farm. To place this result in context, Benveniste and Heidelberger <ref> [4] </ref> report that a detailed simulator takes 1 day on a workstation to simulate 1 second of simulation time for a 128 node SP-2 configuration. <p> We resort to simulation as modeling a full workstation cluster, including network and I/O subsystems and their associated software, is a daunting task. Other simulation models for network interconnects have been built at various levels of detail, accuracy and speed <ref> [4, 5, 11] </ref>. All these simulators are specific to a single architecture and perform detailed hardware simulation. Netsim differs from these simulators in that it is a high-level simulator and that it models both the hardware and the software.

Reference-contexts: There is a convergence in design of both the interconnects used for workstation networks and the messaging software used on these networks. Modern workstation network interconnects are designed using switching elements and point-to-point links with a regular, low-dimension topology and aggressive cut-through routing and flow-control <ref> [6, 16] </ref>. Data rates are high and the error rates are low. Communication is either packet-based, with an upper bound on the packet size, or cell-based with a fixed packet size.

Reference-contexts: A case study using IBM SP2 to evaulate the netsim is presented in section 3. Finally, we present our conclusions after a brief discussion on the related literature in section 4. Due to space constraints, please refer to <ref> [12] </ref> for the case study on the Alpha Farm and other details. 2. Description of The Simulator Netsim models point-to-point interconnection links, network adapters with an outboard buffer and a DMA engine, and buffered communication software. <p> We conducted a series of experiments on various SP-2 and Alpha Farm configurations to determine the impact of network congestion on application performance. We found that for high-performance point-to-point networks cross-traffic congestion contributes little to application-level performance (see <ref> [12] </ref> for details). Network adapters in netsim are modeled as bidirectional, dual-ported devices with an outboard buffer. The DMA port of a network adapter is used to copy network packets between the processor and the network adapter, and the network port is used for communicating with other network adapters. <p> We presented a customization case study using a 16-node SP-2 with a multistage switch. We also customized netsim for a 10-node four processor Alpha workstation farm <ref> [12] </ref>. We evaluated the customized versions of netsim using a suite of low-level network microbenchmarks commonly used for building higher levels of networking software.

Reference-contexts: The bisection bandwidth of this network scales linearly with the number of processors. In this study, we used a 16-node SP-2 running AIX 3.2.5. All the nodes in this machine are the so-called thin nodes. We obtained the hardware parameters for the IBM SP-2 from [16] and <ref> [13] </ref>. Figure 1 shows the results of the test programs for IBM SP-2. Note that the packetization and reassembly costs are quite close to each other. <p> For small messages, MPL makes two copies, one from user buffer to system buffer (called the pipe input buffer), and the other from the system buffer to virtual switch interface which contains the pinned pages for the DMA interface <ref> [13] </ref>. In order to obtain the costs of packetization, we subtract the cost of two copies (2 s) from the mean per packet overhead to arrive at 3s.

Reference-contexts: Many network adapters provide outboard buffering where the adapter buffers are large enough to function as retransmit and receive buffers. DMA is almost universally supported for transfers between host memory and adapter buffer.
