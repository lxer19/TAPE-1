Abstract: Acyclic digraphs, such as the covering digraphs of ordered sets, are usually drawn upward, i.e., with the edges monotonically increasing in the vertical direction. A digraph is upward planar if it admits an upward planar drawing. In this survey paper, we overview the literature on the problem of upward planarity testing. We present several characterizations of upward planarity and describe upward planarity testing algorithms for special classes of digraphs, such as embedded digraphs and single-source digraphs. We also sketch the proof of NP-completeness of upward planarity testing.

Reference-contexts: Tree T does not contain any internal vertex of ~ G and is rooted at the external face h. The example of Fig. 7 is an illustration of the following theorem. Theorem 4 <ref> [5] </ref> Let ~ G be an embedded single-source digraph, and h a face of ~ G. <p> Theorem 4 yields the following algorithm for testing the upward planarity of an embedded single-source digraph ~ G <ref> [5] </ref>. 1. Test whether ~ G is acyclic and bimodal. If either of these properties is not verified, return "not upward planar". 2. Construct the face-sink graph F of ~ G (see Section 3.4). 3. Check Conditions 2 and 3 of Theorem 4. <p> If this set is empty, then return "not upward planar" else return "upward planar". The above algorithm can be easily implemented in O (n) time. Theorem 14 <ref> [5] </ref> Let ~ G be an embedded single-source digraph with n vertices. We can test whether ~ G is upward planar in O (n) time. <p> G is not upward planar (for any choice of the external face). 4.4 Single-Source Digraphs In this section we present a decomposition strategy for testing the upward planarity of single-source digraphs, which was originally proposed by Hutton and Lubiw [20], and later improved by Bertolazzi, Di Battista, Mannino, and Tamassia <ref> [5] </ref>. To start with, it is easy to prove that the biconnected components of a single-source digraph can be separately tested. Lemma 4 [20] A connected single-source digraph ~ G is upward planar if and only all the biconnected components of ~ G are upward planar. <p> Hutton and Lubiw [20] present an O (n 2 )-time upward planarity testing algorithm for single-source digraphs, based on the above decomposition strategy. Bertolazzi, Di Battista, 14 Mannino, and Tamassia <ref> [5] </ref> reduce the time complexity to O (n) by combining a linear-time algorithm for triconnected single source-digraphs (Theorem 14) with an improved decomposition strategy, which is outlined below. The SPQR-tree [14] T (G) of a biconnected graph (or digraph) G describes the arrangement of its triconnected components (see Fig. 13). <p> A Q-node corresponds to an edge of G, and its skeleton consists of two parallel edges. Note that the edge directions are ignored in the definition of SPQR-tree. The upward planarity testing algorithm of <ref> [5] </ref> first replaces each edge of the skeletons by a gadget (playing the same role as the marker of [20]), which is either a directed edge or a peak (see Fig. 15), and tests each augmented skeleton for upward planarity, marking those gadgets that can appear on the external face in <p> This is not possible, as it can be shown by applying Theorem 14. We conclude that the single-source digraph of Fig 13 (a) is not upward planar. Theorem 15 <ref> [5] </ref> Let ~ G be a single-source digraph with n vertices. We can test whether ~ G is upward planar in O (n) time. 4.5 Outerplanar Digraphs Papakostas [24] has recently shown that upward planarity testing can be efficiently performed for outerplanar digraphs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Planarity is a fundamental property in graph visualization applications, and a substantial effort has been devoted to the design of efficient algorithms for testing planarity and for constructing planar drawings (see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). When considering acyclic digraphs, such as the covering digraphs of ordered sets, the notion of planarity needs to be refined to take into account the fact that such digraphs are usually drawn upward, i.e., with the edges monotonically increasing in the vertical direction.

Reference-contexts: Some of these characterizations yield efficient upward planarity testing algorithms, as shown in Section 4. 3.1 Inclusion in a Planar st-Digraph A simple characterization of upward planarity was independently discovered by Di Battista and Tamassia <ref> [13] </ref> and by Kelly [21]. We need the following definition: a planar st-digraph 2 is planar acyclic digraph with a single source, denoted s, a single sink, denoted t, and the edge (s; t). <p> We need the following definition: a planar st-digraph 2 is planar acyclic digraph with a single source, denoted s, a single sink, denoted t, and the edge (s; t). Theorem 1 <ref> [13, 21] </ref> A digraph ~ G is upward planar if and only it is a spanning subgraph of a planar st-digraph (i.e., edges can be added to ~ G such that the resulting digraph ~ H is a planar st-digraph).

Reference-contexts: Bertolazzi, Di Battista, 14 Mannino, and Tamassia [5] reduce the time complexity to O (n) by combining a linear-time algorithm for triconnected single source-digraphs (Theorem 14) with an improved decomposition strategy, which is outlined below. The SPQR-tree <ref> [14] </ref> T (G) of a biconnected graph (or digraph) G describes the arrangement of its triconnected components (see Fig. 13). T (G) is an unrooted tree whose nodes are of four types: S, P, Q, and R.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 also implies that if a digraph admits an upward planar drawing, then it also admits an upward planar straight-line drawing. While the latter drawings are highly desirable for their simplicity, their area requirement may be prohibitive for visualization applications. Namely, Di Battista, Tamassia, and Tollis <ref> [15] </ref> show that there exists a family ~ G n of upward planar digraphs such that ~ G n has 2n + 2 vertices, and any planar straight-line upward drawing of ~ G n has area (2 n ).

Reference-contexts: By the end of 1993, upward planarity testing algorithms were known only for specific subclasses of digraphs, such as embedded and single-source digraphs, when the authors came up with a proof that the problem of testing whether a digraph is upward planar is NP-complete <ref> [17] </ref>. It is interesting to observe that while testing whether a graph admits a planar drawing or an upward drawing can be done in linear time, combining the two properties makes the problem NP-hard.

We assume standard concepts and definitions on NP-completeness [16]. <p> We shall consider transformations where a directed edge (u; v) of a digraph is replaced with a tendril T k , where the source is identified with u and the sink with t.

Each fragment edge inherits the capacity range of the originating clause edge. Using Lemma 6, we obtain the main result of this section. Theorem 18 <ref> [17] </ref> Given an instance S of not-all-equal-3-sat with n variables and m clauses, the associated planar switch-flow network P has O (n 2 m 2 ) vertices and edges, and can be constructed in O (n 2 m 2 ) time. <p> We construct the dual digraph ~ D of ~ P by orienting every dual edge of D from the face on the left to the face on the right of the primal edge (see Fig. 18). Lemma 7 <ref> [17] </ref> The dual digraph ~ D of ~ P is upward planar, triconnected, acyclic and has exactly one source and one sink, denoted with s and t. <p> The remaining vertices of ~ G are called secondary vertices. By Lemma 7 and the construction of digraph ~ G, all the embeddings of ~ G are obtained by choosing one of the two possible flips for each tendril. Lemma 8 <ref> [17] </ref> Digraph ~ G is upward planar if and only if the tendrils can be flipped and the wiggles can be arranged such that for every face the total contribution of the tendrils and wiggles is zero.

Reference-contexts: By Lemma 4, we restrict our attention to a biconnected single-source digraph ~ G. The basic idea is to decompose ~ G into its triconnected components <ref> [18] </ref> and test each of them separately for upward planarity, with certain constraints imposed on them to ensure that merging back together the triconnected components preserves upward planarity. Recall that the upward planarity of a triconnected digraph can be efficiently tested (Theorems 13 and 14).

Theorem 4 yields the following algorithm for testing the upward planarity of an embedded single-source digraph ~ G [5]. 1. <p> embedded digraph ~ G of Fig. 8, we conclude that ~ G is not upward planar (for any choice of the external face). 4.4 Single-Source Digraphs In this section we present a decomposition strategy for testing the upward planarity of single-source digraphs, which was originally proposed by Hutton and Lubiw <ref> [20] </ref>, and later improved by Bertolazzi, Di Battista, Mannino, and Tamassia [5].

Lemma 4 [20] A connected single-source digraph ~ G is upward planar if and only all the biconnected components of ~ G are upward planar. By Lemma 4, we restrict our attention to a biconnected single-source digraph ~ G. <p> Hence, we should keep track in the decomposition process of vertices that are constrained to appear on the external face. Hutton and Lubiw <ref> [20] </ref> present an O (n 2 )-time upward planarity testing algorithm for single-source digraphs, based on the above decomposition strategy. <p> Note that the edge directions are ignored in the definition of SPQR-tree. The upward planarity testing algorithm of [5] first replaces each edge of the skeletons by a gadget (playing the same role as the marker of <ref> [20] </ref>), which is either a directed edge or a peak (see Fig. 15), and tests each augmented skeleton for upward planarity, marking those gadgets that can appear on the external face in a planar upward drawing.

Reference-contexts: Besides their applications to ordered sets, testing upward planarity and constructing upward planar drawings of digraphs are important for displaying hierarchical structures, such as subroutine-call graphs, is-a hierarchies, and PERT networks. While planarity testing can be done in linear time <ref> [19, 23, 8, 10] </ref>, the complexity of upward planarity testing has been until recently an open problem. 3 Characterizing Upward Planarity In this section we overview the known combinatorial characterizations of upward planarity, which make use of a variety of topological and geometric constructions. <p> Theorem 7 [25] A lattice is planar if and only if the undirected graph obtained from its covering digraph by ignoring the orientation of the edges and adding an edge between the source and sink is planar. 9 Lempel, Even, and Cederbaum <ref> [23] </ref> relate the planarity of biconnected undirected graphs to the upward planarity of acyclic digraphs with one source and one sink. <p> An st-orientation of an undirected graph G is an acyclic digraph with exactly one source s and one sink t, joined by an edge, which is obtained from G by orienting its edges. A biconnected graph admits an st-orientation for any edge (s; t). Theorem 8 <ref> [23] </ref> Let G be a biconnected graph, and ~ G be an st-orientation of G. We have that G is planar if and only if ~ G is upward planar. The planarity of lattices is also characterized by the (order) dimension.

Reference-contexts: The study of upward planarity has been especially active in the last two decades, and has revealed fascinating connections with fundamental graph- and order-theoretic properties such as connectivity and dimension (see, e.g., <ref> [26] </ref>). By the end of 1993, upward planarity testing algorithms were known only for specific subclasses of digraphs, such as embedded and single-source digraphs, when the authors came up with a proof that the problem of testing whether a digraph is upward planar is NP-complete [17]. <p> Hence, Theorem 1 yields an exponential-time (albeit linear-space) upward planarity testing algorithm, which consists of adding all the possible subsets of at most 3n 6 edges, and testing whether each of the resulting digraphs is a planar st-digraph. Theorem 11 Upward planarity testing is in NP. See <ref> [26] </ref> for an alternative proof of Theorem 11. 10 4.2 Embedded Digraphs In this section we present the algorithm by Bertolazzi, Di Battista, Liotta and Mannino [3, 4] for testing whether an embedded digraph is upward planar. The algorithm is based on the characterization of Theorem 2.
