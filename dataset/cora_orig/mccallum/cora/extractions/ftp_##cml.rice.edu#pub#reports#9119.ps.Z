Abstract: This formula makes transparent exactly what happens in a recursive computation of the correlation functions. At every stage i, we have the Z-transform at points M i n of the appropriate function. In going to the (i + 1)st stage, the first term M i1 (z M ) ensures that values at the previous stage are retained at the even points, while the second term interpolates new values at the between points. This computation scheme is essentially the same as the wavelet-based lowpass/bandpass interpolation scheme in [5]. where x stands for some non-zero number. Again for any of the cross-correlations H l;m , the first N 1 points in the sequence M 1 (z) can be visualized as in Eqn. 42. Now let us assume that this is true for all M i (z), i = 1; 2; : : : ; J . We then show that it is true for M J+1 (z), prov against M J (z M ) shows that the result is true for M J+1 (z). M zeros that correspond to zeros of l etc., at a spacing of M J+1 . It turns out that all these zeros are new, in the sense that they do not correspond zeros at stage J 1 and therefore we have Eqn. 37 for all the positive zeros at the M -adics. K i = M i1 (K 1 + 2N M 1) (2N 1 M ): (45) Now each each of the sequences A 0;k , is approximately 2N=M points long, and since there are (M 1) of them, the computational complexity at stage i, is roughly 2N K i1 8N 2 M J2 4N 2 5. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied the correlation structures of the scaling function and wavelets associated with a multiplicity M , compactly supported, wavelet tight frames. We show how to efficiently compute the correlation functions approximately at the M -adic rationals. Furthermore, when the tight frame is, in particular, an orthonormal wavelet basis, we show that the approximations involved in the computation of the samples of the correlations cancel in a manner to make the computations exact. For the case of orthonormal wavelet bases, we also try to give a complete description of the zeros at the M -adic rationals. An interesting fact that [3] R. A. Gopinath and C. S. Burrus.
