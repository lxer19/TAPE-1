Abstract: This paper examines the representation of background knowledge and its use in case-based reasoning. Case-based reasoning can be viewed as a particular form of problem-solving, based on the assessment of similarity of a new case to previously encountered cases, and the subsequent inference that an old solution also applies to the new case. To justify such inferences, we present a representation of background knowledge as arguments for and against a conclusion given known facts, rather than as statements in logic or probabilistic relations. Cases are characterized by the set of arguments for and against a hypothesis of interest, and the resolution of conflicting arguments for a new case is obtained by firstly locating an old case where the same or a similar conflict occurred, then secondly transferring the resolution from the old case to the new case. In this way, we are able both to represent weak, possibly conflicting fragments of background knowledge and also learn about the relative strengths of such arguments from cases where the outcome of conflicting arguments is known. We provide a description of this method in logical form, and analyze the assumptions under which it is valid, its limitations and possible future extensions.

Reference-contexts: Interactions between features are not representable (features are assumed independent), resulting in a highly limited ability to model the domain. In addition, the selection of appropriate weight-ings on attributes is a notoriously difficult task. The Pro-tos system <ref> [Bareiss et al., 1987] </ref> has attempted to overcome some of these deficiencies by measuring relevance on the basis of a (numeric) assessment of user-supplied explanations of how features relate to a conclusion.

Reference-contexts: thus to: * Define what is meant by an argument, and how argu ments are used * Model how previous cases can be used in conjunction with arguments to solve new problems * Avoid the use of numerical measures of probability or belief, deemed unintuitive and problematic by many (see <ref> [Cheeseman, 1988] </ref> and subsequent debate for an excellent discussion) This last aim is particularly important, as it distinguishes this work from other attempts to handle uncertainty with numerical approaches.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, background knowledge alone should not be able to conclude Q (T) if the use of previous cases in reasoning is to be non-redundant (the non-redundancy problem <ref> [Davies and Russell, 1987] </ref>). <p> This allows a more knowledge-based assessment of relevance, but at the price of requiring more numerical parameters to be specified for the system to function. Davies and Russell <ref> [Davies and Russell, 1987] </ref> proposed a weaker form of representation of domain knowledge called determinations. <p> G a G 6= fg ) Stronger (a G ; fg) (4) and that the relation is antisymmetric: 8a G ; a :G Stronger (a G ; a :G ) , :Stronger (a :G ; a G ) 2 This can be expressed using Davies and Russell's notation for determinations <ref> [Davies and Russell, 1987] </ref> as: Args (a G ; "G (&lt;x &gt;)") ^ Args (a :G ; ":G (&lt;x i being a polar variable representing the truth value of G (x 3 ie. <p> Further research is needed to extend this formalism in this way. Finally, it should be noted that in this formalism we are making the same assumptions as Davies and Russell in their theory of determinations <ref> [Davies and Russell, 1987] </ref>, and that the method presented here can be viewed as an extension of this work.

Reference-contexts: For example, Gentner has argued that when the similarity P is solely some `abstract relational structure' then this process is one of analogy <ref> [Gentner, 1988] </ref>. We merely note that the processes of case-based reasoning and analogy are closely related. An important property of case-based reasoning is that neither the previous case nor the background knowledge alone is sufficient to infer the conclusions reached.

Reference-contexts: One method of representing the relevance of a feature to a concluded fact is to use some numerical measure or weight on each feature (eg. <ref> [Kibler and Aha, 1987] </ref>), and the relevance of an old case to a new is found by summing the weights on the features they have in common.
