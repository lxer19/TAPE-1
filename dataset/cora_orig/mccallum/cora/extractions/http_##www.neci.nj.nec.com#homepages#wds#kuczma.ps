Abstract: Consider a rooted tree with branching factor b &gt; 1 having b h leafs, each at distance h from the root. Suppose the leafs are assigned real values chosen i.i.d. from some probability density, and the interior nodes of the tree are then also assigned values recursively, according to the negamax rule: The value of a node is the maximum of the negated values of its children. We find a closed form for h (x). It then turns out that (usually) the behavior of the distribution at the root, when h becomes sufficiently large, is, except for scaling, asymptotically independent of the nature of 0 (x) and h and depends only on b. The function merely scales self-similarly as h becomes larger. This may be thought of as a new kind of central limit theorem.

(The fact that the polynomial equation has a unique root in [0; 1] is obvious since the left hand side is continuously decreasing from 1 to 0 and the right hand side is continuously increasing from 0 to 1.)

If b &gt; 1 and 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, then V 0 (x) = 1 (1 x) b &gt; 0 (83) so V (x) is a strictly increasing self-mapping of the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Similarly W (x) is a strictly increasing self mapping of the interval (1; 0]. Next, if b &gt; 1 and x &lt; 0, then W 00 (x) &lt; 0. <p> When we adopt this procedure with the particular increasing function T (z) = (1 [1 z] b ) b = ~ + s 2 (z ~)+ 2 (1~) 4 (z ~) 2 + O ([z ~] 3 ) on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, where 0, ~ = b (0), and 1 are the fixed points of T (z) in this interval and b &gt; 1, what happens? (Note: b here has nothing to do with b from the definition of M (z).) We immediately find (because T 0 (0) = T 0 <p> of T (z) in this interval and b &gt; 1, what happens? (Note: b here has nothing to do with b from the definition of M (z).) We immediately find (because T 0 (0) = T 0 (1) = 0) that it is impossible to upper bound T (z) on <ref> [~; 1] </ref> by any Moebius transformation with fixed points at ~ and 1, and similarly it is impossible to lower bound T (z) on [0; ~] by any Moebius transformation with fixed points at 0 and ~. <p> This leads to (EQ 54). Similarly, choosing F = ~, F + = 1, M 0 (~) = s 2 leads to a lower bound on T (z) valid in <ref> [~; 1] </ref>. To be precise, we claim (1 [1z] b ) b &gt; (z ~)s 2 (z 1) The proof is similar to, but even more painful than, the proof of (EQ 99), so we omit it.
