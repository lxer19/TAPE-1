Abstract: Alan Rector is Professor of Medical Informatics and leader of the University of Manchester Medical Informat-ics Group and the GALEN consortium. Over the past decade, he has led the group in pioneering new techniques for using terminologies based on description logics to integrate clinical systems and support high quality user interfaces. The PEN&Pad project [37], developed an advanced prototype data entry system for general practice. PEN&Pad was originally funded jointly by the MRC (SPG800091) and Department of Health and is now being commercialised under a Teaching Company Scheme (GR/H48811) in collaboration with VAMP Health Ltd, the largest supplier of systems to general practitioners in the UK. Negotiations are in progress with further vendors in both the primary and secondary care in both the UK and North America. The GRAIL description logic, developed to describe medical terminology and user interfaces for PEN&PAD [39, 40], was extended as the basis of a comprehensive approach multi-lingual terminology services by the GALEN and GALEN-IN-USE consortia led by the proposers and funded by the European Union (AIM 2012 HC 1018) [42]. (Description logics are the rigorous descendants of frame systems via KL-ONE.) The outcome of these projects is an approach to re-usable models of medical concepts, otherwise known as ontologies, which now forms the basis of collaborations with projects in Electronic Patient Records (ProRec and SYNAPSES), decision support (PRESTIGE), and nursing (TELENURSE), and has given rise to a Europe-wide concerted action on medical terminology (ToMeLo). The unusual features of the GRAIL description logic have led to its being used in non-medical applications including bio-informatics (TAMBIS, BBSRC/EPSRC grant BIF06344 plus Zeneca), art-history and multimedia [26]. A parallel processing implementation has been developed under the AIKMS programme (PAEPR GR/K42721). Recently, work on optimising new algorithms for classification in GRAIL, its support for transitivity and general concept inclusions, and its successful use in large scale real world projects have attracted wide interest [29, 30, 40]. Alan Rector is currently editing a special issue of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine on Medical Concepts and Terminology. He will take over-all responsibility for the proposed project and the design of the architecture and will ensure the project's continuing relevance to the medical applications from which it sprang. Carole Goble's primary work has been in multimedia and data modelling. More recently she has worked with the PEN&PAD and GALEN teams in the application of description logics to image and document archives, knowledge directed user interfaces and database integration. She currently jointly holds EPSRC grant GR/K42721 on Parallel Architectures for Electronic Patient Records which examines the foundations and efficiency of the GRAIL language implementation and the potential for parallel implementations of the classification algorithms. She is a co-grantholder of the TAMBIS (TAMBIS: Transparent Access to Multiple Biological Information Sources) project which is using GRAIL to integrate heterogeneous information systems (BBSRC BIF/05344 and supplementary support from Zeneca) related to DNA and Protein sequencing and associated information. She is also co-grantholder, with Alan Rector, on the EPSRC/DTI grant developing commercial versions of the clinical user interface based on Norman Paton's research activities have been in the area of the design and development of advanced database management systems including active databases and spatial databases, the integration of deductive and object-oriented facilities within databases, and the design of database interfaces. He is joint grantholder on two EP-SRC projects - `Integrating Deductive, Object-Oriented and Spatial Data Handling Capabilities in a DBMS' (GR/J99360) and `Systematic Generic Support for User Interfaces to Database Systems' (GR/L02852) and is also co-grantholder with Carole Goble on the TAMBIS project described above. He was also a grantholder on a recently completed project on `Optimisation and Evaluation of Active Rules in Object-Oriented Databases' (GR/H43847), and was Scientist in Charge of a node of the EU Human Capital and Mobility Network, ACT-NET. He is co-author of two textbooks (one on Object-Oriented Databases, the other on Database Programming Languages), and joint editor of the proceedings of the 1st Int. Workshop on Rules In Database Systems.
