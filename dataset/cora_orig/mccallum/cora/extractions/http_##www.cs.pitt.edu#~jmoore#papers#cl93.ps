Reference-contexts: Unless the examples are numerous enough and well chosen, this may be difficult to achieve (Klausmeier 1976). However, when a general description is not understood by itself, examples provide effective elaboration and may help the hearer assimilate the general description <ref> (Charney et al. 1988) </ref>. In the sample dialogue, because the teacher knows that she has already given a general description in turn 8, she can give a very specific example in turn 10. Another characteristic of advisory dialogues is exemplified in this sample.

Reference-contexts: The systems that have been built within this framework to date (Cohen 1978; Appelt 1985) plan short (one- or two-sentence) texts to achieve the speakers' goal (s). In this approach, the intentional structure describing the speaker's purposes and the relationships between them <ref> (Grosz and Sidner 1986) </ref> is explicitly represented. However, this approach does not represent or use rhetorical knowledge about how speech acts may be combined into larger bodies of coherent text to achieve a speaker's goals. <p> For Grosz and Sidner, intentions are the basic determiner of discourse segmentation. A segment must have an identifiable discourse segment purpose (DSP), and embedding relationships between segments are a surface reflection of relationships among their associated DSPs <ref> (Grosz and Sidner 1986, p. 177-178) </ref>. Therefore, text spans and text segments are based on quite different criteria. In a text plan produced by our system, any subtree headed by a communicative goal (i.e., an intention) corresponds to a discourse segment in Grosz and Sidner's theory. <p> To perform these tasks, our system must understand how the previous responses stored in its discourse history relate to one another. That is, we must address issues of how to build a representation of the intentional structure of the dialogue that is emerging across conversational turns <ref> (Grosz and Sidner 1986) </ref> and to track global focus (Grosz 1977).

Reference-contexts: From the hearer's perspective, understanding why the speaker continued as he or she did is equivalent to determining what relation was used. 14 Hobbs originally proposed coherence relations as a way of solving some of the problems in interpreting discourse, e.g., anaphora resolution <ref> (Hobbs 1979) </ref>. He defines coherence relations in terms of inferences that can be drawn from the propositions asserted in the items being related.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Explanation systems must produce multisentential texts, including justifications of their actions, descriptions of their problem-solving strategies, and definitions of the terms they use. Previous research in natural language generation has shown that schemata of rhetorical predicates (McKeown 1985; McCoy 1989; Paris 1988) or rhetorical relations <ref> (Hovy 1991) </ref> can be used to capture the structure of coherent multisentential texts. Schemata are script-like entities that encode standard patterns of discourse structure. Associating a schema with a communicative goal allows a system to generate a text that achieves the goal. <p> As we will see, Rhetorical Structure Theory can be adapted to a computational model in a fairly natural way, and in fact there is an implemented prototype of the theory <ref> (Hovy 1991) </ref>. However, the straightforward operationalization that is used in this prototype suffers from a fundamental problem for our purposes. After discussing the two theories that link intention to rhetorical structure, we discuss this problem in detail.

Reference-contexts: However, note that such specifications of the speaker's intentions are not an explicit part of the formal definition of the relation. For this reason we have chosen an alternative theory of text structure, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) <ref> (Mann and Thompson 1988) </ref>, as a basis for our text planning system. <p> The minimal unit is essentially a clause, except that clausal subjects and complements and restrictive relative clauses are considered parts of their host clause rather than as separate units <ref> (Mann and Thompson 1988, p. 248) </ref>. Thus, at least at the lowest level of analysis, text spans can be determined on the basis of syntactic structure alone. For Grosz and Sidner, intentions are the basic determiner of discourse segmentation.

Reference-contexts: This time, when attempting to achieve the goal, the planner must 49 select an alternative strategy. Recovery heuristics are responsible for selecting an alternative strategy when responding to such follow-up questions <ref> (Moore and Swartout 1989) </ref>. One of these indicates that when the goal is to make the user know a concept, a good recovery strategy is to give examples.

Reference-contexts: To approximate the query above, the user could highlight the system's original recommendation to replace SETQ with SETF, and select Why? from the menu that appears. As a result of interpreting this Why?, the system posts the communicative goal: (PERSUADED USER (DO USER REPLACE-1)); see <ref> (Moore and Swartout 1990) </ref> for more details. 50 RST relation, the system has no other strategies for achieving the persuade goal. However, it does have several other rhetorical strategies for MOTIVATION.

Reference-contexts: To use this approach in a generation process, the system first generates hypotheses about what combinations of actions to perform. For efficiency, Appelt (1985) uses simplified versions of the axioms (called action summaries) encoded in NOAH-style plan operators <ref> (Sacerdoti 1977) </ref> to generate these hypotheses. Theorem-proving is then used to determine if a series of proposed actions will have the desired effect on the hearer's mental state. <p> The next two levels correspond to the top two levels of Appelt's hierarchy: illocutionary acts (e.g., inform, request), and locutionary acts (assert, ask, command). 14 The actions at each level in the hierarchy have been encoded into plan operators that are used in a process of hierarchical decomposition <ref> (Sacerdoti 1977) </ref> to refine rhetorical acts through illocutionary acts into locutionary acts. An example operator from Maybury's system is shown in Figure 20.

Reference-contexts: McKeown found that schemata alone were not sufficient to constrain the generation process. To overcome this, when a schema indicates that more than one choice is possible, McKeown's system appeals to constraints on the shift of focus of attention <ref> (Sidner 1979) </ref>. These constraints guide the selection of the information that fits in best with the previous discourse. Since McKeown's seminal work, many other researchers have used schemata as the basis for producing multisentential texts.
