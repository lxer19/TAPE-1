Abstract: According to the utilitarian paradigm, an autonomous intelligent agent's interactions with the environment should be guided by the principle of expected utility maximization. We apply this paradigm to reasoning about an agent's physical actions and exploratory behavior in urgent, time-constrained situations. We model an agent's knowledge with a temporalized version of Kripke structures|as a set of branching time lines described by fluents, with accessibility relations holding among the states comprising the time lines. We describe how to compute utility based on this model which reflects the urgency that the environment imposes on time. Since the physical and exploratory actions that an agent could undertake transform the model of branching time lines in specific ways, the expected utilities of these actions can be computed, dictating rational tradeoffs among them depending on the agent's state of knowledge and the urgency of the situation.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to these issues is strongly motivated by the utilitarian paradigm for designing autonomous intelligent agents (see <ref> [ Doyle, 1992 ] </ref> for convincing arguments supporting this view). According to this paradigm, an agent's rationality is equivalent to its ability to choose among its possible behaviors so as to maximize its expected utility. <p> Our work builds on a large body of previously reported research on utility-based approaches in AI <ref> [ Doyle, 1992 ] </ref> . <p> Further, while the logical language capturing various forms of action is useful, these logics by themselves are not capable of fully supporting purposeful choice among alternative behaviors <ref> [ Doyle, 1992 ] </ref> . Other related work on formal, logically oriented approaches [ Moore, 1990; Morgenstern, 1987 ] is based on similar intuitions to ours, but lacks the utilitarian perspective. <p> The part that is missing, of course, is the relative value of time and other resources wasted in the process, but that is precisely what makes this an issue in economics, rather than in logic <ref> [ Doyle, 1992 ] </ref> . It is in this context that one can understand why looking up a number in the phone book actually pays off. <p> The major difference between his work and ours is that his does not include the element of expected utility, and therefore does not address the crucial issue of motivation and choice of action <ref> [ Doyle, 1992 ] </ref> , referring instead to the logically-motivated work of Cohen and Levesque [ Cohen and Levesque, 1987 ] . Further, Shoham envisions the evolution of the agent's knowledge as a series of time line structures, while we represent it as accessibility relations within one such structure.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we concentrate on physical and informative actions. We present a preliminary framework to model an agent's uncertain knowledge about the temporal evolution of its environment. The model, essentially a temporal Kripke structure, is based on sets of branching time lines <ref> [ McDermott, 1982 ] </ref> . We augment a set of time lines with accessibility relations to represent the knowledge of the agent evolving in time. The time lines are described by fluents, that is, by attributes with time-varying values. <p> The branching time lines are composed of chronicles consisting of totally temporally ordered states.

Finally, we plan on investigating the issue of rationality of reasoning under time pressure in an attempt to address the issue of rational choice among sensing, reasoning, and physical actions in time-constrained domains.
