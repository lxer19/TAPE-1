Title: Model-Based Echolocation of Environmental Objects

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm that can recognize and localize objects given a model of their contours using only ultrasonic range data. The algorithm exploits a physical model of the ultrasonic beam and combines several readings to extract outline object segments from the environment. It then detects patterns of outline segments that correspond to predefined models of object contours, performing both object recognition and localization. The algorithm is robust since it can account for noise and inaccurate readings as well as efficient since it uses a relaxation technique that can incorporate new data incrementally without recalculating from scratch. fl Technical Report GIT-CS-95/01, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, 1995.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ultrasonic sensors are relatively inexpensive devices commonly used in mobile robots. These devices calculate range information from the time-of-flight of sonar echoes. Several obstacle avoidance strategies that use this sensor modality have been developed with successful results <ref> [1, 4, 7] </ref>. These techniques, however, have not dealt with the issue of identifying or recognizing specific object contours in a real world environment. This paper presents a novel algorithm that can recognize and locate objects using only ultrasonic range data. <p> A Denning MRV-III mobile robot was used for gathering data. The simulator is based on this robot as well. The mobile robot has a diameter of 2.5 feet. For both the simulations and the actual robotic experiments, the robot navigated using schema-based reactive control <ref> [1] </ref> with move-ahead and avoid-static-obstacle behaviors active. A model based on a semi-circle was provided to the algorithm for both environments. The semicircle was approximated by five segments of equal length with a 2 foot diameter.

Reference-contexts: The occupancy grid is used for obstacle avoidance, landmark recognition, and localization (updating the robot's estimate of its position and orientation). This technique, however, is computationally expensive, often requiring several minutes of time on a VAX to perform this match. Borenstein <ref> [5] </ref> describes a real-time obstacle avoidance method which uses a histogram grid as a local world model. Range data from ultrasonic sensors are used to continuously update this data structure.

Reference-contexts: Obstacle avoidance consists of 1 moving towards the direction having the least obstacle density. The emphasis is made in detecting occupied areas but with no regard to obstacle shape recognition. Drumheller <ref> [6] </ref> developed an algorithm to determine a robot's position and orientation using only ultrasonic range data. The algorithm works by correlating straight segments in the range data against a room model which is described as a list of segments indicating the position of the walls.

Reference-contexts: The location of an obstacle is determined by using an unbiased estimator of the time-of-flight (TOF) of the ultrasonic wave. The emphasis of their method is to provide an efficient sensor configuration for obstacle position estimation. Elfes <ref> [8] </ref> describes a technique using a data structure referred to as an occupancy grid. This grid represent a sonar map which integrates range measurements from multiple sensors mounted on the robot. The measurements are combined using a method that accounts for the uncertainties and errors inherent in the data.

International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems, </booktitle> <pages> pp. 239-247, </pages> <address> Pittsburg, PA, </address> <year> 1993. </year> <month> 13 </month>
Reference-contexts: Also, the algorithm does not integrate measurements over time like the methods that use grids. Thus, it lacks the capability of improving the definition of the contour as the robot gathers more data. Finally, an algorithm was developed by McKerrow <ref> [9] </ref> that estimates outline segments using sonar data. The algorithm works by combining two consecutive ultrasonic range readings of the same sensor at two different positions. <p> The algorithm described by McKerrow <ref> [9] </ref> serves as the basis for this method. This approach exploits a physically-based model of the range readings by creating an obstacle surface segment that is consistent with the characteristics of the sensor readings. A model of the range reading in two dimensions appears in Figure 1. <p> This estimate consists of a tangent segment joining the two consecutive arcs. The sensor arcs and the resulting estimation of an outline segment is illustrated in Figure 2. For further details about this feature extraction algorithm, the interested reader is referred to <ref> [9] </ref>. An entire segment ring reading consists of an array of outline segments where each cell in the array corresponds to the segment estimated for an ultrasonic sensor in the ring (see Figure 3).
