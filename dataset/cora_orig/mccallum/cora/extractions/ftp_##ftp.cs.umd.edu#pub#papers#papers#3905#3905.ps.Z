Abstract: We develop a numerical evaluation method for adaptive hierarchical QoS routing, and demonstrate its viability by application to two networks. Our approach models aggregation and delayed feedback in a straightforward way, and is scalable to the large networks needed to evaluate hierarchical routing.

Reference-contexts: The weighting function W R (t) is, in general, a function of the router's view, to be chosen to achieve a high likelihood of successful setup. In this report we use weights defined by <ref> [2] </ref>: W R (t) = H R (t) L R (t) where H R (t) is the path hop length, L R (t) is the path utilization (average of the utilizations of the path's links), and F R (t) is a measure of the feasibility of the path.
