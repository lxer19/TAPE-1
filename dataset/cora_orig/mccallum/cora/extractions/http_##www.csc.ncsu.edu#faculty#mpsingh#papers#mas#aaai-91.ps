Abstract: Know-how is an important concept in Artificial Intelligence. It has been argued previously that it cannot be successfully reduced to the knowledge of facts. In this paper, I present sound and complete axiomatizations for two non-reductive and intuitively natural formal definitions of the know-how of an agent situated in a complex environment. I also present some theorems giving useful properties of know-how, and discuss and resolve an interesting paradox (which is described within). This is done using a new operator in the spirit of Dynamic Logic that is introduced herein and whose semantics and proof-theory are given.
