Reference-contexts: A well known result presented in [20] proves the impossibility of reaching agreement in an asynchronous system. However, many distributed applications require agreement on group membership among group members in order to operate correctly. Practical systems circumvent this problem by taking a presumably faulty entity out of a view <ref> [1, 19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The sensitivity of congress to host failures and network partitions might prove as a handy tool for a class of fault-tolerant reliable multicast packages such as Transis <ref> [2] </ref>, Isis [10, 11] and Horus [24] when operating in an ATM environment. These packages make use of failure detectors in order to provide strong group semantics to applications using them. Members in a group need to reach agreement on membership in order to make conclusions about common knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Another tool for multicast, a multipoint-to-multipoint distribution tree, is presented in [14] and used for propagating signalling information. There are also multicast protocols that make use of a multicast server to manage multicast connections such as <ref> [3] </ref> (mainly within subnets) and [12] in which a group communication server is used to collect control information to achieve reliability. In all of these techniques, an explicit list of the recipients' ATM end-point addresses is necessary for the establishment of the connection.

Reference-contexts: Many of these applications make use of highly dynamic multicast groups. One example is a TV broadcasting service that serves groups of clients that may join or leave constantly. Although ATM network protocols ( <ref> [4, 5] </ref>) enable the formation of multicast connections that may be used by such applications, there is no mechanism for managing membership information of multicast groups. <p> The currently established standards of ATM UNI 3.1 and 4.0 <ref> [4, 5] </ref> offers the point-to-multipoint connection type to enable multicast over native ATM. Another tool for multicast, a multipoint-to-multipoint distribution tree, is presented in [14] and used for propagating signalling information. <p> Updates on membership are necessary especially when only root-initiated join is possible, as in the UNI 3.1 <ref> [4] </ref> signaling protocol. However, even when leaf-initiated join is possible, as is in the UNI 4.0 [5] standard, the joining party must know the VC assigned to that specific connection, which is less abstract then a logical group name.

Reference-contexts: Whenever a new member joins or leaves the group, the root of the point-to-multipoint connection receives an update and can include/discard the new member in the connection. It should be noted that UNI 4.0 does provide group addresses, which are used to support the ATM anycast service (see <ref> [6] </ref>). However, this service allows a user to request a point-to-point connection only to a single ATM end-point that is a member of the group. The user is not provided with a mechanism to resolve the ATM group address into a list of end-point members. <p> The first two problems may be resolved in framework of an ATM anycast service provided by UNI 4.0 <ref> [6] </ref>. However, ATM anycast service provides its user with point-to-point 3 connections only. In order to achieve efficiency, native ATM multicast connections should be used.

Reference-contexts: We also assume the existence of a global signaling protocol such as the PNNI signaling protocol that enables connection set-up across the network. Reliable point-to-point communication is assumed between the congress servers. This 2 The full reference model for native ATM services (Native ATM SAP) is given in <ref> [7] </ref>. 7 can be achieved by using any reliable unicast protocol between the neighboring entities 3 . The network itself (links and switches) as well as the hosts are not assumed to be failure-free. Network partitions/re-merges, and host crashes/recoveries may occur, dividing the network into several components.

Reference-contexts: This is explained in detail in Section 4.5. 3 Environment We assume the existence of a global hierarchical addressing scheme that enables to relate nodes (switches and ATM based hosts) to domains and sub-domains by their ATM address prefixes. The addressing scheme proposed by the PNNI signaling protocol <ref> [8] </ref> that divides the hosts and switches in the network into peer groups based on ATM address prefixes is an example of such a scheme.

Reference-contexts: The probability that such scenarios will occur grows as the network becomes larger and more end-points participate in the protocol. Although a name-locking mechanism could be implemented (e.g., using a two-phase commit protocol <ref> [9] </ref>), this mechanism incurs a high overhead at connection set-up time and should definitely not be forced on all end-points that use congress.

Reference-contexts: An active server would resolve the clients' addresses through the group name "PayTV" in order to establish a point-to-multipoint connection to the clients. Video Chat Application As a second example, consider a video chat application, like CU-SeeMe <ref> [15] </ref>, implemented over native ATM. The most natural mechanism for the data transfer in such application would be multicast. The problem, however, is that the membership of a group of participants is not known in advance.

Practical systems circumvent this problem by taking a presumably faulty entity out of a view [1, 19]. <p> Some membership information may be delayed in the network and by the time an end-point receives a resolution reply for a group membership, the real membership of the group may have already changed. This is true for any protocol working in an asynchronous environment <ref> [20] </ref>. congress guarantees that if the group membership stops changing at some point, then eventually any resolution request for the 6 group name will result in the correct list of addresses for the members of this group.
