Abstract: The standard methods for extracting range data from optical triangulation scanners are accurate only for planar objects of uniform reflectance illuminated by an incoherent source. Using these methods, curved surfaces, discontinuous surfaces, and surfaces of varying reflectance cause systematic distortions of the range data. Coherent light sources such as lasers introduce speckle artifacts that further degrade the data. We present a new ranging method based on analyzing the time evolution of the structured light reflections. Using our spacetime analysis, we can correct for each of these artifacts, thereby attaining significantly higher accuracy using existing technology. We present results that demonstrate the validity of our method using a commercial laser stripe triangulation scanner.

Reference-contexts: However, diffraction limits prevent us from focusing the beam to an arbitrary width. The limits on focusing a Gaussian beam with spherical lenses are well known [15]. In recent years, Bickel, et al, <ref> [3] </ref> have explored the use of axicons (e.g., glass cones and other surfaces of revolution) to attain tighter focus of a Gaussian beam. The refracted beam, however, has a zeroth order Bessel function cross-section; i.e., it has numerous side-lobes of non-negligible irradiance.

Reference-contexts: For optical triangulation systems that extract range from single imaged pulses at a time, variations in surface reflectance and shape result in systematic range errors. Several researchers have observed one or both of these accuracy limitations <ref> [4] </ref> [12] [16]. For the case of coherent illumination, the images of reflections from rough surfaces are also subject to laser speckle noise, introducing noise into the range data.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers have observed a stationary speckle phenomenon as well [1]. Proper analysis of this problem is an open question, likely to be resolved with the study of the governing equations of scalar diffraction theory for imaging of a rough translating surface under coherent Gaussian beam illumination <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Implementation We have implemented the spacetime analysis presented in the previous section using a commercial laser triangulation scanner and a real-time digital video recorder. 4.1 Hardware The optical triangulation system we use is a Cyberware MS platform scanner.

Reference-contexts: This range error is very similar to the error encountered in Figure 2c. The fourth source of range error is laser speckle, which arises when coherent laser illumination bounces off of a surface that is rough compared to a wavelength <ref> [7] </ref>. The surface roughness introduces random variations in optical path lengths, causing a random interference pattern throughout space and at the sensor.

Reference-contexts: We expect this improved data to ease the process of estimating topology, especially in areas of high curvature which are prone to edge curl artifacts. We will also investigate methods for increasing the resolution of the existing hardware by registering and deblurring multiple spacetime images <ref> [9] </ref>. Finally, we hope to apply the results of scalar diffraction theory to put the achievement of speckle reduction on sound theoretical footing.

Reference-contexts: Kanade, et al, <ref> [11] </ref> describe a rangefinder that finds peaks in time for a stationary sensor with pixels that view fixed points on an object. This method of peak detection is very similar to the one presented in this paper for solving some of the problems of optical triangulation; however, the authors in [11] <p> <ref> [11] </ref> describe a rangefinder that finds peaks in time for a stationary sensor with pixels that view fixed points on an object. This method of peak detection is very similar to the one presented in this paper for solving some of the problems of optical triangulation; however, the authors in [11] do not indicate that their design solves or even addresses these problems. Further, we show that the principle generalizes to other scanning geometries. In the following sections, we first show how range errors arise with traditional triangulation techniques.

Reference-contexts: Our method of choice for computing these statistics is a least squares fit of a parabola to the log of the data. We have experimented with fitting the data directly to Gaus-sians using the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares algorithm <ref> [13] </ref>, but the results have been substantially the same as the log-parabola fits. The Gaussian statistics consist of a mean, which corresponds to a range point, as well as a width and a peak amplitude, both of which indicate the reliability of the data.

Reference-contexts: Widths that are far from the expected width and peak amplitudes near the noise floor of the sensor imply unreliable data which may be down-weighted or discarded during later processing (e.g., when combining multiple range meshes <ref> [18] </ref>). For the purposes of this paper, we discard unreliable data. Finally, in step 4, we rotate the range points back into the global coordinate system. Traditionally, researchers have extracted range data at sampling rates corresponding to one range point per sensor scanline per unit time.
