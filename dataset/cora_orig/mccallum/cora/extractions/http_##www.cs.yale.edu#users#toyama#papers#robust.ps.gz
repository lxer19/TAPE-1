Abstract: One quality that makes biological systems appear intelligent is their robustness to difficult circumstances. Robustness is crucial to intelligent behavior and important to AI research. We distinguish between ante-failure and post-failure robustness for causal tasks. Ante-failure robust systems resist failure, whereas post-failure systems incorporate the ability to recover from failure once it happens. We point out the power of post-failure robustness in AI problems, closely examining one example in visual motion tracking. Finally, we raise theoretical issues and argue for greater effort towards building post-failure robust systems.

Reference-contexts: We argue that post-failure robustness is a fundamental requirement of robust systems and present an example in visual tracking to back this claim. Our final aim is to encourage efforts to build post-failure robust agents. Ante-Failure Robustness Attempts to characterize robustness abound in statistics and engineering literature <ref> (Berger 1985) </ref>. All of these definitions characterize types of ante-failure robustness: they quantify the ability of a system to resist failure in adverse conditions. Ante-failure robustness analysis originates from efforts in statistics to develop robust estimators. <p> This statistical notion extends naturally to analogous concepts in decision theory and control theory. Bayesian robustness, which is informally described as "the sensitivity of [a] decision to assumptions ... that are uncertain" <ref> (Berger 1985) </ref>, is concerned with possible errors or uncertainties in the specification of prior distributions or utilities and how they affect a decision. In control theory, the question is whether a system built to achieve some goal can do so in the presence of different kinds of disturbances (Elbert 1984). <p> Monitoring for different kinds of deviations will require separate checking for each dimension of deviation. Another, perhaps more interesting, example is that statistical robust estimators lose precision on good data. The better modeled the data, the worse robust estimators perform when compared with optimal estimators <ref> (Berger 1985) </ref>. Finally, in most domains, perfect failure prevention is impossible. Causal domains are usually associated with uncertainty about the environment, the very thing that makes many AI domains interesting.

Reference-contexts: More recently, behavior-based systems display post-failure robustness. Behavior-based robot systems appear to possess an "emergent" intelligence, running high-level behaviors such as empty can collection when possible, and running low-level behaviors such as obstacle avoidance and aimless wandering at other times <ref> (Brooks 1986) </ref>. Even if the desired high-level activity is not carried out successfully, these robots are able to survive in their environment. Post-failure robustness is achieved by waiting out difficult circumstances with simple behavior.

Reference-contexts: In control theory, the question is whether a system built to achieve some goal can do so in the presence of different kinds of disturbances <ref> (Elbert 1984) </ref>. A robust control system would be able to converge to its goal in spite of small disturbances. These concepts are intimately related. In some cases, good solutions in one domain transfer to another.

Reference-contexts: The planning literature has perhaps been the most actively involved in post-failure robustness. Two different paradigms were recognized as important in early planning work. Conditional planning attempts to account for possible action failures by planning for just such contingencies <ref> (Fikes, Hart, & Nilsson 1972) </ref>, and replanning allows for adjustment or reconstruction of plans when execution deviates from an original plan (Ambros-Ingerson & Steel 1988). We hope to see this research continue, and more importantly, teach relevant lessons to the rest of the AI community.

Reference-contexts: Still, most of this work sidesteps the issue of recovery itself. In some instances, the recovery is performed by the researchers themselves (Michie & Chambers 1968), and in others, the work is performed entirely in an virtual environment, where "recovery" only requires reinitialization of abstract data <ref> (Furuta, Ochiai, & Ono 1984) </ref>. Learning from trial and error, though ultimately dependent on post-failure recovery, is therefore a separate problem. Non-learning systems can be extremely robust, as many lower animals are, and systems capable of learning can be very brittle, as many existing robots are.

Reference-contexts: As our ante-failure example (AF), we use an SSD-based correlation technique which detects and factors out occlusions by ignoring outliers | pixels which are significant mismatches in an otherwise well-correlated image <ref> (Hager & Belhumeur 1996) </ref>. AF is an example of a standard ante-failure approach: methods from robust statistics are applied to filter out non-signal data. For our post-failure example (PF), we use the face tracker described above.

Reference-contexts: The IFA face tracking system has been demonstrated many times both in and out of its normal environment and has survived rigorous testing by skeptical audiences <ref> (Hager & Toyama 1996b) </ref>. The subjective experience of watching the system in action is that it is extremely robust.

Reference-contexts: Robustness is a hallmark of intelligent behavior. It is an elusive quality that is ubiquitous in biological systems, yet rare in artificial ones. We can build systems like Deep Blue that challenge world champions in chess <ref> (Hsu et al. 1990) </ref>. Yet, no system can reliably play the physical game of chess. Plenty of systems are able to move pieces from square to square in very constrained environments, but few systems, if any, can handle the differences in piece appearance from set to set.

Reference-contexts: Changes in ambient lighting are often handled by concentrating on color cues (Kahn et al. 1996; Wren et al. 1995). And, fast or unpredictable motion can be attacked with combinations of faster hardware, full-frame processing (Burt 1988; Nishihara 1996), or probabilistic dynamics <ref> (Isard & Blake 1996) </ref>. Some have tried to make visual tracking ante-failure robust with respect to all of these problems (Isard & Blake 1996; Toyama & Hager 1995), but none have succeeded for two reasons. First, the component solutions to the problem are not always reliable. For ex framework.

Reference-contexts: Ante-failure robustness analysis originates from efforts in statistics to develop robust estimators. Mention of robustness goes back to 1953 (Box 1953; Rey 1983): "... a statistical procedure is described as robust if it is not very sensitive to departure from the assumptions on which it depends" <ref> (Kendall & Buck-land 1981) </ref>. These departures from assumptions, some of which appear in the form of outliers, refer to observations which fall outside of the expected distribution of observations due either to unmodeled noise processes or pathological quirks of the observed system.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the literature in reinforcement learning has always taken for granted that agents will be able to recover from failures (Kaelbling 1990; Watkins 1989). Still, most of this work sidesteps the issue of recovery itself. In some instances, the recovery is performed by the researchers themselves <ref> (Michie & Chambers 1968) </ref>, and in others, the work is performed entirely in an virtual environment, where "recovery" only requires reinitialization of abstract data (Furuta, Ochiai, & Ono 1984).

Reference-contexts: In signal processing, time-independent, noncausal tasks admit to a formulation in which all of the information about the problem can be given up front and for which the response by a task-solving system would be made after all input is given <ref> (Proakis & Manolakis 1996) </ref>. At most, the task can have one deadline for responses, and it must be a hard deadline. Such a task is a "one-shot" problem where the solution is a single set of outputs or a single action. Failure in noncausal problems means unrecoverable failure.

Reference-contexts: From the outset, we ask students to make their projects "robust." By this, we mean that their programs should respond in a reasonable manner regardless of the input. In the systems community, robustness, or reliability, is the primary focus <ref> (Siewiorek & Swarz 1982) </ref>. As early as 1952, von Neumann was concerned with "the synthesis of reliable organisms from unreliable components," by which he meant the construction of robust computational black boxes out of imperfect hardware parts (von Neumann 1956).
