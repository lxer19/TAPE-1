Title: An Overall View of the SPP IF Project: 'The Automatic Generation of Test Purposes'  
Author: Jens Grabowski Dieter Hogrefe and Daniel Toggweiler 
Abstract: The project 'The Automatic Generation of Test Purposes' is part of the second series of the 'Priority Programme Informatics' (SPP IF), Module 1: 'Safe Distributed Systems'. It intends to improve the testing process of communication systems. The work is funded partially by the Siemens-Albis AG in Zurich. The project started on 1. October 1994 and will be carried out at the University of Berne. This project presentation describes the problems which shall be tackled and explains the planed line of actions in order to solve the mentioned problems.

Reference-contexts: Protocol specification and test cases, i.e. the other input and output data of the two tasks (cf. Figure 2), can be assumed to be represented formally. Standardized formal description techniques (FDTs), i.e. SDL, Estelle, and LOTOS <ref> [2] </ref>, can be used to specify protocols formally and the standardized test notation TTCN [3] can be used to represent test cases.

Reference-contexts: FORMALIZING THE PROBLEM In order to automate the test purpose production we have to formalize the problem. At first we need some formal representation for the protocol specification and the test purposes. Secondly, from literature (e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>) we know that a conformance relation and additional assumptions and restrictions also influence the test purpose generation. <p> This work will start by analyzing conformance relations and test purposes of well known test case generation methods for FSMs. A summary of these methods can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4. PROJECT STRUCTURE The work on the project is structured into the tasks (1) System reduction, (2) Test purpose generation, (3) Case study, (4) Literature study, and (5) Publications (cf. Figure 6). The problems to be tackled by the Tasks 1 and 2 have been sketched in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: A test case should be finite in order to gain a test result in a reasonable time. A test purpose selects the (finite) part of the test case behavior which is required by the property. In the SaMsTaG approach test purposes are formalized by finite automata (FA) <ref> [6] </ref>. We intend to follow this approach. 2.3 Conformance Relation The aim of conformance testing is to prove a relation between the traces of the specification and SPP IF Information Conf.

Reference-contexts: For example, test purposes which focus on the message exchange between different entities of a communication system can be specified adequately by means of the frequently used graphical language Message Sequence Chart (MSC) <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. Other kinds of test purposes may require other formalisms for their representation. Our research on the generation of test purposes will consider the character of test purposes for different conformance relations and their user-friendly representation.
