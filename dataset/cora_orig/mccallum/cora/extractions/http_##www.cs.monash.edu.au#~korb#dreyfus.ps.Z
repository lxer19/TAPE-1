Title: Symbolic Rules and Neural Networks: AI Back at a Join Point

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has always been a controversial field of research, assaulted from without by philosophers disputing its possibility and riven within by divisions of ideology and method. Recently the re-emergence of neural network models of cognition has combined with the criticisms of Hubert Dreyfus to challenge the pre-eminent position of symbolicist ideology and method within artificial intelligence. Although the conceits of symbolicism are well worth exposing, I find the marriage between connectionism and Dreyfus's philosophical viewpoint unnatural and much of the disputation between connectionism and artificial intelligence misbegotten.

Reference-contexts: I can here only treat a few. One of Dreyfus's main criticisms of artificial intelligence, central to his What Computers Can't Do (1972) as well as his more recent Mind over Machine <ref> (Dreyfus and Drey-fus, 1986) </ref>, is that the rules typical of artificial intelligence programming are context-free whereas human actions are never performed without regard for context and so cannot be rule-governed.
