Abstract: This paper describes the recently developed "genetic programming" paradigm which genetically breeds populations of computer programs to solve problems. In genetic programming, the individuals in the population are hierarchical computer programs of various sizes and shapes. Three applications to problems in artificial intelligence are presented.

Reference-contexts: John Holland of the University of Michigan presented the pioneering formulation of genetic algorithms for fixed-length character strings in Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems <ref> (Holland 1975) </ref>. Holland established, among other things, that the genetic algorithm is a mathematically near optimal approach to adaptation in that it maximizes expected overall average payoff when the adaptive process is viewed as a multi-armed slot machine problem requiring an optimal allocation of future trials given currently available information.

Reference-contexts: The players choose their respective control variable simultaneously. (0, 0) X (X, Y) Y The analysis of this game can be simplified by reducing the number of state variables from four to two <ref> (Isaacs 1965) </ref>. This state reduction is accomplished by simply viewing the pursuer P as being at the origin point (0,0) of a new coordinate system at all times and then viewing the evader E as being at position (x, y) in this new coordinate system.

In this recently developed "genetic programming" paradigm, the individuals in the population are compositions of functions and terminals appropriate to the particular problem domain.
