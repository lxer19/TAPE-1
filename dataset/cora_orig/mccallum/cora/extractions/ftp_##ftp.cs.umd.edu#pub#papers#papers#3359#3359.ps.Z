Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying one of a set of polygonal models in the plane using point probes and finger probes. In particular, we give strategies for using a minimum number of finger probes to determine a finite number of possible locations of an unknown interior point p in one of the models. A finger probe takes as input an interior point p of a polygon P and a direction , and it outputs the first point of intersection of a ray emanating from p in direction with the boundary of P . We show that without a priori knowledge of what the models look like, no finite number of finger probes will suffice to localize the point p. When the models are given in advance, we give both batch and dynamic probing strategies for solving the problem. We consider both the case where the models are aligned rectilinear polygons and the case where the models are simple polygons.

Reference-contexts: We address this part of the problem in this paper. 3. Use point probes in a dynamic "decision tree" strategy to exactly identify the (model, location) pair present in the image. This part of the problem has been solved in <ref> [1] </ref>. To illustrate the above strategy, consider the following example.

Reference-contexts: Use a sparse set of point probes to find one "hit" point. That is, find one point that is on the boundary or in the interior of the object present in the image. This part of the problem has been addressed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 2. Use finger probes from the hit point found in Step 1 to narrow down the number of possible (model, location) pairs to a finite number. We address this part of the problem in this paper. 3.
