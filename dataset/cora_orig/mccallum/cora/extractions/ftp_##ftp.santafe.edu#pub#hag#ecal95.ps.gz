Abstract: Is there an Edge of Chaos, and if so, can evolution take us to it? Many issues have to be settled before any definitive answer can be given. For quantitative work, we need a good measure of complexity. We suggest that convergence time is an appropriate and useful measure. In the case of cellular automata, one of the advantages of the convergence-time measure is that it can be analytically approximated using a generalized mean field theory. In this paper we demonstrate that the mean field theory for cellular automata can 1) reduce the variablity of behavior inherent in the - parameter approach, 2) approximate convergence time, and 3) drive an evolutionary process toward increasing complexity.

Reference-contexts: Here the mean field theory is used to characterize the full space of cellular automaton rules. We view the mean field theory as a parametric representation of the space of cellular automata <ref> [Gut90] </ref>. Each setting of parameter values corresponds to a subset of cellular automaton rules. As the parameter values are changed, the properties of the corresponding cellular automata change as well.

Reference-contexts: The approach taken here is to limit the variability of behavior by using a set of parameters, the mean field parameters, which refine the parameter. 2.2 Mean Field Theory The mean field theory has mainly been used <ref> [GVK87] </ref> to characterize individual cellular automata. Here the mean field theory is used to characterize the full space of cellular automaton rules. We view the mean field theory as a parametric representation of the space of cellular automata [Gut90]. <p> A cellular automaton which gives rise to the coefficient values a is said to occupy the mean field class determined by a. Improvement of the mean field theory requires that the assumption that no correlations between cell states are generated by cellular automata be relaxed. A sequence of generalizations <ref> [GVK87] </ref>. of the mean field theory has been devised in which correlations are represented in terms of the probability of blocks of length l. In the following, we will use 2nd and 10th order mean field theory to approximate the behavior of rules.

Reference-contexts: Early evidence for the existence of an edge of chaos has been reported by Langton [Lan86, Lan90] and Packard [Pac88]. Langton based his conclusion on data gathered from a parameterized survey of cellular automaton behavior. Packard, on the other hand, used a genetic algorithm <ref> [Hol75] </ref> to evolve a particular class of complex rules. He found that as evolution proceeded the population of rules tended to cluster near the critical region identified by Langton.

Reference-contexts: We restrict ourselves to study of the edge of chaos in the context of cellular automata. It is in this context that these issues were originally brought forward. We note, however, that an important advance was made by Suzuki and Kaneko <ref> [KS93, SK94] </ref> who used the logistic map, with a well-defined transition of chaos, as the basis for genetic evolution. They found that under a suitable dynamic, evolution indeed proceeded toward this transition.

In fact, as pointed in [Lan90], rather than attempting to explain the phenomenology of computation as being due to an underlying phase-transition, in many ways it makes more sense to explain the phenomenology of phase-transitions as being due to fundamental limits on physical system's abilities to effectively "compute" their own dynamics.

Reference-contexts: For each radius a broad peak in convergence time is found. The location and width of these peaks is in close correspondence with previous empirical results using the parameter, e.g. those Li et al. <ref> [LPL90] </ref>. Thus, our convergence-time criterion provides an analytic measure of complexity in quantitative agreement with empirical measures. the parameter analysis. Here two mean field parameters, a 3 , and a 4 for radius-3 rules are varied, while the other parameters are held constant.
