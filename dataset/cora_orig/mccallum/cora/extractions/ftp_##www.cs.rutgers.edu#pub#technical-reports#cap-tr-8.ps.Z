Abstract: Computational simulation is an important tool for predicting the behavior of physical systems. Many powerful simulation programs exist today. However, using these programs to reliably analyze a physical situation requires considerable human effort and expertise to set up a simulation, determine whether the output makes sense, and repeatedly run the simulation with different inputs until a satisfactory result is achieved. Automating this process is not only of considerable practical importance but also raises significant AI research issues in the areas of spatial reasoning and deep models of expert reasoning about physics and numerical analysis.

Reference-contexts: Feedback could then modify the input to PMARC in order to try to produce more reliable flow predictions. 4.1 Spatial Reasoning Though spatial reasoning is of increasing interest to AI researchers <ref> [ Chen 1990 ] </ref> , this subfield is not yet sufficiently developed for it to be clear whether a set of generic spatial reasoning tasks can be defined, or what these tasks might be.

Reference-contexts: I've discussed this mechanism in prior publications <ref> [ Gelsey 1987, Gelsey 1989, Gelsey 1990, Gelsey 1991 ] </ref> . Modeling the behavior of this mechanism requires a series of assumptions. The first assumption is that Newton's laws of motion are adequate for this domain. <p> I've discussed the problem of identifying state variables and differential equations for clockwork mechanisms extensively in prior publications <ref> [ Gelsey 1987, Gelsey 1989, Gelsey 1990 ] </ref> , so I'll focus here on the fluid flow domain. The state of the fluid is represented by the value of the velocity potential (x; y; z) at every point. <p> Reasoning about geometrical symmetry (or partial symmetry) seems to be one fairly generic form of spatial reasoning, in the sense that it appears in many varied contexts, for example in reasoning about the kinematic behavior of mechanical devices <ref> [ Gelsey 1987 ] </ref> . Symmetry is quite an important consideration in choosing panelizations for PMARC. <p> In the mechanical device domain I've implemented programs to automatically set up and intelligently control computational simulations of clockwork mechanisms. <ref> [ Gelsey 1987, Gelsey 1989, Gelsey 1990, Gelsey 1991 ] </ref> . I am currently considering the problem of quality assurance for this domain. 6 Related Work Jambunathan et al.[1991] and Andrews [1988] discuss the use of expert systems technology to augment more traditional computational fluid dynamics programs.

Reference-contexts: However, our domain experts found this technique only gave reliable values for lift, not for drag, so they instead computed effective draft by integrating momentum and kinetic energy in the wake at a point far downstream from the yacht <ref> [ Letcher et al. 1987 ] </ref> . Our experiments have also confirmed that this method is preferable. We have successfully implemented the capabilities described above, and The program was set up to automatically run a series of computations for the same physical situation using different panelizations. <p> The actual span is 5, and in both cases the effective span computed using a sufficiently large number of panels is slightly lower, as would be expected due to efficiency losses at the wing tip. Our domain experts found wake integration to be the more reliable method <ref> [ Letcher et al. 1987 ] </ref> . Figure 8 only shows results of computations using wake integration: in this case panel pressure summation gave physically meaningless results.
