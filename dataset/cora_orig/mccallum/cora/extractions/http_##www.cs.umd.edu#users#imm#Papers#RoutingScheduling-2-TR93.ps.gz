Abstract: We propose a new approach to achieving type-of-service (TOS) with adaptive next-hop routing in wide-area networks such as the Internet. We consider two traffic classes, namely delay-sensitive and throughput-sensitive. In routing protocols such as OSPF and integrated IS-IS, each node has a different next-hop for each destination and TOS. Traditionally, each node has a single FCFS queue for each outgoing link, and the next-hops are computed using link measurements. In our approach, we attempt to isolate the two traffic classes by using two FCFS queues for each outgoing link, one for each TOS; the link is shared cyclicly between the two TOS queues. The next-hops for the delay-sensitive traffic adapts to link delays of that traffic. The next-hops for the throughput-sensitive traffic adapts to overall link utilizations. We compare our approach with the traditional approach using discrete-event simulation and Liapunov analysis (for stability of routes). The proposed approach offers lower end-to-end delay to the delay-sensitive traffic. A related property is that the routes for the delay-sensitive traffic are more stable, i.e. less oscillations. An unexpected property is that the overall end-to-end delay is lower; this is because the link utilization metric makes the throughput-sensitive traffic move away to under-utilized routes, thus isolating the two traffic classes and yielding a better overall network performance. fl This work is supported in part by ONR and DARPA under contract N00014-91-C-0195 to Honeywell and Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Reference-contexts: This link cost information is regularly disseminated to nodes of the network. Based on received link cost information, each node maintains and regularly updates its next-hop for each destination and TOS. The IP layer of the Internet Protocol suite specifies different TOS <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We viewed this system as a dynamical system <ref> [3] </ref>. We represented isolation by a stable state where all delay-sensitive traffic stays on the first path, and all throughput-sensitive traffic stays on the second path. We applied the Liapunov function method, and derived stability theorems ignoring propagation delays. <p> The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [3, 22] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin.

Reference-contexts: At any instant, we describe the state of the network by the tuple (x; y), where x is the number of delay-sensitive connections on path 1, and y is the number of throughput-sensitive connections on path 1. To model routing updates, we use a discrete-time flow approach as in <ref> [4] </ref>. We assume that (some or all) connections periodically update their routes to D every 4 time units, where 4 is long enough for the network to reach steady-state after a routing update.

Reference-contexts: TOS1 with respect to delays; TOS1 reaches saturation sooner. (See Figure 2.) Our explanation is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [21, 17, 5] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources.

Reference-contexts: It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class.

In this paper, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider a simple two-queue link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as type-of-service queueing. We consider two TOS: low delay and high throughput.

Reference-contexts: Among them are the minimum delay service required for example by interactive traffic or real-time traffic (e.g. audio), and the maximum throughput service required for example by bulk transfers such as network mail or FTP. Routing protocols such as the Internet OSPF [29] and the OSI IS-IS <ref> [7] </ref> provide separate next-hops for each TOS. However, the TOS mechanism has been so far of little use, and little is known on how well it would work in practice. In addition, many current routing protocols use static link costs 1 (which respond only to failures and recoveries).

Reference-contexts: However, the more links there are with only a small amount of available bandwidth along a path, the more likely that using this path will tie up more resources leading to congestion <ref> [8] </ref>. In fact, we found that such path cost metric leads to large routing oscillations and instability (even at low workload).

Reference-contexts: This means that a network's routing protocol should be able to determine appropriate routes for each TOS. Most of the design and analysis work on TOS assumes connection-oriented (or virtual-circuit) routing (e.g. <ref> [31, 14, 9, 36, 13] </ref>). This paper is concerned with achieving TOS using next-hop (datagram) routing on wide-area store-and-forward networks. Next-hop routing, which is currently used in the Internet, is a simple and robust way to do adaptive routing. Next-hop TOS routing is done as follows.

We consider two TOS: low delay and high throughput. <p> With type-of-service queueing, each node maintains two FCFS queues for each outgoing link, one for each type of service. The link bandwidth is allocated equally between the two queues in a round-robin fashion. (Type-of-service queueing is similar to the recently proposed fair-queueing discipline <ref> [10] </ref>, except that in fair-queueing, the link bandwidth is divided equally amongst the connections using the link, rather than the types of service.) For any link, the link cost for delay-sensitive traffic is obtained by exponentially averaging the measured delay that is experienced by delay-sensitive packets only. <p> This leads to oscillatory behavior, which in turn degrades performance [21]. This is the case with TOS1 due to the use of the FCFS link scheduling discipline. In TOS2, because delay-sensitive packets have a lower queueing delay under type-of-service queueing <ref> [10] </ref>, the measured link delay becomes dominated by transmission and propagation delays. Thus, the reported delay link costs do not change dramatically and the delay metric remains a good indicator of expected link delay after updating the routes [21].

Reference-contexts: To keep these views up-to-date, each node regularly broadcasts the link costs of its outgoing links to all other nodes using flooding 3 . As a node receives this information, it updates its view of the network topology and applies Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> to choose its next-hop for each destination and TOS. The method used to compute link costs for each TOS depends on the link scheduling discipline. In all cases, each node's outgoing link costs are updated regularly.

Reference-contexts: It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 5 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes <ref> [12] </ref>. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class. Thus, in order to maximize the throughput of the throughput-sensitive traffic, we should send its packets over the maximum capacity link, i.e. path 2.

Reference-contexts: Such simultaneous traffic shifts result in a bad performance, i.e. higher delay and network under-utilization. This effect increases as ff k increases. (In practice, ff k depend on several factors, and can be quite high <ref> [15] </ref>.) Consider the simple case where ff k = 1, for all k. It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 5 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes [12]. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we set the path cost metric to the sum of the link costs along the path from the source node to the destination node and use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm as in <ref> [17] </ref>.

A source produces data packets according to a packet-train model <ref> [18] </ref>. The workload consists of two parts, a delay-sensitive workload and a throughput-sensitive workload. For both parts, we use a uniform distribution of source-destination pairs over the nodes of the network.

Reference-contexts: Henceforth, we refer to our approach as TOS2. Our discrete-event simulations on a subset of the NSFNET-T1-Backbone topology show that TOS2 performs significantly better than TOS1 in a typical situation where the proportion of delay-sensitive traffic is small compared to the throughput-sensitive traffic <ref> [19] </ref>. TOS2 not only yielded a lower end-to-end delay for delay-sensitive packets (as expected), but also a lower overall end-to-end delay (which is unexpected). We argue that this is because with TOS2, the routing is significantly improved as we exploited the scheduling structure of type-of-service queueing when calculating link costs.

Consequently, at the next routing update the link reports a very low cost and becomes attractive again. This leads to oscillatory behavior, which in turn degrades performance <ref> [21] </ref>. This is the case with TOS1 due to the use of the FCFS link scheduling discipline.

This improves the performance of delay-based routing of delay-sensitive packets and results in more stable routes for that traffic class. Meanwhile, the link utilization metric makes the throughput-sensitive traffic move away from the 6 delay-sensitive traffic, taking the under-utilized routes. <p> Ignoring low values of U (T ), UTIL also provides lower delays than TOS1. However, UTIL performs worse than TOS2 over the whole range of U (T ). This is expected, since the utilization-based metric does not necessarily result in minimum delay routes (especially at light load) <ref> [21] </ref>. 3 Stability Analysis In this section, we consider a simple network model to gain more insight into the complicated behavior we observed in our simulation experiments. We derive stability conditions for the routes of the two traffic classes under both TOS schemes (TOS1, TOS2).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, non-convergence indicates that the system oscillates between different routing patterns (or has chaotic behavior). Note that I is not a continuous mapping, and well-known theorems for convergence requiring this property cannot be directly applied <ref> [22] </ref>. We represent isolation by a stable state where every delay-sensitive connection stays on path 1, and every throughput-sensitive connection stays on path 2. This is equivalent to say that our iterative method converges to the fixed point (N; 0). <p> The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [3, 22] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin.

Reference-contexts: To gain more insight into the system behavior with both TOS schemes (TOS1, TOS2), we analyzed in <ref> [26] </ref> a simple model of a single source-destination node pair connected by two (parallel) paths; the first path representing low delay routes, and the second path representing high capacity routes. We viewed this system as a dynamical system [3]. <p> In fact, it can be shown that C eff 1;k C 1 0:5y k . Regardless of that, we found that our approximation is only slightly optimistic. In particular, our monte-carlo simulations <ref> [26] </ref> show that starting at any point in D 2 satisfying 1 0:5C 1 N+x + P 1 1 (C 2 +0:5x)x + P 2 , the iteration indeed leads to the origin. <p> This region thus defines sufficient conditions to reach isolation for low enough ff k for both TOS1 and TOS2. This is in agreement with our monte-carlo simulations obtained in <ref> [26] </ref> which also show that in this region, TOS2 gives much better transient performance, i.e. less oscillations and much faster convergence to isolation, than TOS1 (we have not yet been able to obtain transient measures analytically). <p> Now, using these theorems, we derive sufficient conditions for isolation independent of the starting state (and the values of ff k ). 6 Figure 6 depicts the load regions defined by these sufficient conditions. 6 These conditions were obtained in <ref> [26] </ref> (in a different way) using a worst-case analysis. 16 Theorem 3.4 (i) For TOS1, the conditions N + M C 1 1 ( 1 C 2 N C 1 (regions B and C in (ii) For TOS2, the corresponding conditions are N 0:5C 1 1 ( 1 C 2 N

Reference-contexts: TOS2 uses type-of-service queueing. In all schemes, routing packets have priority over data packets; i.e. data packets can be scheduled for transmission only if there are no routing packets present. Regarding routing, we consider a link-state algorithm like the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm used in the ARPANET <ref> [27] </ref> and OSPF (Open SPF) used in the Internet [29]. Each node maintains a time-varying cost (explained below) for each outgoing link and TOS. Each node also maintains a view of the network topology, with a cost for each TOS and link in the network.

Reference-contexts: Among them are the minimum delay service required for example by interactive traffic or real-time traffic (e.g. audio), and the maximum throughput service required for example by bulk transfers such as network mail or FTP. Routing protocols such as the Internet OSPF <ref> [29] </ref> and the OSI IS-IS [7] provide separate next-hops for each TOS. However, the TOS mechanism has been so far of little use, and little is known on how well it would work in practice. <p> Regarding routing, we consider a link-state algorithm like the SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm used in the ARPANET [27] and OSPF (Open SPF) used in the Internet <ref> [29] </ref>. Each node maintains a time-varying cost (explained below) for each outgoing link and TOS. Each node also maintains a view of the network topology, with a cost for each TOS and link in the network.

Reference-contexts: The sequence of points (x 1 ; y 1 ); (x 2 ; y 2 ); : : : is called the trajectory of the system <ref> [24, 30] </ref>. The trajectory may or may not converge to a fixed point (x fl ; y fl ), i.e. (x fl ; y fl ) = I (x fl ; y fl ). The convergence to a fixed point indicates that the system stabilizes into a particular routing pattern. <p> starting state. (In a real network, the starting state would be the result of arrivals of new connections, departures of old connections, failure/recovery of links, etc.) We then obtain less refined sufficient conditions for isolation, independent of the starting state. 3.2 Liapunov Function Method We use the Liapunov function method <ref> [30] </ref> to obtain sufficient conditions for stability and convergence to a fixed point without actually solving the system equations. <p> Consequently, starting at any point in D 1 , the trajectory stays inside D 1 approaching the origin (as shown in Figure 3). End of Proof From lemma 3.1 and the Liapunov stability theory <ref> [30] </ref>, we have the following theorem: Theorem 3.1 For TOS1, any starting state in D 1 (the shaded area in Figure 3) leads to the origin, regardless of the values of ff k . <p> The proof of the above lemma is similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1, and is given in Appendix II. From lemma 3.2 and the Liapunov stability theory <ref> [30] </ref>, we have the following theorem: Theorem 3.2 For TOS2, assuming C eff 1;k C 1 0:5y k , any starting state in D 2 (the shaded area in Figure 4) leads to the origin, regardless of the values of ff k . 13 Effect of ff k on system behavior

Reference-contexts: This means that a network's routing protocol should be able to determine appropriate routes for each TOS. Most of the design and analysis work on TOS assumes connection-oriented (or virtual-circuit) routing (e.g. <ref> [31, 14, 9, 36, 13] </ref>). This paper is concerned with achieving TOS using next-hop (datagram) routing on wide-area store-and-forward networks. Next-hop routing, which is currently used in the Internet, is a simple and robust way to do adaptive routing. Next-hop TOS routing is done as follows. <p> It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class. This concept of isolating traffic classes using structured queueing disciplines has been used recently in flow control studies, e.g. <ref> [10, 20, 6, 31, 13] </ref>. In this paper, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider a simple two-queue link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as type-of-service queueing. We consider two TOS: low delay and high throughput.

Reference-contexts: Future work is also needed to explore the interaction between all components of the congestion control problem, namely scheduling, flow control, and routing, on arbitrary network topologies. We are also investigating other approaches to adaptive next-hop TOS routing. One approach <ref> [39] </ref> is to maintain for delay-sensitive traffic two minimum propagation delay routes and use the sec 17 ondary route when the primary route becomes congested. This approach attempts to avoid the bad effect that queueing delay may have when it dominates measured link delay in delay-based routing.
