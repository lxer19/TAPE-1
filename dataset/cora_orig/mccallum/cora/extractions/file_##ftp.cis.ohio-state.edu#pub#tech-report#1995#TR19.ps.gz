Abstract: Mobile computers use wireless channels to communicate with other computers. Efficient channel allocation is at the heart of the design of an efficient mobile computing system. The finite number of channels should be efficiently allocated to maximize throughput and avoid co-channel interference. Temporal variations in channel demand require channel allocation to adapt dynamically to the changing demand. In this paper we present a probabilistic analysis of the temporal imbalance in channel demand. The results provide guidelines for the design of dynamic distributed channel allocation strategies. The analysis indicates that the presence of load imbalance does not necessarily imply the possibility for channel transfer. Also, the effectiveness of channel transfer depends on the duration for which the imbalance persists. This duration is influenced in part by the velocity of mobile units. The wide variance in velocities of the mobile units can be handled by using a hierarchical cellular layout. Bulk channel transfers can be employed to reduce the overheads of channel transfer and to enable the system to quickly adjust to spatial variations in channel demand.

Reference-contexts: It will get more difficult in the future because the number of mobile units is increasing rapidly. Hence, the second option of cell planning looks more promising. Umbrella cells overlaying smaller microcells in urban areas <ref> [2] </ref> are one solution. Faster moving units can be connected to the umbrella cells and slower moving units can be connected to the smaller microcells.

Reference-contexts: A mobile host can have wireless communication with any other node in the network, fixed or mobile, only through the M SS of the cell in which it is present <ref> [3] </ref>. If a particular wireless channel is used concurrently by more than one communication session in the same cell, or in neighboring cells, the signals of the communicating units will interfere with each other. Such an interference is called co-channel interference.

Reference-contexts: Centralized channel allocation schemes have a single point of failure and are not robust <ref> [20] </ref>. Hence, distributed channel allocation schemes are preferred. Such schemes should be able to dynamically adjust to changes in load distribution. Load, in the context of channel allocation, stands for the demand for channels to support communication sessions. <p> If channels are not available to support a communication session, the request is dropped. The centralized algorithms are not robust. The M T SO is a single point of failure. If the M T SO goes down, it can bring down the entire network <ref> [20] </ref>. Also, during periods of high load, the M T SO and the communication subnet in its vicinity may become a bottleneck. Therefore, centralized algorithms are not scalable. Hence, a distributed channel allocation strategy is desirable. In a distributed channel allocation algorithm the M T SO is not needed. <p> This will reduce the number of transfer attempts and the resultant network traffic as it exploits the temporal and spatial locality of channel demand. A channel transfer algorithm that exploits the locality of demand has been presented in <ref> [20] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Dynamic distributed channel allocation was advocated for mobile computing due to its flexibility, robustness and scalability.

Reference-contexts: Thus using option (b) has the additional cost incurred in communication hand-off. 5. For load balancing in distributed systems, the processing overhead and the communication time needed for job transfer is small as compared to the job processing time <ref> [23] </ref>. The same does not hold for mobile communication. It may be true for voice communication over the cellular network where the link set-up time is of the order of fractions of a second and the subsequent duration of link usage is of the order of minutes.
