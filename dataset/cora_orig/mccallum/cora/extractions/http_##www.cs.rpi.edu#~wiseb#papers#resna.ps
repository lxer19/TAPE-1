Title: METAWIDGETS FOR MULTIMODAL APPLICATIONS  
Author: G. Bowden Wise and Ephraim P. Glinert 
Address: Troy, New York 12180  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  
Abstract: We present a new approach to multimodal systems development that enables end-user applications to present information in alternative modalities, thereby making them useful even in situations where the default output modality is unacceptable to the user. We discuss the implementation of a software framework for constructing multimodal applications using the multimedia PCs that are available today, and outline our plans for the future continuation of this work.
