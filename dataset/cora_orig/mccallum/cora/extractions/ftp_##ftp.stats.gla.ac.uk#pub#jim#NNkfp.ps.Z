Reference-contexts: These latter studies were restricted to the case where each local processor produces just a single probabilistic binary output, however. If the approach is to have either technological or biological relevance it is important to explore how it could be extended to processors that produce multiple distinct outputs <ref> (Becker, 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We take a conditional approach to the modelling of the outputs X given the RF and CF inputs R and C and assume that X follows a multivariate binary probability model <ref> (Besag, 1974) </ref>, given the realised values of the RF and CF inputs, with probability mass function Pr (X = xjR = r; C = c) = Z (a; u) 0 p X a i x i + 2 i=1 j2@i (x) 1 where Z (a; u) is the normalisation constant (i.e. <p> It is natural to consider the local conditional distributions for each output unit given its RF, CF and WP inputs. Under the assumed restrictions on the WP connection weights, described above, the Hammersley-Clifford theorem <ref> (Besag, 1974) </ref> ensures that working locally with the conditional distributions is equivalent to assuming a coherent global model for all the output units.

Reference-contexts: This model, in unconditional form, was used by Ising (1925) in statistical mechanics and developed as a model for spatial data by Besag (1974); however the general methodology works also with more general graph structures <ref> (Geman & Geman, 1984) </ref>. The Ising model has been employed in a different way in neural networks by Hopfield (1982) and many others within the area of recurrent networks.

Reference-contexts: This technique may also deal with more than two diverse data sets <ref> (Gifi, 1990) </ref> Computational studies by several groups of workers have shown that neural networks can use coherence across multiple streams of processing as a basis for the discovery of important features within streams (e.g. Becker, 1992; Becker & Hinton,1992; Schmidhuber & Prelinger, 1993; De Sa, 1994; Stone, 1995; Becker, 1996).

Reference-contexts: This evidence will be reviewed in detail elsewhere (Phillips & Singer, 1996), but in brief: * voltage-dependent synaptic receptor channels are common throughout cortex and would provide a mechanism for gain control; see, for example, Fox et al. (1990); * long-range horizontal collaterals are also common <ref> (Gilbert, 1992) </ref> and could pro vide contextual input to the gain-control channels; * synchronisation of the activity of cells with non-overlapping receptive fields (Singer, 1993) may reflect the the formation of cooperative population codes resulting from contextual guidance; * activity-dependent plasticity of the synapses mediating the response to receptive field stimulation

Reference-contexts: The three-way mutual information is defined by I (X; R; C) = I (X; R) I (X; RjC) (8) For the purposes of modelling it is more convenient to employ the simple rules of information theory <ref> (Hamming, 1980) </ref> and express this as F = H (X) 1 H (XjR) 2 H (XjC) 3 H (XjR; C); (9) where 1 = 1 2 ; 2 = 1 1 and 3 = 1 + 2 3 1.

Reference-contexts: 4 * there is now also evidence that the long-range horizontal connections undergo activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength (Hirsch & Gilbert, 1993; Lowel & Singer, 1992); finally, as predicted by our hypotheses, there is evidence that the long-range horizontal collaterals in V1 have a voltage-dependent and thus gain-controlling synaptic physiology <ref> (Hirsch & Gilbert, 1991) </ref>. In this paper the methodology proposed by Kay & Phillips (1994,1996) is extended to the case where each local processor has multivariate binary outputs. The paper proceeds as follows.

It is possible to implement them using on-line learning and this will be used in future work.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of the identity of surrounding phonemes or letters, and of the transitional probabilities between phonemes or letters within words, could be used to help disambiguate the ambiguous input, and there is a great deal of evidence that this occurs in both speech perception and reading <ref> (e.g. Massaro & Cohen, 1991) </ref>. For an example at earlier stages of processing, consider the attempt to detect a faint edge indicating the position and orientation of the boundary between land and sky in a distant hazy view.

As in all previous experiments, the fine structure of the RF weights after training depended on the number of units and on the initial random settings. However, since the input patterns employed here were simple and low-dimensional, the number of possible variations was not large. <p> There is a great deal of evidence from cognitive Local Multivariate Binary Processors 23 psychology and psychophysics that local context plays a major role in disambiguating ambiguous inputs in human information processing <ref> (Phillips & Singer, 1996) </ref>, and this is a computational strategy that is obviously likely to be of value in technological applications. Learned CFs therefore merit further study as a mechanism for implementing this strategy.
