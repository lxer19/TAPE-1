Reference-contexts: If the entire clientele of a multimedia server desires deterministic service guarantees (i.e., their continuous playback requirements should never be violated for the entire service duration), the corresponding admission control algorithm will be characterized by worst-case assumptions regarding the service time <ref> [1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 11] </ref>. Notice, however, that due to the human perceptual tolerances as well as the inherent redundancy in continuous media streams, most clients of a multimedia server are tolerant to brief distor-tions in playback continuity as well as occasional loss of media information. <p> The rate of increase in the number of clients, however, decreases with increase in R. 4.2 Evaluating the Statistical Admission Con trol Algorithm We have compared the performance of our statistical admission control algorithm with conventional deterministic admission control algorithms <ref> [1, 2, 10, 11] </ref> (see Figure 3). As is depicted in Figure 3, the statistical admission control algorithm achieves a 200% increase in the number of clients that can be serviced simultaneously by the server.

Reference-contexts: For the purposes of the simulations, each video strand is assumed to be encoded using a Variable Bit Rate (VBR) compression technique, and striped across the entire disk array. Successive blocks of a strand are assumed to be stored on the disk using the random placement model <ref> [3] </ref>. A greedy disk scheduling algorithm, which derives a retrieval sequence of media blocks from disk so as to simultaneously minimize both seek time and rotational latency, was employed for the simulations [9]. Furthermore, the playback rate of each video strand is assumed to be 30 frames/sec.

Reference-contexts: The realization of such information management systems of the future, however, will require the development of high performance, scalable multimedia servers which can provide a wide range of services to a large number of clients <ref> [4] </ref>. The fundamental problem in developing such multimedia servers is that images, audio, video, and other similar forms of data differ from numeric data and text in their characteristics, and hence require totally different techniques for their organization and management.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, using the central limit theorem, we conclude that the distribution function G B (b) of B approaches a normal distribution <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Additionally, since B i 's denote discrete random variables that take only integral values, they can be categorized as lattice-type random variables <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the procedure, consider a multimedia server that employs the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. Let k denote the number of media blocks that are to be retrieved during a round. Since, in the worst-case, each media block may be placed on a different cylinder, the disk head may have to be repositioned onto a new cylinder at most k times.

Reference-contexts: characteristics of a multimedia server, we have recently proposed an observation-based admission control algorithm, in which a new client is admitted for service only if the prediction from the status quo measurements of the server performance characteristics indicate that the service requirements of all the clients can be met satisfactorily <ref> [9] </ref>. It is based on the assumption that the average amount of time spent in retrieving a media block from disk does not change significantly even after a new client is admitted by the server. <p> A greedy disk scheduling algorithm, which derives a retrieval sequence of media blocks from disk so as to simultaneously minimize both seek time and rotational latency, was employed for the simulations <ref> [9] </ref>. Furthermore, the playback rate of each video strand is assumed to be 30 frames/sec.

Reference-contexts: The number of blocks of a media strand retrieved during a round is dependent on its playback rate requirement, as well as the buffer space availability at the client <ref> [10] </ref>. Ensuring continuous retrieval of each strand requires that the service time (i.e., the total time spent in retrieving media blocks during a round) does not exceed the minimum of the playback durations of the blocks retrieved for each strand during a round. <p> If the entire clientele of a multimedia server desires deterministic service guarantees (i.e., their continuous playback requirements should never be violated for the entire service duration), the corresponding admission control algorithm will be characterized by worst-case assumptions regarding the service time <ref> [1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 11] </ref>. Notice, however, that due to the human perceptual tolerances as well as the inherent redundancy in continuous media streams, most clients of a multimedia server are tolerant to brief distor-tions in playback continuity as well as occasional loss of media information. <p> The rate of increase in the number of clients, however, decreases with increase in R. 4.2 Evaluating the Statistical Admission Con trol Algorithm We have compared the performance of our statistical admission control algorithm with conventional deterministic admission control algorithms <ref> [1, 2, 10, 11] </ref> (see Figure 3).
