Title: Learning to Refine Case Libraries:  
Address: DC USA,  
Affiliation: Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington,  
Abstract: Initial Results Abstract. Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) systems, which incrementally extract a query description through a user-directed conversation, are advertised for their ease of use. However, designing large case libraries that have good performance (i.e., precision and querying efficiency) is difficult. CBR vendors provide guidelines for designing these libraries manually, but the guidelines are difficult to apply. We describe an automated inductive approach that revises conversational case libraries to increase their conformance with design guidelines. Revision increased performance on three conversational case libraries.

Reference-contexts: This has caused several companies to invest in costly consulting services or to try alternative technologies. We describe and evaluate a previously untested approach <ref> (Aha, 1997) </ref>, implemented in a system named Clire (Case LIbrary REvisor), for assisting case authors. Clire revises a given library to improve its conformance with a given set of design guidelines, with the intention of improving its CCBR performance. <p> We shared the revised case libraries with their owners and have received strong encouragement to continue this research. Our evaluation did not investigate why Clire delivered performance improvements for these three case libraries. We recently investigated this issue in <ref> (Aha & Breslow, 1997) </ref>. Clire modifies a case library in only two ways. First, it re-orders the hquestion,answeri pairs in each case. Second, it performs the case-specific feature selection process described in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: from each other and from the inactive cases. (This process can cause cases to appear at multiple leaves (i.e., in both C u and C i subtrees).) Clire's current implementation edits each case c j using a feature selection process reminiscent of Cardie's (1993), but operates on a case-specific basis <ref> (e.g., Domingos, 1997) </ref>. Specifically, it deletes any question answered in c j that does not appear on any path P between the root node and a leaf containing c j .

Reference-contexts: We designed this first version of Clire to induce a single tree using a top-down approach (see Figure 4). It does not use a splitting criterion (e.g., gain ratio <ref> (Quinlan, 1993) </ref>) that assumes the cases are clustered (e.g., by class). Instead, it selects a most frequently occurring question q among a node n's cases C to split them, provided that q isn't used to split n's ancestors.
