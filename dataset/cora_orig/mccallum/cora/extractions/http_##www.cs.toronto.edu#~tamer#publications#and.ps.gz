Reference-contexts: This basic technique has been applied to images <ref> [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13] </ref> by dividing the available image into a number of subimages and then averaging the log of their spectral magnitudes. <p> This leads to a poor estimate of the PSD of the original image. Another consequence of the image stationarity assumption and the use of space-invariant filtering is the fact that deblurred images suffer from edge-effects at the boundaries of the image <ref> [5] </ref>. In a simple representation of this problem it is assumed that the image is of infinite extent; however, practical images are of finite extent and a filter's behavior will vary depending upon assumptions made at the edges of the image.

Reference-contexts: This basic technique has been applied to images <ref> [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13] </ref> by dividing the available image into a number of subimages and then averaging the log of their spectral magnitudes. <p> Recent attempts to overcome the problems caused by the inherent nonstationarity of images have resulted in various adaptive techniques based on sectioning the given image into smaller subsections and assuming different stationary models for each section <ref> [8, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. Other techniques enhance the performance of nonadaptive filters by using radiometric and geometric transforms to generate nearly stationary (block stationary) images in the first and second moments [27]. The radiometric transform generates stationary mean and variance, while the geometric transform gives stationary autocorrelation. <p> Thus, the mean value of a section could be significantly different from its pixel values, and consequently, edge artifacts could arise at section boundaries. To partially solve the problem of edge artifacts, the sections could be overlapped by one-half the section size in each dimension <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. This technique, however, will not reduce edge effects at the image boundaries. 9 2.2 The Adaptive-Neighborhood Deblurring Method The AND algorithm is based on the use of AN regions determined individually for each pixel in the input image. In adaptive-neighborhood image processing (ANIP), the following approach is adopted.
