Reference-contexts: ALLIANT FX2800 An Alliant FX/2800 series computer. lib is one of the aforementioned library versions. Building the interpreter or stab scanner requires the use of the parser generator bison <ref> [DS88] </ref>, and the lexical analyzer for the interpreter is created using the flex utility [Law90], version 1.3 or later. Earlier versions of flex are incompatible, as the application executive contains its own version of the skeleton lexical analyzer "flex.skel".

Reference-contexts: It is perfectly reasonable to ask the question, "If the linker only includes the needed object files from a library, why does one need four different versions?" The motivation behind this was portability. Since the Vista project <ref> [TCJ + 91, JT91, TJC91a, TJC91b] </ref> relied on ae's internal symbol tables, and although the stab scanner and interpreter can be invoked, they were not imperative to the operation of Vista, the decision was made to create a version of ae (libae sym.a) that could be ported with the least amount

Reference-contexts: See Subsection 1.4.7. 1.4 The Interpreter The interpreter accepts a subset of the C programming language, as defined by Kernighan & Ritchie <ref> [KR88] </ref>. It is implemented in an entirely syntax-directed scheme; expressions are evaluated as they are parsed, that is, no intermediate expression trees are explicitly formed. Currently, the C subset consists of declarations, expressions (with function calls), blocks, functions, and the if and return statements. <p> Consequently, the result of a typeof expression has type ae type *. Like the sizeof operator, parentheses are only required around the operand if it 8 is a type name: typeof &lt;expression&gt; or typeof (&lt;type name&gt;) &lt;type name&gt; is defined in Kernighan & Ritchie <ref> [KR88] </ref>, Section A8.8. In the current implementation &lt;expression&gt; is fully evaluated. See Subsection 1.6. <p> Although function prototypes (new to the ANSI standard) are accepted by the interpreter, the arguments are not type checked or properly promoted when a function declared in such a manner is called. Instead, the default promotions take place. See Section A7.3.2 in Kernighan & Ritchie <ref> [KR88] </ref>. On many machines, no distinction is made in the executable's symbol table between functions declared with new style and old style parameter lists. The stab scanner does not create location symbols corresponding to linker symbols which are private to a compilation unit (See Subsection 1.2).
