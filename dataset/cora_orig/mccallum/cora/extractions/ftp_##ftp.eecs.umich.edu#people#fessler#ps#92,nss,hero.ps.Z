Abstract: In this paper we describe a method for computing matrix CR bounds for image reconstruction problems using an iterative algorithm that avoids the intractable inversion of the Fisher matrix required by direct methods. The algorithm produces a close approximation to the CR bound requiring only O(n 2 ) floating point operations per pixel of interest; an order of magnitude savings relative to the O(n 3 ) flops required by non-iterative methods. To illustrate the utility of our iterative algorithm we study a prototypical application: the dependence of achievable reconstruction accuracy on angular and radial sampling.

The ROI consisted of a single pixel at the center of the disks which was set to 1 in all three cases.

Reference-contexts: This implies that along the asymptote there is collinearity among the angular samples. However, this characteristic is object dependent; for Disk 3, the difference between 0:5 and 0:25 radial sampling was less than 4%. Huesman investigated the effects of radial and angular sampling <ref> [4] </ref> using an analytical approach that relied on the assumptions 1) that the noise variance is equal in all pixels, and 2) that the system matrix A can be represented by line integrals. The iterative method we have described can be applied to any system model or noise distribution.
