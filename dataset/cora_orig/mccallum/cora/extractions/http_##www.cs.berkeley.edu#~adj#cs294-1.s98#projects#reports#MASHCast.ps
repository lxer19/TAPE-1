Title: Performance Analysis of a Webcasting Application over Wireless Networks  
Author: L. Kristin Wright 
Date: May 11, 1998  
Abstract: Wireless connectivity is becoming more and more popular: cellular phones are nearly ubiquitous, roaming laptops are common, connected PDAs are emerging. Likewise, the WWW has enjoyed phenomenal success: it is almost true to say that if you use a computer, you use the web. As the Web becomes a must have resource, mobile computer users will naturally demand Web applications on their wireless platforms. In turn, web-oriented applications will need to address the unique performance and scalability requirements of wireless networks. We 1 have recently designed a webcasting application called MASHCast. MASHCast uses specialized SRM to distribute HTML documents in a scalable, reliable manner. In this paper, we will report the performance of MASHCast on wireless networks using real-time emulation. More specifically, we'd like to understand if our reliability protocol works and what the negative effects, if any, are on response time. We conclude that, for acceptable performance over wireless networks, the protocol requires one slight modification and, not surprisingly, the assistance of distillation proxies.

Reference-contexts: Complementing MASH's principle research goal is an emphasis on reliable multicast research and, specifically, the Scalable Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRM) [FJM + 95]. SRM was, therefore, the logical choice for our multicast protocol. In addition to providing reliable multicast capability, the ALF principles <ref> [CT90] </ref> embodied in SRM's design enables us to customize SRM to webcasting's unique needs. Explaining all of the SRM customizations we have made for MASHCast and the motivation behind them is beyond the scope of this paper. We will explain those that are relevant as necessary where warranted.

Reference-contexts: One of the group's priniciple research goals is to design, develop and deploy multicast-based collaborative applications. MASHCast is the webcasting complement to MASH's widely deployed video [MV95], audio <ref> [JS] </ref> and whiteboard [RT96] applications. MASHCast uses a customized reliable multicast protocol to distribute HTML documents in a scalable, reliable manner.

Although MASHCast can use SRM to multicast documents between the MASHCast applications themselves, communication between MASHCast applications and web servers is necessarily via the standard unicast HTTP protocol over TCP.

We have recently designed a webcasting application called MASHCast. MASHCast is part of the ongoing research project dubbed MASH - <ref> [mas] </ref> to develop a scalable multimedia architecture for distributed multimedia collaboration in heterogeneous environments.

Reference-contexts: In this experiment, we chose to emulate a Wave-LAN link so we configured the simulated link to have 2Mb/s bandwidth. The error model on Wave-LAN is complicated as losses are not independent <ref> [NaGNK97] </ref>. However, the average packet error rate is 2-3% [NNKS96] so to simplify our experiment we used a uniform 2.5% random error rate. 3 Both the error and data multicast channels are captured and injected into the simulation. Both channels, therefore, experience the 2.5% error rate.

Since MASHCast's target users are participants of a collaborative session, it is not very hard to imagine that some of those geographically disparate participants could be using wireless terminals of some sort.
