Abstract: This paper presents an approach to robot arm control based on exploiting the dynamical properties of an adaptive oscillator circuit coupled to the joints of an arm. The approach is implemented on a real robot arm, and swings pendulums at their natural frequencies, turns cranks and manipulates slinky toys. These actions are all achieved using the same architecture, without any modeling of the arm or its environment. The simple nature of the oscillators, and the lack of modeling results in a robust and very sim ple system.

Reference-contexts: To cope with this complexity, robots are often designed to be either very lightweight [ Salisbury et al., 1988 ] , use complex dynamical models <ref> [ An et al., 1988 ] </ref> , or are simply moved slowly. The system presented here exploits the interaction forces to communicate between the joints of the robot, giving coordinated multi-dof motion without any kinematic modeling.

Reference-contexts: Dynamical characteristics of the arm are exploited rather than modeled, allowing a very simple control scheme to exhibit a variety of interesting rhythmic behaviors. The system is implemented on the arms of the humanoid robot Cog <ref> [ Brooks and Stein, 1994 ] </ref> , which is illustrated in Robot arms are complex systems, with non-linear kinematics and dynamics. They interact with an environment that can also be dynamically complex, making the whole system awkward to model and control. <p> is then analyzed in more detail, highlighting how the dynamics of the arm are exploited, as well as providing biological evidence for the chosen solution. 2 The arms and the oscillators The two 6 degree of freedom arms used in this work are mounted on the the humanoid robot Cog <ref> [ Brooks and Stein, 1994 ] </ref> . The arms have been specially designed to interact stably and robustly with unstructured environments. Each joint actuator is force controlled, and consists of a series elastic actuator [ Pratt and Williamson, 1995 ] .

Reference-contexts: Each joint actuator is force controlled, and consists of a series elastic actuator [ Pratt and Williamson, 1995 ] . These provide low noise force control, shock tolerance and a provably stable interaction with passive environments <ref> [ Colgate and Hogan, 1989 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The system presented here exploits the interaction forces to communicate between the joints of the robot, giving coordinated multi-dof motion without any kinematic modeling. Humans also exploit the interaction forces, either by working with them to get smooth, approximately linear motion <ref> [ Flash and Hogan, 1985 ] </ref> , perhaps by using the cerebellum [ Uno et al., 1989; Kawato, 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: of options; one can model the system accurately and use optimization techniques to find the best ways to move (the approach of [ Uno et al., 1989 ] ), one can explore the system and remember good solutions, or one can design a system that exploits the natural dynamics directly <ref> [ Greene, 1982 ] </ref> . A further refinement is the ability to shape the dynamics of the whole system, so that "good" solutions are always used.

Reference-contexts: The crank turning does work, but is limited with respect to the size and the position of the crank. Robotic crank turning solutions (using hybrid position/force control [ Raibert and Craig, 1981 ] or impedance control <ref> [ Hogan, 1985 ] </ref> ) can turn different cranks in different locations, but require kinematic modeling and are thus sensitive to modeling errors.

Reference-contexts: This work is similar to the approach of [ Hatsopoulos et al., 1992 ] , although the oscillator system described in this paper has been extended to more applications. 4 Arm Dynamics The dynamical loads and forces experienced by even a simple arm are extremely complicated <ref> [ Hollerbach and Flash, 1982 ] </ref> , and for the biological system, with its non-linear musculature, the picture is even more complex.

During development [ Thelen et al., 1992 ] and during learning of a motor task [ Schneider et al., 1989 ] , humans learn to compensate for, and work with the interaction forces.

Reference-contexts: The natural frequency of the oscillator (w osc horizontal solid line) is 7 rad/s making the entrainment range about 60% One could find the best frequency to drive the system by using conventional system identification tech niques, and then driving at a fixed frequency <ref> [ Ljung, 1987 ] </ref> , however the behavior of the neural oscillators can achieve the same result without explicit computation. Figure 3 shows the result of a single robot joint driving a pendulum with different lengths and joint stiffnesses 2 .

Reference-contexts: Humans are remarkably adept at interacting with and perceiving the dynamical properties of objects [ Tur-vey and Carello, 1995 ] .

An alternative is to explore the dynamics of the individual systems, as suggested by [ Schaal and Atkeson, 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: The oscillator model consists of two simulated neurons arranged in mutual inhibition. The model for the neuron is taken from <ref> [ Matsuoka, 1985 ] </ref> , and describes the firing rate of a real biological neuron with self-inhibition: t 1 _x 1 = x 1 fiv 1 !y 2 j=1 h j [g j ] + c (2) t 1 _x 2 = x 2 fiv 2 !y 1 j=1 h j <p> For steady oscillations, t 1 =t 2 should be in the range 0.1-0.5, the oscillator having an output frequency w osc / 1=t 1 . A detailed analysis of this type of oscillator was published by <ref> [ Matsuoka, 1985; 1987 ] </ref> . The oscillator is connected to the robot joints by using the output y out to move the equilibrium point v .

Reference-contexts: In this sense the oscillators shape the dynamics of the arm to make them "good" in the task space. The crank turning does work, but is limited with respect to the size and the position of the crank. Robotic crank turning solutions (using hybrid position/force control <ref> [ Raibert and Craig, 1981 ] </ref> or impedance control [ Hogan, 1985 ] ) can turn different cranks in different locations, but require kinematic modeling and are thus sensitive to modeling errors.

He described "open loop stable" schemes for a variety of juggling tasks, which are schemes where perturbations to the system are corrected by the natural dynamics, without requiring any reactive corrections.

Reference-contexts: During development [ Thelen et al., 1992 ] and during learning of a motor task <ref> [ Schneider et al., 1989 ] </ref> , humans learn to compensate for, and work with the interaction forces. Humans also exploit the physical structure of the skeleton to reduce the forces at their joints when carrying heavy loads.

Reference-contexts: Whether this approach can be extended to different cranks in different positions is a question for further work.

There is no "set-point" for the control; the final behavior of the system emerges from the interaction between the oscillator and the arm dynamics, without any adaption of parameter values.
