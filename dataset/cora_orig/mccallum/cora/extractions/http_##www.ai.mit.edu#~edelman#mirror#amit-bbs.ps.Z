Abstract: A theory of representation is incomplete if it states "representations are X" where X can be symbols, cell assemblies, functional states, or the flock of birds from Theaetetus, without explaining the nature of the link between the universe of X's and the world. Amit's thesis, equating representations with reverberations in Hebbian cell assemblies, will only be considered a solution to the problem of representation when it is complemented by a theory of how a reverberation in the brain can be a representation of anything. It is possible (and, according to some, necessary) to distinguish two problems about mental representation (Cummins, 1989). The first of these, the Problem of Representations, is basically empirical, and has to do with the nature of the representations employed by a given cognitive system (such as the brain of a monkey). Amit's thesis, equating long-term memory representations in the monkey visual system with reverberations in certain cell assemblies in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex, outlines a possible answer to the Problem of Representations, mobilizing in support of the proposal an impressive battery of data from neurophysiology and from the mathematics of attractor systems. The target article does not, however, take a stand on the second problem, called by Cummins the Problem of Representation (singular). Here, the central question is how, in principle, can a mental state, as realized, e.g., by a reverberation in IT, refer to anything at all in the world (that is, what makes a given brain event the representation of, say, apple).

Reference-contexts: the head obeys a well-defined causal relationship with what is "out there" in the world (Locke, 1690; Edelman, 1995). 2 As an edifying example, consider Ijon Tichy's attempt to learn the meaning of the Ardrite word "scrupt," and its consequences, as recounted in the fourteenth voyage of the "Star Diaries" <ref> (Lem 1985, p.103) </ref>. 2 level, of the predicament of indeterminacy of radical translation, illustrated by Quine's celebrated Gavagai example (Quine, 1960). Stretching somewhat the sense of "footnote," one may consider this emerging neurophilosophy of representation as another footnote to Plato.

In Theaetetus, Socrates offers (and criticizes) a number of metaphors for the concept of knowledge, one of which is a flock of birds within the cage of one's mind.
