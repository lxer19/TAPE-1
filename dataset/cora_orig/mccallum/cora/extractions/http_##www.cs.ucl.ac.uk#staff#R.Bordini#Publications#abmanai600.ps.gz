Abstract: This paper briefly describes aspects of our project, which deals with adaptation to language and culture of a foreign society to which an agent is migrating. Regarding the former problem, we propose the use of meta-interpreters for the formal description of agent languages, and for the latter we are working on an anthropological approach to acquainting agents to foreign cultures. In this paper we remark that these ideas can have a strong impact on interoperation of Multi-Agent Systems, and we compare them to a major current approach to interoperability.

Reference-contexts: This is important from the social simulation (Castel-franchi 1990) point of view and increases the interest of cognitive science in DAI simulations. Further, we think that having different cultures and languages increases agent believability <ref> (Bates 1994) </ref>, because one could identify local and foreign behaviours of agents and the adaptation to the different cultures also creates believability in the sense that everyone expects that a foreign agent faces cultural problems, which are likely to compromise its general performance until an adaptation process has been completed.

Reference-contexts: However, we first need to pay some attention to how we propose to solve the problem of cross-cultural communication, as this will be important in the comparison of the approaches we present later. 3 The Foreign Language Problem In <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref> we have investigated means of allowing a migrant agent to learn the features of communication specific to a target society, so that it may become able to communicate with the agents from that society (see also (Bordini et al. 1995)). <p> Thus, allowing cultural variety in MAS relies on the assumption that migrant agents are able to learn different languages. This section briefly discusses the solution we proposed in <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref>. We have suggested some linguistic features to support the migration of agents between societies that have different communication mechanisms. In doing so, we are dealing with the problem of an agent entering any existing society whose communication features, in particular the communication protocols, are not previously known. <p> Two approaches were used for the formalisation (i.e., as meta-language): the deno-tational framework (using the notation in (Watt 1991)) and the structural approach to operational semantics (Plotkin 1981). We also showed, in <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref>, the communication features of a sample target society. These were specified with the protocol languages that we have formalised thus allowing a migrant agent to learn the particular communication features of that target society via the meta-language interpreter. <p> Furthermore, we have remarked that the immigrant agents must have access to some minimum meta-protocols allowing them to perform minimal interactions that lead to the learning of the protocols used in the target society. For the sample society in <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref>, two meta-protocols are specified: the first dealing with protocol version mismatches and the second with protocol exchanges among agents. <p> The initial implementation of a prototype of the communication sub-agent, which is in charge of adapting (in the level of language and interaction) the agent to the new society, was reported in <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref>. <p> This can be done in much the same way as proposed for language adaptation using formal, meta-level information in <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref>. Using universal meta-languages rather than universal communication languages (Bordini 1994) brings up a problem similar to that of distributed interpretations (Gasser 1995), where conveying the semantics of a message together with the actual message to be sent to some agent is not enough as it may become necessary to <p> This can be done in much the same way as proposed for language adaptation using formal, meta-level information in <ref> (Bordini 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We thus envision that Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can interoperate through agent migration among disparate agencies. Further, we think that it is important from a social simulation <ref> (Castelfranchi 1990) </ref> or a cognitive science point of view that each society is allowed some freedom to evolve its own particular language and culture, rather than to oblige MAS just to comply with some kind of engineering standard in order to allow interoperation.

However, the opinion that KQML could be used as a universal interaction language (Labrou and Finin 1994) has been almost a consensus (cf.

Reference-contexts: The initial implementation of a prototype of the communication sub-agent, which is in charge of adapting (in the level of language and interaction) the agent to the new society, was reported in (Bordini 1994). It was accomplished using ML-YACC <ref> (Tarditi and Appel 1991) </ref> and based on the idea that the complete de-notational semantics of a language can be viewed as an interpreter for it when used in a suitable functional programming language (Watt 1986; 1991). 4 A Contribution to the Critique of KQML We have so far sketched our ideas

Basically, the goal of Cognitive Anthropology is to discover the organizing principles underlying behaviour in unexplored societies in other words, how different peoples organize and use their cultures (Tyler 1969) and to apply somewhat formal methods in specifying theories for each particular culture. The general suggestion of providing formal models of each culture is particularly interesting for our work on computational societies. <p> Consequently, with the passage of time, a class of objects may be renamed, but the class of objects denoted by this name does not change, or, conversely, the class of objects denoted by a name may change, but the name does not. <ref> (Tyler 1969) </ref>. (This is, of course, additional to the obvious case of names changing due to changes in the environment). <p> Such a general theory will be equivalent to the language in which we describe cultures. <ref> (Tyler 1969) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Formal semantics was then given for both a (slightly improved) protocol description language presented in the literature (Populaire et al. 1993) and the protocol execution language we proposed. Two approaches were used for the formalisation (i.e., as meta-language): the deno-tational framework (using the notation in <ref> (Watt 1991) </ref>) and the structural approach to operational semantics (Plotkin 1981). We also showed, in (Bordini 1994), the communication features of a sample target society.
