Abstract: The resource-bounded measures of complexity classes are shown to be robust with respect to certain changes in the underlying probability measure. Specifically, for any real number ffi &gt; 0, any uniformly polynomial-time computable sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ; : : : ) of real numbers (biases) fi i 2 [ffi; 1 ffi], and any complexity class C (such as P, NP, BPP, P/Poly, PH, PSPACE, etc.) that is closed under positive, polynomial-time, truth-table reductions with queries of at most linear length, it is shown that the following two conditions are equivalent.

Q " <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; respectively. 3 Resource-Bounded --Measure In this section, we develop basic elements of resource-bounded measure based on an arbitrary (Borel) probability measure -. <p> We first review the well-known notion of a (Borel) probability measure on C. Definition. A probability measure on C is a function - : f0; 1g fl ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that -() = 1, and for all w 2 f0; 1g fl , -(w) = -(w0) + -(w1): Intuitively, -(w) is the probability that A 2 C w when we "choose a language A 2 C according to the probability measure -." We sometimes write -(C w ) <p> Examples. 1. The uniform probability measure is defined by (w) = 2 jwj 2. A sequence of biases is a sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ; : : : ), where each fi i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Given a sequence of biases ~ fi, the ~ fi-coin-toss probability measure (also called the ~ fi-product probability measure) is the proba bility measure ~ fi defined by jwj1 Y ((1 fi i ) (1 w [i]) + fi i w [i]) 3. <p> Note that, for A 2 E, the "point-mass" probability measure A : f0; 1g fl ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 0 if w 6v A is p-computable, and fAg does not have pA -measure 0. Thus, the strong positivity hypothesis cannot be removed from Lemma 3.2. We now come to the most crucial issue in the development of resource-bounded measure. <p> This section presents two very easy results identifying situations in which such probability measures are available. Definition. A probability measure on C is exactly p-computable if - : f0; 1g fl ! Q " <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and there is an algorithm that computes -(w) in time polynomial in jwj. Lemma 5.1. For every strongly positive, p-computable probability measure on C, there is an exactly p-computable probability measure -0 on C such that - t -0 . Proof. <p> For every strongly positive, p-computable probability measure on C, there is an exactly p-computable probability measure -0 on C such that - t -0 . Proof. Let be a p-computable probability measure on C, and fix a function ^- : N fi f0; 1g fl ! Q " <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that testifies to the p-computability of -. Since is strongly positive, there is a constant c 2 N such that, for all w 2 f0; 1g fl , 2 cjwj -(w) 1 2 cjwj . <p> It is clearly a routine matter to generalize further.) Definition. 1. A P-sequence of biases is a sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ; : : : ) of biases fi i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for which there is a function ^ fi : N fi N ! Q " [0; 1] with the following two properties. (i) For all i; r 2 N, j ^ fi (i; r) fi i j 2 r . (ii) There is an algorithm that, for all i; <p> A P-sequence of biases is a sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ; : : : ) of biases fi i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for which there is a function ^ fi : N fi N ! Q " [0; 1] with the following two properties. (i) For all i; r 2 N, j ^ fi (i; r) fi i j 2 r . (ii) There is an algorithm that, for all i; r 2 N, computes ^ fi (i; r) in time polynomial in js i j + r <p> A P-exact sequence of biases is a sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ; : : : ) of (rational) biases fi i 2 Q " <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that the function i 7! fi i is com putable in time polynomial in js i j. Definition. <p> For every P-sequence of biases ~ fi, there is a P-exact sequence of biases ~ fi 0 such that ~ fi t ~ fi 0 . Proof. Let ~ fi be a strongly positive P-sequence of biases, and let ^ fi : N fi N ! Q " <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be a function that testifies to this fact. For each i 2 N, let fi 0 21 and let ~ fi 0 = (fi 0 1 ; fi 0 2 ; ). <p> Lemma 6.1. If is a probability measure on C and (f; g) is a tt -reduction, then the function -(f;g) : f0; 1g fl ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (f;g) (C z )) is also a probability measure on C. The probability measure -(f;g) of Lemma 6.1 is called the probability measure induced by and (f; g). In this paper, we only use the following special type of tt -reduction. Definition.

Reference-contexts: Effective measure theory, which says what it means for a set of decidable languages to have measure 0 as a subset of the set of all such languages, has been investigated by Freidzon [4], Mehlhorn <ref> [19] </ref>, and others. The resource-bounded measure theory introduced by Lutz [12] is a powerful generalization of Lebesgue measure.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, suppose that a language A f0; 1g fl is chosen according to a random experiment in which an independent toss of a fair coin is used to decide whether each string is in A. Then classical Lebesgue measure theory (described in <ref> [5, 20] </ref>, for example) identifies certain measure 0 sets X of languages, for which the probability that A 2 X in this experiment is 0.

Reference-contexts: We first present some ter minology and notation on truth-table reductions. (Most of this notation is standard <ref> [22] </ref>, but some is specialized to our purposes.) A truth-table reduction (briefly, a tt -reduction) is an ordered pair (f; g) of total recursive functions such that for each x 2 f0; 1g fl , there exists n (x) 2 Z + such that the following two conditions hold.
