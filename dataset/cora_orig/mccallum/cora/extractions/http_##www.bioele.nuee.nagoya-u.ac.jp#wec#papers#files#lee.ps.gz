Title: Dynamic Control of Genetic Algorithms using Fuzzy Logic Techniques

Abstract: This paper proposes using fuzzy logic techniques to dynamically control parameter settings of genetic algorithms (GAs). We describe the Dynamic Parametric GA: a GA that uses a fuzzy knowledge-based system to control GA parameters. We then introduce a technique for automatically designing and tuning the fuzzy knowledge-base system using GAs. Results from initial experiments show a performance improvement over a simple static GA. One Dynamic Parametric GA system designed by our automatic method demonstrated improvement on an application not included in the design phase, which may indicate the general applicability of the Dynamic Parametric GA to a wide range of ap plications.

Reference-contexts: In this work, Grefenstette also optimized window size, generation gap, and selection strategy GA parameters. Several other researchers have proposed methods for dynamically controlling GA parameters. Bagley proposed encoding the meta-level knowledge, i.e. crossover and mutation probabilities, into the genetic bit string itself <ref> [2] </ref>. Many other schemes have been proposed that centralize the meta-level knowledge used to control the GA. Any technique which uses information not encoded into the genes is an example of this approach [13, 14].

Reference-contexts: The objective of the automatic fuzzy system design algorithm is to improve the performance of the GA it controls. In <ref> [4] </ref>, DeJong assembled a set of five functions to study the behavior and effectiveness of GAs as function op-timizers. The five functions were carefully selected to represent a wide cross section of function families.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows the proposed GA system. Inputs to the fuzzy knowledge-based system for GA control can be any combination of GA performance measures or current control settings and outputs can be any of the GA control parameters, such as the six mentioned in <ref> [7] </ref>. Example inputs might be (average fitness)/(best fitness), current population size, or current mutation rate. Rules in the fuzzy knowledge-based system can reason about these measures and prescribe some control action. DeJong and Goldberg have been researching the effects of population size on GA performance. <p> Later, Grefenstette used DeJong's test suite and applied a meta-level GA to optimize the GA control parameters. He gave parameter settings for best online performance (population size=20-30, crossover rate=0.75-0.95, mutation rate=0.0005-0.01) and best o*ine performance (population size=80, crossover rate=0.45, mutation rate=0.01) <ref> [7] </ref>. This was accomplished by measuring the online performance (o*ine in the case of finding best o*ine settings) of a parameter setting on each of the five DeJong functions. <p> To judge the fitness of the Dynamic Parametric GA, we used a similar procedure to <ref> [7] </ref> (see Figure 2). The set of five DeJong functions were used on a population of GAs controlled by fuzzy systems and the online and o*ine measures were used to provide fitness measures.

Reference-contexts: Defuzzification is the process of converting a fuzzy output variable into a crisp output variable. The system used in our experiments used triangular membership functions, the min intersection operator and correlation-product inference procedure. Defuzzi-fication of the outputs was performed using the fuzzy centroid method <ref> [9] </ref> A fuzzy knowledge-based system is an ideal way to represent a control strategy because the knowledge is in a form which permits both computers and humans to efficiently share it. <p> The rule base included 51 rules. The membership functions and rules are given in Figure 8 and Table 1. The system used in our experiments used triangular membership functions, the min intersection operator and correlation-product inference procedure. Defuzzi-fication of the outputs was performed using the fuzzy centroid method <ref> [9] </ref> For example, the fuzzy rule #15 of changing population size means: IF x 0 is big (A 0b ) and x 1 is medium (A 1m ) and x 2 is small (A 2s ), THEN change of population size is big (B 0b ), where each membership function and

Reference-contexts: For this reason, we decided to turn to an automatic technique, which has been demonstrated to be able to design fuzzy systems for other control applications <ref> [10] </ref>. In this section, we introduce the method for automatically designing fuzzy systems that was previously mentioned. We then show how to use this technique to design an optimal fuzzy knowledge-based system for the Dynamic Parametric GA. Figure 2 shows the diagram. <p> The number of rules in its rule base was also 51. 5 EVALUATION OF DYNAMIC PARAMETRIC GA To validate our findings we compared the simple static GA with our fuzzy controlled GA on the inverted pendulum control task <ref> [10] </ref>. Figure 9 shows the experiments evaluated. In this section we present results that demonstrate the feasibility of designing fuzzy controllers using the Dynamic Parametric GAs.

Reference-contexts: In a fuzzy system, each partition that a point belongs to contributes to the decision to the extent that it belongs to each partition. This mixing mechanism gives fuzzy rule-based systems their smooth interpolative behavior. Fuzzy sets are the building blocks of fuzzy knowledge-based systems <ref> [17] </ref>. Generally fuzzy sets serve to partition single dimensions. Membership of a point in a fuzzy set is allowed to be anywhere in the range of [0.0,1.0] and is determined according to a membership function. Common representations of membership functions are Gaussian or triangular shaped functions.
