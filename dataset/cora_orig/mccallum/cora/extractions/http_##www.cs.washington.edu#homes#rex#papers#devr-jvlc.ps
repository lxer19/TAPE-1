Abstract: This paper describes a visual database environment designed to be used for scientific research in the imaging sciences. It provides hierarchical relational structures that allow the user to model data as entities possessing properties, parts, and relationships, and it supports multilevel queries on these structures. A schema constructor interface allows users to define for each structure, not only its components, but also its visualization, which is built from its components using graphical primitives. Finally, an experiment management subsystem allows users to construct and run computational experiments that apply imaging operators to data from the database. The experiment management system keeps track of the experimental procedures developed by the user and the results generated by executing these procedures.

Reference-contexts: In a real system that stores hundreds or thousands of images, comparing an input image to the entire database is impractical. Most standard database systems use indexing mechanisms such as B-trees and hash tables to avoid large searches. Standard indexing mechanisms do not, however, extend to image content. Berman <ref> [2] </ref> has developed a method for organizing a database of images based on a known image-distance metric and a corresponding retrieval method that is able to eliminate many images from consideration based on their precomputed distances to a set of index images.

Reference-contexts: For an introduction, see the text by S.K. Chang [6]. A relatively recent system of his is discussed in [5]. Two other researchers, N. S.

Later, Brolio et al. <ref> [3] </ref> built a system called ISR (Intermediate Symbolic Representation) that interfaces to the symbolic structures used in their (VISIONS) vision system. At the same time, Goodman [11] developed a persistent object store for Lisp that provided integrated programming language and data management support for devel opment of knowledge-based vision systems.

Reference-contexts: The building block of the system is the hierarchical relational structure (HRS) which comes from the relational data structure of Shapiro and Haralick [25] that was designed for use in a spatial information system and extended for use in relational matching algorithms <ref> [4] </ref>. In the HRS model, every entity in the system (images, regions, edges, etc.) is described by a schema consisting of three components: properties, parts, and relations. The properties component of a schema is a table of attribute definitions; each entry specifies an attribute label and declares its type.

Reference-contexts: In addition to these general systems, a number of specific kinds of image matching have been developed <ref> [9] </ref> [22][19][15]. 2 DEVR is a general scientific database system motivated by the needs of researchers in the imaging sciences. It is closest to the work of Hachem et al and that of Smith et al in trying to provide a full information system, rather than a "query-by-content" facility.

Reference-contexts: The database itself is used to organize and store information about program graphs and results. The scientist uses a data-flow based visual programming environment (currently Khoros 2.0 <ref> [24] </ref>) to specify his algorithms in a declarative manner. This makes it easy to explore different algorithms by interactively modifying the data-flow program graph. The visual programming environment interacts with the database and the experiment management system using special input and output operators.

Reference-contexts: We have designed a system that lies somewhere between the two, an entity-oriented, hierarchical, relational database system. The building block of the system is the hierarchical relational structure (HRS) which comes from the relational data structure of Shapiro and Haralick <ref> [25] </ref> that was designed for use in a spatial information system and extended for use in relational matching algorithms [4]. In the HRS model, every entity in the system (images, regions, edges, etc.) is described by a schema consisting of three components: properties, parts, and relations.

Reference-contexts: If all nodes of the constraint tree are satisfied, a pointer to the candidate entity is inserted into the result set. 5.2 Advanced Queries The relations section of an HRS contains zero or more attributed relations over tuples of parts. These relations form a structural description <ref> [26] </ref> of the entity represented by the HRS in terms of its parts and their interrelationships. Two relational descriptions can be compared to produce a numeric quantity called the relational distance [28].

Reference-contexts: These relations form a structural description [26] of the entity represented by the HRS in terms of its parts and their interrelationships. Two relational descriptions can be compared to produce a numeric quantity called the relational distance <ref> [28] </ref>. Queries involving the relations must take in an instance of an HRS and return the set of HRSs whose relational distance satisfies a specified constraint. This ability to find good matches for structural descriptions of entities has been used extensively in our computer vision research [27][4].
