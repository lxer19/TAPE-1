Abstract: Advancements in storage technology along with the fast deployment of high-speed networks has allowed the storage, transmission and manipulation of multimedia information such as text, graphics, still images, video and audio to be feasible. Our study focused on the performance of the mass storage system for a large-scale video-on-demand server. Different video file striping schemes, such as application level striping and device driver level striping, were examined in order to study scalability and performance issues. To study the impact of different concurrent access patterns on the performance of a server, experimental results were obtained on group access on a single video file and multiple group accesses on multiple video files.

Reference-contexts: The experiments in this subsection study the capability of the disk array regarding to support concurrent accesses with acceptable quality of service. According to the experimental data from Ruwart et al. <ref> [8] </ref>, the throughput of one Ciprico RF 6710 RAID 3 can achieve 17:8 MBytes/sec when the request size is 4096 KBytes. However, it is still not clear what the performance of the disk arrays is when supporting concurrent accesses, which require constant retrieval data rate.

Reference-contexts: Basically, a single RAID 3 would be a severe limitation on the application environments where file transfers on the order of hundred of megabytes or more are becoming commonplace <ref> [9] </ref>. Given the availability of standard interfaces available on the disk arrays and high-end workstations, a natural extension is to employ multiple RAID 3 devices to achieve the necessary performance and capacity. We shall refer to such a system as array of RAID 3s in this paper.
