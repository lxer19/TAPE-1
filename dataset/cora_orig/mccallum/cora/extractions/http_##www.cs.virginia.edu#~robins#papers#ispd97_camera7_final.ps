Abstract: Previous literature on VLSI routing and wiring estimation typically assumes a one-to-one correspondence between terminals and ports. In practice, however (say, in a gridded routing regime), each "terminal" consists of a large collection of electrically equivalent ports, a fact that is not accounted for in layout steps such as wiring estimation. The presence of multiple ports for a given terminal gives rise to the group Steiner minimal tree problem. In this paper, we address the general problem of minimum-cost routing tree construction in the presence of multi-port terminals. Our main result is the first known heuristic with a sub-linear performance bound. In particular, for a net with k multi-port terminals, previous heuristics have a performance bound of (k 1) OP T , while our construction offers an improved k OP T . Our Java performance bound of (1 + ln k

In the rest of this section, we will show how to handle more effectively instances of the GSMT problem with some degenerate groups, i.e. groups of size 1.

The Group Steiner Minimal Tree (GSMT) problem <ref> [4, 10] </ref>: given an undirected weighted graph G = (V; E) and a family N = fN 1 ; :::; N k g of disjoint groups of nodes N i V , find a minimum-cost tree which contains at least one node (i.e., port) from each group N i . <p> a routing tree may connect to more than one port of a given terminal: here, the strong connectivity model applies. * Alternatively the possibility of rotating and mirroring a module also induces multiple port locations for a given terminal (for a general module, there are up to 8 possible orientations) <ref> [10] </ref>. These locations correspond to a group in the GSMT formulation. <p> Preliminary results appear quite promising and are discussed below. We compared our heuristic with the heuristic proposed by Reich & Widmayer <ref> [10] </ref>. Their heuristic begins by first finding the minimum spanning tree T for the entire set of nodes of all the groups. If a leaf node is not the last member of its group in the tree T , then it may be removed. <p> The heuristic then repeatedly deletes such a leaf node which is incident to the longest edge among all such nodes (see Figure 10 for a formal description of this algorithm).

We created each group by first defining a randomly-placed square area of predetermined size, and then uniformly and independently distributing nodes inside this square-shaped area. We varied the predetermined group areas among 10%, 50%, and 100% of the overall square routing region. <p> We varied the predetermined group areas among 10%, 50%, and 100% of the overall square routing region.

The remaining issue now is to combine the Steiner minimal tree over the degenerate groups with a tree spanning the other, non-degenerate groups. <p> We suggest the following Combined Group Steiner Heuristic (CGSH): first, we find the usual SMT for the ports of M 1 using the algorithm from <ref> [13] </ref>. Next, using our Group Steiner Heuristic (Figure 6), we find the GSMT for the family of groups that includes M 2 and a single arbitrary port from (one of the groups of) M 1 . Finally, we output a minimum spanning tree over the union of these two trees.
