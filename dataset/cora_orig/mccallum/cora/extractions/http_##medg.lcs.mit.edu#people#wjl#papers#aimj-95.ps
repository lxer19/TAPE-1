Abstract: We have added temporal reasoning to the Heart Disease Program (HDP) to take advantage of the temporal constraints inherent in cardiovascular reasoning. Some processes take place over minutes while others take place over months or years and a strictly probabilistic formalism can generate hypotheses that are impossible given the temporal relationships involved. The HDP has temporal constraints on the causal relations specified in the knowledge base and temporal properties on the patient input provided by the user. These are used in two ways. First, they are used to constrain the generation of the pre-computed causal pathways through the model that speed the generation of hypotheses. Second, they are used to generate time intervals for the instantiated nodes in the hypotheses, which are matched and adjusted as nodes are added to each evolving hypothesis. This domain offers a number of challenges for temporal reasoning. Since the nature of diagnostic reasoning is inferring a causal explanation from the evidence, many of the temporal intervals have few constraints and the reasoning has to make maximum use of those that exist. Thus, the HDP uses a temporal interval representation that includes the earliest and latest beginning and ending specified by the constraints. Some of the disease states can be corrected but some of the manifestations may remain. For example, a valve disease such as aortic stenosis produces hypertrophy that remains long after the valve has been replaced. This requires multiple time intervals to account for the existing findings. This paper discusses the issues and solutions that have been developed for temporal reasoning integrated with a pseudo-Bayesian probabilistic network in this challenging domain for diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: The temporal reasoning 1 enhances the performance of the task by applying the particular characteristics of time to the problem. The most prominent characteristic of time is the one-way flow with now occupying a single point. Such tools as Allen's formalization of temporal reasoning <ref> [1] </ref> give a functional understanding of such temporal properties as before and after. This paper will take a closer look at temporal reasoning in the service of medical diagnosis. Others have also incorporated temporal reasoning into medical programs to a varying degree.

Reference-contexts: Kahn recently provided a review of such efforts [7]. 1.1 Diagnosis Diagnosis is determining the cause of a pathological state. Often medical diagnostic programs simply generate a list of diseases that might account for the given findings <ref> [2, 5, 12] </ref>. Whether this is an adequate diagnosis depends on the purpose of the diagnosis. Most diagnosis is done in order to treat the patient. If the name of the disease is sufficient guidance for treatment, the job is done.

Reference-contexts: This solves one of the problems of associational diagnostic reasoners in that they tend to find diseases with some matching findings for which the overall combination of findings is inconsistent with the disease <ref> [3] </ref>. In a domain with a significant degree of uncertainty, diagnosis should be further characterized as the process of determining a set of one or more possible scenarios covering the range of likely explanations for the observed findings.

Reference-contexts: When a node is instantiated for a case, it is given a temporal interval, representing the observable time of the node. These temporal intervals have earliest and latest beginning and ending times, similar to the representation used in the CHECK system <ref> [4] </ref>. These intervals are used in a number of ways. The findings attributed to the node and the causes contributing to it are used to refine the limits of the interval as a hypothesis is built.

Reference-contexts: The strategy of duplicating nodes to represent different times has been successfully applied in the domain of diabetes therapy. In that domain the combination of diagnostic and temporal reasoning has been handled by having a copy of the Bayesian network for each hour over a 24 hour period <ref> [6] </ref>. In the heart disease domain, there are no well-defined convenient time periods to divide up the past, since minutes, hours, days, and years are often pertinent to the reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Thus, all of the nodes added to a hypothesis are consistent with the temporal constraints of causation. This time mechanism combines the ideas about reasoning with time outlined in our earlier paper <ref> [8] </ref> with the probabilistic reasoning described more recently [9]. 5.1 Representing the Example The following is a knowledge base fragment sufficient to cover the example MI and nitroglycerin problem. Not all of the temporal parameters are needed in this example, but it will give the flavor of the temporal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Because of this, the HDP uses a pseudo-Bayesian probability network. The knowledge base has forward loops in it, although any particular hypothesis does not. To reason with such a network, heuristic methods are necessary <ref> [9] </ref>. A probability network assumes that nodes are completely characterized by their truth (the conditional independence assumption that gives the network its power). <p> Thus, all of the nodes added to a hypothesis are consistent with the temporal constraints of causation.

Reference-contexts: Each hypothesis consists of a complete causal explanation detailing how the diseases and mechanisms in the hypothesis provide a consistent accounting for the findings. The program has gone through two evaluations, one when the reasoning was based entirely on a probability network <ref> [10] </ref> and a more recent evaluation after temporal and severity constraints were incorporated into the reasoning [11]. 2.1 Problem Domain The domain of the HDP is particularly challenging because it involves multiple interacting mechanisms operating over a variety of time periods.
