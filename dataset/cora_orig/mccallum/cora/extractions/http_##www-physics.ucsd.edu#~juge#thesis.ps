Reference-contexts: Its main focus is the electroweak and strong interactions between elementary particles such as electrons, quarks and gauge bosons to name a few. It is all part of what is known as the standard model which has been successful at describing the observed particles in nature <ref> [1] </ref> as well as predicting the existence of new particles that have now been found in high energy experiments. Most recently, the SU (2) isospin partner of the bottom (b) quark, the top quark, was discovered in 1994 [2]. <p> The general algorithm for the numerical integration is that of Miller and Olsson [31] but we shall use a second derivative that is improved to order a 8 . 4.3.1 Change of Variables The infinite range of r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is mapped into the region, s 2 [0; 1] using the following transformation, s = 1 + r=r s where r s is a parameter with dimensions of length which we shall often refer to as the scale parameter. <p> The general algorithm for the numerical integration is that of Miller and Olsson [31] but we shall use a second derivative that is improved to order a 8 . 4.3.1 Change of Variables The infinite range of r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is mapped into the region, s 2 [0; 1] using the following transformation, s = 1 + r=r s where r s is a parameter with dimensions of length which we shall often refer to as the scale parameter. This will typically be on the order of the radius of the bound system. <p> There are many observables that we can tune to, but we use the dimensionless ratio R defined by, R M 1P M 1S The value on the right hand side is the spin averaged experimental value taken from the Particle Data Book <ref> [1] </ref>. The singlet 1 S 0 has not yet been observed but O (v 6 ) NRQCD simulations [38, 40] indicate that the hyperfine splitting is on the order of 40 MeV. We choose 40 (5) MeV for the number shown above.

Reference-contexts: Most recently, the SU (2) isospin partner of the bottom (b) quark, the top quark, was discovered in 1994 <ref> [2] </ref>. Quantum field theory is the theory behind the interactions of elementary particles. Elementary particles are described by quantized fields that (among other things) have definite transformation properties with respect to internal symmetries which are called gauge symmetries.

Reference-contexts: QCD allows the excitation of gluons in a static quark-antiquark pair system which gives rise to a spectrum of hybrid potentials. These potentials can only be calculated in perturbation theory up to roughly Q Q separations of 0:05 fm where perturbation theory for potentials breaks down <ref> [3] </ref>. They can also be calculated analytically or numerically if one works within a given model of QCD. There has been SU (2) and SU (3) (for some levels) calculations of these potentials on the lattice [4-6] up to Q Q separations of ~ 1:3 fm in the past. <p> At very small r, the + g potential becomes the familiar running Coulomb law, which has now been computed in perturbation theory taking into account all two-loop O (ff 3 s ) diagrams <ref> [3] </ref>. However, the perturbative determination of the potential breaks down very quickly, below 0.1 fm, as r is increased. The fit form above is valid for separations above 0.1 fm. Hence, the e c parameter should not be confused with the running QCD coupling ff s (r). <p> The dashed and dotted lines are the same as in Fig. 3.24. 75 (r 0 )] against r=(2r 0 ) for all . Also shown are the hybrid potentials of Ref. [4] and the ground state potential for small r Ref. [28]. The two loop perturbative potential <ref> [3] </ref> is shown for reference. 76 g (r)] against r=(2r 0 ) for = u , g , g . Results from all of the simulations are shown; the different symbols correspond to the different channels. The pairs of solid curves indicate the continuum-limit extrapolations.

Reference-contexts: In these plots, the data from all of the simulations are presented in addition to the continuum-limit extrapolations. Results for the + u , g energies in SU (3) for r &lt; 2r 0 have been previously presented in Ref. <ref> [4] </ref>. Our results for these quantities have significantly improved precision. We have also 29 extended the range in r four-fold. The energies of all of the other channels were previously unknown. <p> These modes have energies which are multiples of =r and are a universal feature of any low-energy description of the long flux. The value of r at which one sees the onset of these modes is not known, but claims have been made <ref> [4] </ref> that string formation sets in even below 1 fm. However, the level ordering of the string states is not correct below 2 fm (Fig. 3.26). <p> The dashed and dotted lines are the same as in Fig. 3.24. 75 (r 0 )] against r=(2r 0 ) for all .

Reference-contexts: In this approach, the hybrid meson is treated analogous to a diatomic molecule: the slow heavy quarks corresponding to the nuclei and the fast gluon field corresponding to the electrons <ref> [7] </ref>. The first step in the Born-Oppenheimer treatment is to determine the energy levels of the glue (and light quark-antiquark pairs) as a function of the heavy quark-antiquark separation, treating the heavy quark and antiquark simply as spatially-fixed color sources. Each such energy level defines an adiabatic potential.

Reference-contexts: The calculations for the particle spectrum is intended for the bottom-antibottom (b b) system where we believe the quarks are sufficiently heavy for the adiabatic approximation to be valid. The phenomenological potential model approach was shown to describe the observed spectrum very well in this system <ref> [8] </ref>. Any detection of resonances that goes beyond our current experimental findings may signal the existence of a hybrid state even if they are not exotics. <p> One is that r 0 is defined precisely, r 2 dV fi fi fi = 1:65 (D.1) The choice of the constant 1:65 results in the value r 0 ~ 0:5 fm using phenomenological models such as the Cornell <ref> [8] </ref> model. The phenomenological potential in this range of r is well known because the b b or cc system has an average radius in this range.

Reference-contexts: the potentials out to 4 fm separations then would require a lattice size on the order of 50 4 which is ten times larger than the largest lattices used today! There has been proposals to modify the action to remove the O (a 2 ) errors in the lattice action <ref> [9] </ref>. This is based on the naive dimensional analysis of operators and is basically a method to cancel the O (a 2 ) errors at tree level expansion of the terms in the action. <p> Here we consider alternative actions that are improved in a sense that higher orders of a n errors are removed at this tree level approximation by choosing the appropriate linear combinations of the added terms. This idea of classically improving the action was introduced by Wilson and Symanzik <ref> [9] </ref> and these actions go by the name improved actions.

Reference-contexts: This (Symanzik) improvement of actions did not result in the desired improvement of gauge theory simulations for coarse lattices. It was found that this was mainly because of large tadpole lattice artifacts that can be seen to arise from the expansion of the link variables in a <ref> [10] </ref>. A combination of perturbative improvement and nonperturbative tuning of this tadpole has lead to the possibility of reliable simulations at lattice spacings as large as 0:3 fm for the static potential. <p> R is a 2afia rectangular loop with the longer side in the direction. Since this improvement scheme is only at tree level, renormalization effects can ruin the procedure resulting in very little gain. Lepage and Mackenzie <ref> [10] </ref> have suggested to further include nonperturbative effects in the improvement scheme by removing the tadpole lattice artifacts from the action. As was mentioned in Sec. 2.1.1, the link variables U (x) are 137 138 nonlinear functions of the gauge field A (x).

Reference-contexts: It is based on stochastic methods and is sometimes called Monte Carlo integrations <ref> [11] </ref>. 11 We wish to evaluate the correlation function in Eq. (2.17) or equivalently the expectation value of the Wilson loop. <p> Updating to the next configuration in the sequence happens with a probability which we shall denote as P ([U (i+1) ] [U (i) ]). This transition probability must satisfy a number of requirements for the configurations to form a Markov chain <ref> [11] </ref>. A Markov process has the properties that the sum of the transition probabilities and weights are both equal to one and that the strong ergodicity condition is satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, the Metropolis algorithm was commonly used to update the links in the gauge field. A more efficient algorithm that combines the heat bath and the over-relaxation algorithm was used in these simulations. The psuedo-heatbath updating proved to be more than twice as efficient than the Metropolis algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. The combination of heatbath and overrelaxation allows us to have an "independent" configuration within ~ 50 sweeps total for our coarse lattices. The heatbath step is a canonical updating step of a single link in a heatbath of the surrounding links. <p> The implementation of the heatbath algorithm for SU (2) has been introduced by Creutz [13] and has been extended to SU (3) simulations by Cabibbo and Marinari <ref> [12] </ref>. Their method is usually referred to as the quasi-heatbath method. The basic idea is to perform a sequence of heatbath updates on the SU (2) subgroups of SU (3) where the group Haar measure can be parametrized in the Pauli representation.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm for the generation of the random "hit" matrix has been improved by Kennedy and Pendleton [14] whose algorithm we shall use. The simulation code for the tadpole improved, anisotropic action was provided by Mike Peardon and Colin Morn ingstar <ref> [15] </ref>. 2.3.3 Over-relaxation Over-relaxation is a method that chooses the new links so that they are as far as possible from the original link without changing the action. <p> The couplings in the S II action depend not only on the QCD coupling fi, but also on two others parameters: the mean temporal link u t and the mean spatial link u s . Following Ref. <ref> [15] </ref>, we set u t = 1 and obtain u s from the spatial plaquette. <p> This was done in a two-step procedure. First, the M fi M matrices W ij (~r; t) were reduced to 3 fi 3 optimized correlation matrices ij (~r; t) (now i; j = 0; 1; 2) using the variational method described in Ref. <ref> [15] </ref>. This method determines those linear combinations of the M original operators which best overlap the lowest-lying stationary states in the channel. (~r; t) is simply the correlator matrix of these optimized operators. <p> We computed a s =r 0 for each simulation by fitting the ground state + g potential to the 3-parameter function, V 0 +e c =r+r, from which we extract a s =r 0 = p s =(1:65 + e c ) <ref> [15] </ref>. The results are given in Table 3.6. In obtaining the results of Table 3.6, a s =a t = ~ was fixed in all cases; the small radiative corrections to this relation were accepted as finite lattice spacing errors. <p> This term must be subtracted off to get the physical potential. 89 The hadronic parameter r 0 has been measured by many collaborations using different observables. The spread in the values is roughly r 0 = 0:46 ~ 0:48 fm <ref> [15] </ref>. We choose to estimate the errors arising from this uncertainty by calculating the spectrum using this spread. The b quark mass can then be tuned to the spin averaged (1S) without any further ambiguities. The angular momentum of the glue can be predicted within a given model of QCD. <p> The ratio of the spatial to temporal lattice spacings is denoted by ~ a s =a t . This anisotropy is inserted into the action at tree level giving the final form of the tadpole improved anisotropic lattice action <ref> [15] </ref> corrected to O (a 2 t ; a 4 s ), 3 ~u 4 + 3 u 2 t 1 sr s 1 ~ str s u 2 where sp = x i&gt;j 3 h y y i tp = x i 3 h y y i sr = x <p> However, the potential is well determined near r 0 and only requires an interpolation which reduces the systematic uncertainty. Further discussion of r 0 is detailed in the original reference. The scale has been computed <ref> [15] </ref> for different observables such as from various collaborations. The values collected in Ref. [15] ranges from 376 MeV to 434 MeV. <p> However, the potential is well determined near r 0 and only requires an interpolation which reduces the systematic uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: The total angular momentum ~ J g of the gluons is not a conserved quantity, but its projection ~ J g ^ r onto the molecular axis is and can be used to label the energy levels of the gluons. Here, we adopt the standard notation <ref> [16] </ref> from the physics of diatomic molecules and denote the magnitude of the eigenvalue of ~ J g ^ r by fl. States with fl = 0; 1; 2; 3; : : : are typically denoted by the capital Greek letters ; ; ; ; : : :, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Hence, it is important to use gluonic operators for which the Wilson loops attain their asymptotic form as quickly as possible. Variational techniques using a large set of different-behaving operators is an important ingredient in constructing such operators (see Appendix C). The single-link fuzzing algorithm of Ref. <ref> [17] </ref> is also an essential tool: gluonic operators built from fuzzed links have dramatically reduced mixings with the high frequency modes of the theory. <p> Every operator is made from spatial link variables that have been smeared or fuzzed <ref> [17] </ref>. This technique enhances the overlap of the operator to the state in question by reducing the ultra-violet noise from the link variables.

This mapping is then applied recursively n times, forming new fuzzed links out of the previously-obtained fuzzed links. We refer to the n -time application of Eq. (3.6) as a fuzzing scheme which we denote by (; n ). <p> the "staple-smeared" link, a 2 X n y + U i (~x ^ i)U j (~x ^ i)U i (~x ^ i + ^ j) : (B.3) We then take the linear combination of those staples with the original link and project the resulting matrix, M, back into SU (3) <ref> [18] </ref>. The projection into SU (3) is done by using the fact that the nonsingular 3 fi 3 complex square matrix M can be uniquely decomposed into an SU (3) matrix, V, times a positive definite Hermitian matrix, H, i.e. M = V H.

Reference-contexts: Binning of the data was done as a crude check that significant autocorrelations were not present in our ensemble of configurations. To reduce statistical noise, especially for large temporal separations, the static quark propagators were constructed from thermally-averaged temporal links <ref> [19] </ref>, whenever possible. The thermal averaging was done using the pseudo-heat-bath method (40 updates). Note that only links which are not directly coupled in the action can be replaced by their 21 local thermal averages.

Reference-contexts: To verify the restoration of rotational symmetry and to ensure that our on-axis results were free of non-physical artifacts associated with the roughening transition <ref> [20] </ref>, off-axis (r; r; r)= p 3 measurements were made in run C. Runs D, E, F, and G provided results for different lattice spacings a s ~ 0:27; 0:22; 0:19, and 0:19 fm, respectively. Only on-axis measurements were made in these runs.

Reference-contexts: The potential must usually be calculated with lattice spacings of smaller than 0:1 fm. In fact, there are recent unpublished results <ref> [21] </ref> that suggests that scaling violations are significant even at 0:1 fm for the excited potentials. <p> We focussed on the + g and u levels for this run since these are the potentials most relevant for hybrid phenomenology. This run was also important for resolving a slight discrepancy between our u results and those obtained using the simple Wilson action <ref> [21] </ref>. Unlike all of the other runs, only one operator was used in this run for each of the channels measured. <p> The B 1 and B 2 results (corresponding to the states) are shown separately in these plots. A close-up view of the u level for small r is given in Fig. 3.14; our results for a s ~ 0:12 fm are in excellent agreement with recent results <ref> [21] </ref> obtained using the Wilson action at fi = 6:2. 3.3.4 Continuum limits Our simulation results contain systematic errors arising from our use of a lattice regularization scheme. Such errors can be removed by extrapolating to the continuum limit a s ! 0. <p> The radial probability density of the u hybrid (Fig. 4.3) shows that the hybrid state extends out to roughly 1 fm. The u potential, therefore, must be able to support this without being "broken" by the light sea quarks. An unquenched lattice simulation <ref> [21] </ref> has indication that the potential is nearly identical to the quenched case up to &lt; 1 fm.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, only a minor change to our operator construction method is required to remedy this situation: the use of super-links <ref> [22] </ref> or blocking techniques. For lattice spacings significantly smaller than that used in run H, such modifications would be crucial. In run H, we chose instead to exploit the increased statistics possible when using only a single operator.

Reference-contexts: The hadronic scale parameter r 0 , defined in terms of the force between static quarks by [r 2 dE + g 1:65 was used for this purpose (Appendix D). The advantages of using this quantity to set the scale have been enumerated in Ref. <ref> [23] </ref>. We computed a s =r 0 for each simulation by fitting the ground state + g potential to the 3-parameter function, V 0 +e c =r+r, from which we extract a s =r 0 = p s =(1:65 + e c ) [15]. <p> first excited state using a two-exponential fit to the single correlator C 11 ( i (1) ^ O i (t) X a i y ) 142 143 Appendix D Hadronic Scale r 0 We set the scale of our simulation results using the hadronic sacle r 0 introduced by Som-mer <ref> [23] </ref>. There are several reasons to use this quantity to set the scale rather than to use the more conventional string tension p = 440 MeV.

Reference-contexts: Once the energy of a gluonic excitation lies sufficiently high above the + g potential, that level becomes unstable and can decay by emitting glueballs. The lightest glueball has J P C = 0 ++ and mass r 0 m 0 ++ = 4:33 (5) <ref> [24] </ref>. The dotted lines in Figs. 3.24 and 3.25 show the + g potential, shifted upward by the mass of the scalar glueball in terms of r 0 .

An unquenched lattice simulation [21] has indication that the potential is nearly identical to the quenched case up to &lt; 1 fm. Unquenched calculations of the standard potential <ref> [32, 33] </ref> with 2 dynamical quarks shows no sign of string breaking (the breaking of the QCD flux formed between the Q Q pair) up to Q Q separations of 2 fm.

Reference-contexts: An effective field theory with a cutoff below the mass scale m but above mv where corrections in powers of v 2 can be systematically included in terms of local operators has been developed by Lepage, Thacker and collaborators <ref> [34, 35] </ref>. This effective field theory is called NRQCD. In this approach, the relativistic QCD lagrangian is first expanded in powers of 1=m using the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The terms are collected in powers of v 2 using the power counting rules of NRQCD [35-37]. <p> The term (1a t H 0 ) can make the evolution unstable for large quark momenta since this term goes as (1 ~p 2 =m 0 ). The standard solution to this problem <ref> [34] </ref> is to replace this term by an expression that resembles an exponential, (1a t H 0 =(2n)) n and keep the bare mass greater than 3=(2n). The evolution equation (5.5) can also be symmetrized with respect to time.

We shall also call the 1 ++ a hybrid simply because the 1 + in a spin triplet is an exotic. The clover-leaf definition of the field strength tensor was used for the chromomag-netic field operator <ref> [35] </ref>. It was constructed using fuzzed links since this reduced the noise in the B field.

Reference-contexts: The fourth order derivative is defined as <ref> [38] </ref>, a 4 3 X h y i 2 We have used mean field renormalization of the gauge links in the propagator as was done for the glue action. <p> The singlet 1 S 0 has not yet been observed but O (v 6 ) NRQCD simulations <ref> [38, 40] </ref> indicate that the hyperfine splitting is on the order of 40 MeV. We choose 40 (5) MeV for the number shown above. The observed spin-averaged 1S 1P splitting is then nearly independent of the quark mass in the charm or bottom region. <p> This means that the simulated M 1S value is basically 2M b where M b is the renor-malized b quark mass. We have chosen eight sites on a given timeslice as independent origins for the propagators. The earlier study of the NRQCD collaboration <ref> [38] </ref> using the Wilson action has seen that the eight propagators are essentially decorrelated and can be considered to be independent measurements. We have also placed these sources on different timeslices skipping every 9 timesteps to increase statistics. Therefore, we have used 40 sources for each configuration. <p> Therefore, setting the scale by just using one or the other may not be appropriate in our quenched simulations. On the other hand, the nonrelativistic kinetic mass will have relativistic corrections to it and there has been claims that this effect can be as big as 10% <ref> [38] </ref> although simple estimates in the potential model do not exactly support this. Therefore, this may also not be the best choice to set the scale. <p> The splittings for the standard states are on the order of 500 MeV and so these errors are about 50 MeV for the S and P waves. There has been measurements with an order v 4 corrected action <ref> [38] </ref> whose results indicate that the v 4 corrections for the spin averaged splittings are actually less than 30 MeV for the P-wave and 10 MeV for the S-wave. 2.

Reference-contexts: The quark fields are smeared with a gauge-invariant local operator <ref> [39] </ref> to increase the overlap with the states. This smearing operator takes the following gaussian-like form, (1 + *a 2 ~ (2) ) n * (5.24) where * and n * are tunable free parameters. The arrow on the (2) indicate the direction in which the operator is acting.

Scale Ambiguity This is related to the above since the ambiguity in the scale is due to the disagreement between different observables in the quenched approximation. We have used r 1 0 with errors of roughly 5%.

Reference-contexts: There has been measurements of the heavy hybrid [43,44] (UKQCD collaboration) using the same leading order NRQCD action as ours. The two groups agree with each other but the results of Ref. [44] (Cambridge group) have higher statistics and smaller errors than those of Ref. <ref> [43] </ref> (Glasgow group). They have used the Wilson action for the gauge field and the results are difficult to compare to ours because of the uncertainty in the lattice spacings.

Reference-contexts: The scaling studies of the NRQCD collaboration <ref> [45] </ref> suggest that continuum physics is seen with a lattice spacing of ~ 0:1 fm. We believe that lattice artifacts are essentially negligible. The remaining difference is then the retardation effects coming from the covariant derivative in the NRQCD action.
