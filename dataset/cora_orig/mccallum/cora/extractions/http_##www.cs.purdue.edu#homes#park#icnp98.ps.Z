Abstract: This paper presents an architecture for multi-class quality of service (QoS) provision in wide area networks. Users or applications are assumed to be selfish and end-to-end QoS is determined by the service levels received by an application traffic flow at each router or switch along a path. In previous work, we have given a comprehensive analysis of the noncooperative multi-class QoS provision game for single-switch systems showing when Nash equilibria exist and under what conditions they are Pareto and/or system optimal. In this paper, we propose a specific network architecture for facilitating noncooperative QoS provision in many-switch systems such as the Internet with emphasis on realizability. We shield the user from having to choose the service classes on the switches along a route|a hard combinatorial optimization problem even assuming perfect knowledge about network state|while preserving the basic premise of selfishness. This is achieved by employing a set of QoS agents installed at routers which act on behalf of an user's traffic flow. The QoS agent intercepts packets entering a switch implementing generalized processor sharing (GPS) packet scheduling|and using only constant space packet header overhead and zero per-connection state at the routers|determines which service class to assign the packet to to satisfy the user's end-to-end QoS requirement at minimum cost. We present simulation results which show that our architecture is able to provide stable, stratified services to application traffic with diverse QoS requirements. fl Supported in part by NSF grant ANI-9714707.

Reference-contexts: The service rate of an output link is given by and we assume that the switch implements a form of GPS with service weights ff 1 ; ff 2 ; : : : ; ff m where ff j 0, j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and P m j=1 ff j = 1. Here, m denotes the number of service classes. We omit the link index for notational clarity. The total traffic entering each service class is denoted by q j . <p> User Model We are given n users or applications where each user i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> has a traffic demand given by its mean data rate i . <p> Thus, q j = P i ij . Each user is endowed with a utility function U i which indicates the satisfaction experienced by user i when receiving a certain QoS. Selfishness, in our context, will mean that each application i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> will try to take actions so as to maximize its individual utility U i . The forms for U i as well as user i's decision variables for the multi-class QoS provision problem are defined next. 2.3. <p> The forms for U i as well as user i's decision variables for the multi-class QoS provision problem are defined next. 2.3. Multi-Class QoS Provision Game We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. ij 0, i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, j 2 [1; m], denotes the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Hence application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. <p> The forms for U i as well as user i's decision variables for the multi-class QoS provision problem are defined next. 2.3. Multi-Class QoS Provision Game We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. ij 0, i 2 [1; n], j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, denotes the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Hence application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. <p> For the many-switch system, we will be particularly interested in the special case when traffic assignments are restricted to be unsplit-table: ij 2 f i ; 0g, for all j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Let fl = ( ij : i; j) denote the resource assignment matrix, and let c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c m be the packet loss rates of the m service classes. <p> Each packet loss rate is a function of fl, c j = c j (fl); j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. The model can be extended to the case when application QoS requirements are represented by multi-dimensional QoS vectors x 2 R s , s 1. For example, in addition to packet loss rate, x may specify delay requirements as well as restrictions on their fluctuations such as jitter. <p> The service class-QoS association table also contains a price column associating a current price p j for each service class j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Each packet entering a service class j is charged a cost of p j . <p> The pricing policy necessary for this to hold must satisfy c a c b =) p a p b ; a; b 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>: (2.2) We model users with step utility functions U i (c) = 1; if c i , 0; otherwise, where i 0 is a threshold that represents the i'th application's preference. <p> Finally, the SC Index (Service Class Index) field is used by the GPS switch as a key to its service classes. 3.2. Many-Switch QoS Provision Game Network Game Extension Fix user i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> and assume its traffic is assigned a route with r 1 hops or switches. We will use k 2 [1; r] as the switch index. <p> Many-Switch QoS Provision Game Network Game Extension Fix user i 2 [1; n] and assume its traffic is assigned a route with r 1 hops or switches. We will use k 2 <ref> [1; r] </ref> as the switch index. The user has a choice of r selection variables ~ k i 2 [1; m] where ~ k i = j indicates that user i has selected to channel his traffic through service class j at switch k. <p> We will use k 2 [1; r] as the switch index. The user has a choice of r selection variables ~ k i 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> where ~ k i = j indicates that user i has selected to channel his traffic through service class j at switch k. Let ~ i denote user i's service class assignment vector and let ~ denote the service class assignment of all users. <p> Network Game with Pricing Pricing can be introduced by imposing relation (2.2) (see Section 2.4), c k b =) p k b ; a; b 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>; (3.4) where c k j is the QoS rendered in service class j at switch k and p k j is its price. Thus the amount charged at switch k to user i's traffic flow is p k ~ k k i . <p> Theorem 3.6 (Many-Switch QoS Assignment) The per-user constrained many-switch QoS assignment problem given by (3.5) is NP-hard. The reduction to multiple choice knapsack is simple and elegant and a proof can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>; we omit it here due to space constraints. For a single switch system (i.e., r = 1), however, the optimal selfish user strategy of Section 2.4 yields an optimal solution to the constrained minimization problem. <p> When multiple QoS indicators (e.g., delay, packet loss, jitter) are present, then the self-optimization procedure selects the least costly service class that satisfies the QoS requirements of all QoS indicators. Figure 3.3 shows the basic protocol|also called Algorithm 0| executed by a QoS Agent at switch k 2 <ref> [1; r] </ref> upon seeing a packet belonging to user i. QoS Agent Protocol at Switch k: 1.

We refer the reader to <ref> [1] </ref> for a more complete exposition. 4.1. Simulation Set-Up We use the LBNL Network Simulator ns (version 2) as the basis of our simulation environment. We have modified ns in order to model our multi-class QoS provision architecture. <p> A service class assignment is then chosen such that this precedence condition is satisfied at every switch for every flow. A more detailed description can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. The reservation algorithm is used as a reference point in evaluating the relative performance of Algorithm 2. We observe that the former also satisfies the end-to-end packet loss rate requirements for all flows. <p> There are a number of performance results including adaptability to nonstationary changes, pricing and cost efficiency, user population diversity, multi-dimensional QoS vectors (e.g., delay and jitter), problem instance generation and robustness which have been omitted due to space constraints. We refer the reader to <ref> [1] </ref> for a more detailed exposition.

Reference-contexts: This paper complements previous works, in particular, our work on multi-class QoS provision in single-switch environments with heterogeneous user QoS requirements where game theoretic techniques were used to show when Nash equilibria exist and under what conditions they are Pareto and/or system optimal <ref> [19] </ref>. In this paper, we advance a specific network architecture for provisioning multi-class QoS in many-switch systems where desirable abstractions and features are crystallized, given practical realizations, and implementation and efficiency issues are emphasized. <p> A dual architecture capable of supporting reserved and stratified best-effort service is needed which, in turn, helps amortize the cost of inefficiencies stemming from overprovisioned resources for guaranteed traffic. Many-Switch Architecture Extending the game-theoretic analysis <ref> [19] </ref> to many-switch systems is a daunting task due to the nonlinear coupling introduced by switch interactions. Whereas in the single-switch system it was reasonable to assume that users had responsive access to the switch's internal state, in many-switch systems this assumption becomes infeasible. <p> Single-Switch Model: Overview Following is a summary of the single-switch QoS provision model which is necessary in understanding the architecture of the many-switch model described in Section 3. For a more complete description of the single-switch system including game theoretic results, we refer the reader to <ref> [19] </ref>. 2.1. Switch Model We assume a switch model implementing generalized processor sharing (GPS) packet scheduling. <p> For example, in addition to packet loss rate, x may specify delay requirements as well as restrictions on their fluctuations such as jitter. It turns out that the analysis of the multi-dimensional case reduces to the scalar case under certain conditions <ref> [19] </ref>, and we will proceed with packet loss rate c as the sole QoS indicator for illustrative purposes. <p> This is a nonlinear programming problem with equality constraints. 2.4. Relevant Properties In the following, we list some properties of single-switch QoS provision systems that are relevant to the construction of the many-switch architecture. In <ref> [19] </ref>, we show that Nash equilibria need not exist for the single-switch multi-class QoS provision game, and even if they do, they need not be Pareto nor system optimal. <p> Even when oscillations result without convergence to Nash equilibria, the resulting overall QoS allocation achieved was, in many instances, still desirable from the user QoS requirement point-of-view <ref> [19] </ref>. The switch state, at any given time, is characterized by a service class-QoS association table which tracks the QoS rendered at each of the service classes over a local time window. This table is continuously updated by the router and made accessible|i.e., readable|by the user.
