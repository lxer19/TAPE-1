Abstract: We transfer a neuronal model of the biological phenomenon of habituation, where repeated stimuli begin to be ignored, onto a mobile robot. Results demonstrating the validity of the model are given. Applications of habituation to mobile robots are suggested and areas of further research are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Habituation, the mechanism by which the brain learns to ignore repeated stimuli, is the most basic form of plasticity within the brain. It has been investigated thoroughly in recent years by biologists in a number of different animals, from the sea snail Aplysia <ref> [1, 2, 3, 5] </ref> through to cats [11] and toads [4, 14]. Of itself, habituation is an interesting phenomenon and therefore worthy of investigation, but there are several worthwhile uses to which it can be put. <p> This demonstrates that habituation is a two stage process, there is a short-term effect lasting for a few minutes and a long-term effect lasting for hours. For a more comprehensive review, see <ref> [1, 19] </ref>. Although habituation causes a decrement in response, the full response can be regained without allowing the animal to rest, for example by training with a different stimulus. This makes it different to fatigue. For a complete definition of habituation, see Thompson and Spencer [12].

Reference-contexts: For a complete definition of habituation, see Thompson and Spencer [12]. There have been several attempts to model the effects of habituation computationally and to explain the interaction between habituation and dishabituation, the process whereby an habituated response returns to its original strength. In 1970, Groves and Thompson <ref> [6] </ref> suggested that dishabituation was an instance of sensitization and therefore an independent construct which interacts with habituation to produce a net response. Their model was used by Stanley [10] to simulate data from experiments of Proc. TIMR 99 "Towards Intelligent Mobile Robots", Bristol 1999.

Reference-contexts: They found that there was a hierarchy of habituation, and that only stimuli further up in the hierarchy could dishabituate previously habituated responses. The most likely explanation for this (see Wang and Ewert <ref> [16] </ref> for more details) is that dishabituation is a return to normal behaviour and cross-talk between the habituation and dishabituation processes cause the failure of dishabituation. 3 The Biological Experiments The discovery of the habituation hierarchy mentioned above has been of very great interest to investigators. <p> A huge number of experiments have been conducted in attempts to discover why it exists.

Reference-contexts: In both, o = 20 and y 0 = 1:0. Unfortunately this model displays only the short-term effects. The first model incorporating long-term habituation was produced by Wang and Hsu <ref> [17] </ref>, who used these equations: o dt dz (t) = flz (t)(z (t) 1)S (t): (3) This pair of equations give an S-shaped curve which displays both short-term and long-term effects of habituation. fi controls the speed of habituation and the input S (t) is gated by being multiplied by y
