Abstract: For a wide class of stationary subdivision methods, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for these schemes to produce C k continuous limit curves. These stationary schemes include those arising from midpoint subdivision of irregularly-spaced knot sequences. We also describe a matrix method for computing various derivative schemes associated with such stationary schemes. Subdivision is a powerful tool for creating and representing complex curved shapes. Consider the process due to Chaikin [2] depicted in figure 1. A polygon is transformed into a new polygon with twice as many segments. For this particular transformation, the vertices of the new polygon are placed 1 4 of the way between the old vertices. Applying this process repeatedly yields a polygon with a great number of segments that closely approximate a smooth curve. What is this smooth curve? Riesenfeld [10] shows that the curve is a uniform quadratic B-spline whose control points are the original polygon. x1. Introduction

Reference-contexts: If the scheme has linearly dependent basis functions, several powers of two may be repeated. This result is a generalization of a similar result for uniform subdivision in <ref> [1] </ref>. Since the regular four point rule produces C 1 functions, we can now use theorem 7 to show that the irregular four point rule also produces C 1 functions. <p> If n is regularly spaced, then S [n] must be uniform due to affine and index invariance. Since the subdivision rules are locally defined and n has a single non-uniformity, only a finite number of columns of S [n] can deviate from the uniform case. For the uniform case, <ref> [1] </ref> and [6] show that the polynomial t can be reproduced by a vector that is a sample of a linear function over a regular knot sequence.

Reference-contexts: In this section and the next, we give direct conditions on S for the scheme to be C k continuous everywhere. This technique is a direct generalization of the method of <ref> [4] </ref>. We first establish conditions for convergence to a continuous function. <p> Proof: See theorem 3.1 in <ref> [4] </ref>. x7. Convergence to Smooth Schemes x7.1 Linear Parameterizations We previously showed that any stationary subdivision scheme that is at least C 1 continuous and that can produce functions with non-zero first derivatives at the origin must have linear precision.

Reference-contexts: Since the subdivision rules are locally defined and n has a single non-uniformity, only a finite number of columns of S [n] can deviate from the uniform case. For the uniform case, [1] and <ref> [6] </ref> show that the polynomial t can be reproduced by a vector that is a sample of a linear function over a regular knot sequence. Since this representation is unique (as assumed at the start of the section), l i must agree with the uniform analysis for large jij.
