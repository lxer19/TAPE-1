Abstract: In this paper we provide a simple model for musical sounds that accounts for timbre properties due to mi-crofluctuations in the harmonics of the signal. When considering a sound model that consists of an excitation signal passing through a resonator filter, we find, by means of higher order statistical analysis of the excitation, a grouping of sounds according to common instrumental families of string, woodwind and brass sounds. For resynthesis purposes we model the excitation by a family of stochastic, pulse train like functions whose statistical properties resemble those found in real signals. By introducing an idea of "effective number of harmonics" that represents the number of coupled, or statistically dependent harmonics among the complete set of partials present in the signal, we show that this number can be calculated directly form the 3rd and 4th moments of the residual. Musically speaking we suggest that microfluctuations administer a sense of texture within timbre and these texture properties depend upon the concurrence/non concurrence parameter of the random frequency deviations caused by the jitter.

Reference-contexts: There exists then a grey area in the border between texture and timbre and there is a similar border area between pitch (interval) and texture. This applies to wide range of other musical phenomena such as nuances of intonation <ref> [Cohen69] </ref>, "articulatory ornamentations" in non western music and random modulations in electronic music [Tenney and Polansky]. 7 Conclusion In this paper we presented an analysis-classification-synthesis scheme for instrumental musical sounds.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to timbre and especially in contrast to the interval the research on texture is scarce, although many contemporary composers refer to it <ref> [Cohen and Dubnov] </ref>. In tonal music texture appears mainly as an aid that may support or contradict the interval organization while in our days it has an existence of its own. Actually, most of the notation systems these days refer to texture phenomena.

Reference-contexts: the instrumental groups on 'orbits' with various distances around the origin, very much according to the traditional, orchestration handbook practice [Adler][Piston]. 2 Briefly we should mention that a common goal in a series of our works was to define a function that would sensibly measure the distance between musical signals <ref> [Gray] </ref> based on the bispec-tral information [Dubnov et al. 1995a]. In the current work we attempt to use the bispectral information for resynthesis also. (Top) and the bispectrum of the original Trumpet sound (Bottom).

The influence of jitter upon higher order moments is considered by its effect on harmonicity between har from the kurtosis so that the origin would correspond to a perfect gaussian signal. Brass sounds are on the perimeter.

Reference-contexts: The signal generators were implemented in csound with the parameters set in accordance to the jitter synthesis method reported by McAdams <ref> [McAdams] </ref>. The jitter depth was taken to be 0.01 of the partial frequency and the jitter spectrum was approximately shaped to have a -10 db cutoff at 30 Hz and a second cutoff to zero at 150 Hz.
