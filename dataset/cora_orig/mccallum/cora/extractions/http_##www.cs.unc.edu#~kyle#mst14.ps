Abstract: A central problem in wide area networks is to efficiently multicast a message to all members (hosts) of a target group. One of the most effective methods to multicast a message is to send the message along the edges of a spanning tree connecting all the members of the group. In this paper we propose a new fully distributed algorithm to build a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a generic communication network. During the execution, the algorithm maintains a collection of disjoint trees spanning all the group members. Every tree, which initially consists of only one node, independently expands by joining the closest tree, until all the nodes are connected in a single tree. The resulting communication topology is both robust (there are no singularities subject to failures) and scalable (every node stores a limited amount of local information that is independent of the size of the network).

Reference-contexts: In general, wide-area network applications (e.g., computer supported conferencing <ref> [1] </ref>, Internet audio and video multicast [13] etc.) employing sharing of information by agents located throughout an internetwork and belonging to disjoint logical groups have to consider the problem of efficiently propagating information to members of the same group. <p> As an alternative, we have designed and implemented an algorithm that, although is not optimal in the number of messages, is both simple and time-optimal. Our decision in trading the time complexity over message complexity is justified by the type of applications in the Internet <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref> in which the response time tends to be more important for the end users than the number of messages exchanged. 17 Practical solutions to the multicast problem were based on techniques previously used in distributed routing algorithms [18].

Reference-contexts: 2 and Lemma 5 we have directly the following result: Theorem 2 Given a graph G with n nodes the algorithm for constructing MST takes O (n). 15 4 Experimental Results We have implemented and tested the MST algorithm in the context of the XTV (X Teleconferencing and Viewing) system <ref> [2] </ref>. As part of this system we have used the spanning tree topology to interconnect a set of information servers that provide the backbone for distributing and advertising conference related information. <p> As an alternative, we have designed and implemented an algorithm that, although is not optimal in the number of messages, is both simple and time-optimal. Our decision in trading the time complexity over message complexity is justified by the type of applications in the Internet <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref> in which the response time tends to be more important for the end users than the number of messages exchanged. 17 Practical solutions to the multicast problem were based on techniques previously used in distributed routing algorithms [18]. <p> We have also proved that our algorithm is time-optimal, i.e., it takes O (n) to compute the MST of a graph with n nodes. To prove the viability of our ideas we have implemented the algorithm and tested it in the context of XTV conferencing system <ref> [2] </ref>. The main advantage of using a single tree per group for multicast delivery is that it offers a better scalability since a node needs to store only the information associated to its neighbors and not all routing information for all potential multicast sources.

Reference-contexts: Then, T and T 0 are joined only if L L 0 , otherwise T waits until T 0 is big enough.

While the theoretical importance of these algorithms cannot be disputed, their complexity make the practical implementation difficult.

Reference-contexts: Building the MST is based on the assumption that a node can determine the round trip time of a message sent to an adjacent node. The algorithm exploits Bollobos idea <ref> [5] </ref> of maintaining at all times during the execution a collection of disjoint trees (forest) spanning all the nodes in the initial graph; trees in the forest expand by being merged through edges of minimum weight until all the nodes are connected in a single tree, which is the final MST. <p> Thus the final sub-graph that connects all vertices of G is a spanning tree. Further, due to Bollobas <ref> [5] </ref>, we have the following result: Theorem 1 The spanning tree constructed by the algorithm described in Figure 1 is a MST of G.

Reference-contexts: We checked the correctness of our implementation by running tests ranging from three to twenty servers, with ten trials for each number of serves, and comparing them with the results of a sequential implementation of Prim's algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. To insure that the constructed MSTs were truly random, rather than allowing the vagaries of network RTTs to govern MST construction, we generated pseudo random RTT values.

Reference-contexts: The computation of the minimum bridge weight is based on the diffusing computation paradigm as proposed by Dijkstra and Scholten <ref> [10] </ref>. The root sends a COMPUTE message with the min bridge wt initialized to its loc min bridge wt (i.e., the smallest weight of an edge that joins the root with a node from another tree).

Reference-contexts: trials with twenty servers. 16 tests were conducted from two, up to twenty servers; for each number of servers ten trials were performed. 5 Related Work The previous theoretical solutions for distributed computation of a MST in communication networks are based on the algorithm developed by Gallager, Humblet and Spira <ref> [11] </ref>. The algorithm exploits the same idea; it starts with all nodes as sub-trees, and iteratively joins them along their minimum-weight edges until the MST is constructed. The algorithm has the message complexity O (n log n) (which is optimal) and the time complexity O (n log n).

Reference-contexts: Mainly, current existing solutions for the IP multicast architectures are extensions of distance vector routing (the Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol - DVMRP) [8] and link state algorithms (Link-State Multicast Routing Protocol [9]). A multicast extension to the Open Shortest Path link-state protocol was proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>. The main disadvantage of these schemes is the scalability problem: computing routing delivery trees is source-based, which requires every router, potentially involved in routing messages for all existing groups, to store routing information for all potential multicast sources.
