Reference-contexts: In the previous Physics Note <ref> [1] </ref> limits in the (M 2 ,) parameter space, obtained from the chargino and neutralino searches, were presented for tan fi = 1:5 and 35 [1]. These two tan fi values are theoretically interesting because the model is consistent with the measured value of the top mass. <p> In the previous Physics Note <ref> [1] </ref> limits in the (M 2 ,) parameter space, obtained from the chargino and neutralino searches, were presented for tan fi = 1:5 and 35 [1]. These two tan fi values are theoretically interesting because the model is consistent with the measured value of the top mass. <p> The luminosity is measured using small angle Bhabha events detected in the silicon tungsten luminosity detector. The charged tracks and shower energy clusters in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter and in the hadron calorimeter are selected as in <ref> [1] </ref>. At first the following four preselection criteria are applied in order to reduce background from two-photon processes. (P1) The number of charged tracks satisfying the quality criteria was required to be at least two. <p> For events with more than four charged tracks (N ch &gt; 4) and with no isolated leptons (category (A) of <ref> [1] </ref>) the following cuts were applied: (E1) In order to reduce events from two photon processes j cos miss j should be smaller than 0.9, where miss is the polar angle of the missing momentum of the event. (E2) The visible energy in the region defined by j cos j &gt; <p> Events with more than four charged tracks (N ch &gt; 4) and at least one isolated lepton (category (B) of <ref> [1] </ref>) were selected and the following cuts were applied: (F1) To reduce the contribution of events from two photon processes and Zfl events where the fl escaped into the beam pipe, j cos miss j should be smaller than 0.9, where miss is the polar angle of the missing momentum of <p> and on the ~- mass (M ~-L &gt; 43 GeV [11]) The light shaded areas show the LEP1 and LEP1.5 excluded region and the dark shaded areas show the additional excluded region obtained using the data from p s = 161, 170 and 172 GeV and the analysis described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The hatched areas show the excluded region obtained with the analysis presented here at 170 GeV and 172 GeV. The kinematical boundary for ~ + 1 ~ production is indicated by the dashed curves. <p> The kinematical boundary for ~ + 1 ~ production is indicated by the dashed curves. As can be seen in Fig.8, the region near M 2 = = 0 which was not excluded with the previous analysis <ref> [1] </ref> is now excluded. <p> Assuming gauge unification at the GUT scale, one can interpret the limit on M 2 obtained in <ref> [1] </ref> as a mass limit for gluinos using the relation of M ~g =M 2 = ff s = ff = 3:5. For a given value of and tan fi a limit on M 2 is obtained as a function of m 0 .

Reference-contexts: The interpretation of the results in this Physics Note is based on the CMSSM. In this model the squark, slepton and sneutrino masses at the weak scale are approximately given by the following formulae 1 <ref> [2] </ref>: m 2 0 + 6:09 m 2 Z j cos 2fij (1) ~u L = m 2 1=2 0:35 M 2 m 2 0 + 6:04 m 2 Z j cos 2fij (3) ~ d L = m 2 1=2 + 0:42 M 2 m 2 0 + 0:15 m

Reference-contexts: However, tan fi could be 1 These formulae cannot be applied for the masses of the stop, sbottom and stau, since these are affected by the large corrections due to f L -f R mixing. More accurate formulae of the sfermion masses can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 1 as small as 1.0. The phenomenology of chargino and neutralino production and decay changes drastically when tan fi approaches 1.0.

Z (fl) ~ 0 2 ! ~ 0 1 fl at centre-of-mass energies p s = 130 and 136 GeV <ref> [4] </ref>. The topology of events due to these processes is similar to that of e + e ! Zfl events except that the photon energy is smaller than in the e + e ! Zfl case.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is important to correctly incorporate the branching fractions of ~ + i ! ~ 0 (i; j = 1; 2). We have used the SUSYGEN Monte Carlo generator <ref> [5] </ref> to calculate these branching fractions. The simulated signal events were generated using the DFGT generator [6] which produces directly the four momenta of the six fermions created from a chargino pair production (including the spin correlations).

Since the W boson is quasi-on-mass shell in this parameter region, the W boson production and decay in the chargino decay cannot be treated independently.

Reference-contexts: The systematic errors on the number of expected e + e ! qq (fl) background events is due to the energy scale (7%), and to the modelling of the processes (11%), estimated by comparing the numbers obtained with the PYTHIA and HERWIG <ref> [10] </ref> generators. The error on the modelling of the processes is mainly due to the Monte Carlo statistics of the surviving events.

Reference-contexts: For tan fi = 4 and = 400 GeV, gluino mass limit of 270 GeV was obtained for large values of M ~q . Under these assumptions the limit is significantly better than that obtained from the direct searches by the CDF and D0 collaborations at TEVATRON <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. The CDF result is shown in Fig.9. In the region below the diagonal curve the lightest slepton or sneutrino mass becomes negative in CMSSM framework.
