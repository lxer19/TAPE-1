Title: A REVIEW OF TWO STATISTICAL MODELS OF KNOWLEDGE REPRE SENTATION, ACQUISITION, AND MEMORY  
Author: Rutvik Desai 
Note: May 1998  
Abstract: One persistent problem in cognition is how people acquire large amount knowledge on the basis of relatively little information they get. Some statistical models have been proposed which claim to at least partially present a solution to this problem. In these models, statistical analysis of large amounts of text is performed to produce a high-dimensional representation of words or passages in a semantic space. These representations are claimed to represent meanings of words or passages. I briey present two such statistical models -- Latent Semantic Analysis and Hyperspace Analog of Language -- and attempt to examine how much semantic information is present in their representations of words. The result suggest that while these models can extract valuable semantic information based solely on correlations in textual input, there may be significant deficiencies in the acquired meanings and something more may be necessary for human-level understanding.

Reference-contexts: Elmans Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) <ref> (Elman, 1990) </ref> is a connectionist model which does take word order into account. SRNs can separate words based on grammatical categories, such as nouns and verbs. While some semantic categorization is also present within each grammatical category, it remains to be seen to what degree is meaning represented by SRNs.
