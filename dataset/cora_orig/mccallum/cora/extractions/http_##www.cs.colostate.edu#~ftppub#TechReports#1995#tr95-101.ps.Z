Reference-contexts: One of the most efficient interconnection network has been the well known binary n-cubes or hypercubes; they have been used to design various commercial multiprocessor machines [Sei85] and they have been extensively studied. Very recently another family of regular graphs, called the star graphs <ref> [AK89, AK87] </ref>, are being extensively studied; star graphs seem to enjoy most of the desirable properties [QMA92, NSK90, QMA91, DT94] of the hypercubes at considerably less cost; they accommodate more nodes with less interconnection hardware and less communication delay. <p> Section 4 concludes the paper. 2 Basic Concepts In this section we briefly introduce the basic terminology about star graphs and identify certain structural properties of these graphs. Graph theoretic terms not defined here can be found in [Har72].

In order to generate a path from u to I, generators are applied in a particular sequence.

Reference-contexts: Star graphs thus are comparable to hypercubes also in the sense that the fault diameter is increased only by one over the fault free diameter. Although the measure of vertex connectivity correctly reflects the fault tolerance of systems with few processors, it underestimates the resilience of large networks. Esfahanian <ref> [Esf89] </ref> has emphasized and elaborated on the second point with respect to the n-cubes. Let us illustrate the point with respect to the star graphs. <p> Assuming that every fault set is equally probable, the probability that an arbitrary fault set of size n 1 will disconnect the remaining network is very small and gets smaller as n grows large. This motivates one to define the restricted connectivity or connectivity under forbidden faulty sets <ref> [Esf89] </ref>. In particular, for the n-cube, Esfahanian has defined each forbidden faulty set to be all n neighbors of one processor (thus there are 2 n forbidden faulty sets in an n-cube, each containing n processors). <p> Graph theoretic terms not defined here can be found in [Har72]. A detailed treatment of star graphs can be found in [AK89, AK87] and more details about forbidden faulty sets can be found in <ref> [Esf89] </ref>. 2.1 Star Graphs A star graph S n , of order n, is defined to be a symmetric graph G = (V; E) where V is the set of n! vertices, each representing a distinct permutation of n elements and E is the set of symmetric edges such that two

Reference-contexts: Esfahanian has shown that an n-cube, under the forbidden sets, can tolerate up to (2n 3) processor failures without being disconnected; Latifi <ref> [Lat93a] </ref> has shown that the fault diameter of n-cube under forbidden faulty sets is n + 2, i.e., the fault diameter is increased only by 2 over the fault free diameter.

Reference-contexts: Vertex connectivity of a star graph S n of dimension n (which is a (n 1) regular graph) is n 1 [AK89] and the corresponding fault diameter is b3 (n 1)=2c + 1 <ref> [Lat93b, RS93] </ref> (the fault-free diameter is b3 (n 1)=2c). Star graphs thus are comparable to hypercubes also in the sense that the fault diameter is increased only by one over the fault free diameter. <p> n ; consider those (n 3) of them that does not go through the nodes u or I; none of these paths can go through any immediate neighbor of the nodes u and I (since S n does not have any cycle of length less than 6; see [RS93] or <ref> [Lat93b] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Thus, the results add to the attractiveness of the star graphs as compared to n-cubes. Finally, it should be noted that the concept of forbidden faulty sets can be generalized where at most p (p 1) neighbors of any node can fail; details can be found in <ref> [LhNP94] </ref> where the generalized concept has been applied to the n-cubes. It'd be interesting to investigate star graphs in this generalized setting. The derivation of the fualt-diameter may be generalized to account for any number of faults in the star graph.

Reference-contexts: Vertex connectivity of a star graph S n of dimension n (which is a (n 1) regular graph) is n 1 [AK89] and the corresponding fault diameter is b3 (n 1)=2c + 1 <ref> [Lat93b, RS93] </ref> (the fault-free diameter is b3 (n 1)=2c). Star graphs thus are comparable to hypercubes also in the sense that the fault diameter is increased only by one over the fault free diameter. <p> It has been shown in [AK89] that the distance D (u) for a given node (permutation) u is given by: D (u) = + m when A is the first symbol + m 2 when A is not the first symbol Lemma 1 <ref> [RS93] </ref> For odd n, a node (permutation) u in S n is at the maximum distance b3 (n1)=2c from I, iff its cycle structure satisfies the following: (i) A is the first symbol in u (i.e. A forms a 1-cycle) (ii) All other cycles are 2-cycles. Lemma 2 [RS93] For even <p> Lemma 1 <ref> [RS93] </ref> For odd n, a node (permutation) u in S n is at the maximum distance b3 (n1)=2c from I, iff its cycle structure satisfies the following: (i) A is the first symbol in u (i.e. A forms a 1-cycle) (ii) All other cycles are 2-cycles. Lemma 2 [RS93] For even n, any permutation u has the maximum distance n iff its cycle structure satisfies one of the following two: (i) A is the first symbol in u (i.e., A forms a 1-cycle), three other symbols form a 3-cycle and the rest form 2-cycles, (ii) A is not in <p> The subgraph S 1 n1 is a set of (n 1)! nodes (each with A as its first symbol) and no edges. Consider the n 1 vertex disjoint paths (as computed in <ref> [RS93] </ref>) from a node u (with j 1 j = 1) to the identity node I; it is easy to observe that u; I 2 S 1 n1 and each 4 n of the n 1 vertex disjoint paths is contained exclusively in one subgraph S i n1 , 2 i <p> Obviously, if any of the substars S i n1 does not have any faulty node, we are done since there exists a path from u to I via that subgraph <ref> [RS93] </ref>. <p> In subcase A, each of the n 2 vertex disjoint paths in the subgraph has a length of D (u i ; I i ) + 2 (case of single invariant symbol, theorem 5 of <ref> [RS93] </ref>). <p> u i is reached by exchanging the only invariant ff i , nodes u i and I i have the same first symbol, and hence each of the n 2 vertex disjoint paths in the subgraph has a length of D (u i ; I i ) (algorithm A in <ref> [RS93] </ref>). Hence the claim follows. 2 Example 1: Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the two subcases with example nodes. <p> graph S n ; consider those (n 3) of them that does not go through the nodes u or I; none of these paths can go through any immediate neighbor of the nodes u and I (since S n does not have any cycle of length less than 6; see <ref> [RS93] </ref> or [Lat93b]). <p> Remark 5 Each of those (n 3) paths between u 0 and I 0 has a length of at most n + 1 <ref> [RS93] </ref>; hence the length of the surviving path between nodes u and I is upper bounded by n + 3. Remark 6 An interesting special case is when either u or I (or both) has only one good neighbor. Suppose u 0 is the only good neighbor of u. <p> Any of the n 3 vertex disjoint paths can require at most 2 non-optimal moves <ref> [RS93] </ref>; thus each of these paths has a length of at most D (u) + 6. <p> Then the nodes u 0 and I 0 are of the forms: u 0 = (ffi; A)()(!)(:::) and I 0 = (; A). Any vertex disjoint path from u 0 to I 0 requires at most one non-optimal move [see <ref> [RS93] </ref>]; hence any surviving path between u 0 and I 0 is of length at most D (u) + 4 and the overall path between u and I is of length at most D (u) + 6 n + 2. * n 3 D (u) &lt; n 1. <p> If it is the case that the neighbor of u which is reached by exchanging ff with symbol u (position I (ff)) is good,then ff = fi. Then we can generate paths to the nodes (fl; A) (fl 6= ff) inside the substar S ff as described in <ref> [RS93] </ref>. Again n 2 paths are generated to all neighbors of I, but (fi; A). Since any of these paths cannot be longer than n1 + 1 the total path between u and I is of length at most n + 2. <p> Proof : We have u 0 = (fi; ff)(x 2 ; A)(::) and in this case D (u 0 ) n by Lemma 2 and Lemma 1. If n &gt; 6, there exist (n 1) vertex disjoint shortest paths [use algorithm D of <ref> [RS93] </ref>] from u 0 to I. Consider the substar (of dimension n 1) S 0 with fi fixed at position I (ff); next consider consider the substar (of dimension n 00 = n 2) S 00 , S 00 S 0 , with ff fixed at position I (fi). <p> Consider the (n 1) vertex disjoint paths from the node u to the node I 0 (each of length at most n + 1 <ref> [RS93] </ref>); each of these paths reach I 0 via a different neighbor of I 0 ; disregard the two paths that reach I 0 via the node i and the node (ff; ; A); none of the rest of the (n 3) vertex disjoint paths can go through any of the
