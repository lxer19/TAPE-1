Title: Multi-parent Recombination  
Author: A.E. Eiben 
Affiliation: Leiden University  
Abstract: In this section we survey recombination operators that can apply more than two parents to create offspring. Some multi-parent recombination operators are defined for a fixed number of parents, e.g. have arity three, in some operators the number of parents is a random number that might be greater than two, and in yet other operators the arity is a parameter that can be set to an arbitrary integer number. We pay special attention to this latter type of operators and summarize results on the effect of operator arity on EA performance.

Reference-contexts: the parents blocks, but that exception has a very problem specific reason, therefore we rather present the general idea here. 1 In an extensive study on bit vector function optimization stochastic iterated genetic hill-climbing (SIGH) is studied and compared with other techniques, such as GAs, iterated hill-climbing and simulated annealing, <ref> (Ackley, 1987) </ref>. SIGH applies a sophisticated probabilistic voting mechanism with time dependent probability distributions (cooling) , where m "voters" (m being the size of the population) determine the values of a new bit-string.

Reference-contexts: In the experiments the values p = 7 and v = 5 are used and it "worked surprisingly well", but comparison between this scheme and usual two-parent recombination is not performed. An interesting attempt to combine genetic algorithms with the Simplex Method in <ref> (Bersini and Seront, 1992) </ref> resulted in the ternary simplex crossover. If x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 are the three parents sorted in decreasing order of fitness, then the simplex crossover generates one child x by the following two rules. 1.

Reference-contexts: At this time there are no experimental results available on the effect of within this framework. Related work in Evolution Strategies also uses as the number of parents as an independent parameter for recombination, <ref> (Beyer, 1995) </ref>. For purposes of a theoretical analysis is is assumed that all parents are different, uniform randomly chosen from the population of individuals.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the operators we survey here are called with a certain number of parents as input, and this number can be modified by the user. An early paper mentioning multi-parent recombination is <ref> (Bremermann et al., 1966) </ref> on solving linear equations. It presents the definition of three different multi-parent recombination mechanisms, called m-tuple mating. <p> Other conclusions seem to depend on the operator in question; the most consequent improvement for raising the number of parents is obtained for diagonal crossover. 6 Conclusions Applying more than two parents for recombination in an evolutionary problem solver is not a new idea, <ref> (Bremermann et al., 1966) </ref>. Several authors have designed and applied recombination operators with higher arities for a specific task, or used an existing operator with an arity higher than two, (Kaufman, 1967; Muhlenbein, 1989; Bersini and Seront, 1992; Furuya and Haftka, 1993; Pal, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Beyer hypothesizes that recombination has a statistical error correction effect, called genetic repair, and this effect can be improved by using more than two parents for creating offspring, (Beyer, 1996). A recent generalization of global intermediate recombination in evolution strategies can be found in <ref> (Eiben and Back, 1997) </ref>. The new operator is applied after selecting parent individuals from the population of , and the resampling of S i and T i for each i takes only these individuals in consideration. <p> It seems that if and when crossover is useful, i.e. on mildly epistatic problems, then multi-parent crossover is more useful than the 2-parent variants. on NK-landscapes with nearest neighbor interaction, N = 100, K = 1 (left) K = 25 (right). Recent investigation of <ref> (Eiben and Back, 1997) </ref> addresses the working of multi-parent recombi 7 nation operators in continuous search spaces, in particular within evolution strategies. <p> According to the latter approach each different arity is used within one subpopulation and subpopulations with greater progress, i.e. with more powerful operators, become larger. A first assessment of this technique can be found in <ref> (Eiben et al., 1997) </ref>. Concluding this survey we can note the following.

Reference-contexts: Comparing different biases in choosing the child allele, on four out of the five numerical problems fitness based scanning outperforms the other two and occurrence based scanning is the worst operator. In <ref> (Eiben et al., 1995) </ref> diagonal crossover is investigated, compared to the classical 2-parent n-point crossover and uniform scanning in a steady-state GA with linear ranked biased selection (b = 1:2) and worst-fitness deletion. <p> Two kinds of epistatic interactions, nearest neighbor interaction (NNI) and random neighbor interactions (RNI) are considered. Similarly to earlier findings, <ref> (Eiben et al., 1995) </ref>, the tests show that the performance of uniform scanning cannot be related to the number of parents. The two versions of diagonal crossover behave identically, and for both operators there is a consequent improvement when increasing r.

Reference-contexts: It is remarked that using majority mating and mating by crossing over the results were somewhat inconclusive; no definite benefit was obtained. Using mating by averaging, however, led to "spectacular effects" within a linear programming scheme. Scanning crossover has been introduced in <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref> as a generalization and extension of uniform crossover in GAs creating one child from r parents. The name is based on the following general procedure scanning parents and thus building the child from left-to-right. <p> The effect of the number of parents in scanning crossover has been studied in several papers. An overview of these studies is given in Section 5. Diagonal crossover has been introduced in <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref> as a generalization of 1-point crossover in GAs. <p> Here we give a brief summary of these results, sorted by articles. The performance of scanning crossover for different number of parents is studied in <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref> in a generational GA with proportional selection. Bit-coded GAs for function optimization (DeJong functions F1 - F4 and a function from Michalewicz) as well as order-based GAs for graph coloring and the TSP are tested with different mechanisms to CHOOSE.

Reference-contexts: The best option proves to be low selection pressure and high r in diagonal crossover combined with worst-fitness deletion. Motivated by the difficulties to characterize the shapes of numerical objective functions, the effects of operator arity are studied on fitness landscapes with controllable ruggedness in <ref> (Eiben and Schip-pers, 1996) </ref>. The NK-landscapes of (Kauffman, 1993), where the level of epistasis, hence the ruggedness of the landscape can be tuned by the parameter K, are used for this purpose. <p> There are also experimental results supporting differentiation among various multi-parent mechanisms. For instance, there seems to be no clear relationship between the number of parents and the performance of uniform scanning crossover, while the opposite is true for diagonal crossover, <ref> (Eiben and Schippers, 1996) </ref>. Another aspect multi-parent studies have to take into consideration is the expectedly different behavior on different types of fitness landscapes. As no single technique would work on every problem, multi-parent mechanisms will have their limitations too.

Reference-contexts: Using the value p = 0:8 the simplex GA performed better than the standard GA on the DeJong functions. The authors remark that applying a modified crossover on more than three parents "is worth to try". The problem of placing actuators on space structures is addressed in <ref> (Furuya and Haftka, 1993) </ref>. The authors compare different crossovers, among others they use uniform crossover with two as well as with three parents in a GA using integer representation. Based on the experimental results they conclude that the use of three parents did not improve the performance.

Reference-contexts: SIGH is shown to be better than a GA with 1-point and uniform crossover on four out of the six test functions and the overall conclusion is that it is "competitive in speed with a variety of existing algorithms". In the introductory paper on the parallel genetic algorithm ASPARAGOS, <ref> (Muhlenbein, 1989) </ref>, p-sexual voting recombination is applied for the quadratic assignment problem. Let us remark that the name p-sexual is somewhat misleading, as there are no different genders and no restriction on having one representative of each gender for recombination.

Reference-contexts: Recall the remark on the name p-sexual voting. The terms bisexual and multisexual are not appropriate either for the same reason, individuals have no gender or sex, and recombination can be applied to any combination of individuals. Gene-pool recombination (GPR) was introduced in <ref> (Muhlenbein and Voigt, 1995) </ref> as a multi-parent recombination mechanism for discrete domains. It is defined as a generalization of two-parent recombination (TPR). Applying GPR is preceded by selecting a gene-pool consisting of would-be parents. <p> In practice GPR converges about 25% faster than TPR foe ONEMAX. The authors conclude that GPR separates the identification and the search of promising areas of the search space better, besides it searches more reasonably than does TPR. In <ref> (Voigt and Muhlenbein, 1995) </ref> GPR is extended to continuous domains by combining it with uniform fuzzy two-parent recombination (UFTPR) from (Voigt et al., 1995). The resulting uniform fuzzy gene pool recombination (UFGPR) outperforms UFTPR on the spherical function in terms of realized heritability, giving it a higher convergence speed.

Reference-contexts: This might be related to another conclusion, indicating that for this problem mutation is an efficient operator and crossover might not be important. A so-called triadic crossover is introduced and tested in <ref> (Pal, 1994) </ref> for a multimodal spin-lattice problem. The triadic crossover is defined in terms of two parents and one extra individual, chosen randomly from the population.

Reference-contexts: Experimental studies on global versus two-parent recombination are possible, but so far there are almost no experimental results available on this subject. In <ref> (Schwefel, 1995) </ref> it is noted that "appreciable acceleration" is obtained by changing to bisexual from asexual scheme (i.e. adding recombination using two parents to the mutation-only algorithm), but only "slight further increase" is obtained when changing from bisexual to multisexual recombination (i.e. using global recombination instead of the two-parent variant). <p> The effect of operator arity for diagonal crossovers will be also discussed in Section 5.
