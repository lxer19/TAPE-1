Title: Fast Evaluation and Dynamic Control of Integrated Services Networks

Note: Abstract Title of Dissertation:  
Abstract: Integrated services networks, such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks, are expected to operate at gigabit per second rates and provide various virtual-circuit and datagram services. For this purpose, new control algorithms (e.g. scheduling, admission, routing) have been proposed. The algorithms are often adaptive, resulting in complex time-dependent interactions. This renders traditional evaluation tools ineffective; analytical approaches are typically too coarse, and simulation approaches are often too expensive. The goal of our research is to develop accurate analytical models that account for the interaction and time-dependent nature of the control algorithms, while at the same time being inexpensive or easy to solve. This would allow the rapid and tractable evaluation of different design alternatives. In this dissertation, we develop both dynamic models and quasi-static models of integrated networks. Dynamic models can be used to evaluate both virtual-circuit and datagram services. We solve dynamic models using a new iterative method, referred to as the Z-iteration. Our method is both accurate and fast. It permits the joint evaluation of various scheduling, admission, and routing schemes used in integrated networks. We show results comparing dynamic routing schemes on a network with NSFNET-backbone topology. We also illustrate the applicability of the Z-iteration to other high-performance systems. Quasi-static models are suitable for evaluating datagram services for which the quasi-static assumption is reasonable. We analyze a quasi-static model of a datagram network offering different classes of service. We apply the Liapunov function method to derive stability conditions for the routes of the different traffic classes. We show how with scheduling support for routing, the routes of the traffic classes can be isolated, thereby improving the overall network performance.

Reference-contexts: Routing can be static or dynamic. For dynamic routing, we assume routing information is updated by periodic broadcasts by nodes of the status of their outgoing links during the last period. This periodic collection of status information is often used in routing algorithms proposed for integrated services networks (e.g., <ref> [1, 8, 24] </ref>). We assume that broadcasts of all nodes are synchronized; we can easily model unsynchronized broadcasts. We also assume that these broadcasts reach other nodes instantaneously; this is justifiable because the time to propagate routing information is small 30 compared to the routing update period. <p> This solution is valid not only for exponentially distributed connection lifetimes [53], but also for generally-distributed lifetimes [55]. 2 Often referred to as effective or equivalent capacity <ref> [31, 59, 6, 44, 1] </ref>. 34 Assuming a simple admission control where the arrival of a new class-c connection is blocked if its admission would lead to a nonfeasible state, we have B r X If ( 1 ; ; c + 1; ; jC r j ) 62 F r <p> measure of the load on path p averaged over the last update period (discussed below), and F p is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the path p is feasible or not; a path p is said to be feasible if the source "expects" a successful setup on p <ref> [1] </ref>. 5 The ff s;c (t) can then be computed according to (5.4). Another design issue is related to how L p is defined. <p> We use here the ones that were considered in previous works (e.g., <ref> [8, 1, 17] </ref>) when selecting routes for connections. 5 The source would take into account the requirements of the new connection in addition to the current load on the path (assuming it is accurate) to test the feasibility of the path. <p> Figures 7.3 and 7.4 show the domains of attraction corresponding to isolation for TOS1 and TOS2, respectively, obtained by monte-carlo simulations for C 1 = 30; C 2 = 50; P 1 = 0:5; P 2 = 1; N = 20; M = 30; and ff k * <ref> [0:8; 1] </ref>. Theorem 7.1.3 also indicates that for small enough values of ff k , the system reaches isolation for all starting states and for all system configurations satisfying the necessary conditions for isolation.

Reference-contexts: At any instant, we describe the state of the network by the tuple (x; y), where x is the number of delay-sensitive connections on path 1, and y is the number of throughput-sensitive connections on path 1. To model routing updates, we use a discrete-time flow approach as in <ref> [12] </ref>. We assume that (some or all) connections periodically update their routes to the destination node every 4 time units, where 4 is long enough for the network to reach steady-state after a routing update.

Reference-contexts: See Figure 6.2. Delay U ( T ) UTIL TOS2 Our explanation is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [60, 42, 13] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources.

Reference-contexts: It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class.

Here, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider the following simple link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as TOS queueing. We consider two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput.

Reference-contexts: A guaranteed service provides bounds on performance. A best-effort service can provide qualitatively better service, but without the quantitative bounds of a guaranteed service [93]. The Internet Protocol (IP) currently provides only best-effort services. Extensive effort is underway to extend IP to support other services <ref> [16, 22, 93] </ref>. The focus of this and the next chapter is the provision of different type-of-service (TOS) classes of best-effort service. To offer various TOS requirements, e.g. low delay or high throughput, a network's routing protocol should be able to determine appropriate routes for each TOS class. <p> We would expect the same conclusions to hold. We also assumed a datagram (best-effort) service model of the sort currently used in the Internet. Extensive effort is currently underway to extend this Internet service model to support other services, including guaranteed service <ref> [16, 22, 93] </ref>. In such an extended service environment, our findings would still apply to traffic classes requiring best-effort service. In addition, our approach appears scalable as each router needs to maintain information only about each TOS class rather than each connection.

Reference-contexts: An example of such approach is the Rate-Controlled-Static-Priority approach by Zhang and Ferrari [106]. Otherwise, the traffic pattern has to be characterized at each link as in <ref> [89, 25] </ref>. Given the above assumptions, it is straightforward to obtain the parameters of a class at a link. Consider, for example, the parameters of class c2 at link r 2 R c2 = fh0; 5i; h5; 4ig.

This concept of isolating traffic classes using structured queueing disciplines has been used recently in flow control studies, e.g. <ref> [26, 58, 14, 89, 34] </ref>. Here, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider the following simple link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as TOS queueing. We consider two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput. <p> We consider two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput. Each node maintains two FCFS queues for each outgoing link, one for each TOS class. The link bandwidth is allocated equally between the two queues in a round-robin fashion. (This is similar to the fair-queueing discipline <ref> [26] </ref>, except that the link bandwidth is divided equally amongst the TOS classes rather than the connections using the link.) For any link, the link cost for delay-sensitive traffic is obtained by exponentially averaging the measured delay that is experienced by delay-sensitive packets only. <p> This leads to oscillatory behavior, which in turn degrades performance [60]. This is the case with TOS1 due to the use of the FCFS link scheduling discipline. In TOS2, because delay-sensitive packets have a lower queueing delay under type-of-service queueing <ref> [26] </ref>, the measured link delay becomes dominated by transmission and propagation delays. Thus, the reported delay link costs do not change dramatically and the delay metric remains a good indicator of expected link delay after updating the routes [60].

Each disk has a finite first-come-first-served (FCFS) queue where queries of different classes wait to be served. A query requests data retrieval from one or more disks in parallel. (See Figure 3.2.)

Reference-contexts: To keep these views up-to-date, each node regularly broadcasts the link costs of its outgoing links to all other nodes using flooding. As a node receives this information, it updates its view of the network topology and applies Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [28] </ref> to choose its next-hop for each destination and TOS class. (Using a more scalable mechanism to disseminate link costs would not affect our conclusions.) The method used to compute link costs for each TOS class depends on the link scheduling discipline.

Reference-contexts: It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class.

Here, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider the following simple link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as TOS queueing. We consider two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput.

Reference-contexts: Such simultaneous traffic shifts result in a bad performance, i.e. higher delay and network under-utilization. This effect increases as ff k increases. (In practice, ff k depend on several factors, and can be quite high <ref> [36] </ref>.) Consider the simple case where ff k = 1, for all k. It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 2 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes [30]. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class.

Reference-contexts: In addition, many current routing protocols use static link costs, typically configured by the network administrator and responding only to failures and recoveries. To our knowledge, only one approach to adaptive TOS routing has been proposed <ref> [38] </ref>. This approach, henceforth called TOS1, considers two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput. We refer to traffic of the former class as delay-sensitive traffic, and of the latter class as throughput-sensitive traffic. TOS1 uses measured link delays as the link costs for the delay-sensitive traffic (delay-based routing). <p> It uses link utilizations, or equivalently available link capacities, as the link costs for the throughput-sensitive traffic (utilization-based routing). In TOS1, each node maintains for each outgoing link, a single FCFS queue of data packets; that is, packets of every TOS class share this queue. Reference <ref> [38] </ref> refers to simulation studies but does not present any quantitative results. Traditionally, link queueing has been the FCFS discipline. It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class.

Reference-contexts: This is not, in general, true since the composite traffic contains blocked batch jobs returned immediately at the next time step to the system for retry. This assumption is less restrictive if blocked batch jobs are returned to the system after waiting an independent random period <ref> [80, 39] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we set the path-cost metric to the sum of the link costs along the path from the source node to the destination node and use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm as in <ref> [42] </ref>. (For each of these two path-cost metrics, it is easy to come up with static scenarios where it outperforms the other.) Regarding workload, this is defined in terms of hsource node, destination nodei pairs. In each pair, the source produces data packets to be delivered to the destination. <p> See Figure 6.2. Delay U ( T ) UTIL TOS2 Our explanation is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [60, 42, 13] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources.

However, the network may be under-utilized because of the potential loss of statistical multiplexing due to the static allocation of resources to VPs <ref> [49] </ref>.

Another area is to investigate policies other than the equal allocation policy for dividing the end-to-end QoS requirement among the links of a route. These policies would take into account the current link loads as measured in the last routing update period.

Reference-contexts: Henceforth, we refer to our approach as TOS2. Our discrete-event simulations on a subset of the NSFNET-T1-Backbone topology show that 41 TOS2 performs significantly better than TOS1 in a typical situation <ref> [52] </ref> where the proportion of delay-sensitive traffic is small compared to the throughput-sensitive traffic. As expected, TOS2 achieves a lower end-to-end delay for delay-sensitive packets since it effectively gives them higher priority. Unexpectedly, TOS2 also yields a lower overall end-to-end delay.

Reference-contexts: It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class. This concept of isolating traffic classes using structured queueing disciplines has been used recently in flow control studies, e.g. <ref> [26, 58, 14, 89, 34] </ref>. Here, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider the following simple link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as TOS queueing. We consider two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned here with next-hop (or datagram) routing, because it has proved to be a simple and robust way to do adaptive routing of best-effort traffic <ref> [78, 60] </ref>. Source (or virtual-circuit) routing on the other hand is often used for guaranteed services. Next-hop TOS routing is done as follows. Each node maintains for each destination node and TOS class, a neighboring node id, referred to as the next-hop. <p> See Figure 6.2. Delay U ( T ) UTIL TOS2 Our explanation is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [60, 42, 13] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources. <p> This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources. Consequently, at the next routing update the link reports a very low cost and becomes attractive again. This leads to oscillatory behavior, which in turn degrades performance <ref> [60] </ref>. This is the case with TOS1 due to the use of the FCFS link scheduling discipline. In TOS2, because delay-sensitive packets have a lower queueing delay under type-of-service queueing [26], the measured link delay becomes dominated by transmission and propagation delays. <p> Thus, the reported delay link costs do not change dramatically and the delay metric remains a good indicator of expected link delay after updating the routes <ref> [60] </ref>. This improves the performance of delay-based routing of delay-sensitive packets and results in more stable routes for that traffic class. Meanwhile, the link utilization metric makes the throughput-sensitive traffic move away from the delay-sensitive traffic, taking the under-utilized routes. <p> Ignoring low values of U (T ), UTIL also provides lower delays than TOS1. However, UTIL performs worse than TOS2 over the whole range of U (T ). This is expected, since the utilization-based metric does not necessarily result in minimum delay routes, especially at light load <ref> [60] </ref>. 6.3 Quasi-Static Model In this section, we consider a simple network model to gain more insight into the complicated behaviors of TOS1 and TOS2. We analyze the model in Chapter 7. We model a network by a source node sending traffic to a destination node along two paths.

Reference-contexts: However, it can be shown in simple situations that the approximation is accurate when compared to the exact instantaneous solution, and that the iteration is a contractive mapping of [0; 1) into [0; 1) and hence it converges to a unique fixed point <ref> [61] </ref>. We show this for the M=M=2=2 system with constant arrival and service rates. Accuracy of the approximation for the M=M=2=2 system From [98], we have the following exact instantaneous solution. <p> Figure 2.3 shows a graphical example of the mapping F . It illustrates that F is a contractive mapping of [0; 1) into [0; 1) and hence it converges to a unique fixed point <ref> [61] </ref>. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1B Output Trajectory 0 0.4 0.8 N ss = 1. 2.4 Related Work MCMR systems have often been analyzed under steady-state conditions (e.g. [53, 57, 70, 29, 92, 21, 80, 43]). <p> On the other hand, non-convergence indicates that the system oscillates between different routing patterns (or has chaotic behavior). Note that I is not a continuous mapping, and well-known theorems for convergence requiring this property cannot be directly applied <ref> [61] </ref>. We represent isolation by a stable state where every delay-sensitive connection stays on path 1, and every throughput-sensitive connection stays on path 2. This is equivalent to say that our iterative method converges to the fixed point (N; 0). <p> stability theory [86], we have the following theorem: Theorem 7.1.1 For TOS1, any starting state in D 1 (the shaded area in Figure 7.1) leads to the origin, regardless of the values of ff k : 2 The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [10, 61] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin.

Reference-contexts: which we readily obtain an expression for c = r c in terms of the N r c 0 and B r These two steady-state results are available for a variety of MCSR systems, including self-service systems where the customer is also the server, and single- or multiple-server queueing systems <ref> [63, 35] </ref>. We point out that the expressions do not have to be closed form and can be implicit. We make use of the concept of instantaneous fictitious offered load, originally introduced in [37], 6 to obtain instantaneous versions of the above expressions. <p> Let each admitted customer be served by one of the m servers for an average duration of 1= r c . Then S r c is the Erlang-B formula, i.e. S r c = E ( c ; m) = r c P m r c <ref> [63] </ref>: The instantaneous version of (2.1) is obtained by replacing B r c by B r c 0 c 0 c 0 (t), yielding B r c (fz r Details of step 8 The second steady-state formula, which we refer to as T r c , expresses U r c , <p> Thus, we get T r c in terms of the N r c 0 . For example, consider a self-service facility where the customer is also the server, as in an M=G=m=m queueing system. Assuming no blocking, we know that for the M=G=1 system N r c = c <ref> [63] </ref>. From this and T r c = c , which holds assuming no blocking, we have T r c = N r c . <p> Assuming steady-state and no blocking, we can treat the M=M=1=r.max system of r as an M=M=1=1 system.

In every scenario, the system behaves in a manner typical of open queueing networks <ref> [63] </ref>. That is, the throughput equals the workload as long as the workload is less than the system capacity; for workload higher than the system capacity the system is unstable. <p> Routes, and hence the network state, are updated at discrete time instants (k + 1)4, k = 0; 1; 2; . Let (x k ; y k ) be the network state immediately after time k4. At an update instant (k + 1)4, we use steady-state M=M=1 results <ref> [63] </ref> to estimate link costs based on (x k ; y k ). Using these link costs, routes are updated and consequently the new network state (x k+1 ; y k+1 ) is obtained.

Reference-contexts: It is important to examine both routing styles, evaluating the tradeoffs between admission control delay and network utilization. Large integrated networks (or internetworks) with nontrivial connectivity introduce scalability issues to the problem. Scalable solutions exist with both styles of routing (e.g. <ref> [11, 4, 2, 102, 64] </ref>). Future work is needed to examine such solutions and determine conditions under which each solution is effective. Multicast algorithms: Another issue to investigate is multicast algorithms, where the interaction among the control components is much stronger than in unicast.

Reference-contexts: It is obvious that TOS2 relies upon the delay-sensitive traffic being a small proportion of the overall traffic. When the proportion of delay-sensitive traffic is not small, TOS2 performs worse than TOS1 because the delay-sensitive traffic in TOS2 suffers from higher queueing delay than in TOS1 <ref> [72] </ref>. However, the performance of TOS2 can be restored by simply allowing, for example, the delay-sensitive queue to get two turns for every turn of the throughput-sensitive queue. The natural extension of this would be to give delay-sensitive packets absolute priority over throughput-sensitive packets.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned here with next-hop (or datagram) routing, because it has proved to be a simple and robust way to do adaptive routing of best-effort traffic <ref> [78, 60] </ref>. Source (or virtual-circuit) routing on the other hand is often used for guaranteed services. Next-hop TOS routing is done as follows. Each node maintains for each destination node and TOS class, a neighboring node id, referred to as the next-hop. <p> TOS2 uses TOS queueing. In all schemes, routing packets have priority over data packets; i.e. data packets can be scheduled for transmission only if there are no routing packets present. Regarding routing, we consider a link-state algorithm like SPF (Shortest Path First) used in the ARPANET <ref> [78] </ref> and OSPF (Open SPF) used in the Internet [83]. Each node maintains a time-varying cost (explained below) for each outgoing link and TOS class. Each node also maintains a view of the network topology, with a cost for each TOS class and link in the network. <p> We also give details of simulated scenarios and plots. Parameters All links have bandwidths of 1.5 Mbit/sec for the low-speed version, and 100 Mbit/sec for the high-speed version. Each node's outgoing link costs are updated regularly, with inter-update time uniformly distributed with mean 10 seconds <ref> [78] </ref> and standard deviation 1 second. 1 The factor b, used in the link cost calculation, is 0.8. 2 A data source is represented as a Markov chain with two states: a busy state and an idle state.

Reference-contexts: Because the class of a customer can be assigned when the customer arrives, it is straightforward to model state-dependent control policies such as assigning jobs to processors with the least workload. MCMR systems have often been analyzed under steady-state conditions (e.g. <ref> [53, 57, 70, 29, 92, 21, 80, 43] </ref>). In this chapter, we formulate a dynamic flow model [35] to account for transient conditions as well. <p> illustrates that F is a contractive mapping of [0; 1) into [0; 1) and hence it converges to a unique fixed point [61]. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1B Output Trajectory 0 0.4 0.8 N ss = 1. 2.4 Related Work MCMR systems have often been analyzed under steady-state conditions (e.g. <ref> [53, 57, 70, 29, 92, 21, 80, 43] </ref>). In this chapter, we formulated a dynamic flow model [35] to account for transient conditions as well. <p> This is not, in general, true since the composite traffic contains blocked batch jobs returned immediately at the next time step to the system for retry. This assumption is less restrictive if blocked batch jobs are returned to the system after waiting an independent random period <ref> [80, 39] </ref>. This waiting effect can be easily incorporated into the above model.

Reference-contexts: One such method is that of time-dependent queueing models, which involve probability distributions for all events.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, admission control is much faster with VP based routing than with Internet-style routing. However, the network may be under-utilized because of the potential loss of statistical multiplexing due to the static allocation of resources to VPs [49]. This has led to attempts to dynamically allocate resources to VPs <ref> [88] </ref>. However, depending on the rate at which the VP resource allocations are varied compared to traffic demands, this approach may not be effective or may give rise to massive instability because of the strong interaction between VP resource allocation and routing/admission control.

Reference-contexts: We use the Z-iteration to study the performance of an integrated network with NSFNET backbone topology, weighted fair-queueing link scheduling <ref> [89] </ref>, admission control based on "effective bandwidth" [44], and various virtual-circuit routing schemes that adapt to delayed state information expressed in terms of link utilizations. 2 Quasi-Static Evaluation The Z-iteration can be used to solve dynamic models that capture the general time-varying behavior of integrated networks offering both virtual-circuit and datagram <p> An example of such approach is the Rate-Controlled-Static-Priority approach by Zhang and Ferrari [106]. Otherwise, the traffic pattern has to be characterized at each link as in <ref> [89, 25] </ref>. Given the above assumptions, it is straightforward to obtain the parameters of a class at a link. Consider, for example, the parameters of class c2 at link r 2 R c2 = fh0; 5i; h5; 4ig. <p> In the following, we illustrate the computation of F r for a "per-connection" link scheduling algorithm of the weighted round-robin type. An example of this type of scheduling algorithms is weighted fair-queueing <ref> [89] </ref>. Here, each class-c connection is allocated (and guaranteed) a certain amount of bandwidth on link r 2 R c that is enough to satisfy its local QoS requirement. This required bandwidth depends of course on the local QoS and the packet generation characteristics of the connection. <p> It appears desirable to use a more structured queueing discipline that helps "isolate" the different TOS classes, for example, by using a separate queue for each TOS class. This concept of isolating traffic classes using structured queueing disciplines has been used recently in flow control studies, e.g. <ref> [26, 58, 14, 89, 34] </ref>. Here, we investigate the use of a structured queueing discipline with adaptive next-hop TOS routing. Our approach We consider the following simple link scheduling discipline, henceforth referred to as TOS queueing. We consider two TOS classes: low delay and high throughput.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Integrated services packet-switched networks, such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks <ref> [91] </ref>, are expected to support a wide variety of applications (e.g., multimedia, voice, mail) with heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To meet these requirements, new algorithms have been proposed for controlling routing, admission, and scheduling. Routing provides a selection of routes, based on cost functions associated with the transmission links.

We also assumed a datagram (best-effort) service model of the sort currently used in the Internet. Extensive effort is currently underway to extend this Internet service model to support other services, including guaranteed service <ref> [16, 22, 93] </ref>. In such an extended service environment, our findings would still apply to traffic classes requiring best-effort service. In addition, our approach appears scalable as each router needs to maintain information only about each TOS class rather than each connection.

One such method is that of time-dependent queueing models, which involve probability distributions for all events. However, such models are extremely difficult to solve analytically [101], and computationally expensive to solve numerically <ref> [100] </ref>; A second method is that of diffusion models, which utilize averages and variances [19, 84]. Such models involve partial differential equations and are usually intractable. A third method is that of fluid models, which utilize average quantities only [15]. Such models involve ordinary differential equations and are usually tractable.

Reference-contexts: It is important to examine both routing styles, evaluating the tradeoffs between admission control delay and network utilization. Large integrated networks (or internetworks) with nontrivial connectivity introduce scalability issues to the problem. Scalable solutions exist with both styles of routing (e.g. <ref> [11, 4, 2, 102, 64] </ref>). Future work is needed to examine such solutions and determine conditions under which each solution is effective. Multicast algorithms: Another issue to investigate is multicast algorithms, where the interaction among the control components is much stronger than in unicast.

Reference-contexts: Henceforth we assume that a connection of service s requests an end-to-end statistical delay bound (D s ; " s ), where the delay does not include the propagation delay. This QoS requirement is 33 also referred to as packet jitter <ref> [33, 103] </ref>. This is typically required by applications such as voice since they can tolerate some packet loss (a packet is considered lost if its delay exceeds D s ) [32, 33].

Reference-contexts: Another area is to examine admission controls, other than the complete-sharing policy, that block some connection setup requests even if their admission is feasible, possibly in order to reduce the chance of future blocking of connections of other types. In this case, blocking would occur at more feasible states <ref> [104, 50] </ref>. Another area is to investigate policies other than the equal allocation policy for dividing the end-to-end QoS requirement among the links of a route. These policies would take into account the current link loads as measured in the last routing update period.

Reference-contexts: It is also valid if the network uses a tightly-controlled approach that uses a non-work-conserving link scheduling discipline to reconstruct the traffic pattern at each link. An example of such approach is the Rate-Controlled-Static-Priority approach by Zhang and Ferrari <ref> [106] </ref>. Otherwise, the traffic pattern has to be characterized at each link as in [89, 25]. Given the above assumptions, it is straightforward to obtain the parameters of a class at a link.

Reference-contexts: The source then stays idle for an exponentially distributed duration before starting the transmission of the next train (burst) of packets. (This traffic model has been used in many studies, e.g. <ref> [107] </ref>.) Unless otherwise indicated, all sources have the following parameters: for the low-speed case, the data packet length equals 128 bytes, the inter-packet generation time is 150 msec, the average train size is 100 packets, and the average idle duration is 2 seconds (this corresponds to an average packet rate of

Reference-contexts: A number of approximate solutions for such systems, referred to as 1-limited polling systems, have been proposed. (See [99] for a good survey.) One common approach is to approximate the system by two loosely-coupled M=M=1 queues <ref> [81, 108] </ref>. The service rate of each queue depends on the utilization of the other queue. Define C eff i;k as the effective capacity available for the delay-sensitive traffic on path i after time k4.

Reference-contexts: Future work remains to similarly analyze such situations and propose a scheduling discipline that dynamically allocates turns to the TOS queues based on traffic estimates. There might be other possible approaches to adaptive next-hop TOS routing. One approach <ref> [109] </ref> is to maintain for delay-sensitive traffic two minimum propagation delay routes and use the secondary route when the primary route becomes congested.
