Abstract: Recently, a number of small yet powerful mobile computers have appeared on the market. Endowed with large disk capacity and network hardware, such systems are capable of holding large amounts of data, as well as of exchanging information with other hosts on a distributed system. These features suggest the need for the design and implementation of a distributed database system for mobile computers. Such mobile database systems present a host of technical challenges. One of them is dealing with the limited battery capacity of current mobile machines. We investigate the possibility of increasing the effective battery life of these computers by selecting energy-efficient query plans during query optimization. In this paper we review the capabilities of mobile computers and describe the power management issues in such systems. We examine the case of database systems on stand-alone mobile computers, and conclude that only a small modification is needed in standard query optimizers. However, the situation is far different when the mobile client interacts with a database server. In such a case, the appropriate optimization criterion involves optimization along two different axes, namely energy spent by the client, and overall server throughput. Optimization criteria that address the above point do not satisfy the basic assumption of the dynamic programming algorithm which lies at the center of most commercial op-timizers. This forces the consideration of dynamic programming algorithms with partial orders. We present two novel two-dimensional dynamic programming search algorithms for query optimization in mobile databases. We also discuss a new approximate opti mization algorithm for this problem.

For example, new interfaces better suited for the smaller screens of these machines are required, especially interfaces that support the pen-centric capabilities of many mobile computers. (See <ref> [1] </ref> for a description of a prototype interface for mobile databases.)

Reference-contexts: The interaction between degree of replication and mobility patterns is investigated in [4].

For a short summary of research problems in mobile database we refer the reader to <ref> [2] </ref>. A new type of problem that appears in mobile systems is due to these machines' reliance on portable energy sources. Mobile computers rely on battery power, and this places limits on their effective usability.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 1, we list the energy costs of some basic database operations in terms of joules. These figures are obtained from the specifications of a typical state of the art portable computer developed by AMD <ref> [3] </ref>. However, in order to better understand the relation between optimizing for energy and optimizing for total work, it is more revealing to formulate energy costs in terms of time spent on the individual resources multiplied by the power consumption (in watts) of the resources.

Reference-contexts: Other examples of labels are access path, create index, and eliminate duplicates. In this paper, we assume that for a centralized evaluation, the set of annotations are the same as that considered in [14]. For a distributed evaluation, we follow the set of annotations considered in <ref> [5] </ref>. Optimization Criterion: Commercial DBMSs are built for optimal throughput and therefore the optimization criteria is minimizing total work (i.e., total resource consumption).

Reference-contexts: This will appear so especially to computer scientists, who have become accustomed to expect exponential improvement in many of the performance parameters of computer systems. However, battery experts' predictions call for only a modest improvement over the next few years in battery power capacity. For example, one estimate <ref> [6] </ref> is that battery life will increase by only 30% over the next five years. If better battery technology is not forthcoming, one could look to improvements in computer architectures to result in chips requiring less power.

Reference-contexts: This property, called the principle of optimality is exploited by the algorithm. It is very interesting to note that the principle of optimality is not satisfied by some realistic optimization criterion <ref> [7] </ref>. In particular, as we will show in Section 5, this principle is not satisfied for optimization criteria of interest to mobile systems. <p> We would like to note that a similar approach was suggested in <ref> [7] </ref> in the context of optimizing response time for parallel machines with bounds on system throughput degradation. 1 Note that the send/receive power asymmetry increases a great deal in packet radio and cellular phone networks. <p> In general, additive metrics also satisfy the principle. 2 In <ref> [7] </ref>, it was noted that the response time metric in parallel system violated the principle of optimality. <p> For the sake of brevity, we explain the algorithm only for optimization criterion 1. As noted in Section 5 and also in <ref> [7] </ref>, the following partial order, denoted by 1 , may be used as a criterion for pruning plans in a dynamic programming search. 13 p 1 1 p 2 if work (p 1 ) work (p 2 ) and energy (p 1 ) energy (p 2 ).

Reference-contexts: A final point to be made is that, since, cost models used for estimating query performance are routinely inaccurate, our inaccuracy to within a factor of 2 is by no means excessive. This is further supported by the following statement in <ref> [11] </ref>: "The goal of query optimization is not to find the best plan but to avoid the worst plan". 5 Search algorithm for Optimization Criterion 1 In this section, we discuss a dynamic programming algorithm to search for the plan with the least energy among all plans whose total work is

Reference-contexts: Adapting commercially available DBMS's to a mobile environment requires addressing a multitude of technical problems. Some of these problems are primarily operating system related (e.g., support for transparent changes of internet addresses while moving, as studied in <ref> [12] </ref>). But there are also many database-specific areas demanding additional research.

Reference-contexts: A new type of problem that appears in mobile systems is due to these machines' reliance on portable energy sources. Mobile computers rely on battery power, and this places limits on their effective usability. The typical machine can last for about two hours <ref> [13] </ref> before forcing its user to shut down or replace the batteries. While this may be sufficient for a casual user, it is not so for more serious workers. The latter will also make heavier use of machine resources, probably reducing their average battery life a great deal. <p> Under what their makers consider as 2 "average use", such systems can be expected to last between 2 and 3 hours before recharging (or replacing) the batteries <ref> [13] </ref>. For heavy users of mobile computing, and certainly for those interested in extensive database access, the actual battery lifetimes encountered in practice may be even substantially shorter. Clearly, before mobile computers can achieve their utmost functionality, the power management issue must be addressed.
