Reference-contexts: These arguments used the usual circuit-complexity techniques augmented by specialized combinatorial techniques to handle the new axiom schemas. A natural next question (asked originally in [14]) was to examine the relative strength of the Count p principles for different values of p. Ajtai <ref> [1] </ref> first showed that, when p and q are distinct primes, proofs of Count q are not efficient even when given Count p as axiom schemas. To handle the Count p axioms Ajtai used a reworking of several ideas from the theory of representations of the symmetric group. <p> We will define a 1-1 map [ M DfiR fi stars (r; j) fi <ref> [1; ` + m] </ref> s The map Let F = C 1 _ C 2 _ : : :. Suppose that ae 2 S and let be the partial matching labelling the lexicographically first path in T (DfiR) ae (F ae ) that has length s. <p> The information ffi is then simply the vector of these numbers, one per edge of and is thus contained in <ref> [1; ` + m] </ref> s . Thus the image of the map is as required. Inverting the map It remains to show that the map we have just defined is indeed 1-1. To do this we show how to recover ae from its image. The reconstruction is iterative. <p> Proof of Theorem 12 For ` 0 let N ` = ((p + 2) ` p ` )=2. We show by induction that there is a 2 ` 1-design for <ref> [1; N ` + p ` ] </ref> fi [1; N ` ] over Z p . The theorem then will follow by Lemma 13. For ` = 0, letting D (;) = 1 is sufficient to satisfy the conditions for a 0-design. <p> Proof of Theorem 12 For ` 0 let N ` = ((p + 2) ` p ` )=2. We show by induction that there is a 2 ` 1-design for [1; N ` + p ` ] fi <ref> [1; N ` ] </ref> over Z p . The theorem then will follow by Lemma 13. For ` = 0, letting D (;) = 1 is sufficient to satisfy the conditions for a 0-design. <p> The theorem then will follow by Lemma 13. For ` = 0, letting D (;) = 1 is sufficient to satisfy the conditions for a 0-design. Suppose we have a 2 ` 1-design D for <ref> [1; N ` + p ` ] </ref> fi [1; N ` ]. Observe that N `+1 + p `+1 = (p + 1)(N ` + p ` ) + N ` and N `+1 = (N ` + p ` ) + (p + 1)N ` . <p> The theorem then will follow by Lemma 13. For ` = 0, letting D (;) = 1 is sufficient to satisfy the conditions for a 0-design. Suppose we have a 2 ` 1-design D for [1; N ` + p ` ] fi <ref> [1; N ` ] </ref>. Observe that N `+1 + p `+1 = (p + 1)(N ` + p ` ) + N ` and N `+1 = (N ` + p ` ) + (p + 1)N ` . <p> Applying Lemma 14 we get a 2 (2 ` 1) + 1 = 2 `+1 1-design D 0 for <ref> [1; N `+1 + p `+1 ] </ref> fi [1; N `+1 ] over Z p as required. 2 Proof of Lemma 14 Let D be a d-design for D fi R over Z p . <p> Applying Lemma 14 we get a 2 (2 ` 1) + 1 = 2 `+1 1-design D 0 for [1; N `+1 + p `+1 ] fi <ref> [1; N `+1 ] </ref> over Z p as required. 2 Proof of Lemma 14 Let D be a d-design for D fi R over Z p . <p> Proof Let D = <ref> [1; N + p ` ] </ref> and R = [1; N ]. <p> Proof Let D = [1; N + p ` ] and R = <ref> [1; N ] </ref>. Consider the polynomial X AaeD; jAj=p ` X X BaeR; jBj=p ` X ; range ()=B X : Since each X with jj = p ` appears exactly once in each sum, the value of the polynomial is 0.

Reference-contexts: One area of application of circuit-complexity techniques in proof complexity has been in the study of constant-depth Frege systems, proof systems in the conventional axiom schema/inference rule format each of whose constituent propositional formulas has constant depth. Ajtai <ref> [2] </ref> introduced circuit-complexity techniques to the study of constant-depth Frege systems and provided the first bound showing that the propositional pigeonhole principle did not have efficient constant-depth proofs. His arguments were simplified in [9] and the complexity lower bound improved to exponential in [7, 15, 13].

Reference-contexts: Given these results, a natural question to ask is: What is the power of the proof system if it is augmented by axiom schemas for some family of tautologies that does not have efficient proofs? Tautologies for several combinatorial principles have been studied. Ajtai <ref> [3] </ref> showed that if the pigeonhole principle is added as an axiom schema then the Count 2 tautologies still do not have efficient proofs, where the Count p tautologies express the fact that there is no perfect partition of a set M into blocks of size p, if jM j 6j

Reference-contexts: is no proof of Count q (R) in S 2 (R) + Count p (R). 10 Remarks It is interesting to compare the degree lower bound for the Nullstellensatz refutations of onto-PHP N+p ` N with the degree lower bound for PHP N+s N using the quite different construction in <ref> [5] </ref>. If we take p = 2 and N = (4 ` 2 ` )=2, then the degree lower bound from Theorem 12 is d = 2 ` 1 which satisfies N = d (d + 1)=2, i.e. the same degree as in [5] despite the more stringent conditions required in <p> N using the quite different construction in <ref> [5] </ref>. If we take p = 2 and N = (4 ` 2 ` )=2, then the degree lower bound from Theorem 12 is d = 2 ` 1 which satisfies N = d (d + 1)=2, i.e. the same degree as in [5] despite the more stringent conditions required in Theorem 12. (For p &gt; 2 Theorem 12 does not give as large a degree bound.) It would be interesting to improve the lower bound and close the gap between p ` 1 and 2 ` 1 or to reduce the size of

Reference-contexts: This approach was a natural extension of the methods in 1 [8, 16]. Riis [16] laid out a framework involving showing that certain `exceptional forests' of decision trees do not exist. This problem was left unsolved in [16]. Working along similar lines, Beame, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pitassi, and Pudlak <ref> [6] </ref> introduced the notion of a Nullstellensatz proof system and reduced the existence question for objects similar to Riis' exceptional forests to the degree required for certain proofs in this system. <p> They also showed lower bounds on this degree using Ramsey theory, and thus extended Ajtai's results to a somewhat wider class of p, q combinations. Riis [17] applied similar Ramsey theory arguments directly to the forests themselves. One important contribution of <ref> [6] </ref> was to show that exponential lower bounds for Count q given Count p would follow from improved degree bounds for the Nullstellen-satz proofs. These improved degree bounds were shown by Buss, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pudlak, Razborov, and Sgall [10] who introduced a nice inductive method for producing such bounds. <p> Then, as in the argument of Riis [16] and Beame and Pitassi [8], we show that having a k-evaluation implies the existence of a certain forest of matching decision trees. Following this we show, using a reduction analogous to that of Beame, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pitassi, and Pudlak <ref> [6] </ref>, that the existence of such a forest implies a small degree Nullstellensatz refutation of an associated family of polynomials. Finally, the proof that such a small degree refutation does not exist is analogous to that of Buss, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pudlak, Razborov, and Sgall [10]. <p> ; v p g the branches with leaf label e in T v j are all elements of the form f 1 p j i 2 Br e (T fl and are thus independent of the choice of j. 2 The above construction of a generic system is essentially from <ref> [6] </ref>. Alternatively, one could create the trees T fl v by constructing the canonical decision trees for the G v without applying any restriction.

These improved degree bounds were shown by Buss, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pudlak, Razborov, and Sgall <ref> [10] </ref> who introduced a nice inductive method for producing such bounds. The present paper uses similar techniques to give a further refinement of our understanding of the strength of these combinatorial principles. Thus far, we have referred to `the' pigeonhole principle. <p> Finally, the proof that such a small degree refutation does not exist is analogous to that of Buss, Impagliazzo, Krajicek, Pudlak, Razborov, and Sgall <ref> [10] </ref>. This last is the main new technical contribution and the reader who is familiar with the other aspects of this paper may wish to skip directly to section 8. <p> Following <ref> [10] </ref>, we also fix a cyclic ordering on the elements within each block, e.g. as a permutation oe : D 0 [ R 0 !
