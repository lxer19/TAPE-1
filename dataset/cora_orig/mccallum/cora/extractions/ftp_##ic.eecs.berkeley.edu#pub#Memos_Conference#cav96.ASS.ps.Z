Title: Verifying Continuous Time Markov Chains

Abstract: We present a logical formalism for expressing properties of continuous time Markov chains. The semantics for such properties arise as a natural extension of previous work on discrete time Markov chains to continuous time. The major result is that the verification problem is decidable; this is shown using results in algebraic and transcendental number theory.

There are two types of formulae in CSL: state formulae (which are true or false in a specific state), and path formulae (which are true or false along a specific path). A state formula is given by the following syntax: 1. a for a 2 A 2.

Reference-contexts: Historical note:This result implies the transcendence of (take n = 2, c 1 = 2; c 2 = i); it was the first proof of the non-algebraic nature of . For a highly readable account of the development of this theorem, refer to <ref> [5] </ref>. Suppose the expression P k 0 k 0 e ffi k 0 is degenerate, i.e. it consists of a single term of the form 0 . Then the expression denotes an algebraic number, and it can be effectively checked if it is greater than c.

Reference-contexts: This observation leads to the following lemma: Lemma 2. Each element of the P l;m (t) matrices may be expressed as P where j and ffi j are algebraic complex numbers. Proof.

Reference-contexts: First, we review some elementary algebra. An algebraic complex number is any complex number which is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Properties of the algebraic numbers are derived in <ref> [8] </ref>; of particular interest to us is the fact that they constitute a field, and that the real and imaginary parts of an algebraic number are also algebraic. <p> We will denote the set of complex numbers which are of the form P where the j and ffi j are algebraic by E A . This set is a ring, and is referred to as the transcendental extension of A by e <ref> [8] </ref>. Tarksi [11] proved that the theory of the field of complex numbers (i.e. the theory of the structure &lt; IC; +; fi; 0; 1&gt;) was decidable; an effective (in the recursion theoretic sense) procedure for converting formulas to a logically equivalent quantifier free form was given. <p> In order to decide if s (f 1 ) &gt; c, we exploit a celebrated theorem of transcendental number theory <ref> [8] </ref>. Theorem 3 (Lindemann-Weirstrass:). Let c 1 ; : : : c n be pairwise distinct algebraic numbers belonging to IC.
