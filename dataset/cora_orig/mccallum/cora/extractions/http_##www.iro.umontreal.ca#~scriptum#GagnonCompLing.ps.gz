Reference-contexts: The global process this occurrence and the object representing this time. The deep generation process is decomposed into two steps. In the first one, the conceptual representation is segmented and structured to build a discourse representation. In our discourse representation, which uses the SDRT <ref> (Asher, 1993) </ref>, the information is cut into smaller segments where each segment contains the information to be expressed 3 Computational Linguistics Volume 0, Number 0 by a single sentence. The structure linking these segments relies on a set of rhetorical relations.

Reference-contexts: The ones that tackled this problem have focussed on the production of verb tenses, without solving the choice of temporal adverbs. The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of generating in French the elements that convey the temporal localization. In a previous paper <ref> (Gagnon and Lapalme, 1992) </ref> we proposed a method for integrating the expression of temporal concepts in the text generation process.

Reference-contexts: This structure is represented as an ordered sequence of functions that must be fulfilled. The term "function", in this context, refers to the role played by a constituent of a phrase to achieve a communicative goal <ref> (Halliday, 1985) </ref>. For example, a sentence can often be decomposed in three constituents fulfilling the following functions: 18 Michel Gagnon and Guy Lapalme From conceptual time to linguistic time Subject, Predicate and Object 4 .

Reference-contexts: We started from the work of Bras (1990), who proposes a method to extract the temporal structure of a text, according to Discourse Representation Theory <ref> (Kamp, 1981) </ref>, relying on an analysis of adverbials of temporal location made by Molines (1990). To implement the production of ATLs and verb tenses, we have chosen the systemic grammar of Halliday that formulates the syntactic structure of a sentence as the result of a sequence of semantic choices.

Reference-contexts: Representation Theory (SDRT) proposed by Asher (1993), which extends DRT by adding rhetorical relations such as the ones found in RST <ref> (Mann and Thompson, 1987) </ref>. We call SDRS one such discourse structure that contains the same information as in figure 2 except that it has been segmented. The top-level DRS contains three small DRSs that are linked by rhetorical relations: each DRS corresponds to a sentence.

Reference-contexts: To implement the production of ATLs and verb tenses, we have chosen the systemic grammar of Halliday that formulates the syntactic structure of a sentence as the result of a sequence of semantic choices. We developed a grammar interpreter inspired by Nigel <ref> (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991) </ref>, but departing from it on many aspects, especially on the representation for the production of verb tenses and adverbs. In this paper, we show the essential elements needed to produce a text such as (D1). <p> Furthermore, many aspects are neglected, such as the type of reference expressed by the adverbial: it is not clear how his system can represent the distinctions between anaphoric, deictic and autonomous localizers because the link between the semantic and the syntactic levels is not fully explained. Nigel <ref> (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991) </ref> offers the largest coverage of English but the variety of forms for ATLs is quite limited. Still the temporal localization that may be expressed by different types of syntactic structures, is represented in Nigel by systems that are dispersed in the whole grammar network. <p> We can see from the approximate translations given in table 9 that the systems for generating French and English verb tenses differ greatly. For English verb tenses, the method implemented in Nigel resorts to a recursive semantics involving temporal markers, as proposed by Halliday <ref> (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991) </ref>. The purpose in this approach is to deal correctly with complex structures like will have been eating. Put simply, the idea is to consider that each auxiliary reflects a relation between two temporal markers. This suggest a network that displays a recursive process.
