Title: A Network Model for Resource Allocation Problems in WANs  
Author: George Semeczko 
Affiliation: School of Computing Science Queensland University of Technology  
Abstract: Many papers have been written about resource allocation problems in distributed systems. In solving these optimization problems there has always been a tradeoff between the optimality of the solution, the expense in deriving a solution and the complexity of the problem being solved. For problems in Wide Area Networks, the complexity of the problem is immediately more complicated than those for Local Area Networks as the variable communication costs becomes another factor in the optimization function. In this paper, we show that in practice Wide Area Networks have more structure than usually assumed. Given this, a structured model is presented that can be used to approximate Wide Area Networks and allow better solutions to optimization problems due to its properties.

Reference-contexts: that LANs are not possible and therefore a simple network is not a suitable model 2) General network models can represent the networks in 1), but because of their generality, efficiency in solution computations is sacrificed A motivating example can be found in Figure 1 for an existing commercial network <ref> [5] </ref> . A network structure of this type is typical of many networks constructed for organisations spread over wide areas. The basic structure is one of LANs that are connected by Wide Area Networks (WANs) or Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). <p> This refinement phase improved the result in the original network. To find a better model to map to, the example of a commercially used WAN from Figure 1 is considered as a guide. Part of the diagram, originally from <ref> [5] </ref> , has been enlarged and sites numbered to aid in its explanation in Figure 3. Several observations can be made concerning this network.

Reference-contexts: Therefore for a given network, several CNs may be constructed to solve different problems due to the use of different mapping functions. To aid in the construction of the mapping algorithm, cluster analysis techniques are useful. In cluster analysis <ref> [6] </ref> one definition of a cluster is as follows: ...an aggregate of points in the test space such that the distance between any two points in the cluster is less than the distance between any point in the cluster and any other point not in it. <p> Its usefulness is then examined and examples displayed. 2.

Five broad areas of cluster analysis techniques are outlined in [6] : Hierarchical, Optimisation, Density-Seeking, Clumping and Other techniques. Of these the Hierarchical Clustering Techniques (HCT) appear to be the most appropriate. The main reason for this is that the HCT apply a routing strategy to reproduce hierarchical structure in the data [12] . <p> One advantage of the HCTs is that there are no requirements for a priori knowledge of the number of clusters to be formed. Many of the other techniques require this. The HCT is also most appropriate for distances rather than similarities 3 <ref> [6] </ref> . Another advantage to HCTs is that they are more efficient, needing less computational space and processing, thereby allowing much larger data sets to be used. There are some drawbacks with HCTs though. HCTs can suffer from a problem called chaining [9] . <p> There are some drawbacks with HCTs though. HCTs can suffer from a problem called chaining [9] . This occurs when distinct clusters are grouped together due to intermediate elements, tending to create elongated clusters. Chaining may or may not be desirable for many cluster analysis problems <ref> [6] </ref> , but as the CN mapping algorithm seeks spherical clusters, chaining is to be avoided as it would create too great a distortion. This problem is inherit in many techniques based on the single-link (closest-neighbour) method, but may be solved by the application of stopping rules. <p> Two such rules for the HCTs are discussed in [12] . These use statistical measures to determine when there is a significant change in the distribution criteria. Some of the non-HCTs provide measures that may also be useful as stopping rules, such as the density search technique of Taxmap <ref> [6] </ref> . These may be useful to stop chaining in other HCTs or in avoiding other space distortions in not only the inter-cluster measures but also distortions in the intra-cluster measures. Another spacedistorting HCT that should be eliminated from consideration is the complete-linkage (furthest-neighbour) method. <p> In the median This point is not a major advantage as distances can be converted to similarities . 6 technique large differences in the diameters of clusters to be fused will cause smaller clusters to be virtually lost <ref> [6] </ref> . For the group-average technique this problem is solved by using the number of elements in each cluster. This is a problem for the CN mapping algorithm as it allows all sites equal input into the mapping outcome. An example is provided in Figure 6 to show this situation.

For consistency with this previous work and allowing for future possible comparisons this formulation is used for the DWCT. <p> Also for future comparison purposes with other methods a property of the DWCT is stated. From the above formulation it can be stated that the string of measures associated with successive hierarchical fusions will be monotonic <ref> [9] </ref> because g = 0 and that ( a i j 3.4 Intra-cluster Measures The intra-cluster measures are reassessed in a similar manner to the inter-cluster measures. This differs to the inter-cluster measure calculations in that the edges are all internal to the newly fused cluster.
