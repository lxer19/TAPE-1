Title: Where Do Relations Come From?  
Author: Michael Gasser and Eliana Colunga 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department, Cognitive Science Program Indiana University  
Abstract: Relational knowledge is a hallmark of human cognition and the subject of a vast body of research. In this paper we argue that existing accounts of relations are inadequate because they have little to say about how relations arise in the first place and because they tend to be limited to particular sorts of relational tasks. We present a new approach to the learning and representation of relations, an approach that makes use of what we call micro-relation units (MRUs). Each MRU represents a relation between features of different objects rather than between objects themselves. We show how this approach offers an account of the grounding of relations, and we describe a neural-network implementation of the MRU framework and show how it enables a variety of relational tasks to be performed by the same system.

Reference-contexts: While there is much more to on than just vertical orientation, there is little more than horizontal orientation to left. Concepts such as left can be made easier through training that clearly establishes additional correlations, for example, with handedness <ref> (Clark, 1973) </ref>. Conclusions As is shown by our use of language and the kinds of inferences we can make, we have the ability to represent and use relational knowledge. To understand this ability, we need to take into consideration two often neglected facts about relational knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The ability to reason in terms of relations appears to distinguish people from most or all other animals. (Pearce, 1994). And, beginning at the age of 4, people's judgments of the similarity of two items tends to be based on relational rather than purely featural similarity <ref> (Gentner, Rattermann, Markman, & Kotovsky, 1995) </ref>. Any account of relational knowledge must deal with the representation of knowledge as well as with the ways in which it is used in performing particular cognitive tasks. In what follows, we consider these in turn.

Reference-contexts: This is the approach used in standard predicate-calculus notation: above (book, table), illustrated in Figure 2. and the arguments are symbols, the bindings are represented by the positions of the arguments. Within connectionist networks, this approach is used in the model of Halford et al. <ref> (Halford et al., 1994) </ref>. Here the relation term and the related objects, which are all activation vectors, are fed into banks of units which are dedicated to representing the components of the relation.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally conceived, a relation includes two further kinds of information: (a) an element that characterizes the content of the relation and its arity, the relation term, and (b) a set of bindings, a mapping of the object arguments onto roles in the relation <ref> (Halford, Wilson, & Phillips, 1998) </ref>. The binding of objects to roles is required in order to distinguish, for example, the situation in which a book is above a table from the situation in which a table is above a book.

Reference-contexts: Both the activation and the phase angle of an MOU are potentially modified each time a unit is updated, and both depend on the coupling function on the weights into the unit. The activation function for both MOUs and MRUs is the familiar interactive activation rule <ref> (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of this paper, we consider only the case of unsupervised learning, for which there is simply a set of training patterns to be auto-associated rather than a set of inputs and associated targets. The learning algorithm is an adaptation of contrastive Hebbian learning (CHL) <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref>. CHL takes place in two phases. During the positive phase, the training patterns are clamped in the network, the network is allowed to settle, and the weight updates are accumulated. <p> The energy function is the sum of two components. One of these implements the basic Hebbian relationship: energy decreases with the product of each weight and the activations of the units joined by the connection. The other component tends to drive activations back to their resting values <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref>. We can perform gradient descent on the energy function by differentiating by each of the weights. Given a particular sort of unit input function, this yields a learning rule for the two weight update phases. <p> We believe that our model is a first step in this direction. Appendix: Mathematical Details of the Model Micro-Object Units In this section we show how Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref> needs to be modified to accommodate units with relative phase angles. We follow the derivation in Movellan closely.

Reference-contexts: Relational knowledge, however, goes beyond this sort of simple associative knowledge in that the association between the related elements is made explicit and accessible to the rest of the system <ref> (Phillips, Halford, & Wilson, 1995) </ref>. Among other consequences, this property of relational knowledge permits the representation and learning of associations between relations.
