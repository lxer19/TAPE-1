Abstract: In this paper we reconstruct majorization as a partial order on vectors (ordered sequences) using linear algebra. We do this in two different ways, one following a recent extension of majorization to permit partial ordering among the indices of the sequences, and the other following a model of majorization as `exchangeability'. Majorization with respect to a partial order is shown to be a special case of majorization as exchangeability. In this special case, the resulting majorization order always defines a distributive lattice that is isomorphic to the standard real vector lattice. In classical majorization theory, the semigroup of doubly-stochastic matrices plays a crucial role, both in the definition of majorization and in the modeling of exchange. We generalize majorization to permit any matrix semigroup of exchanges. Various semigroups of stochastic matrices make particularly interesting kinds of exchanges, and simultaneously define useful notions of majorization. Finally, we investigate notions of convexity. When the functions in question are differentiable, we show that both Schur convexity and submodularity can be reexpressed naturally in this linear algebraic formulation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Classical majorization was first defined by Muirhead [15], and was developed by Hardy, Littlewood and Polya in their study of symmetric means [7]. Their classical theory defines a majorization order on multisets, and although quite beautiful is also quite complex. The treatment in Marshall and Olkin's book <ref> [14] </ref> presents the theory with a variety of inequivalent formulations, each with its own notational conventions. 1 A linear algebraic formalization of majorization is important for several reasons. First, replacing multisets with vectors permits many notational simplifications. <p> Third, it allows us to understand majorization better, in ways ranging from a deeper appreciation of the majorization ordering to clearer convexity results. Defining majorization via linear algebra also generalizes neatly on the classical definition, and clarifies the significance of various previous generalizations of majorization listed in <ref> [14, ch.14] </ref>. All in all, the linear algebraic reconstruction of majorization appears very natural. 2 Classical Ma jorization 2.1 Majorization and Exchange Majorization was studied early in the twentieth century by economists, in formalizing unevenness of distribution of income (and greed, in a sense). <p> Dalton formalized his 1920 `principle of transfers', showing that a distribution is less uneven than another if it can be obtained from the other by transferring some income from a richer to a poorer income-receiver. A good summary is in chapter 1 of <ref> [14] </ref>. Of the three income distributions shown by the Lorenz curves in Figure 1, the bottommost (theoretical `communism') is the least uneven: each member of the population receives the same income. <p> H Hj `capitalism' H H H HY `communism' percentage of population percentage of income Income density x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 `capitalism' 80% 07% 05% 04% 04% (in between) 50% 15% 15% 10% 10% `communism' 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% 1 Marshall and Olkin's book <ref> [14] </ref>, the primary reference on the majorization literature, uses row vectors and matrix multipli cation on the right, while we now use the more standard column vectors and matrix multiplication on the left. 2 Former inhabitants of communist countries tell us that the curve for `communism' in Figure 1 is highly <p> In the Lorenz sense, one distribution is more uneven than another precisely when its probability density majorizes that of the other, i.e., when the integral of its density dominates the integral of the other density. As a result, classical majorization has found many applications in stochastic scheduling <ref> [14] </ref>, optimal coding [17], etc. The book by Marshall and Olkin [14] provides a good survey of the classical theory and its applications. Classical majorization is often defined as a binary relation `' on multisets (or `unordered sequences') [14]. <p> As a result, classical majorization has found many applications in stochastic scheduling <ref> [14] </ref>, optimal coding [17], etc. The book by Marshall and Olkin [14] provides a good survey of the classical theory and its applications.

Classical majorization is often defined as a binary relation `' on multisets (or `unordered sequences') [14]. In this paper, since we wish to both restate and extend the classical theory using linear algebra, we will model multisets with nonnegative n-vectors (or `ordered sequences') &lt; + n . <p> Since that time there have been been a multitude of results in this vein, which make majorization an important tool in inequality theory <ref> [14] </ref>. Definition 2.2 A Schur convex function is a function that is monotone with respect to . It follows that Schur convex functions are symmetric (invariant under permutation of their argument sequence). <p> i; j n): Another connection between convexity and majorization with many facets is that, given an interval I &lt; + and continuous : I ! &lt; + , the function F (z) = P i (z i ) is Schur convex if and only if is convex on I ([22], <ref> [14, p.68] </ref>, [20, p.333]). This brings us to the following summary. Copyright c fl1997 D. Stott Parker, Prasad Ram 5 2.4 Equivalent Formulations of Majorization One of the most provocative aspects of majorization is that it permits a number of equivalent formulations, and that these formulations are surprisingly diverse. <p> Theorem 2.3 (Hardy-Littlewood-Polya [7, p.89]; also <ref> [14, p.11] </ref>, [20, pp.320-321]) If : I ! &lt; + is any continuous convex function defined on an interval I &lt; + , then for all x; y 2 I n , x y iff i=1 n X (y i ): Theorem 2.4 (Pecaric-Proschan-Tong [20, pp.323-324]) If : I ! &lt; <p> all decreasing sequences x; y 2 I n and sequences w such that P k P k i=1 w i x i = i=1 w i y i ; n X w i (x i ) i=1 In addition, we can formulate majorization in terms of a vector cone ordering <ref> [14, pp.424-426] </ref>. <p> When the sequences x and y are in descendingly-sorted order, vector majorization is called weak majorization (x w y) in the majorization literature <ref> [14] </ref>. When the sequences in S are not sorted, then sequence ordering matters, and the relation `' is not symmetric in the sequence elements. Definition 4.3 (for `') has several advantages over Definition 2.1 (for `'): 1. <p> R Because (x 1 + x 2 + + x n ) (x 2 + + x n ) x n ; R x = sort# R whenever x 2 &lt; + n . (With this total order, vector majorization is called weak supermajorization (y w x) in the literature <ref> [14, p.10] </ref>.) Similarly, if the order is reversed (so 1 w w n and ij = 1 iff i j, as in Figure 3), then relative to this order we find the reverse characterization R x = [ x 1 (x 1 + x 2 ) : : : (x 1 <p> Proof The permutations actually form a group. Each of the other sets contains the identity matrix, and is closed under multiplication because every matrix can be expressed as a convex sum of elementary matrices, and products of these convex sums are convex sums. For example, the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem <ref> [2, 14] </ref> states that, if P is the set of permutation matrices, DSM can be generated as DSM = convex (P ) = f 1 P 1 + + m P m j P = fP 1 ; : : : ; P m g; 0 i 1; m X i <p> DSM-majorization: x DSM y iff x = Dy for some DSM D. wDSM-majorization: x wDSM y iff x = W y for some wDSM W . An equivalent definition is x wDSM y iff x vec Dy for some DSM D. This is called weak majorization (x w y) <ref> [14, ch.2.C] </ref> when x and y are in descendingly-sorted order. There are many other semigroups. The n fi n nonnegative matrices M n (&lt; + ), any linear group (subgroup of GL n (&lt;)), or the convex sums convex (T ) of a semigroup T are natural examples. <p> Proof The proof for PMs is extremely well-known. The result for DSMs and classical majorization is Theorem 2.2; see <ref> [14, ch.2] </ref>. The proof for wDSMs is essentially identical. <p> The `' direction is trivial. 2 Perhaps surprisingly, no such theorem exists for arbitrary DSMs. For example, the DSM 0 :5 :5 0 0 :5 :5 A cannot be generated by any product of pairwise exchange DSMs <ref> [14, p.23] </ref>. <p> Stott Parker, Prasad Ram 15 7 Ma jorization and Convexity To conclude, we characterize the impact of our generalized majorization definition on two conventional notions of convexity: Schur convexity and submodularity. There are actually many connections between majorization and convexity. See for example <ref> [14] </ref> (in which submodular functions are called L-subadditive functions), and [20]. <p> Here, we consider only vector majorization. Similar results are obtained for other kinds of majorization. Theorem 7.4 (Lorentz <ref> [14, p.150] </ref>) When twice differentiable, f is submodular on the vector lattice h&lt; + n ; vec ; min vec ; max vec i iff @x i @x j Proof Essentially definition. <p> In fact, the Hessian r 2 f = ( @ 2 f @x i @x j ) still can even be positive semidefinite (hence f can be convex), or be an M-matrix <ref> [14, p.508] </ref>.

Stott Parker, Prasad Ram 5 2.4 Equivalent Formulations of Majorization One of the most provocative aspects of majorization is that it permits a number of equivalent formulations, and that these formulations are surprisingly diverse. <p> Theorem 2.3 (Hardy-Littlewood-Polya [7, p.89]; also [14, p.11], <ref> [20, pp.320-321] </ref>) If : I ! &lt; + is any continuous convex function defined on an interval I &lt; + , then for all x; y 2 I n , x y iff i=1 n X (y i ): Theorem 2.4 (Pecaric-Proschan-Tong [20, pp.323-324]) If : I ! &lt; + is <p> Theorem 2.3 (Hardy-Littlewood-Polya [7, p.89]; also [14, p.11], [20, pp.320-321]) If : I ! &lt; + is any continuous convex function defined on an interval I &lt; + , then for all x; y 2 I n , x y iff i=1 n X (y i ): Theorem 2.4 (Pecaric-Proschan-Tong <ref> [20, pp.323-324] </ref>) If : I ! &lt; + is any continuous convex function defined on an interval I &lt; + , then for all decreasing sequences x; y 2 I n and sequences w such that P k P k i=1 w i x i = i=1 w i y i <p> There are actually many connections between majorization and convexity. See for example [14] (in which submodular functions are called L-subadditive functions), and <ref> [20] </ref>.

In this section we reproduce necessary background concepts, and in subsequent sections reconstruct them in terms of linear algebra. 3.1 Partial Orders and Lattices We need elementary definitions for partial orders and lattices; for a comprehensive tutorial see [5]. <p> Mobius developed the concept in 1832 in analyzing the distribution of primes. The theory gives an interesting and broad foundation on which to build a theory of majorization. We present here a classical formulation adapted from Rota <ref> [21] </ref>. Copyright c fl1997 D. Stott Parker, Prasad Ram 7 Definition 3.1 The zeta function of a partial order `v' is defined by (x; y) = 1 if x v y 0 otherwise. <p> Notice the zeta function is just the (transitive closure of the) incidence matrix of the graph of the partial order. Rota <ref> [21, pp.346-347] </ref> explains how the zeta function is in fact related to the Riemann zeta function of number theory. <p> Inversion formulas give a way to recover a function g (x) from a (discrete approximation of an) integral f (y) = R Theorem 3.1 (Mobius inversion formula <ref> [21] </ref>): Let hS; vi be a locally finite partially ordered set with least element ?, and g : S ! &lt; satisfy g (?) = 0. <p> Define f (y) = xvy X g (x) (x; y): Then f (?) = 0 also, and g (x) = yvx There are many important instances of this inversion formula <ref> [1, 21] </ref>, including: Finite differencing || S is the set f0; : : :; n 1g with the `' total order: f (j) = i=0 (j; i) = &lt; 1 if j = i 0 otherwise g (i) = ji Mobius inversion formula || S is the set f0; : :

Reference-contexts: Given the linear algebraic approach of this paper, classical majorization will be treated as a preorder on vectors. 2.3 Classical Majorization and Convexity In 1923 Schur published the memorandum <ref> [22] </ref> that first connected majorization with convexity. Since that time there have been been a multitude of results in this vein, which make majorization an important tool in inequality theory [14]. Definition 2.2 A Schur convex function is a function that is monotone with respect to . <p> More generally, the function F (z) = h sort# ( w ); sort# ( z ) i is symmetric and Schur convex for x 2 &lt; + n , given any sequence of nonnegative weights w = [w 1 : : : w n ].

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, Lih [12] established the conditions for Schur convexity for Hwang's generalized form of majorization. Using the elegant presentation of Seymour and Welsh <ref> [23] </ref>, Lih also reconciled Hwang's majorization with the Holley [8] and FKG [6] inequalities, two basic inequalities that underly results involving submodularity. All of these results rely in a central way on LTSMs. <p> Using the elegant presentation of Seymour and Welsh [23], Lih also reconciled Hwang's majorization with the Holley [8] and FKG [6] inequalities, two basic inequalities that underly results involving submodularity.
