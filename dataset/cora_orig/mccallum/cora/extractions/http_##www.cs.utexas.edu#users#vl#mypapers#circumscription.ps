Reference-contexts: The relation between the two forms of circumscription is discussed in Section 5 of [ McCarthy, 1980 ] and in Section 7.4 of <ref> [ Etherington, 1988 ] </ref> . The abnormality predicate was introduced in [ McCarthy, 1986 ] . It is applied there to "aspects" of objects, rather than to objects themselves, because an object can be normal in some aspects (relative to some defaults), and abnormal in others. <p> Proposition 10 belongs to Etherington [1988]; the special case when is a single formula was found independently by Lifschitz [1986]. Corollary 4 was also proved independently by Etherington [1988] and Lifschitz [1986].

Reference-contexts: The other examples mentioned above are bounded. Since the boundedness property is undecidable <ref> [ Gaifman et al., 1987 ] </ref> , it follows that it is an undecidable problem to determine whether or not a circumscription of this form is expressible without second order quantifiers.

Reference-contexts: Besides being useful as theoretical tools, they can be also implemented as knowledge bases, if all axioms except for a finite number are represented by means of procedural attachment (see <ref> [ Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987 ] </ref> , Section 4.4). The idea of representing circumscription policies by metamathematical declarations belongs to McCarthy [1986]. The view that a circumscriptive theory corresponds to a conjunction of several circumscriptions, applied to the same formula, was developed in [ Lifschitz, 1989b ] .

Reference-contexts: The definition of "formula" circumscription introduced there shows, moreover, how one can circumscribe a predicate expressed by a formula, and not merely a predicate constant. Circumscribing equality was investigated by Etherington, Mercer and Reiter [1985]. The exposition in Section 2.3 follows <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] </ref> . The need to circumscribe higher order predicates was demonstrated by Baker [1989], in connection with the applications discussed here in Section 5.1. <p> The need to circumscribe higher order predicates was demonstrated by Baker [1989], in connection with the applications discussed here in Section 5.1. The model-theoretic view of circumscription presented in Section 2.5 was developed in [ McCarthy, 1980 ] for the basic case and extended to the general case in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] </ref> . A further development of this idea can be found in Shoham's concept of "preferential entailment" [ Shoham, 1987 ] . <p> Predicate completion was first introduced in the context of logic programming by Clark [1978], and its relation to circumscription was investigated by Reiter [1982]. The methods presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 were developed in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] </ref> . Propositions 4 and 5 are from [ Lifschitz, 1987b ] . Proposition 6, due to Rabinov [1989], is a generalization of the "separable" case of circumscription [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] . <p> The methods presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 were developed in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] </ref> .

Proposition 14 is from [ Lifschitz, 1987b ] , and Proposition 15 is from [ Lifs-chitz, 1985b ] . One other equivalent transformation of parallel circumscription is proposed by de Kleer and Konolige [1989].

The treatment of preconditions outlined at the end of Section 5.2 is based on <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1987a ] </ref> . The concept of well-foundedness, for the case when Z is empty, was invented by Etherington, Mercer and Reiter [1985], as well as the example (61).

"Introspective circumscription" [ Lifschitz, 1989a ] is a modification of autocircumscription which includes predicate circumscription as a special case.

Reference-contexts: Two cases when circumscription is expressible in the first order language that are not discussed here are existential formulas [ Kolaitis and Papadimitriou, 1988 ] and monadic formulas ( [ McCarthy, 1986 ] , Section 13). Proposition 7 is from <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1991 ] </ref> . Kolaitis and Papadimitriou [1988] study an important subclass of definite first order formulas from the point of view of the expressibility of their circumscriptions in the first order language, which includes, for instance, Examples 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 12. <p> The first attempt to apply circumscription to the frame problem [ Mc-Carthy, 1986 ] was unsuccessful [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] . The formulation presented in Section 5 follows [ Baker, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1991 ] </ref> . The treatment of preconditions outlined at the end of Section 5.2 is based on [ Lifschitz, 1987a ] . The concept of well-foundedness, for the case when Z is empty, was invented by Etherington, Mercer and Reiter [1985], as well as the example (61).

Reference-contexts: The technical implementation of this idea proposed in that paper is called now "domain" circumscription|to distinguish it from the concept of "predicate" circumscription, which is subject of this chapter. The relation between the two forms of circumscription is discussed in Section 5 of <ref> [ McCarthy, 1980 ] </ref> and in Section 7.4 of [ Etherington, 1988 ] . The abnormality predicate was introduced in [ McCarthy, 1986 ] . <p> The exposition in Section 2.3 follows [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] . The need to circumscribe higher order predicates was demonstrated by Baker [1989], in connection with the applications discussed here in Section 5.1. The model-theoretic view of circumscription presented in Section 2.5 was developed in <ref> [ McCarthy, 1980 ] </ref> for the basic case and extended to the general case in [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] .

Reference-contexts: The relation between the two forms of circumscription is discussed in Section 5 of [ McCarthy, 1980 ] and in Section 7.4 of [ Etherington, 1988 ] . The abnormality predicate was introduced in <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> . It is applied there to "aspects" of objects, rather than to objects themselves, because an object can be normal in some aspects (relative to some defaults), and abnormal in others. This is similar to the use of several abnormality predicates in Section 4.2. <p> The idea of varying some predicates and functions is mentioned in [ Mc-Carthy, 1980 ] in passing, as well as the use of second order formulas. These two ideas were explored in more detail in <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> . The definition of "formula" circumscription introduced there shows, moreover, how one can circumscribe a predicate expressed by a formula, and not merely a predicate constant. Circumscribing equality was investigated by Etherington, Mercer and Reiter [1985]. <p> Proposition 6, due to Rabinov [1989], is a generalization of the "separable" case of circumscription [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] . Two cases when circumscription is expressible in the first order language that are not discussed here are existential formulas [ Kolaitis and Papadimitriou, 1988 ] and monadic formulas ( <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> , Section 13). Proposition 7 is from [ Lifschitz, 1991 ] . <p> The discussion of inheritance reasoning in Section 4 generally follows <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> ; Brewka [1987] describes a similar approach to representing inheritance by circumscription in a general form, as a translation from a frame-based language. The method of expressing priorities used in Section 4.2 was introduced in [ Lifschitz, 1989b ] . <p> Proposition 13 generalizes a theorem from [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] . The idea of parallel circumscription goes back to [ McCarthy, 1980 ] . Priorities were first introduced in <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> , where they are applied to 60 "aspects," rather than predicates. Our exposition follows [ Lifschitz, 1985b ] . Proposition 14 is from [ Lifschitz, 1987b ] , and Proposition 15 is from [ Lifs-chitz, 1985b ] . <p> Under some conditions, circumscription can be used to express the closed world assumption [ Lifschitz, 1985a ] and its generalizations [ Gelfond and Przymusinska, 1986 ] , as well as the unique names assumption ( <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> , Section 6; see also [ Etherington et al., 1985 ] ). On the relation of circumscription to logic programming, see [ Lifschitz, 1988 ] , [ Przymusinski, 1988 ] , [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] , [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1989 ] .

Reference-contexts: This is similar to the use of several abnormality predicates in Section 4.2. The basic case of circumscription is defined by McCarthy [1980] using a first order schema, instead of second order quantifiers. Properties of this "first order circumscription" are studied in <ref> [ Perlis and Minker, 1986 ] </ref> . Another way to avoid using predicate variables in the theory of circumscription is to replace them by variables for sets [ Perlis, 1987 ] .

Reference-contexts: One other equivalent transformation of parallel circumscription is proposed by de Kleer and Konolige [1989]. Two modifications of the definition of circumscription not discussed in this chapter are "pointwise circumscription" [ Lifschitz, 1987b ] and "auto-circumscription" <ref> [ Perlis, 1988 ] </ref> . The latter is quite different from predicate (or domain) circumscription, because it expresses the idea of introspection, rather than minimization. "Introspective circumscription" [ Lifschitz, 1989a ] is a modification of autocircumscription which includes predicate circumscription as a special case.

Reference-contexts: way to the goal formula. "Backward chaining" approaches to implementing special cases of circumscription, based on the ideas of logic programming and on Proposition 13 from Section 6.5, are discussed in [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1989 ] , [ Ginsberg, 1989 ] , [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] , <ref> [ Przymusinski, 1989 ] </ref> , [ Inoue and Helft, 1990 ] . The discussion of inheritance reasoning in Section 4 generally follows [ McCarthy, 1986 ] ; Brewka [1987] describes a similar approach to representing inheritance by circumscription in a general form, as a translation from a frame-based language.
