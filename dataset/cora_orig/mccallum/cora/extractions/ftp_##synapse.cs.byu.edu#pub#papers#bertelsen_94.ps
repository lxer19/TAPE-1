Abstract: This paper presents a mechanism to extend ID3 by classifying real valued inputs. Real valued inputs are classified through a neural network model termed the Competitive Classifier (CC). The CC forwards discrete classification results to the ID3 system, and accepts feedback from the ID3 system. Through the use of feedback, the ID3 system guides the CC into improving classifications.
