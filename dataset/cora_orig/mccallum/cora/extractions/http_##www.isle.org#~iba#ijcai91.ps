Abstract: We present a representational format for observed movements The representation has a temporal structure relating components of a single complex movement. We also present OXBOW, an unsupervised learning system, which constructs classes of these movements. Empirical results indicate that the system builds abstract movement concepts with appropriate component structure allowing it to predict the latter portions of a partially observed movement.

Reference-contexts: The common thread in Oxbow, Classit, and Cobweb is the control structure of the learning algorithms and the operators used to modify the knowledge structures. Also, they all use conditional probabilities in calculating the category utility function <ref> (Gluck & Corter, 1985) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present Oxbow, a system that acquires knowledge structures that facilitate the recognition of observed movements. This system is the recognition component of Mander, a larger model of motor-skill learning that also involves the generation of movements <ref> (Iba & Langley, 1987) </ref>. We view Oxbow within the paradigm of concept formation (Fisher & Pazzani, in press), in that it is required to construct "concepts" for particular classes of movements it has experienced. <p> There also is a direct application of movement recognition in domains where humans and robots are working together; the artificial agent should be able to infer goals and plans held by the human from observing and recognizing her actions. Following on our efforts at modeling human motor behavior <ref> (Iba & Langley, 1987) </ref>, we seek to connect Oxbow's predictions about movement recognition to the psychological literature on this subject. As a method for concept formation, Oxbow suggests a connection between is-a and part-of relations by using a concept formation mechanism to extract the structure of a composite concept. <p> In addition, the method is flexible with respect to environmental characteristics such as the number of joints in an arm or the number of arms operating in concert. Furthermore, the system's representation and organization carries over smoothly from recognition to generation of motor skills <ref> (Iba & Lang-ley, 1987) </ref>. We hope that this effort will contribute to the growing interest in motor control, but also that it will spark new interest in treating motor behavior as a broader two-part process recognition and control.

Reference-contexts: Although movements occur in the environment, Oxbow classifies and stores the parsed form of movements motor schemas. When motor schemas are combined to form abstractions or generalizations, we think of the resulting structures as concepts. One way to represent concepts in this type of model is to use probabilities <ref> (Smith & Medin, 1981) </ref>. A generalized motor schema includes a probability distribution for each attribute describing the state of the arm, as well as a probability for each entire state.
