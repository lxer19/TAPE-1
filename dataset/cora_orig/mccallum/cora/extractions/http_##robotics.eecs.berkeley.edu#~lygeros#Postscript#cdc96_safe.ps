Abstract: Considerable experimental and theoretical research has been carried out in an attempt to design an automated highway system that can provide more efficient utilization of the highways and at the same time be safer and more comfortable than the current highway system. Here we present a unified framework for carrying out safety calculations for the automated highway problem. We obtain sufficient conditions for a set of continuous controllers to be safe and use these conditions to design a discrete scheme that switches between them. Guarantees of safety for the closed loop, hybrid system follow by design.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Automated Highway Systems (AHS) are viewed as an alternative to increased congestion of the current highway system. Design of a fully automated highway is a very complex control problem. To manage the complexity of the design process a partially decentralized, hierarchical, hybrid control architecture was proposed <ref> [1] </ref>. Continuous feedback laws are used at the lower levels, to carry out tasks such as regulation and trajectory tracking for individual vehicles. The continuous controllers are supervised at the higher level by discrete controllers that are responsible for coordinating the actions of neighboring vehicles. <p> Finally, in Section 5 we will highlight some of the subtle issues raised by our design. 2 Modeling & Problem Statement 2.1 Underlying Assumptions Our goal is to design a safe control scheme for automated highway operation that supports platooning. In the concept of platooning <ref> [1] </ref> vehicles travel in tightly spaced groups (with spacings of about 1 meter) in an attempt to increase the highway throughput. The basic underlying assumption is what constitutes a "safe" system.

Reference-contexts: One would like to be able to prove that a proposed design does not lead to serious accidents. Here we present a unified framework for designing safe hybrid controllers for an AHS. Our approach builds on the work of <ref> [2] </ref>. The design is carried out in two phases. First, continuous controllers are designed using game theory to optimize the plant performance. As a corollary of the game theoretic design, requirements that the 1 Research supported by the PATH program, Institute of Transportation Studies, U.C.

Reference-contexts: Berkeley, under MOU-238. discrete controller needs to satisfy are established. This allows us to formulate and prove theorems that specify the conditions under which the safety of the closed loop system is guaranteed. The results obtained in this way are most closely related to those of <ref> [3] </ref>. Our approach allows us to use a more complicated vehicle model and consider the effect of collisions between vehicles that has been ignored so far. To facilitate the presentation we will state the safety theorem for the hybrid scheme first and then proceed to specify the continuous controllers.

Reference-contexts: The basic underlying assumption is what constitutes a "safe" system. Our analysis will indicate that requiring that no collisions occur may be too restrictive in terms of efficiency, as it does not allow platoons to join or spilt. Based on <ref> [4] </ref> we give the following definition: Definition 1 A safe collision between two vehicles is one where the relative velocity at impact is less than v a . An Automated Highway System where vehicles experience only safe collisions will be called a safe AHS. <p> An Automated Highway System where vehicles experience only safe collisions will be called a safe AHS. In the calculations v a = 3ms 1 will be used <ref> [4] </ref>. Our analysis will be based on the following assumptions: Assumption 1 AHS operation takes place under normal conditions (no faults or adverse environmental conditions), vehicle model parameters are known, collisions are instantaneous and perfectly elastic, vehicles have equal masses and lateral control is perfect.

Reference-contexts: Some of the above assumptions may be relaxed by a robust or adaptive design. The assumption of elastic collisions is accurate for low relative velocity collisions <ref> [5] </ref> while the assumption that all vehicles have equal mass can easily be relaxed. In this paper we will be primarily concerned with the operation of the leader of a platoon. <p> The state of all followers is in V F at t i , then all vehicles in the platoon will experience collisions with relative velocity at most v a during [t i ; t f ). The work of <ref> [5, 6] </ref> suggests that Assumption 2 is not unrealistic. This assumption allows us to ignore the internal dynamics of the platoon.

In terms of continuous controllers, the lane change can be broken into two phases. In the first phase vehicle A is aligned with a gap in the target lane. This is achieved by deceleration of either vehicle A or vehicle D.

Reference-contexts: Assume that vehicle B is leading while vehicle C comes last, i.e. x B &gt; x A &gt; x C &gt; 0. The dynamics of vehicle A will be approximated by a third order ordinary differential equation. Following <ref> [9] </ref>, we assume that feedback linearization has already been carried out and design controllers for the linear dynamics.

Comfort requirements can then be introduced by saturation. Let V 2 = int (V L ) [ fx 2 @V L jx 2 = a A min g.
