Title: Abstract  
Keyword: Key words: Fuzzy control, neural networks, distributed inferencing  
Abstract: The report presents a model of a fuzzy control in which decisions are worked out based on results of a competition between groups of agents which, represented by binary words, navigate in a neural working memory. Each agent is endowed with a strategy of its own behavior and carries its opinion. The opinions are symbolic statements encoding facts and/or rules. A Fuzzy Knowledge Base provides rules, as well as the values of membership of given measurements to appropriate facts interpreted as fuzzy sets. At a given moment an indoctrinating device generates a fact or its negation with a probability calculated based on related membership value. A debate in the Society of Agents results in a victory of adherents of a particular solution. An ultimate decision is based on a poll. A hardware facilitating this kind of computation, as well as some simulation results are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Strategy of agent's behavior The first efficient strategy of agent's behavior was discovered via gradual improving of an inefficient initial strategy by a process of "trial and error" using a simulation model of Jigsaw Machine <ref> [7] </ref> and formalized for further analysis [6][8]. As a given agent is to navigate and interact with other agents, the strategy of the agents behavior consists of two rules: NAVIGATION RULE and INTERACTION RULE described here from an agents point of view.
