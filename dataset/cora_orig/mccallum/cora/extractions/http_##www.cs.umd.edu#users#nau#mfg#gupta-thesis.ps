Abstract: Because of pressing demands to reduce lead time and product cost, increasing research attention is being given to integration of engineering design and manufacturing. In this thesis, a systematic approach has been developed for computer-aided manufacturability analysis of machined parts. This approach can be used during design stages to improve the product quality from the manufacturing point of view. Evaluating the manufacturability of a proposed design involves determining whether or not it is manufacturable with a given set of manufacturing operations|and if so, then finding the associated manufacturing efficiency. In this research, the design is represented as a solid model. The tolerance and surface finish information is represented as attributes of various faces of the solid

Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts [58, 11, 3, 88, 9, 31, 17]. Two approaches to computer-aided process planning are traditionally recognized, the variant approach and generative approach. <p> Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts <ref> [58, 11, 3, 88, 9, 31, 17] </ref>.

Their approach is capable of handling a limited number of accessibility constraints and tolerances. Anjanappa et al. <ref> [4, 48] </ref> have developed a rapid prototyping system for 24 machined parts. The emphasis of their work was on using existing standards and available databases. The design is stored as IGES file, and a rule based feature extractor is used to find machinable features.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this end, increasing research attention is being given to integrating engineering design and manufacturing. These attempts have led to the evolution of the design for manufacturability (DFM) methodology <ref> [5] </ref>. This methodology involves simultaneously considering design goals and manufacturing constraints in order to identify and alleviate manufacturing problems while the product is being designed, thereby reducing the lead time and improving the 1 product quality. The roots of DFM date as far back as World War II [99]. <p> However, inter-departmental design teams did not always work harmoniously, many management-related problems exist in building and coordinating such teams [61]. In an attempt to increase awareness of manufacturing considerations among designers, leading professional societies have published a number of manufactura-bility guidelines for a variety of manufacturing processes <ref> [62, 8, 86, 5] </ref>. These guidelines mainly enumerate the design configurations that pose manufactura-bility problems, and are mainly intended as training tools in DFM. <p> As the advantages of concurrent engineering are being realized, more and more downstream activities associated with the various manufacturing aspects are being considered during the design phase, and DFM has become an important part of concurrent engineering <ref> [5, 89] </ref>. On of the primary goals of concurrent engineering is to build an intelligent CAD system by embedding manufacturing related information into the CAD systems.

Reference-contexts: Most of the design synthesis activities are currently performed by human designers. Several attempts have been made to automatically synthesize design solutions from functional requirements <ref> [6, 83] </ref>. However, these attempts are restricted to very narrow domains. Ideally, one would like to have a system which takes customer needs as input and automatically designs a suitable product. However, reality is far from this situation.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, as the manufacturing resources or practices change in an organization, the knowledge bases of these intelligent CAD systems could be updated automatically with least interference with the design activities of the organization. The pioneering work of Boothroyd and Dewhurst <ref> [7] </ref> in developing a comprehensive set of Design for Assembly (DFA) guidelines, has resulted in a number of successful computer-aided DFA tools [39, 42]. <p> These rules are applied to a given design in order to estimate its manufacturability. The subsequent subsections describe various automated manufacturability analysis systems for different types of manufacturing domains. 19 2.1.2 Assembly The pioneering work of Boothroyd and Dewhurst <ref> [7] </ref> in developing the design-for-assembly guidelines has resulted in several automated assembly evaluation and advisory systems. One of the earliest efforts in this direction was made by Jakiela et al. [42]. They integrated a rule-based system with a CAD system to develop a design advisory system. <p> Sturges et al. [82] have developed a new assembly evaluation methodology that attempts to overcome some of the limitations of the scheme proposed by Boothroyd and Dewhurst <ref> [7] </ref>. They have also built a semi-automated evaluation system. Currently, their system has no geometric reasoning capability. It mainly serves as an interactive environment to study the effect of various design configuration on assembly difficulty. <p> If possible, a better assembly plan is created by modifying the plan. If a 20 better plan is found, the design is modified by splitting, combining or perturb-ing various components. Compared to the work Boothroyd and Dewhurst <ref> [7] </ref>, their criteria for evaluating assembly plan is rather restricted. Their approach does not address tolerance or surface finish issues, and can only suggest minor modification to the original design.

Reference-contexts: Currently, most of the researchers agree that volumetric features capture the machining operations in much more comprehensive manner [68]. Most of current systems use volumetric machining features. One of the earliest attempts at categorizing machining features was made by CAM-I <ref> [10] </ref>. This work attempted to exhaustively enumerate process planning features for machined parts. However, this work lacked any mathematical foundation, did not establish any direct relationship among features and manufacturing operations. Over the years a number of other attempts have been made to define libraries for volumetric machining features.

Reference-contexts: Brooks et al. [9] defined another library for their process planning system called XCUT. Gindy [27] presents a feature hierarchy describing the geometric information in a class of form features for process planning. To this date, the most comprehensive methods to define machining features were developed by Chang <ref> [11] </ref>. His definition is based on tool shapes and cutting 28 trajectories. Features described in this work are very closely related to machining operations. Vandenbrande and Requicha [87] used a similar scheme to define volumetric machining features that corresponded to the tool swept volume. <p> In this approach, the designer directly models the design in terms of manufacturing features, thus obviates the need for the feature recognition. Prototype systems such as Next-Cut [17] and QTC <ref> [11] </ref> provided a feature-based design interface in which the part was directly modeled in terms of machining features. In order to analyze the design for various life-cycle considerations, the design needs to be interpreted in terms of domain dependent features. <p> Most of the early research in feature recognition and process planning ignored this aspect completely, and focused on generation of a single interpretation. Recently, generation of alternative interpretations has begun to receive some research atten 33 tion. The AMPS process planning system <ref> [11] </ref> includes a feature refinement step, in which heuristic techniques are used for combining a set of features into a more complex feature if it appears that this will optimize the plan, or splitting a feature that cannot be machined into two or more features that can (hopefully) be machined. <p> Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts <ref> [58, 11, 3, 88, 9, 31, 17] </ref>.

Twist drilling requires center drilling as its preprocess. This results in selection of center-drilling operation. The center-drilling is a terminal process, thus selection stops here. A number of process planing systems such as AMPS <ref> [11] </ref>, SIPS [58] etc. use this technique to perform process selection. 2.3.2.2 Identifying Precedence Constraints For a given part, the machining operations cannot be necessarily performed in any arbitrary order [30]. A number of geometric and technological constraints require that some operations be performed before or after certain other operations. <p> A number of geometric and technological constraints require that some operations be performed before or after certain other operations. Most process planning systems only deal with the precedence constraints among finishing and roughing operations of the same features. AMPS <ref> [11] </ref> uses heuristic techniques to determine precedence constraints among features. A number of rules based on the machining practices have been defined that are used to determine precedence constraints among the pairs of features. This approach allows strict and loose constraints. Strict constraints cannot be violated. <p> Such rules are defined for each feature. However, these rules are sufficient to guarantee the fixturability of the intermediate workpiece. Machinist also determines the optimum setup using state-space techniques. However, precedences that arise from tolerance considerations are not addressed by the system. 39 Chang <ref> [11] </ref> presented the comprehensive conditions for holding the workpiece in a vise. These conditions are based on the intermediate workpiece geometry and sufficient for successfully clamping the workpiece. He also presents an algorithm for setup planning. <p> Usually the plan ratings are based on the estimated production time and cost. 2.3.3.1 Estimating Production Cost and Time Economics plays a very important role in manufacturing planning.

Reference-contexts: The features in this approach are allowed to have multiple approach directions. Such features may require "OR" type of precedence constraints. However, this approach does not have capability to handle "OR" type of precedence constraints. Thus in some cases, it may result in over-constrainted precedences. The Machinist system <ref> [33] </ref> is capable of handling the precedences arising because of setup consideration. In this system, precedences are generated by ex 38 amining the setup interactions among features. <p> Setup planning involves determination of various setups in which the part will be machined. Some advances have been made in automated fixture design [74]. Research in fixture design mainly focuses on designing new fixtures for a given geometry. The Machinist system <ref> [33] </ref> incorporates few rules for examining the fixtura-bility in a vise. Such rules are defined for each feature. However, these rules are sufficient to guarantee the fixturability of the intermediate workpiece. Machinist also determines the optimum setup using state-space techniques.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, manual generation of more than one feature-based description 29 may lead to discrepancies among various descriptions. 2. There are a number of application domains in which the feature-based description is not unique <ref> [55, 45] </ref>.

In most cases, it will be unrealistic to assume that the designer will be an expert in a manufacturing related application. <p> This program also produces alternative features in certain cases. However, this system does not guarantee generating all potential machining features. The first systematic work in the direction of generation of alternative interpretations was done by Karinthi and Nau <ref> [45] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These techniques range from wire frame models to solid models. Solid models create the most comprehensive geometric representations of the physical objects <ref> [54, 35] </ref>. These models can be used for answering geometric questions about the physical objects. In this thesis, the nominal geometry will be represented by solid models. There are a number of schemes for representing the solid models.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, manual generation of more than one feature-based description 29 may lead to discrepancies among various descriptions. 2. There are a number of application domains in which the feature-based description is not unique <ref> [55, 45] </ref>. In order to choose the most appropriate description in these situations, the designer needs to be an expert in the application domain. In most cases, it will be unrealistic to assume that the designer will be an expert in a manufacturing related application. <p> Since the techniques are heuristic in nature, it is not entirely clear when alternative interpretations will be produced. Mantyla et al. <ref> [55] </ref> proposed the concept of feature relaxation. This concept was developed to support the idea of design by least commitment. The proposed feature relaxation groups are pairs of geometric features which are interchangeable. In this approach, the design defined in terms of relaxed features.

Reference-contexts: Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts <ref> [58, 11, 3, 88, 9, 31, 17] </ref>. Two approaches to computer-aided process planning are traditionally recognized, the variant approach and generative approach. The variant approach involves retrieving an existing plan for 35 a similar part and making the necessary modification to the plan for the new part. <p> XCUT [9] and AMPS [11] use production rules to represent process knowledge. Frames permit representation of both procedural and declarative information in terms of attributes, hierarchical relations with other frames, constraints, and procedures. SIPS <ref> [58] </ref> and NEXT-Cut [17] use frames to represent process knowledge. The process selection task is performed by examining the shape and tolerance requirements of an individual feature and selecting the process that is capable of meeting the requirements. <p> This results in selection of twist drilling. Twist drilling requires center drilling as its preprocess. This results in selection of center-drilling operation. The center-drilling is a terminal process, thus selection stops here. A number of process planing systems such as AMPS [11], SIPS <ref> [58] </ref> etc. use this technique to perform process selection. 2.3.2.2 Identifying Precedence Constraints For a given part, the machining operations cannot be necessarily performed in any arbitrary order [30]. A number of geometric and technological constraints require that some operations be performed before or after certain other operations.

In the context of manufacturability analysis systems, there are two types of potential errors that may lead to unreliable results. First, if a design has some attribute that is undesirable for the manufacturing domain but the system does not identify this attribute, then problems may arise during manufacturing.

Currently, the feature-based characterization of the design is considered vital for data exchange between design and manufacturing. In the research community, features have come to mean different things for different research projects|each adopting their own definitions and types to suit the goals of their particular application. <p> This is understandable, as there does not exist any universal feature set that satisfies requirements of all the application domains. Historically, the concept of a feature originated in the process planning of machined parts <ref> [67] </ref>. In most process planning systems, features were used to characterize the volumes or the surfaces machined by various types of machining operations. <p> Over the years, the popularity of features has grown, and they are currently being used in a wide variety of manufacturing applications such as near-net shape manufacturing, assembly, inspection planning, and, so forth. Each of these applications requires different feature definitions.

Currently, most of the researchers agree that volumetric features capture the machining operations in much more comprehensive manner <ref> [68] </ref>. Most of current systems use volumetric machining features. One of the earliest attempts at categorizing machining features was made by CAM-I [10]. This work attempted to exhaustively enumerate process planning features for machined parts.

Reference-contexts: This requires considerations of fixturing devices and formulating the conditions that are needed for proper fixturing. Setup planning involves determination of various setups in which the part will be machined. Some advances have been made in automated fixture design <ref> [74] </ref>. Research in fixture design mainly focuses on designing new fixtures for a given geometry. The Machinist system [33] incorporates few rules for examining the fixtura-bility in a vise. Such rules are defined for each feature. However, these rules are sufficient to guarantee the fixturability of the intermediate workpiece.

Reference-contexts: Sakurai [76] emphasized the need to be able to extract some form of user-defined feature types that may arise in specific applications and relates it with graph-based feature recognition.

The method, though able to handle intersecting features, is computationally expensive and difficult to prove free from pathological cases. <p> This approach is restricted to the cases that involve pairs of interchangeable features. The cases in which features can be combined to produce a new features or split into two or more features cannot be handled by this approach. The recent work of Sakurai and Chin <ref> [75] </ref> generates alternative features. However, this work does not provide means of grouping these features into feature-based models. Moreover, in some cases this approach generates a very large number of features, and does not provide any means to control the resulting combinatorial difficulties.

The task of manufacturability analy-sis requires extensive geometric reasoning. <p> Measures of Manufacturability: In many early rule-based DFM systems, qualitative or abstract quantitative measures were used to rate designs for specific manufacturing domains. For example, Ishii et al. [40] rated designs as "poor", "average", "good", or "excellent". Shanker et al. <ref> [79] </ref> proposed a scheme in which each design attribute was assigned a manufacturability index that ranged from one to two. <p> This is a very tedious job for a designer, and any error in this description may result in incorrect calculation of compatibility index. Finally, it is not clear how this approach will work in domains where a design might have multiple interpretations. Shanker et al. <ref> [79] </ref> proposed a generalized methodology to evaluate manufac-turability. Their scheme is domain independent and rates the design based on a set of core manufacturability concepts. They describe five core concepts namely, compatibility, complexity, quality, efficiency, and coupling.

Researchers have developed automated manufacturability analysis systems for a wide variety of domains. Most of these systems use rule-based approaches. Design characteristics which improve or degrade the manufacturability are represented as manufacturability rules. These rules are applied to a given design in order to estimate its manufacturability.

However, with the advent of open architecture solid modeling systems <ref> [81] </ref>, it is now possible to do the sophisticated geometric reasoning for manufacturability analysis. Research in manufacturability analysis is of paramount importance in context of CAD/CAM systems.

Reference-contexts: Although product design incurs only a small fraction of the total product cost, the decisions made during the design phase determine the significant portion of the product cost, and can be crucial to the success or failure of the product <ref> [89, 85] </ref>. Since the cost of making essential design changes escalates steeply with time, the ability to make crucial changes during the design phase translates into significant savings over making changes during production run [89].

Reference-contexts: However, inter-departmental design teams did not always work harmoniously, many management-related problems exist in building and coordinating such teams [61]. In an attempt to increase awareness of manufacturing considerations among designers, leading professional societies have published a number of manufactura-bility guidelines for a variety of manufacturing processes <ref> [62, 8, 86, 5] </ref>. These guidelines mainly enumerate the design configurations that pose manufactura-bility problems, and are mainly intended as training tools in DFM. <p> In such cases, usually the empirical methods are used. Based on the past experiences of metal cutting industries, a significant amount of data has been published that describes the achievable machining accuracy of various machining processes <ref> [11, 8, 86] </ref>. <p> error surface finish (mm) * + d (mm) (mm) (m) 6 to 13 0:150 0:025 25 to 50 0:250 0:080 Table 8.3: Location errors for drilling. drilling condition location error drilling a new hole 0.15mm enlarging a pre-existing hole 0.10mm applicable for plain carbon steels and has been compiled from <ref> [8, 11, 86, 53] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To this date, the most comprehensive methods to define machining features were developed by Chang [11]. His definition is based on tool shapes and cutting 28 trajectories. Features described in this work are very closely related to machining operations. Vandenbrande and Requicha <ref> [87] </ref> used a similar scheme to define volumetric machining features that corresponded to the tool swept volume. The standardization community has been evolving a means for describing generic classes of features for the purposes of data exchange. <p> Perhaps the most comprehensive and formal approach to date for recognizing features and handling their interactions has been that of Vandenbrande et al. <ref> [87] </ref>. Their method is capable of coming up with alternative interpretations and is described in the next section. The absence of a clear formalism for the feature recognition problem has made it difficult to ensure completeness of these approaches. <p> However, this work does not provide means of grouping these features into feature-based models. Moreover, in some cases this approach generates a very large number of features, and does not provide any means to control the resulting combinatorial difficulties. Vandenbrande and Requicha <ref> [87] </ref> have developed a system that combines techniques from artificial intelligence and solid modeling. Their program uses hints or clues to identify potential features in the boundary representation of 34 the part. The system is capable of identifying interacting features (e.g., two intersecting slots).

Reference-contexts: Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts <ref> [58, 11, 3, 88, 9, 31, 17] </ref>. Two approaches to computer-aided process planning are traditionally recognized, the variant approach and generative approach. The variant approach involves retrieving an existing plan for 35 a similar part and making the necessary modification to the plan for the new part. <p> This section only deals with the steps that are relevant to manufactura-bility analysis. For details and literature survey on the complete plan generation steps, readers are referred to <ref> [3, 11, 88] </ref>. 2.3.2.1 Process Selection The task of process selection involves selecting machining processes for the given part. Most of the existing process planning systems work with a single feature-based interpretation of the part and select machining process for each feature 36 independently. <p> For a limited number of machining processes, mechanistic models have been developed to provide quantitative mappings between the cutting parameters (such as cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut) and machining accuracy (such as surface finish and dimensional accuracy) <ref> [96, 97, 88, 59] </ref>. Zhang et al. presented [95, 96, 97, 60] a comprehensive method for predicting the machining accuracy of turning and boring operations. Their methodology can be extended to model all machining processes involving single-point cutting tools.

To achieve this end, increasing research attention is being given to integrating engineering design and manufacturing. These attempts have led to the evolution of the design for manufacturability (DFM) methodology [5]. <p> As the advantages of concurrent engineering are being realized, more and more downstream activities associated with the various manufacturing aspects are being considered during the design phase, and DFM has become an important part of concurrent engineering <ref> [5, 89] </ref>. On of the primary goals of concurrent engineering is to build an intelligent CAD system by embedding manufacturing related information into the CAD systems.

Research on machining economics has produced quantitative models for evaluating times and costs related to machining operations <ref> [91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In one of the early efforts on feature extraction, Woo <ref> [92] </ref> proposed a method for finding general depression and protrusion features on a part by decomposing the convex hull of the solid model. The approach had several problems, including being confined to polyhedral models and the existence of certain pathological cases in which the procedure would not converge.

Reference-contexts: Failure to do so may produce incorrect analysis result. In order to select the most appropriate set of features for machining, the designer needs to have good knowledge about machining processes. This requirement significantly limits the scope of this system. Yannoulakis et al. <ref> [93] </ref> have developed a manufacturability evaluation system for axi-symmetric parts to be machined on turning centers. They created a feature-based description of the part and evaluated the manufacturability index of each feature. The manufacturability index was based on the estimated machining time of the feature.

Reference-contexts: These conditions are based on the intermediate workpiece geometry and sufficient for successfully clamping the workpiece. He also presents an algorithm for setup planning. However, this algorithm is not optimal and in certain cases may generate setup plans that are not optimal.

These conditions are based on intermediate workpiece geometry and include friction force considerations. 2.3.3 Plan Evaluation After generating the plan, the next step is to evaluate the plan.

Reference-contexts: Research on machining economics has produced quantitative models for evaluating times and costs related to machining operations [91]. Various optimization 40 techniques have been applied to these quantitative models to seek the machining parameters which minimize the variable cost, or maximize the production rate and profit rate <ref> [98, 1, 2] </ref>. The total production time associated with machining operations consists of two components, the machining time and the auxiliary time. The machining time refers to the portion of production time in which the cutting tool engages in metal removal operation. <p> The variable cost consists of the costs which vary in accordance with the level of production activity. Typical examples of variable cost would be the cost related to the machining activities, tooling, and auxiliary activities. The variable cost is directly related to the production cost <ref> [98] </ref>. Estimating the fixed cost involves the vast amount of information, and is a challenging problem. Currently, in most cost models very simplistic estimates are used to estimate the fixed cost.

Scarcity of resources, and constant social and political pressure to build better weapons in the shortest possible turnaround time were the main motivating factors behind the tight integration of design and manufacturing activities.

However, with the the post-World War II era of prosperity and the resultant rapid growth of industry size came the segregation of design and manufacturing departments, which resulted in a sequential product development environment with little attention to DFM.
