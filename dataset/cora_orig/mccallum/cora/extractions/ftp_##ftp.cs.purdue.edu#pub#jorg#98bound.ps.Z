Title: Sharp, quantitative bounds on the distance between a polynomial piece and its Bezier control polygon  
Author: D. Nairn J. Peters D. Lutterkort 
Date: September 16, 1998  
Abstract: The maximal distance between a Bezier segment and its control polygon is bounded in terms of the differences of the control point sequence and a constant that depends only on the degree of the polynomial. The constants derived here for various norms and orders of differences are the smallest possible. In particular, the bound in terms of the maximal absolute second difference of the control points is a sharp upper bound for the Hausdorff distance between the control polygon and the curve segment, it provides a straightforward proof of quadratic convergence of the sequence of control polygons to the Bezier segment under subdivision or degree-fold degree-raising and establishes the explicit convergence constants, and it allows analyzing the optimal choice of the subdivision parameter for adaptive refinement of quadratic and cubic segments and yields efficient bounding regions.

Reference-contexts: Thus the convex hull yields a bound on the distance between curve segment and control polygon. The subdivision property gives a stable way of approximating the curve through a sequence of refinements of the control polygon using fixed-weight, finite averaging. Approximation rates for this process have been established in <ref> [1] </ref> and by the careful analysis in [12]. Either result yields qualitative assurance that the approximation will improve under subdivision, but the corresponding quantitative estimates are too coarse for practical use.

The next lemma reveals the exact rate and constant of convergence. Lemma 7.1 Let ` 2d be the control polygon of the d-fold degree-raised representation of the polynomial p of degree d.

Reference-contexts: The estimate is easily computed in terms of a constant N 1 (d) that depends only on the degree d and the maximum second difference of the coefficient sequence. Some definitions are in order (c.f. <ref> [5] </ref>, [2]). A univariate, scalar-valued, polynomial of degree d is in Bernstein-Bezier form if p (t) := i=0 i (t) where B d i (t) := i (1 t) di t i .

Reference-contexts: The proof technique applies to uniform B-splines <ref> [10] </ref> and extends to several variables, not just by tensoring. The new bound has potential to yield tighter, more effective localization and bounding boxes. Whether such bounding boxes are effective in practice depends on the domain-specific trade-off between computational effort and accuracy.
