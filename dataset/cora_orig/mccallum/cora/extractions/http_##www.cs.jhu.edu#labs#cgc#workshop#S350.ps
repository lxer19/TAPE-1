Title: A Duality between Small-Face Problems in Arrangements of Lines and Heilbronn-Type Problems  
Author: Gill Barequet 
Abstract: In this paper we show a duality between small-face problems in arrangements (bounded in the unit square) and Heilbronn-type problems. We use probabilistic methods and some constructions for obtaining lower and upper bounds, and summarize the known bounds for these problems.
