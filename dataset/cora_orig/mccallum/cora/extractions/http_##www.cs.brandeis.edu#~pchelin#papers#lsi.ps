Title: Can Linguistic Information Improve Latent Semantic Indexing Technique?

Abstract: Given the inherent ambiguity of natural languages, automatic categorization of corpora can be difficult. Merely the ordering of words alone can provide a combinatorial abyss difficult to escape from. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) deals with this difficulty by detecting a latent semantic fingerprint that relates documents with similar themes. We believe that using linguistic knowledge to differentiate between the meanings of the words can further improve Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) technique.
