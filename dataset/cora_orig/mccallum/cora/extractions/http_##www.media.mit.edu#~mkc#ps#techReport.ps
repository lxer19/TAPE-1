Reference-contexts: Classical supervised learning is an example of such a learning system. 2.1 Direct Inverse Modeling of a Convex Solution Space Solution regions and learnability are well-studied characteristics in the machine learning community; see for example, <ref> [Anthony and Biggs, 1992, Haussler, 1989, Minsky and Papert, 1969] </ref>. A solution set X is said to be convex if and only if there exist three co-linear points p; q; r such that, if p 2 X and r 2 X, then q 2 X; otherwise the region is non-convex.

Reference-contexts: Although we develop our examples in terms of recovering physically parameterized data for a sound model, it is also possible that more abstract feature mappings could be learned, such as those described by <ref> [Grey, 1975] </ref>. The learning paradigms presented below are suitable for parameterized mappings to many classes of sound model. 2 Direct Inverse Modeling The obvious starting point for the problem of learning to map a sound to a parametric representation is to use the direct inverse modeling strategy. <p> For more sophisticated applications of inverse modeling for audio data, we would need to develop perceptual error measures, ensuring that the machine makes judgements that are perceptually valid in human terms; see, for example, <ref> [Grey, 1975, Lee and Wessel, 1992] </ref>. 2.2 Direct Inverse Modeling of a Non-Convex Solution Space By adding another degree of freedom to the violin string model we made the task of learning the inverse model a much harder problem.

Reference-contexts: The stop position for each of the waveforms was expressed as distance along the string. The direct inverse model was implemented as a two-layer feed-forward network with biases, utilizing the generalized delta-rule as a learning algorithm, <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. There were 61 linear input units, one for each sample of the sound intention y ? , 20 logistic hidden units and a single linear output unit for the stop position.

Reference-contexts: therefore convex, since for every sampled waveform that was produced using the physical model, there was only one stop-parameter value. 3 The violin string model was implemented using a discrete version of the wave equation efficiently computed using digital waveguides and linear time-invariant filters for damping, dispersion and resonance characteristics: <ref> [Smith, 1986, Smith, 1992] </ref>, see Figure 3. The parameterization of the violin model is given in Table 1. A single string can be modeled with a bi-directional delay line representing the right (top) and left (bottom) traveling components of the wave.
