Reference-contexts: Already in the work of Doo and Sabin [12, 13] and Catmull and Clark [5] attempts were made to analyze smoothness properties of the subdivision surfaces around extraordinary vertices. A more systematic approach was taken by Ball and Storry <ref> [2] </ref>, who established conditions for tangent plane continuity of Catmull-Clark subdivision. A similar analysis was performed by Loop [41]. Most recently, important results were obtained by Reif [54, 55, 56]. <p> Our criteria generalize and unify most of the known smoothness conditions at extraordinary points. Our main result is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for tangent plane continuity and C 1 -continuity. While various conditions were known before <ref> [2, 29, 55] </ref>, they typically required some strong additional assumptions on the structure of the subdivision matrix, which we eliminate. We prove two sets of necessary and 12 sufficient conditions: Theorem 3.4, and Corollary 3.5 with equivalent Theorem 3.7. Theorem 3.4) gives necessary and sufficient conditions with minimal assumptions. <p> 1 ) ^ ~u 2 2 ^ ~u 1 1 ^ (~u 1 1 ); [w (y)] + ) Note that the limit lim s!1 N (y 1 s ) is [0; 0; 1] if all four vectors are independent; if u 1 2 = u 2 the limit is <ref> [0; 0; 2] </ref>. For N (y 2 s ) we get [1; 0; 0] if all four vectors are independent; if u 1 2 = u 2 we get [2; 0; 0]. <p> For N (y 2 s ) we get [1; 0; 0] if all four vectors are independent; if u 1 2 = u 2 we get <ref> [2; 0; 0] </ref>. In either case, the sequences of unit normals [N (y 1 s )] + and [N (y 2 s )] + converge to different limits. In the case of two independent vectors among u j i the argument is similar. <p> For irrational =2, this follows from the well-known fact (see for example, Hardy [30]) that for any * &gt; 0, t 2 <ref> [0; 2] </ref> and arbitrary large s, there is an s 0 such that js mod 2 tj &lt; *. If =2 is rational, then the function is periodic, and unless it is constant, which is impossible, we can choose two constant subsequences of linearly independent vectors. <p> Useful examples of non-invariant schemes are Hoppe's piecewise smooth Loop scheme and Loop's scheme with creases proposed in this work. The constructions of this section follow the ideas of Ball and Storry <ref> [2] </ref>; some of them were presented in [66]. Similar constructions are presented by Peters and Reif [49]. However, in most common situations there is no restriction on isomorphisms that can be used.

Reference-contexts: A related idea was used by B. Barsky <ref> [3] </ref> for fi-splines, who added tension parameters to the spline basis functions. In both cases it is not necessary to increases the number of control points of a surface to introduce a crease; only manipulation of the tags or tension parameters is required.

Reference-contexts: This difference is then represented with respect to the local frame F i to obtain coordinate independence. Since detail vectors are sampled on the fine level mesh V i , this transformation yields an overrepresentation in the spirit of the Burt-Adelson Laplacian pyramid <ref> [4] </ref>. The only difference is that the smoothing filters (Taubin) are not the dual of the subdivision filter (Loop). Theoretically, it would be possible to subsample the detail vectors and only record a detail per odd vertex of M i1 . This is what happens in the wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis our main focus is on the analysis of C 1 -continuity and construction of stationary subdivision algorithms. This class of algorithms is particularly important because all classical subdivision schemes <ref> [13, 5, 20, 40] </ref> are stationary. Understanding the algorithms in this class is essential for understanding more general forms of subdivision. Although subdivision was introduced as a generalization of knot insertion algorithms for splines, it is much more general and allows considerable freedom in the choice of subdivision rules. <p> former are typically based on generalizations of spline patch-based schemes, while the latter are related to 1D interpolating schemes [9, 10, 11, 14, 16]. 1.4.1 Approximating Subdivision Schemes The first subdivision algorithms for meshes of arbitrary topology were given by Doo and Sabin [12, 13, 57] and Catmull and Clark <ref> [5] </ref>. These were based on generalizations of quadratic and cubic B-spline subdivision for meshes consisting of quadrilaterals. The behavior around extraordinary vertices was first analyzed by Doo and Sabin [13] using Fourier 8 transforms and an analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix associated with the subdivision process. <p> Already in the work of Doo and Sabin [12, 13] and Catmull and Clark <ref> [5] </ref> attempts were made to analyze smoothness properties of the subdivision surfaces around extraordinary vertices. A more systematic approach was taken by Ball and Storry [2], who established conditions for tangent plane continuity of Catmull-Clark subdivision. A similar analysis was performed by Loop [41]. <p> These approaches cannot be used to analyze schemes that do not have explicit formulas for parameterizations in the regular case. 1.6 Related Work: Surface Editing Our system is inspired by a number of earlier approaches. We mention multiresolution editing [23, 25, 27], arbitrary topology subdivision <ref> [5, 13, 20, 35, 40, 66] </ref>, wavelet representations [7, 22, 42, 58], and mesh simplification [31, 37]. Independently, an approach similar to ours was developed by Pulli and Lounsbery [52]. H-splines were presented in pioneering work on hierarchical editing by Forsey and Bar-tels [25]. <p> Now the standard Catmull-Clark rules <ref> [5] </ref> (vertex, edge and face rule) are used as follows: the vertex rule is used to compute the values p j+1 (v) at vertices v 2 V j , the edge rules are used to compute midpoints of tagged edges, and the face rule is used to compute the midpoint of

Reference-contexts: Once the triangular case is understood, it is relatively easy to adapt the derivations for the quadrilateral schemes. Powerful tools exist for analysis and construction of subdivision schemes on regular grids (see <ref> [6] </ref>). We concentrate on the analysis of the behavior of subdivision near the extraordinary vertices. mesh, except for the shaded ones, can be mapped to the regular grid with a boundary. <p> Our analysis of stationary subdivision around extraordinary vertices builds on the ideas from the work of Warren [63, 62], Reif [55, 54, 56] and Cavaretta, Dahmen and Miccelli <ref> [6] </ref>. 6 Our main results include * A formalism for description of subdivision schemes on arbitrary meshes in terms of graph neighborhoods (Section 2.2), which allows us to define such crucial concepts as control sets (extension to the case of general subdivision of the idea of the set of control points <p> A subdivision surface is the limit function of subdivision on a complex K with values in R 3 . In this case we will call the initial values p 0 (v) the control points of the surface. Similar to Theorem 2.1 of <ref> [6] </ref> we can represent any limit function of subdivision as a linear combination of basis functions. <p> Note that in the case k = 6 (regular complex) our definition is weaker than the standard definition of stationary subdivision on regular complexes <ref> [6] </ref>. As we will see, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix have fundamental importance for smoothness of subdivision. Eigenbasis functions. let 0 ; i ; : : : J be different eigenvalues of the subdivision matrix. The following lemma can be easily proved Lemma 2.1. <p> A simple, but very useful fact (Theorem 2.8) provides us with a representation of limit functions of subdivision as linear combinations of a set of basis functions. This is a straightforward generalization of a similar fact proved for regular complexes in <ref> [6] </ref>. We show that for locally defined subdivision the questions of convergence and tangent plane continuity and C k -continuity of subdivision surfaces can be answered for any complex if the answer is known for k-regular complexes. <p> On the boundary, it is also sufficient to analyze two cases: regular and k-regular complexes with boundary. The regular case is described in detail for functional subdivision by Cavaretta, Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [6] </ref>. The second case did not receive much attention until recently. <p> We call S the subdivision matrix of S on R k . Note that our definition differs from the definition of stationary subdivision on regular complexes which can be found for example in <ref> [6] </ref>. Our definition is somewhat weaker. Example. The following matrix is the subdivision matrix for the Loop scheme on the 3-regular complex. <p> Next, we demonstrate how the difference between a linear approximation and the limit map can be estimated using contractivity with respect to a suitably chosen function, following <ref> [6] </ref> and [18]. We derive explicit formulas for the convergence rate for two classes of schemes: traditional uniform stationary schemes and a particular class of nonuniform schemes schemes with creases. In particular, our estimates allow us to prove smoothness of a parameterized family of subdivision schemes on the regular complexes. <p> First, we note that Theorem 3.1 from <ref> [6] </ref> works also if the Haar subdivision scheme H l;m , where (l; m) is one of six points adjacent to (0,0) on three-directional grid, used as a comparison scheme Definition 4.1. <p> Convergence, however, is obvious, and basis functions satisfy a trivial scaling relation. The domains of the basis functions are shown in 4.1; each function is constant and equal to 1 on its domain. Stability of Haar subdivision is obvious. If the comparison scheme B in Theorem 3.1 from <ref> [6] </ref> is taken to be H l;m , S still converges and the estimate for the convergence rate is the same as in [6]. Theorem 4.4. <p> Stability of Haar subdivision is obvious. If the comparison scheme B in Theorem 3.1 from <ref> [6] </ref> is taken to be H l;m , S still converges and the estimate for the convergence rate is the same as in [6]. Theorem 4.4. Suppose S is a convergent subdivision scheme on a complex K with jKj being a subset of the plane satisfying the conditions of Lemma 4.2. <p> As it was shown in <ref> [6] </ref>, under sufficiently general assumptions subdivision converges geometrically. <p> We use the contraction function D (p) = max ( fl (1;0) p fl fl fl 1 ) 139 y 1 y 2 p 0 , where [ (k;l) p] ij = p i+k j+l p ij , to be able to use convergence estimates of Theorem 3.1 <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> To calculate the number of steps necessary to approximate the limit surface to a given precision, we need to find an expression for constants fl and c. 141 Estimates of fl. For uniform stationary subdivision on regular complexes, we use the techniques of Cavaretta, Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [6] </ref> and Dyn, Levin and Micchelli [21] to estimate the constants in the formulas above. In this section we use notation S a for a stationary uniform subdivision scheme with the Laurent polynomial a (z). Consider a scheme S a . <p> In all estimates above we need to compute the L-infinity norm of Laurent polynomials for powers of subdivision schemes. These norms can be computed using the formulas <ref> [6] </ref> fl fl i;j ; 0 i; j 2 N 1 ; ba N = k;l fi i2 N k;j2 N l fi where a N i;j are the coefficients of a (z)a (z 2 ) a (z 2 N1 ). <p> It is clear from this definition that the scheme is stationary but not uniform. The crucial observation for analysis of schemes of this type is that Theorem 3.1 from <ref> [6] </ref> and the estimates 4.10 do not use the assumption that the scheme is uniform. However, the lack of translation invariance does not allow us to use Laurent polynomials to represent the schemes. <p> Intuitively, it appears that polynomial schemes have maximal smoothness among 261 all schemes with given support. A proof of this fact in the one-dimensional case can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. We are not aware of a proof in the two-dimensional case; a theorem like this would finally answer the question of the minimal possible support for a C 2 scheme. Limitations of stationary subdivision make it desirable to extend the theory to some classes of non-stationary schemes.

Reference-contexts: Next, we demonstrate how the difference between a linear approximation and the limit map can be estimated using contractivity with respect to a suitably chosen function, following [6] and <ref> [18] </ref>. We derive explicit formulas for the convergence rate for two classes of schemes: traditional uniform stationary schemes and a particular class of nonuniform schemes schemes with creases. In particular, our estimates allow us to prove smoothness of a parameterized family of subdivision schemes on the regular complexes. <p> Thick triangle boundaries are included in the domain; each function is 1 inside the domain and 0 outside. 131 Proof. For the regular complex we introduce the difference scheme d 1 , following Dyn and Levin <ref> [18] </ref>: (d 1 p)(v ij ) 1 = 2 k (p k ij ) i (j+1) p k (4.5) If S is C 1 there is a matrix subdivision scheme S (1) such that d 1 p k+1 = S (1) d 1 p k is convergent.

Reference-contexts: This restriction makes the implementation highly efficient and also makes the analysis of the schemes much simpler.

Subdivision in its pure form is useful for generating smooth surfaces.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis our main focus is on the analysis of C 1 -continuity and construction of stationary subdivision algorithms. This class of algorithms is particularly important because all classical subdivision schemes <ref> [13, 5, 20, 40] </ref> are stationary. Understanding the algorithms in this class is essential for understanding more general forms of subdivision. Although subdivision was introduced as a generalization of knot insertion algorithms for splines, it is much more general and allows considerable freedom in the choice of subdivision rules. <p> The sufficient conditions of Chapter 4 do not require knowledge of the explicit formula for the limit surface, which makes it useful for analysis of interpolating subdivision schemes, such as the Butterfly scheme <ref> [20] </ref>. <p> Among the patch-based schemes only Peters [47] recently gave one which can incorporate interpolation constraints without requiring the solution of a global linear system. Until recently the only known interpolating scheme was the Butterfly scheme of Dyn, Gregory and Levin <ref> [20] </ref> and a later variant [17]. These schemes are interpolating by design, local, and simple in terms of the required data structures and algorithms. They are also known to be smooth in the regular setting, where they lead to C 1 -continuous limit functions [17, 21]. <p> These approaches cannot be used to analyze schemes that do not have explicit formulas for parameterizations in the regular case. 1.6 Related Work: Surface Editing Our system is inspired by a number of earlier approaches. We mention multiresolution editing [23, 25, 27], arbitrary topology subdivision <ref> [5, 13, 20, 35, 40, 66] </ref>, wavelet representations [7, 22, 42, 58], and mesh simplification [31, 37]. Independently, an approach similar to ours was developed by Pulli and Lounsbery [52]. H-splines were presented in pioneering work on hierarchical editing by Forsey and Bar-tels [25]. <p> The control sets for a triangle for the Loop scheme and for the Butterfly scheme of Dyn, Gregory and Levin <ref> [20] </ref> are shown in Figure 2.9.

It turns out that this scheme produces C 1 surfaces only for extraordinary vertices of valences 4, 5 and 7.

In this section we use notation S a for a stationary uniform subdivision scheme with the Laurent polynomial a (z). Consider a scheme S a . Assume that a (z) is divided by 1 + z 1 2 . <p> However, the general structure of the algorithm remains the same although the details become more complicated. 6.3 Butterfly Scheme In this section we analyze the C 1 -continuity of the Butterfly scheme of Dyn, Gregory and Levin <ref> [20, 21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that our methods rely on the finest-level mesh having subdivision connectivity. This requires a remeshing step before external high resolution geometry can be imported into the editor. Eck et al. <ref> [22] </ref>, have described a possible approach to remeshing arbitrary finest level input meshes fully automatically. A method that relies on a user's expertise was developed by Krishnamurthy and Levoy [37]. 1.4 Related Work: Construction of Subdivision Schemes In this section we briefly review a number of subdivision algorithms. <p> We mention multiresolution editing [23, 25, 27], arbitrary topology subdivision [5, 13, 20, 35, 40, 66], wavelet representations <ref> [7, 22, 42, 58] </ref>, and mesh simplification [31, 37]. Independently, an approach similar to ours was developed by Pulli and Lounsbery [52]. H-splines were presented in pioneering work on hierarchical editing by Forsey and Bar-tels [25].

Wavelets provide a framework in which multiresolution approximations can be rigorously defined. Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [23] </ref>, for example, used B-spline wavelets to describe multiresolution editing of curves. As in H-splines, parameterization of details with respect to a coordinate frame induced by the coarser level approximation is required to get correct editing semantics.

Reference-contexts: To edit a given model, it is important to have a general procedure to define coarser levels and compute details between levels. We refer to this as the analysis algorithm. An H-spline analysis algorithm based on weighted least squares was introduced <ref> [24] </ref>, but is too expensive to run interactively. Note that even in for ab initio design online analysis is needed, since after a long sequence of editing steps the H-spline is likely to be overly refined and needs to be consolidated. <p> Our work extends H-splines of Forsey and Bartels to arbitrary topology meshes. Similar work was independently done by Pulli and Lounsbery [52]; our work also bears similarity to an earlier paper of Kurihara [38]. Most of the previous work focused on ab initio design with the exception of <ref> [24] </ref>. We introduce efficient algorithms for analysis based on Taubin's smoothing, which are essential for manipulating high-resolution meshes. <p> s i1 = H s i : Several options are available here: * Least squares: One could define analysis to be optimal in the least squares sense, min ks i S s i1 k 2 : The solution may have unwanted undulations and is too expensive to compute inter actively <ref> [24] </ref>. * Fairing: A coarse surface could be obtained as the solution to a global variational problem. This is too expensive as well. An alternative is presented by Taubin [61], who uses a local non-shrinking smoothing approach.

Briefly, H-splines are obtained by adding finer resolution B-splines onto an existing coarser resolution B-spline patch relative to the coordinate frame induced by the coarser patch. Repeating this process, one can build very complicated shapes which are entirely parameterized over the unit square.

Reference-contexts: Abstract complexes closely match data structures used for implementation of subdivision, and in this sense our somewhat more abstract approach turns out to be more practical. Our definitions are similar to those found in introductory algebraic topology texts such as Giblin <ref> [26] </ref>. The only non-trivial restriction that we impose on the complex is that the triangles of the complex adjacent to a vertex should form one ring. It is easy to see that any mesh can be converted to a mesh of this type by replicating some vertices and triangles.

Reference-contexts: Another important source of ideas for this work was the manuscript by Warren [63], 10 where he noted the importance of scaling relations for understanding behavior of subdivision schemes around extraordinary vertices. Reif's criterion was used to analyze C 1 -continuity of subdivision schemes by Habib and Warren <ref> [28] </ref>, Schweitzer [59], Peters and Reif [49]. Prautzsch [50] presents sufficient conditions for C k -continuity that form a subset of our conditions. The differences between our work and the work of Prautzsch are discussed in Section 1.6.1. <p> A degree estimate for C k -continuous polynomial schemes was published by Prautzsch and Reif [51]. Reif's sufficient conditions for C 1 -continuity of subdivision schemes requires establishing injectivity and regularity of the characteristic map. In <ref> [28] </ref> and [49] this was achieved using explicit representation of the surface with polynomial patches. Techniques developed by Schweitzer [59] are more subtle, but still rely on closed-form expressions.

Reference-contexts: Nasri [45] gives modifications to the quadratic scheme of Doo-Sabin to enforce interpolation of vertices and normals by solving a linear system which is global but sparse. Similarly, Halstead, Kass and DeRose <ref> [29] </ref> give an algorithm modifying the cubic scheme of Catmull-Clark to enforce positional and normal constraints, again by solving a global and sparse linear system. In both cases there are a number of limitations. <p> Our criteria generalize and unify most of the known smoothness conditions at extraordinary points. Our main result is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for tangent plane continuity and C 1 -continuity. While various conditions were known before <ref> [2, 29, 55] </ref>, they typically required some strong additional assumptions on the structure of the subdivision matrix, which we eliminate. We prove two sets of necessary and 12 sufficient conditions: Theorem 3.4, and Corollary 3.5 with equivalent Theorem 3.7. Theorem 3.4) gives necessary and sufficient conditions with minimal assumptions.

Reference-contexts: Interactivity, which is crucial in these cases, is challenging to achieve. Even without accounting for any computation on the mesh itself, available rendering resources alone may not be able to cope with the sheer size of the data. Possible approaches include mesh optimization <ref> [33, 31] </ref> to reduce the size of the meshes and using hierarchical representations, such as the subdivision-based representation that we propose. Our representation is more suitable for editing and animation applications: different levels of resolution can be extracted on the fly, even if the geometry changes. <p> We mention multiresolution editing [23, 25, 27], arbitrary topology subdivision [5, 13, 20, 35, 40, 66], wavelet representations [7, 22, 42, 58], and mesh simplification <ref> [31, 37] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Tagged complexes can be used to define schemes with creases such as the one described in <ref> [32] </ref>, and to reduce other types of refinement rules (Catmull-Clark, Doo-Sabin) to refinement of simplicial complexes (Appendix A). Subdivision schemes. <p> The second condition of the corollary directly follows from Theorem 3.4. There are some interesting cases for which the assumptions of Corollary 3.5 are not satisfied; most notable exception are piecewise smooth schemes of the type described by H.Hoppe and others <ref> [32] </ref>. The assumption is easy to verify for piecewise polynomial schemes, as for such schemes Jacobians also can be expressed in polynomial bases, and the nondegener-acy assumption is reduced to checking independence of vectors of control values for the Jacobians. <p> When a smooth feature is introduced, it is typically done by increasing the number of control points on the surface near the crease. An alternative method of introducing sharp edges into a subdivision surface was proposed by Hoppe et al. <ref> [32] </ref>; the main idea of the approach is to modify the subdivision rules near tagged edges of the initial mesh so that the limit surface becomes non-smooth at that edge. A related idea was used by B. Barsky [3] for fi-splines, who added tension parameters to the spline basis functions.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach is to represent the numbers as intervals. The ideas of interval arithmetic date back at least to Moore's work [43], [44]. The IEEE 754 standard made possible consistent and efficient implementations on a variety of hardware (e.g., PROFIL/BLAS package <ref> [34] </ref>). A number of approaches can be used to implement this type of arithmetic. One approach would be to use IEEE standard operations "round to +1" and "round to 1" to compute the upper and lower bounds of the intervals, as suggested in [60].

Reference-contexts: The failure to be C 1 -continuous 9 for vertices of valence other than six is easily observed in practice as can be seen in the example of Figure 1.4. Simultaneously with this work a new quadrilateral-based interpolating scheme was developed by Kobbelt <ref> [35] </ref>. result after several levels of subdivision using the Butterfly scheme.

Reference-contexts: We say that a system of functions f m (~) satisfies ( 1 ; 2 )-scaling relation for 0 if it satisfies (3.26). Functions of this type are well-know in singularity theory; Newton diagrams described below were used to study quasihomogeneous functions by Kushnirenko <ref> [39] </ref>. The derivatives of functions satisfying a scaling relation do not satisfy a scaling relation themselves, but their scaled versions do. This allows us to establish the following Lemma 3.15.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis our main focus is on the analysis of C 1 -continuity and construction of stationary subdivision algorithms. This class of algorithms is particularly important because all classical subdivision schemes <ref> [13, 5, 20, 40] </ref> are stationary. Understanding the algorithms in this class is essential for understanding more general forms of subdivision. Although subdivision was introduced as a generalization of knot insertion algorithms for splines, it is much more general and allows considerable freedom in the choice of subdivision rules. <p> The behavior around extraordinary vertices was first analyzed by Doo and Sabin [13] using Fourier 8 transforms and an analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix associated with the subdivision process. A first scheme for arbitrary meshes consisting of triangles was given by Loop <ref> [40] </ref>. It is based on a generalization of quartic triangular B-splines. Another class of approaches to generating smooth surfaces from arbitrary topology meshes attempts to directly derive a set of spline patches which globally achieve some order of continuity. <p> These approaches cannot be used to analyze schemes that do not have explicit formulas for parameterizations in the regular case. 1.6 Related Work: Surface Editing Our system is inspired by a number of earlier approaches.

Independently, an approach similar to ours was developed by Pulli and Lounsbery [52]. H-splines were presented in pioneering work on hierarchical editing by Forsey and Bar-tels [25]. <p> Example. One of the simplest and useful subdivision schemes satisfying Conditions 1-3 is the Loop scheme (Loop <ref> [40] </ref>). The stencils and coefficients for a variant of the scheme are shown in Figure 2.8. Different stencils are used for computing values at four types of vertices: 33 new boundaryold boundary old interal new internal d 1=8 1=8 1=2 1=8 d d d d with circles. <p> Details about the scheme can be found in Loop <ref> [40] </ref>). 34 2.2.2 Control and Localization Sets In this section we introduce the control sets of sets of vertices of subdivided complexes. It is sufficient to define the values at the control set of a set W to compute with subdivision all values on W . <p> The regular case is described in detail for functional subdivision by Cavaretta, Dahmen and Micchelli [6]. The second case did not receive much attention until recently. Relevant literature includes works by Loop, Warren, Kobbelt, Reif <ref> [40, 63, 36, 55] </ref>. 2.4 Subdivision Matrix In this section we introduce the subdivision matrix, which is the matrix that relates the values on the localization set of the topological 1-neighborhood of zero in the k-regular complex to the values on the similar neighborhood on the next subdivision level. <p> Note that errors level out quite quickly; this indicates that the difference between normalized maps for large valences is quite small. 218 6.5 Loop Scheme This scheme was introduced in C. Loop's thesis <ref> [40] </ref>. This is one of the simplest known C 1 -continuous subdivision schemes. On the regular mesh this scheme generates degree 4 triangular splines. Tangent plane continuity (existence of limit normals) of this scheme was analyzed in Loop's thesis. <p> Observations that we make in this section lead to improved versions of Loop scheme described in the next section. 6.5.1 Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, Convergence Rates Many facts stated in this section can be found in <ref> [40] </ref> and [59]. We reproduce these facts here for completeness. The Loop scheme was defined in Section 2.2. The control and localization sizes for Loop scheme are both 2.

Reference-contexts: One approach would be to use IEEE standard operations "round to +1" and "round to 1" to compute the upper and lower bounds of the intervals, as suggested in [60]. Another approach was implemented in the RealExpr package described in [65] and in detail in <ref> [46] </ref> the BigFloat representation for numbers. A distinctive feature of this package is that it does not rely on the hardware floating point and uses an arbitrary-length integer representation for mantissas instead. <p> Part of this section is adopted from the work of Ouchi <ref> [46] </ref>. Let B = 2 c , where c = bL=2c 2, L is the number of bits used for representing an integer. <p> Unfortunately, this is not computationally feasible, and in some cases compromise formulas for computing z are adopted, which attempt to minimize the error without sacrificing the performance. The formulas for the arithmetic operators are derived in <ref> [46] </ref>. Here we describe the formulas for addition/subtraction and multiplication; the formulas for division are quite complex and can be found in the cited work. Addition/Subtraction.

C 1 -Continuity as defined in Section 3.1 was established using Reif's criterion and analytic methods for valences up to 100 by J. Schweitzer <ref> [59] </ref>. In this section we use our algorithms to establish C 1 -continuity of Loop scheme for arbitrary valence. <p> Observations that we make in this section lead to improved versions of Loop scheme described in the next section. 6.5.1 Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, Convergence Rates Many facts stated in this section can be found in [40] and <ref> [59] </ref>. We reproduce these facts here for completeness. The Loop scheme was defined in Section 2.2. The control and localization sizes for Loop scheme are both 2. <p> We leave construction and analysis of such schemes as a direction for future work. As the expressions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the crease scheme for k = 1 are known <ref> [59] </ref>, we were able to prove one-sided C 1 -continuity of Loop scheme with sharp creases for arbitrary valence. The results are very similar to those obtained in the previous sections of r symmetric schemes, with the only difference that two parameters have to be considered. <p> Thus it would be more natural to define neighborhoods on the dual complexes. Boundary case. All derivations in Chapter 3 were performed for an extraordinary vertex in the interior of the surface. The same methods can be used to consider the vertices on the boundary; although Schweitzer <ref> [59] </ref> applied Reif's conditions to vertices on the boundary, a careful theoretical analysis was never performed in that case.

Reference-contexts: A number of approaches can be used to implement this type of arithmetic. One approach would be to use IEEE standard operations "round to +1" and "round to 1" to compute the upper and lower bounds of the intervals, as suggested in <ref> [60] </ref>. Another approach was implemented in the RealExpr package described in [65] and in detail in [46] the BigFloat representation for numbers. A distinctive feature of this package is that it does not rely on the hardware floating point and uses an arbitrary-length integer representation for mantissas instead.

Reference-contexts: A possible approach to improving the performance of the algorithm is to refine analysis of Chapter 4; rather than using worst case estimates, one can try to decompose surfaces on regular grids into suitably chosen combinations of basis functions corresponding to different frequencies; as it was observed by Taubin <ref> [61] </ref>, high-frequency components of surfaces are typically small. The same observation applies to characteristic maps of practically useful subdivision schemes. One may expect that significantly better convergence estimates can be obtained for interpolating schemes restricted to low-frequency initial data. This will lead to better estimates for general surfaces. <p> In this chapter we describe algorithms for implementing subdivision and a multiresolution representation closely related to subdivision. Combining subdivision and the smoothing algorithms of Taubin <ref> [61] </ref> allows us to construct a set of algorithms for interactive multires-olution editing of complex hierarchical meshes of arbitrary topology. The simplicity of the underlying algorithms for refinement and coarsification enables us to make them local and adaptive, thereby considerably improving their efficiency. <p> This is too expensive as well. An alternative is presented by Taubin <ref> [61] </ref>, who uses a local non-shrinking smoothing approach. Because of its computational simplicity, we decided to use a version of Taubin smoothing. As before let v 2 V i have k neighbors v m 2 V i .

Our work extends and generalizes the work of Reif. Another important source of ideas for this work was the manuscript by Warren <ref> [63] </ref>, 10 where he noted the importance of scaling relations for understanding behavior of subdivision schemes around extraordinary vertices. Reif's criterion was used to analyze C 1 -continuity of subdivision schemes by Habib and Warren [28], Schweitzer [59], Peters and Reif [49]. <p> Our notation is similar to the notation of Warren <ref> [63] </ref>. Exposition in the chapter is rather detailed; some of the constructions are more general than it is required in the rest of the thesis. <p> The regular case is described in detail for functional subdivision by Cavaretta, Dahmen and Micchelli [6]. The second case did not receive much attention until recently. Relevant literature includes works by Loop, Warren, Kobbelt, Reif <ref> [40, 63, 36, 55] </ref>. 2.4 Subdivision Matrix In this section we introduce the subdivision matrix, which is the matrix that relates the values on the localization set of the topological 1-neighborhood of zero in the k-regular complex to the values on the similar neighborhood on the next subdivision level. <p> We assume that 0 6= 0. The following lemma is the basis of our derivations. This lemma extends a similar lemma by Warren <ref> [63] </ref>. Lemma 3.14.

Reference-contexts: The original constructions were limited to piecewise linear subdivision, but smoother constructions are possible [58, 66]. An approach to surface modeling based on variational methods was proposed by Welch and Witkin <ref> [64] </ref>. An attractive characteristic of their method is flexibility in the choice of control points. However, they use a global optimization procedure to compute the surface which is not suitable for interactive manipulation of complex surfaces. 1.6.1 Comparison with Previous Work Subdivision Theory.
