Reference-contexts: When the sample values are ranks, r = r s , and [55] r s = 1 N s P (X j Y j ) 2 s 1) The range of r s is <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. The value 1 corresponds to complete disagreement between the two rankings, and the value 1 indicates complete agreement. <p> The Kendall's t is defined as the ratio between the actual total credit S and the maximum total credit, t = N s (N s 1) The range of t is <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. The value 1 corresponds to complete disagreement between the two rankings, and the value 1 indicates complete agreement. Testing the Significance of t The significance of Kendall's t can be tested under the null hypothesis H 0 that the two sets of ranks X and Y are unrelated.

Reference-contexts: attempt was made to measure texture similarities by using simple combinations of the six computational features, but the results did not correspond to the human data well. 4.2.2 Amadasun and King Amadasun and King proposed five computational features corresponding to textural properties of coarseness, contrast, busyness, complexity, and texture strength <ref> [2] </ref>. No strong reasons were given why these properties were chosen. The computational features were composed heuristically from the absolute differences between the gray scale value of each pixel and the averaged gray scale value in a neighborhood surrounding the pixel. <p> Firstly, more complex usage of multiple texture properties may be required. This observation is also made by both Tamura [87] and Amadasun <ref> [2] </ref>. Secondly, when more than two patterns are under consideration, the task for the computational model is not only determining whether the patterns are different, but also how different.

Reference-contexts: rigorous in that both the significance of the ranking correlations and the concordance of the human data are tested. 4.8.2 Early Vision Models and Texture Modeling Early Vision Models The vast majority of human texture perception research has been carried out in the context of texture discrimination and segregation (See <ref> [7] </ref> for a review). The early work includes the texton theory by Julesz et al. [46][47][48] and the physical attribute based approach of Beck [5][3][4]. More recently, computationally explicit early vision models have been proposed [6][9][10][16] [41][64][91].

Reference-contexts: Computationally, this perception model has been implemented as a set of oriented linear filters followed by some rectifying nonlinearity that computes the local energy of the filter output <ref> [10] </ref>. By this model, the spatial properties of texture patterns are encoded in the local energy distribution of the filter output. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the total energy associated with a particular textural property to represent the perceptual strength of that property. <p> The explanatory and predictive power of these perception models has been demonstrated in various texture discrimination and segregation tasks. An example is the texture segregation model by Bergen and Landy <ref> [10] </ref>. The initial stage of the model consists of a set of linear filters in different orientations and spatial scales. These filters are followed by a rectifying nonlinearity, which computes the energy of the filter output. <p> Relations to Wold-based Texture Modeling First and second directional derivatives have been used as the set of linear filters in early vision models [9]<ref> [10] </ref>. However, the choice of the filters is not critical [10]. To gain some insights into the relations between Wold-based modeling and early vision models, the use of Gabor filters is considered here. Gabor functions are essentially Gaussian functions modulated by complex sinusoids.

Reference-contexts: In practical situations, this is often the case. 6.6.2 Applications Among other possible applications, the proposed algorithm can be applied to motion classification and recognition. In <ref> [14] </ref>, the shape of the active region in a sequence was used for activity recognition. In [77], the sum of the flow magnitudes in tessellated frame areas of periodic motion were used as feature vectors for motion classification.

Reference-contexts: The most important advantage of Wold-based texture modeling lies with the third criterion. An independent psychophysical study has identified the top three perceptual dimensions of human texture perception as "repetitiveness", "directionality", and "granularity and complexity" [79]. As shown by the Brodatz texture <ref> [15] </ref> examples in Figure 1-1, the perceptual properties of the Wold components can be described as "periodicity", "directionality", and "randomness", agreeing closely with the findings of the human study. 1.5 Goal and Contributions The goal of this research is to establish Wold-based texture modeling as an important method for a wide <p> A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the Wold-based model is in Section 5.7, followed by several conclusions. 5.2 Brodatz Texture Database The "Brodatz texture database" contains 1008 natural texture patches, cropped from all 112 pictures in the Brodatz album <ref> [15] </ref>. Each Brodatz texture provides nine 128 fi 128 non-overlapping sub-images in 8-bit gray levels. This collection contains a large variety of natural textures, including the many inhomogeneous ones which are not usually included in texture studies.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the first 15 retrieved images are considered and 4 matches are found for an image, then the recognition rate for that image at retrieved set size 15 is 50%. The models evaluated include the MRSAR, the SPCA, the tree-structured wavelet transform (TWT) 1 <ref> [17] </ref>, and the three Tamura features of coarseness, contrast, and directionality [87] as used in [69]. Note that this evaluation method uses a traditional pattern recognition criterion, not necessarily agreeing with perceptual criteria. <p> However, in many retrieval cases where structured image patterns are 1 The TWT method is sensitive to image sizes. Much smaller than the 512 fi 512 used in <ref> [17] </ref>, the 128 fi 128 database image size had a negative impact on the TWT performance in the benchmarking. 5.3.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding spectral decomposition of the deterministic random field is as follows <ref> [26] </ref>. Theorem 8 Let F p (~; ) be the spectral distribution function of the half-plane deterministic component of a homogeneous regular random field fy (m; n)g and F g (~; ) be the spectral distribution function of the generalized evanescent component of fy (m; n)g. <p> homogeneous random field into deterministic and purely indeterministic components can be achieved by the spectral Lebesgue decomposition, which separates the singular and the absolutely continuous components of the spectral distribution of the field. 2.5 Approximations Certain approximations to the 2-D Wold-like decomposition theory can be made for practical applications. (See <ref> [26] </ref> for more details.) Since the spectral measure of the deterministic component of a homogeneous regular field is concentrated on a set with Lebesgue measure zero (Theorem 4), the derivative of the spectral distribution function of the deterministic component is zero almost everywhere in K. <p> One sufficient condition for the existence of an AR representation is that f w (~; ) is strictly positive on and analytic in some neighborhood of the unit bicircle [24][94]. In practice, this condition is usually satisfied and an AR representation of the purely indeterministic field can be found <ref> [26] </ref>. In the following, the harmonic, the evanescent, and the purely indeterministic components of a random field are referred to as the Wold components. Shown in the next section, the spatial patterns of these Wold components appear to be visually repetitive, directional, and random.

Reference-contexts: Picard discussed the parameter selection of this hybrid model and explored the use of an external field to introduce structure to a Gibbs random field [74]. More recently, Francos et al. proposed a unified texture model based on the 2-D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields <ref> [27] </ref>. Wold-based texture modeling (Wold-based modeling or Wold model for short) is the focus of this dissertation. 1.3 Criteria for Texture Models Different criteria can be applied when evaluating a texture model, often biased by the particular application in hand. Two of the most common considerations are: 1. <p> The main advantage of this method is that it provides parametric descriptions of all Wold components in a random field. The main disadvantage is its computational cost. The entire procedure involves a high-order prediction model fitting, ARMA fittings, and gradient-based search. 3.2.2 Periodogram Thresholding The decomposition procedure proposed in <ref> [27] </ref> uses image periodogram thresholding to identify large Fourier spectral values as the harmonic and the evanescent components. The initial threshold is set to be the maximal value of the periodogram. <p> There are essentially two issues in spectral Wold decomposition. One is to detect the spectral peaks; the other is to determine the peak support regions. The procedure in <ref> [27] </ref> resolves these two issues by using global thresholding of the periodogram values. However, there are cases in which this method fails. An example is shown in Figure 3-1.

Reference-contexts: Various choices of the "past", such as symmetric half-plane, non-symmetric half-plane (NSHP), quarter-plane, "vertical" and "horizontal" half-planes, etc., have been used and resulted in two-fold, three-fold and four-fold Wold-like decomposition of 2-D homogeneous random fields [18][19][42][43] [50][51][57]. It is shown by Francos et al. <ref> [28] </ref> that, by considering a countably infinite set of "total-order" and rational non-symmetric half-plane (RNSHP) support (see Section 2.2.1), a corresponding countably-infinite-fold Wold-like decomposition of 2-D homogeneous random field can be obtained and the two-fold, three-fold, and four-fold Wold-like decompositions are special cases of this countably-infinite-fold decomposition. <p> DECOMPOSITION OF HOMOGENEOUS RANDOM FIELDS 25 This leads to the following theorem <ref> [28] </ref>: Theorem 7 The deterministic component fv (m; n)g of a 2-D regular and homogeneous random field fy (m; n)g can be decomposed uniquely as v (m; n) = p (m; n) + g (m; n); (2.30) where field fp (m; n)g is half-plane deterministic and field fg (m; n)g is

Reference-contexts: Francos et al. also generalized the NSHP-based decomposition to the case of 2-D non-homogeneous random fields <ref> [31] </ref>. In the following, first the 2-D linear prediction problem is formulated. Then, the Wold-like decomposition of 2-D non-homogeneous random fields is presented, followed by the Wold-like decomposition of homogeneous random fields and the corresponding spectral decomposition. To apply 15 16 CHAPTER 2. <p> Denote the predictor as ^y S M;N (m; n), then ^y S M;N (m; n) = (k;l)2S M;N (m;n) (k; l) y (m k; n l): (2.7) 2.3.

A texture pattern is characterized either by statistics of image pixel gray scale values or by a stochastic model.

Reference-contexts: Texture models capable of representing both structure and randomness have been studied. Garand and Weinman proposed a hybrid model which uses structured low frequency Fourier information as the initial state for a Gibbs random field model to synthesize cloud textures <ref> [34] </ref>. Picard discussed the parameter selection of this hybrid model and explored the use of an external field to introduce structure to a Gibbs random field [74].

Reference-contexts: The variance of ^ P y (k; l) is often on the order of the true spectra P y (k; l), independent of the image size [59]. Typically, some type of smoothing technique is used in the estimation, as in the Bartlett estimator and Welch estimator <ref> [45] </ref>. However, in the spectral Wold decomposition, an image is decomposed via the inverse Fourier transform of its decomposed spectra. Hence, the spectral decomposition has to be based on the actual DFT values of the original image, so smoothing techniques can not be liberally applied.

Reference-contexts: Historically, texture models are categorized as statistical, structural, or statistical-structural (hybrid) [36][37][88][93].

Reference-contexts: Various AR implementations have been applied to texture modeling. In this work, the second-order symmetric MRSAR model of Mao and Jain [66] is used.

It has been shown that under the experimental circumstances similar to this work, the LSE and the ML estimates offer very similar performance [56].

The 2-D Levinson algorithm is especially useful when the model order determination is involved in the parameter estimation. Since the MRSAR modeling in this work targets the relatively unstructured patterns in an image, a fixed second-order model is chosen and the LSE estimation is used for its computational simplicity.

Reference-contexts: The benchmarking results show that, when compared to the other three, the MRSAR model offers the best intra-class recognition rate (see Figure 5-13 in Section 5.7.3). Recently, a Gabor wavelet decomposition model was also applied to image retrieval and its performance benchmarked against the MRSAR model <ref> [65] </ref>. By the recognition rate operating characteristics, the retrieval performance of the Gabor and MRSAR methods are similar. Therefore, by this criterion, it would be reasonable to regard MRSAR as representative of the state-of-the-art texture modeling for image database retrieval.

Then flow magnitudes in tessellated frame areas of periodic motion were used as feature vectors for motion classification. <p> In practical situations, this is often the case. 6.6.2 Applications Among other possible applications, the proposed algorithm can be applied to motion classification and recognition. In [14], the shape of the active region in a sequence was used for activity recognition. In <ref> [77] </ref>, the sum of the flow magnitudes in tessellated frame areas of periodic motion were used as feature vectors for motion classification.

Reference-contexts: The template generating procedure also provides a tool for detecting and segmenting regions of periodicity. The proposed method is Fourier spectral based and uses 1-D Fourier transforms; therefore, it is also computationally efficient. 6.2 The Approach The term temporal texture is defined in <ref> [78] </ref> as "motion patterns of indeterminate spatial and temporal extent". This definition emphasizes the randomness of a temporal event. In this work, "temporal texture" is used to refer to any approximately homogeneous spatiotemporal phenomenon. <p> The algorithm is not expected to segment out the walking person. Instead, regions of legs and arms and the outline of the bouncing head and shoulder should be identified. 6.3 Related Work The work of Polana and Nelson on periodic motion detection <ref> [78] </ref> is perhaps the most relevant to the approach presented in this chapter. In their work, reference curves, which are lines parallel to the trajectory of the motion flow centroid, are extracted and their power spectra computed. <p> The resulting harmonic energy ratios of the periodicity templates in Figure 6-14 show clearly that, unlike optical-flow based methods, the proposed algorithm is robust in the presence of noise. 6.6 Discussion 6.6.1 Algorithm Compared to the one used in <ref> [78] </ref>, the periodicity measure proposed here in the form of the temporal harmonic energy ratio is a more accurate and more reliable measure of signal periodicity.

Reference-contexts: The most important advantage of Wold-based texture modeling lies with the third criterion. An independent psychophysical study has identified the top three perceptual dimensions of human texture perception as "repetitiveness", "directionality", and "granularity and complexity" <ref> [79] </ref>. <p> while both studies used a large number of human subjects in the experiment, the concordance of the human data was not evaluated in any manner. 4.3 Experimental Design 4.3.1 Dimensions of Human Texture Perception Rao and Lohse conducted a human study to identify the relevant dimensions of human texture perception <ref> [79] </ref>. In their experiment, twenty test subjects first rated 56 pictures from the Brodatz album on twelve 9-point Likert scales labeled by adjectives such as repetitive, directional, random, granular, uniform, regular, etc.. Then, the subjects were asked to sort the pictures into groups of similar items. <p> IMAGE DATABASE RETRIEVAL 5.4 A Wold-based Texture Model 5.4.1 Model Construction Perceptually, by Rao and Lohse's study <ref> [79] </ref>, the existence of periodic structure is the strongest perceptual cue in texture discrimination. A careful examination of all Brodatz database images and their Fourier spectra reveals the following: * Natural textures often contain multiple Wold components.

Reference-contexts: Small clusters (less than 4000 pixels) are eliminated and their members re-assigned. Clusters are merged when their mutual Mahalanobis distance is small. The program terminates after a given number of iterations or when no pixel changes its cluster membership in an iteration. One morphological closing <ref> [80] </ref> operation is applied to the segmentation output to smooth the boundaries.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the orthogonal decomposition of a homogeneous random field into deterministic and purely indeterministic components can be achieved by performing a spectral Lebesgue decomposition <ref> [82] </ref>, which separates the singular and the absolutely continuous components of the spectral distribution of the random field. 2.4.3 Invariability As mentioned at the end of last section, the set of multiple total-order and RNSHP support O gives rise to a corresponding family of orthogonal decompositions of a random field since

Reference-contexts: Schucany and Frawley extended the concept of the L statistic introduced by Page [71] and proposed a rank test for two group concordance <ref> [83] </ref>. This test uses the L statistic, which is defined as the inner product of the two sets of rank sums of the two groups, to assess both the within-group and the between-group concordance.

Reference-contexts: However, the two coefficients have the same power in detecting the existence of association in the rankings. That is, the distributions of r s and t are such that, with a given set of data, both will reject the null hypothesis at the same level of significance <ref> [84] </ref>. 4.6.7 Concordance of All Human Data Overview In the above, the averaged human ranking scores are used to determine the final ranking of the test images. The final ranking scores are subsequently used to assess the correlation between the human and the computer ranking data.

Reference-contexts: The basic image representation provided by the initial stage is then used by a correlation based decision making mechanism to achieve texture segregation. More recently, a model of two-stage linear filtering and decision making has been proposed by Sutter et al. <ref> [86] </ref>. Relations to Wold-based Texture Modeling First and second directional derivatives have been used as the set of linear filters in early vision models [9][10]. However, the choice of the filters is not critical [10].

Reference-contexts: From the descriptions seen in the literature and from observations of the Brodatz textures, Tamura et al. chose six visual textural properties | coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness | to model as computational texture features <ref> [87] </ref>. 53 54 CHAPTER 4. PERCEPTUAL PROPERTIES Human experiments were conducted to establish the ground truth ordering of 16 Brodatz texture samples based on each of the six textural properties. <p> Firstly, more complex usage of multiple texture properties may be required. This observation is also made by both Tamura <ref> [87] </ref> and Amadasun [2]. Secondly, when more than two patterns are under consideration, the task for the computational model is not only determining whether the patterns are different, but also how different. <p> The models evaluated include the MRSAR, the SPCA, the tree-structured wavelet transform (TWT) 1 [17], and the three Tamura features of coarseness, contrast, and directionality <ref> [87] </ref> as used in [69]. Note that this evaluation method uses a traditional pattern recognition criterion, not necessarily agreeing with perceptual criteria. The benchmarking results show that, when compared to the other three, the MRSAR model offers the best intra-class recognition rate (see Figure 5-13 in Section 5.7.3).

Reference-contexts: However, as demonstrated in Figure 6-12, the noise sensitivity of the flow based method can be a drawback in real applications. The optical flow magnitudes are estimated here by using the hierarchical least-squares algorithm <ref> [92] </ref> which is based on a gradient approach described in [11][62]. This algorithm is representative of the existing optical flow estimation techniques.

Reference-contexts: The main deficiency of the structural methods is that they are incapable of capturing or generating the randomness that natural textures almost always possess. Statistical-structural Models Analogies have been made between the structural/statistical characterization of texture models and the attentive/pre-attentive dichotomy in low-level human vision <ref> [95] </ref>. However, this division of texture models is based on the functional properties of the models, and natural textures usually contain both structural and statistical components. Texture models capable of representing both structure and randomness have been studied.

Reference-contexts: The intent is to make a concise but comprehensive presentation of a theoretical framework to which many people have contributed over the years. References are given throughout the chapter for details and proofs. The original decomposition theory due to Wold applies to the analysis of one-dimensional stationary random processes <ref> [96] </ref>. It provides a general representation of such processes, as well as an interpretation of the representation in terms of linear prediction. To analyze the structure of a 2-D discrete random field, a two-dimensional linear prediction problem can be similarly formulated. <p> The one-dimensional signals along the temporal dimension of a three-dimensional data volume formed by an image sequence can be considered as stochastic processes. When assuming sta-tionarity, a stochastic signal can be decomposed into deterministic (periodic) and indeterministic (random) components. This is the classic 1-D Wold decomposition of stochastic processes <ref> [96] </ref>: 103 104 CHAPTER 6.
