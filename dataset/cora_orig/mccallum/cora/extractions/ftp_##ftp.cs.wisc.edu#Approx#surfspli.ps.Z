Abstract: The functions m := j j 2md if d is odd, and m := j j 2md log j j if d is even, are known as surface splines, and are commonly used in the interpolation or approximation of smooth functions. We show that if one's domain is the unit ball in R d , then the approximation order of the translates of m is at most m. This is in contrast to the case when the domain is all of R d where it is known that the approximation order is exactly 2m.

Reference-contexts: For the sake of the present discussion, we mention only that for the surface spline, m , it is known that interpolation from S ( m ; hZ d ; 0) 1 provides approximation of order 2m in = R d . Later, Buhmann, Dyn and Levin <ref> [2] </ref> were able to dismiss the assumption ffi = hZ d , while still retaining the assumption = R d (see also [5],[3]). By and large they obtained the same approximation orders as were obtained under the simplifying assumption ffi = hZ d .

Reference-contexts: The surface splines, m , arise naturally in the solution of a variational problem. Duchon <ref> [6] </ref> showed that of all functions which interpolate f j ffi , the one which minimizes a certain semi-norm is the one which belongs to S ( m ; ffi; m). The results of the present work apply primarily to this example.
