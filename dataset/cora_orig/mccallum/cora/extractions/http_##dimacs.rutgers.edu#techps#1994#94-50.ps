Reference-contexts: Given a pure Horn CNF find an equivalent CNF (i.e. a CNF representing the same function) which is minimum with respect to a certain criterium, e.g. which consists of a minimum number of clauses or a minimum number of literals. It was proven in [11] and <ref> [1] </ref> that this problem is NP-complete with respect to both of the above criteria. For this reason good minimization heuristics are sought. One simple heuristic makes use of the classes of equivalent proposition letters. Given a pure Horn CNF F the heuristic is : 1.

We also prove that this algorithm achieves the best possible worst case complexity. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the basic Boolean terminology.

Reference-contexts: A CNF F representing a function f is called prime iff each clause of F is a prime implicate of the function. For the cases of Horn and pure Horn functions, it is well-known (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>) that each prime implicate of a - 2 - (pure) Horn function is (pure) Horn. Thus, in particular, any prime CNF representing a pure Horn function is pure Horn. <p> the complexity of finding a minimum CNF of a given pure Horn function (recall that for every graph G the function f G is pure Horn), and since a prime CNF can be obtained from any pure Horn CNF representation of a pure Horn function in polynomial time (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>) without increasing the number of clauses, we may restrict our attention solely to prime implicates and prime CNFs of pure Horn functions without any loss of generality.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. The well-known Quine theorem (se e.g. <ref> [12, 13] </ref>) states that given an arbitrary CNF F representing a Boolean function f, every prime implicate of f can be derived from F by a chain (sequence) of consensuses. The theorem can be used in an algorithmic manner as follows. <p> In this section we shall show that for the class of pure Horn functions we can state a special form of the well-known Quine theorem (se e.g. <ref> [12, 13] </ref>) and that this form posseses some desirable properties. The Quine theorem claims that given a CNF F representing a (general) Boolean function f, any prime implicate of f can be derived from F by a chain (sequence) of consensuses.
