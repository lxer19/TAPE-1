Title: The Healthwise Knowledgebase  
Author: Craig Bryant, Qian Zhang 
Date: December 9, 1996  
Abstract: The Healthwise Knowledgebase is a computer based medical information system designed for medical personnel and the general public. It is part of the Healthwise Communities Project, a medical intervention project underway in Idaho. The goal of the project is to reduce medical care costs in the four counties surrounding Boise, Idaho by helping patients be more informed about their health care and work in partnership with their doctors in managing their health care. Since the system's target users may have no much computer and medicine background, it is an open question that if the system is easy for use and how we can improve the system to make it more helpful. A thorough usability evalution should be performed to answer this question. Our evaluation work gives an overall system critique, designs the heuristic evaluation and user testing plan, summarizes the current evaluation results, and proposes some recommended improvements. Although the system is a complete and helpful system with a generally acceptable user interface for its target users, there is much work to do to improve its user interface and some system features.

The goal of the project is to reduce medical care costs in the four counties surrounding Boise by helping patients be more informed about their health care, and work in partnership with their doctors in managing their health care. <p> The Healthwise Partnership Program Focusing on helping doctors, nurses, and other health care providers support the new "empowered" health consumers. The Healthwise Knowledgebase <ref> [Inc96] </ref>, a computer based medical information system, is used by Healthwise Line nurses and is installed in some of the Healthwise Information Stations along with a selection of medical reference texts.

Reference-contexts: A thorough usability evalution should be performed to answer this question. Both project members and one invited user interface designer evaluated the user interface of the system by doing heuristic evaluation <ref> [MN95] </ref> based on Human Computer Interaction technology and some user interface design guidelines. In addition, we designed some user testing senarios and carefully selected a couple of user testing subjects to work through them. <p> Section 2 introduces the Healthwise Communities Project and describes the Healthwise Knowledgebase system. Section 3 provides an overall critique of the system, using usability guidelines developed by J. Nielsen <ref> [MN95] </ref> for heuristic evaluation. Section 4 describes our prototype evaluation and some suggestions for the future work. Section 5 summarizes the evaluation results. In Section 6 we proposes some recommended improvements to solve the current system problems. Section 7 concludes the report. <p> We were primarily concerned with ease of access to the considerable information content in the system. This section will provide an overall critique of the system, using usability guidelines developed by J. Nielsen in a chapter on Heuristic Evaluation from "Usability Inspection Methods" <ref> [MN95] </ref>. This section does not comprise our entire critique. For more details, see Section 5, Evaluation Results. 3.1 Visibility of System Status Visibility of System Status means that the system should keep the user informed about what is going on at all times. <p> The UI designer evaluated the system based on the User Interface Design Guidelines in use at Tektronix. Both project members investigated the system based on the ten usability guidelines developed by J. Nielsen <ref> [MN95] </ref> and what we have learned from the class. 4.1.2 Suggestions In our prototype evaluation, the invited UI designer did not spend much time to play with the system.
