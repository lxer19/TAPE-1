Abstract: Recent results on the internal, measure-theoretic structure of the exponential time complexity classes E = DTIME(2 linear ) and E 2 = DTIME(2 polynomial ) are surveyed. The measure structure of these classes is seen to interact in informative ways with bi-immunity, complexity cores, P

Reference-contexts: This is not surprising, once it is noted that our proof of Corollary 12.6 is an application of (a resource-bounded generalization of) the probabilistic method <ref> [15, 61, 62, 16, 63, 1] </ref>, which exploits the fact that it is often easier to establish the abundance of objects of a given type than to construct a specific object of that type.

Reference-contexts: If NP does not have p-measure 0, then E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE. Corollary 13.6 (Lutz and Mayordomo [40]). If NP does not have p-measure 0, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision problem. Proof. Bellare and Goldwasser <ref> [5] </ref> have shown that, if EE 6= NEE, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision prob lem. The present corollary follows immediately from this and Theorem 13.5. 2 We now consider complexity cores of languages that are P m -hard for NP.

Reference-contexts: Then (C E j E) = (C E 2 j E 2 ) = 0. Mayordomo's original proof of this result used Theorem 4.5 and Berman's result <ref> [6] </ref> that no P m -complete language for E or E 2 is P-immune. We now see that Mayordomo's result also follows from Theorem 6.3 and from Theorem 7.1. 8 Upper bounds for hard problems We saw in Theorem 6.3 that P m -hard languages for E are very rare.

Reference-contexts: There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP. The CvKL Conjecture is very ambitious, since it implies that P 6= NP. The question has thus been raised <ref> [31, 60, 23, 10] </ref> whether the CvKL Conjecture can be derived from some reasonable complexity-theoretic hypothesis, such as P 6= NP or the separation of the polynomial-time hierarchy into infinitely many levels.

Reference-contexts: This result, which appears to be very useful, is explained in this section. Properties defined in terms of limiting frequencies of failure of prediction schemes are called stochas-ticity properties in the terminology of Kolmogorov [30, 65]. (Such properties were originally proposed by von Mises [66] and Church <ref> [11] </ref> in their efforts to define randomness.) Because the prediction schemes allowed in this section are of a restricted sort, the property discussed here is a weak stochasticity property. We now make our terminology precise. Our notion of advice classes is standard [28].

Reference-contexts: The last result that we mention in this section concerns NP-completeness. The NP-completeness of decision problems has two principal, well-known formulations. These are the P T -completeness introduced by Cook <ref> [12] </ref> and the P m -completeness introduced by Karp [27] and Levin [32]. It is widely conjectured ([31, 72, 33, 23]) that these two notions are distinct: CvKL Conjecture. ("Cook versus Karp-Levin"). There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP.

Reference-contexts: These structures have many interacting facets, including a variety of reducibil-ities [31], complete languages under these re ducibilities [64, 68], measure structure [35], and category structure <ref> [34, 18] </ref>. (ii) E 2 is the smallest deterministic time complexity class known to contain NP. It also contains PSPACE, and hence the polynomial-time hierarchy and many other classes of interest in complexity theory. <p> Mayordomo [44] has shown that, in contrast with Theorem 4.5, the set of P-bi-immune languages is neither meager nor comeager in E. Fenner <ref> [18] </ref> has technically refined the resource-bounded category of [34] and proven that the set of oracles sep arating P from NP is comeager in E 2 . <p> For example, a language A is p-random if it is not in any p-measure 0 set, and p-generic if it is not in any p-meager set. The set of p-random languages has measure 1 in E 2 [36] and the set of p-generic languages is comeager in E 2 <ref> [18] </ref>. The analogous pspace-random languages have been investigated by Lutz and Schmidt [35, 38, 41], and p-generic languages have been investigated by Fenner [18], but p-randomness and p-genericity require much more investigation.

Resource-bounded measure is a powerful generalization of Lebesgue measure. There is reason to hope that it will be as fruitful in complexity theory as Lebesgue measure has been in analysis and mathematical physics.

Reference-contexts: Suppose that a language A f0; 1g fl is chosen by a random experiment in which an independent toss of a fair coin is used to decide whether each string is in A. Then classical Lebesgue measure theory (described in <ref> [21, 52] </ref>, for example) identifies certain measurable sets of languages (also called events) and assigns to each measurable set X a measure (X), which is the probability that A 2 X in this experiment.

Reference-contexts: E is a proper subset of E 2 , but it contains P and "the essential part of NP" [68], i.e., many NP-complete problems. (iii) E and E 2 have been proven to contain intractable problems <ref> [22] </ref>. From the standpoint of complexity theory, this existence of intractability is a valuable resource. This is because, in practice, a proof that a specific language A is intractable proceeds by inferring the intractability of A from the intractability of some language B chosen or con structed for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: Meyer [46] proved that E contains languages that are incompressible by P m -reductions. The following result shows that almost every language in E has this property. Theorem 4.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). <p> Since fi fi b d r (w) d (w) fi fi = i=r+jwj+1 i=r+jwj+1 2 jwji = 2 r for all r 2 N and w 2 f0; 1g fl , it follows that d is p-computable. 2 Corollary 4.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). Almost every language in E and almost every language in E 2 is incompressible by P m -reductions. Corollary 4.3 (Meyer [46]). There is a language A 2 E that is incompressible by P m -reductions. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of P-bi-immunity. Definition. <p> The following observation, an obvious generaliza tion of a result of Balcazar and Schoning [4] (see Corollary 5.2 below), relates incompressibility to complexity cores. Lemma 5.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). If t : N ! N is time constructible then every language that is incompressible by DTIME (t) m -reductions has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (t)-complexity core. Corollary 5.2. <p> Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 5.2 now tell us that almost every language decidable in exponential time has complexity cores of the largest possible size.

Theorem 6.3 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). Let H E be the set of all languages that are P m -hard for E. Then p (H E ) = 0. Proof. Let A be as in Corollary 4.3. <p> The P m degree of a language A f0; 1g fl is the set deg P 1 (A): Theorem 7.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). For all A f0; 1g fl , m (A) j E) = (deg P Proof. We prove that (deg P m (A) j E) = 0. <p> The following result states that every P m -hard language for E can be decided in time 2 4n on a dense set of instances that can itself be decided in time 2 4n . Theorem 8.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). For every P m -hard language H for E, there exist B; D 2 DTIME (2 4n ) such that D is dense and B = H " D. <p> It is straightforward to use Theorem 8.1 to prove that P m -hard languages for E obey the following up per bound on the sizes of complexity cores. Theorem 8.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). Every DTIME (2 4n )-complexity core of every P m -hard language for E has a dense complement. By Corollary 5.3, almost every language in E has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (2 4n )-complexity core. <p> Although " P m -hard for E" and " P m -hard for E 2 " are equivalent, we do not know the relationship between "weakly P m -hard for E" and "weakly P m -hard for E 2 ." Theorem 9.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). Every language that is weakly P m -hard for E or E 2 has a dense exponential complexity core. 10 Nonuniform complexity Much remains to be discovered about the nonuniform complexities of languages in E and E 2 . <p> Theorem 13.7 (Orponen and Schoning [51]). If P 6= NP, then every language that is P m -hard for NP has a nonsparse P-complexity core. Strengthening the hypothesis of Theorem 13.7 gives a stronger conclusion. (This essentially follows from Theorem 9.2.) Theorem 13.8 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [26] </ref>). If NP does not have p-measure 0, then every language that is P m - hard for NP has a dense exponential complexity core. Concerning the density of hard languages for NP, Theorem 12.5 gives us the following result.

Intuitively, a language that is P-bi-immune "cannot be nontrivially approximated, from inside or outside," by any language in P. Proposition 4.4 (Ko and Moore <ref> [29] </ref>). Every language that is incompressible by P m -reductions is P bi-immune. In light of this proposition, languages that are incompressible by P m -reductions are sometimes called "strongly P-bi-immune" [4, 3]. The following result shows that almost every language in E is P-bi-immune. Theorem 4.5 (Mayordomo [44]).

Reference-contexts: This result, which appears to be very useful, is explained in this section. Properties defined in terms of limiting frequencies of failure of prediction schemes are called stochas-ticity properties in the terminology of Kolmogorov <ref> [30, 65] </ref>. (Such properties were originally proposed by von Mises [66] and Church [11] in their efforts to define randomness.) Because the prediction schemes allowed in this section are of a restricted sort, the property discussed here is a weak stochasticity property. We now make our terminology precise.

Reference-contexts: There are three reasons for our interest in the com plexity classes E and E 2 . (i) E and E 2 have rich, apparently well-behaved, internal structures. These structures have many interacting facets, including a variety of reducibil-ities <ref> [31] </ref>, complete languages under these re ducibilities [64, 68], measure structure [35], and category structure [34, 18]. (ii) E 2 is the smallest deterministic time complexity class known to contain NP. It also contains PSPACE, and hence the polynomial-time hierarchy and many other classes of interest in complexity theory. <p> There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP. The CvKL Conjecture is very ambitious, since it implies that P 6= NP. The question has thus been raised <ref> [31, 60, 23, 10] </ref> whether the CvKL Conjecture can be derived from some reasonable complexity-theoretic hypothesis, such as P 6= NP or the separation of the polynomial-time hierarchy into infinitely many levels.

Reference-contexts: The last result that we mention in this section concerns NP-completeness. The NP-completeness of decision problems has two principal, well-known formulations. These are the P T -completeness introduced by Cook [12] and the P m -completeness introduced by Karp [27] and Levin <ref> [32] </ref>. It is widely conjectured ([31, 72, 33, 23]) that these two notions are distinct: CvKL Conjecture. ("Cook versus Karp-Levin"). There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP. The CvKL Conjecture is very ambitious, since it implies that P 6= NP.

The following result is well-known. Theorem 13.7 (Orponen and Schoning <ref> [51] </ref>). If P 6= NP, then every language that is P m -hard for NP has a nonsparse P-complexity core. Strengthening the hypothesis of Theorem 13.7 gives a stronger conclusion. (This essentially follows from Theorem 9.2.) Theorem 13.8 (Juedes and Lutz [26]).

Reference-contexts: Suppose that a language A f0; 1g fl is chosen by a random experiment in which an independent toss of a fair coin is used to decide whether each string is in A. Then classical Lebesgue measure theory (described in <ref> [21, 52] </ref>, for example) identifies certain measurable sets of languages (also called events) and assigns to each measurable set X a measure (X), which is the probability that A 2 X in this experiment. <p> 6 P/Poly? Does p (NP) 6= 0 imply that there is a language that is P T -complete, but not P tt -complete, for NP? Do these hypotheses have unreasonable conse quences? Many significant questions remain. (vii) The classical notion of Baire category is a topological analogue of Lebesgue measure <ref> [52] </ref>. Resource-bounded Baire category, developed by Lutz [34], is a generalization of Baire category that reveals internal Baire category structure in E, E 2 , and other complexity classes. Roughly speaking, "meager" and "comeager" are to resource-bounded category as "measure 0" and "measure 1" are to resource-bounded measure, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Although Theorem 4.5 follows immediately from Corollary 4.2 and Proposition 4.4, it should be noted that Mayordomo's proof of this result preceded, and was independent of, the proofs of Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.2. 5 Complexity cores Complexity cores, first introduced by Lynch [42] have been studied extensively <ref> [13, 17, 50, 51, 8, 25, 53, 9, 14, 71, etc.] </ref>. Intuitively, a complexity core of a language A is a fixed set K of inputs such that every machine whose decisions are consistent with A fails to decide efficiently on all but finitely many elements of K.

Reference-contexts: The Baire category structure of E and E 2 is in some ways very similar to the measure theoretic structure, but is in other ways very different. Extending a result of Schoning <ref> [58] </ref> and Huynh [24], Lutz [34] shows that, if A s any language such that P m (A) is not meager in E (i.e., if A is "weakly P m -hard for E in the sense of Baire category"), then there is some " &gt; 0 such that j (A 4

Reference-contexts: Until recently, the issues addressed by structural complexity theory have been largely qualitative rather than quantitative. (Indeed, the introduction to <ref> [59] </ref> offered "qualitative" as a synonym for "structural.") This seemed to be an inevitable aspect of the subject. A problem is, or is not, complete for a complexity class. One complexity class is, or is not, contained in another.

Reference-contexts: There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP. The CvKL Conjecture is very ambitious, since it implies that P 6= NP. The question has thus been raised <ref> [31, 60, 23, 10] </ref> whether the CvKL Conjecture can be derived from some reasonable complexity-theoretic hypothesis, such as P 6= NP or the separation of the polynomial-time hierarchy into infinitely many levels.

Reference-contexts: There are three reasons for our interest in the com plexity classes E and E 2 . (i) E and E 2 have rich, apparently well-behaved, internal structures.

(ii) E 2 is the smallest deterministic time complexity class known to contain NP. It also contains PSPACE, and hence the polynomial-time hierarchy and many other classes of interest in complexity theory.
