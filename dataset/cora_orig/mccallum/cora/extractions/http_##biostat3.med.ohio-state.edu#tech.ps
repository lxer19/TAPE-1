Abstract: We suggest a one dimensional jump detection algorithm based on local polynomial fitting for jumps in regression functions (zero-order jumps) or jumps in derivatives (first-order or higher-order jumps). If jumps exist in the m-th order derivative of the underlying regression function, then an (m + 1) order polynomial is fitted in a neighborhood of each design point. We then characterize the jump information in the coefficients of the highest order terms of the fitted polynomials and suggest an algorithm for jump detection. This method is introduced briefly for the general set-up and then presented in detail for zero-order and first-order jumps. Several simulation examples are discussed. We apply this method to the Bombay (India) sea-level pressure data.
