Abstract: Specialization in populations of artificial neural networks is studied. Organisms with both fixed and evolvable fitness formulae are placed in isolated and shared environments, and the emerged behaviors are compared. An evolvable fitness formula specifies, that the evaluation measure is let free to evolve, and we obtain co-evolution of the expressed behavior and the individual evolvable fitness formula. In an isolated environment a generalist behavior emerges when organisms have a fixed fitness formula, and a specialist behavior emerges when organisms have individual evolvable fitness formulae. A population diversification analysis shows, that almost all organisms in a population in an isolated environment converge towards the same behavioral strategy, while we find, that competition can act to provide population diversification in populations of organisms in a shared environment.

Reference-contexts: The main difference from the environment in the first simulation is the direct competition among the organisms. We call this type of environment in which organisms live together a shared environment . We simulate natural evolution by the use of a genetic algorithm [4] <ref> [2] </ref>, that will search on the individual neural network connection weights. The population is constructed of 100 organisms, and we do truncation selection of the best 20%, i.e. the 20 best organisms are selected to do agamic (non-sexual) reproduction with mutations on 10% of the connection weights.

Reference-contexts: With an evolvable fitness formula the system is allowed to change the fitness landscape in order to cope with the changed environment. With changes in the environment on the evolutionary time scale, it has been found <ref> [8] </ref>, that populations of artificial neural networks with evolvable fitness formulae show pre-adaptations to environments different from those in which they evolved.

Reference-contexts: The real environment changes every moment, and e.g. biological organisms energy extracting abilities, upon which their fitness is based, changes too, either on the short term, during their life, or on the long term, evolutionarily over generations. As argued by Lund and Parisi <ref> [9] </ref>, the fitness formula, on which the selection is based, should therefore be let free to evolve as any other trait of the organisms without any necessary control from the researcher.

Reference-contexts: In an isolated environment an ecological neural network, as the ones used in the present simulations, will have the possiblity to self-select its' sensory inputs <ref> [10] </ref>. This was indeed the case in the first type of simulations where the organisms lived in an isolated environment. It was most evident in the simulation with organisms with evolvable fitness formulae.
