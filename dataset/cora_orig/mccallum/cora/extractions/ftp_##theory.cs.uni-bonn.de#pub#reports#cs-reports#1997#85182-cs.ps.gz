Abstract: The bandwidth problem is the problem of enumerating the vertices of a given graph G such that the maximum difference between the numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal. The problem has a long history and a number of applications. There was not much known though on approximation hardness of this problem, till recently. Karpinski and Wirtgen [KW 97] showed that there are no polynomial time approximation algorithms with an absolute error guarantee of n 1* for any * &gt; 0 unless P = N P . In this paper we show, that there is no P T AS for the bandwidth problem unless P = N P , even for trees. More precisely we show that there are no polynomial time approximation algorithms for general graphs with an approximation ratio better than 1:5, and for the trees with an approximation ratio better than 4=3 1:332.

Reference-contexts: Such meta-algorithms are called polynomial time approximation schemes (P T ASs), cf.eg., [Ho 97]. For the dense instances of M AX-SN P problems [PY 91], the existence of P T AS has been proven by Arora, Karger and Karpinski <ref> [AKK 95] </ref>. Most of the above algorithms have one thing in common, namely their running times are bounded by n O (f (1=*)) where the approximation ratio is r = 1 + *.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The bandwidth problem on graphs has a very long and interesting history cf. <ref> [CCDG 82] </ref>. Formally the bandwidth minimization problem is defined as follows. Let G = (V; E) be a simple graph on n vertices. A numbering ( or layout ) of G is a one-to-one mapping f : V ! f1; :::; ng.

Reference-contexts: The problem of constructing the bandwidth of a graph is N P -hard [Pa 76], even for trees with maximum degree 3 [GGJK 78]. There are only few cases for which we can construct the optimal layout in polynomial time [GGJK 78], [Sa 80], <ref> [Ch 88] </ref>, [Sm 95]. To date there was not much known about approximating the bandwidth. Recently Feige [Fe 97] constructed an approximation algorithm constructing a layout within a polylogarithmic factor of the optimum.

Reference-contexts: For this special class of trees the bandwidth problem was also shown to be N P -hard [Mo 86]. Karpinski, Wirtgen and Zelikovsky <ref> [KWZ 97] </ref> constructed a 3-approximation algorithm for ffi-dense graphs. A graph G is ffi-dense, if the minimum degree ffi (G) is at least ffin. We call it everywhere dense, if it is ffi-dense for some ffi &gt; 0. <p> It then becomes somewhat more complicated to describe how many stars and nodes are at the different positions. 3 Open problems An important computational problem still remains open about the existence of a P T AS for the bandwidth problem on dense graphs (cf. <ref> [KWZ 97] </ref>). Another important question is to improve both upper and lower approximation bounds on the general bandwidth problem, closing a large gap between O (1) and log O (1) n (cf. [Fe 97]).
