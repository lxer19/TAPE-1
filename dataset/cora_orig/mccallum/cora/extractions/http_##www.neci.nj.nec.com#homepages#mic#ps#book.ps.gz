Reference-contexts: The basic idea of evaluating move alternatives and using minimax search to guide the opening book play was presented independently in [Delteil (1993)] and <ref> [Buro (1994)] </ref>. Today, several good Othello programs, including HANNIBAL 1 by Martin Piotte and Louis Geof-froy, ECLIPSE by Colin Springer and Michael Giles, and Mark Brockington's KEYANO 2 , use variants of this technique.

Reference-contexts: Since the new technique finds promising move alternatives globally with respect to all variations stored in the opening book, it goes beyond the usual procedures that simply choose random moves from the book, or use stored deep evaluations of previously encountered positions in subsequent game-tree searches <ref> [Samuel (1959), Scherzer et al.
