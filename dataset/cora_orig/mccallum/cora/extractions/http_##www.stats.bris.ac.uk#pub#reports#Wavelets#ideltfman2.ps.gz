Title: Impact during equine locomotion: Techniques for measurement and analysis  
Author: J. F. Burn A. M. Wilson G. P. Nason

Abstract: Impact is implicated in the development of several types of musculoskeletal injury in the horse. Characterisation of impact experienced during strenuous exercise is an important first step towards understanding the mechanism for injury. Measurement and analysis of large, short duration impacts is difficult. The measurement system must be able to record transient peaks and high frequencies accurately. The analysis technique must be able to characterise the impact signal in time and frequency. This paper presents a measurement system and analysis technique for the characterisation of large impacts. A piezoelectric accelerometer was securely mounted on the dorsal surface of the horses hoof. Saddle mounted charge amplifiers and a 20 metre coaxial cable transferred these data to a PC based logging system. Data were downloaded onto a UNIX workstation and analysed using a proprietary statistics package. The values of parameters calculated from the time series data were comparable to those of other authors. A wavelet decomposition showed that the frequency profile of the signal changed with time. While most spectral energy was seen at impact, a significant amount of energy was contained in the signal immediately following impact. Over 99% of this energy was contained in frequencies less than 1,250Hz. The sampling rate and the frequency response of a measurement system for recording impact should be chosen carefully to prevent loss or corruption of data. Time scale analysis using a wavelet decomposition is a powerful technique which can be used to characterise impact data. The use of contour plots provides a highly visual representation of the time and frequency local isation of power during impact.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that an increase in the hardness of the foot/ground interface results in an increase in the magnitude and a decrease in duration of the initial peak, and an increase in the frequency of vibrations <ref> (Barrey et al. 1991, Benoit et al. 1993) </ref>. The difficulty of measurement and characterisation of impact is increased under conditions which produce complex time histories containing large magnitude transient peaks and high frequency vibrations. <p> The frequency components contained in complex time histories are difficult to interpret in the time domain. Measures of predominant (mean) frequency or central (median) frequency have been successfully used to differentiate between types of ground surface <ref> (Barrey et al. 1991) </ref> although they are insensitive to changes in amplitude and distribution of frequencies. Recent development of the discrete wavelet transform has provided a powerful method for spectral analysis of complex time series data (Nason and Silverman 1994). <p> 2 0 Time (ms) Resolution level 0 100 200 300 400 500 4 8 2000 2000 2000 2000 4000 4000 4000 6000 60006000 6000 6000 6000 8000 8000 8000 8000 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 12000 12000 14000 14000 16000 18000 20000 22000 6 ous studies of impact in horses <ref> (Barrey et al. 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These parameters are defined in Barrey et al. 1991. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was performed on the time series data for each impact using a wavelet from the family of least asymmetric compactly supported wavelets <ref> (Daubechies 1988) </ref>. A power spectrum was computed from the wavelet coefficients using the Wavethresh library (Nason and Silverman 1994) and plotted for each impact. Time is represented on the x axis of the power spectrum plot, and frequency, grouped into bands, is represented on the y axis.
