Abstract: We consider Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data in a signal detection framework. Our data set consists of responses evoked by the voiced syllables /b/ and /d/ and the corresponding voiceless syllables /p/ and /t/. The data yield well to principal component analysis (PCA), with a reasonable subspace in the order of three components out of 37 channels. To discriminate between responses to the voiced and voiceless versions of a consonant we form a feature vector by either matched filtering or wavelet packet decomposition and use a mixture-of-experts model to classify the stimuli. Both choices of a feature vector lead to a significant detection accuracy. Furthermore, we show how to estimate the onset time of a stimulus from a continuous data stream.

Reference-contexts: Although multi-sensor MEG systems recording magnetic flux at kilohertz sampling rates provide an incredibly rich source of data about brain activity, most current analysis techniques make use of only a fraction of the data collected <ref> (see, e.g., Aulanko et al. 1993, Fujimaki et al. 1995) </ref>. The most common approach to the analysis of stimulus evoked responses with MEG is to record 100 or more time-locked responses to the same stimulus, average these responses, and then perform single dipole source analysis on the averaged waves.

Reference-contexts: However, in practice the data set is large and performing the computation only on the largest principal components improves the efficiency markedly. 3.3 WAVELET PACKETS The windowed training signals are expanded in an orthonormal wavelet packet basis that assigns coefficients in a time-frequency grid <ref> (see e.g. Coifman and Saito 1994) </ref>. The transform is based on the repeated application of a quadrature mirror filter (Daubechies 6 was used in this work) followed by a downsampling step so that at each transform level the coefficients represent the time domain behavior of a particular frequency band.

Reference-contexts: The sampling rate was 1041.7 Hz with a bandwidth of 400 Hz. 3 ALGORITHMS Our analysis of the MEG data proceeds in three steps. In the first we reduce the dimensionality of the data from 37 to the order of three by principal component analysis (PCA) <ref> (see Oja 1983) </ref>. The second step is concerned with analyzing the reduced data in a time-dependent way with either matched filtering or wavelet packet analysis. <p> The effect of noise on many algorithms is also reduced as the signal is concentrated to the first channels. The transformation is defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data <ref> (see Oja 1983) </ref>. With the MEG data, we can define the covariance matrix either by the usual covariance over single epochs or by the covariance of the averaged responses to the stimuli.
