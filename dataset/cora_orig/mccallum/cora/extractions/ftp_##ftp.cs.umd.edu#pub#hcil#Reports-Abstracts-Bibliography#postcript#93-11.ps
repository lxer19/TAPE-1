Title: 219 5.4 User interface consistency: an evaluation of original and revised interfaces for a videodisk library  
Author: Richard Chimera Ben Shneiderman 
Note: B. Shneiderman, Ed., Ablex Publ., Norwood, NJ (1993)  
Abstract: Original and revised versions of the National Library of Medicine MicroAnatomy Visual Library system were evaluated with an empirical test of nineteen subjects. The versions of the programs interface differed on issues relating to consistency of wording and screen layout, use of color coding, display of status information, and availability of help information. Each subject used both versions of the program to perform matched sets of tasks. The dependent variables were time to perform tasks correctly and subjective satisfaction as reported via the QUIS questionnaire. The revised version was statistically significantly faster for five of twenty tasks and more satisfying to use on a number of dimensions. The benefits of consistency and guidelines for design of interactive computer systems are discussed. Sparks of Innovation in Human-Computer Interaction,

Reference-contexts: There were eleven major tasks, some had multiple parts, for a total of twenty-two tasks. When subjects finished all tasks with each version of the interface, they filled out the Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction <ref> (Chin, Diehl & Norman, 88) </ref>. Participants Nineteen University of Maryland staff and students were the participants. Eleven were male and eight were female. Approximately fifteen were students and four were staff. There were no qualification requirements imposed on the subjects for participating in the experiment.

Reference-contexts: Initial informal references to consistency have turned into ambitious attempts at formal definitions that get more elusive as they are scrutinized (Reisner 90; Wiecha et al. 90). Kellogg <ref> (Kellogg 89) </ref> points out that Consistency has no meaning on its own; it is inherently a relational concept. Therefore to merely say that an interface is consistent or that consistency is a goal of user interface design is also meaningless.
