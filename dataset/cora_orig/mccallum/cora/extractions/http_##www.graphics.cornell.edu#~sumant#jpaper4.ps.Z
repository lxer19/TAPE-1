Abstract: An equation adjoint to the luminance equation for describing the global illumination can be formulated using the notion of a surface potential to illuminate the region of interest. This adjoint equation which we shall call as the potential equation, is fundamental to the adjoint radiosity equation used to devise the importance driven radiosity algorithm. In this paper we first briefly derive the adjoint system of integral equations and then show that the adjoint linear equations used in the above algorithm are basically discrete formulations of the same. We also show that the importance entity of the linear equations is basically the potential function integrated over a patch. Further we prove that the linear operators in the two equations are indeed transposes of each other.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In a recent paper <ref> [1] </ref> Smits et al present a new importance driven radiosity algorithm for efficiently computing global illumination solutions with respect to a constrained set of views. The basis of this new algorithm is a pair of adjoint light transport equations. <p> These biasing functions ensure that more and more particles are directed towards those parts of the environment which are of greater interest and need more accurate illumination computation. Similarly in <ref> [1] </ref> the importance of patches is used to increase the efficiency of the hierarchic radiosity algorithm [9] by subdividing patches depending on their importance. So far the application of the adjoint equations has been restricted to global illumination computations in diffuse environments.

Reference-contexts: The basis of this new algorithm is a pair of adjoint light transport equations. One of these is the standard radiosity equation <ref> [2] </ref> which uses the form-factor matrix to relate the radiosity of any surface patch to the emitting sources in the environment. The other is the adjoint equation, which uses the transpose of the form-factor matrix to relate so called importance to the receivers. <p> Discrete Equations for a Diffuse Environment Because of their inherently complex nature it is difficult to solve Equations 1 and 2. However, simplified forms of these have been made amenable to analytical solutions. A simplified discrete formulation of the Equation 2, widely known as radiosity equation <ref> [2] </ref> , is i = E i + k i j=1 where i is the radiosity, i.e. flux per unit area, E i is the emission flux density, k i is the hemispherical diffuse reflectance of patch i and F ij is the form factor between patch i and patch j.

Reference-contexts: Importance and receivers are deemed as the duals of radiosity and emitting sources respectively. Smits et al visualise importance to be flowing out from the eye or camera and distributing itself amongst the patches of the environment, very much like light. In our earlier work <ref> [3] </ref> we have similarly formulated a pair of integral equations as an adjoint set for describing the light transport. <p> In order to make the contents of this paper self-contained we briefly derive the adjoint equations below. For a detailed discussion on the subject the reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> . 2. Potential Equation Because of the optical properties of surfaces, such as reflection, transmission, etc the light emitted from any surface in any direction can illuminate many other surfaces of an environment. <p> Concluding Remarks The primary use of the adjoint equations has been to increase computational efficiency. In the area of neutron transport [6] adjoint equations have been used for the estimation of flux and to provide a good choice for importance function biasing. In <ref> [3] </ref> we have presented algorithms for efficiently computing the global illumination in the Monte Carlo simulation of the particle model of light.

Reference-contexts: In our earlier work [3] we have similarly formulated a pair of integral equations as an adjoint set for describing the light transport. The first of these equations is basically Kajiya's rendering equation <ref> [4] </ref> defined in terms of luminance, emittance and brdfs, while the second is its adjoint defined in terms of potential, hypothetical detector (s) and brdfs. The potential equation is fundamental to the adjoint radiosity equation just as as much as the rendering equation is to the standard radiosity equation.
