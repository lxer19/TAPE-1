Abstract: This paper presents ongoing results of a contract between US Army CECOM and the University of Delaware to develop a formal specification of the datalink layer of MIL-STD-188-220A using the ISO International Standard Formal Description Technique Estelle (ISO 9074). The Estelle specification aims at discovering and resolving ambiguities in the original English document that would cause interpretation problems for implementors. The proposed architecture closely models ISO 8802's Logical Link Control for local area networks [7]. The paper also presents the state tables and transitions which constitute the modules of this architecture. At MILCOM 95, we reported on our initial effort to specify an earlier version titled 188-220 (version 7 May 1993) with support from the Army Research Laboratory in Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD [6]. Several updates have been generated since then as a result of regular meetings of the Combat Net Radio (CNR) Implementation Working Group (WG), previously known as the MIL-STD-188-220 WG. Our current specification efforts are based on the most recent version dated 27 Jul 1995. Thus far, over 30 ambiguities or inconsistencies (some minor, some major) have been discovered and reported to the CNR working group for incorporation into the developing 188-220A standard.

It is a key component of the Army Technical Architecture (ATA) for the digitized battlefield, and will likely become so in the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA). There are several synergistic efforts to assure that the standard is complete, correct, unambiguous, and performing suitably well.
