Reference-contexts: In the third section we characterize R (M) algebraically, using a certain Abelian group associated to M, called its "inner Tutte group." This group, denoted by T (0) was defined in <ref> [2] </ref> as the kernel of a certain homomorphism from a larger Abelian group, called the "Tutte group" of the matroid M, to a free Abelian group. For the Tutte group several presentations in terms of generators and relations were proposed in [2], but no such presentation was known for T (0) <p> This group, denoted by T (0) was defined in <ref> [2] </ref> as the kernel of a certain homomorphism from a larger Abelian group, called the "Tutte group" of the matroid M, to a free Abelian group.

Presentations of the inner Tutte group of a matroid by generators and relations Theorem 1, and especially its proof, are naturally connected with the theory of Tutte groups of matroids, developed in <ref> [2] </ref> and subsequent papers by the same authors. We recall now some definitions and theorems from this theory in a slightly modified form. The main difference is that we use circuits instead of hyperplanes (complements of cocircuits). Thus everything we state here is dual to the results of [2] etc. <p> developed in <ref> [2] </ref> and subsequent papers by the same authors.

This is Theorem 4.4 from <ref> [3] </ref>, which is a reformulation of Theorem 6.1 from [2]. fl Corollary 1. <p> is easy to see that for any C 2 C, D 2 C fl , and x; y 2 C " D we must have OC (x)O fl D (x) = C (x)D (x) Hence (OR2 0 ) is also true, since O fl is orthogonal to O. fl In <ref> [3] </ref> those elements of the inner Tutte group which can be expressed as products of the form C 1 (x)C 1 (y) 1 1 - 16 - C 2 ) = 1, were called "generalized cross ratios", and some relations for them were established. <p> Proof. The proof includes Lemmas 3.2-3.5. The correctness of the definition of C 1 C 2 and the relations (CR1)-(CR5) for the images of the generators of T (2) were established in <ref> [3, Lemma 2.4, Proposition 2.5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Proof. The proof takes up the rest of this section. First we shall prove the uniqueness. It follows immediately from <ref> [6, Theorem 6.1] </ref>, but it is also quite easy to prove it directly. It is clear that it is enough to consider the case when M is connected.

Reference-contexts: Projective orientations In this paper we shall consider only finite matroids, oriented matroids etc. First we recall some basic facts and notations (see, e.g., [1], <ref> [7] </ref> and [8]). We use the definition of a matroid M as a pair (E; C), where E is the ground set and C is the set of circuits of M. <p> The sequence of points (C 1 ; : : : ; C k ) is called a path off C, if any two subsequent points are distinct points on a connected line and no point of this sequence belongs to C. The fundamental theorem about linear subclasses <ref> [7, Theorem 4.34] </ref> says that if M is connected, then for any linear subclass C and any C; C 1 2 C n C there is a path (C 1 ; : : : ; C k = C) off C. <p> We denote this circuit C by C 0 . The circuits C 0 2 C M 0 with a =2 C 0 form a linear subclass in M 0 <ref> [7, Proposition 7.412] </ref>. &gt;From [7, Theorem 4.371] we know that if M is connected, then for any two elements of E there is a circuit containing both of them. We have no reference for the following fact, so we put it here with the proof. Proposition. <p> We denote this circuit C by C 0 . The circuits C 0 2 C M 0 with a =2 C 0 form a linear subclass in M 0 [7, Proposition 7.412]. &gt;From <ref> [7, Theorem 4.371] </ref> we know that if M is connected, then for any two elements of E there is a circuit containing both of them. We have no reference for the following fact, so we put it here with the proof. Proposition. <p> As M is connected, there is a circuit containing both x and y, so if dim (E) &gt; 1, then there is a connected flat F , containing both x and y, with dim (F ) = dim (E) 2 <ref> [7, Theorem 4.25] </ref>. By [7, Theorem 4.26] there are two connected flats F 1 and F 2 with dim (F i ) = dim (E) 1, F F 1 " F 2 and F 1 [ F 2 = E. <p> As M is connected, there is a circuit containing both x and y, so if dim (E) &gt; 1, then there is a connected flat F , containing both x and y, with dim (F ) = dim (E) 2 [7, Theorem 4.25]. By <ref> [7, Theorem 4.26] </ref> there are two connected flats F 1 and F 2 with dim (F i ) = dim (E) 1, F F 1 " F 2 and F 1 [ F 2 = E. <p> Then it is also true for M. Proof. First we choose a 2 E such that M 0 = M=fag is connected (which is possible by <ref> [7, Theorem 4.25] </ref>). Then we fix circuit and cocircuit signatures on M 0 , consistent with the given projective orientation. <p> This property holds for all fuzzy integral domains (because it follows from (FR6 000 ) in [5]), but it is not true in general even for perfect fuzzy rings (for example for F 7 ==(F fl 2 In the proof of the next theorem we shall need Tutte's homotopy theory <ref> [7, Ch. 6] </ref>. Here is a brief summary of it. Let C be a linear subclass in a matroid M = (E; C). We call a path (C 1 ; : : : ; C k ) off C re-entrant if C 1 = C k . <p> Here is a brief summary of it. Let C be a linear subclass in a matroid M = (E; C). We call a path (C 1 ; : : : ; C k ) off C re-entrant if C 1 = C k . In <ref> [7, x 6.1] </ref> the following four kinds of elementary re-entrant paths were described: (1) Any path of the form (C 1 ; C 2 ; C 1 ) is called an elementary re-entrant path of the first kind. (2) Any path of the form (C 1 ; C 2 ; C <p> Two given paths P and Q are called homotopic if one can be derived from the other by a finite sequence of elementary deformations. Tutte's Homotopy Theorem. <ref> [7, Theorem 6.41] </ref> Any re-entrant path off C is homotopic to a path consisting of one point. <p> We recall that for C 0 2 C M 0 there is a unique circuit C = C 0 2 C with C n fag = C 0 , and C = C 0 ; for C 0 2 C According to <ref> [7, Theorems 4.42-4.44] </ref> can be uniquely extended to a map of the set of flats of M 0 to the set of flats of M, preserving dimensions and inclusion relations. <p> Let L 0 i = C 0 k for fi; j; kg = f1; 2; 3g. We know from <ref> [7, Theorem 4.171] </ref> that any two distinct lines on F 0 have just one common point, and from [7. Theorem 4.26] that any point on F 0 lies in the intersection of two distinct connected lines on F 0 . <p> If C 4 = C 5 (= C 6 ), then of course C 0 4 = C 4 n fag 2 C M 0 and, according to <ref> [7, Theorem 4.27] </ref>, there is a line L 0 4 on the plane P 0 = L of M 0 with C 0 4 , thus C 4 6 L 4 .

Reference-contexts: Then the reorientation class of ~ M corresponds to the map . We omit the verification that satisfies the conditions of Corollary 2 except to point out that the last one holds by the classical theorem of Menelaus <ref> [11, Theorem 7.5.5] </ref>. fl This example explains why the term "generalized cross ratio" is used for the generators C 3 C 4 of T M . Hence we could use the description provided by Corollary 2 to define projective orientations, instead of the definition given in section 2.
