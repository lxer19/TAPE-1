Title: End-User Customization Mechanisms for Distributed Information Resources  
Author: Brygg Ullmer 
Abstract: The explosive growth of the Internet has given rise to a broad array of networked information. However, the navigational challenges and general absence of structure among these heterogeneous resources are significant obstacles to its effective utilization, especially for novice users. In particular, there has been an absence of tools supporting user-level customization and manipulation of distributed information resources on the Internet. Simultaneously, the blossoming of multitopic distributed information collections has been stymied by the exclusion of users from active participation in augmenting and fleshing out these resources. This paper describes the Personal Gopher, a research application which implements intuitive provisions for the virtual creation, modification, and synthesis of personally customizable distributed information spaces, as well as first-generation distributed authoring mechanisms which enable user contribution to public resource compilations. Opportunities for future directions in the development of user-customizable distributed information spaces are also surveyed.

Reference-contexts: While the author realizes that a proliferance of menus is not necessarily to the liking of all users, this menu-based approach is most closely in keeping with the existing simplicity-oriented structure and presentation of the Gopher client. Users demanding command-line inter 4 faces are encouraged to consider Prospero <ref> [11] </ref>, though it should be noted that command-line access mechanisms to conventional Gopher resources are available. Another "market requirement" minded in the development of PGopher was inter-platform portability on the part of the application code.
