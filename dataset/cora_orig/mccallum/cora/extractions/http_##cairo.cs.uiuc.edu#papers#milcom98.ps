Abstract: In this paper we present and evaluate protocols (SMP and SMP-MH) for synchronized end-to-end multicast in real-time packet cellular networks. Our protocols extend current delay jitter control mechanisms to achieve synchronized real-time packet delivery to mobile hosts in multiple cells. We show that for a multicast session using SMP and SMP-MH: (1) the end-to-end delay bounds of each packet to the subscribing mobile hosts are identical, with small and bounded jitters, and (2) a mobile host can experience smooth, brief, and loss-less handoffs, and thus receive seamless Quality of Service (QoS).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we do not assume any single scheduling algorithm used by switches in the cellular networks. We will only assume that every switch adopts an algorithm that belongs to the class of Guaranteed Rate (GR) scheduling algorithms <ref> [3] </ref> (many well-known algorithms belong to the GR class. Refer to [3] for its formal definition). For a multicast session in cellular packet networks, in order to eliminate delay and delay jitter variations in different cells, we aim at making the arrivals of the same packet in all cells synchronized. <p> We will only assume that every switch adopts an algorithm that belongs to the class of Guaranteed Rate (GR) scheduling algorithms <ref> [3] </ref> (many well-known algorithms belong to the GR class.

Reference-contexts: Our first step towards synchronized mul 1 ticast is to control the jitter on the path from the source to mobile hosts in one cell. Based on current delay jitter control mechanisms <ref> [4] </ref>, we modify algorithms in the GR class to be jitter controlled. Consider a flow f that is associated with a rate r f . Let p j f and l f denote the jth packet of flow f and its length.

To show that both intra-path and inter-path delay jitters are controlled by SMP, we first have the following lemma.
