Abstract: The human visual system is more sensitive to the relative motion of objects than to their absolute motion. An understanding of motion perception requires an understanding of how neural circuits can group moving visual elements relative to one another, based upon hierarchical reference frames. We have modeled visual relative motion perception using a neural network architecture that groups visual elements according to Gestalt common-fate principles and exploits information about the behavior of each group to predict the behavior of individual elements. A simple competitive neural circuit binds visual elements together into a representation of a visual object. Information about the spiking pattern of neurons allows transfer of the bindings of an object representation from location to location in the neural circuit as the object moves. The model exhibits characteristics of human object grouping and solves some key neural circuit design problems in visual relative motion perception.

Reference-contexts: layer 5 neuron i receives non time-delayed input with weight equal to one from the layer 3 neurons i nd and time-delayed input from the layer 3 neuron i d . 4.4 Activation equations The output of a neuron i at time t is given by s i (t) = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> where s i = 1 indicates that i is firing. The output of each neuron is determined by layer-specific activation rules that involve one or more conditional cases. <p> neuron j at position (x; y) that responds to a similar change. 5.4 Activation equations Due to the lack of synchronization, the activation equations in this version of the model are simpler; although, the state of a neuron i at time t is still given by s i (t) = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. A neuron in layer 1 at location (x; y) fires with probability S in I (x; y). Neurons in the other layers obey the following activation rule.

Reference-contexts: A better prediction can be made if the dots are grouped together as an object. In this case (4H), the predicted motion of the occluded dot can be changed to match the change in motion of the group. Psychophysical experiments from Anstis and Ramachandran <ref> [2] </ref> indicates that the perceived motion of elements during occlusion is based upon the motion of elements undergoing similar motion. The sequence in figure 4H demonstrates the importance of generating predictions in grouping.

Reference-contexts: One advantage of grouping is that if a dot becomes occluded, as occurs in 4C, then the system can still represent the occluded dot as continuing to exist (4D). Assad <ref> [3] </ref> has presented evidence showing that the visual system signals the inferred motion of the invisible object in this type of display. Alley and Marshall [37] showed that a self-organizing neural system can learn to continue to represent the occluded element.

Reference-contexts: This idea has been previously expressed as the principle of exclusive allocation the output of a neuron should be allocated to no more than one description at a time <ref> [36, 4] </ref>. Exclusive allocation is an important concept in relative motion perception. The motion of an element should influence the computation of common motion for only the group the element belongs to.

Reference-contexts: Several researchers have previously presented neural systems capable of grouping together the motion of individual moving elements based on common fate <ref> [5, 18, 43] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although several conceptual and analytical models (for 2 example, see <ref> [25, 7] </ref>) of relative motion perception have since been proposed, a complete theory that bridges the gap between psychophysical observations and neurobiological mechanisms is still missing. As such, many important conceptual questions on relative motion perception have yet to be answered. <p> Johansson argued from studies on biological point light walkers [23] that the visual system decomposes motions into hierarchical sets of common and relative motions. Subsequent theories of motion perception <ref> [7, 45] </ref> have explored the issue of relative motion further by addressing issues such as which common motion is extracted (since the number of possible common motions is infinite) and whether common or relative motion is extracted first. <p> Figure 4 is presented as an aid in this discussion. Although this figure contains only very simple motion sequences, the depicted sequences are valuable as displays of these types have been studied by others <ref> [7, 10, 25] </ref> and because the sequences omit extraneous factors (such as depth or color) that are not essential to understanding how relative motion is processed.

Reference-contexts: Although this discussion does not address 3-D motion, the ideas are extendible to 3-D. [Figure 4 about here.] 5 When several dots have the same motion, as in figure 4A, they are seen as constituting a group (i.e., an object, figure 4B) due to their common fate <ref> [51, 8] </ref>. Several researchers have previously presented neural systems capable of grouping together the motion of individual moving elements based on common fate [5, 18, 43]. Schmitt & Marshall [47] have previously shown that such systems can self-organize in response to image sequences containing common motion.

Reference-contexts: The search results have been taken to indicate that some level of parallel processing occurs in 8 which perceptually related elements are grouped together independent of attentional selection [17, 50]. A number of visual search studies indicate that elements moving together can be selected or rejected as a group <ref> [39, 9, 11] </ref>. These results suggest that motion groups may be established in parallel and independent of attentional selection.

Reference-contexts: How the human visual system analyzes and decomposes motion, however, is known to be dependent upon the perceptual organization of elements in the scene. Consider the rotating wheel display from Duncker <ref> [10] </ref>, shown in figure 3. If the two elements in the display are perceived as separate objects, subjects will perceive a horizontally moving dot and a bouncing dot, as in figure 3A. If the two elements are perceptually grouped, subjects will perceive a rotating wheel, as in figure 3B. <p> Figure 4 is presented as an aid in this discussion. Although this figure contains only very simple motion sequences, the depicted sequences are valuable as displays of these types have been studied by others <ref> [7, 10, 25] </ref> and because the sequences omit extraneous factors (such as depth or color) that are not essential to understanding how relative motion is processed. <p> The intent of this version is to test the model on the Duncker rotating wheel display <ref> [10] </ref> that requires two moving elements to be represented as a single object in motion with one element rotating about the other. The architecture of the extended model is shown in figure 9.

Reference-contexts: The spiking of neurons associated with different objects are desynchronized. This approach has the potential to allow multiple objects to be bound together during the same time interval. The approach also has experimental support from studies in the cat <ref> [13] </ref> and monkey [29] showing stimulus-specific synchronization of neural spiking. Evidence suggesting which approach the visual system uses in motion perception comes from psychophysical studies of visual search. In visual search [49], researchers study how quickly subjects can identify a target object that differs from surrounding objects in some manner.

Reference-contexts: In short, a theory of motion perception must address the binding problem [40] - i.e., the problem of identifying which neurons are associated with which objects as the bindings established by the visual system determine how motion is perceived. Only a model by Goddard <ref> [14] </ref> on the recognition of biological motion has addressed the issues of relative motion and binding. The model, however, makes use of several constructs that are not clearly neurobiologically plausible. In addition, the model does not handle multiple objects without attention. <p> The theory proposed here adopts this assumption. 2.4 Binding in Relative Motion Although a number of binding models based on synchronization exist [22, 15, 31, 12], only a few models <ref> [26, 14] </ref> have addressed binding when motion is involved.

Reference-contexts: In these examples, each dot provides a reference frame [25] against which the other dot's motion is perceived. [Figure 1 about here.] Image displays such as the point light walker (biological motion), created by Johansson <ref> [23] </ref>, show that such reference frames are organized hierarchically. In point light walker displays (see figure 2), a person (or other animal), visible only through a few lights placed on the person's body (usually on body joints), is seen to walk across a display. <p> Section 6 presents results of simulating the models. Section 7 and 8 present a discussion and conclusion. 3 2 Review of Relative Motion Perception 2.1 Perceptual Organization and Binding in Motion Perception Johansson <ref> [23, 24] </ref> presented one of the first analytical theories of relative motion. The theory, termed perceptual vector analysis, is based on the idea that the common motion of a set of moving elements provides the background, or reference frame, for the relative motion of each element. <p> The theory, termed perceptual vector analysis, is based on the idea that the common motion of a set of moving elements provides the background, or reference frame, for the relative motion of each element. Johansson argued from studies on biological point light walkers <ref> [23] </ref> that the visual system decomposes motions into hierarchical sets of common and relative motions. <p> However, the architecture itself was designed to be extendible so that multiple levels can be easily handled. This extendibility was illustrated in the modifications made to handle grouping in the rotating wheel display. Conceptually, further extensions to handle more complex situations, such as the point light walker display <ref> [23] </ref>, can be made in the same manner. In the architecture, the element motion and group motion layers provide an initial grouping of elements.

Reference-contexts: If two dots are moving relative to a stationary featureless background, their motion relative to each other is easier to detect than their motion relative to the background. In these examples, each dot provides a reference frame <ref> [25] </ref> against which the other dot's motion is perceived. [Figure 1 about here.] Image displays such as the point light walker (biological motion), created by Johansson [23], show that such reference frames are organized hierarchically. <p> Although several conceptual and analytical models (for 2 example, see <ref> [25, 7] </ref>) of relative motion perception have since been proposed, a complete theory that bridges the gap between psychophysical observations and neurobiological mechanisms is still missing.

Although this figure contains only very simple motion sequences, the depicted sequences are valuable as displays of these types have been studied by others <ref> [7, 10, 25] </ref> and because the sequences omit extraneous factors (such as depth or color) that are not essential to understanding how relative motion is processed. <p> Subjects viewing this type of display often perceive a single object moving vertically with the middle dot sliding back and forth between the outside dots <ref> [25] </ref>, as in 4J. This type of display is difficult to handle for motion theories that do not solve the binding problem as the lack of motion similarity suggests the elements should not be grouped together.

Reference-contexts: These theories typically fall into two categories: attention-based mechanisms and synchronization-based mechanisms (dynamic weight approaches [33] could be considered a third category; however, these schemes cannot be used independently of other schemes). In attention-based schemes <ref> [26] </ref>, attentional selection of an object causes the firing rate of all neurons associated with the object to become enhanced. The enhanced firing rate differentiates the selected neurons from neurons associated with other objects. <p> The theory proposed here adopts this assumption. 2.4 Binding in Relative Motion Although a number of binding models based on synchronization exist [22, 15, 31, 12], only a few models <ref> [26, 14] </ref> have addressed binding when motion is involved.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, a wealth of related research has provided addition information suggesting how the visual system analyzes and decomposes the absolute motions within image sequences.

Reference-contexts: the wrist is perceived as motion relative to the elbow that is, in turn, moving relative to the shoulder and trunk. [Figure 2 about here.] The importance of relative motion and hierarchical organization to motion perception was recognized as early as the 1930s by Gestalt psychophysicists such as Koffka (see <ref> [28] </ref> for review of Koffka's work, as well as work of other researchers of that time).

This idea has support from findings <ref> [30, 41] </ref> that show the existence of attention-based modulation of neural firing rates in the visual system. In synchronization-based schemes [40, 32], the spiking of neurons associated with the same object are synchronized. The spiking of neurons associated with different objects are desynchronized.

However, the inhibitory connections hidden within the binding pathways are between interneurons associated with the same pre-synaptic neuron.

Reference-contexts: This idea has been previously expressed as the principle of exclusive allocation the output of a neuron should be allocated to no more than one description at a time <ref> [36, 4] </ref>. Exclusive allocation is an important concept in relative motion perception. The motion of an element should influence the computation of common motion for only the group the element belongs to.

Reference-contexts: Assad [3] has presented evidence showing that the visual system signals the inferred motion of the invisible object in this type of display. Alley and Marshall <ref> [37] </ref> showed that a self-organizing neural system can learn to continue to represent the occluded element. The importance of grouping is demonstrated further in figure 4E-H. In 4E, three moving dots are grouped together into a single object (4F) based on common fate.

Reference-contexts: The search results have been taken to indicate that some level of parallel processing occurs in 8 which perceptually related elements are grouped together independent of attentional selection [17, 50]. A number of visual search studies indicate that elements moving together can be selected or rejected as a group <ref> [39, 9, 11] </ref>. These results suggest that motion groups may be established in parallel and independent of attentional selection.

Reference-contexts: In short, a theory of motion perception must address the binding problem <ref> [40] </ref> - i.e., the problem of identifying which neurons are associated with which objects as the bindings established by the visual system determine how motion is perceived. Only a model by Goddard [14] on the recognition of biological motion has addressed the issues of relative motion and binding. <p> The importance of prediction success is a reflection of the fact that elements belonging to the same object typically undergo the same changes in 7 motion. 2.3 Approaches to Binding Since the binding problem was first explored by Milner <ref> [40] </ref>, a number of neurobiologically-plausible theories for its solution have been proposed and examined. These theories typically fall into two categories: attention-based mechanisms and synchronization-based mechanisms (dynamic weight approaches [33] could be considered a third category; however, these schemes cannot be used independently of other schemes). <p> The enhanced firing rate differentiates the selected neurons from neurons associated with other objects. This idea has support from findings [30, 41] that show the existence of attention-based modulation of neural firing rates in the visual system. In synchronization-based schemes <ref> [40, 32] </ref>, the spiking of neurons associated with the same object are synchronized. The spiking of neurons associated with different objects are desynchronized. This approach has the potential to allow multiple objects to be bound together during the same time interval.

Reference-contexts: In attention-based schemes [26], attentional selection of an object causes the firing rate of all neurons associated with the object to become enhanced. The enhanced firing rate differentiates the selected neurons from neurons associated with other objects. This idea has support from findings <ref> [30, 41] </ref> that show the existence of attention-based modulation of neural firing rates in the visual system. In synchronization-based schemes [40, 32], the spiking of neurons associated with the same object are synchronized. The spiking of neurons associated with different objects are desynchronized.

Reference-contexts: This is a difficult task in neural circuitry as elements can be bound to groups based on a number of factors (not just similar motion), and multiple groups of elements may co-exist in the same region of space. Nigrin <ref> [42] </ref> recently presented a neural circuit capable of exclusively allocating resources between bound neurons. The circuit presented by Nigrin is based on the concept of "link-competition". Essentially, the output pathways from a neuron compete for which post-synaptic target the neuron is "allowed" to influence. <p> This paper introduces the concept of binding pathways (based on link competition from Nigrin <ref> [42] </ref>) for this purpose. The conceptualization of a binding pathway, shown in figure 6A, is one in which the afferent axonal pathways emanating from a source neuron compete for the "right" to carry signals.

Reference-contexts: Several researchers have previously presented neural systems capable of grouping together the motion of individual moving elements based on common fate <ref> [5, 18, 43] </ref>. Schmitt & Marshall [47] have previously shown that such systems can self-organize in response to image sequences containing common motion.

Reference-contexts: The procedure for setting the feedforward weights (and therefore the feedback weights) follows. The element motion neurons in layer 2, the motion of element motion neurons in layer 4, and the motion 18 of group motion neurons in layer 5 are modeled as bilocal motion detectors <ref> [44] </ref>. Bilocal motion detectors receive input from two spatially offset regions where input from one region is temporally delayed relative to the other region. In the model, each bilocal motion detector receives input from two spatially offset neurons.

Reference-contexts: Johansson argued from studies on biological point light walkers [23] that the visual system decomposes motions into hierarchical sets of common and relative motions. Subsequent theories of motion perception <ref> [7, 45] </ref> have explored the issue of relative motion further by addressing issues such as which common motion is extracted (since the number of possible common motions is infinite) and whether common or relative motion is extracted first.

Reference-contexts: Several researchers have previously presented neural systems capable of grouping together the motion of individual moving elements based on common fate [5, 18, 43]. Schmitt & Marshall <ref> [47] </ref> have previously shown that such systems can self-organize in response to image sequences containing common motion. One advantage of grouping is that if a dot becomes occluded, as occurs in 4C, then the system can still represent the occluded dot as continuing to exist (4D). <p> Prior work has shown that a similar versions of the element, element motion, and group motion layers are capable of developing through self-organization <ref> [34, 38, 35, 47] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For instance, research suggests how the motion of elements relative to the optical flow field is extracted [27], how structure is extracted from motion [51, 20, 19], and how motions might be decomposed into rigid and non-rigid components <ref> [21, 48] </ref>. How the human visual system analyzes and decomposes motion, however, is known to be dependent upon the perceptual organization of elements in the scene. Consider the rotating wheel display from Duncker [10], shown in figure 3.

Reference-contexts: The approach also has experimental support from studies in the cat [13] and monkey [29] showing stimulus-specific synchronization of neural spiking. Evidence suggesting which approach the visual system uses in motion perception comes from psychophysical studies of visual search. In visual search <ref> [49] </ref>, researchers study how quickly subjects can identify a target object that differs from surrounding objects in some manner. For example, a blue square may appear in a field of blue circles and red squares.
