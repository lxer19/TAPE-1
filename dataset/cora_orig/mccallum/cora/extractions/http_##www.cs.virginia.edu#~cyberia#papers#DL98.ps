Abstract: When a digital library is decomposed into many geographically distributed repositories, search efficiency becomes an issue. Increasing network congestion makes this a compelling issue. We discuss an effective method for reducing the number of servers needed to respond to a query and give examples of search space reduction in the NCSTRL distributed digital library.

Reference-contexts: This has been called the collection selection problem by Callan et al.[1], while Gravano et al.[3] refer to it as the text database resource discovery. It is also referred to as database selection <ref> [2] </ref>. The database selection problem is generally formulated as: given a query q, rank the available databases in order of presumed utility to q.

Reference-contexts: NCSTRL NCSTRL is the Networked Computer Science Technical Reports Library, a collection of the technical reports of over 100 computer science departments and research laboratories worldwide. At the present time NCSTRL includes about 22,000 technical reports. It is a distributed architecture based on an open protocol, DIENST <ref> [4] </ref>. NCSTRL participants elect to participate as either standard or lite sites. Standard sites support user interface, index and repository services; lite sites provide a repository only and are indexed at the NCSTRL Central Server which is itself a modified standard site.

Reference-contexts: More sophisticated parsing could be used to preserve these constructions, but the effect on the work reported here is minimal. Stemmed Title Words Titles words were extracted as above and then conflated using a stemming algorithm due to Paice <ref> [5] </ref>. We were interested to see if stemmed title words would retain the selectivity to be of use in search space reduction. Cases to Consider We used 39 NCSTRL standard sites and 43 NCSTRL lite sites from the Central Server as the basis for this analysis.
