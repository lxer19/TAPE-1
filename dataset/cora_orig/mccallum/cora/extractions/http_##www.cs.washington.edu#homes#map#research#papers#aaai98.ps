Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in user interface design. In IJCAI '97, we challenged the AI community to address this problem by creating adaptive web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation by mining visitor access data collected in Web server logs. In this paper we introduce our own approach to this broad challenge. Specifically, we investigate the problem of index page synthesis | the automatic creation of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Web site. First, we formalize this problem as a clustering problem and introduce a novel approach to clustering, which we call cluster mining: Instead of attempting to partition the entire data space into disjoint clusters, we search for a small number of cohesive (and possibly overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather, a cluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs as input and outputs the contents of candidate index pages. Finally, we show experimentally that PageGather is both faster (by a factor of three) and more effective than traditional clustering algorithms on this task. Our experiment relies on access logs collected over a month from an actual web site. Designing a rich web site so that it readily yields its information can be tricky. The problem of good web design is compounded by several factors. First, different visitors have distinct goals. Second, the same visitor may seek different information at different times. Third, many sites outgrow their original design, accumulating links and pages in unlikely places. Fourth, a site may be designed for a particular kind of use, but be used in many different ways in practice; the designer's a priori expectations may be violated. Too often web site designs are fossils cast in HTML, while web navigation is dynamic, time-dependent, and idiosyncratic. In (Perkowitz & Etzioni 1997a), we challenged the AI community to address this problem by creating adaptive web sites: web sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation by learning from visitor access patterns. In this paper we report on our own progress. Sites may be adaptive in two basic ways. Customization is adapting the site's presentation to the needs of individual visitors, based on information about those individuals. In order to specialize itself to individual users, the site must maintain multiple copies of itself and gather quite a bit of information from users. Providing such information to the site can be time-consuming and may be an invasion of privacy. Optimization is improving the site's structure based on interactions with all visitors. Instead of making changes for each individual, the site learns from numerous past visitors to make the site easier to use for all, including those who have never used it before. While previous work has focused on customizing web sites, we chose to investigate web site optimization through the automatic synthesis of index pages. In the next section, we discuss our general approach and present the index page synthesis problem. We then present our technique, which we call cluster mining, and its instantiation in the PageGather algorithm; Page-Gather solves the subproblem of automatically synthesizing the set of links that comprises an index page. Following, we present the results of experiments run using our implemented system. Finally, we discuss related work and future directions. Our approach to adaptive web sites is motivated by four goals: (1) avoiding additional work for visitors (e.g. filling out questionnaires); (2) making the web site easier to use for everyone, not just specific individuals; (3) using web sites as they are, without relying on meta-information not currently available (e.g., XML annotations); and (4) protecting the site's original design from destructive changes. When creating a web site, a human meticulously designs the look and feel of the site, the structure of the information, and the kinds of interactions available. When making automatic changes to such a site, we wish to avoid damaging the site. Our approach, therefore, is to apply only nondestructive transformations: changes to the site that leave ex
