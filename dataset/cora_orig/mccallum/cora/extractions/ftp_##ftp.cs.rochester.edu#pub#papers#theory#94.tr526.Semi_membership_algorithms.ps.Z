Title: Semi-Membership Algorithms: Some Recent Advances  
Author: Derek Denny-Brown Yenjo Han Lane A. Hemaspaandra Leen Torenvliet 
Date: July 1994  
Abstract: A semi-membership algorithm for a set A is, informally, a program that when given any two strings determines which is logically more likely to be in A. A flurry of interest in this topic in the late seventies and early eighties was followed by a relatively quiescent half-decade. However, in the 1990s there has been a resurgence of interest in this topic. We survey recent work on the theory of semi-membership algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Disjunctive self-reducibility has been a very central property in the long line of research on whether NP has sparse complete sets with respect to various reducibilities (the current state of this line can be seen in <ref> [AHH + 93] </ref>, and slightly outdated surveys of the line as a whole can be found in [HOW92,You92]), and has reappeared in the study of selectivity.

Reference-contexts: For example, the theorem below states that one-truth-table reduction to P-selective sets yields the same class as one-truth-table equivalence to P-selective sets. In contrast, the same result is known for sparse sets only under the (rather strong) additional assumption that P = NP <ref> [AHOW92] </ref>. In the course of proving the theorem below, [HHO94] in fact proves that R p 2-tt (P-selective) E p T (P-selective) is non-empty. In contrast, it is known that proving the analogous result for sparse sets would immediately establish that P 6= NP [AHOW92]. <p> additional assumption that P = NP <ref> [AHOW92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, under the assumption that E 6= UE, Buhrman [Buh93, Theorem 7.29] proves the existence of a disjunctive self-reducible set in NP that is Turing reducible to a P-selective set yet is not in P.

Reference-contexts: Among the results surveyed are a result of Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet [BvHT93] that P is exactly the class of sets that are both P-selective and Turing self-reducible, a result of Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Emde Boas <ref> [BTvEB93] </ref> (respectively, of Ogihara, and Agrawal and Arvind, and Beigel, Kummer, and Stephan [Ogi94,AA94,BKS94]) that if NP has a positive-Turing-hard (respectively, bounded-truth-table-hard) P-selective set then P = NP, a result of Cai, Naik, and Selman [CNS94] that if NP has a truth-table-hard P-selective set then NP falls into a surprisingly small <p> Indeed, Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Emde Boas <ref> [BTvEB93] </ref> show that the class of sets that positive-Turing reduce to P-selective sets is the class of P-selective sets itself.

Reference-contexts: Buhrman et al. proved an extension in the direction of reductions to P-selective sets by showing: Theorem 4.5 ([BvHT93]) If A is Turing self-reducible, B is P-selective, and A p then A 2P. On the other hand, under the assumption that E 6= UE, Buhrman <ref> [Buh93, Theorem 7.29] </ref> proves the existence of a disjunctive self-reducible set in NP that is Turing reducible to a P-selective set yet is not in P.

Reference-contexts: One unifying theme of these sections is their emphasis on the interrelations between P-selective sets and various polynomial-time reducibilities. Among the results surveyed are a result of Buhrman, van Helden, and Torenvliet <ref> [BvHT93] </ref> that P is exactly the class of sets that are both P-selective and Turing self-reducible, a result of Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Emde Boas [BTvEB93] (respectively, of Ogihara, and Agrawal and Arvind, and Beigel, Kummer, and Stephan [Ogi94,AA94,BKS94]) that if NP has a positive-Turing-hard (respectively, bounded-truth-table-hard) P-selective set then P <p> SAT is a well-known disjunctive self-reducible set and it has long been known [Sel79,Ko83] that disjunctive self-reducible P-selective sets (in fact positive truth-table self-reducible sets) are in P. This result was recently extended by Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Helden <ref> [BvHT93] </ref>. Theorem 4.4 ([BvHT93]) Any Turing self-reducible P-selective set is in P. We include a version of the proof of Theorem 4.4, rendering it as a story. With luck, this is more understandable than a formal proof, though it is obviously less explicit.

Reference-contexts: Deterministic polynomial-time semi-membership algorithms (and the associated P-selective or semi-feasible sets) were introduced in the 1970s by Selman [Sel79]. Nondeterministic polynomial-time semi-membership algorithms, both partial and total (and the associated NPSV p -selective and NP-selective sets), were introduced in the 1990s by, respectively, Hemaspaandra, Naik, Ogihara, and Selman <ref> [HNOS94] </ref> and Hemaspaandra, Hoene, Ogiwara, Selman, Thierauf, and Wang [HHO + 93]. <p> The application regards the following question: Is there a single-valued (partial) NP function that, whenever given a satisfiable formula as input, outputs a satisfying assignment? As an application of their results on nondeterministic semi-membership algorithms, Hemaspaandra et al. <ref> [HNOS94] </ref> have shown that if such a function exists, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses. This result is somewhat nonintuitive|especially as it is easy to see that NP functions can find all satisfying assignments for SAT. <p> Watanabe [Wat94] has taken a first step towards a resolution.

Theorem 2.7 ([HNOS94]) NPSV-selective NP=poly T coNP=poly. The optimal number of bits of advice needed for nonuniform acceptance of selective sets has recently been established <ref> [HT94] </ref>. The following result shows that sets of relatively low nonuniform complexity are in the extended low hierarchy. Theorem 2.8 should be contrasted with the result of Kobler [Kob93] that (NP T coNP)=poly is "theta three extended low"; the two results are incomparable.

Fu and Li [FL93], extending a result of Ogihara and Watanabe [OW91], prove the following result about "weakly P-selective sets <ref> [Ko83] </ref>" and NP-hardness.

Reference-contexts: The optimal number of bits of advice needed for nonuniform acceptance of selective sets has recently been established [HT94]. The following result shows that sets of relatively low nonuniform complexity are in the extended low hierarchy. Theorem 2.8 should be contrasted with the result of Kobler <ref> [Kob93] </ref> that (NP T coNP)=poly is "theta three extended low"; the two results are incomparable. Theorem 2.8 ([HNOS94]) (NP=poly) T (coNP=poly) is ExtendedLow 3 . From Theorems 2.7 and 2.8, it follows that the NPSV-selective sets are extended low. Corollary 2.9 ([HNOS94]) The NPSV-selective sets are ExtendedLow 3 .

Reference-contexts: However, even though the fact that a set is (for example) the union of two P-selective sets does not perforce imply that it is P-selective, it does imply that the set is contained in certain of the recently defined generalizations of the P-selective sets (for example, the membership-comparable sets <ref> [Ogi94] </ref> and the multiselective sets [HJRW]), and thus is subject to the many results proving that these generalized classes contain only structurally simple sets. Hemaspaandra, Jiang, Rothe, and Watanabe [HJRW] establish a similarly at-first puzzling result. <p> Beigel, Kummer, and Stephan [BKS94, Theorem 7.1] observe that Theorem 4.5 cannot be extended to 2-truth-table reductions via any relativizable technique. Beigel et al. [BKS94], Ogihara <ref> [Ogi94] </ref>, and Agrawal and Arvind [AA94] independently returned to the more restrictive domain of disjunctive self-reducibility, and within that restricted domain extended the type of truth-table reducibility from the reducibility found in Theorem 4.5.

Reference-contexts: The following results are worth mentioning because they involve P-selective sets, although the results are also related to the study of sparse sets. Rao <ref> [Rao94] </ref> defines the 10 class of P-selective-close sets as the class of sets that have a sparse symmetric difference with a P-selective set.

Reference-contexts: Semi-membership algorithms have been studied in a number of settings. Recursive semi-membership algorithms (and the associated semi-recursive sets|those sets having recursive semi-membership algorithms) were introduced in the 1960s by Jockush [Joc79]. Deterministic polynomial-time semi-membership algorithms (and the associated P-selective or semi-feasible sets) were introduced in the 1970s by Selman <ref> [Sel79] </ref>. Nondeterministic polynomial-time semi-membership algorithms, both partial and total (and the associated NPSV p -selective and NP-selective sets), were introduced in the 1990s by, respectively, Hemaspaandra, Naik, Ogihara, and Selman [HNOS94] and Hemaspaandra, Hoene, Ogiwara, Selman, Thierauf, and Wang [HHO + 93]. <p> This class is commonly referred to as the P-selective sets (and we will also use this shorthand), and was first studied by Selman <ref> [Sel79] </ref>. In Section 4 of this paper, we will survey a line of research asking what consequences follow if, e.g., NP has a bounded-truth-table-hard P-selective set. It is now known (see Theorem 4.6) that this hypothesis implies P = NP. However, arriving at that result took a long time. <p> Indeed, Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Emde Boas [BTvEB93] show that the class of sets that positive-Turing reduce to P-selective sets is the class of P-selective sets itself. The best previously known result along these lines was the analogous result for positive-truth-table reductions, which was obtained by Selman <ref> [Sel79] </ref> over a decade earlier! Theorem 4.1 ([BTvEB93]) For any set A and any P-selective set B, if A p posT B then A p m B, and thus A is P-selective. Corollary 4.2 ([BTvEB93]) If all NP sets p posT -reduce to P-selective sets then P=NP.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we mention first the classic construction technique of Selman, and then mention some new work that provides a new construction technique. Selman <ref> [Sel82] </ref> gave the following straightforward method of producing P-selective sets. Let r be a real number written in binary and let r n denote its nth bit.

Reference-contexts: Hypothesis U (see <ref> [Sel94] </ref>) There exists an NPSV function (that is, a single-valued NP function in the standard sense [BLS84]|the output from an NP machine for which each accepting path has an output, and all outputs on a given input are the same) h such that for each Boolean formula F , it holds <p> Since we believe that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse, in light of Theorem 2.1 we must conclude that Hypothesis U is unlikely to hold. Before Theorem 2.1 was proven, the strongest known consequence of the truth of Hypothesis U was a certain nice result of Selman <ref> [Sel94] </ref> regarding separability of NP-Turing-complete sets, but that result was not then (and still is not) known to imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. <p> It is not hard to see that any NPSV "refinement" (that is, a function having the same domain, and having values always a (perhaps non-proper) subset of the function being refined) of an NPMV-selector for a set A in fact is an NPSV-selector for A. It is known <ref> [Sel94] </ref> that Hypothesis U is equivalent to the statement that all NPMV functions have NPSV refinements.

Reference-contexts: In fact, informally stated, extended lowness is about the number of quantifiers required to extract information from a set|that is, it is a measure of a set's organizational complexity, rather than of its conventional computational complexity. 4 Which Sets Reduce to P-Selective Sets? As Toda <ref> [Tod91] </ref> remarked, the interesting reductions to P-selective sets are the non-positive reductions. Indeed, Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Emde Boas [BTvEB93] show that the class of sets that positive-Turing reduce to P-selective sets is the class of P-selective sets itself. <p> The more interesting hunt is to find not just which sets reduce to P-selective sets, but which interesting sets reduce to P-selective sets. Results are often of a conditional sort: "If some set reduces to a P-selective set, then some unlikely collapse happens." Toda <ref> [Tod91] </ref> showed the following important result. (R, UP, and FewP denote, respectively, random polynomial time, unambiguous polynomial time, and polynomial bounded-ambiguity nondeterministic polynomial time (see, e.g., [Joh90]).) Theorem 4.3 ([Tod91]) 1. If all sets in UP are p tt -reducible to P-selective sets then P = UP. 2.

Reference-contexts: Does this relaxed hypothesis still collapse the polynomial hierarchy to NP NP ? This question is currently open (and interesting!). Watanabe <ref> [Wat94] </ref> has taken a first step towards a resolution. He shows that one may relax the hypothesis to polynomially-valued functions if one adds a certain constraint on the behavior of h. Below, we quickly summarize some of the other main results of Hemaspaandra et al. [HNOS94].
