Abstract: Cell losses should be extremely rare events in ATM systems. An end-to-end loss rate of 10 -9 is a typical objective. In spite of this, cell losses represent severe service degradations, and measurements of cell losses are important to validate system performance. However, real time measurements in this range take from days to months and measurements on simulated systems orders of magnitude more. This paper introduces an accelerated measurement technique for ATM systems. It requires no control of the target system, it only rely on the ability to be given continuously feedback of the target system response. The approach is therefore applicable to measurements of real systems, as well as on simulators. The measurement is divided into periods defined by load cycles and unbiased estimates are obtained by combining two variance reduction techniques: Importance sampling is used to provoke cell losses by increasing the ratio of high load situ

Reference-contexts: It is likely that the expected and measured fraction of the actual traffic during overshoots will be a better control. In general, a further improvement of the variance reduction obtained is expected by applying a more accurate uid ow approximation, <ref> [1] </ref>, taking the buffer length into account.

Reference-contexts: The applicability of these for complex load generation scenarios with a large number of source type parameters is not yet investigated. Rare event theory is a basis for finding optimal parameter values <ref> [2] </ref>. For general application, the Composite source model is too complex. Kesidis and Walrand have obtained theoretical results for uid ow models having load generation with similarities to that of the Composite source model [9]. Unfortunately, the computational problem in obtaining the actual parameters remains. <p> Regard a set of simple generators (A, B, ) with a total of sources of the same two state source type, see the illustration in Figure 5. Two approaches have been used. If the slow random walk technique, <ref> [2] </ref>, is applied, it is obtained that the optimal transition rates during stress are the ones in the unstressed system interchanged, i.e. (6) It is seen that this result is difficult to apply in a multi generator setting, since the bias of each source is dependent on internal state of all

Reference-contexts: However, to make importance sampling work successfully, it is mandatory that the trajectories sampled by the biased parameters are a representative subset of those which are most likely to cause cell losses in an unbiased system. If this is not the case, severe underestimation may result, see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>. This indicates that the likelihood ratio should not become too small, e.g. many orders of magnitude less than the cell loss probability times the typical loss burst size. This is used as a criteria for stopping the stressing, cf. Section 4. <p> For application of importance sampling in dependability simulation heuristics are derived, see for instance [5]. Our initial approach were to apply these in a simulation study of ATM systems.

Reference-contexts: Obtaining bias values There is, unfortunately, no simple way to choose which parameters to bias and how much bias to apply, to obtain the desired results. For application of importance sampling in dependability simulation heuristics are derived, see for instance <ref> [5] </ref>.
