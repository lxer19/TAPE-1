Abstract: A linear wirelength objective more effectively captures timing, congestion, and other global placement considerations than a squared wirelength objective. The GORDIAN-L cell placement tool [19] minimizes linear wirelength by first approximating the linear wirelength objective by a modified squared wirelength objective, then executing the following loop - (1) minimize the current objective to yield some approximate solution, and (2) use the resulting solution to construct a more accurate objective - until the solution converges. This paper shows how to apply a generalization [5, 6] of a 1937 algorithm due to Weiszfeld [22] to placement with a linear wirelength objective, and that the main GORDIAN-L loop is actually a special case of this algorithm. We then propose applying a regularization parameter to the generalized Weiszfeld algorithm to control the tradeoff between convergence and solution accuracy; the GORDIAN-L iteration is equivalent to setting this regularization parameter to zero. We also apply novel numerical methods, such as the Primal Newton and Primal-Dual Newton iterations, to optimize the linear wirelength objective. Finally, we show both theoretically and empirically that the Primal-Dual Newton iteration stably attains quadratic convergence, while the generalized Weiszfeld iteration is linear convergent. Hence, Primal-Dual Newton is a superior choice for implementing a placer such as GORDIAN-L, or for any linear wirelength optimization.

In this section, we develop what we call the Primal Newton method for minimizing the linear wirelength objective. <p> No precise mathematical statement about global convergence of Primal-Dual Newton has been proven, but its reliable convergence properties have been observed in the literature (e.g. <ref> [2, 15] </ref>) and our experiments. 13 rows of matrix C are precisely C j and utilizing some linear algebra) as follows: " H 0 ffix ffi = K (x; ) # where M (x) = C T E (x) F (x)C (15) and the following notations are used: * K (x; <p> residual | the right hand side of (14) | goes to zero as the Newton method progresses. 6 The Primal-Dual Newton Method The idea of the primal-dual Newton approach was developed by Conn and Overton in [4] and has been recently used for a denoising application in image processing (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Numerical results suggest that the approach has fast convergence, stability and significant practical value. Recall that the optimization problem we will solve is: find x which minimizes f (x) = j=1 (C j x) 2 + fi s. t. <p> In the overall algorithm, ffiz gives an update direction for z, and we are free to use ffiz with any factor we want. However, as noted in <ref> [2, p.9] </ref>, for the matrix in (29) to be nonsingular one requires k z k k 1 1. <p> We have observed in our experiments that if for some reason (29) is not solved precisely enough, Newton top-level iterates can start to diverge. The remarks given for the Primal Newton method above also apply to Primal-Dual Newton (see <ref> [2] </ref>); in particular, Primal-Dual Newton possesses quadratic convergence (see [12, 5.4.1]) and is preferable to the linearly convergent Weiszfeld algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The solution to any given one-dimensional placement can be refined in various ways, e.g., the PROUD algorithm of [21] applies min-cut partitioning to induce hierarchical subproblems, and the GORDIAN algorithm of <ref> [13] </ref> applies min-cut partitioning as well as center-of-gravity constraints that define more constrained version of the original problem. The heart of the quadratic placement technique lies in solving for the one-dimensional placements. <p> Quadratic placers vary mostly in how they map a global placement to a feasible cell placement (i.e., with non-overlapped cells in legal locations). Min-cut partitioning and center-of-gravity constraints are simply means of gradually "spreading out" the global placement during the course of this mapping. The well-known example of GORDIAN <ref> [13] </ref> uses a conjugate-gradient iteration to solve for optimal cell locations under the squared wirelength objective, then partitions the cells by assigning each cell to one of four centers of gravity that correspond to the four quadrants of the layout. <p> A weight function w : E ! &lt; + assigns a nonnegative weight w (e) to each edge in e.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a strongly connected cluster may be spread out over the placement which increases wiring congestion for the router. The extra wiring caused by the spread of highly connected components can also reduce the routing resource flexibility needed to satisfy timing and signal integrity constraints.

Reference-contexts: This is repeated until some convergence criterion is met. We call this particular implementation of the Newton method Primal Newton. The Primal Newton method does not possess any kind of global convergence property. Local convergence takes place | a proof can be found in <ref> [17] </ref> | but we do not know of any estimates of the size of the local convergence region. One can use various globalization techniques (e.g., line search and trust regions) to guarantee convergence of the Primal Newton method everywhere.
