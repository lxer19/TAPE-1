Reference: <editor> may indicate that a distinguishing feature is missing. </editor> <title> If, however, there is no discriminating feature, and it cannot even be constructed during the course of our first learning task, then a probablistic approach may help to decide what to do. The formal analysis of such problems is the subject of current ongoing investigation. References </title>

Reference-contexts: In contrast to previous approaches to learning in robotics, such as Explanation Based Learning [Segre, 1988], [Zercher, 1992], or subsymbolic techniques [Millan and Torras, 1991], we apply inductive logic programming to robot navigation. Bratko and his colleagues apply inductive logic programming to descriptions of real-world processes, too <ref> [Bratko et al., 1992] </ref>. Our aim of automatically building up higher and more qualitative levels of describing events is similar to their qualitative modeling of physical systems in very general ways only.

Reference-contexts: It is a misleading term, as the features are not a subset of sensory data. 4 2 TWO LEARNING TASKS <ref> [De Jong and Mooney, 1986] </ref>. You cannot drink from such a receptacle. Therefore, it cannot be a cup. Of course, one can add a feature stating that the handle must be on the side.

Reference-contexts: If the action is not successful, it does not belong to the concept. In this way, actions are integrated into concept descriptions and into their application as recognition functions. Similarly, Giordana has proposed to use executable features (executable predicates) in concept descriptions <ref> [Giordana et al., 1990] </ref> . These features are true for an object if a particular handling of this object is successful. For instance, the feature "movable" for a concept can be verified by moving that object.

Reference-contexts: A hierarchical architecture of the navigation system is assumed <ref> [Kaelbling, 1987] </ref>. Whereas reinforcement learning is applied to low-level learning tasks such as obstacle avoidance [Millan and Torras, 1991] and learning macro-operators is applied to the planning level [Spandl and Pitschke, 1991] we investigate learning operational concepts from sensory data.

Reference-contexts: Let RS be a rule schema, then RS is an (partially) instantiated one. If all predicate variables in RS are substituted by predicate symbols, RS is a rule. P1 (Trace,SAlpha,S,T1,T2,Value1) & P2 (Trace,SAlpha,S,T2,T3,Value2) & P1 (Trace,SAlpha,S,T3,T4,Value3) ! P3 (Trace,S,T1,T4,M). According to Kietz and Wroble <ref> [Kietz and Wrobel, 1991] </ref>, rule schemata are ordered with respect to their generality such that the generality of fully instantiated rule schemata is given by theta-subsumption [Plotkin, 1970]. Within the representation formalism, the representation language for our application has to be declared. <p> The sensors at the front constantly measure the back wall of the room, edge 6. This is what human inspectors of the sensory data realize. The issue now is to have the system detect these relations by machine learning. The learning module of the MOBAL system, RDT <ref> [Kietz and Wrobel, 1991] </ref>, is applied to solve this complex learning task. RDT is a model-based inductive learning algorithm which learns instantiations of rule schemata. RDT learns from most general rules to more special rules.

Reference-contexts: We assume a hierarchical robot architecture where several learning techniques are applied at all levels <ref> [Knieriemen, 1991] </ref>. At all levels, perception-oriented and action-oriented processing is related (see figure 1).

Reference-contexts: All these ways cannot be excluded by features in the concept and object descriptions. Presumably, for any list of features that a cup cannot have, we could construct an additional exceptional feature which hinders drinking from a receptacle. This is the frame problem <ref> [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969] </ref>. The frame problem indicates that observational features alone are not adequate. What is most important about a cup is that one can drink from it. Drinking is a verifying action for a cup.

Reference-contexts: A description of the system including detailed chapters about the representation formalism is <ref> [Morik et al., 1993] </ref>. 7 Rules We may view the rules in MOBAL as Horn clauses. If the premises can be instantiated by positive facts, the conclusion is derived. An example for a rule is the following stable (Trace,SAlpha,S,T1,T2,Value1) & incr peak (Trace,SAlpha,S,T2,T3,Value2) & stable (Trace,SAlpha,S,T3,T4,Value3) ! s jump (Trace,S,T1,T4,parallel).

Within the representation formalism, the representation language for our application has to be declared. MOBAL supports the declaration of predicates or acquires the declarations automatically. We have developed a hierarchy of predicates. The lowest level is given by the measure predicate.

Reference-contexts: Each learned feature is represented by several clauses. Our application of RDT differs from the heuristic relational learner FOIL <ref> [Quinlan, 1990] </ref> in that RDT is capable of learning many rules in one run. FOIL selects the best covering and discriminating rule. In our navigation application, however, we want as many rules as possible that could match a new situation.

Reference-contexts: sensor number, 11 is the starting point, 26 the end point of the time interval, and diagonal is the orientation of the robot towards the sensed edge. 2 MOBAL is developed at the German National Research Center for Computer Science. 3 Formal properties of the formalism have been proved in <ref> [Wrobel, 1987] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This loop goes on forever. If appropriate ways of calculating features are available, the appropriate degree of granularity of the features should be learned. A similar idea was proposed by Wrobel as an answer to symbol grounding problems <ref> [Wrobel, 1991] </ref>. In Wrobel's paper, however, learning features from sensory data was modeled as a direct segmentation task of a stream of real-valued sensory input.
