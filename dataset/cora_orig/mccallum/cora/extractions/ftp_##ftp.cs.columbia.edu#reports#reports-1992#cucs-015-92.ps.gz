Abstract: In this paper we propose and demonstrate a simple method for navigation in a large unstructured environment that contains featureless objects, which uses "isolated" landmarks in the navigator's view. The map-maker and navigator are implemented using an IBM 7575 SCARA robot arm, the PIPE (Pipelined Image Processing Engine), and two cameras. The navigational environment consists of a flat plane with spherical objects populated randomly on it. First, the map-maker model observes the environment, given a starting position and a goal position, and it generates a "custom map" that describes describes "how" to get from the starting position to the goal position. The accuracy and the efficiency of the directional instructions are then demonstrated by the navigator by following the commands in the "custom map". This is a first step towards our eventual goal, which is to develop a full set of vocabulary that can qualitatively "describe" the navigational environment to direct the navigator with efficiency and accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Once the objects have been divided into clusters, the next stage can describe the individual clusters. Known methods for describing individual clusters, or dot patterns or dot figures, include external shape description method in [EKS83], internal shape description method in [Rad88] [Tou88], and fuzzy logic classification in <ref> [Abe91] </ref>. Here, we introduce some of the basic vocabulary that we have so far developed as part of our description language. An object is defined to be obvious, if it is the only other object that is visible except for the reference landmark.

Reference-contexts: The two assumptions of the objects that they are uniform in size, and that they are placed randomly bring up some important issues that were not present in our earlier project with the dots world <ref> [KPY90] </ref>. Firstly, an object can no longer be described by its intrinsic attributes, such as shape, size, or color (compared to this, our earlier project had 511 distinctly shaped objects).

Reference-contexts: One of the earliest work done on robot navigation based on human psychology in spatial reasoning was by Kuipers <ref> [Kui78] </ref>. He adopted the concept of "cognitive map" in which the spatial knowledge is divided into a hierarchy of four levels, namely, "sensorimotor", "procedural", "topological", and "metrical".

Reference-contexts: Empty space, distance, and object extent are ignored. Actually, these can be and are considered in the cost matrix by the map-maker. The data structures used in this level of abstraction are parkways and trajectories <ref> [Par91a] </ref>. The custom map The next level of abstraction occurs when the map-maker communicates (one-way, one-time) with the navigator in the form of a sequence: this is, by some criterion, the best "custom map"of visual landmarks, ordered by sequence of traversal.

Reference-contexts: The idea of giving directions in terms of "sensorimotor" or "procedural" information is supported by the result of the investigation by Streeter et al. <ref> [SVW85] </ref>. They performed an experiment on a group of people to compare the effectiveness of four different types of navigational aids: vocal instructions, simplified maps, both together, and commercial maps. The result revealed the superiority of vocal instructions over the other three methods. <p> Sensory range is limited, to a relatively small area of the world (view window), and there is virtually no memory. However, this is an actual advantage; usually, the less that needs to be sensed or remembered the better, since the cognitive load of the navigator is minimized <ref> [SVW85] </ref>. Although more intelligent navigators can be modeled, this one chooses to ignore most of the world and its features for the sake of efficient traversal. Formally, the custom map can is represented in the form: (D; M ) fl .
