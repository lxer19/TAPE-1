Reference-contexts: A simple theory and practice for implementing switching circuits based on adiabatic charging has been developed and demonstrated through a number of small chip building experiments. Our experiments with adiabatic switching indicate that significant amounts of circuit energy can be conserved in CMOS circuits <ref> [1] </ref>; and that when these circuits are operated reversibly, they can potentially be a practical approach to low-power computing. <p> This switching mode precludes the set-hold-reset paradigm described in Section 2 for the reversible pipeline constructions. To solve this problem, a switch may be inserted into the resonant circuit so that the sinusoidal outputs can be stopped at maximum and minimum voltage <ref> [1] </ref>. The circuit of Figure 3 can be used for this purpose, is representative of the problems to be encountered in general, and is E diss x RC -CV 2 = x 8 R load. Power supply to the left of the dotted line. <p> Assume that the switch is driven by a conventional driver, i.e., all the energy stored on the gate capacitance is dissipated every cycle. For small drain-to-source voltages and with a fixed source voltage of , the on-resistance of the switch can be modelled as <ref> [1] </ref>: When the A switch is made wider, its gate capacitance will increase, reducing the on-resistance and thereby the dissipation in its channel; on the other hand, the increased gate capacitance requires more energy to control the switch. <p> For given values of , , and , there is an optimum switch device width that minimizes the total dissipation. The optimum width, as well as the corresponding minimum total energy, are proportional to the square root of the inverse of the charging time <ref> [1] </ref>. It is in principle possible to decrease the power supply dissipation by using a similar inductor circuit to drive the gate of the switch of the first circuit. <p> dd V th ( ) 2 1 - CV th V th E reversible M 2x RC -CV dd RC -CV dd 2M 1+( ) x T 2 = shaded elements would be needed in a conventional adder with an equal amount of pipelining. cin o [0] a [2] b <ref> [1] </ref> + + + + + + + + + o [1] cout The forward adder is shaded dark grey, the backward adder is shaded medium grey, and the delay wedge is light grey. <p> th E reversible M 2x RC -CV dd RC -CV dd 2M 1+( ) x T 2 = shaded elements would be needed in a conventional adder with an equal amount of pipelining. cin o [0] a [2] b <ref> [1] </ref> + + + + + + + + + o [1] cout The forward adder is shaded dark grey, the backward adder is shaded medium grey, and the delay wedge is light grey.

Reference-contexts: With the gate electrodes driven by complementary voltages ( and 0, respectively), to a first approximation the on-resistance of a T-gate can be modelled as <ref> [3] </ref>: (2) is the channel length, is the mobility of the n-channel device, is the threshold voltage, and is the gate capacitance of the n-channel device. <p> For this eventuality, there is an unavoidable dissipation for erasing the final output [4]. This dissipation is proportional to the number of output signals rather than the total number of signal nodes in the circuit. Adiabatic principles can be applied to reduce this dissipation per output signal from to <ref> [3] </ref>. The four states that each data bit must cycle through can be associated with phases of clock signals. By overlapping several clocks and using them also as the and inputs, it is possible to build a fully static pipeline structure using eight clock phases [9]. <p> The first case is a completely dissipative discharge through a conventional switch connected to ground; all the energy stored on the capacitance is discharged, so the cost is: (6) Second, we may use the information in the bit itself to control its discharge down to <ref> [3] </ref>, and completely dissipate only the remaining energy.

Reference-contexts: This problem is analyzed in detail in Section 3. The second problem is how to perform useful computations with high utilization of VLSI chip resources while also meeting the logical and physical requirements for energy conservation. Towards this goal, many reversible schemes have been proposed <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref>; our variant is described in this section. In Section 4, we examine in detail the logical overhead imposed by this scheme. and building adiabatic-switching circuits. With this scheme, a clock signal (labelled ) is used to both power and sequence the circuit functions. <p> Logic functions may be composed by using the charge-up path of the circuit in Figure 1 as a single logic stage and then connecting the outputs of one stage to the inputs of the next in a cascaded fashion <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> In practice, there will usually be a final output stage in which the operation of the circuit is no longer reversible. For this eventuality, there is an unavoidable dissipation for erasing the final output <ref> [4] </ref>. This dissipation is proportional to the number of output signals rather than the total number of signal nodes in the circuit. Adiabatic principles can be applied to reduce this dissipation per output signal from to [3].

Energy dissipation is unavoidable when information irrevocably leaves the system <ref> [6] </ref>. We may, of course, decide to throw away information not only at the periphery of the system, but also at other places in the computation. Typically, this will allow us to remove bit delay elements, since at least the thrown-away signal will not be kept for later uncomputation.

Reference-contexts: The unlabelled switch boxes are each a single T-gate. The labelled boxes compute functions as a series-parallel network of one or more T-gates. All AND-OR Boolean expressions can be implemented via such series-parallel connections of switches <ref> [7] </ref>. All functions are computed in dual-rail form so that the NOT function is trivially provided for. The inputs and and the T-gates that they control guard against the possibility of non-adiabatic energy ow when the data value and the clock value are both at valid but different logic levels.

Reference-contexts: Each signal is computed by two functions: one taking its inputs from the preceding stage of computation and one using data from the following stage. When the pipeline is operated, each data bit is cycled through four states: set, hold, reset, and idle <ref> [8] </ref>. Set and reset correspond to the delivery and return of the signal energy, while hold overlaps with the set state of the following stage and the reset state of the preceding stage. The idle state is included for symmetry as a place-holder between the reset and set states.

Reference-contexts: The four states that each data bit must cycle through can be associated with phases of clock signals. By overlapping several clocks and using them also as the and inputs, it is possible to build a fully static pipeline structure using eight clock phases <ref> [9] </ref>. In some cases, it is possible to use fewer phases, e.g., four or six, depending on the function and the need for static logic. This pipeline structure has been demonstrated in three chip designs: a shift register, a bit-level pipelined parity generator, and a pipelined adder.

Reference-contexts: A capacitance can be driven with a sinusoidal signal with high efficiency, using any of a variety of well-known techniques for LC oscillator design <ref> [10] </ref>. Figure 4 shows a conceptual circuit exemplifying this technique; Figure 5 shows the corresponding waveforms of the sine-wave generators and the output. The frequency of the gate-drive waveform is two-thirds E min T 1 2 N ( ) ~ T 1 for adiabatic switching.

Reference-contexts: The efficiency of the solutions for these problems must be compared not against themselves but rather against the best solution which can be achieved by the more well-known approaches to reducing power dissipation, most notably by scaling down the supply voltage of a conventional CMOS logic circuit <ref> [11] </ref>. 3: Controlling the Power Supply The constant-current case for energy delivery described by Equation 1 requires that the power supply generate linear voltage ramps. Unfortunately, we do not know how to deliver and recover energy at constant current without dissipating more energy than is recycled in the regenerator. <p> To compare the second and third cases, we relate to by observing that there is an optimally energy-efficient supply voltage for T-gate-based adiabatic circuits, which can be approximated as four times the threshold voltage <ref> [11] </ref>. Then, with : (11) A fully-reversible case with bit delay elements dissipates less energy if , or: (12) Here, a ten-bit delay overhead ( ) would require the charging period to be almost .

Reference-contexts: the reversible adder was also extracted and SPICE-simulated to get an estimate of the constant used in the calculations in this section; the use of dual-rail logic and guard switches as in Figure 1 and the routing capacitances, etc., force this constant beyond (which equals in the well-known tau model <ref> [12] </ref>). In summary, for a fully-reversible, adiabatic, bit-pipelined four-bit adder to exhibit lower dissipation than two interconnected two-bit adders with the energy of the non-reversed carry bit completely dissipated, the switching time has to be increased to at least .
