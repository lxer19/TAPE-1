Abstract: We propose a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design builds on a previously designed control architecture that works under normal conditions of operation. The faults that are considered in our design are classified according to the capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. Information about these capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the extended control strategies that are needed by these supervisors in each layer of the hierarchy and, in certain cases, give examples of their detailed operation. A companion paper develops and verifies protocols for extended coordination strategies and maneuvers.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the sensor structure has already been designed for the normal mode (see for example <ref> [Alag et al.1994] </ref>). 2.2.3 Control Structure To complete the design we need to specify a controller hierarchy. The closed loop system will then look like Figure 2. The autonomy requirement forces us to make an explicit distinction between strategic planning and control execution. <p> The capability can be enhanced by using multiple redundant sensors along with sensor fusion. Sensor fusion schemes for AHS are discussed in detail in <ref> [Alag et al.1994] </ref>. We also assume that fault detection methods exist on the vehicle and the infrastructure which together with the sensor fusion methods, appropriately fill out the capability vector of the physical layer. <p> In the control design, topmost priority should be given to the safety of the vehicles. However, there can be many designs satisfying a given safety requirement, which differ in the other 8 See <ref> [Alag et al.1994] </ref> for fault detection and sensor fusion details 9 Note that normal mode strategy will no longer be possible due to the fault, unless the fault belongs to the category "vehicle does not need to get out". 10 See [Godbole et al.1995a] for a detailed discussion on priorities among

For activity 20 and work based models (like the ones in <ref> [Hall1993, Broucke and Varaiya1995] </ref>) description in terms of a desired distribution of activities may be more suitable.

Reference-contexts: Asymptotic tracking of the desired profiles is proved by Lyapunov analysis, assuming a flow model for the traffic. The performance of the regulator is currently being investigated on the SmartPath <ref> [Eskafi et al.1994] </ref> simulation platform. 5.2 Coordination Layer 5.2.1 Overview Similar to the link layer, the coordination layer consists of a two level control structure (Figure 8). The supervisor level determines the sequence of maneuvers (strategy) that a vehicle should carry out. <p> In other words, simulation results can not be taken as proof that a system works well in general but they can be taken as proof that it works in specific cases, or, more importantly, that it doesn't work in others. The AHS simulator SmartPath <ref> [Eskafi et al.1994] </ref> has been used successfully in the past to identify shortcomings of the hybrid system and improve the design [Godbole et al.1995c]. We are currently extending the capabilities of SmartPath to include working under degraded modes of operations.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the applicability of a regulation layer controller can be modeled by a predicate whose value depends on the values of the predicates for the physical layer. Consider, for example, the Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Controller proposed in <ref> [Godbole and Lygeros1994] </ref> as the default longitudinal law for the leader of a platoon. This longitudinal control law uses sensor readings of velocity and acceleration of the vehicle, and of the spacing and relative velocity with respect to the preceding vehicle to calculate inputs for the throttle and brake actuators. <p> F I : f0; 1g n long +n lat ! f0; 1g n man For the normal maneuvers presented in [Hsu et al.1994, Godbole et al.1995b] and the control laws of <ref> [Peng and Tomizuka1990, Sheikholeslam and Desoer1990, Godbole and Lygeros1994] </ref>, [Godbole et al.1995b, Chee and Tomizuka1994, Frankel et al.1995], the map F I can be seen in Figure 4. 3.1.4 Coordination Layer Supervisor Predicates In order to operate normally, the coordination layer of [Hsu et al.1994] requires the vehicle to be able <p> If the limits on P 1 P are violated, the join/split/change lane trajectories used in the regulation layer design <ref> [Godbole and Lygeros1994] </ref> should be recalculated to accommodate for the reduced acceleration capability. Different limits for aborting the maneuvers should be set in the interface of [Lygeros and Godbole1994]. 2. If the limits on P 2 P are violated similar measures should be taken. <p> The normal mode regulation supervisor designed in [Lygeros and Godbole1994] act as an interface between the coordination layer design of [Hsu et al.1994] and the regulation layer control laws of <ref> [Godbole and Lygeros1994] </ref>. The supervisor brings together discrete event and continuous dynamical systems to form a hybrid system. Unfortunately there is no systematic way of verifying the complete hybrid system at this time. <p> This proof will suffice to guarantee safety of vehicles if the continuous dynamics can be designed to obey the abstractions. From past experience <ref> [Godbole and Lygeros1994, Lygeros and Godbole1994, Godbole et al.1995c] </ref> it is clear that the regulation layer control laws can not be designed to satisfy such abstractions in presence of a wide variety of disturbances.

Reference-contexts: The maneuvers FS and ELC are variations of the normal mode maneuvers split and lane change. Due to space limitations, we do not describe these maneuvers and strategies in detail. Design and verification of the extended coordination layer controller is presented in the companion paper <ref> [Godbole et al.1995a] </ref>. 5.3 Regulation Layer 5.3.1 Overview The regulation layer also consists a supervisor and a regulator level. The regulator consists of a set of continuous feedback controllers for each task defined by the coordination layer. <p> safety requirement, which differ in the other 8 See [Alag et al.1994] for fault detection and sensor fusion details 9 Note that normal mode strategy will no longer be possible due to the fault, unless the fault belongs to the category "vehicle does not need to get out". 10 See <ref> [Godbole et al.1995a] </ref> for a detailed discussion on priorities among different strategies. 11 The size of the "neighborhood "depends on the type of fault [Godbole et al.1995a]. 25 two criteria. <p> strategy will no longer be possible due to the fault, unless the fault belongs to the category "vehicle does not need to get out". 10 See <ref> [Godbole et al.1995a] </ref> for a detailed discussion on priorities among different strategies. 11 The size of the "neighborhood "depends on the type of fault [Godbole et al.1995a]. 25 two criteria. For example consider the following solution to the degraded mode control design problem: A faulty vehicle always stops on the highway regardless of the type of fault. <p> This is a topic of further research. 6.2 Verification Issues After designing the control laws in this framework, the extended architecture has to be verified before implementation. The extended coordination layer control laws have been verified to be deadlock free, live and fair <ref> [Godbole et al.1995a] </ref>. <p> Proving system safety will involve the hybrid system resulting from the interactions of the coordination and the regulation layer. From our past experience, it seems plausible that for our framework (and the coordination layer of <ref> [Godbole et al.1995a] </ref>), suitable regulation layer controllers can be designed to satisfy the safety requirement. 26 continuous state of each vehicle at every instant of time is in the region of attraction (safe set) of the regulation layer control law that the vehicle is applying. <p> We proposed a design for the coordination layer and gave requirements for the link and regulation layer controllers.The assumption our design makes about the physical layer were also stated. The complete coordination layer design, together with verification results is given in the companion paper <ref> [Godbole et al.1995a] </ref>. Work is already underway for a link layer design compatible with our framework, both for the planning [Broucke and Varaiya1995] and the regulator [Li et al.1995] levels. The modifications to the regulation layer design are also the subject of ongoing research.

Reference-contexts: The design of the supervisor induces a mapping between the capability vectors of the regulation layer and its supervisor.

These faults are resolved by simple additional strategies that do not interfere with the rest of the design (see <ref> [Godbole et al.1995b] </ref> for details). It should be noted that, even if the list in the appendix is not exhaustive, any additional faults we come up with can be uniquely classified using this scheme. Moreover combinations of faults can also be classified similarly. <p> Such an approach is used for changing lane from the transition lane to the automated lane in the entry maneuver design of <ref> [Godbole et al.1995b] </ref>. In this case, the lane change is assisted by roadside sensors allowing on-board vehicle lateral sensors to have a reasonably small range. 24 6 Discussion & Further Issues The overall fault tolerant control architecture can be described with the help of Figure 21.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, the law proposed in <ref> [Hedrick et al.1991] </ref> for the followers in a platoon makes use of additional information about the state of the leader of the platoon. It is assumed that this information is transmitted to all the followers using an infrared communication link. <p> The coordination layer protocols need inter-vehicle communication capability that ranges over at least the sensor range on the front and the rear of the vehicle and spanning across two lanes on either side. The follower control laws of <ref> [Hedrick et al.1991] </ref> need infrared communication link to transmit the acceleration of the lead vehicle of the platoon.

Reference-contexts: The definition of "normal" may vary from case to case, but, in general, it means benign environmental conditions and faultless operation of all the hardware, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. Some studies to deal with "abnormal" conditions have been made (for example <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994, Tomizuka et al.1994, Hitchcock1994] </ref>), but they are mostly concerned with specific faults rather than a general framework. Our goal is to propose an AHS design that will perform well under almost any condition.

Reference-contexts: The current design <ref> [Hsu et al.1994] </ref> uses protocols, in the form of finite state machines, to organize the maneuvers in a systematic way. They receive the commands of the link layer and aggregated sensor 2 information from the individual vehicles (of the form "there is a vehicle in the adjacent lane"). <p> The design of the supervisor induces a mapping between the capability vectors of the regulation layer and its supervisor.

The supervisor brings together discrete event and continuous dynamical systems to form a hybrid system. Unfortunately there is no systematic way of verifying the complete hybrid system at this time.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted here that the description of the strategy need not be in terms of density and velocity profiles. Such profiles are better suited if flow traffic models, such as the ones in <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994, Li et al.1995] </ref>, are used. For activity 20 and work based models (like the ones in [Hall1993, Broucke and Varaiya1995]) description in terms of a desired distribution of activities may be more suitable. <p> Such differences will be taken care of by an appropriate design of a link-coordination layer interface. The regulator should monitor the traffic in the link and use feedback to guarantee that the desired strategy is tracked by the closed loop system. A possible regulator design is presented in <ref> [Li et al.1995] </ref>. The design accepts as inputs velocity and density profiles and issues velocity commands to the vehicles (both longitudinal and lateral). Asymptotic tracking of the desired profiles is proved by Lyapunov analysis, assuming a flow model for the traffic. <p> The complete coordination layer design, together with verification results is given in the companion paper [Godbole et al.1995a].

The modifications to the regulation layer design are also the subject of ongoing research. Our design raises important issues for both automated highway systems and hierarchical control in general.

Reference-contexts: If the limits on P 1 P are violated, the join/split/change lane trajectories used in the regulation layer design [Godbole and Lygeros1994] should be recalculated to accommodate for the reduced acceleration capability. Different limits for aborting the maneuvers should be set in the interface of <ref> [Lygeros and Godbole1994] </ref>. 2. If the limits on P 2 P are violated similar measures should be taken. In addition the headway (inter-platoon distance) should be increased and/or the desired speed should be reduced. <p> We briefly describe the functional requirements of the extended regulation layer below. A detailed design of the extended regulation layer is a current research area. 5.3.2 Supervisor The normal mode regulation supervisor (Figure 19), originally designed in <ref> [Lygeros and Godbole1994] </ref>, is a finite state machine whose transitions depend upon the commands from the coordination layer, the readings of the sensors (physical layer responses) and the state of the continuous controllers. It 22 plays a dual role. <p> If, at any stage, the maneuver becomes hazardous it aborts it, notifies the coordination layer of its decision (symbol) and switches to a different continuous control law that will get the system back to a safe configuration.

Some studies to deal with "abnormal" conditions have been made (for example <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994, Tomizuka et al.1994, Hitchcock1994] </ref>), but they are mostly concerned with specific faults rather than a general framework. Our goal is to propose an AHS design that will perform well under almost any condition. <p> A possible design for the link layer is described in <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994] </ref>. It is based on a traffic flow model similar to the ones developed for manual traffic. The next level in the hierarchy below the link layer is the coordination layer. <p> For autonomous operation we would like the system to be able to deal with a wide range of conditions, significantly wider than the range of robustness of the normal mode controllers. Some laws also exist for operation under severely degraded conditions. For example, <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994] </ref> contains a link layer control law to divert traffic when a lane is blocked (because of an accident for example) and [Tomizuka et al.1994] describes a regulation layer control law for steering in case of a tire burst. <p> The part of F C dealing with normal operation is shown in Figure 5. Similar maps for the strategies introduced to deal with degraded conditions of operation can be constructed. 3.1.5 Link Layer Supervisor Predicates As discussed in the introduction, the link layer design of <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994] </ref> makes use of information about the density and average velocity of traffic in a link and traffic flow in the downstream links to come up with control inputs that maximize the throughput of the highway. <p> It should be noted here that the description of the strategy need not be in terms of density and velocity profiles. Such profiles are better suited if flow traffic models, such as the ones in <ref> [Rao and Varaiya1994, Li et al.1995] </ref>, are used. For activity 20 and work based models (like the ones in [Hall1993, Broucke and Varaiya1995]) description in terms of a desired distribution of activities may be more suitable.

Reference-contexts: The framework will partition the task into more manageable segments and formalize the requirements that each of them will need to satisfy. 1.1 Overview of Normal Mode Architecture Our framework builds on the control architecture proposed in <ref> [Varaiya1993] </ref> for normal modes of operation. Before presenting the framework for fault handling and recovery, we give a brief overview of the normal mode design to fix the terminology and notation. <p> The central concept of the architecture is that the AHS control problem is too large to be dealt with by means of a single controller. Therefore a hierarchical control structure is introduced. The design of the control hierarchy outlined in <ref> [Varaiya1993] </ref> centers around the notion of "platooning". It is assumed that traffic on the highway is organized in groups of tightly spaced vehicles, called platoons. <p> Clearly implementation of such a scheme will require automatic control of vehicles, as human drivers are not fast and reliable enough to produce the kinds of inputs necessary for forming platoons. In the architecture outlined in <ref> [Varaiya1993] </ref> the system is organized in five layers (Fig-ure 1). The top layer, called the network layer, is responsible for the flow of traffic on the entire highway system 2 . <p> The new architecture will be a qualitative as well as a quantitative extension of the normal mode architecture. Qualitatively, the degraded mode architecture maintains the hierarchical structure introduced in <ref> [Varaiya1993] </ref> but it increases the autonomy of the system. This is achieved by adding to the design the capability to detect faults, decide on a new control strategy and execute it. <p> It should be noted that many iterations between steps 4 and 6 may be needed before a satisfactory design is obtained. 6 3 Modeling Capability 3.1 Capability Structure The control scheme for normal operating conditions presented in <ref> [Varaiya1993] </ref> relies on a number of sensors, actuators and communication devices, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. All this additional hardware as well as the standard mechanical parts of the vehicles are prone to failure. <p> Our framework is hierarchical and builds on the control architecture of <ref> [Varaiya1993] </ref>. The design provides a high degree of autonomy by extending the information structure to include data about the system capability and the control structure to make a distinction between strategic planning and execution. Our framework now needs to be filled in with appropriate control laws.
