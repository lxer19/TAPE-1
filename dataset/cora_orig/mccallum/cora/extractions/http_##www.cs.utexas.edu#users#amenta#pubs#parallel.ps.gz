Abstract: R d can be divided into a union of parallel (dk)-flats of the form x 1 = g 1 ; x 2 = g 2 ; : : : x k = g k , where the g i are constant. Let C be a family of parallel (d k)-dimensional convex sets, meaning that each is contained in one of the above parallel (d k)-flats. We give a parameterization of the set of k-flats in R d , such that the set of k-flats which intersect, in a point, any set c 2 C, is convex. Parameterizing the lines in R 3 through horizontal convex sets as convex sets has applications to medical imaging, and interesting connections with recent work on light field rendering in computer graphics. The general case is useful for fitting k-flats to points in R d . The following easy reduction is well known. Let C be a finite set of parallel line segments in R d . We want to find a (d 1)-transversal for C, that is, a hyperplane intersecting every segment in C. Such a hyperplane has to pass below the upper endpoint of each segment and above the lower endpoint. In the dual, the endpoints correspond to linear halfspaces, and the intersection of these halfspaces corresponds to the set of hyperplane transversals of the parallel segments in the primal. So the problem is solved by linear programming in dimension d, in linear time if d is fixed. Here, we give the appropriate generalization of this observation for k-transversals, for 1 k &lt; d. A k-transversal of a family of sets C is a k-flat (that is, a k-dimensional affine subspace) intersecting every set in C. Figure 1 shows the case k = 1; d = 3.

Reference-contexts: Any convex function on the space of k-flats can be used as the objective function for the convex program in Theorem 3.2, most conveniently a linear function.

Reference-contexts: The set of acceptable 5 paths corresponds to a union of cells in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement in the four--dimensional space of lines. Each cell in this arrangement is a subset of lines. The arrangement can be constructed by random sampling <ref> [C87] </ref>. We select a constant size random sample of the parallel polygons, construct the arrangement induced by their edges in the space of lines, and subdivide each cell of this arrangement into simplices.

Reference-contexts: Helly's theorem together with Theorem 2.2 implies Theorem 1.1. There are many Helly-type theorems about hyperplane transversals, and some about line transversals (see <ref> [GPW93] </ref>), but this is the first theorem giving a finite Helly number for k-transversals for all 1 k &lt; d for some family of sets.

Reference-contexts: Goodman and Pollack define the convex sets in a Grassmanian as the sets of k-transversals of convex sets in R d <ref> [GP94] </ref>. They show that this definition is a generalization of convexity, in some senses, but, for instance, convex set under their definition can have multiple connected components. We exhibit subsets of the Grassmanian which are convex in the usual sense.

Reference-contexts: We exhibit subsets of the Grassmanian which are convex in the usual sense. The special case of Theorem 1.1 for k = 1; d = 3, was given by Grunbaum <ref> [G60] </ref>, which suggested our approach. One immediate algorithmic consequence of Theorem 2.2 is that a k-transversal of a finite set C of parallel (d k)-dimensional sets, if one exists, can be found by a convex program in dimension (k + 1)(d k), in linear expected time if d is constant.

Reference-contexts: This subdivision is interesting for volume visualization and, as we discuss below, for path planning for lasers, needles or other invasive linear elements. Our parameterization is also used in computer graphics in a recent paper by Hanrahan and Levoy on light field rendering <ref> [HL96] </ref>, in which an object is represented by the radiance on the 2 directed lines incident to it. A light field is a hyper-rectangular set of lines including those incident to the object.
