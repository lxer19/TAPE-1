Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Statistical analyses of measurements of communication traffic from a wide variety of sources have suggested that correlations persist in such sources over fairly long time scales; for examples of such measurements, see <ref> [3] </ref>, [16], and [21]. This has called into question the use of traditional traffic models for the performance analysis of communication networks, and has sparked considerable research on the use of "long-range dependent" traffic models for performance analysis; for examples see [1], [2], [14], [17], [19], and [20]. <p> Recent works that sound this note of caution include [12] and [25]. Whatever side the coin may fall on in this controversy, the measurements and statistical analyses of works such as <ref> [3] </ref>, [16], and [21] are fascinating, and beg for some kind of physical explanation, whether it be due to trends, the nature of the underlying protocols, or the existence of "true" "long-range dependence".

Reference-contexts: For instance, the analysis of the Ethernet measurements in [16] is primarily done using the R/S statistic, variance-time plots, and the peri-odogram. The R/S statistic can be highly sensitive to trends in the observations; for instance, a special case of the main result of <ref> [4] </ref> is that the sum of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of random variables with finite mean and variance and a deterministic trend that is vanishingly small and goes to zero asymptotically in time according to a power law, can result in the appearance of a nontrivial (not equal <p> finite mean and variance and a deterministic trend that is vanishingly small and goes to zero asymptotically in time according to a power law, can result in the appearance of a nontrivial (not equal to 1=2) Hurst exponent when analyzed using the R/S statistic (for a precise formal theorem, see <ref> [4] </ref>). The behavior of variance-time plots for the Bellcore measurements of [16] under different kinds of nonstationarity is discussed in [8], and also in [23] (in the latter it is concluded that the measurements support the the hypothesis of long-range dependence fairly well).

Reference-contexts: The traffic source is modeled as having an activity level that depends on the current state. Let us first remark that if X is allowed to be sufficient general, the restriction to deterministic S is not a big one. Indeed, the theory of deterministic chaos, see for instance <ref> [5] </ref> or [15], tells us that quite complicated statistical behavior can be expressed by such deterministic maps. <p> For details regarding the sense in which convergence takes place, and situations in which it is know to take place, see <ref> [5] </ref> and [15]. There is a vast literature this topice, with conditions known that cover several nonlinear maps with quite nontrivial behavior. For maps of the unit interval [0; 1], for instance, a commonly cited example of such a result is recorded in Theorem 6.2.1 of [15]. <p> Except for the quibble that a state of the Markov chain may lead to another state of the chain with probability 1, which situation can also be easily handled, this is an example of a piecewise linear (expanding) Markov transformation, in the sense of Chapter 9 of <ref> [5] </ref>, because the slopes are all strictly bigger than 1; it is easily seen to leave Lebesgue measure invariant (so the invariant density is 1). <p> Our second remark is the following : Suppose we are given any piecewise expanding transformation of the interval (for the definition, see page 85 of <ref> [5] </ref>). These are among the most studied transformations in the literature, and for maps of the interval an expanding condition is required for most results regarding the existence of a stationary distribution. 1 Then one can approximate the transformation by a piecewise linear (expanding) Markov transformation.

Reference-contexts: We now proceed to make a couple of remarks about the queueing behavior of queues driven by such traffic models. 3 Large deviations We first record a special case of a result of <ref> [6] </ref>, see Thm 3.9 (ii) of that paper. Let fa n ; n 0g be a stationary and ergodic sequence of nonnegative real valued random variables, interpreted as the sequence of arrivals into a single server queue, which can serve an amount c per unit time. <p> Let q 1 be a random variable with this distribution. We assume that for any , 0 &lt; &lt; 1, the limit a fl () = n P n1 exists. Let us define fl = supf : a fl () &lt; cg : Then the claim of <ref> [6] </ref> is that we have lim log P (q 1 u) = fl : In this result, note that, since fl &gt; 0, the tail probability of the stationary queue size decreases exponentially. <p> This is a basic result that goes back to the seminal works of Donsker and Varadhan for the large deviations of the empirical distribution of Markov processes; for a convenient reference for such results, see [9]. Thus, according to the result of <ref> [6] </ref>, the tail probabilities of a single server queue driven by such an arrival process will decay exponentially (assuming stability), and the rate of decay of the tail can be explicitly computed in terms of the parameters of the approximating Markov transformation.

Reference-contexts: In this note our purpose is to make a couple of remarks in connection with another intriguing idea for arriving at physical descriptions of network communication traffic, suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>. 2 Deterministic dynamical systems The proposal in [10] is to model a communication traffic source (such as an Ethernet LAN, or a VBR video source) by means of a deterministic nonlinear transformation x n+1 = S (x n ), taking values in some state space X. <p> In this note our purpose is to make a couple of remarks in connection with another intriguing idea for arriving at physical descriptions of network communication traffic, suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>. 2 Deterministic dynamical systems The proposal in [10] is to model a communication traffic source (such as an Ethernet LAN, or a VBR video source) by means of a deterministic nonlinear transformation x n+1 = S (x n ), taking values in some state space X. <p> Another argument for the potential interest in such deterministic models is that there appears to be a significant amount of determinism in the structure of communication traffic in Fig 1. of <ref> [10] </ref> the successive interarrival times from the Ethernet measurements of [16] is plotted, and visual inspection shows what appears to be considerable deterministic structure in this plot. <p> Further, by chosing suitable approximations for the transformation describing the system, we can write explicit formulas for the rate of decay of the tail probabilities of the stationary queue size. 1 The models proposed in <ref> [10] </ref> are also of this type, although the focus there is on conjectures regarding the situation corresponding to "intermittency" in physics, where the expanding condition fails to hold at one point. 6 Appendix Let X 1 ; : : : ; X N be a sequence of conditionally independent Poisson random

Reference-contexts: The persistence of long-range dependence in packet traffic even after it is regulated by simple flow control schemes fl Research supported by NSF NCR 9422513. is demonstrated in <ref> [24] </ref>. A bibliography of work in this area as of the middle of 1996 is available in [26]. It should be pointed out that this area is quite active, and the jury is still out on the interpretation and significance of these results.

Reference-contexts: This brings us to the second ground for caution, which is whether traditional traffic models with sufficiently large depth of correlation might already serve adequately for buffer dimensioning and network design purposes. Recent works that sound this note of caution include [12] and <ref> [25] </ref>.

A bibliography of work in this area as of the middle of 1996 is available in <ref> [26] </ref>. It should be pointed out that this area is quite active, and the jury is still out on the interpretation and significance of these results. There are at least two general grounds for caution.

Reference-contexts: At least, such a physical understanding would aid in the construction of parsimonious and realistic traffic models, be they "traditional" or "long-range-dependent". One attempt at such a physical explanation is in <ref> [27] </ref>, where it is argued via statistical analysis of the measurements in [16] that they are consistent with infinite variance of the load at the level of individual sources.
