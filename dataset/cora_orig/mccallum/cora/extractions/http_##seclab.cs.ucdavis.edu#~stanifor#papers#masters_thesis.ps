Reference-contexts: For next-neighbor thumbprints, the substrate will be <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. For pairs separated by four intervening characters, it will be [0; 5]. We now define the degree of a thumbprint to be the cardinality of the substrate. Thus single character thumbprints have degree 1, while pair based thumbprints have degree 2. <p> For example, if A is the set of lower case letters of the alphabet, and the substrate is <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then we can characterize the sequence, as far as any possible thumbprint function is concerned, by counting the number of times aa occurs in the sequence, the number of times ab occurs, and so on. <p> This is obvious for completely random sequences, but not quite so obvious for human or computer generated ones. 30 Next come a pair of figures which are the analog of Figure 4.3 for other substrates. In Figures 4.4 and 4.5, 2;1 the distance for a substrate of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (pairs of successive characters), is contrasted with 2;i , (pair of characters at separation i), for various i. The first, perhaps rather surprising, inference that can be drawn from these figures is that, when comparing by counting character pairs, the separation of the pairs makes almost no difference. <p> More importantly, under the null hypothesis that C and C 0 are independently and randomly chosen connections, the p t are random variables drawn from a uniform distribution on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Thus when we take their product, the result is drawn from the distribution of the product of s U (0; 1) distributions. <p> The histogram of the obtained values of l pair is shown in Figure 6.2 as the dotted line. The solid line is the curve that would apply if successive values of p t were inde 52 pendent so that p pair was distributed uniformly on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Clearly (as expected) this assumption is violated and thus comparisons between unrelated connections tend to be more significant than this assumption would allow. However, it is not so grossly wrong as to make us abandon the natural comparison suggested in and immediately after equation (4.15).

Reference-contexts: For example, consider the vector of character counts N = [N x ], where each component N x represents the number of times the character combination x occurs in the sequence to be thumbprinted. For example, if the substrate was <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, then N aa would be the number of times that an a in the input was followed after one arbitrary intervening character by another a.

Reference-contexts: For next-neighbor thumbprints, the substrate will be [0; 1]. For pairs separated by four intervening characters, it will be <ref> [0; 5] </ref>. We now define the degree of a thumbprint to be the cardinality of the substrate. Thus single character thumbprints have degree 1, while pair based thumbprints have degree 2. Now any given term in the sum that forms the thumbprint depends on characters.
