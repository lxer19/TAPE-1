Reference-contexts: 1 Abstract The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to speed program execution up. FPGAs implement arbitrary circuits and have been highly successful at exploiting bit-level parallelism in applications such as image processing <ref> [splash2] </ref>. Our work applies this technology towards, Adobe Photoshop, a widely-used image processing package for commodity PCs. 2 Discussion There are two classical approaches in computer architecture.

Reference-contexts: Once the filter has been ported to VHDL, tests will be run on the performance of the filter. These results will be compared with the results from the standard filter and with microprocessor-based PCI accelerators <ref> [DayStar1] </ref>. We expect speedups of ranging from one to two orders of magnitude, depending upon the filter. Such results should make FPGAs substantially more cost-effective than microprocessor add-on cards.

Photoshop also provides a plug-in interface for user-defined filters [adobe-sdk] A commercial system by DayStar Digital, Inc. uses multiprocessors to gain a reported 200% to 300% <ref> [DayStar2] </ref> enhancement with Photo-shop [Adobe] plug-in filters. The cost of these systems range from $4,999 for the low end dual-processor to $9,999 for the high end four-processor system. We can use this interface to write filters which execute upon FPGAs on a PCI card (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Another alternative is integrate the FPGA into DRAM, with nearly the same results. 3 Future Work To prove the feasibility and advantage of this system, Adobe Photoshop filter will be written in C++, and then portions will be transfered to Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL) <ref> [vhdl-cookbook] </ref>. Although synthesis from VHDL to FPGA circuits can be as expen 1 sive as several hours of computation, circuits can be "pre-compiled" and directly loaded on to FPGAs at run-time.
