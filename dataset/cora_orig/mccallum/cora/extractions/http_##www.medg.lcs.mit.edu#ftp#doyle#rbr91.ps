Abstract: Theories of rational belief revision recently proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, Makin-son, and Nebel illuminate many important issues but impose unnecessarily strong standards for correct revisions and make strong assumptions about what information is available to guide revisions. We reconstruct these theories according to an economic standard of rationality in which preferences are used to select among alternative possible revisions. By permitting multiple partial specifications of preferences in ways closely related to preference-based nonmonotonic logics, the reconstructed theory employs information closer to that available in practice and offers more flexible ways of selecting revisions. We formally compare this new conception of rational belief revision with the original theories, adapt results about universal default theories to prove that there is unlikely to be any universal method of rational belief revision, and examine formally how different limitations on rationality affect belief revision.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we examine how irrationalities in preference aggregation lead to violations of the AGM rationality axioms. 2 REVISING BELIEF STATES The AGM formalization of belief revision may be summarized as follows, using an adaptation of the notations of <ref> [ Alchourron et al., 1985 ] </ref> and [ Nebel, 1989 ] .

Reference-contexts: This theory is formally similar to Doyle and Wellman's [ 1991 ] theory of rational default reasoning and to the economic theory of social choice <ref> [ Arrow, 1963 ] </ref> . We prove that no method for belief revision based on partial preferences satisfies all the rationality conditions on preference aggregation. <p> Theorem 4 (Arrow) If the domain includes more than two alternatives, no aggregation policy mapping sets of total preorders to total global preorders satisfies the collective rationality, Pareto, IIA, and nondicta-torship conditions. We omit the proof because, with the restriction to total orders, this is exactly Arrow's theorem <ref> [ Arrow, 1963 ] </ref> . There is no problem finding good aggregation policies for choices among only two alternatives: majority rule works fine, for example. But for the case of belief revision, there are typically several possible alternatives to choose from.

Reference-contexts: These preferences can conflict on cases like that of Nixon, and a preference for more specific rules does not help since "Quaker" and "Republican" are incomparable categories. Indeed, as argued elsewhere <ref> [ Doyle and Wellman, 1991 ] </ref> , other preference criteria can conflict as well, including very specific criteria corresponding to individual default rules. Constructing a global ordering thus means resolving the conflicts among the preference criteria being combined. <p> The principled design of an aggregation policy for partial preference criteria begins with a consideration of properties we think a reasonable policy should exhibit. The properties we propose are analogs of Arrow's [ 1963 ] desiderata for social choice. (See <ref> [ Doyle and Wellman, 1991 ] </ref> for further explanation and justification of these desiderata as principles for reasoning.) 1. Collective rationality. The global order ~ is a function of the individual orders ~ i , which are unrestricted, possibly partial, preorders. 2. Pareto principle (unanimity). <p> But for the case of belief revision, there are typically several possible alternatives to choose from. This means that the following theorem applies to the typical case of belief revision. We omit the proof, which may be found, together with further discussion, in <ref> [ Doyle and Wellman, 1991, Theorem 3 ] </ref> . Theorem 5 (Doyle-Wellman) If the domain includes more than two alternatives, no aggregation policy for partial preference preorders satisfies the collec tive rationality, Pareto, IIA, nondictatorship, and conflict resolution conditions.

Reference-contexts: rationality from the purely logical sense, in which one is rational if one's beliefs are consistent and one's inferences are sound, to the economic sense, in which one is rational if one has a consistent set of preferences and makes choices that are optimal with respect to these preferences (cf. <ref> [ Doyle, 1990 ] </ref> ). This means the theory should use preferences about revisions in guiding revisions, and draw on the standard theory of economic rationality to formalize the notions of rational contraction and revision.

Reference-contexts: Applied to theories, this operation satisfies ( : : but not necessarily ( : : 8) <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988, Lemma 4.1 ] </ref> . <p> contraction does satisfies ( 7) and ( 8) in the case that the choice function C is orderly, that is, if there is some partial ordering v of all subsets of A such that C always chooses an element of A # x that is maximal with respect to v <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988, Lemma 4.3 ] </ref> . <p> However, failure to satisfy ( : : 8) is the least of the problems with maxichoice contraction, for one may prove that using maxichoice contraction to effect the revision A : via (1) makes A : + x a complete theory as long as :x 2 A <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988, Corollary 4.6 ] </ref> . That is, A + x in this case contains either y or :y for each proposition y. <p> defines contraction by A x = S (A # x) if 6` x A otherwise. (5) Partial meet contraction satisfies the basic rationality postulates ( : : 6), and in fact is equivalent to them in the sense that any operation satisfying these axioms is a partial meet contraction operation <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988, Theorem 4.13 ] </ref> . Some partial meet contractions over theories, namely those derived from orderings of theories, are fully rational, satisfying ( : : 8). <p> He also proves that for each transitive relation v there is a transitive total or der v 0 which yields the same contraction function as v <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988, Theorem 4.17 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Space limitations preclude formal elaboration of any of these possibilities. The generality exhibited in the definitions of rational contraction and revision goes against the usual presupposition of epistemologists that knowing more is always better. Indeed, one can even prove that knowing more is better in some standard theories (see <ref> [ Good, 1983 ] </ref> ). But this presupposition (or theorem) is not always justified when holding or revising beliefs have non-epistemological effects, such as incurring computational costs that must be borne by the agent.

Reference-contexts: One can also define contractions in terms of revisions by means of the Harper identity (after <ref> [ Harper, 1976 ] </ref> ) : def : so that the contraction by x is equivalent to taking those beliefs that would be preserved if :x were now believed. 2.2 EPISTEMIC ENTRENCHMENT Though the AGM axioms characterize rational revi sions, Gardenfors [ 1988 ] views the behaviors these axioms describe as

Reference-contexts: First consider epis-temic entrenchment. The maximally preferred states in A # x are just the states in S (A # x). But partial meet contraction makes the new belief state be the intersection of these. In the terminology of inheritance and default reasoning, partial meet contraction is skeptical <ref> [ Horty et al., 1990 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The first main result of their theory is that these postulates for revisions are logically equiva lent to the contraction postulates if the revision A : is defined by means of the Levi identity (after <ref> [ Levi, 1977 ] </ref> ) : def : so that revision by x is equivalent to contracting by :x to remove any inconsistent beliefs and then expanding with x.

Reference-contexts: In the second place, linear epistemic relevance orderings of the propositions in a belief base make belief base contraction easy to implement by simply dropping the lowest ranked propositions in any conflicting set (as in rup <ref> [ McAllester, 1982 ] </ref> ). Moreover, this form of belief base contraction is fully rational, and corresponds to maxichoice contraction on belief bases [ Nebel, 1989, Lemma 17ff ] . Representing epistemic entrenchment, however, can be more costly.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we examine how irrationalities in preference aggregation lead to violations of the AGM rationality axioms. 2 REVISING BELIEF STATES The AGM formalization of belief revision may be summarized as follows, using an adaptation of the notations of [ Alchourron et al., 1985 ] and <ref> [ Nebel, 1989 ] </ref> . In the following we suppose that L is a propositional language over the standard sentential connectives (:, ^, _, !, $), denote individual propositions by x, y, and z, and denote sets of propositions by A, B, and C. <p> By defining the order v B by X v B Y iff X " B 6 Y " B, Nebel proves that partial meet contraction using S B satisfies ( : 7) as well <ref> [ Nebel, 1989, Theorem 15 ] </ref> . Since the order v B is not transitive in general, this definition of contraction need not satisfy ( : These operations depend very strongly on the form of the belief base. <p> Nebel then defines a new selection function S B; in terms of v by S B; (A # x) = and proves <ref> [ Nebel, 1989, Theorem 16 ] </ref> that partial meet contraction defined by this selection function gives rise to a fully rational contraction function sat isfying ( : : If is a linear ordering (no ties allowed), then every finite set of beliefs has a most relevant element, and we may rewrite <p> In this case, v always singles out the greatest element of (B # x), and the partial meet contraction function defined using S B; resembles a maxichoice contraction on the belief base (see <ref> [ Nebel, 1989, Lemma 17 ] </ref> ). Nebel concludes from this that maxichoice contraction on belief bases does not have the undesirable comple tion behavior exhibited by maxichoice contraction of belief states. Moreover, maxichoice base contraction is just as rational as the more complicated base contraction. <p> Moreover, this form of belief base contraction is fully rational, and corresponds to maxichoice contraction on belief bases <ref> [ Nebel, 1989, Lemma 17ff ] </ref> . Representing epistemic entrenchment, however, can be more costly.
