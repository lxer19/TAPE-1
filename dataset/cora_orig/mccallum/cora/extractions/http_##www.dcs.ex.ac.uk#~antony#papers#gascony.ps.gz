Title: A Qualitative Approach to Continuity  
Author: Antony Galton, 
Address: Exeter EX4 4PT, UK.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter,  
Abstract: The standard mathematical treatment of continuity for real-valued functions presupposes a model in which arbitrarily fine distinctions can be drawn between neighbouring states. In a qualitative model these distinctions are obliterated by treating whole ranges of states as qualitatively indistinguishable. In this paper we show how topological considerations can be used, in the form of a relation called `dominance', to handle continuity in discrete qualitative state-spaces derived from an underlying continuous space. A general theorem concerning the composition of such state-spaces is proved, and its potential usefulness illustrated by application to three different areas of spatio-temporal reasoning. Le traitement mathematique normal de la continuite des fonctions aux valeurs reels presuppose un modele dans lequel des distinctions arbitrairement fines peuvent ^etre faites entre les etats avoisinants. Dans un modele qualitatif, ces distinctions sont effacees en considerant une gamme des etats comme qualitativement indistinguibles. Dans cet article, nous montrons comment utiliser les considerations topolo-giques, sous la forme d'une relation que nous appelons la `dominance', afin de traiter la continuite dans les espaces des etats qualitatifs, a condition que ces espaces soient derives d'un espace quantitatif fondamental. Nous demontrons un theoreme general relatif a la composition de tels espaces, et nous eclairons son utilite potentielle par son application a trois domaines du raisonnement spatio-temporel.

Reference-contexts: A simple qualitative description might make use of just three states, namely `left of centre' (L), `at centre' (C), and `right of centre' (R), corresponding to &lt; 0, = 0, and &gt; 0 respectively (cf., <ref> (Davis 1990) </ref>). Clearly (fL; C; Rg; ) is a dominance space, where C L and C R.

Reference-contexts: It may seem strange to view the interval calculus as an example of a dynamical system: intervals cannot change in time, since in some sense they are time! However, our notion of `perturbation' resembles Freksa's notion of conceptual neigh-bourhood <ref> (Freksa 1992) </ref>, which has led to significant advances in our understanding of the Interval Calculus.

Reference-contexts: The primitive temporal elements of our theory will be instants rather than intervals. This has been a somewhat controversial issue in AI, but we shall not attempt to address the issue directly here; the interested reader is referred to <ref> (Galton 1990, Galton 1994, Galton n.d.) </ref>. Here we postulate a set T of temporal elements called instants, endowed with a dense and continuous strictly linear order &lt;, which we may as well assume to be isomorphic to the real numbers under their usual ordering. <p> First, what are the possible patterns of temporal incidence in the qualitative state-space? Which states can hold at isolated instants, and in what contexts? This is what originally motivated the idea of dominance, with the observation that continuity could not be adequately modelled in a pure interval theory of time <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>. Second, how can we determine the neighbourhood relations in complex qualitative state-spaces? Theorem 1 shows how we can determine dominance, and hence neighbourhood, in spaces constructed as products of simpler spaces.

Reference-contexts: diagram; but unlike Freksa, we have derived it using a general theorem for the composition of dominance spaces. &gt;&lt; m o s = si oi mi 3.3 Relations between spatial regions The spatial analogue of Allen's interval calculus is the calculus of spatial relations introduced by Cohn and his associates <ref> (Randell, Cui and Cohn 1992) </ref>. They consider relationships amongst spatial regions, which unlike bodies may overlap or contain each other. <p> The diagram we have produced is exactly what we should expect on the basis of previously published work: essentially the same diagram can be found, without our dominance arrows, in <ref> (Randell et al. 1992) </ref>. Once again, the novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we have derived the diagram by means of the general theorem. The power of our approach can be further illustrated in the context of the RCC-8 calculus as follows.
