Abstract: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) has become an attractive technique for media access control in Personal Communication Networks (PCN). In this paper, two MAC schemes are defined and studied for DS-CDMA PCNs, namely Preamble Signaling Access (PSA) and Min-islot Signaling Access (MSA). PSA uses preamble-packet slot structure while MSA is applying mini-slot techniques to solve the problems of code assignment and MAI control. Markovian chain models have been developed to analyze the performance of these two protocols for voice-only systems as well as data-only systems. The analytical model is shown to be very close to simulation results. Based on the results obtained from the analysis, it is shown that, for many cases, MSA protocol performs better than PSA protocol, especially for voice services. fl Research reported herein was supported in part by U.S. Army Research Office under contract No. DAAL03-92-G-0184, and by Performance Analysis Lab of The Ohio State University.

Reference-contexts: Based on Liu et al's work, Yang et al [16] proposed a MAC protocol which integrates data and voice traffic. 2 Meanwhile, for a long time, there have been many MAC protocols designed for time-division--based mobile communication systems, one of the best known is Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) <ref> [3] </ref>. When an MH becomes active, it randomly transmits the first packet in a nonreserved slot. Once its transmission is successful, the MH will keep that slot in subsequent frames till the current "burst" of message transmission is completed.

Reference-contexts: The average durations of talkspurts and silence gaps are 1.0 and 1.35 seconds, respectively. BCH-codes are used for error correction for both voice and data packets. A packet is taken as a code of 255 bits. A signaling channel uses BCH code (31,11,5) <ref> [5] </ref> which means the M Hid can have 11 bits, which is fairly enough for a microcell. We use Gaussian method to approximate the bit error probability [9, 12]: 1 erfc 2 (z 1) + E b 2 where E b =N 0 is 10 dB.

Reference-contexts: This is called multiple-access interference (MAI). The more the MHs transmit together, the higher the probability of bit error.

Each slot of the CDMA system has a preamble part for the purpose of signaling and a packet transmission part for the packet content transmission. Using the preamble, a BS informs MHs which codes are available in next slot. <p> The voice and data transmission probabilities, p v and p d , are both chosen as 0.9 because as pointed out in <ref> [7] </ref>, a fixed retransmission probability of 0.9 can achieve near optimal performance. For all our configurations, we choose W of value 8, so for MSA, there can be 8 minislots in one code, each minislot occupies 255=8 = 31 bits.

Reference-contexts: Another scheme, idle-signal multiple access for integrated services (I-ISMA) [15], derived from PRMA, takes data services into consideration. In I-ISMA, all data packets and the first packet of voice talkspurt contend to access the channel. Another more general and flexible version of PRMA, namely mini-slot PRMA <ref> [8] </ref>, is designed to overcome some of the PRMA limitations. In each slot, a number of "mini slots" are dedicated to the transmission of reservations. If necessary, this number can be increased by assigning extra reservation channels and thus increase the the reservation capacity. <p> In this paper, we design another protocol in order to overcome these drawbacks. Preambles are no longer used in the slot structure. Instead, special codes are used specifically for code contending. These codes are divided into minislots, similar to the protocol presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. We compare this protocol, namely Minislot Signaling Access (MSA), with PSA protocol. Our research shows that MSA protocol performs better than PSA protocol under many circumstances, especially for voice services.

Reference-contexts: During a time slot, an MH uses preamble to contend for a code to transmit its packets. The BS decides whether to grant the MH a code based on consideration of satisfying the QoS of all the MHs. Based on Liu et al's work, Yang et al <ref> [16] </ref> proposed a MAC protocol which integrates data and voice traffic. 2 Meanwhile, for a long time, there have been many MAC protocols designed for time-division--based mobile communication systems, one of the best known is Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) [3]. <p> A different scheme is C-PRMA in [2].

If x and n r add up to less than L, all acquired signaling channels are acknowledged. Otherwise, only L n r signaling channels will be acknowledged. As pointed out in <ref> [16] </ref>, this limit is used to reduce the MAI during packet transmission and thus enhance the system performance. 5 2.3 Two Protocols for CDMA Medium Access Control In this section, we present two types of CDMA MAC schemes, namely, Preamble Signaling Access (PSA) and Minislot Signaling Access (MSA). 2.3.1 Preamble Signaling <p> 2.3 Two Protocols for CDMA Medium Access Control In this section, we present two types of CDMA MAC schemes, namely, Preamble Signaling Access (PSA) and Minislot Signaling Access (MSA). 2.3.1 Preamble Signaling Access (PSA) Scheme The first one, Preamble Signaling Access scheme, is similar to the MAC protocols proposed in <ref> [7, 16] </ref> as depicted in Figure 4 (a).
