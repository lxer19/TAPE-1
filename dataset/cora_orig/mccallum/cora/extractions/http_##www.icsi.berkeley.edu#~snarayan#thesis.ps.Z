Reference-contexts: It should be obvious the explicit equivalence of x-schemas to GSP N 0 S (ref. Section 3.10) allows them to model all the control aspects of finite state machine ( F SM ) type behavior compilers employed in <ref> (Connell 89) </ref> ( GSP N SP N P N F SM (Murata 1989)). The extension to continuous time allows our model to exhibit the high responsiveness to dynamic and uncertain environments that characterizes behavior-based models.

Reference-contexts: The work on on grasping and picking up a ball (Jeannerod 1986) demonstrated the need for concurrent activation of multiple synergies (arm movement and preshaping), serial execution, as error-correction based on perceptual input (vision and touch) <ref> (Arbib 1994) </ref>, and timed cerbellar modulation (Bullock 1995). The temporal details of motor actions are often mediated by afferent feedback. The Hering-Breuer reflex in the mammalian respiratory system is a good example of this phenomena. <p> Our design of x-schemas is inspired by and bears a strong resemblance to the work of Arbib's group. In fact, the example used to illustrate the computational issues involved in our design is taken from <ref> (Arbib 1994) </ref>. However, our focus on language and simulative inference renders our model quite different from those proposed by Arbib's group. (Drescher 1991) argues for the use of schema theory in learning behaviors and develops a computational model of schemas. <p> The basic cycle repeats (at a rate specified by the rate input parameter) until the agent receives information (asynchronously from an unscheduled perceptual process) of being at the destination. At this point the walking process is completed. 1 The high-level controller logic is taken from <ref> (Arbib 1994) </ref>. CHAPTER 3. AN EXECUTABLE MODEL OF ACTION VERBS 31 CHAPTER 3.

While there is no evidence of central control, there is good evidence of timing mechanisms that operate over multiple time scales <ref> (Ballard et al. 1997) </ref>. It is also clear that there is also a great deal of sophisticated brain structure and mental capacity already present at birth. In terms of connectivity, the evidence suggests that there are as many top-down as bottom-up connections.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION 7 study of linguistic devices which profile and focus on the internal temporal character of an event is referred to in linguistic research as the study of "aspect". In conjunction with tense, aspect forms a primary means for "grounding" (back-grounding and fore-grounding) and "relating" events in narrative <ref> (Berman & Slobin 1994) </ref>. Since most narratives are about events and their relations, tense and aspect are essential components of any Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system. <p> translation and cross-linguistic issues; to (Ter-Muelen 1995) for an innovative linguistic model that bears some resemblances to the work reported here; to (Michaelis 1992) for a construction-grammar approach to aspect and for arguments about the fundamental nature of the event/state distinction, (Langacker 1987) for the Cognitive Grammar approach, and to <ref> (Berman & Slobin 1994) </ref> for a developmental and cross-linguistic perspective.

Reference-contexts: However, the first proposal that schemas included storage of movement information including predicted outcomes and error information to drive learning appears to have been made by (Schmidt 1975). Furthermore, ever since Bernstein's <ref> (Bernstein 1967) </ref> pioneering work, research in biological control theory seems to have accepted the notion of motor synergies, which are sub-cortical parameterized continuous feedback controllers for stereotypical motions such as the vestibulo-occular reflex. While motor synergies control simple reflexes, most complex action control requires the coordination of multiple synergies.

Reference-contexts: Of course, this is not always good news since optimal planning with such expressive representations is likely to be harder as well. 7 Some consolation comes from recent work on GRAPHPLAN <ref> (Blum & Furst 1995) </ref> which shows how formal bi-partite graph structures very similar to x-schemas can aid in constructing efficient planning algorithms in real domains (by annotating, analyzing, and decorating the graph structure in specific ways).

Reference-contexts: These terms pertain to the importance of trade in an economy. As (Bradford 1991; Bhagwati 1987) and others point out, these concepts are graded and that one could place policies as being partially open or closed. The table below is based on data from <ref> (Bradford 1991) </ref> and describes the various ontological primitives in the discourse of trade policy. State Description Autarky No trade, Isolationism, self-reliant Import Substitution Discriminate against imports Liberalization trade based, internal liberalization Export push Subsidize exports In a closed economy, trade plays a relatively small part in the overall GDP. <p> The terms closed and open economies describe a state of affairs. Various development strategies or policies may influence these states. In general, economic policies may be inward oriented or outward oriented <ref> (Bradford 1991) </ref>. Inward oriented policies favor the domestic market whereas outward oriented policies favor trade and exports. The extreme version of inward orientation postulates delinking or isolationism leading to a completely closed economy. The extreme version of outward orientation results in subsidizing export industries leading to an export push. <p> The bias against imports may vary from complete protectionist to more selective policies. One intermediate form of outward orientation is internal liberalization that leads to an open economy. In an open economy the "incentives to import as as great as the incentives to export" <ref> (Bradford 1991) </ref>. In such an economy the import and export exchange rates are likely to be the same. At any given time, a country would fall into one of the aforementioned clusters. Adopting a specific policy, a country may transition from one cluster to another. CHAPTER 7.

Reference-contexts: We note that our notion of embodiment differs from that of the Behavior-based Robotics group <ref> (Brooks 1986) </ref> in that we believe that a critical aspect of embodiment concerns the structure and properties of the human brain.

In robotics, we note the similarities between x-schemas and behaviors used by the behavior-based Robotics group <ref> (Brooks 1986) </ref>. It should be obvious the explicit equivalence of x-schemas to GSP N 0 S (ref.

N. and Tanenhaus, M. K. </editor> <year> (1987). </year> <title> Thematic roles and language comprehension. </title>
Reference-contexts: In addition, we believe that metaphor mappings are sensitive to rather subtle semantic distinctions between concepts. Our results (ref. Chapter 9) suggest the need for detailed semantic representation of source and target domains to properly investigate the role of metaphoric mappings in interpretation. In influential early work on metaphor, <ref> (Carbonell 1982) </ref> looked at how metaphors are able to invariantly map plans and strategies across domains. The work presented here is consistent with Carbonell's observations that metaphors transfer planning knowledge across domains. <p> However, somewhat serendipitously (at least to this author), we found that embodied terms may in fact be compactly coding for these features as well. Note that this assertion is quite different from <ref> (Carbonell 1982) </ref> who hypothesized that entire strategies and plans (proof trees) ware invariantly transferred. In our theory, it is the key-event such as the thwarting of a goal, or the absence or production of a needed resource, etc. that is asserted using embodied terms.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we have extended our framework to be able to model the composition of multiple interacting dynamic systems. Our architecture is described in the next chapter (Chapter 6). We believe with this extension, we can begin to seriously investigate long-standing linguistic issues in aspectual composition. Nancy Chang <ref> (Chang 1997) </ref> has already made some progress in this regard. A brief description of this work can be found in Chapter 10. <p> So the question is very much open, what might a cognitive interpreter look like? 10.2 Extensions To the Aspect Model In recent work, Nancy Chang <ref> (Chang 1997) </ref> has investigated the use of the aspect model described in Chapter 5 to handle general aspectual composition. She has focussed on the combination of verbs, arguments and temporal modifiers in terms of the conceptual features they impose or contribute.

Reference-contexts: While his proposal showed the CHAPTER 3. AN EXECUTABLE MODEL OF ACTION VERBS 65 close connection between domain knowledge and interpretation, the uncontrolled nature of forward inferences led to severe intractability and counter-intuitive results <ref> (Charniak 1976) </ref>. Later, Schank's group scaled back the effort and used the idea of Scripts, where inferences were limited to narrow domains and text interpretation relied exclusively on stereotyped scenarios.

Reference-contexts: So Vendler's classification is clearly problematic. On the other hand, if we suggest that dying is telic, composed of a process and then an event, we should be able to say * Harry was dying, but recovered. Since this is quite a strange sentence for many speakers, <ref> (Comrie 1976) </ref> suggests a new class of situations where dying is a special telic predicate, one which does not allow its end-event to be prevented, once the associated process starts. Thus traditional accounts are forced to abandon compositionality (Comrie 1976) and invent a new class of situations, which once started cannot <p> Since this is quite a strange sentence for many speakers, <ref> (Comrie 1976) </ref> suggests a new class of situations where dying is a special telic predicate, one which does not allow its end-event to be prevented, once the associated process starts. Thus traditional accounts are forced to abandon compositionality (Comrie 1976) and invent a new class of situations, which once started cannot be prevented. In our model (assuming Comrie's reading) situations that cannot be interrupted is modeled by inhibiting the interrupt transition in the controller. This implies that the activity in question cannot be interrupted. <p> English does not have a Perfective/Imperfective morphological distinction, but several languages such as Russian, Mandarin, Spanish, etc. do. <ref> (Comrie 1976) </ref>. In our model, the perfective perspective involves applying the network transformation operation shown in Figure 5.12. This operation corresponds to not-monitoring the execution of a subnet. This leads to the situation shown in Figure 5.11. Figure 5.11 shows CHAPTER 5. <p> This account is consistent with and provides a computational model for the intuitions of (Michaelis 1992). 5.6 Current Work and Extensions 5.6.1 Perfect revisited So far, we discussed one of the meanings of the Perfect aspect, called the perfect of result <ref> (Comrie 1976) </ref>, which indicates that some consequence of the event in question holds at the time of description. A confirmatory test of the difference between the Perfect (as in I CHAPTER 5. <p> For instance, in English, use of the Perfect construction can signal that the described event has occurred at least once in the past. Such uses of the Perfect are called existential perfect <ref> (Comrie 1976) </ref> 11 . An example of this is John has been to India, where the sentence asserts that John was in India at least once (possibly more than once). Contrast this with John has gone to India which uses the perfect of result described earlier.

Reference-contexts: The process primitives characterize the inherent semantics of the verb. Any individual verb may have some or all of these parameters set to specific values. These parameters inspired by sensory motor primitives generalize Talmy's aspectual primitives (Talmy 1985) and can easily derive the Vendler-Taylor-Dowty classification V DT <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref>. <p> Specifically, the imperfective paradox ceases to be a problem with our representation. Section 5.5.5 discusses this issue in detail. 5.5.2 Some additional implications Our model can quite easily explain the observation <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref> that accomplishments (x-schemas with durations and goals) can serve as complements of the verb stop (as in Lucy stopped fixing the car) but that achievements (transitions to goal) cannot (as in *John stopped falling off the chair). Simply, transitions cannot be interrupted but x-schemas can. <p> Crucially, note that the progressive aspect binds to a dynamic process that corresponds to Jack expending energy and moving closer to the store. Contrast this to the Perfect where entirely different inferences are available to the interpreter. 5.5.5 Imperfective paradox The Imperfective Paradox <ref> (Dowty 1979) </ref> comes from trying to separate verbs of accomplishment from verbs of activity. One diagnostic test comes from the different entailments of the two verb classes when used in the Progressive Aspect. Consider the difference between Jack was walking and Jack was walking to the store. <p> This creates what is referred to as the imperfective paradox, and model theoretic accounts are forced to invent new unanalyzed CHAPTER 5.

Technically the resolution of the paradox relies on whether the reachability graph of the active x-schema contains the done state as a sub-marking, a question that can be answered by activation propagation over the x-schema as shown in Chapter 3. <p> CHAPTER 5.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 8 makes use of this and other mappings in our computational model of metaphoric projections of embodied events and actions. Recent linguistic work by Joe Grady <ref> (Grady 1996) </ref> suggests that large complex mappings such as the Event Structure map outlined above are best conceptualized as compositions of more primitive maps. Central to his argument is that these primitive maps are embodied or based in direct experiential correlations. <p> We believe that this insight may provide us methods to extend CHAPTER 10. CONCLUSION 256 the set of embodied mappings discussed in this thesis. There are some bright sides, however. Recent linguistic work by Joe Grady and Chris Johnson <ref> (Grady 1996) </ref> provides evidence that to properly understand metaphor usage and extension, the constraints of embodiment are critical.

Reference-contexts: While we have identified the issue, the implemented model is very ad-hoc and does not do justice to the importance of this issue in discourse processing. For instance, previous research has stressed the importance of goal-interactions (Wilensky 1983) and intentions and attentional focus <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref> in narrative understanding. We do believe that active, context-sensitive representations such as x-schemas should prove a good framework to investigate such issues in detail, but we don't have much by way of results yet.

Type-coercion theories <ref> (Moens & Steedman 1988) </ref> require that iteration coerce a durative activity into a punctual one, and once this coercion is made, an iterated reading of a progressive construction is possible. This again has problems. <p> The basic insight on representing tense comes from Reichenbach (Reichenbach 1947). Most implemented computational systems use some extension of the basic proposal. Our exposition follows that of <ref> (Moens & Steedman 1988) </ref> who use an extended version. Reichenbach's key idea for representing tense was to use three pointers to map the temporal relation expressed onto a timeline. The three pointers are called S (for speech time), R (for reference time) and E (for event time).

Reference-contexts: Stochastic Transitions are associated with an exponentially distributed random variable that expresses the delay between enabling and firing. Due to the memoryless feature of the exponential transition, x-schemas with stochastic transitions are isomorphic to semi-Markov processes (by analogy with Petri nets shown in <ref> (Molloy 1982) </ref>). Durative Transitions fire with a fixed delay ( &gt; 0 ) after being enabled. The actual delay is an CHAPTER 3.

From the discussion above we conclude that x-schemas are equivalent to ordinary Petri nets without stochastic transitions. 3.10.1 The Stochastic Case The continuous time stochastic Petri net was introduced by Molloy <ref> (Molloy 1982) </ref>. As described above, the firing time is governed by an exponentially distributed random variable x i . The firing time of transition t i is given by F x i = 1 e i x (3.10) CHAPTER 3.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION 3 us to refer to our verb model as x-schemas. X-schemas are parameterized routines with internal state that execute when invoked. 2 Our computational model of x-schemas is an extension to Petri nets <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. Our extensions allow run-time binding, hierarchical action sets and stochastic transitions. Chapter 3 states and proves a theorem establishing the formal connection between x-schemas and Petri nets which allows us to tap into the vast literature on Petri nets for specification, design and analysis of x-schemas. <p> This includes measure fluents such as energy and force. In addition, pre-conditions and post-conditions should be represented. CHAPTER 3. AN EXECUTABLE MODEL OF ACTION VERBS 33 3.3 Representation Of X-Schemas The computational model of x-schemas is based on an extension to Petri nets <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. Definition 2 Basic X-schema An x-schema consists of places ( P ) and Transitions ( T ) connected by weighted directed arcs A ( A 2 (P fi T ) [ (T fi P) ). <p> Section 3.10 details the proof of the theorem. The theorem is important to our effort since Petri nets are one of the most popular and well studied computational formalisms CHAPTER 3. AN EXECUTABLE MODEL OF ACTION VERBS 41 for specifying, modeling, and analyzing highly distributed and concurrent systems <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. Algorithms and analysis techniques from that literature can directly be brought in to our work. For instance, to model hierarchical action sets with variables and parameters, we extend the basic model to allow tokens to carry variable binding information (i.e. they are individuated and typed). <p> It should be obvious the explicit equivalence of x-schemas to GSP N 0 S (ref. Section 3.10) allows them to model all the control aspects of finite state machine ( F SM ) type behavior compilers employed in (Connell 89) ( GSP N SP N P N F SM <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>). The extension to continuous time allows our model to exhibit the high responsiveness to dynamic and uncertain environments that characterizes behavior-based models.

Reference-contexts: Finally, as Chapter 4 shows, x-schemas have deep connections to connectionist models of reasoning, allowing for a single representation to be viewed as a plausible computational model of high-level, coordination-oriented control of synergies, as well as a candidate representation for task-oriented robotic behaviors. 3.8.5 Teleo-reactive programs Recently, <ref> (Nilsson 1994) </ref> proposed the notion of Teleo-reactive control programs ( T R programs) which were developed to address the need to formalize a representation to compute and organize actions for autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments. Like x-schemas, T R programs are parameterized routines with run-time variable binding.

Reference-contexts: X-schemas are executing graphical structures that can be used for planning and monitoring an action or to provide real-time simulative inference. The version of x-schemas that we are currently using is an extension of a formalism known as Petri nets in computer science <ref> (Reisig 1985) </ref>. Their most important features are the ability to model both events and states in a distributed system, clean ways to capture concurrency and event-based asynchronous control in addition to the control primitives of sequence, conflicts and decisions. Our extensions include the addition of hierarchical control, parameterization and stochas-ticity. <p> Such arcs have a weight (also called multiplicity) of 1 . Executing an action (firing a transition) leaves the marking of an enable arc unchanged. Firings along enable arcs only occur if the output of the transition is unmarked (such firings are called contact-free in the Petri net literature <ref> (Reisig 1985) </ref>.) 2. Consume arcs correspond to resources that are consumed during execution. The amount consumed corresponds to the multiplicity of the corresponding arc. Consume arcs are standard Petri net arcs. 3. <p> The first part is concerned about the non-timed case, while the second is concerned about the timed and stochastic case. We begin with the following definitions. We represent x-schemas as a modified class of high-level Petri Nets <ref> (Reisig 1985) </ref>, where the modifications allow for stochastic transitions, as well as special compositional states and transitions (decomposable to a an ordered collection of primitive states and transitions), and run-time parameter binding.

Reference-contexts: This gives actions and agent-initiated (directed) world evolutions and other external events and occurrences equal status, making it impossible to model the attendant issues of intention, resources, and control. In this case, we are in concord with <ref> (Steedman 1995) </ref> in noting that an action-based representation is an essential first step to avoid the imperfective paradox. 2. The ability of our model to dynamically model the effects of resources and voluntary or involuntary suspensions seems to be essential to capture the issues involved. <p> This novel feature of our model distinguishes it from previous attempts to model aspect (Moens & Steedman 1988; Steedman 1995), and allows for a natural solution to the attendant issues of context-sensitivity and inference. We note that <ref> (Steedman 1995) </ref> proposes the use of dynamic logic to represent the semantics of tense and aspect. In this context, we are exploring the connection between x-schemas and a dynamic version of situation calculus. Other related work shows an equivalence between the multiplicative fragment of linear logic (Girard 1987) and x-schemas.

Reference-contexts: Early conceptual dependency theory (Rieger1975; Schank & Abelson 1977) used the idea of schemas for inference in discourse interpretation. We share many of the basic premises and guiding intuitions inherent in early work in conceptual dependency theory, including the need for a rich representation of actions, goals and resources <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref>. However, our use of a fine-grained, executable model for actions differs somewhat from these proposals. These issues are further discussed in Section 3.8. 3.1.4 Psychology and Cognitive Linguistics In psychology schemas have a long history. <p> This limitation proved too severe, and led to extensions that pertained to recognizing the importance of goals and their complex interactions in understanding stories <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref>, and the need for dynamic memory assemblages (Kolodner 1984). We share the basic premise inherent in conceptual dependency theory that sentences are ultimately mapped to a semantic representation that generates inferences. <p> Such considerations naturally led us to a rich representation of actions that is able to model the effects of dynamic enabling and disabling of goals, and the effects of resource production and consumption. As <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref> convincingly demonstrates, these are among the essential primitives for building story-understanding systems. One distinguishing feature of our x-schema-based representation of events is that they are more fine-grained than other proposals we have seen. <p> In contrast, while the central components of a RAP based model are easy to specify declaratively, detailed control is often hidden inside a method and we suspect would be fairly hard to specify formally within the language itself. As <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref> points out, a theory of plans that can be used in language understanding should be able to reason about fairly complicated resource and goal interactions. We take that to mean that such detailed information should be available for theory specification and analysis, rather than hidden inside some procedure. <p> Consider the following example. Resources can be locked (if shared) and then released at the end of some situation. Computation resources, such as attention can be modeled this way. While we argue that resources are important features of the aspectual class of a situation, <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref> contains a detailed description of how resource contention and limitations are often key features in understanding stories about conflicting or competing goals. <p> The central point he makes is that a theory of plans that is to be used in story understanding must be able to reason about negative goal interactions (such as goal conflicts and competition) as a result of resource limitations and conflicts. <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref> also has a detailed discussion of the knowledge required by such story understanding systems to deal with situations involving goal conflicts and goal competitions. Our x-schema-based model is completely consistent with this view and naturally models resource levels and changes in resource. <p> Our x-schema-based model is completely consistent with this view and naturally models resource levels and changes in resource. However, the impact of these on recognizing goal-interactions and possible resolution strategies of the sort described in <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref> is outside the scope of the system described here. Before proceeding further, we need one abstract parameter that is derivable from the parameters mentioned earlier and the context. This parameter pertains to the relation ship of the time scale of an activity to the time scale of reasoning. <p> While we have identified the issue, the implemented model is very ad-hoc and does not do justice to the importance of this issue in discourse processing. For instance, previous research has stressed the importance of goal-interactions <ref> (Wilensky 1983) </ref> and intentions and attentional focus (Grosz & Sidner 1986) in narrative understanding. We do believe that active, context-sensitive representations such as x-schemas should prove a good framework to investigate such issues in detail, but we don't have much by way of results yet.
