Reference-contexts: Therefore the resulting size of these circuits is much smaller than can be designed using general nonexponential methods. For the definition of other efficient factoring circuits and a good treatment of other important quantum computation issues see <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We have also shown that smaller circuits can tolerate errors of magnitude as high as =32. In the future we plan to investigate larger circuits such as the non-exponential factor-15 circuits proposed in [3] and <ref> [1] </ref> as well as investigating decoherence errors. We also plan to incorporate error correction schemes into our circuits.

Reference-contexts: The first circuit is the Los Alamos factor-4 [6] network which consists of 16 operations including a four-bit Quantum FFT. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the circuit constructed from gates defined in table 1. Figure 2 shows the four-bit Quantum FFT operation as defined by Coppersmith <ref> [2] </ref>. We have also developed optimized circuits for the factor-15 and factor-21 problems. The complexity of these circuits is exponential in the number of input bits (N ), but for factoring 15 and 21 N is small.

Reference-contexts: We define similar operations for the other gates. 2.1 Operations We simulated the quantum networks using the ten operations defined in Table 1. It has been shown that the controlled-not and rotation gates are all that are need to implement any network <ref> [4] </ref>, but we provide extra gates to simplify the networks. 1 2.2 Error Models We have incorporated four different models of "operation-induced" (loss) errors into our simulator. We have not modeled decoherence errors, but plan to investigate them in a future study.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Quantum computation <ref> [5] </ref> has generated a lot of interest in the past few years, mostly due to the discovery of a quantum algorithm to factor numbers in polynomial time [7]. A quantum computer can represent an exponentially large number of simultaneous states with a non-exponential number of bits.

Reference-contexts: This paper is organized into five sections. The next section describes the quantum simulator used as well as describing the four different error models. The third section describes the different circuits used in our simulations. We use the Los Alamos factor-4 <ref> [6] </ref> network, and special cases of the factor-15 and factor-21 problems. <p> The gaussian model determines how a network will operate under the influence of random noise in the control of quantum operations. 3 Quantum Circuits We have simulated three different factor circuits using each of the error models. The first circuit is the Los Alamos factor-4 <ref> [6] </ref> network which consists of 16 operations including a four-bit Quantum FFT. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the circuit constructed from gates defined in table 1. Figure 2 shows the four-bit Quantum FFT operation as defined by Coppersmith [2].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Quantum computation [5] has generated a lot of interest in the past few years, mostly due to the discovery of a quantum algorithm to factor numbers in polynomial time <ref> [7] </ref>. A quantum computer can represent an exponentially large number of simultaneous states with a non-exponential number of bits. Because of this, operations in a quantum computer have the potential of solving exponentially difficult problems in polynomial time. <p> For this circuit we also use the four-bit quantum FFT shown in figure 2. For a more detailed explanation of the factoring algorithm see <ref> [7] </ref>. The value X in the function f (A) must be picked so that it is relatively prime to N . If we pick the value seven for X we see the repeating pattern with period four shown in table 2.
