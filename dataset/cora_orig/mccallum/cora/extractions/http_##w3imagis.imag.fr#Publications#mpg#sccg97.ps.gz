Abstract: Implicit surfaces are well suited to modelling organic forms that consist of an internal skeleton and deformable flesh smoothly blended around it. An implicit surface can represent such an object's geometric "skin" that deforms according to the motion of the skeleton. We propose a new, simple and efficient method for calculating local deformations to be applied to implicit surfaces during collisions with other objects or between different parts of one object. We discuss applications of this method to deformable object simulation, character animation and interactive sculpture.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Of growing popularity in computer graphics, implicit surfaces [16] are particularly well suited to modelling organic forms [11, 2, 14] since they generate a smooth surface around skeletons of arbitrary geometry and topology. Animation of such forms is well established <ref> [1, 6, 8] </ref> and is normally performed in a layered model, in which the internal skeleton is used to specify the global be-haviour of an object and an implicit "skin" is moved and geometrically deformed according to the motion of the skeleton. <p> Various models were proposed to specify the motion of the skeleton, from a purely keyframe-based systems <ref> [1] </ref> to physics-based animation [6]. A hybrid animation approach can also be applied using both keyframes and dynamics [13]. 2.3 Modelling collisions Implicit surfaces are particularly advantageous for collision detection: a given point P is inside an implicit object if and only if f (P ) c (the inside/outside test).

Moreover, it required the use of expensive off-line rendering methods like ray tracing to create animation sequences. This paper proposes a new model, simple and easy to control, for generating local deformations that visually emphasise the occurrence of collisions.

Si Sj P0 Interpenetration zone Si Sj Propagation area for Si Solids after deformation The deformation method proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> is as follows. Let f 1 and f 2 be the potential functions of the two objects. When an interpenetration is detected: 1. <p> They are calculated so that the C 1 continuity of the deformed surface is preserved. 3. For a physics-based model, the reaction forces R i are calculated on the contact surface. They reflect the elastic characteristics of the materials in the direction normal to the contact surface (see <ref> [6] </ref>): R 1 = R 2 = (f 2 c)N 1 Since only the contact forces calculated in step 3 influence the motion of objects, purely geometric method is used to calculate the deformations in step 2.
