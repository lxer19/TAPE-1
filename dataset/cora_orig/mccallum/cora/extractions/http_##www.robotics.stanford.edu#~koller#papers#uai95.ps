Abstract: Stochastic simulation algorithms such as likelihood weighting often give fast, accurate approximations to posterior probabilities in probabilistic networks, and are the methods of choice for very large networks. Unfortunately, the special characteristics of dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs), which are used to represent stochastic temporal processes, mean that standard simulation algorithms perform very poorly. In essence, the simulation trials diverge further and further from reality as the process is observed over time. In this paper, we present simulation algorithms that use the evidence observed at each time step to push the set of trials back towards reality. The first algorithm, "evidence reversal" (ER) restructures each time slice of the DPN so that the evidence nodes for the slice become ancestors of the state variables. The second algorithm, called "survival of the fittest" sampling (SOF), "repopulates" the set of trials at each time step using a stochastic reproduction rate weighted by the likelihood of the evidence according to each trial. We compare the performance of each algorithm with likelihood weighting on the original network, and also investigate the benefits of combining the ER and SOF methods. The ER/SOF combination appears to maintain bounded error independent of the number of time steps in the simulation.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes an experimental comparison of these techniques with naive LW. 2 Evidence reversal It has long been known that stochastic simulation algorithms are quite effective if the network contains no evidence <ref> (Dagum and Luby, 1993) </ref>. The same argument can be used to show that if all the evidence in a network is at the root nodes, approximating the probabilities in the rest of the network is computationally tractable.

Reference-contexts: They can be used to project possible future evolutions of the observed system by adding slices into the future. When decision nodes are added, they enable approximately rational decision-making with a limited horizon (Tatman and Shachter, 1990). We have used them for freeway surveillance <ref> (Huang et al., 1994) </ref> and for controlling an autonomous vehicle (Forbes et al., 1995). In this paper, we concentrate on the use of DPNs for monitoring, i.e., maintaining a probability distribution over the possible current states of the world.

Reference-contexts: Exact clustering algorithms for DPNs are described by Kjaerulff (1992). In our applications, we have found that the clustering approach is too expensive and that exact probabilities are not needed. Furthermore, when continuous variables are included, DPNs seldom conform to the structural requirements for CG distributions <ref> (Lauritzen and Wermuth, 1989) </ref>. Hence, exact algorithms are not available. We have therefore investigated the use of stochastic simulation algorithms, which often provide fast approximations to the required probabilities and can be used with arbitrary combinations of discrete and continuous distributions.
