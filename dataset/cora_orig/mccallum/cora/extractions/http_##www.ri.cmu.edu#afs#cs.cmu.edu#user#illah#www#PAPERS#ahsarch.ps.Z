Abstract: The principled design of robot architecture is crucial for the development of low-cost and reliable robotics. Recent advances in the study of robot architecture indicate that layered architectures are becoming the standard model throughout the robotics community. In this paper, we describe architecture development for the design of automated highway vehicles. These robots are unique in that they combine the fundamental robot challenges of autonomy and reliability with the less traditional issues of human-computer interaction and division of control. We propose a robot architecture, derived from the standard layered model, that enables a systemwide view of the human-machine autonomous system. We then discuss the hybrid nature of the human-computer interaction scheme, describing several possible human-machine hybrid vehicle controllers.

Reference-contexts: As a result, highway autonomy can only proceed via an incremental deployment of the automation. propose to meet these challenges. This architecture is an instance of a layered architecture, in which system control is divided between multiple modules, or layers, based upon representational resolution, both geometric and temporal <ref> [1] </ref>. A layered architecture is useful in this situation for several reasons. At development-time, layers provide natural boundaries for incremental implementation and testing.

Reference-contexts: At the technical level, of course, a highest level strategic system is already in operation on many vehicles. A lowest level Skill layer, at the Skill I level, has been successfully tested <ref> [6] </ref>. Nevertheless, the nontechnical issues as well as the unsolved engineering challenges lying in wait at the Skill II and Tactical Layer demand that the system architecture be capable of incorporating human control at any architectural layer.

Reference-contexts: The complexities of the system should reside within the layers themselves, and the interfaces should be well-defined and simple <ref> [7] </ref>. The following discussion provides a framework for the kinds of information that pass between the layers shown in Figure 2. An important global view concerning the interfaces is that they are meant to communicate information as well as subgoals.

Reference-contexts: This functional definition allows us to avoid a common trap in architecture design. Robot architectures commonly make premature representational decisions, frequently imposing an explicit and symbolic form of knowledge at the higher layers and an implicit, reactive encoding at lower layers. As has been demonstrated by Rosenschein & Kaelbling <ref> [8] </ref>, functional intelligence can be achieved through either implicit or explicit, symbolic or nonsymbolic techniques, and so these decisions are premature. 2.1 Skill Layer The Skill Layer is responsible for both reactive safety and the robots lowest level of control.
