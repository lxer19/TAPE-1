Abstract: We consider a special case of the general problem involving the routing of packages among vehicles in transportation networks. In this special case, the schedules of the vehicles are fixed and packages are routed by transferring them between vehicles as these vehicles make stops according to their fixed schedules. Since this problem is NP-Complete, we explore approximation algorithms for its solution. In particular, we cast this problem as a multicommodity flow problem with a mixed integer/linear program formulation. We then apply combinatorial optimization techniques based on solving the relaxed linear programming formulation of the problem to obtain a solution with provable constraint violation bounds and expected performance guarantees, where performance is measured in terms of the sum of the time in transit over all packages. We investigate the sensitivity of the performance guarantees to certain scaling factors and other limitations of this technique.

Reference-contexts: This work introduces the concept of randomized rounding in which high-probability approximations are obtained for integer problems by first solving a relaxed linear program and then using the resulting real-number values to determine integer values for the variables.

Reference-contexts: The first stage of this two stage process can be solved by algorithms such as those designed for the dial-a-ride problem <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. The solution resulting from this first process is composed of vehicles with fixed schedules and possibly unused capacity. In this work we develop techniques to handle problems with these features and, thus, solve the second stage of this multistage scheduling approach.

Reference-contexts: where delivery (p) = min t2T floc (p; t) = snk p g is the time at which package p is delivered at its sink? It is clear that the NP-completeness of the feasibility problem implies the NP-completeness of the optimization problem. 3SAT is described by the following decision problem <ref> [5] </ref>: 6 INSTANCE Set U of variables, collection C of clauses over U such that each clause c 2 C has jcj = 3. QUESTION Is there a satisfying truth assignment for C? 3SAT was shown to be NP-complete by Cook [2] as a transformation from Satisfiability. <p> The problem is then to produce m flow functions such that the combined flows do not violate the constraints generalized from the two-commodity case. The integral version is NP-complete <ref> [5] </ref>, although the fractional version of the problem is solvable by linear programming in polynomial time. The multicommodity flow problem has been well-studied and there are several approximation algorithms for its solution [7].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this is not the case. In this section, we outline the NP-Completeness results given in <ref> [6] </ref>. We show that the capacity constrained package transfer problem is NP-complete through a reduction from 3-Satisfiability (3SAT). It is convenient for our reduction to consider the problem of Section 2 as a feasibility problem rather than an optimization problem. <p> QUESTION Is there a satisfying truth assignment for C? 3SAT was shown to be NP-complete by Cook [2] as a transformation from Satisfiability.

The multicommodity flow problem has been well-studied and there are several approximation algorithms for its solution <ref> [7] </ref>. In this section, we provide a time-space transformation for expressing discrete time problems such as capacity constrained package transfer as integral multicommodity flow problems. As noted in Section 2, fixed asset schedules subsume the lengths of the direct routes of the transportation graph.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we establish the complexity of this problem. This NP-Completeness result motivates the approximation algorithms developed in the remainder of the paper. The approximation algorithms we consider are variants of the randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. Since this technique has been applied to multi-commodity flow problems, in Section 4 we provide a polynomial reformulation from the capacity constrained package transfer problem to the multicommodity flow problem. <p> In this section, we describe the randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson <ref> [9, 8] </ref> and apply it to the capacity constrained package transfer problem. We discuss in turn, each of the following phases in the randomized rounding technique: 1. Formulate and solve linear programming relaxation of integral multicommodity flow problem, 10 2. <p> This analysis gives us a practical bound to employ in these cases. In order to explore the feasibility of the integral solution (i.e., capacity constraints are not violated), given a feasible fractional solution, we introduce the general analysis technique of Raghavan and Thompson <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. Their technique employs a Chernoff-type bound on the flow assigned to each edge (load) exceeding the edge capacity, for any edge, in the integral solution. Let a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a r be reals in (0; 1]. <p> Let X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X r be independent Bernoulli trials with E [X j ] = p j . Look at the random variable = P r 15 (1+ffi) (1+ffi) ] 10 Theorem 2 <ref> [8] </ref> Let ffi &gt; 0, and m = E [] = P r j=1 a j p j &gt; 0. <p> The right hand side of Theorem 2 can be a little difficult to deal with, especially when trying to determine questions such as "how large need ffi be for Pr [ &gt; (1 + ffi)m] to be less than x?" For a desired probability bound, Raghavan <ref> [8] </ref> provides a technique for estimating the deviation ffi to use in Theorem 2. Namely, denote Pr [ &gt; (1 + ffi)m] by B (m; ffi). <p> This may not be sufficient for capacity constrained package transfer problem instances with hard constraints. In Section 6.3, we discuss a deterministic variation to overcome this deficiency. 6.2 Deterministic Variation of Randomized Rounding, Providing Bounds within Guaranteed Range Raghavan <ref> [8] </ref> provides a deterministic method for guaranteeing that the load assigned to any edge in the integer solution will not exceed the fractional solution (edge's capacity) by more than the guaranteed bound (1 + ffi). This method can be outlined as follows. <p> Figure 7.i., we see that if our problem contains 10 edges, one of which has capacity 0:1, the best overall bound we can provide is ffi = 12 (where ffi = max 1in ffi i ). 20 6.3 Deterministic Variation of Randomized Rounding, Providing Guaranteed Upper Bounds Raghavan and Thompson <ref> [8, 9] </ref> provide a solution to guarantee that no load will exceed the capacity of its edge based on scaling.
