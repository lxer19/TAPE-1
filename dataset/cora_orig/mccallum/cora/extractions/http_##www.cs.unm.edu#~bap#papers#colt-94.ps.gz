Title: Playing the Matching-Shoulders Lob-Pass Game with Logarithmic Regret  
Author: Joe Kilian Kevin J. Lang Barak A. Pealmutter 
Date: April 26, 1994  
Abstract: The best previous algorithm for the matching shoulders lob-pass game, Abe and Takeuchi's (1993) ARTHUR, suffered O(t 1=2 ) regret. We prove that this is the best possible performance for any algorithm that works by accurately estimating the opponent's payoff lines. Then we describe an algorithm which beats that bound and meets the information-theoretic lower bound of O(log t) regret by converging to the best lob rate without accurately estimating the payoff lines. The noise-tolerant binary search procedure that we develop is of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: 1 Background The lob-pass problem has its origins in the animal psychology literature <ref> (Herrnstein, 1990) </ref>, but following Abe and Takeuchi (1993) we consider it to be the following simplified tennis game. For each of a sequence of plays we choose to make either a lob or a passing shot.
