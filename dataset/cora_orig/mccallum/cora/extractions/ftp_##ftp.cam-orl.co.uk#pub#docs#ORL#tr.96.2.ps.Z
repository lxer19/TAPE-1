Abstract: Previous work has described teleporting, an approach to mobile computing in which it is the user's personal application environment which is mobile rather than the hardware on which the applications run. In this paper we describe a new teleporting system which makes the user's environment available on any machine in the world running a Java-compliant web browser. We present some preliminary experimental results together with discussions of security and performance issues.

Reference-contexts: The VNC system is a step in that direction insofar as it makes available on virtually any internet-connected machine a computing environment completely determined by the user. Another X-based architecture for mobile applications on the web is presented in <ref> [2] </ref> together with a good overview and analysis of the central issues in designing such an architecture. The approach taken is similar to ours, although it relies on X on the browser side as well as the application side.

Reference-contexts: The remote device for which we originally developed the RFB service (and on which we are still using it) is a video tile, a pen-based ATM-connected display <ref> [5] </ref>. The RFB client running on the tile passes pen events as mouse events to the RFB X server and puts all screen changes it receives onto the tile display, thereby allowing interaction with X applications on the tile.
