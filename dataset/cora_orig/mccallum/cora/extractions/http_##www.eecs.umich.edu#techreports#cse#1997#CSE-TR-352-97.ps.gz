Abstract: The proliferation of computer networks in the last decade and the ubiquity of the World Wide Web have led to increased interest in the development of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems. Collaborative, multi-user applications require group multicast services that provide ordering guarantees for maintaining consistency of replicated shared context as well as provide a high degree of interactivity, even under varying load on the multicast servers. While the most common view of the quality of service (QoS) in a distributed system is in terms of the guarantee of the network connection parameters (bandwidth, end-to-end delay), in this paper we investigate QoS from the perspective of the various requirements placed on group communication servers with limited resources by multiple and diverse groups of collaborative users. We show that in the absence of QoS considerations in the design of a group communication service, some groups or individual users can be severely affected by bursty traffic or increase in the size of other groups. We present the design of a best-effort QoS-based adaptive group communication service for supporting reliable data communication in CSCW systems. Our QoS considerations address both group's requirements and individual user's requirements. We present performance results showing the effectiveness of the approach and discuss some of the open issues for future work.

Reference-contexts: The server is currently written in Java, to allow scientists quick prototyping and experimentation of the server on various platforms. Figure 1 shows the graphical interfaces of some of the Corona-based collaboration tools. 2.1 Overview of Corona Group Communication: The basic unit of communication in Corona is the group <ref> [1] </ref>. A group is defined to be a set of processes, termed members. A group has a shared state and the members of the group operate on the shared state by accessing and modifying the shared objects in the shared state.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 concludes the paper with a brief summary of our work and our future plans. 2 Background Our work on the quality of service in computer-supported synchronous collaboration has its origin in a NSF-sponsored project, called the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (UARC) <ref> [6] </ref>. The UARC project focuses on developing an experimental testbed for wide-area scientific collaboratory work.

Reference-contexts: A client joins a group and receives the shared state of the group or leaves a group unobtrusively; the existing processes in the group are able to carry on with their operations in the presence of multiple, concurrent joins and leaves. The Corona server allows clients to specify roles <ref> [7] </ref> when joining a group. The group multicast service provides interfaces for broadcasting updates on shared state. Messages from members of a group are multicast as point-to-point messages in the order of arrival to all the members, thus ensuring total order. <p> Chaterjee et al. [3] present two models to facilitate adaptive QoS-driven resource management in heterogeneous distributed systems and propose a graceful degradation of the application QoS under certain circumstances.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of the system has evolved through several generations of prototypes. The current design is an applet-based architecture implemented in Java, taking advantage of the accessibility and ubiquity of the World 2 Wide Web and Java platform-independence. A server, called Corona ( <ref> [8] </ref>, [17]), provides multicast services to support various collaboration tools. These include various shared data viewers for graphically displaying instrument data, a multi-party chat box for exchanging textual messages, and a notebook-like draw tool for saving and sharing notes, images and drawings.

Reference-contexts: We can use QoS-based policies for scheduling multicasting tasks within the Corona server.

Reference-contexts: Also, in a long-duration collaboration, there can be long periods of inactivity followed by bursts of activity, e.g., depending on the interest in the evolving scientific data. So, apriori reservation of resources at the servers ( <ref> [10] </ref>) can be difficult for the clients to do or can be inefficient. Service based on group characteristics: Some multicast groups can be more important than others. <p> Robin et al.

[19] from the perspective of communication protocols, operating systems, multimedia databases, and file servers. Nahrstedt and Smith <ref> [13] </ref> point out that in order to provide applications with end-to-end guarantees, network resource management alone is not sufficient and indicate a need to balance resources among the application, network, and operating system at the endpoints, and between endpoints and the network.

Reference-contexts: Users may want events occurring in real-time to be given higher priority at the server than archived events. 4.2 Client Roles and Client Priority Users may have roles in a group, requiring better service for some members than others. As noted in <ref> [14] </ref>, the assignment of roles has a social meaning, the ones who are making a more important contribution being assigned more important roles.
