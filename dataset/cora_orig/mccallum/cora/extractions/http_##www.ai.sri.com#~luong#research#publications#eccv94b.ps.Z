Abstract: The Fundamental matrix is a key concept when working with uncalibrated images and multiple viewpoints. It contains all the available geometric information and enables to recover the epipolar geometry from uncalibrated perspective views. This paper is about a stability analysis for the Fundamental matrix. We first present a probabilistic approach which works well. This approch, however, does not give insight into the causes of unstability. Two complementary explanations for unstability are the nature of the motions, and the interaction between motion and three-dimensional structure, which is characterized by a critical surface. Practical methods to characterize the proximity to the critical surface from image measurements, by estimating a quadratic transformation, are developped. They are then used for experiments which validate our observations. It turns out that surprisingly enough, the critical surface affects the stability of the fundamental matrix in a significant number of situations.

Reference-contexts: We only know that f minimizes a known criterion, and this can be dealt with using a method based on the implicit functions theorem, presented in <ref> [1] </ref>, and used for instance in [16]. Two examples, one with epipoles near the image center, the other with epipoles far away, are given in Fig. 2, where we have superimposed the uncertainty ellipses corresponding to a 90% probability, computed from the exact point coordinates, and the image frames.

Reference-contexts: For both approaches, we have designed a method consisting in a combination of the linear solution and non-linear minimization with an appropriate parameterization and symmetric Euclidean distance.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental matrix has been computed from point correspondences using the quadratic criterion derived from the linear relation (2). The epipoles e and e 0 are then computed from this matrix <ref> [6] </ref>. The coefficients of the epipolar homography have been computed from the point correspondences and the correct epipoles, using a linear least-squares formulation based on the relation derived by making substitutions of (3) in (4). A relative distance [6], has been used to quantify the positional errors of the epipoles found. <p> The epipoles e and e 0 are then computed from this matrix <ref> [6] </ref>. The coefficients of the epipolar homography have been computed from the point correspondences and the correct epipoles, using a linear least-squares formulation based on the relation derived by making substitutions of (3) in (4). A relative distance [6], has been used to quantify the positional errors of the epipoles found. Since the four coefficients of the epipolar transformation are defined only up to a scale factor, we have normalized them by dividing by a, which allows to consider a relative error for each of them. <p> From the results of the simulation shown Fig. 1, it is clear that: The stability of the epipoles in each of the images is comparable, which was to be expected, since the criterion (2) is symmetrical. Note that the non-linear criteria proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> also share this property. Fig. 1. Sensitivity to noise of the different components of the fundamental matrix Once the epipoles are determined correctly, the computation of the homography is quite stable, and thus that the more unstable part of the computation is the determination of the epipoles.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms provide us a practical means to quantify the proximity of the 3D points which have given rise to point correspondences, to such a critical surface, much the same way than the computation of an homography between projective coordinates of point correspondences <ref> [7] </ref> allowed us to assess the proximity of the 3D points to a plane. <p> This is a generalization of the homography which we encountered and studied in the case of planes <ref> [7] </ref> . The quadratic transformation allows us to check if image points are close to the projection of a critical surface, much the same way as the homography allowed us to check if they were close to the projection of a plane.

Reference-contexts: More recently, affine geometry has been found to provide an interesting framework borrowing some nice characteristics from both Euclidean geometry and projective geometry. Affine calibration also requires the determination of the fundamental matrix [14], <ref> [8] </ref>. A great deal of work has been devoted to the problem of characterizing the stability of estimation of Euclidean motion, however nothing has been done, to our knowledge, to characterize the stability of estimation of the fundamental matrix. <p> We thus conclude from this simulation that an adequate measure for the stability of the fundamental matrix is the stability of one of its epipoles. Note that this is consistent with the findings of <ref> [8] </ref>, where it has been shown that the epipole plays a particular role in the projective description of the geometry of a system of two cameras. 3 A Probabilistic Characterization A classic characterization of uncertainty is to use covariance matrices.

Reference-contexts: Euclidean descriptions can then be obtained, but a significant amout of flexibility is lost to this procedure, which cannot be used practically an active system. Thus, a second approach is emerging <ref> [12] </ref>, which consists in using projective geometry, whose non-metric nature allows to use uncalibrated cameras. These approaches use only geometric information which relates the different viewpoints.
