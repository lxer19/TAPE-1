Title: Executive Summary  
Abstract: Automation of driving functions is central to proposals for the design of an Automated Vehicle/Highway System (AVHS). In the control architecture in [Var93], it is proposed that vehicles travel in platoons. Three maneuvers are needed: in merge, two platoons join together; in split, one platoon separates into two; and in change lane, a single vehicle changes lane. Using these maneuvers, a vehicle enters the system, becomes part of a platoon, travels to its destination, detaches itself from the rest of the platoon, and exits out of the system. In this paper we consider the following problem. Consider an AVHS, for example the system proposed in [Var93, GL94, FAHL94, HESV93]. How do we know that such a system is safe? Of course we have to define what safety means. We say a system is unsafe if there is a possibility of a high relative velocity collision on the AVHS. We want to prove for a proposed design of an AVHS, that there is no such possibility. We can simulate the system. But that only checks safety for a finite number of simulation paths or trajectories of the system. We want to prove safety for every trajectory of the system. In this paper we develop an approach for proving that a system is safe. We consider the design for an AVHS proposed in [Var93] and show that if the physical controllers in the vehicles satisfy a set of constraints then the AVHS is safe. The problem of checking whether the controllers satisfy the constraints is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem.
