Title: An Analysis of Statistical and Syntactic Phrases  
Author: Mandar Mitra Chris Buckley Amit Singhal Claire Cardie 
Affiliation: Cornell University  Sabir Research Inc.  AT&T Research  Cornell University  
Abstract: As the amount of textual information available through the World Wide Web grows, there is a growing need for high-precision IR systems that enable a user to find useful information from the masses of available textual data. Phrases have traditionally been regarded as precision-enhancing devices and have proved useful as content-identifiers in representing documents. In this study, we compare the usefulness of phrases recognized using linguistic methods and those recognized by statistical techniques. We focus in particular on high-precision retrieval. We discover that once a good basic ranking scheme is being used, the use of phrases does not have a major effect on precision at high ranks. Phrases are more useful at lower ranks where the connection between documents and relevance is more tenuous. Also, we find that the syntactic and statistical methods for recognizing phrases yield comparable performance.

To identify the syntactic phrases present in a document, we first tag every word in the document with its part of speech (POS) using the Brill tagger <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. Certain tag patterns are then recognized as noun phrases (NPs). The following grammar specifies the POS tag patterns that are recognized as phrases 1 .

Several top-ranked documents discuss pension plans but do not deal with associated problems. The problem in such cases can be termed as one of inadequate query coverage <ref> [4] </ref>. The use of phrases does not consistently address this problem: in a query with multiple aspects, a phrase normally does not capture the multiple aspects of the query, but deals with one particular aspect only.

In the following, therefore, we consider two-word phrases only. 3 This value has been used for a long time at Cornell. Experiments by Grefenstette et al. <ref> [11] </ref> also conclude that operationally, this is a good value.
