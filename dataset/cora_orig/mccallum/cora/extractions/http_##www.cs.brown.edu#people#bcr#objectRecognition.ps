Abstract: This paper discusses our design and implementation of a simple featur e based object r ecognition system. O ur design is par tially motiv ated b y the multiple-views hypothesis. Our primary concern is how a set of simple local featur e detectors can be used in object r ecogni-tion, and what implementational and theoretical issues are most salient. We are also inter ested in ho w object complexity is r elated to the number of vie ws required for good r ecognition, whether cer tain featur es ar e better tuned to the r ecognition task, and ho w r obust the system is under v arious transformations. The system incorporates a center of mass pr ocedure to provide translation inv ariance, as w ell as to simulate foveation. P art of the pr oject is to be later used in conjunction with a networ k of networks realization of the grassfire algorithm. When used as a fr ont end to grassfire, we believe that our system will become ev en more robust.

Reference-contexts: Our vision system has a behavior similar to sev eral low-level stages of vision, namely the synthesis of groups of r eceptors (pix els) into simple featur es. The network of networ ks grassfir e algorithm <ref> (Anderson and S utton, 1995) </ref>, which has not y et been incorpo - rated, builds on the information gained fr om lo wer levels, and models a mor e advanced stage in the visual pathway. 2.

Reference-contexts: As dealing with these issues occupied much of our time and thought, w e mention them her e, although the final product does not necessarily follo w this scheme. A method w e consider ed early on was using the BSB model <ref> (Anderson et al., 1977) </ref> to perform error correction on the image chunk. The BSB networ k would store all templates, and it would iterate over each image chunk to output the featur e present.

Reference-contexts: This might be implemented as a genetic algorithm based experiment. N euronal G roup S election Theory <ref> (Edelman, 1987) </ref> might provide some insight into this. 5. Implementation info The system was implemented in C ++ in a UNIX environment, using data str uctures fr om the STL.

Reference-contexts: Certainly, biological vision systems ar e tuned to properties of the world that ar e relevant to its survival, as was sho wn regarding the fr og <ref> (Lettvin et al., 1959) </ref>. An interesting experiment might be to introduce some form of cost-reward function, a set of randomly generated featur es, and a visual task, and see which set of features pr oved optimal in achieving that task. This might be implemented as a genetic algorithm based experiment.
