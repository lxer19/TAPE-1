Reference-contexts: We have some prototypes in VRML but they are not general and also slow. VRML is not the answer for all visualizations <ref> (Akeley 1998) </ref>. This remains an open problem. SGI MineSet runs only on Silicon Graphics hardware. This was a restriction because it limited our market (but increased hardware sales). We are now porting MineSet to other platforms, starting with Windows.

Reference-contexts: Significant time was spent waiting for the complete tree to be built, only to realize that we had a near perfect predictor that we needed to remove. Anytime algorithms <ref> (Boddy & Dean 1989) </ref> show some results quickly and then improve. The idea is an extension of the "effort knob" mentioned in Thearling (1998). Process Wizards As data mining will be available to more business users, we need to provide more help on the processes and tasks.

Reference-contexts: This area is not well understood and commercial Query Builders do not support needed operations. KDD project management MineSet provides session management and allows saving and restoring sessions. However, there is no system for keeping track of the overall KDD process <ref> (Brachman & Anand 1996) </ref>. Users end up with dozens of models and session files. Meta Knowledge MineSet has no meta-knowledge database. In many cases processes could be simplified by knowing basic properties of data, goals, and tasks.

Reference-contexts: MineSet first released in early 1996 mostly as a visualization product and then became a full data mining and visualization product late that year with several data mining algorithms based on MLC ++ <ref> (Kohavi, Sommerfield & Dougherty 1997) </ref>. The engineering effort in product development is estimated at over 55 person years, with the engineering team consisting of 17 people right now.

Reference-contexts: Scaling out of Core Most data mining algorithms (including those in MineSet) are implemented to run in memory and degrade ungracefully if the data and data structures do not fit in memory. (A notable exception is SPRINT <ref> (Shafer, Agrawal & Mehta 1996) </ref>.) With the growth of operating systems and apps to 64-bit, we see little need for scaling out of core (but we do see the need to generate 64-bit versions of existing algorithms).
