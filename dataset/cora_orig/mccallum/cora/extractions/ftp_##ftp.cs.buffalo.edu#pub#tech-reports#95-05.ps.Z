Abstract: Efficiently storing and retrieving images in a digital library have recently become active topics. Due to the limitation of traditional keyword-based retrieval approach, content-based image retrieval becomes increasingly demanding in today's digital library applications. Using fractal image compression technique, we have observed that its self-transformation property to compress images can be utilized to automatically index images by content. In this paper, we investigate the effect of fractal image coding on content-based image indexing. The initial experiments conducted on biomedical images demonstrate that this approach not only greatly reduces image storage but also is effective on indexing images by content. We thus believe that fractal coding provides a promising indexing approach to digital libraries.

Reference-contexts: For example, a common retrieval request would be to find all images that are similar to a given image. The purpose of content-based indexing techniques is to provide a vehicle of implementing efficient content-based retrievals. Various semantic-based models <ref> [CIT94] </ref> have been proposed to organize such indices. In these models, the features of an image is extracted from its content. Such features may include format descriptors, intrinsic and spatial relationships among image components, etc. This profound information is then used to form indices which represent the image.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the fractal compression approach is lossy [MAH94]. Since Jacquin's initial work in fractal block image coding, there are lots of extensions which enhance the initial work in one way or another. Worth of mention is that Fisher, Jacob and Boss <ref> [FJB91] </ref> introduced adaptive methods in the encoding. They used quadtree, rectangular and triangular partitions of the range blocks to improve the image fidelity. Other researchers improved to targeting the complexity reduction of encoding and faster way of decoding [LQR94]. Fractal coding is a promising approach to image compression.

Reference-contexts: We will demonstrate that images can be differentiated based on their fractal codes (or transformations). Consequently, the characteristics of an image can be identified by its fractal codes. Consider the following three transformations that are given in <ref> [FL92] </ref>: W 1 6 6 x z 7 7 = 6 6 0:5 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 2 6 4 y 3 7 5 2 6 4 0 3 7 5 2 6 4 y 3 7 5 2 6 4 0 0:5 0 3 7 5 6 <p> The images generated from the first three iterations of the above transformations and the final converged image are shown in Figure 1 <ref> [FL92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Fractal coding technique has been proposed to perform image compression and its result has been shown to be very effective. The main characteristics of this approach are that it assumes that image redundancy can be captured and exploited through piecewise self-transformability <ref> [Jac93] </ref>. The method approximates an original image by obtaining from a finite number of iterations of an image transformation called a fractal code. <p> This approach is based on the concepts and mathematical results of iterated function systems (IFS).

Within a short period of devel opment, fractal coding has yielded results which rival the best examples of data compression by other methods. It's a lossy method and usually takes time to encode.

Reference-contexts: This transformation code, iteratively applied to any initial image, will generate a simulated version of the original image. To ensure the convergence at the decoder, the union of all transformations W have to be contractive. Thus, the fractal compression approach is lossy <ref> [MAH94] </ref>. Since Jacquin's initial work in fractal block image coding, there are lots of extensions which enhance the initial work in one way or another.

Reference-contexts: The former approach seems neither interesting nor acceptable in practice; and the latter approach is an on-going research topic in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, which is not yet completely solved. Rabitti and Savino <ref> [RS91] </ref> have developed an integrated approach to image indexation and retrieval using the results generated in the image recognition analysis process. However, the investigation in this direction is still in its infancy. Another promising research direction is to automatically index image content based on image coding.

Reference-contexts: However, the investigation in this direction is still in its infancy. Another promising research direction is to automatically index image content based on image coding. It has been observed that fractal coding may play an important role in developing such indexing techniques <ref> [Slo94] </ref>. However, this research direction has not been deeply pursued. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic indexing approach based on fractal image compression technique. Fractal coding technique has been proposed to perform image compression and its result has been shown to be very effective. <p> Note that we do not need exact match between iconic images and different portions of images in the image database. We choose similarity measure, and can set different criteria of similarity. Another approach given in <ref> [Slo94] </ref> is to juxtapose an iconic image and each image in the image database. Synthetic images are then generated and each of which is coded using the fractal coding method. The generated codes are then analyzed. The fractal encoder will describe the synthetic image in terms of itself.
