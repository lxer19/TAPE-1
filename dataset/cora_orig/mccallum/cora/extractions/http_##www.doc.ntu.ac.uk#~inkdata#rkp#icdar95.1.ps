Title: Abstract  
Abstract: This paper describes a wholistic recognizer developed for use in a hybrid recognition system. The recognizer uses information about the word shape. As this information is strongly related to word zoning, care is taken to avoid limitations resulting from the inaccuracy of zone detection. The recognizer uses a very simple set of features and a fuzzy set based pattern matching technique. This aims to increase its robustness, but also causes problems with disambiguation of the results. A verification mechanism, using letter alternatives as compound features, is introduced. The letter alternatives are obtained from a segmentation based recognizer coexisting in the hybrid system. The wholistic recognizer is found capable of outperforming the segmentation based one, despite the remaining disambiguation problems. When working together in a hybrid system, the results are significantly higher than those of the individual recognizers. Recognition results are reported and compared. Keywords: online cursive script recognition, word shape, wholistic recognition, multiple interactive segmentation, hybrid recognition, results combination

Reference-contexts: The resulting disambiguation problem is addressed by letter verification. The treatment of letter alternatives as higher level handwriting features is also reported in the results combination literature <ref> [1] </ref>. Letter alternatives themselves are obtained from the multiple interactive segmentation recognizer, which allows the reuse of partial results. The letter verification can be compared to the word ending postulation [6].

Reference-contexts: It is capable of recognition rates exceeding 90%, as well as rates lower than 30%, depending on the writer.

The method works well in cases where correct segmentation is possible, however it inherently fails for illegible writing.

The method works well in cases where correct segmentation is possible, however it inherently fails for illegible writing. Word ending postulation [6] has been introduced to cope with words becoming illegible towards their endings. Wholistic recognition approach has also been adopted as a more general solution. Where correct segmentation is possible, the multiple interactive segmentation recognizer provides an answer. This answer can be further verified by a wholistic recognizer. <p> Scores obtained both by the vertical bars recognizer and the letter verification are averaged into a single score. 4.2 Lowering computational intensity of the letter verification Due to the nature of the multiple interactive segmentation process and the letter recognizer used by the multiple interactive segmentation <ref> [6] </ref>, the generated graphs of letter alternatives can often be large. As any number of letters can be allowed to be missing, analysing large letter graphs can be computationally intensive. <p> The treatment of letter alternatives as higher level handwriting features is also reported in the results combination literature [1]. Letter alternatives themselves are obtained from the multiple interactive segmentation recognizer, which allows the reuse of partial results. The letter verification can be compared to the word ending postulation <ref> [6] </ref>. However, the word ending postulation is capable of introducing new results alternatives while the letter verification can only filter the already obtained results. The use of the vertical bars recognizer together with the multiple interactive segmentation recognizer in a hybrid system provides a significant improvement of the recognition results.

Reference-contexts: Where correct segmentation is possible, the multiple interactive segmentation recognizer provides an answer. This answer can be further verified by a wholistic recognizer. Where the segmentation fails, the wholistic recognizer is relied upon. An ascender/descender word shape recognizer has been introduced for such a purpose <ref> [7] </ref>. The performance of the ascender/descender recognizer is significantly limited by the accuracy of identification of the ascenders and descenders within the word which depends on the correct estimation of the word zoning. The accuracy of the zoning information extraction is still far from desired [3][7]. <p> The accuracy of the zoning information extraction is still far from desired [3]<ref> [7] </ref>. However, a hybrid system provides an universal improvement [7]. The present paper discusses a new online wholistic recognizer designed for use in a hybrid recognition system, beside the multiple interactive segmentation recognizer. 2 Vertical bars recognizer The vertical bars recognizer uses parts of the pen trajectory where it was moving downwards and approximately vertically. <p> Significant increase in the recognition rate for a larger number of alternatives indicates that the results of the wholistic and hybrid recognizers can be further improved. 6 Discussion The vertical bars recognizer described in this paper is an improvement over the previously reported wholistic recognizer <ref> [7] </ref>. Fuzzy sets are used to represent the position of the vertical bars ends. Hence no zoning classification of vertical bars is necessary. The use of fuzzy sets also allows special treatment of letters with different forms, like f or z.
