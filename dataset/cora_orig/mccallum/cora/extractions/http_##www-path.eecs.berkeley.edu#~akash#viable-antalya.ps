Abstract: Hybrid systems are continuous variable, continuous time systems with a phased operation. Within each phase the system evolves continuously according to the dynamical law of that phase; when an event occurs, the system makes a transition from one phase to the next. In this paper, we study hybrid systems with nondeterministic discrete and continuous behaviors. We use nondeterministic finite automata to model the discrete behavior and state dependent differential inclusions to model the continuous behavior. By viability we mean the system's ability to take an infinite number of discrete transitions. Viability can be used to express safety and fairness properties over the system's state trajectories. To ensure viability, the system's evolution must be restricted so that discrete transitions occur within specific subsets of their enabling conditions. Following Aubin [3], we call these subsets the system's viability kernel. We give results pertaining to certain continuity properties of the viability kernel, we give conditions under which the viability kernel can be computed in a finite number of steps, and we synthesize a hybrid controller that yields all viable trajectories.

Reference-contexts: In section 5 we define the 0-lag nonblocking control strategy. In section 6 we give the hybrid controller synthesis and the conditions under which it yields this strategy. Our approach to viability in hybrid systems is a generalization of Aubin's <ref> [3] </ref> approach to viability in systems described by differential inclusions. In the latter setting, a system is said to be viable if its state remains in a specified subset, called the viability set, of the state space|i.e., the viability set must remain invariant under the system dynamics. <p> First we introduce some notation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the condition of Lemma 7 is sufficient but not necessary. Example 3. Consider the hybrid system H shown in Figure 4. Then 6 To see this, endow the space E fi E fi with the topology of pointwise convergence with the discrete topology on E. By Tychonoff's Theorem <ref> [8] </ref>, this space is compact since E is finite. In this topology, the set of all infinite paths with a common finite prefix is a closed set, and finite unions of such sets are also closed. Evidently, then, each ext (pre (k)) is compact.
