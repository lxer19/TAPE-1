Abstract: In this paper, we present an interactive, case-based approach to crisis response that provides users with the ability to rapidly develop good responses while allowing them to retain ultimate control over the decision-making process. We have implemented this approach in Inca, an INteractive Crisis Assistant for planning and scheduling in crisis domains. Inca relies on case-based methods to seed the response development process with initial candidate solutions drawn from previous cases. The human user then interacts with Inca to adapt these solutions to the current situation. We will discuss this interactive approach to crisis response using an artificial hazardous materials domain, Haz-Mat, that we developed for the purpose of evaluating candidate assistant mechanisms for crisis response.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Crisis response has been the focus of a considerable amount of AI planning and scheduling research. While early systems were predominantly autonomous in nature, more recent systems provide interactive modes that allow human users to retain control of the problem-solving process (e.g., OPLAN-2 (Tate et al., 1994), SO-CAP <ref> (Bienkowski, 1996) </ref>). Like these systems, the interactive crisis assistant we present in this paper allows a serendipitous utilization of human and intelligent systems' strengths.

Reference-contexts: The INteractive Crisis Assistant (Inca) uses case-based methods to seed the interactive response development process with initial candidate solutions drawn from previous cases. Preliminary experiments with Inca support the claim that case-based seeding leads to more rapid development of high-quality solutions <ref> (Gervasio et al., 1998a) </ref>. Here, we focus on a description of the crisis response process with Inca. System Overview with Inca. Given a HazMat incident, Inca retrieves an appropriate case from the case library of previous solutions and performs some initial adaptation. <p> The components of a case may each be viewed as a feature vector, and similarity is determined using a simple count of matching features from a predefined subset. In the pilot study described in <ref> (Gervasio et al., 1998a) </ref>, Inca retrieved the case sharing the most legal actions with the current problem. However, all the components of a case are available for matching. Initial Case Adaptation After the most similar case is retrieved, Inca performs some initial adaptation. <p> Future Work and Conclusions We plan on extending Inca in various directions. Inca currently relies on a case-based reasoning component to seed a collaborative planning and scheduling process with the human user (Figure 2). Preliminary results support the utility of this approach <ref> (Gervasio et al., 1998a) </ref>, and we plan to carry out more extensive experimentation to evaluate the case-base component.

Reference-contexts: Our ultimate goal is an adaptive, interactive crisis response assistant. Inca's interactions with the user provide a ready source of data regarding user preferences. Through the use of inductive learning techniques, Inca can learn user models and adapt its behavior to individual users to further improve efficiency. In <ref> (Gervasio et al., 1998b) </ref>, we show that learning can be used to successfully predict user adaptation operations. We are currently investigating various other learning tasks for the assistant mechanism. In the near future, we plan to fully integrate learning into Inca and evaluate its adaptive capabilities.

Reference-contexts: While these interactive systems aid users in developing so-lutions from scratch, Inca aids users in adapting solutions from previous cases. CLAVIER <ref> (Hinkle & Toomey, 1994) </ref> is an advisory system for autoclave loading that, like Inca, retrieves previous cases for a user who then interacts with the system to perform any additional modifications. Inca differs in its domain and consequent focus on planning and scheduling.

Inca differs in its domain and consequent focus on planning and scheduling. DIAL <ref> (Leake, 1995) </ref> and CHARADE (Perini & Ricci, 1995) are examples of case-based systems for crisis domains. DIAL is an autonomous case-based planner for disaster response. DIAL's adaptation is fully automated, but for the purposes of crisis response, we believe that maintaining user input is crucial.

Reference-contexts: While CHARADE is focused on the development of the initial response, however, we are designing Inca for the continuous development and evaluation of a response to an evolving crisis. In addition, automatic adaptation to different users, using machine learning techniques, will be an integral part of Inca. CABINS <ref> (Miyashita & Sycara, 1995) </ref> is an interactive assistant that uses case-based methods to learn user preferences for job-shop scheduling. CABINS uses a heuristic scheduler to seed the scheduling process and employs case-based methods to learn individual preferences in the form of repair cases.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Crisis response has been the focus of a considerable amount of AI planning and scheduling research. While early systems were predominantly autonomous in nature, more recent systems provide interactive modes that allow human users to retain control of the problem-solving process (e.g., OPLAN-2 <ref> (Tate et al., 1994) </ref>, SO-CAP (Bienkowski, 1996)).

Related Work Many crisis planning and scheduling systems today, including OPLAN-2 <ref> (Tate et al., 1994) </ref> and SOCAP (Bi-enkowski, 1996), have mixed-initiative modes that allow users to control the problem-solving process. While these interactive systems aid users in developing so-lutions from scratch, Inca aids users in adapting solutions from previous cases.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we discuss related work and future work. The Hazardous Materials Domain A hazardous materials incident occurs when a spill of some material with hazardous properties poses a threat to humans, property, or the environment. We developed our artificial world, HazMat, using the North American Emergency Response Guidebook (NAERG) <ref> (Transport Canada et al., 1996) </ref>, a handbook for first responders that describes the appropriate responses for different hazardous materials situations. HAZMAT Problems In HazMat, there are fifty different classes of hazardous materials, varying in form and in hazardous properties.
