Abstract: The multiple instance problem arises in tasks where the training examples are ambiguous: a single example object may have many alternative feature vectors (instances) that describe it, and yet only one of those feature vectors may be responsible for the observed classification of the object. This paper describes and compares three kinds of algorithms that learn axis-parallel rectangles to solve the multiple-instance problem. Algorithms that ignore the multiple instance problem perform very poorly. An algorithm that directly confronts the multiple instance problem (by attempting to identify which feature vectors are responsible for the observed classifications) performs best, giving 89% correct predictions on a musk-odor prediction task. The paper also illustrates the use of artificial data to debug and compare these algorithms.

Reference-contexts: It also was critical in helping us reduce "overfitting" to the real musk data set. Artificial data sets have also proven useful in the development of DNA sequence assembly algorithms [13,32] and in the comparison of learning algorithms <ref> [1] </ref>. We began by constructing a hyper-rectangle that tightly contains all of the data. We then computed the width of the bounds along each ray and plotted the histogram shown in Figure 6. All feature values are measured in hundredths of angstroms ( -A)|centiangstroms (c A).

Reference-contexts: From these 162 rays, 162 feature values are measured. Each feature value is the distance from the origin to the molecule surface. We computed the molecular surface by Connolly's <ref> [7] </ref> method with a probe radius of 1.5 A. In addition to these 162 "shape" features, we also computed four domain-specific features that represented the position of a designated atom (an oxygen atom) on the molecular surface (see below).

Reference-contexts: By observing several molecules (and the resulting fragments), Meta-DENDRAL was able to formulate a small number of bond-breakage rules that accounted for the observed fragments. A similar situation arises in explanation-based learning with a "promiscuous" domain theory <ref> [10] </ref>. Given an input example, the domain theory can construct multiple explanations that account for the observed result. The learning task is to examine several training examples and find one explanation that can account for all of the observed results.

In comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, Jain, Koile, Bauer & Chapman [22] show that dynamic reposing permits more accurate and robust activity predictions.

Reference-contexts: A simple algorithm can be designed by analogy with the standard algorithm for learning boolean conjunctions <ref> [12] </ref>. We simply construct the APR that exactly covers all of the positive feature vectors (the "all-positive" APR). This is the maximally-specific conjunctive generalization of the positive instances. We will call this algorithm the "all-positive APR" algorithm. of the unfilled points. However, this APR treats every feature as relevant.

Reference-contexts: We can see that the preponderance of the bounds are testing the shape of the end of the molecule opposite the oxygen atom. This is a region of hydrophobic "bulk", and previous chemical studies had also emphasized the importance of this region for musk activity <ref> [14] </ref>. There is also a notable absence of any APR bounds on the middle left side of the molecule, which suggests that the molecules have some shape freedom in this area.

Reference-contexts: The backfitting algorithm, which is an extension of the greedy procedure, was first employed in the Projection Pursuit method <ref> [15] </ref>. It begins like the greedy algorithm by choosing a seed positive instance and then taking a series of greedy steps. However, after each greedy step, it revisits all previous decisions to consider whether they would be made differently.

Reference-contexts: Peak performance of 91.2% is attained for any of the following parameter values: (t = 0:99, * = 0:012), (t = 0:99, * = 0:014), and (t = 0:995, * = 0:008).

Reference-contexts: If chemists could obtain a three dimensional model of the requirements for drug activity, they would be able to design better drugs. Sometimes the shape of the binding site can be inferred from X-ray crystallography and used to guide drug design <ref> [25] </ref>. In many practical cases, however, the shape of the binding site is unknown, and machine learning methods might be able to provide a three dimensional shape hypothesis to support drug design. Such "rational" drug design could cut years off the time required to discover new drugs.

We used gaussians with a standard deviation of 10c A. From Figure 9 we can see that the distribution of positive and negative examples is very similar. It appears that we could separate a few negatives from the positives by placing a bound at 330.

Reference-contexts: Previous research in drug activity prediction has 8 attempted to use such representations (e.g., notably methods derived from the work of Hansch [17,18], and some success has been reported for simple molecules or for families of molecules having large amounts of shared structure <ref> [34] </ref>). For diverse molecules of the type studied in this paper, these methods have not been very successful [4]. Another approach is to employ a shape-oriented representation, but to attempt to guess in advance which conformation of each molecule is the biologically-active one.
