Abstract: Database systems for real-time applications must satisfy timing constraints associated with transactions, in addition to maintaining data consistency. In addition to real-time requirements, security is usually required in many applications. Multilevel security requirements introduce a new dimension to transaction processing in real-time database systems. In this paper, we argue that due to the conflicting goals of each requirement, trade-offs need to be made between security and timeliness. We first define capacity, a measure of the degree to which security is being satisfied by a system. A secure two-phase locking protocol is then described and a scheme is proposed to allow partial violations of security for improved timeliness. The capacity of the resultant covert channel is derived and a feedback control scheme is proposed that does not allow the capacity to exceed a specified upper bound.

The probability q 2 depends on the factors capacity (C) and q 1 . C is available directly, but q 1 is calculated based on the arrival rate of transactions, the probability of contention, and their deadlines.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Database security is concerned with the ability of a database management system to enforce a security policy governing the disclosure, modification or destruction of information. Most secure database systems use an access control mechanism based on the Bell-LaPadula model <ref> [2] </ref>. This model is stated in terms of subjects and objects. An object is understood to be a data file, record or a field within a record. A subject is an active process that requests access to objects. Every object is assigned a classification and every subject a clearance.

Reference-contexts: In multilevel secure databases, there is the additional problem of maintaining consistency without introducing covert channels. For a more detailed description of and a possible solution to the problem of concurrency control in secure databases, the reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, we concern ourselves with concurrency control mechanisms that have to satisfy both security and real-time requirements. We advance our claim that conflicts between these two requirements are inherent and hence tradeoffs between them are necessary. <p> A real-time secure concurrency control must possess two characteristics speed and minimal deadline miss percentage. The secure two phase locking protocol <ref> [3] </ref> was shown to yield best average case performance among all the secure concurrency control approaches whose performance was evaluated in [16]. We therefore use it as a basis for our solution to the problem of real-time secure concurrency control. <p> From the correctness criteria for secure sched-ulers, covert channels can be broadly classified into three categories | those that communicate information through a violation of delay security, those that violate recovery security and those that violate value security. In <ref> [3] </ref>, it is proved that Secure 2PL satisfies delay security. Our real-time secure concurrency control mechanism explained in Section 6 is based on the Secure 2PL protocol.

Reference-contexts: The notion of non-interference has been proposed <ref> [4] </ref> as a simple and intuitively satisfying definition of what it means for a system to be secure. The property of non-interference states that the output as seen by a subject must be unaffected by the inputs of another subject at a higher access class.

Reference-contexts: means that a subject at a lower access class should not be able to distinguish between the outputs from the system in response to an input sequence including actions from a higher level subject and an input sequence in which all inputs at a higher access class have been removed <ref> [6] </ref>. An extensive analysis of the possible covert channels in a secure concurrency control mechanism and the necessary and sufficient conditions for a secure, interference-free scheduler are given in [6]. Three of these properties are of relevance to the secure two phase locking protocol discussed in this paper. <p> from a higher level subject and an input sequence in which all inputs at a higher access class have been removed <ref> [6] </ref>.

Three of these properties are of relevance to the secure two phase locking protocol discussed in this paper. <p> Even these schedulers, however, can reach a state from which they cannot continue without aborting one or more transactions. For simplicity, these two conditions are lumped together and called as deadlock <ref> [6] </ref>. When a deadlock is detected, some of the actions in the schedule must be aborted, allowing the others to proceed. <p> All existing real-time systems schedule transactions based on some priority scheme. The priority usually reflects how close the transaction is to missing its deadline. Priority-based scheduling of real-time transactions, however, interacts with the property of non-interference which has to be satisfied by secure schedulers <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Bell-LaPadula model prevents direct flow of information from a higher access class to a lower access class, but the conditions are not sufficient to ensure that security is not violated indirectly through what are known as covert channels <ref> [7] </ref>. A covert channel allows indirect transfer of information from a subject at a higher access class to a subject at a lower access class. <p> We shall also look at the correctness criteria that must be satisfied by schedulers that are free from covert channels. 2.1 Covert Channels and Capacity The systematic study of covert channels began with <ref> [7] </ref>. As an example of a simple covert channel consider two processes running on a system that schedules them alternately for exactly one or two time quanta each, the choice being up to the process [9].

Reference-contexts: The goal of the analysis is to show the variation in miss percentage for varying capacity of the covert channel. 8.1 Simulation Model Central to the simulation model is a single-site disk resident database system operating on shared-memory multiprocessors <ref> [8] </ref>. The system consists of a disk-based database and a main memory cache. The unit of database granularity is the page. When a transaction needs to perform an operation on a data item it accesses a page.

Reference-contexts: As an example of a simple covert channel consider two processes running on a system that schedules them alternately for exactly one or two time quanta each, the choice being up to the process <ref> [9] </ref>. One process (the sender) may send information covertly to the other (receiver) by encoding successive bits in the amount of time taken for its execution.

Reference-contexts: This could eliminate the need for raising an ERROR condition when the desired miss percentage is exceeded, since the correct setting of q 2 can be obtained mathematically from capacity and desired miss percentage. Secondly, in <ref> [11] </ref> the use of capacity as a measure of security is questioned. Examples of zero capacity channels are provided, where short messages can be sent through without any errors (or loss in fidelity).

Reference-contexts: The presence of noise decreases the information rate. Covert channel analysis is just a subset of information theory, which is concerned with sending signals from a transmitter to a receiver, with the possibility of noise degrading the signal fidelity. Shannon's pioneering work <ref> [13] </ref> gives an upper limit on the rate at which messages can be passed through the communication channel based solely on how noise affects the transmission of signals. This upper limit is referred to as the capacity of the channel.

Reference-contexts: There have been a number of papers in the real-time databases literature that have explored priority based scheduling approaches with respect to conventional databases [1],[12], <ref> [14] </ref>. The problem arises when these approaches are applied to secure databases, because covert channels can be introduced by priority based scheduling. All existing real-time systems schedule transactions based on some priority scheme. The priority usually reflects how close the transaction is to missing its deadline. <p> This idea is adapted from <ref> [14] </ref>, where before cnt and after cnt are used to dynamically adjust the serialization order of transactions.

Reference-contexts: As advances in multilevel security take place, MLS/DBMSs are also required to support real-time requirements. As more and more of such systems are in use, one cannot avoid the need for integrating real-time transaction processing techniques into MLS/DBMSs. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the security impact on real-time database systems is studied, but to the best of our knowledge, no work has been reported on developing DBMSs that are multilevel secure and that support real-time requirements.

Reference-contexts: A real-time secure concurrency control must possess two characteristics speed and minimal deadline miss percentage. The secure two phase locking protocol [3] was shown to yield best average case performance among all the secure concurrency control approaches whose performance was evaluated in <ref> [16] </ref>. We therefore use it as a basis for our solution to the problem of real-time secure concurrency control. From our discussion earlier in this paper, it is clear that priority based transaction scheduling is not feasible for a fully secure database system. <p> There is no direct mathematical relationship between the deadline miss percentage and q 1 and q 2 . However, the performance results discussed in <ref> [16] </ref> indicate that with increasing arrival rate (and therefore q 1 ), the deadline miss percentage increases slowly but steadily up to a certain point, after which the system becomes unstable.
