Abstract: We introduce the contour spectrum, a user interface component that improves qualitative user interaction and provides real-time exact quantification in the visualization of isocontours. The contour spectrum is a signature consisting of a variety of scalar data and contour attributes, computed over the range of scalar values w 2 &lt;. We explore the use of surface area, volume, and gradient integral of the contour that are shown to be univariate B-spline functions of the scalar value w for multi-dimensional unstructured triangular grids. These quantitative properties are calculated in real-time and presented to the user as a collection of signature graphs (plots of functions of w) to assist in selecting relevant isovalues w 0 for informative visualization. For time-varying data, these quantitative properties can also be computed over time, and displayed using a 2D interface, giving the user an overview of the time-varying function, and allowing interaction in both isovalue and timestep. The effectiveness of the current system and potential extensions are discussed.

In visualization of isocontours, a simple and common approach is to select a set of isovalues w 0 which are evenly spaced throughout the range w of the function. It is clear that such a technique is prone to miss features which may be considered important.

Reference-contexts: it is know from spline theory that given a d-simplex in &lt; d the function that gives the measure of all the parallel slices of such simplex (that is the measure of the intersection with a set of parallel hyperplanes) is a degree d1, C d2 continuous, polynomial B-spline function <ref> [5] </ref>. Scalar fields of arbitrary topology meshes can of course be handled by first generating simplicial approximation of them. Note that in constructing a simplicial approximation for structured and convex cell topology meshes, no new data values are needed for the scalar field.
