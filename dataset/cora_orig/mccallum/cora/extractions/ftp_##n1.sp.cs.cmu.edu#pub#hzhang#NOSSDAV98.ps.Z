Abstract: In this paper, we study the Assured Service model proposed by Clark and Wroclawski [3, 4]. While existing schemes use service profiles that are defined in terms of absolute bandwidth, it is difficult, if not impossible, to design provisioning algorithms that achieve simultaneously good service quality and high resource utilization for such services with large spatial granularities. We propose an Assured Service model, called LIRA (Location Independent Resource Accounting), in which service profiles are defined in units of resource tokens, rather than absolute bandwidth. The number of resource tokens charged for each in-profile packet is a dynamic function of the path it traverses and the congestion level. Defining service profile in terms of resource tokens allows more dynamic and flexible network control algorithms that can simultaneously achieve high utilization and ensure high probability delivery of in-profile packets. We present an integrated set of algorithms that implement the model. Specifically, we leverage the existing routing infrastructure to distribute the path costs to all edge nodes. Since the path cost reflects the congestion level along the path, we use this cost to design dynamic routing and load balancing algorithms. To avoid packet re-ordering within a flow, we devise a lightweight mechanism that binds a flow to a route so that all packets from the flow will traverse the same route. To reduce route oscillation, we probabilistically bind a flow to one of the multiple routes. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

No mechanisms are given to propagate this information to the users.

The time interval between two route updates is uniformly distributed between 0:5 and 1:5 of the average value. As shown in <ref> [10] </ref> this choice avoids the route-update self-synchronization. In SPF, when a node receives a routing message, it first updates its routing table and then forwards the message to all its neighbors, excepting the sender. The routing messages are assumed to have high priority, so they are never lost.

Since our algorithm works in the context of one ISP, we can maintain an entry for each egress node instead of each destination. We believe this is sufficient as the number of egress nodes in an ISP is usually not large.

Reference-contexts: As we will show in Section 3, charging a user for every link it uses and using the cost in routing decisions help to increase the network throughput. In fact, it has been shown in <ref> [19] </ref> that using a similar cost function 2 for performing the shortest path routing gives the best overall results when compared with other dynamic routing algorithms. It is important to note that the costs used in this paper are not monetary in nature. <p> Oth erwise, depending on the policy, the packet can be either 2 It can be shown that when all links have the same capacity our cost is within a constant factor from the cost of shortest-dist (P, 1) algorithm proposed in <ref> [19] </ref>. dropped, or treated as best effort. Informally, our goal at the user level is to ensure that users with similar communication patterns receive service (in terms of aggregate marked traffic) in proportion to their token rates. <p> Second, at least for the topologies and the traffic model considered in these experiments, our scheme ensures that marked packets are delivered to the destination with high probability. Consistent with other studies <ref> [19] </ref>, these experiments show that performing dynamic routing and load balancing make little sense when the load is already balanced. In fact, doing dynamic routing and load balancing can actually hurt, since, as noted above, this will generate longer routes which may result in inefficient resource utilization. <p> Also we alleviate the problem of system stability which plagued many of the previous dynamic routing algorithms by defining a more robust cost function and probabilistically binding a flow to a route. We also note that our link cost is similar to the one used in <ref> [19] </ref>. In particular, it can be shown that when all links have the same capacity, our link cost is within a constant factor of the cost of shortest-dist (P, 1) algorithm presented in [19]. <p> We also note that our link cost is similar to the one used in <ref> [19] </ref>. In particular, it can be shown that when all links have the same capacity, our link cost is within a constant factor of the cost of shortest-dist (P, 1) algorithm presented in [19]. It is worth noting that shortest-dist (P, 1) performed the best among all the algorithms studied in [19]. 6 Summary We study models and algorithms that support Assured Service with service profiles defined over large spatial gran-ularities. <p> In particular, it can be shown that when all links have the same capacity, our link cost is within a constant factor of the cost of shortest-dist (P, 1) algorithm presented in <ref> [19] </ref>.

At each congested link along a path a cutoff price is computed and only packets that have a higher bid are forwarded; the other packets are buffered. At the service level it is unclear how the priorities of individual packets translate into expected network throughput.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As the Internet evolves into a global commercial infrastructure, there is a growing need to support more enhanced services than the traditional best-effort service. To address this issue, several new QoS models (guaranteed, controlled load, committed rate) have been proposed <ref> [26, 31] </ref>. Collectively, they are called Integrated Services or Intserv models. Recently, there are new efforts in the IETF to develop a new class of service models called Differential Services or Diff-serv models [2, 3, 4, 17, 22, 29].

Reference-contexts: Such difference at the service level has important implications on the complexity of the network-level mechanisms required to implement these services. In particular, to provide Intserv, each router needs to support a flow level signaling protocol such as RSVP <ref> [32] </ref>, maintain per flow state, and perform scheduling and manage buffers on a per flow basis. Since there can be a large number of 1 flows in the Internet, it is an open question whether Intserv can be implemented in a scalable fashion.
