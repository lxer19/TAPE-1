Title: Wiretap: An Experimental Multiple-Path Routing Algorithm  
Author: ,, David L. Mills 
Keyword: adaptive routing, diversity routing, packet radio, Viterbi algorithm  
Affiliation: Electrical Engineering Department University of Delaware  
Abstract: This paper introduces Wiretap, an experimental routing algorithm which computes maximum-likelihood diversity routes for packet-radio stations sharing a common broadcast channel, but with some stations hidden from others. The wiretapper observes the paths (source routes) used by other stations sending traffic on the channel and, using a heuristic set of factors and weights, constructs speculative paths for its own traffic. The algorithm is presented as an example of maximum-likelihood routing and database management techniques useful for richly connected networks of mobile stations. Of particular interest are the mechanisms to compute, select, rank and cache a potentially large number of speculative routes when only limited computational resources are available. A prototype implementation has been constructed and tested for the AX.25 packet-radio channel now in widespread use in the amateur-radio community. Its design is similar in many respects to the SPF algorithm used in the ARPANET and NSFNET backbone networks, and is in fact a variation of the Viterbi algorithm, which constructs maximum-likelihood paths on a graph according to a weighted sum of factors assigned to the nodes and edges.

Reference-contexts: The Wiretap algorithm is similar in function to the shortest-path-first (SPF) routing algorithms used in the ARPANET and NSFNET backbone networks [4] and to the routing algorithms used in other packet-radio systems <ref> [1] </ref>, but is specifically intended to produce multiple paths based on real-time measured characteristics of the channel itself. <p> Construction continues until all the complete paths satisfying a specified condition are found, following which as in <ref> [1] </ref> the primary route is selected from among the minimum-distance paths and the alternate routes selected in order of increasing distance of the remaining paths. The routing procedure operates using a linked list of entries derived from the link table. <p> The Wiretap routing algorithm can be compared to the Tier algorithm developed for the DARPA Survivable Radio Network (SURAN) program <ref> [1] </ref>, which is a variant of the Bellman-Ford algorithm described in [6]. The Tier algorithm is designed to operate in a distributed manner where each station broadcasts a routing vector to its neighbors on a periodic or event-triggered basis. <p> The routing metric is based on hop count and station number (to avoid loops), and with primary and alternate routes ranked as in Wiretap. As described in <ref> [1] </ref> the Tier metric includes neither the link factor computations and weights nor the pruning techniques to control computational overheads as mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: Wiretap operates in real time using passive monitoring of AX.25 frames transmitted on the channel and builds a dynamic database which can be used to construct a set of paths ordered by decreasing likelihood, as determined by a technique based on the Viterbi algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Thus, the probability of a non-looping path is the product of the probabilities of its links. Following the technique of Viterbi <ref> [2] </ref>, it is convenient to represent distance as a logarithmic transformation of probability; however, in Wiretap the underlying probabilities are not determined directly, but estimated on a heuristic basis. <p> Ordinarily, this needs to be done only when the first frame to a new destination is sent and at regular intervals thereafter (in future the intervals may be modulated by congestion thresholds, etc.). The technique used is a variation of the Viterbi algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, which operates by constructing a set of candidate paths (survivors) on the network graph from the destination to the source in increasing number of hops.
