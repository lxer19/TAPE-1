Abstract: The purpose of this note is to present a new sampling technique and to demonstrate some of its properties. The new technique consists of picking two elements at random, and deterministically generating (from them) a long sequence of pairwise independent elements. The sequence is guarantees to intersect, with high probability, any set of non-negligible density.

Reference-contexts: Shamir, only L 3 bit sequences are possible. (The effect is best examplified by considering L = 2 log p. In this case there are only O (log 3 p) sequences, while the obvious upper bound is p 2 .) Furthermore, as pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref>, the sequence of b i 's can be predicted with high probability ( 1 L * ), when knowing (1 + 2*) log L bits of x; y. (One needs only to know the least significant bits of both x and y, the * log L most significant bits of <p> know the least significant bits of both x and y, the * log L most significant bits of x, and the (1 + *) log L most significant bits of y.) The fact that the b i 's can be predicted with very high probability plays a central role in <ref> [2] </ref>. Chronological Remark The construction presented in section 3 was first discoved by us in April 1984 [10]. About half a year later, we found out that the construction (but not the application) had been presented by Joffe [12] in 1971 to a Probability Theory conference*.

(The same implemetation was discovered independently by Anderson [5] and Beame [6].) First note that U can be embedded in a finite field whose size is not significantly larger than jU j. Thus, without loss of generality, U is a finite field.

Reference-contexts: Concluding Remarks Our method can be viewed as "expanding randomness" for sampling purposes, without using any unproven assumptions. A much more general method for "expanding randomness" was presented by Blum and Micali <ref> [7] </ref> and Yao [22]. Under the assumption that 1-1 one-way functions exist it is possible to expand n truly random coin tosses into poly (n) pseudo-random coin tosses that are good with respect to any polynomial-time algorithm.
