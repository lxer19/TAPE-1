Reference-contexts: Existing field-programmable hardwares are often aimed at system prototyping [13], logic emulation [6][15], experimental applications [1][2] and low-volume military applications <ref> [4] </ref> in which size and power issues were not necessary critical. 3. The programming of the field-programmable hardware should be easy enough for the application developers to handle. This requires the support for high-level design capture without the need for digi tal system design skills. 4.

Reference-contexts: Generated netlist is partitioned into 12 groups so that each group fits in one XC3042 FPGA. Partitioning algorithm is based on the classical min-cut bipartition heuristic for multiple-pin nets by Fiduccia and Mattheyses <ref> [9] </ref>. After partitioning, the pipelines have to be further synchronized since any partitioned net introduces one additional delay. This part of re-synchronization has not been implemented yet, therefore the result on the two tables may be subjected to a minor change when it is actually imple mented. 4.

Reference-contexts: And since the parasitic capacitance is significantly lower compared to on-board communications, fast drivers can be built in the die. AT&T Bell Laboratory has designed a set of low voltage, high-speed IO buffers optimized specifically for MCM which can operate at up to 400MHz <ref> [10] </ref>. 2.3 FPMCM-I Architecture We have designed and fabricated the first generation FPMCM (FPMCM-I) [7][8], and the board for testing the assembled modules and also running various applications is being developed.

Reference-contexts: Each module is composed of a single or multiple cells where each cell contains several combinational logics implementing single bit function plus several storage elements. We have designed some bit-serial modules on Xilinx XC3000 architecture (Fig.4, Fig.5) <ref> [12] </ref>. These modules can be pipelined to perform complex operations. In fact, any given algorithm can be mapped onto a network of pipelines of bit-serial circuits. The data sampling rate is N clock cycles where N is the word length.

Reference-contexts: In the first part of our paper, we will briefly decribe our work on Field-Programmable Multi-Chip Module (FPMCM). The last two problems have long been one of the central issue in researches concerning FPGA. The development of High-Level Synthesis in ASIC-DSP community <ref> [14] </ref> cannot simply be applied to the datapath designs on FPGA. Since the routing resource and logic resource are physically fixed, it is often hard to control or even predict the outcome of the layout synthesis on FPGA.
