Abstract: We study a multivariate smoothing spline estimate of a function of several variables, based on an ANOVA decomposition as sums of main effect functions (of one variable), two-factor interaction functions (of two variables), etc. We derive the Bayesian "confidence intervals" for the components of this decomposition and demonstrate that, even with multiple smoothing parameters, they can be efficiently computed using the publicly available code RKPACK, which was originally designed just to compute the estimates. We carry out a small Monte Carlo study to see how closely the actual properties of these component-wise confidence intervals match their nominal confidence levels. Lastly, we analyze some lake acidity data as a function of calcium concentration, latitude, and longitude, using both polynomial and thin plate spline main effects in the same model.

Reference-contexts: An overview of SS-ANOVA as it applies to polynomial splines and tensor products of polynomial splines can be found in Wahba (1990). More recently this framework has been generalized to show how to include thin plate splines in an SS-ANOVA model <ref> (Gu and Wahba, 1991a, 1993) </ref>. The use of thin plate splines as part of the SS-ANOVA model allows the modeling of geographic and other variables as variables in main effects, interaction terms, and so forth. In SS-ANOVA (and other ANOVA in function space approaches, see, e.g.
