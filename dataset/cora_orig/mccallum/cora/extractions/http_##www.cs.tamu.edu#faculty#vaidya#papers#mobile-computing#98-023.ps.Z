Abstract: Location-Aided Routing (LAR) [14] algorithm is an approach to utilize location information for mobile hosts, with the goal of decreasing routing-related overhead in mobile ad hoc networks. A number of optimizations are possible to improve performance of the basic LAR protocols. This paper mainly focuses how the basic operation of LAR can be improved by applying those optimization schemes.

Reference-contexts: also suggested using directional antennas for packet radio networks [16, 21, 24]. 7 Most of previous MANET routing algorithms assume (implicitly or explicitly) use of omnidirectional antennas even though MANET nodes can be equipped with wireless transmitters and receivers either using omnidirectional antennas (broadcast) or using highly directional antennas (point-to-point) <ref> [3] </ref>. In fact, the main reason why those protocols usually assume omnidirectional antennas is because they cannot specify the direction in which routing request packets need to be transmitted. <p> However, the basic LAR approach is still limited in a sense due to the broadcast propagating nature of mobile ad hoc networks. In general, MANET nodes are assumed to have omnidirectional antennas for wireless communication <ref> [3] </ref>. This assumption implies that any request message broadcast by a node will reach all its neighbors, even if some of these neighbors are outside the intended request zone. This may be improved upon by using directed antennas.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, when applying directional antennas to mobile communications, new problems occur: for instance, multiple access protocols with omnidirectional antennas should be redesigned since with directional antennas the beam can only be directed at a subset of neighbors <ref> [7] </ref>. Some researchers have already suggested use of directional antennas for a packet radio system consisting of a base station and a number of mobile users. <p> More recently, a way of using adaptive directed antennas for the Mobile Broadband System (MBS) has been proposed <ref> [7] </ref>. In [7], to apply directional antennas to mobile communications, they pointed out that a mobile station's direction needs to be tracking precisely so that the base station can direct the beam at the mobile station with sufficient precision. <p> More recently, a way of using adaptive directed antennas for the Mobile Broadband System (MBS) has been proposed <ref> [7] </ref>.

Similarly, a node may propagate to other nodes its average speed (or some other measure of speed). 3.5 Combining with Time-to-Live (TTL) In DSR <ref> [9] </ref>, route discovery using expanding ring search has been suggested as one optimization over flooding. In this approach, a source initially sends a route request with setting its time-to 6 live (TTL) field to 1.
