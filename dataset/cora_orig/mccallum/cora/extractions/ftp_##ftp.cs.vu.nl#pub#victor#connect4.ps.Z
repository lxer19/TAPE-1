Abstract: A Shannon C-type strategy program, VICTOR, is written for Connect-Four, based on nine strategic rules. Each of these rules is proven to be correct, implying that conclusions made by VICTOR are correct. Using VICTOR, strategic rules where found which can be used by Black to at least draw the game, on each 7 (2n) board, provided that White does not start at the middle column, as well as on any 6 (2n) board. 333333333333333333 Published in 1988 as Report IR-163 by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Reference-contexts: To see this, we have to consider the number of positions which must be stored at the same time, when we build the database. When a retrograde analysis is applied, as has been done for many endgames in chess <ref> [5] </ref>, we need not necessarily store the positions consisting of, say, 20 men, as long as we have not yet determined the value of all positions of 21 men. When we have determined the value of these positions, we no longer need the positions consisting of 22 men or more.

Reference-contexts: The whole game is shown in diagram 2.5: l l l l l l Diagram 2.5. This game shows that the four strategic rules do not always assure that the best result possible (draw) can be reached, although the rules look perfectly reasonable. This example is due to <ref> [6] </ref>. For this reason we must make clear what the differences are between the four strategic rules for - 15 - tic-tac-toe and the rules used in this article concerning Connect-Four.

Reference-contexts: Recently, McAl-lester suggested a new search method in minimax trees. This new method is called conspiracy-number search. In this section we will consider only the simple form of conspiracy-number search which has been used for our Connect-Four program. More general descriptions of conspiracy-number search can be found in <ref> [7] </ref> and [8].

More general descriptions of conspiracy-number search can be found in [7] and <ref> [8] </ref>. In the next sections we will use different values for the possible results of the evaluation function. -1 is used to mean that Black can at least draw the game, 0 means that a position is still unclear, while the value 1 indicates that White can win the game.
