Abstract: The problem of enhancing a database management system (DBMS) to support mining applications is twofold. First DBMSs of today have limited functionality for supporting mining applications. Second scaling traditional knowledge discovery techniques for large data sets is not straightforward. We propose a mining kernel that could be incorporated into future DBMSs. The mining kernel provides a common knowledge base encapsulated by a complete set of knowledge management operators such that interactive modules for database mining applications can be built on top of it. The novelty of our approach is to study how the concept-based retrieval, relevance feedback, and information dissemination techniques used in intelligent information retrieval systems relate to each other and to apply the result of this study to the database mining problem.

Reference-contexts: This design choice is motivated by the fact that a concept based system is an area of investigation in its own right; that is, it is not affected by particular data analysis methods if a common knowledge base is used. This is in contrast to EXIS <ref> [8] </ref> which makes the assumption that knowledge discovery is based on some specific methods. Our approach is similar to INLEN system [9], which clearly differentiates Knowledge Management Operators (KMOs) from Knowledge Generation Operators (KGOs); however, it organizes the KMOs around KGOs. This paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the DBMS should offer some facilities (e.g., daemon processes for if-condition-then-fire triggers) to support dynamic rules. 3 The Representation and Organization of Concepts We have used the language of predicate logic to represent concepts and a reader not familiar with basic notations of this mathematical discipline may refer to <ref> [10] </ref>. Let W be a vocabulary. For each symbol t W , we assume there is an integer d ( )t called the degree of t. For t a function symbol, d ( )t 0, while for t a relation symbol, d ( )t &gt; 0.

In particular, we provide subsystems to organize persistent concepts into a hierarchy and to enable users to perform a variety of operations on the conceptset structure.
