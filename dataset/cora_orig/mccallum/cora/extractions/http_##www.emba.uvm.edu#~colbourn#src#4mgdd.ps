Reference-contexts: Develop the blocks under Z 57 . 2 Lemma 2.5 There is a 4-MGDD of type 6 25 . 4 Proof: There is a 4-IGDD of type (36; 6; 6; 6; 6; 6; 6) 4 , which is a holey transver-sal design T D (4; 36)6TD (4; 6) <ref> [1] </ref>. Add six points and fill groups using a 4-MGDD of type 6 7 . 2 Lemma 2.6 There is a 4-MGDD of type 6 31 . Proof: Let V = Z 93 fi f0; 1g. <p> Lemma 2.10 If g 1 (mod 6), g 43, there exists a 4-MGDD of type 6 g . Proof: When m is odd and m 7, there exists a TD (7; m) with the possible exceptions of m = 15; 39 <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Lemma 2.12 There are 4-MGDDs of type 6 28 and 6 40 . Proof: There exist 4-HTDs of type 7 6 and 10 6 <ref> [1] </ref>. Apply Lemma 2.8. 2 Lemma 2.13 There exists a 4-MGDD of type 6 34 . Proof: Start with a 3-GDD of type 6 6 , whose blocks can be partitioned into frame parallel classes. <p> Use 4-MGDDs of types 6 7 and 6 10 to fill groups. 2 Lemma 2.14 If m 63, there exists a 4-MGDD of type (6m + 10) 6 . Proof: A TD (7; m) exists for all m 63 <ref> [1] </ref>. Apply Lemma 2.9 with a = 3 to obtain a 4-MGDD of type (6m + 10) 6 , using the 4-MGDD of type 6 10 from Lemma 2.2. 2 Lemma 2.15 Let g 4 (mod 6). <p> Proof: Lemma 2.14 handles all cases when g &gt; 382. Now apply Lemma 2.9 with a = 3 and values of m 62 for which a TD (7,m) exists <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 6 Lemma 2.16 If g 52 and g 6= 70; 118, then there is a 4-MGDD of type g 6 . Proof: First apply Lemma 2.15.

We then settle the existence of 4-MGDDs with index greater than one completely. 2 Main Constructions Before we proceed, we need some direct constructions. Lemma 2.1 <ref> [4] </ref> There is a 4-MGDD of type 6 7 . Proof: Let V = Z 21 fi f0; 1g. A parallel class is G 1 = f (3i; j) : i = 0; 1; : : : ; 6g for j = 0; 1 and their translates. <p> The second parallel class is f (7i; j) : i = 0; 1; 2; j = 0; 1g and its translates. The base blocks are: f (0,0),(1,0),(5,0),(2,1)g, f (0,0),(6,1),(17,1),(19,1)g, f (0,0),(2,0),(10,1),(15,1)g, Develop these under Z 21 to obtain the blocks of the 4-MGDD. 2 Lemma 2.2 <ref> [4] </ref> There is a 4-MGDD of type 6 10 . Proof: Let V = Z 5 fi Z 10 [ H 10 , where H 10 = fh 0 ; h 1 ; : : : ; h 9 g. <p> The second parallel class is f13i : i = 0; 1; : : : ; 5g and its translates. The base blocks are f0,1,3,10g, f0,4,27,38g, f0,5,25,33g, f0,14,29,61g, f0,16,35,57g. Develop these blocks over Z 78 . 2 Lemma 2.4 <ref> [4] </ref> There is a 4-MGDD of type 6 19 . Proof: Let V = Z 57 fif0; 1g. The first parallel class is f (3i; j) : i = 0; 1; : : : ; 18g for j = 0; 1 and their translates. <p> Finally, we combine Lemmas 2.11 and 2.20 to yield: Theorem 2.21 There is a 4-MGDD of type 6 n for all n 62 f16; 22g, n 1 (mod 3) and n 7. In addition, we update the theorem of Assaf and Wei <ref> [4] </ref>. Lemma 2.22 There is a 4-MGDD of type 10 8 . 7 Proof: Let V = Z 10 fi (Z 7 [ f1g). The first parallel class is ffig fi (Z 7 [ f1g) : i 2 Z 10 g. <p> n 4, except when = 1 and fm; ng = f6; 4g, and possibly when = 1 and fm; ng 2 ff6; 16g; f6; 22g; f10; 15g; f10; 18gg. 13 Acknowledgments Thanks to Ron Mullin and two anonymous referees for useful suggestions, and to Ahmed Assaf for the preprint of <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is a f7g-PBD of index 3 and order 15. There is a f4,10g-PBD 10 of index 3 and order 11. There are f4,7g-PBDs of index 3 and orders 14, 18, and 23. Proof: For the first two statements, see <ref> [7] </ref>. For order 11, employ base blocks f0; 1; 5; 7g and f1; 0; 1; 3g over Z 10 [ f1g, together with Z 10 as a block of size 10.

Reference-contexts: For every block in the parallel class, put a 4-MGDD of type (k + 1) 6 (k = 6; 9) on the corresponding points together with the new adjoined points. For every other block, put a 4-GDD of type 6 6 or 6 5 9 1 <ref> [9] </ref>. This gives a 4-MGDD of type 6 46 . 2 Lemma 2.18 There exists a 4-MGDD of type 6 70 . Proof: Take a 4-MGDD of type 7 6 (Lemma 2.1) and give every point weight 10. <p> Give every point weight nine and append a new column of six points. For every block of size 6, employ a 4- MGDD of type 10 6 (Lemma 2.2). For every other block of size four, employ with a 4-GDD of type 9 4 <ref> [9] </ref>. This gives a 4-MGDD of type 6 118 . 2 Combining Lemmas 2.12, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 2.19, we have the following result. Lemma 2.20 If g 4 (mod 6), g 6= 4; 16; 22, there exists a 4-MGDD of type 6 g .

Reference-contexts: Develop these blocks over Z 19 fi Z 11 . 2 Lemma 2.25 There is a 4-MGDD of type 19 12 . Proof: Take a 5-MGDD of type 6 13 <ref> [10] </ref> and remove a group of size six to obtain a f4; 5g-MGDD of type 6 12 . Give weight three to each point and append a new column of 12 points.

Reference-contexts: Base blocks are: f (0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)g, f (0,1),(1,1),(5,0),(9,4)g, f (0,1),(2,2),(8,0),(6,4)g. Multiply each by (4; 1) i for i = 0; 1; 2; 3; 4 to obtain 15 base blocks, and develop over the group. For m = 12, there is a 5-MGDD of type 6 13 <ref> [11] </ref> and hence a f4,5g-MGDD of type 6 12 . Triplicate each block of size 4, and replace each 5-block by a f4g-PBD of order 5 and index 3. For m = 14, the point set is (Z 13 [ f1g) fi (Z 5 [ f1g).
