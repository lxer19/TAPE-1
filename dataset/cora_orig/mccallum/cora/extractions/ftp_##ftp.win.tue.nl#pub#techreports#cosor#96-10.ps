Abstract: A general setting is developed which describes controlled invariance for nonlinear control systems and which incorporates the previous approaches dealing with controlled invariant (co -) distributions. A special class of controlled invariant subspaces, called controllability cospaces, is introduced. These geometric notions are shown to be useful for deriving a (geometric) solution to the dynamic disturbance decoupling problem and for characterizing the so-called fixed dynamics for noninteracting control. These fixed dynamics are a central issue in studying noninteracting control with stability. The class of quasi-static state feedbacks is used.

Reference-contexts: We will write _ fi for fi (1) . Definition 3.5 A subspace ae X is said to be controlled invariant for (1) if there exists a quasi-static state feedback (8) such that for (1,8) one has <ref> [1] </ref> ae + V (13) The definition of controlled invariance given in Definition 3.5 is in accordance with the well known definition of a controlled invariant codistribution. <p> Recall from e.g. [29],[38] that a codistribution is controlled invariant if there exists a regular static state feedback (3) such that L f+gff ae (14) Let ! 2 . Then for (1,3) we have ! <ref> [1] </ref> = L f+gff ! + i=1 when we interpret as a subspace of span K fdxg. <p> This is a quasi-static feedback since v 1 = u 1 ; v 2 = u 1 u 2 + x 3 ( _u 1 + u 1 ) + x 2 This feedback renders invariant, since we have <ref> [1] </ref> = span K v f _v 1 dx 3 + v 1 d ((v 2 x 3 ( _v 1 + v 1 ) x 2 )=v 1 ) + d (x 3 v 1 + x 2 )g ae V The following theorem gives a necessary condition for controlled <p> Then there exists a function v 2 (u) such that (@v=@u) is square and invertible, where v = (v T 1 v T have that <ref> [1] </ref> ae + V (34) Moreover, since (@v=@u) is invertible, there exists a (x; v) such that u = (x; v). Hence defines a quasi-static state feedback and thus can be rendered invariant via quasi-static state feedback. <p> By the Implicit Function Theorem, for every point of this open and dense subset there exists a neighborhood of this point and a function such that u = (x; v; _v; ; v (k fl ) ). By applying this feedback, one has <ref> [1] </ref> ae + span K fdv (k) j k 0g Remark 3.13 The above theorem only gives sufficient conditions for the controlled invariance of a subspace ae X . In Theorem 3.7 it was shown that (i) is also a necessary condition. But the condition (ii) is not. <p> Clearly fl is controlled invariant (see Theorem 3.18). Hence there exists a quasi-static feedback (8) such that fl ae fl + V Now (53) implies that <ref> [1] </ref> ae + V and hence is controlled invariant. The following proposition gives conditions for the existence of a subspace ae X such that (52) holds. Proposition 3.20 Let ae X be a subspace such that (53) holds. <p> Thus, to prove Theorem 3.21, it suffices to show that the disturbance decoupling problem is solvable by quasi-static state feedback. Sufficiency. Controlled invariance of implies that there exists a quasi-static state feedback u = OE (x; v; ; v (r) ) such that <ref> [1] </ref> ae + V (58) dy [k] ae + V ; 8k 0 (59) Thus in the closed loop system the output y is decoupled from the disturbance. Necessity. Suppose that the quasi-static state feedback u = OE (x; v; ; v (r) ) solves the disturbance decoupling problem. <p> Therefore, for the system q fed back with u = OE (x; v; ; v (r) ), one has dy [k] ae span K v fdx; dv; ; dv (r+k1) g; 8k (60) Define the sequence as 0 = P ? (61) = lim : Obviously <ref> [1] </ref> ae + V. Thus, is a controlled invariant subspace. Since span K fdyg ae and ae P ? , (57) also holds. Condition in Theorem 3.21 is not constructive. <p> the ring A by taking ~ i = ( k=1 Definition 4.1 A subspace CaeX is said to be a controllability cospace for (1) if there exist a quasi-static state feedback (8) and a set of integers J ae f1; ; mg such that for (1, 8) one has C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C + V (63) C = maxffi ae X j span K f ~ [1] where ~ i is defined as above. This means that C is the largest autonomous subspace in X of the closed loop system. <p> said to be a controllability cospace for (1) if there exist a quasi-static state feedback (8) and a set of integers J ae f1; ; mg such that for (1, 8) one has C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C + V (63) C = maxffi ae X j span K f ~ [1] where ~ i is defined as above. This means that C is the largest autonomous subspace in X of the closed loop system. Moreover, by this definition, it is clear that a controllability cospace is controlled invariant. The following example illustrates the above definition. <p> This feedback is quasi-static since v 1 = u 1 c and v 2 = u 2 and v 3 = u 3 _u 1 x 3 u 2 From this, it is easy to show that C <ref> [1] </ref> = span K fdv 1 ; dx 4 u 1 dx 3 ; dv 3 + (x 3 (v 1 + c) + v 2 )dv 1 + x 3 d _v 1 g ae C + V 16 and C [1] j v 1 =0;v 3 =0 = span <p> this, it is easy to show that C <ref> [1] </ref> = span K fdv 1 ; dx 4 u 1 dx 3 ; dv 3 + (x 3 (v 1 + c) + v 2 )dv 1 + x 3 d _v 1 g ae C + V 16 and C [1] j v 1 =0;v 3 =0 = span K fdx 4 u 1 dx 3 g ae C Furthermore C = maxffi ae X j fi [1] j v 1 =0;v 3 =0 ae fig Hence C is a controllability cospace in the sense of Definition 4.1. 4.2 Controllability cospace <p> (v 1 + c) + v 2 )dv 1 + x 3 d _v 1 g ae C + V 16 and C <ref> [1] </ref> j v 1 =0;v 3 =0 = span K fdx 4 u 1 dx 3 g ae C Furthermore C = maxffi ae X j fi [1] j v 1 =0;v 3 =0 ae fig Hence C is a controllability cospace in the sense of Definition 4.1. 4.2 Controllability cospace algorithm First of all, we give an algorithm characterizing controllability cospaces, called the controllability cospace algorithm. Some properties of a general controllability cospace are then derived. <p> Let f~! i g be a basis for C in the module span A fdxg over the ring A. Then by definition there exists a quasi-static state feedback (8) and a set of integers J ae f1; ; mg such that C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C + V and C [1] = span K f~! [1] i j v j =0;j2J g ae C. From (65), it follows that S fl satisfies S fl = span K f! 2 X j _! 2 S fl + _ Cg (66) Let ! 2 C. <p> Let f~! i g be a basis for C in the module span A fdxg over the ring A. Then by definition there exists a quasi-static state feedback (8) and a set of integers J ae f1; ; mg such that C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C + V and C [1] = span K f~! [1] i j v j =0;j2J g ae C. From (65), it follows that S fl satisfies S fl = span K f! 2 X j _! 2 S fl + _ Cg (66) Let ! 2 C. <p> Then by definition there exists a quasi-static state feedback (8) and a set of integers J ae f1; ; mg such that C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C + V and C [1] = span K f~! [1] i j v j =0;j2J g ae C. From (65), it follows that S fl satisfies S fl = span K f! 2 X j _! 2 S fl + _ Cg (66) Let ! 2 C. <p> We have _! 2 _ C and hence ! 2 S fl . This implies that C ae S fl . Now, _ S fl ae S fl + _ C. By the feedback which yields C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C, one has S fl [1] ae S fl . Since C is the largest subspace in X such that C [1] ae C, one has S fl ae C. <p> We have _! 2 _ C and hence ! 2 S fl . This implies that C ae S fl . Now, _ S fl ae S fl + _ C. By the feedback which yields C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C, one has S fl [1] ae S fl . Since C is the largest subspace in X such that C [1] ae C, one has S fl ae C. <p> This implies that C ae S fl . Now, _ S fl ae S fl + _ C. By the feedback which yields C <ref> [1] </ref> ae C, one has S fl [1] ae S fl . Since C is the largest subspace in X such that C [1] ae C, one has S fl ae C. <p> This feedback always renders fl invariant. Thus, D fl is rendered invariant too, i.e., D <ref> [1] </ref> Let now f~! i g be a basis for D fl in the module span A fdxg over the ring A. <p> The goal is to show that the controllability cospaces introduced before are able to describe intrinsic geometric conditions with respect to quasi-static feedbacks, analogous to the above ones. Preliminary results may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Such solutions will contribute to the completion of the extension to nonlinear systems of the linear geometric theory ([48],[4]). DDDP, considered in Question 1, is a special control problem involving dynamic feedback and was first stated and studied in [26], [25], <ref> [44] </ref> where an (algebraic) solution was provided based on the inversion algorithm. Also a geometric interpretation is given by using (nonintrinsic) standard controlled invariant (co-)distributions on an extended state space, and then projecting these (co )distributions on the original state space to obtain intrinsic objects. <p> Of course, it goes without saying that the objects defined in this paper and the geometric objects defined in [26], [25], <ref> [44] </ref> carry the same information concerning the solvability of the DDDP. Recall that in the special case of linear systems, DDDP is equivalent to DDP (static feedback disturbance decoupling problem). The state of the art can be summarized in the following table, where notations are borrowed from [48],[29],[38]. <p> It may be checked that condition (62) is equivalent to the geometric conditions (44) in [26] and (4.5) in <ref> [44] </ref>. Further, (62) is exactly the same as the condition for solvability of the DDDP derived in [41]. However, in [41] the concept of controlled invariance was missing.

Reference-contexts: Question 2 originated in [30]. Standard controlled invariant distributions cannot be used to characterize the rank of a system in a straightforward manner.

Contributions which parallel the geometric and algebraic approaches can be found in [49]. Generalized controlled invariance introduced in this paper is shown to give a natural and intrinsic geometric characterization of the rank. <p> These controllability cospaces form a special class of the controlled invariant subspaces defined previously. They parallel the dynamic controllability distributions <ref> [45] </ref>.

The property was also derived by Respondek in <ref> [45] </ref> using dynamic controllability distributions.
