Abstract: We summarize the experimental signatures and searches for exotic mesons, based on theoretical prejudices of the flux tube model. Specific examples are given for the f 1 (1285) and b 1 (1235) systems.

Reference-contexts: One would also hope that such extensions would suggest fruitful new avenues to explore, in our quest for so-called "exotic" hadrons. The flux tube model <ref> [1] </ref> incorporates gluonic degrees of freedom into the quark model, by seizing on the idea that the vacuum expels glue similar to the way a superconductor expels magnetic flux. The force between two quarks, therefore, appears as a "flux tube" of glue which connects them.

Reference-contexts: This flux tube can also be excited, providing a new degree of freedom in the meson excitation spectrum. Furthermore, this model helps explain why gluonic excitations of mesons have not been observed, and where they might be found <ref> [2] </ref>. First, it naturally shows that the energy needed to excite the flux tube itself is quite large, ~ 1 GeV/c 2 or more, so these mesons would begin to appear near 2 GeV/c 2 . <p> Consequently, one is tempted to look at the reactions flp ! b 0 1 0 p, flp ! b Of course, given the availability and higher cross sections afforded by pion beams, it is worthwhile to search in the analogous reactions as well. 2 Searches Soon after the original suggestion <ref> [2] </ref> that photoproduction of S + P ststems might be a good place to look for gluonic mesons, the CERN -photon collaboration [3] reanalyzed some of their earlier data.

Indeed, the published result <ref> [4] </ref> shows that besides the dominant J P C = 1 ++ f 1 (1285) partial wave, there was also a significant exotic J P C = 1 + f 1 (1285) wave at nearly the same level.

An analysis <ref> [5] </ref> of f 1 (1285) final states does indeed suggest a peak in the mass spectrum near 1.8 GeV/c 2 .
