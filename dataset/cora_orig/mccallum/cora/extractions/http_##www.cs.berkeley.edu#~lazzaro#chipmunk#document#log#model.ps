Reference-contexts: There has been a substantial amount of modeling work which has addressed behavior in subthreshold (cf. [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9]). This work provides a wealth of background and useful analysis. The work reported by C.C. Enz, in his Ph.D. thesis <ref> [1] </ref>, has the additional feature that it seems to provide an efficient computational form that covers subthreshold, inversion, and the transition between regimes. It does not provide a model of operation in the linear regime. <p> Thus, gate voltages are intended to be well below threshold voltage and typical I ds values are around or below 10 9 A. 4.1 Weak Inversion The equation for drain current in weak inversion used by Enz in <ref> [1] </ref> takes the form: I d = K W SfiU 2 T e U T e U T (1) where: variable definition demensions S = channel width/length ratio (W/L) dimensionless U T = kT q = V k = 0:025v at room temperature V I d drain current A fi = <p> Therefore, ln (1 + *) * and, F (x) = e x : Now, if the strong inversion equation (3) is rewritten as I d = 2nSfiU 2 T 2U T 2U T * The references for the original suggestion of this approximation given in the thesis are: <ref> [1] </ref> H.J.

Sensitivity of I ds to V th It is often stated (for example in <ref> [2] </ref>) that the source of variation in I ds is lack of process control over V th . As has been shown above, part of the problem stems from inconsistent definitions of V th .

The device and process parameters for the measured devices are given in the text. The following figures show the same plots (of I d vs. V ds and I sat vs. V gs ) as in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 in [3].

In Figure 3 we adjusted the process parameters and an additional scale parameter to produce a close approximation to the Figures in [3]. In order to get an approximate fit it was necessary to use a scaling factor (I f ) of 80. and setting the scaling factor to 1.0. Comparing Figure 4 with either Figure 3 or the Figures from [3] shows a difference in current values of a factor of about <p> scale parameter to produce a close approximation to the Figures in <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to get an approximate fit it was necessary to use a scaling factor (I f ) of 80. and setting the scaling factor to 1.0. Comparing Figure 4 with either Figure 3 or the Figures from [3] shows a difference in current values of a factor of about 80. Discrepancies of this magnitude can have harmful effects on analog designs. DRAFT: 1.0 Printed: 7 December 1991. 17:23.

Discrepancies of this magnitude can have harmful effects on analog designs. DRAFT: 1.0 Printed: 7 December 1991. 17:23. CMOS Device Modeling for Subthreshold Circuits 9 5.2.2 Magnitude of the Early Effect It appears from data published in [3] (Figure B.3, pg. 325) that the Early Effect may be approximated as a linear function of channel length. <p> If a linear equation is roughly fitted using the data from Figure 3 one gets: V 0 = 6:9 + 17:3L: (9) However, use of this equation in the EVO model produces I d curves whose slope is about 3 times those shown in Figure 3.7 in <ref> [3] </ref>. This discrepancy is shown in Figure 5. DRAFT: 1.0 Printed: 7 December 1991. 17:23. 10 CMOS Device Modeling for Subthreshold Circuits 6. <p> Conversations with and new data from Andreas Andreou at Johns Hopkins helped to focus my attention on actual sources of variation. My general interest in exploring the effectiveness of subthreshold analog computation is inspired by Carver Mead, as expressed in <ref> [3] </ref> and elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, the results should be accurate for the circuit variables which significantly affect the behavior of typical constructions. For example, it should be possible to accurately compute gain and conductance. Tsividis <ref> [6] </ref> has pointed out that obtaining such accuracy is not as straightforward as might be thought, even when IV curves appear to be highly accurate. <p> There has been a substantial amount of modeling work which has addressed behavior in subthreshold (cf. <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9] </ref>).

V t is famous for its many conflicting definitions <ref> [6] </ref>. I 0 is well-known as the place where all the "left-overs" are dumped. In order to expect reasonable predictive power, both of these parameters need precise, measurement-based, definitions. 2. <p> The usual definition is that V t is the gate voltage such that the current due to drift is equal to the current due to diffusion. However, this is not a state that is directly measurable and therefore various indirect methods are used for measurement. Tsividis <ref> [6] </ref> makes this problem abundantly clear and shows specific examples of the resulting errors. The consequences of this problem for the Enz-Vittoz-Oguey model are discussed below. 3.

Reference-contexts: It is unrealistic to expect control of V th below about a percent, but this it what would be required if values of I ds with accuracy better than 20% were to be obtained. Pavasovic, Andreou and Westgate <ref> [7] </ref> and Pavasovic [8] have investigated variation in drain current in subthreshold within individual die. The results that they report are from modern standard fabrication processes, such as those provided through MOSIS.
