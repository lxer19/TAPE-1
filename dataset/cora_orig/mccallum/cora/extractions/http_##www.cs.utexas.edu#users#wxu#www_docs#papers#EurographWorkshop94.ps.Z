Abstract: In this paper, we take a new look at solvers for radiosity systems. We provide a systematic framework for the derivation of linear iterative solution methods and show how to use it to construct existing solvers such as progressive radiosity (PR) and the related techiques proposed by Gortler, Feda, Shao et al. Our framework provides us with a guide for finding fast algorithms; we have used it to devise a new algorithm which converges faster than existing methods. Some concepts are discussed and Feda's method is proved to be a PR method applied on a transformed system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In computer graphics, the radiosity problem is to determine the the equilibrium energy balance in an environment of light emitters and diffusely reflecting surfaces.

Because of limited space, we only discuss linear time solvers. For the comparison of PR and Gortler's methods vs Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods, please refer [Go93]. The progressive radiosity (PR) algorithm, presented by Cohen et al. in 1988 <ref> [Co88] </ref>, is the first O (n) method specifically designed to solve radiosity systems, although it was later shown to be equivalent to Southwell's relaxation method [Go93], which was developed in the 1940's and is considered the first modern iterative technique for solving systems of equations. <p> When we get an approximate solution x, it means that x is an intermediate stage in the process of reaching equilibrium.

To solve the convergence problem, Shao et al. [Sh93] and Gortler et al. <ref> [Go93] </ref> developed their own new overshooting algorithms independently. Their methods are similar in that both of them are based on a combination of radiance gathering and shooting among parts of the environment at each iteration. <p> Moreover, they are both positive overshooting methods, which means no negative energy interchanges are needed. 2 Xu, Fussell Although the positive overshooting methods have been proven to be convergent, they are not as fast as Feda's in some cases <ref> [Go93] </ref>. Recently, the authors gave a new overshooting algorithm (called Xu's method in this paper), which is based on a general mathematical analysis of radiosity equation systems [Xu94].

To understand negative energy shooting, we first must first distinguish between incorrect shooting and negative shooting. Energy shot from a patch, say the i th patch, at iteration p, is said to be incorrect if it makes jx (p) i j &gt; jx i x fl i j. <p> Notice that ~ F is a reasonable approximation of F based on the knowledge of form-factors; how good an approximation depends, of course, on the configuration of the environment.

In [Xu94], we also gave a modified version of Feda's method which outperforms Feda's original method experimentally, and we have shown that both Xu's method and the modification of Feda's method are convergent under certain conditions. <p> We then show that many of these systems are related to each other in that they are essentially the same techniques applied to different transformed systems of equations using various preconditioners. We then describe experimental results on a benchmark scene which confirm the results in <ref> [Xu94] </ref> indicating that our method converges faster than previous methods on a variety of scenes. <p> When we get an approximate solution x, it means that x is an intermediate stage in the process of reaching equilibrium. In previous methods <ref> [Co88, Fe92, Go93, Sh93, Xu94] </ref>, r i is called the unshot radiosity of the i th patch after radiosity x i has been shot from the patch. In overshooting methods, r i could be negative. <p> Since r = (I F)(x fl x), we see that the relationship between signs of elements in r and signs of elements in x fl x is quite complicated <ref> [Xu94] </ref>. For these reasons, in this paper, we call r the residual and x fl i x i the unshot energy. 3 General Linear Solvers Notice that the coefficient matrix in Eq (1) is row diagonally dominant while the coefficient matrix in Eq (2) is column diagonally dominant. <p> All five previous methods can be regarded as the general solver applied to Eq (1), with different choices of G to approach A 1 and methods for selecting i as described in the following table <ref> [Xu94] </ref>. 1 method How to choose i G PR: r i = jjDr (p) jj 1 I Shao: r (p) i = jjDr (p) jj 1 I + F Gortler: r (p) i = jjDr (p) jj 1 M 1 i (depending on index i) Feda: r (p) Xu: r i <p> However, our modification of Feda's method is the PR method (positive increments, no overshooting) with respect to the system of Eq (17). Thus, its residuals with respect to Eq (17) are all positive. We can therefore show that it converges under reasonable conditions <ref> [Xu94] </ref>, just as we can for Xu's method. This demonstrates that under proper conditions, negative increments are not necessarily incorrect, as we have discussed above. <p> Figures 5-7 show the results after 300 iterations, and criteria for choosing shooting patches. 4.1 Computational Requirements For each iteration, the amount of work done by PR, Shao's, Gortler's, Feda's and Xu's methods are proportional to 2n, 3n (average), 4n (average), 5n and 7n respectively <ref> [Xu94] </ref>. Since calculating form-factors is the greatest expense in each iteration for these methods if they are recalculated on the fly, the time required 10 Xu, Fussell to obtain the solution strongly depends on the number of iterations needed. <p> In this case, Xu's method is expected to be the fastest one in the cases we have tested <ref> [Xu94] </ref>.
