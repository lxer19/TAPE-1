Abstract: Modern enterprises increasingly use the workflow paradigm to prescribe how business processes should be performed. Processes are typically modeled as annotated activity graphs. We present an approach for a system that constructs process models from logs of past, unstructured executions of the given process. The graph so produced conforms to the dependencies and past executions present in the log. By providing models that capture the previous executions of the process, this technique allows easier introduction of a workflow system and evaluation and evolution of existing process models. We also present results from applying the algorithm to synthetic data sets as well as process logs obtained from an IBM Flowmark installation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will only consider Problem 1. Problem 2 is the subject of ongoing research; some preliminary ideas can be found in <ref> [AGL97] </ref>. Assume throughout that the process graph has jV j = n vertices, and the log contains m separate executions of the process. Generally, m n. In Sections 3 and 4, we will assume that the process graph is acyclic. <p> The final step is to merge the vertices of each equivalent set into one vertex. In doing so, we put an edge in the new graph if there exists an edge between two vertices of different equivalent sets of the original graph. The algorithm is given in detail in <ref> [AGL97] </ref>. 6 Noise A problem we have to consider is noise in the log. This problem can arise because erroneous activities were inserted in the log, or some activities that were executed were not logged, or some activities were reported in out of order time sequence. <p> The control conditions can be arbitrary Boolean functions of some global process state. To obtain useful information about these functions, additional information about the changes in the global state of the process must be present in the log. One possible approach, discussed in <ref> [AGL97] </ref>, is to make the simplifying assumption that the control conditions are simple Boolean functions of the output of the activity. We can now use a classifier [WK91] to learn the Boolean fuctions.

Reference-contexts: Since m n, the second step clearly dominates the running time. The running time of step 4 is O (jV jjEj) = O (n 3 ) <ref> [AGU72] </ref>. 2 5 The transitive reduction of a directed graph G is the smallest subgraph of G that has the same closure as G [AGU72]. A DAG has a unique transitive reduction. Example 6.

Reference-contexts: An activity appears only once in a process graph as a vertex label, whereas the same token (activity) may appear multiple times in an automaton. The problem considered in this paper generalizes the problem of mining sequential patterns <ref> [AS95] </ref> [MTV95], but it is applicable in a more restricted setting. Sequential patterns allow only a total ordering of fully parallel subsets, whereas process graphs are richer structures: they can be used to model any partial ordering of the activities and admit cycles in the general setting. <p> Since this modeling technique is compatible with workflow systems, the algorithm's use can facilitate the introduction of such systems. In modeling the process as a graph, we generalize the problem of mining sequential patterns <ref> [AS95] </ref> [MTV95]. The algorithm is still practical, however, because it computes a single graph that conforms with all process executions. The algorithm has been implemented and tested with both real and synthetic data. The implementation uses Flowmark's model and log conventions [LA92].

Reference-contexts: We assume that * &lt; 1=2. Then, given m executions, the expected number of out of order sequences for a given pair of activities is *m. Clearly T must be larger than *m. The probability that there are at least T errors, assuming they happen at random, is <ref> [CLR90] </ref>: P [ more than T errors in m executions] = T X i * i (1 *) ni m The use of T implies that if two independent activities have been executed in a given order at least mT times, a dependency between them will be added.

The work we present has been done in the context of the IBM workflow product, Flowmark <ref> [LA92] </ref>. However, the process model we consider is quite general and the algorithms we propose are applicable to other workflow systems. The new capability we are proposing can be applied in several ways. <p> These are the process' activating and terminating activities.

In Sections 3 and 4, we will assume that the process graph is acyclic. This assumption is reasonable in many cases and, in fact, it is also frequently the case in practice <ref> [LA92] </ref>. We will relax this assumption in Section 5 and allow for cycles in the process graph. 3 Finding directed acyclic graphs We first consider the special case of finding model graphs for acyclic processes whose executions contain exactly one instance of every activity. <p> The algorithm is still practical, however, because it computes a single graph that conforms with all process executions. The algorithm has been implemented and tested with both real and synthetic data. The implementation uses Flowmark's model and log conventions <ref> [LA92] </ref>. The results obtained from these experiments validated the scalability and usability of the proposed algorithm. An important and interesting problem for future work is learning the control conditions. The control conditions can be arbitrary Boolean functions of some global process state.
