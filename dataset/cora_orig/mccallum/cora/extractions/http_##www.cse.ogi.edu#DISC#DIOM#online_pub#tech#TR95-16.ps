Abstract: A large-scale interoperable database system operating in a dynamic environment should provide a uniform access user interface to its components, scalability to larger networks, evolution of database schema and applications, composability of client and server components, and preserve component autonomy. To address the research issues presented by such systems, we introduce the Distributed Interoperable Object Model (DIOM). DIOM promotes an adaptive approach to interoperation and mediation [34, 35], aimed at improving the robustness and scalability of the interoperation services used for integrating and accessing heterogeneous information resources. DIOM's main features include the explicit representation of semantics in data sources through the DIOM base interfaces, the use of interface composition mechanisms to support the incremental design and construction of compound interoperation interfaces, the decoupling of semantic heterogeneity from the representational mismatch, the deferment of semantic conflict resolution to the query submission time instead of at the time of information gathering and integration, and a clean interface between distributed interoperable component objects that supports the independent evolution and management of such objects. To make DIOM concrete, we outline the Diorama architecture, which includes important auxiliary services such as domain-specific library functions, object linking databases, and query decomposition and packaging strategies. Several practical examples and application scenarios illustrate the usefulness of DIOM.

Reference-contexts: Distributed interoperable objects are objects that support a level of interoperability beyond the traditional object computing boundaries imposed by programming languages, data models, process address space, and network interface <ref> [1] </ref>. The abstractions of distributed interoperable objects are captured in the Distributed Interoperable Object Model (DIOM), described in Section 3. Diorama is an interoperable software architecture based on DIOM to support USECA properties.

Reference-contexts: Examples of data sources include data repositories managed by relational database systems, object-oriented database systems, file systems, document managers, image 5 managers, video servers, and information resources gathered by other mediators (e.g., TSIMMIS [11]) or information brokers (e.g., Harvest <ref> [2] </ref>). Above each repository or mediator is an information resource wrapper. The main task of a resource wrapper is to control and facilitate the external access to the data source, based on the export schema provided by the data source manager at its integration into the interoperable system. <p> Diorama approach allows new sources to become useful to the DIOM users as soon as a wrapper is supplied. This approach allows a flexible integration of information resources gathered by other mediators or resource discovery systems <ref> [2, 11, 33] </ref>. For a further discussion, refer to Section 5. In the middle right of Figure 1, the DIOM meta object library consists of DIOM interface repository and DIOM implementation repository. <p> DIOM approach to interoperation allows flexible integration and and access of heterogeneous information gathered by other mediators or information brokers, such as the TSIMMIS system [11] and the HARVEST resource discovery toolkit <ref> [2] </ref>, as soon as a wrapper/adaptor is provided, for example between Diorama and TSIMMIS or between Diorama and HARVEST (see Figure 14). In addition, a number of proposals have competed as the basic enabling technologies for implementing interoperable objects in distributed and dynamic object computing environments.

Each application may set up its own interoperable interface schema using DIOM/IDL.

Reference-contexts: Due to the space limitation, we omit the discussion on the DIOM built-in type hierarchy and the BNF syntax of the IDL in this paper. Readers who are interested in this part may refer to our technical report <ref> [20] </ref>. 3.3 Advanced Concepts for Interface Definitions 3.3.1 Base Interface and Compound Interfaces As mentioned earlier, a type of distributed interoperable objects is defined by specifying its interface in the DIOM Interface Definition Language (DIOM-IDL). The DIOM interfaces are classified into two categories: base interfaces and compound interfaces. <p> In the first phase of DIOM implementation, the specialization abstraction is only supported for construction of a new interface based on one or more base interfaces whose scope is the same data repository (see <ref> [20] </ref> for more detail). 18 3.3.5 Interface Composition Mechanism: Import The import mechanism is designed for importing selected portions of the data from a given export schema, instead of importing everything that is available. <p> We may specify the University interface by using the DIOM import facility as shown in Figure 10 (a). Three types are explicitly imported from UnivDB1. They are Person, TA, and Professor. For the BNF syntax of the IDL import specification, readers may refer to our technical report <ref> [20] </ref>. According to the referential integrity and type closure property, the type Course needs to be imported as well, because the Course objects are referenced by the imported types such as Professor and TA (see Figure 10 (b)).

For example, the idea of using a repository/resource wrapper to bridge between the interoperable database system and the individual component repositories is to some extent encouraged by the mediator approach. The intelligent integration of information through query compilation is also supported in the DIOM framework.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in database interoperability has started to pay more attention to interoperation architectures that may support both tight-coupling and loose-coupling (cf. <ref> [11, 9, 24, 27, 34] </ref>). A few prototype systems are under development. <p> The DIOM development is motivated mainly by the mediator architecture <ref> [33, 34, 35] </ref>. For example, the idea of using a repository/resource wrapper to bridge between the interoperable database system and the individual component repositories is to some extent encouraged by the mediator approach. The intelligent integration of information through query compilation is also supported in the DIOM framework.

Reference-contexts: A discussion of other interesting issues on interoperation and mediation may refer to a recent paper by Gio Wiederhold <ref> [35] </ref>. <p> The DIOM development is motivated mainly by the mediator architecture <ref> [33, 34, 35] </ref>. For example, the idea of using a repository/resource wrapper to bridge between the interoperable database system and the individual component repositories is to some extent encouraged by the mediator approach. The intelligent integration of information through query compilation is also supported in the DIOM framework. <p> Comparing with the Context Interchange proposal, both DIOM approach and Context Interchange approach support explicit representation of semantics underlying disparate data sources and heterogeneous receivers. However, in contrast to the shared ontology model <ref> [35] </ref> used in the Context Interchange proposal, DIOM provides an interface definition language and a semantically rich and yet clean framework that allows independent evolution and management of distributed interoperable objects.

Reference-contexts: The IDL/IQL preprocessor itself consists of four basic modules as shown in Figure 11. They are syntax analyzer, optimization module, query dispatch module and query assembler module. 2 According to I3 glossary <ref> [36] </ref>, a mediator is a software component at middleware layer with services that facilitate integration and access of heterogeneous information.
