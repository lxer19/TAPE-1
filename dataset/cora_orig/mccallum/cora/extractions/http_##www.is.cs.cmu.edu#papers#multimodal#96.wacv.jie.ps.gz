Title: Abstract  
Abstract: We present a real-time face tracker in this paper. The system has achieved a rate of 30+ frames/second using an HP-9000 workstation with a framegrabber and a Canon VC-C1 camera. It can track a persons face while the person moves freely (e.g., walks, jumps, sits down and stands up) in a room. Three types of models have been employed in developing the system. First, we present a stochastic model to characterize skin-color distributions of human faces. The information provided by the model is sufficient for tracking a human face in various poses and views. This model is adaptable to different people and different lighting conditions in real-time. Second, a motion model is used to estimate image motion and to predict search window. Third, a camera model is used to predict and to compensate for camera motion. The system can be applied to tele-conferencing and many HCI applications including lip-reading and gaze tracking. The principle in developing this system can be extended to other tracking problems such as tracking the human hand.

Reference-contexts: Face perception is currently an active research area in the computer vision community. Much research has been directed towards feature recognition in human faces. Three basic techniques are commonly used for dealing with feature variations: correlation templates [1][2], deformable templates <ref> [3] </ref>, and spatial image invariants [4]. Several systems of locating human face have been reported. Eigenfaces, obtained by performing a principal component analysis on a set of faces, are commonly used to identify faces [5].

In this paper, we discuss the problem of tracking a human face in real-time. <p> Much research has been directed to understanding and making use of color information. Color has been long used for object recognition [15][16][17] and recently has been successfully applied to road tracking [18] and face tracking <ref> [8] </ref>. In the next section, we develop a stochastic model of skin-color in the chromatic color space for tracking a human face. The model has only a few parameters and is easily adaptable to different people and different lighting conditions.
