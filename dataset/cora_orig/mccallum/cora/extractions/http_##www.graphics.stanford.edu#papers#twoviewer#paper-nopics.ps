Abstract: We present the two-user Responsive Workbench: a projection-based virtual reality system that allows two people to simultaneously view individual stereoscopic image pairs from their own viewpoints. The system tracks the head positions of both users and computes four images one for each eye of each person. To display the four images as two stereo pairs, we must ensure each image is correctly presented to the appropriate eye. We describe a hardware solution to this display problem as well as registration and calibration procedures. These procedures ensure that when two users point to the same location on a virtual object, their fingers will physically touch. Since the stereo pairs are independent, we have the option of displaying specialized views of the shared virtual environment to each user. We present several scenarios in which specialized views might be useful.

Reference-contexts: When someone refers to an object by pointing to it, the object becomes the focus of the group. It is because of these visual cues that people often find it easier to communicate and collaborate when they are face-to-face than across a voice-only medium like a telephone <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, face-to-face collaboration requires that participants can see some representation of one another and is best achieved when they share a single, visually consistent environment In projection-based virtual reality systems, users can see each other and therefore communicate face-to-face.

Reference-contexts: Direct verbal communication is the most common type of interaction amongst a group of people. In a face-to-face situation, facial expressions and hand gestures provide important backchan-nels which create a sense of awareness and involvement within the group <ref> [2] </ref>. Other visual cues such as lip motions make it easier to understand what a speaker is saying. When a group performs a task in a shared physical space, gestures are often used to refer to objects.

Reference-contexts: However, all tracking devices suffer distortions, and those present in magnetic systems like the Polhemus Fas-trak can be quite large [10]. We have developed a look-up table approach for correcting these distortions, which is similar to methods developed by Bryson <ref> [3] </ref>, Ghazisaedy et al. [6], and Livingston [9]. We begin by measuring points on a grid in physical space using a Polhemus 6DOF stylus. For each of these points, we save the corresponding location reported in tracker space.

Reference-contexts: A natural question is whether virtual environments can similarly provide a shared space in which collaborative interactions occur as easily and smoothly as they would in the real world. Projection-based virtual reality systems such as the CAVE <ref> [4] </ref> and the Responsive Workbench [8] [7] are close analogues to white-boards. In such systems, stereoscopic images are projected onto a large screen allowing groups of people to simultaneously view a virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: Giving users the ability to view the same virtual environment while standing near one another allows them to communicate about the environment by voice and gesture. We are just beginning to explore the types of software tools and interfaces that might further assist such collaborative interaction. Cutler et al. <ref> [5] </ref> have shown that two-handed interaction tools can be useful in the Responsive Workbench environment. In a two user system, there are three or four hands possibly acting in a coordinated fashion. We are investigating how to extend their methods for this situation.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding points define a change-of-basis matrix between the two coordinate frames. This method works well when there are no distortions in the tracker measurements.

In figure 6, we describe a scenario in which a teacher uses private notes while giving an Anatomy Lesson to a student. Tang <ref> [11] </ref> describes meetings in which participants take notes or sketch ideas on a private notepad which they later make public and present to the rest of the group. Such private information spaces could be useful for developing one's own ideas in a group setting.
