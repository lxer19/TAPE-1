Title: Diversity Combining for Fading Channels  
Author: Michael Goodwin 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: Digital Communications Project Department of Electrical Engineering University of California at  
Abstract: The intent of this project is to investigate applications of diversity to Rayleigh fading channels. Namely, diversity communication effectively reduces the bit error rate provided that the diversity branches are combined according to certain optimality criteria. Various methods of attaining diversity are discussed, and several diversity combining techniques are examined. These analyses focus on quantifying the performance of diversity combiners with respect to signal-to-noise ratio and probability of symbol error. Such analyses rely heavily on assumptions about the Rayleigh channel; they also depend on the underlying modulation and coding schemes. These factors are considered.

Reference-contexts: The combiners that do exceed the threshold perform reliably at that outage rate. Yet another measure of diversity gain is the ratio of the SNR at a given probability to the SNR at the same probability for a single channel <ref> [1] </ref>. An exact quantization requires 19 explicit knowledge of the probability densities of the combiner SNRs. Further treatment of this approach is beyond the scope of this investigation; it suffices to note that this indicator of diversity gain reflects the expected relative performance of the various combiners.

Reference-contexts: A general result of interest is that this adaptive array combining with one infinitely strong interferer results in the same performance as maximal ratio combining without the interferer and with one less diversity branch <ref> [4, 21] </ref>. Thus, in the presence of a strong interferer, adaptive array combining with an additional antenna will always perform more favorably than maximal ratio combining.

Reference-contexts: It is accordingly assumed that noiseless estimates of the channel phase can be attained; thus, the signals r n can be cophased so that their addition does not result in destructive interference in y. Slow fading ensures that the channel remains constant for a duration of many symbol intervals <ref> [5] </ref>. Nonselective fading implies that the received signal is not severely dispersed in time; in the digital domain, nonselective fading corresponds to the case of no intersymbol interference (ISI). <p> IV The Gaussian receiver noise on separate diversity branches is independent and identically distributed with zero-mean and variance 2 . Mathematically, E [z i (t)z j (t)] = 2 ffi ij . The analyses are first carried out in terms of the SNR statistics as in <ref> [5, 9] </ref>; this is justifiable since the SNR is an adequate predictive measure of digital system performance. After examinations of the three diversity combiners, the combiner performances are compared according to various measures. <p> Since the SNR of a reception 1 Selection combining is thus closely related to scanning, switching, or feedback diversity <ref> [5, 9, 12] </ref> in which the combiner selects a diversity branch and then stays with that branch until its SNR drops below a specified threshold. At the point, a branch with SNR above the threshold is selected. <p> This improvement is clearly marginal for large N . It is noted here that selection combining does not take into account assumptions II and III; it is therefore expected that other combining strategies will outperform selection <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> The distribution function is thus given by: F N (fl R ) = 1 e G n=1 fl R n1 For infinite N , the second term in the above difference is equal to one. The distribution function can therefore be rewritten as <ref> [5] </ref>: F N (fl)R) = n=N fl R n e G fl R N e G Since the output SNR is the sum of the branch SNRs, the expected value of the SNR of the combiner output is &lt; fl R &gt; = n=1 which increases linearly with N as opposed <p> Using computer simulations, however, it has been shown that the distribution lies between that of selection (fl S ) and that of optimal (fl R ) diversity. Generally the performance is less than one dB inferior to maximal ratio combining with respect to SNR <ref> [5, 9] </ref>. <p> The presence of unequal branch mean SNRs thus causes a reduction in the effective diversity order of a selection combiner. The case of correlated fading is dealt with extensively in the literature <ref> [5, 12, 18, 20] </ref>. A basic performance comparison follows from the consideration of Figure 4, which depicts integration regions over the joint distribution of the two reception envelopes ff 1 and ff 2 .

Reference-contexts: For instance, in contradiction to the explanation in Section 2.2, it can be shown that for M -ary orthogonal signaling in an energy-sharing environment, the M O selection criterion outperforms the M fl scheme with respect to probability of error <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.4 Cochannel Interference The problem of cochannel interference was described in Section 2.6; as the name implies, CCI results from extraneous channel users such as those present in a cellular mobile radio environment. In a diversity reception system with CCI, the maximal ratio combining technique is no longer optimal.

Reference-contexts: Thus, fading channel issues are of fundamental significance to radio communication. And, since fading channel degradations apply equivalently to analog and digital signals, the investigation of fading channels is irrevocably connected to recent proposals regarding digital cellular 1 mobile radio <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. In that scenario, multipath due to urban terrain and channel variations due to the motion of the receiver provide additional complexity to the communication problem [9]. <p> For this reason, the maximal ratio combiner is not optimal for the reception of a signal with ISI. Whereas maximal ratio combining does reduce ISI if the diversity order is high, better performance can be achieved by minimizing the mean-square symbol error (MMSE) as discussed by Clark in <ref> [7] </ref>. Minimizing the mean-square error (MSE) in turn minimizes an upper bound on the bit error rate, resulting in better expected system performance. The derivation of the MMSE combiner begins with a formulation of the discrete-time impulse response of the entire system. <p> If it is further assumed that there is no CCI, which simplifies the derivations in <ref> [7] </ref> without diminishing the relevance of the result, the mean-square symbol error can be expressed as MSE = E [j a 0 a 0 j 2 ] = E [j k6=0 where the symbol subscripts are time indices; the data symbols are hereafter assumed to adhere to the correlation E [a

Reference-contexts: In that scenario, multipath due to urban terrain and channel variations due to the motion of the receiver provide additional complexity to the communication problem <ref> [9] </ref>. The undesirable effects of fading channels can be alleviated somewhat through the use of diversity, wherein several independently fading communication paths are established from the transmitter to the receiver. Since the separate channels fade independently, it is not likely that all of the channels will simultaneously experience deep fades. <p> For large k, the models are equivalent. Such time-varying channels are dealt with extensively in the literature from both phenomenological and theoretical viewpoints <ref> [9, 17, 18] </ref>. A single component of the multipath impulse response can be modeled as a phasor with random magnitude and angle, both of which change with time. The composite impulse response for the multipath channel, then, is the superposition of many such time-varying phasors. <p> If the antennas are spaced sufficiently far apart, the communication channels from the transmitter to each antenna fade independently. Typically this sufficient spacing is on the order of several carrier wavelengths. Rigorous derivations of the sufficient spacing can be found in the literature <ref> [9, 18] </ref>. The opposite configuration is also an incarnation of space diversity: multiple transmitting antennas can broadcast to a single receiver. <p> IV The Gaussian receiver noise on separate diversity branches is independent and identically distributed with zero-mean and variance 2 .

After examinations of the three diversity combiners, the combiner performances are compared according to various measures. <p> Reiterating, p (ff) = E 0 ff 2 n where E 0 is the variance of a unit component of the complex Gaussian process that results in the Rayleigh density <ref> [9] </ref>. The random variable ff n defines an envelope for the transmitted signal s (t); assuming that s (t) is a stationary process, the value of ff n determines the strength of the received signal on the n-th diversity branch. <p> Since the SNR of a reception 1 Selection combining is thus closely related to scanning, switching, or feedback diversity <ref> [5, 9, 12] </ref> in which the combiner selects a diversity branch and then stays with that branch until its SNR drops below a specified threshold. At the point, a branch with SNR above the threshold is selected. <p> In fact, optimal diversity gives the best statistical reduction of fading of any known linear diversity combining technique for a slow nonselective fading channel <ref> [9] </ref>. The single difficulty in maximal ratio combining is the computation of the taps b n = ff n =. Since ff n is time-varying, an estimate of the channel must be attained in a period of time not longer than a few symbol intervals. <p> Using computer simulations, however, it has been shown that the distribution lies between that of selection (fl S ) and that of optimal (fl R ) diversity. Generally the performance is less than one dB inferior to maximal ratio combining with respect to SNR <ref> [5, 9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: That is also expected given the fact that a selection combiner discards relevant information unless all but one of the channels are deeply faded; it can therefore not be optimal. 2.3 Optimal Combining In maximal ratio or optimal combining, first proposed by Kahn in <ref> [10] </ref>, the b n are chosen so as to maximize the SNR of the combiner output; equivalently, this minimizes the probability of symbol error in a digital system.

Reference-contexts: This energy-sharing results in a fundamental tradeoff: increasing the number of branches reduces the probability of simultaneous deep fades, but also reduces the SNR on each branch. Therefore, in an energy-sharing diversity communication system, an optimal number of diversity branches exists <ref> [13, 18] </ref>. This is not the case for a space diversity reception system, wherein an increase in the number of diversity branches always improves the receiver performance. This will be further analyzed in Chapter 3. <p> The &lt; BER &gt; can be minimized by maximizing the denominator function g (N ) = n=1 1 + 2N n As Leung points out in reference <ref> [13] </ref>, after which most of this analysis is patterned, g (N ) = g (N 1) if G 0 = 2 (N 1)N as can be verified by examining these expressions: g (N ) = n=1 1 + n g (N 1) = n=1 1 + n It follows that a

This will be further analyzed in Chapter 3. <p> In fact, any performance statistic that depends on the density of the SNR at the combiner output can be expected to indicate this performance hierarchy; also, the relative values of such statistics tend to be nearly identical <ref> [18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Maximal ratio combining maximizes the SNR at the combiner output; optimal combining for a CCI channel should instead maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In the presence of CCI, the error probability is determined by the SINR. The maximization of SINR as formulated by Winters in <ref> [21] </ref> is treated summarily in the following discussion. A space diversity system can be viewed as a generalized beamforming array. <p> Such an estimate can be attained since slow fading was assumed. This combining technique outperforms maximal ratio combining in that its mean output SINR is greater, thus implying a higher diversity gain and a correspondingly lower error probability. More exacting results are given in <ref> [21] </ref> but the derivation of those results 30 is tedious and hinges on the establishment of unduly many intermediate variables and assumptions regarding interference conditions and signaling techniques. <p> A general result of interest is that this adaptive array combining with one infinitely strong interferer results in the same performance as maximal ratio combining without the interferer and with one less diversity branch <ref> [4, 21] </ref>. Thus, in the presence of a strong interferer, adaptive array combining with an additional antenna will always perform more favorably than maximal ratio combining. <p> If in a cellular mobile radio system acceptable performance results from the use of maximal ratio combining, changing the combining technique to this adaptive array method would allow the addition of one mobile receiver per channel per cell at the expense of one additional antenna at the base station <ref> [21] </ref>. 3.5 Intersymbol Interference For a Rayleigh fading channel with a large delay spread, a transmitted pulse is dispersed significantly in time as it passes through the channel; thus, if in a digital communication system a sequence of pulses corresponding to symbols is transmitted over such a channel, the receiver may
