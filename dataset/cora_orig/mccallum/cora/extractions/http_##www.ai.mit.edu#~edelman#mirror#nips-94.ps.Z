Abstract: The maximization of diversity of neuronal response properties has been recently suggested as an organizing principle for the formation of such prominent features of the functional architecture of the brain as the cortical columns and the associated patchy projection patterns (Malach, 1994). We report a computational study of two aspects of this hypothesis. First, we show that maximal diversity is attained when the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes is equal to one, as it has been found in many cortical areas and across species (Lund et al., 1993; Malach, 1994). Second, we show that maximization of diversity leads to better performance in two case studies: in systems of receptive fields implementing steerable/shiftable filters, and in matching spatially distributed signals, a problem that arises in visual tasks such as stereopsis, motion processing, and recognition.

Reference-contexts: In their early recordings, Hubel and Wiesel reported discrete shifts rather than a continuous change in orientation preference. In subsequent recordings they found that orientation shifts can vary more smoothly, and concluded that orientation preference varies continuously throughout V1 (Hubel and Wiesel, 1977). Cortical maps obtained by optical imaging <ref> (Grinvald et al., 1986) </ref> reveal that orientation columns are patchy rather then slab-like, i.e., domains corresponding to a single orientation appear as a mosaic of round patches, which tend to form pinwheel-like structures.

(LeVay, 1989) suggests that intrinsic patchy connections could arise during development in response to a rule of the kind "cells that fire together wire together".

Reference-contexts: We start with some background regarding the orientation columns in V1. 3.1 Background The orientation columns in V1 are perhaps the best-known example of functional architecture found in the cortex. On the basis of single unit recordings <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962) </ref> reported that cells encountered in penetrations perpendicular to the cortical surface have similar orientation selectivity. In tangential penetrations, orientation preference shifts as the electrode advances. In their early recordings, Hubel and Wiesel reported discrete shifts rather than a continuous change in orientation preference.

It is possible that these connections emerge from profuse non-patchy projections, by a selective activity-dependent elimination of synapses.

Reference-contexts: Insofar as this correlation between column or patch size and dendritic spread is a fundamental property that holds throughout various cortical areas and across species <ref> (Lund et al., 1993) </ref>, one is led to assume that it constitutes an important characteristic of the columnar architecture of the cortex. Determining its functional significance may, therefore, shed light on the principles that drive the evolution of the cortical architecture. <p> must minimize: E m = p=1 i=1 N X b i ip (10) 5 Summary Our results show that maximal diversity of neuronal response properties is attained when the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes is equal to 1, a value found in many cortical areas and across species <ref> (Lund et al., 1993) </ref>. It also appears that maximization of diversity leads to better performance in systems of receptive fields implementing steerable/shiftable filters, which may be necessary for generating the seemingly continuous range of orientation selectivity found in V1, and in matching spatially distributed signals.

Reference-contexts: The right panel in Figure 3 shows that as the basis RFs are made bigger, fewer of them are needed to achieve a given approximation error. 3.3 Steerability and biological considerations The anatomical finding that the columnar "borders" are freely crossed by dendritic and axonal arbors <ref> (Malach, 1992) </ref>, and the mathematical properties of shiftable/steerable filters outlined above suggest that the columnar architecture in V1 provides a basis for creating a continuum of RF properties, rather that being a form of organizing RFs in discrete bins. <p> On the one hand, the intrinsic patchy connections exhibit a certain degree of wiring precision. On the other hand, there is also a significant patch-interpatch mixing <ref> (Malach, 1992) </ref>, and a typical patch has a non-negligible diameter of 200 300 m. The number of axonal arborizations in a patch is of an order of magnitude of 10 4 , and about the same number of dendrites sample it.

Reference-contexts: Determining its functional significance may, therefore, shed light on the principles that drive the evolution of the cortical architecture. One such driving principle may be the maximization of diversity in the neuronal population in the cortex <ref> (Malach, 1994) </ref>. <p> Figure 1, right, shows that diversity is maximized when the size of the dendritic arbors matches that of the axonal patches, in accordance with the anatomical data. This result confirms the diversity maximization hypothesis stated in <ref> (Malach, 1994) </ref>. 3 Orientation tuning as a functional manifestation of neuronal sampling diversity In this section, we consider the smooth gradation of orientation tuning across the cortical surface in area V1 in mammals as a possible consequence of highly diverse sampling in the underlying neuronal population. <p> Thus, the maximization of diversity of neuronal response properties considered as a cortical organization principle <ref> (Malach, 1994) </ref> may have the double advantage of accounting for the formation of the cortical columns and the associated patchy projection patterns, and of explaining how systems of receptive fields can support functions such as the generation of precise response tuning from imprecise distributed inputs, and the matching of distributed signals,

Their results show that long-range connections, extending one mm or more, tend to link cells with like orientation preference.

Reference-contexts: As an example of the learning algorithm, one may chose radial basis function (RBF) approximation <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref>. This approach is particularly suitable for our purpose, because the basis functions in RBF approximation can be regarded as multidimensional Gaussian RFs.

Reference-contexts: Computationally, this may be possible if the input to neurons is a linear combination of outputs of several RFs, as in equation 3. Is this assumption warranted by other anatomical and physiological data regarding cortical interconnection patterns? Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling studies <ref> (Rockland and Lund, 1982) </ref> have shown that lateral connections of orientation columns extend to a range of 2 4 mm. In other studies that used 2DG autoradiography and retrograde labeling, connectivity patterns were superimposed on functional maps (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1989).
