Title: HBS Interface Specification  
Date: Revised: August 22, 1995  
Note: HBS Version 4.0.0 Last  
Abstract: Philip Johnson Carleton Moore Rosemary Andrada Collaborative Software Development Laboratory Department of Information and Computer Sciences University of Hawaii Honolulu, HI 96822 (808) 956-3489 ICS/CSDL Technical Report 94-14 Abstract This document specifies the interface protocol observed between the HBS server system and the ECS client system, together known as Egret. HBS is a multiuser, database server for (non-video) hypermedia applications. It manages storage, locking, retrieval, and inter-client communications. This document is intended to describe the interface between HBS and ECS in enough detail so that alternative database servers can be built to service requests from an ECS clients. It is also intended to serve as a source of reference material for maintainers of the HBS and ECS systems.

The course was very successful and well-received by participants, and at the end of the summer, two groups' implementations were combined to create the first CSDL-based HyperBase implementation.

Reference-contexts: The summer programming course participants divided into four groups, each developing in parallel their own revised version of the HyperBase. In addition to fixing bugs and incorporating enhancements, the groups rewrote individual class implementations to conform to recently published guidelines for C++ syntax and structure <ref> [3] </ref> and C++ class design [1, 2]. The course was very successful and well-received by participants, and at the end of the summer, two groups' implementations were combined to create the first CSDL-based HyperBase implementation.

Reference-contexts: In parallel with the HyperBase server, several client tools were developed, including a textual front-end implemented in Emacs called EHTS and a graphical browser. The Aalborg group published several documents about this work: comprehensive low-level design and implementation documentation for the Hyperbase <ref> [7] </ref>, two overviews of the architecture and initial experiences with Hyperbase [8, 4], and overviews focussing on the design of the EHTS client [5] and the event-based mechanism [6]. <p> Another example is the many-to-one" linking mechanism that survives in HBS from the original HyperBase but is not supported in ECS. Reference to the original HyperBase design document <ref> [7] </ref> may sometimes be needed to understand certain aspects of the current HBS implementation. 3 Basic Services HBS provides several essential services to ECS clients: file-based storage, socket and ID management, data storage and retrieval, concurrency control, event-based notification, Gagent awareness, and compound operations.
