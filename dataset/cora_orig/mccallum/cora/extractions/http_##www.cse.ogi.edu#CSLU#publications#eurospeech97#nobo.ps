Abstract: Temporal processing of the time trajectories in the logarithmic spectrum domain, performed in cepstral mean subtraction, in computation of dynamic features in speech, or in RASTA processing, is becoming a common procedure in current ASR. Such temporal processing effectively enhances some components of the modulation spectrum of speech while suppressing others. It is therefore important to know the relative importance of various components of the modulation spectrum of speech. In this study we report on the effect of band-pass filtering of the time trajectories of spectral envelopes on speech recognition. Results indicate the relative importance of different components of the modulation spectrum of speech for ASR.

Reference-contexts: Such processing effectively modifies the so-called modulation spectrum of speech [3]. It is therefore important to know the relative importance of various components of the modulation spectrum of speech for both human speech communication and for ASR. Cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) <ref> [1] </ref> suppresses the DC components of the time trajectories of the cepstrum to alleviate the effects of the convolutional noise introduced, e.g., by the frequency characteristics of the communications channel (additive in logarithmic spectrum or cepstrum). Such temporal processing effectively enhances some components of the modulation spectrum while suppressing others.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION In current automatic speech recognition (ASR), temporal processing of time trajectories in the logarithmic spectrum domain is becoming a common procedure. Such processing effectively modifies the so-called modulation spectrum of speech <ref> [3] </ref>. It is therefore important to know the relative importance of various components of the modulation spectrum of speech for both human speech communication and for ASR. <p> Such temporal processing effectively enhances some components of the modulation spectrum while suppressing others. Thus, in dynamic features [2], components of the modulation spectrum around 10 Hz are typically enhanced while lower and higher components are suppressed <ref> [3] </ref>. RelAtive SpecTrAl processing (RASTA) [3] passes components of the modulation spectrum between about 1 and 12 Hz. <p> Such temporal processing effectively enhances some components of the modulation spectrum while suppressing others.

RelAtive SpecTrAl processing (RASTA) [3] passes components of the modulation spectrum between about 1 and 12 Hz. Perceptual experiments for Japanese syllables, conducted using band-pass filtered time trajectories of LPC cep-strum in the residual-exited LPC system, indicate the relative importance of various components of the modulation spectrum of speech for speech intelligibility [4].

Reference-contexts: Perceptual experiments for Japanese syllables, conducted using band-pass filtered time trajectories of LPC cep-strum in the residual-exited LPC system, indicate the relative importance of various components of the modulation spectrum of speech for speech intelligibility <ref> [4] </ref>. The results of these experiments suggest that most of the information necessary to preserve intelligibility is the range between 1 and 16 Hz. In this study we report the effect of similar filtering of the time trajectories of spectral envelopes on speech recognition. trajectories. 2. <p> Average differences in the recognition accuracy are shown in Figure 2. Here each bar indicates average improvement in ASR accuracy resulting from inclusion of a given modulation frequency band. For comparison, results of a similar evaluation using data from perceptual experiments <ref> [4] </ref> are also shown in Figure 2. The results indicate that most of the useful linguistic information is in the modulation frequency components between 1 Hz and 16 Hz, with the dominant component at around 4 Hz.

Reference-contexts: The test data, uttered by 5 male native speakers, were sampled at 11.025 kHz (also 16 bit quantization). These tokens were passed through a FFT-based filter bank and separated logarithmically into 16 equal parts every 12.5 ms. These were converted to logarithmic values by the Lin-Log function <ref> [5] </ref>, y = log (1 + J x); (1) where J is a signal-dependent positive constant. The amplitude-warping transform (1) is linear-like for J t 1 and logarithmic-like for J 1. After this process, the time trajectories were filtered with a 511-tap FIR filter.

Reference-contexts: Black rectangles indicate a decrease in the recognition performance caused by including a given modulation frequency band. The range below 2 Hz or above 8 Hz becomes less important in noisy environments. Especially, the range below 1 Hz noticeably degrades the recognition accuracy in noisy environments. Greenberg <ref> [6] </ref> suggests that speech can withstand channel decorrelations as long as about 120 ms without significant loss in intelligibility. This would be consistent with our results which show that the range of modulation frequency between 2 Hz and 8 Hz (125 ms) is always important in any environment. 4.
