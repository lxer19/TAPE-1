Abstract: A ULV decomposition of a matrix A of order n is a decomposition of the form A = ULV H , where U and V are orthogonal matrices and L is a lower triangular matrix. When A is approximately of rank k, the decomposition is rank revealing if the last n k rows of L are small. This paper presents algorithms for updating a rank-revealing ULV decomposition. The algorithms run in O(n 2 ) time, and can be implemented on a linear array of processors to run in O(n) time.

Reference-contexts: It costs more to deflate the URV decomposition if we insist on refinement steps. On the other hand the updating algorithm for the URV decomposition is much simpler. In fact, when there is no change of rank, it amounts to the usual LINPACK updating algorithm SCHUD <ref> [2] </ref>. Only experience with real-life problems will tell us under what circumstances one decomposition is to be preferred to the other. ULV Updating 7 Both sets of algorithms are stable and reliable. They are stable because they use orthogonal transformations straightforwardly with no additional implicit relations.

Reference-contexts: The reader is assumed to be familiar with plane rotations, which are discussed in most texts on numerical linear algebra (e.g., see <ref> [3, 5, 8] </ref>). We begin by reducing w the nth unit vector e n . The reduction is illustrated in the component of w with a check over it.

Reference-contexts: The first step is to determine a vector w of norm one such that ! = kw H Lk approximates the smallest singular value of L. This can be done by using any of a number of reliable condition estimators <ref> [4] </ref>. If ! is greater than a prescribed tolerance, then there is nothing to be done. Otherwise, we must modify L by unitary transformations so that its last row becomes small.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of the URV decomposition over the more familiar singular value decomposition is that it can be updated when a row is added to A. The updating procedure, which is described in <ref> [6] </ref>, requires O (n 2 ) operations and preserves the rank-revealing character of the decomposition. <p> Consequently the last n k singular values of A are less than or equal to kEk, and the corresponding left singular vectors form an approximate null space whose residual has norm less than or equal to kEk. Thus V 2 is not the best available approximate null space. In <ref> [6] </ref> this problem was circumvented by including a refinement step that reduces the size of H. The properties of this refinement have been analyzed in [7]. In experiments with the MUSIC algorithm for direction of arrival estimation, the refinement was found to improve the results [1]. <p> ULV Updating 7 Both sets of algorithms are stable and reliable. They are stable because they use orthogonal transformations straightforwardly with no additional implicit relations. They are as reliable as their underlying condition estimators. In <ref> [6] </ref> we showed that the algorithms for the URV decomposition could, in principle, be parallelized on a linear array of processors. The same is true of the algorithms for updating a ULV decomposition.
