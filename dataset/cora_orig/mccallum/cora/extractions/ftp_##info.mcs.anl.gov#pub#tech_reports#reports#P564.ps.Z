Abstract: Many problems from science and engineering require the computation of a rank-revealing QR factorization of a matrix. We have developed a new algorithm based on Chandrasekaran and Ipsen's algorithm, with two advantages over it: First, our algorithm is much faster since we modify the main loop to accelerate its convergence and avoid the useless steps. Second, we apply a technique, suggested by Pan and Tang, that ensures termination, achieves the desired bounds, and fits into our theoretical studies.

Reference-contexts: Since this process is very expensive (cubic), we use the subalgorithm Chan-II, which can be efficiently implemented if estimators are used. Specifically, we use the incremental condition estimator developed by Bischof <ref> [7] </ref>, thus obtaining a quadratic cost, much smaller than the former. In theory, the substitution of Chan-II allows the possibility of a failure in the RRQR, that is, the rank will be revealed only if the estimates are accurate.

Reference-contexts: A list of problems where the RRQR factorization can be applied, as well as a a complete overview of the classical algorithms for computing it, can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Here we will focus on the most recent studies. In 1992 Hong and Pan proved that an optimal RRQR factorization is able to produce estimates of two consecutive singular values that are accurate up to a factor proportional to the matrix size [23]. <p> Main-Loop Reorganization: The main loop of our new algorithm, clearly different from Chandrasekaran and Ipsen's algorithm, gives a faster convergence rate by avoiding the final steps that do not improve the column ordering. Recently, Bischof and Quintana <ref> [8, 25] </ref> developed and implemented a new block algorithm for computing the RRQR factorization based on our method. <p> We expect that this factor will grow higher for larger matrices. Because of the advantages of the new algorithm, it has been used by Bischof and Quintana <ref> [8] </ref> to develop a new block algorithm for computing the RRQR factorization. This block algorithm has shown a much higher performance than the traditional QR factorization with column pivoting.

The former subalgorithm is based on the QR factorization with column pivoting <ref> [10] </ref>. The latter is based on Gragg and Stewart's algorithm [19]. Chandrasekaran and Ipsen proposed in their work the use of suffix -I for those algorithms that work on the lower right blocks of R, and suffix -II for those that work on the upper left block.

Reference-contexts: This result is important because it shows that the RRQR may reliably reveal the numerical rank of any matrix. Unfortunately, Hong and Pan did not present a method for constructing such a factorization. Shortly thereafter, two theoretic approximations were developed: the first by Chandrasekaran and Ipsen <ref> [14] </ref>, the second one by Pan and Tang [24]. The main inconvenience of the former is its seriality, whereas the latter shows a higher degree of parallelism. On the other hand, Chandrasekaran and Ipsen's algorithm reaches tighter bounds than does the algorithm of Pan and Tang. <p> However, in practice since these are accurate, we have excluded that value. We present here a variant of Chandrasekaran and Ipsen's algorithm that implements Pan and Tang's method for solving the termination problem. Our algorithm is faster than Chandrasekaran and Ipsen's <ref> [14] </ref>, halts, achieves the desired bounds, and fits into our theoretical studies. This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the original algorithm of Chandrasekaran and Ipsen and then present our new algorithm. In Section 3, we analyze the new algorithm theoretically.

Specifically, we have solved the termination problem by means of a technique similar to that of Pan and Tang <ref> [24] </ref>. The solution is based on the use of a tolerance parameter f , 0 &lt; f 1. The pivoting technique of the subalgorithms (Golub-I, etc.) assigns a weight to each column and then selects that column having the greatest weight as the pivot column.
