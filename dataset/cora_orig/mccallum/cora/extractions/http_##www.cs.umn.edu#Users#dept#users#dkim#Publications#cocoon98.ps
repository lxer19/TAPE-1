Abstract: This paper investigates multirate multicast Clos switching network which is nonblocking in a wide sense, where a compatible mul-ticast request is guaranteed to be routed without disturbing the existing network if all requests have conformed to a given routing scheme. The routing strategy discovers (2:875n 1) min(k + r 1=k ) + 1 middle switches sufficient for any multirate multicast requests, whereas strictly nonblocking multirate switching networks requires infinite number of middle switches if the range of weights can be widely distributed. This paper also shows that Yang and Masson's nonblocking multicast Clos network for pure circuit switching is rearrangeable for multirate multicast communication if each weight is chosen from a given finite set of integer multiplicity. Note that a general rearrangeability of multirate Clos network even for point-to-point communications has not been known yet. In our work, the number of middle switches only depends on the configuration of the switch itself but not on the patterns of connection requests, which is critically advisable to construct large scale switching networks.

Reference-contexts: A network is said to be nonblocking in a wide-sense if a new request can be satisfied without interfering the existing network configuration under a condition that all requests comply to a given routing algorithm. Benes <ref> [1] </ref> proved a Clos network C (n; 2; m) is wide-sense nonblocking in circuit switching if m = b3n=2c.

Reference-contexts: mean is not less than the minimum of a sequence so that the mini mum m 00 can be obtained from (2), (3) and (4) as m 00 p To provide a general multirate multicast switching networks, we extend a routing algorithm called a quota scheme from Gao and Hwang <ref> [4] </ref>. Connection requests are partitioned into large calls (C L ) and small calls (C S ) by their weights.
