Abstract: Competitive analysis is concerned with minimizing a relative measure of performance. When applied to financial trading strategies, competitive analysis leads to the development of strategies with minimum relative performance risk. This approach is too inflexible. Many investors are interested in managing their risk: they may be willing to increase their risk for some form of reward. They may also have some forecast of the future. In this paper, we extend competitive analysis to provide a framework in which investors can develop optimal trading strategies based on their risk tolerance and forecast. We first define notions of risk and reward that are smooth extensions of classical competitive analysis. We then illustrate our ideas using the ski-rental problem, and analyze a financial game using the risk-reward framework.

Reference-contexts: Our risk-reward framework blends the two approaches. A conservative measure is used to select a set of "near-optimal" algorithms and then assumptions are made so as to select an optimal algorithm from this reduced set. In this paper, we specifically study the unidirectional conversion problem of El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. In this problem, an online investor wishes to convert a given amount of dollars to yen over a specified number of days. Each day, the investor is offered an exchange rate at which he may convert dollars to yen. El-Yaniv et al. [2] find an optimal competitive online algorithm for <p> unidirectional conversion problem of El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [2] </ref>.

On the other hand, most analysis in computer science focuses on worst case performance. <p> the maximum reward of r ? = 2, and for t = 1 the restricted ratio reduces to the optimal competitive ratio and so the reward is 1. 4 Unidirectional Trading in a Risk-Reward Framework In this section we use the risk-reward framework to analyze the unidirectional conversion problem of <ref> [2] </ref>. We will use the following notation: T i Trading period i. e i The exchange rate offered in period T i . This is the amount of yen per dollar. The higher the the numerical value of the exchange rate, the cheaper the yen. <p> This means that the general unidirectional trading problem is not interesting, because reasonably low competitive ratios are not possible. To continue we need to make some assumptions about the exchange rate. One of the scenarios that El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [2] </ref> consider is that the exchange rate is bounded, m e i M , for i = 1; : : : ; n, and that the online investor knows the bounds m; M . Will will adopt this assumption. <p> Thus, TS2 will achieve more yen than TS1 should the forecast come true. 6 In the rest of this paper, we restrict ourselves to a certain subset of exchange rates, that does not invalidate the results, but allows for a simpler analysis. By similar arguments to those made in <ref> [2] </ref>, we can show that we need only consider exchange rate sequences of the form mtr ? 1 &lt; e 1 &lt; e 2 &lt; &lt; e k &lt; M and e k+1 = e k+2 = = m, for some k in [1::n]. <p> 5 Further Work Many questions remain, some of which are: * Analyzing the unidirectional conversion problem using more complex forecasts, such as F = fhe 1 ; : : : ; e n ijm e i M g, or those used by technical analysts. * The bidirectional conversion problem of <ref> [2] </ref>, where an investor may convert dollars to yen and yen to dollars, has an optimal competitive ratio that is exponential. Can the risk-reward framework be used to allow a more interesting analysis? * We have shown how nonprobabilistic assumptions about the input can be utilized in developing online algorithms.

Reference-contexts: j = max ij e i then the maximum exchange rate is U n , and so the online investor wishes to minimize the competitive ratio r = sup d 0 U n i=1 s i e i subject to the constraints: 1. 8i; s i 0 P n In <ref> [3] </ref>, El-Yaniv et al. show that if the exchange rate and the number of trading periods is unbounded, then the optimal competitive ratio is also unbounded. This means that the general unidirectional trading problem is not interesting, because reasonably low competitive ratios are not possible.

Reference-contexts: Competitive analysis compares the performance of online algorithms to a benchmark (optimal o*ine) algorithm [10]. Probabilistic analysis compares the expected performance of online algorithms under the assumption that the inputs are drawn from a known probability distribution (see, for example, <ref> [4] </ref>). Competitive analysis of online algorithms has been criticized as being too conservative. Probabilistic analysis has been criticized as making too strong assumptions (although the statistical adversary of [7] attempts to remedy this by weakening the assumptions made). Our risk-reward framework blends the two approaches.

Reference-contexts: The second characteristic is also not universally agreed upon: some definitions tie risk to the probability of the outcomes, while others see this as a measure, and not a definition, of risk. The definition we will follow is that of risk as the "exposure to a chance of loss" <ref> [6] </ref>. There are three components to this definition: * Exposure to Loss: There has to be a potential loss of some amount. <p> MacCrimmon and Wehrung <ref> [6] </ref> introduce a basic risk paradigm as the basis for studying risk. In their model there are two actions: a riskless action that leads to a certain outcome, and a risky action that leads to one of two outcomes; one is a gain, the other is a loss.

Reference-contexts: the reward should the forecast come true, but which does not exceed the investor's risk level for any input sequence. 2 Motivation of the Framework: What is Risk? We introduce the risk-reward framework by presenting a brief introduction to the concepts, perceptions, measurement and management of risk as discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Most definitions of risk share two characteristics: * Risk involves some form of negative outcome. * Risk does not involve the probability of outcomes.
