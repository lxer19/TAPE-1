Abstract: In Technicolor models the production of the ! T can be large. The decay ! T ! fl T followed by T ! b b is allowed, giving the signature flb b. We use the 85 pb 1 Ib photon data sample to exclude a significant part of parameter space.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We develop a flb b data sample to search for the ! T . This data sample is is based on the photon sample of our SUSY search <ref> [1] </ref>. Many of the techniques used here were developed for that analysis and described in more detail in Ref. [1]. In the next section is a summary of the Technicolor model. Following that, we describe data set and the cuts used to make it. <p> 1 Introduction We develop a flb b data sample to search for the ! T . This data sample is is based on the photon sample of our SUSY search <ref> [1] </ref>. Many of the techniques used here were developed for that analysis and described in more detail in Ref. [1]. In the next section is a summary of the Technicolor model. Following that, we describe data set and the cuts used to make it. Next we conclude that the sensitivity does not improve requiring a b-tag on the second jet. We present an estimate of the background. <p> A Monte Carlo with these parameters, a 210 GeV ! T and a 110 GeV T , will be used as a baseline model. 3 Data Sample In our SUSY search for a light stop in flb6 E t <ref> [1] </ref> we define the standard set of photon ID cuts used to make this sample. The cuts are repeated in this note in Appendix B. We strip events with a central photon, E t &gt; 25 GeV, from the GHIB Ib inclusive photon sample. <p> We will not be using the calculation to do a background subtraction. 2 The same methods in Ref. <ref> [1] </ref> are used here. A straight calculation of SECVTX Method 1 sounds like an attractive way to estimate the background but it may not be reliable since photon events will have a different heavy-flavor fraction than the QCD jets that the method was calibrated on. <p> Instead we have to use a Method 2 background estimate. Details of the calculation can be found in Ref. <ref> [1] </ref>. The number of fake photons is estimated using the CES-CPR method and are assigned a 15% systematic error. Real photons with mistags are estimated from the pre-tagged sample by applying the CES-CPR weighting and the SECVTX negative (fake) tagging prediction. <p> To find the efficiency at each point in the M ! T M T plane, we run the Monte Carlo, PYTHIA 6.1 with QFL'. Corrections are included for the photon trigger and the photon ID as in reference <ref> [1] </ref>. The width of the mass window is measured in the baseline sample to be 90% efficient. Total efficiencies, not including branching ratio, are 3% at the lower masses and 10% at large masses. <p> We find 7% for ISR and and 4% for FSR. * Following reference [3] we take 5% for the choice of PDF. * Jet energy scale. We varied the energy by 5% and find the acceptance varies by 6%. * Photon ID efficiency. We take 14% from reference <ref> [1] </ref>. * Luminosity, 8%. * B-tagging efficiency, 9% as in reference [4]. * Monte Carlo statistics, 4%.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we fit the data for a signal peak and set limits on fi BR as a function of the ! T mass and an exclusion region in the ! T T mass plane. 2 Technicolor Model In the Technicolor model of Ref. <ref> [2] </ref>, techni-isospin is expected to be an approximate symmetry so the T and ! T will have approximately the same mass. They will also be produced at about the same rate through Vector Meson Dominance.

Reference-contexts: The charges of the constituent quarks are Q U = 4=3 and Q D = 1=3 and the number of technicolors is N T C = 4. Finally, we include a K-factor correction of 1.3 to the cross section as evaluated in Ref. <ref> [3] </ref> for the T . The authors of the model agreed that the K-factor should also apply to the ! T cross section. We use the CTEQ4L p.d.f. (see Appendix A). The widths of the ! T and the T are expected to be much smaller than our resolutions. <p> We then take the more conservative of the two results. * Initial and final state radiation. We turn each off, one at a time, and take half of the difference. We find 7% for ISR and and 4% for FSR. * Following reference <ref> [3] </ref> we take 5% for the choice of PDF. * Jet energy scale. We varied the energy by 5% and find the acceptance varies by 6%. * Photon ID efficiency.
