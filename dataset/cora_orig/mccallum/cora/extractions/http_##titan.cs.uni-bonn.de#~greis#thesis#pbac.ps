Reference-contexts: In this document we will suggest a technique for using PBAC with aggregation and we will evaluate out technique based on the additional workload and overhead as compared with MBAC-based aggregation techniques. Our work is directly based on the suggestions in <ref> [1] </ref>, but should be applicable to any other aggregation techniques as well. 2 Aggregation with PBAC In an aggregating region, only the edge routers (or to be more exact, the ingress routers) know how much bandwidth has been reserved for a particular data flow.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Flow aggregation has been proposed as a solution for RSVP's scalability problems. The most important approaches to aggregation ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>) are based on measurement-based admission control (MBAC) [3] which allows for the omission of soft state in the interior routers of an aggregating domain. However, measurement-based admission control has certain flaws which may lead to overreserva-tions on links in the network under certain conditions.
