Abstract: Let A be a Las Vegas algorithm, i.e., A is a randomized algorithm that always produces the correct answer when it stops but whose running time is a random variable. We consider the problem of minimizing the expected time required to obtain an answer from A using strategies which simulate A as follows: run A for a fixed amount of time t 1 , then run A independently for a fixed amount of time t 2 , etc. The simulation stops if A completes its execution during any of the runs. Let S = (t 1 ; t 2 ; : : :) be a strategy, and let ` A = inf S T (A; S), where T (A; S) is the expected value of the running time of the simulation of A under strategy S . We describe a simple universal strategy S univ , with the property that, for any algorithm A, T (A; S univ ) = O(` A log(` A )). Furthermore, we show that this is the best performance that can be achieved, up to a constant factor, by any universal strategy. y Current address: International Computer Science Institute, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley CA 94704, luby@icsi.berkeley.edu.

Reference-contexts: Of course, our results apply equally to any Las Vegas algorithm. This paper is similar in spirit to recent work of Alt et al <ref> [1] </ref>, who consider simulation strategies for Las Vegas algorithms with the goal of minimizing the tail probability of the simulation, i.e., the probability that the simulation runs for more than t steps. <p> Although tail probabilities are not the main focus of this paper, it turns out that our universal strategy achieves tail probabilities that are in many cases stronger than those obtained in <ref> [1] </ref>, and in no case qualitatively weaker. In both papers, the tail probability is essentially of the form exp (t=ff) , but in [1] ff is given in terms of the expectation E [T A (x)] , whereas in our paper it is given in terms of the quantity ` A <p> not the main focus of this paper, it turns out that our universal strategy achieves tail probabilities that are in many cases stronger than those obtained in <ref> [1] </ref>, and in no case qualitatively weaker. In both papers, the tail probability is essentially of the form exp (t=ff) , but in [1] ff is given in terms of the expectation E [T A (x)] , whereas in our paper it is given in terms of the quantity ` A (x) , which is never larger than E [T A (x)] . (For the precise bounds, see Theorem 6 in Section 3.) In <p> From the above proof, we also immediately obtain the following exponential tail bound on the running time of S univ . Theorem 6 The probability that S univ runs for more than t steps is at most expft=64` p log (t)g: (13) 7 Remark: In a recent paper <ref> [1] </ref>, Alt et al study strategies for minimizing the tail probability in simulations of Las Vegas algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Our interest in this problem was sparked by work presented by Wolfgang Ertel at ICSI on the speedup of Las Vegas-type theorem proving algorithms using parallel processors <ref> [2] </ref>. Ertel considers strategies of the form: run A (x) in parallel using k processors and stop when any one of the k runs terminates. In his case, the algorithm A (x) consists of random search of a (highly unbalanced) tree.
