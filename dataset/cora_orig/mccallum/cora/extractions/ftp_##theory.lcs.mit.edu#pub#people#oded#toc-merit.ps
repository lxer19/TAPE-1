Abstract: In this essay we provide an assessment of TOC as a fundamental scientific discipline. We focus on the important scientific role of TOC, and on its great achievements, productivity and impact (both scientific and technological) so far.

Reference-contexts: To be on the safe side, here is some evidence. An excellent demonstration of the the fundamental nature of TOC was provided by Papadim-itriou <ref> [1] </ref> in his survey on the impact of NP-completeness on other sciences. Papadimitriou lists about 20 diverse scientific disciplines which were unsuccessfully struggling with some of their internal questions and came to recognize their intrinsic complexity when realizing that these questions are, in some form, NP-complete.
