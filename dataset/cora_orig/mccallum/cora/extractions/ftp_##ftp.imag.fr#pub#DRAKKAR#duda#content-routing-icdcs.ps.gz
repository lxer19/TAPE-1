Title: Content Routing in a Network of WAIS Servers  
Author: Andrzej Duda Mark A. Sheldon 
Affiliation: Programming Systems Research Group MIT Laboratory for Computer Science  
Abstract: Locating and accessing information in a large distributed system is a difficult problem of growing importance. This paper reports on our experience building and using a prototype system for transparent, user-guided associative access to the contents of a large, distributed set of WAIS servers. Our system is based on content routing, an architecture that makes use of content labels for locating and accessing information in large distributed systems [12]. Our content router for WAIS servers is implemented as a Semantic File System that constructs content labels from WAIS source and catalog files. The content router guides locating documents by suggesting terms that frequently appear with a given query term in document headlines. Sufficiently narrowed queries are routed to WAIS servers and processed in parallel. We have successfully used our content router to locate documents on a large number of WAIS servers. Along with demonstrating the feasibility of distributed finding in a large network of information servers, the prototype shows interactive performance limited primarily by the processing time at WAIS servers.

Reference-contexts: Network navigation systems such as the Gopher system <ref> [1] </ref> and the Word-Wide Web [3] provide a means for organizing servers into a structure that allows navigating among remote servers and browsing their contents. If the user knows what to look for and where the resource might be located, then interesting resources can be discovered.

The knowledge about existing sources is acquired by exchanging messages with neighboring hosts. The Information Brokers of the MITL Gold project <ref> [2] </ref> share many of our goals. However, Information Brokers do not provide access to objects directly. Rather, they return descriptions of an object's location and the method that may be used to retrieve the object.

Reference-contexts: User queries are translated into commands on the different systems. However, there is no support for the automatic selection of relevant databases for a user's query. The Distributed Indexing mechanism <ref> [4] </ref> is based on precom-puted indices of databases that summarize the holdings on particular topics of other databases. The architecture has a three layer fixed structure that is suitable for bibliographic databases, but it is not flexible enough for content based access to general information servers.

Reference-contexts: These systems provide facilities for individual servers that respond to queries. There is no support for query routing. Network-based information retrieval systems provide associative access to information on remote servers. We have already introduced WAIS. The Archie system <ref> [5] </ref> polls a fixed set of FTP sites on the Internet. A query yields a set of host/filename pairs which is then used to manually retrieve the relevant files. The Conit system [9, 10] provides a uniform user interface to a large number of databases accessible from several retrieval systems.

Reference-contexts: When a sufficiently narrow query is formulated, it is routed to relevant collections. This paper reports our experience building and using a prototype content router for WAIS servers. Our content router for WAIS servers is implemented as a Semantic File System <ref> [6] </ref> that can be mounted by any NFS client. For our initial tests, we chose to construct content labels from WAIS source and catalog files. WAIS source files are very brief descriptions of information sources, often listed at a special directory of servers. <p> We therefore chose to experiment with very simple content labels that consisted of disjunctions of attributes obtained from the individual WAIS source and catalog files. Our prototype uses the Semantic File System (SFS) path name interface described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The SFS pathname interface currently supports only conjunctive queries, though the underlying SFS query processing software does support arbitrary boolean queries. For the presentation here, we have used a straightforward transcription of our sessions into a more readable syntax.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to locating and accessing information in a large distributed system is based on content rout-ing, which we have described in a previous paper <ref> [12] </ref>. A content routing system (CRS) defines a distributed architecture for content-based navigation and associative access to documents. A content routing system is organized as a network of servers called content routers that present a single query based image of a distributed information system. <p> The histograms serve for estimating the result size of each query that is used to choose appropriate information servers for searching. The architecture of a content routing system and a brief description of the first prototype is given in our previous paper <ref> [12] </ref>. The content routing architecture combines efficient associative access to distributed information servers with query refinement. Key advances offered by the system include scalability, usability and efficiency. The present work implements the content routing architecture in a large network of WAIS servers. <p> For a more complete description of the data model and semantics, see <ref> [12] </ref>. System organization A content routing system may be thought of as an extension to a traditional information retrieval system. It provides associative access to a set of documents.
