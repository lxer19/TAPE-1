Reference-contexts: Energy transfer in multi-link systems has received much attention, and many theories have been put forward to explain the transfer of energy fractions within and across links <ref> [1] </ref>, [14]. Aleshinsky [1], [2] in a series of papers, discussed mechanical energy expenditure in multi-link systems.

Thus, we prefer a simpler and more easily quantifiable term like the total applied torque. 4 Dynamics In this section, we analyze the dynamics of a two-link system in order to derive general properties relating different whip-type motions. <p> We then describe how our control methods can be extended to multi-link chains. Energy Transfer The total energy in a link chain is distributed across its component links.

Reference-contexts: Energy transfer in multi-link systems has received much attention, and many theories have been put forward to explain the transfer of energy fractions within and across links [1], [14]. Aleshinsky [1], <ref> [2] </ref> in a series of papers, discussed mechanical energy expenditure in multi-link systems. He proposed quantitative measures for estimating mechanical advantage gained in different types of motion where energy transformation from one form to another occurs. However, the most appropriate one for estimating mechanical effort expenditure is still hotly debated. <p> We then describe how our control methods can be extended to multi-link chains. Energy Transfer The total energy in a link chain is distributed across its component links. The action of joint forces, due to control moments at the articulations, promotes energy transfer within links [1]. Aleshinsky <ref> [2] </ref> substantiated this observation by deriving the energy balance equations for a linked system and showing that energy transformation from translational to rotational form occurs in a whip-type motion due to joint forces. 15 final angles and angular velocities are constrained to match the results of the cascading gain simulation shown <p> While our explanation is qualitative in nature, we believe quantitative experiments can be performed by measuring the energy transformation due to individual joint force components. In fact, it may be 17 very useful to measure quantitatively, using an index like the compensation coefficient as defined in <ref> [2] </ref>, the advantage gained by whip-type motions. This can be incorporated in dynamic simulation systems which permit the measurement of joint forces. Multi-link Systems Our methods can be used for simulating whip-type motions in multi-link chains too. The dynamics of multi-link chains is decidedly more complex.

Reference-contexts: However, it does not provide a general control framework for segmental motion. While it can produce beautiful animations of basketball playing and whip lashing, it does not use or capture the common characteristics of these motions. Armstrong <ref> [3] </ref> formulated a recursive solution for the dynamic parameters of linked figures. But controlling motion was not the primary consideration. Kinematic control using spacetime constraints [6], [20], [22] has found wide acceptance for interactive animation partly due to simplicity of specification.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present control algorithms for synthesizing whip-type motions in simulated robots. Both sport research and biomechanics literature are replete with descriptions of sequential segmental motion. The motion patterns of experienced athletes like javelin throwers [19], handball throwers [10] and karate masters <ref> [4] </ref> have been analyzed. Using computer analysis [19], it was observed that champion javelin throwers consistently accomplished a proper sequence of acceleration and deceleration of body segments, to achieve maximum velocity of release.

Reference-contexts: They used two link models for the appendages involved in the actions. Kreighbaum and Barthels [12] explain the mechanical advantage gained with the whip motion through the use of the law of conservation of angular momentum. Cochran and Stobbs <ref> [5] </ref> presented an empirical study of the golf swing using a mechanical model of the involved links and muscles. A detailed kinematic method was developed to analyze the racquet swing technique in [18]. <p> We assume that this initial configuration has been reached through a backswing phase which prepares the system for forward rotation. The backswing phase can be observed in many actions like the swinging of a golf club <ref> [5] </ref>. In the golf swing, a pause normally occurs at the top of the swing, between downswing and backswing, indicating that the angular velocities of the club and body (representing a two-link system) are approximately zero at that instant.

Reference-contexts: Given torque profiles, dynamic simulation systems <ref> [7] </ref> solve the above equations iteratively in order to obtain link accelerations, velocities, and orientations.

Using the above described control strategy, the motion of the two-link chain was simulated using the model-based dynamic simulator Newton <ref> [7] </ref>. Profiles of joint angles, angular velocities, joint torques, and the tip velocity are presented in figure 6. The 10 progressive nature of the movement is evident from the joint angle and angular velocity profiles.

Reference-contexts: While all the above schemes provide valuable insight into sequential segmental motion, they do not directly facilitate the development of related control algorithms for animation. On the other hand, animators and researchers in robotics have worked in simulating motion of linked figures. In this context, Isaacs and Cohen <ref> [8] </ref> created a system called DYNAMO.

Reference-contexts: Using computer analysis [19], it was observed that champion javelin throwers consistently accomplished a proper sequence of acceleration and deceleration of body segments, to achieve maximum velocity of release. Putnam [16] and Jorgensen <ref> [9] </ref> describe specific whip-type actions like kicking a ball and the swinging of golf clubs. They used two link models for the appendages involved in the actions. <p> We refer to this model as the n-link model where n refers to the number of moving links. This model is applicable for describing many actions like kicking, dismounting from a parallel bar in gymnastics [16], and the golf swing <ref> [9] </ref> (see Fig. 2). For instance, in an overhead throw, the moving links correspond to the legs, the torso, and the arms which act together as if they are a single chain. To simplify analysis, we assume motion in a gravity free environment. <p> The cascading gain value is initially small which causes the forward rotation of the second link to be delayed with respect to the movement of the first link. This delay models the hinderance phenomenon a lag in uncocking the distal joint - observed in the golf swing <ref> [9] </ref>. As the gain increases, we are effectively increasing the stiffness of the spring. Finally, the gain drops back to zero as joint 2 reaches its set point. The cascading gain controller was simulated with the two-link model previously described.

Reference-contexts: It is noted that proximal segments consistently reach lower maximal velocities at an earlier moment than distal segments <ref> [10] </ref>. It appears that this sequential motion is naturally preferred because of the mechanical advantage gained. This type of motion is called whip-type motion 1 .

Reference-contexts: High tip velocity is characteristic in athletic tasks that require transmission of energy to other objects. We also want to achieve high velocity with minimal effort so that we conserve resources, avoid potential damage from high strain, and maximize performance within the bounds of actuator output. In earlier work <ref> [11] </ref>, we presented two of our control methods without analysis of linkage dynamics. In this paper, we will study the dynamics of a linkage to derive properties governing diverse whip-type motions, and applications in multi-link systems. The general linkage model used in this paper is shown in figure 1. <p> It may seem a little counter-intuitive that the proximal link decelerates during high speed movements, however, as we shall see later, it is this deceleration that actually promotes energy conversion from translational to rotational energy in the distal link. It is shown in <ref> [11] </ref> that a control strategy in which both links are accelerating when maximal tip velocity is attained is much less efficient than a control method which achieves whip-type motion, for the same tip velocity.

Reference-contexts: We too will use this approach in generating an animation sequence of a linked system. We specify spacetime constraints that give the boundary conditions for throwing and then, using numerical optimization, compute a trajectory that minimizes an objective function based on effort expended <ref> [15] </ref>. The motion generated is smooth and consistent with human motion patterns. However, as a method of control, optimization is not always attractive. Optimization is implemented as iterative search which makes it inefficient. <p> The controller at joint i is termed t i . To evaluate the total effort required to produce a given motion, we use the sum of the squared torques applied to move the linkage [13], <ref> [15] </ref>. Thus, the total effort in moving an n-link system, evaluated over m equally spaced discrete time steps of size t, is given by: R = m j=1 i=1 i (t j )t (1) We call the measure R as the total applied torque (units of N m 2 s). <p> To evaluate the performance of the proportional and cascading gain controllers, we determined the locally optimal trajectory satisfying initial and final conditions of the motion determined with the cascading gain controller. The tool employed for optimal motion analysis is a software system called Optimizer <ref> [15] </ref>. Given a set of spacetime constraints and an initial sequence, Optimizer formulates a nonlinear least-squares problem which is solved with a version of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The constraints on our optimization problem were derived from the simulation results of the cascading gain controlled linkage.

Putnam [16] and Jorgensen [9] describe specific whip-type actions like kicking a ball and the swinging of golf clubs. <p> The motivation of using a stop at joint 1 comes from the observation that champion throwers achieve maximum velocity of release by stopping the bottom part of the body (the proximal segments) almost violently and subsequently accelerate the parts (the distal segments) closer to the ballistic object <ref> [19] </ref>. In Appendix A, we illustrate the effect of the stop on link kinematic parameters at the instant maximal tip velocity is achieved. The step control strategy is simple to implement and throws further light on whip-type motions.
