Abstract: In this report a number of new reproduction operators for genetic programming ( GP ) is introduced. These operators have in common that they link the genetic information to a position in the expression or program tree. The GP engine, that implements the operators, limits both the operator arity and tree depth. In this way the expression trees become restricted structures. The information linking together with the fixed structures, transform the GP engine into a genetic algorithm with even better performance than common GP . Without loss of effectivity, these adjustments to ordinary GP have the schema theory apply well to GP .
