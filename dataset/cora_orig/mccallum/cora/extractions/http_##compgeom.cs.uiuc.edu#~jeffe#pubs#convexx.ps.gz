Title: New Lower Bounds for Convex Hull Problems in Odd Dimensions  
Author: Jeff Erickson 
Address: Berkeley, CA 94720-1776  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California  
Abstract: We show that in the worst case, (n dd=2e1 + n log n) sided-ness queries are required to determine whether the convex hull of n points in IR d is simplicial, or to determine the number of convex hull facets. This lower bound matches known upper bounds in any odd dimension. Our result follows from a straightforward and completely constructive adversary argument. A key step in the proof is the construction of a quasi-simplicial n-vertex polytope with (n dd=2e1 ) degenerate facets. Using similar techniques, we also derive a constructive proof of Erickson and Seidel's lower bounds for detecting affine degeneracies in arbitrary dimensions. As a related result, we show that detecting simplicial convex hulls in IR d is dd=2eSUM-hard, in the sense of Gajentaan and Overmars. While it has been known for several years that d-dimensional convex hulls can have (n bd=2c ) facets, the previously best lower bound for either of the problems we consider is only (n log n).

Reference-contexts: An adversary can reintroduce any one of the degenerate facets, by moving its vertices back to their original position. Our argument is similar to earlier arguments of Erick-son and Seidel [12] and the author <ref> [11] </ref>. In contrast to these results, however, our proofs are completely constructive. In fact, our proof technique yields a much simpler constructive proof of Erickson and Seidel's lower bounds for affine degeneracy detection in arbitrary di-mensions. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains definitions and some preliminary results. <p> In particular, Theorem 3.1 tells us absolutely nothing about the four-dimensional case, since we already have a lower bound of (n log n) in all dimensions. In an earlier paper <ref> [11] </ref>, we derived an (n dr=2e ) lower bound for rSUM in the r-linear decision tree model, matching the non-uniform upper bounds. In this model, decisions are based on the signs of arbitrary affine combinations of r or fewer input variables. <p> If d 3, this lower bound holds even when the points are known in advance to be in convex position. We note in passing that adding allowable queries to our model allows us to prove nontrivial quadratic lower bounds for several 3SUM-hard problems. Previous techniques <ref> [12, 11] </ref> resulted in models that were too weak to solve many of these problems. 7.2 Circular Degeneracies We also easily prove the following related theorem first proven in [12]. A set of points in the plane is circularly degenerate if any four points lie on a circle. <p> Quadratic lower bounds for either the five-dimensional convex hull problem or the two-dimensional affine degeneracy problem in stronger models of computation would imply similar lower bounds for a number of other 3SUM-hard problems. While the lower bounds we prove here and in earlier papers <ref> [12, 11] </ref> are in fairly natural models, there are still 3SUM-hard problems that cannot even be solved in these models. For example, one of the simplest problems for which our techniques fail is finding the minimum area triangle determined by a set of points in the plane.

In the original proof of this theorem, the existence 1 at least if Bland's pivoting rule is used of the adversary set was proven nonconstructively. Here, we derive it explicitly. Theorem 7.1. <p> If d 3, this lower bound holds even when the points are known in advance to be in convex position.

We have been unable to generalize our constructive proof of the two-dimensional case to higher dimensions. A direct proof for the general case would follow from the construction of a set of numbers having (n d+1 ) (d + 2)-tuples in the zeroset of a certain symmetric polynomial. <p> Quadratic lower bounds for either the five-dimensional convex hull problem or the two-dimensional affine degeneracy problem in stronger models of computation would imply similar lower bounds for a number of other 3SUM-hard problems.

Reference-contexts: If we replace the weird moment curve by any polynomial curve, the orientation of a simplex is given by the sign of a Schur polynomial <ref> [23] </ref>. A determinantal formula for Schur polynomials was discovered by Jacobi in the mid-1800's [17]. The next lemma characterizes degenerate convex hull facets on the weird moment curve. The result is similar to Gale's evenness condition [14], which describes which vertices of a cyclic polytope form its facets. Lemma 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Real Convex Hull Al gorithms A large number of convex hull algorithms rely (or can be made to rely) exclusively on sidedness queries. These include the "gift-wrapping" algorithms of Chand and Kapur [6] and Swart [29], the "beneath-beyond" method of Seidel <ref> [24] </ref>, Clarkson and Shor's [10] and Seidel's [27] randomized incremental algorithms, Chazelle's worst-case optimal algorithm [7], and the recursive partial-order algorithm of Clarkson [9]. Seidel's "shelling" algorithm [26] and the space-efficient gift-wrapping algorithms of Avis and Fukuda 1 [2] and Rote [22] require only sidedness queries and second-order comparisons.

Reference-contexts: In fact, we can allow the input points to be pre-sorted in any finite number of fixed directions. Seidel describes a similar result in three dimensions <ref> [25, Theorem 5] </ref>. We emphasize that the directions in which these comparisons are made must be fixed in advance.

Reference-contexts: Since an n-vertex polytope in IR d can have (n bd=2c ) facets [31], Chazelle's algorithm is optimal in the worst case. Several faster algorithms are known when the output size is also considered; see for example <ref> [4, 5, 9, 10, 18, 26] </ref>. In this paper, we consider convex hull problems for which the output size is a single integer, or even a single bit, although the convex hull itself may be large. <p> These include the "gift-wrapping" algorithms of Chand and Kapur [6] and Swart [29], the "beneath-beyond" method of Seidel [24], Clarkson and Shor's [10] and Seidel's [27] randomized incremental algorithms, Chazelle's worst-case optimal algorithm [7], and the recursive partial-order algorithm of Clarkson [9]. Seidel's "shelling" algorithm <ref> [26] </ref> and the space-efficient gift-wrapping algorithms of Avis and Fukuda 1 [2] and Rote [22] require only sidedness queries and second-order comparisons. Matousek [20] and Chan [4] improve the running times of these algorithms (in an output-sensitive sense), by finding the extreme points more quickly.

Reference-contexts: If we represent the points of IR d in homogeneous coordinates, a projective transformation is equivalent to a linear transformation of IR d+1 . In Stolfi's two-sided projective model <ref> [28] </ref>, projective maps preserve (or reverse) the orientation of every simplex in IR d , and thus preserve the combinatorial structure of convex hulls. See Chapter 14 of [28]. Let X be the set of numbers described in the proof of Lemma 4.1. <p> In Stolfi's two-sided projective model <ref> [28] </ref>, projective maps preserve (or reverse) the orientation of every simplex in IR d , and thus preserve the combinatorial structure of convex hulls. See Chapter 14 of [28]. Let X be the set of numbers described in the proof of Lemma 4.1. We call an algebraic query allowable if for some projective transformation , the configuration (! d (X)) is nondegenerate with respect to that query. Our choice of terminology is justified by the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: Over twenty years ago, Graham described an algorithm that constructs the convex hull of n points in the plane in O (n log n) time [15]. The same running time was first achieved in three dimensions by Preparata and Hong [21]. Yao <ref> [30] </ref> proved a lower bound of (n log n) on the complexity of identifying the convex hull vertices, in the quadratic decision tree model. <p> This matches known upper bounds when d is odd [7]. The only lower bound previously known for either of these problems is (n log n), following from the techniques of Yao <ref> [30] </ref> and Ben-Or [3]. Our lower bounds follow from a straightforward adversary argument. We start by constructing a set whose convex hull contains a large number of independent degenerate facets.

Reference-contexts: Chazelle [7] describes an algorithm for constructing convex hulls in IR d in time O (n bd=2c + n log n). Since an n-vertex polytope in IR d can have (n bd=2c ) facets <ref> [31] </ref>, Chazelle's algorithm is optimal in the worst case. Several faster algorithms are known when the output size is also considered; see for example [4, 5, 9, 10, 18, 26]. <p> Section 7 contains some related results. Finally, in Section 8, we summarize and suggest directions for further research. 2 Geometric Preliminaries 2.1 Definitions We begin by reviewing basic terminology. For a more detailed introduction to the theory of convex polytopes, we refer the reader to Ziegler <ref> [31] </ref> or Grunbaum [16]. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains it. A polytope is the convex hull of a finite set of points. <p> easily observe that the polytope conv (! d (X)) has (n r ) degenerate facets, each of which has ! d (2n) as a vertex. fl This result is the best possible when d is odd, since an odd dimensional n-vertex polytope has at most O (n (d1)=2 ) facets <ref> [31] </ref>. In the case where d is even, the best known upper bound is O (n d=2 ), which is a factor of n bigger than the result we prove here. We conjecture that this upper bound is tight.
