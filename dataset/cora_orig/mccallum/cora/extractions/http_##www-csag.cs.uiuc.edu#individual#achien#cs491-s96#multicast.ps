Title: An Architecture for Wide-Area Multicast Routing  
Author: Stephen Deering (Xerox), Deborah Estrin (USC), Dino Farinacci (cisco), Van Jacobson (LBL), Ching-Gung Liu (USC), Liming Wei (USC) 
Abstract: Existing multicast routing mechanisms were intended for use within regions where a group is widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When group members, and senders to those group members, are distributed sparsely across a wide area, these schemes are not efficient; data packets or membership report information are occasionally sent over many links that do not lead to receivers or senders, respectively. We have developed a multicast routing architecture that efficiently establishes distribution trees across wide area internets, where many groups will be sparsely represented. Efficiency is measured in terms of the state, control message processing, and data packet processing, required across the entire network in order to deliver data packets to the members of the group. Our Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) architecture: (a) maintains the traditional IP multicast service model of receiver-initiated membership; (b) can be configured to adapt to different multicast group and network characteristics; (c) is not dependent on a specific unicast routing protocol; and (d) uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying network conditions and group dynamics. The robustness, flexibility, and scaling properties of this architecture make it well suited to large heterogeneous inter-networks.

Reference-contexts: Senders simply use that address as the destination address of a packet to reach all members of the group. The separation of senders and receivers allows any host|member or non-member|to send to a group. A group membership protocol <ref> [5] </ref> is used for routers to learn the existence of members on their directly attached subnetworks. This receiver-initiated join procedure has very good scaling properties; as the group grows, it becomes more likely that a new receiver will be able to splice onto a nearby branch of the distribution tree. <p> From this point on we refer to such a host as a receiver, R, (or member) of the group G. When a designated router (DR) 8 <ref> [5] </ref> receives a report for a new group G, it checks to see if it has RP address (es) associated with G 9 .

Reference-contexts: In the case of link-state protocols, changes of group membership on a subnetwork are detected by one of the routers directly attached to that subnetwork, and that router broadcasts the information to all other routers in the same routing domain <ref> [6] </ref>. Each router maintains an up-to-date image of the domain's topology through the unicast link-state routing protocol. Upon receiving a multicast data packet, the router uses the topology information and the group membership information to determine the shortest-path tree (SPT) from the packet's source subnetwork to its destination group members.

Distance-vector multicast routing protocols construct multicast distribution trees using variants of Reverse Path Forwarding <ref> [8] </ref>. When the first data packet is sent to a group from a particular source subnetwork, and a router receiving this packet has no knowledge about the group, the router forwards the incoming packet out all interfaces except the incoming interface 1 . <p> Also if the arriving data packet does not come through the interface that the router uses to send packets to the source of the data packet, the data packet is silently dropped; thus the term Reverse-Path Forwarding (RPF) <ref> [8] </ref>. When a router attached to a leaf subnetwork, receives a data packet addressed to a new group, if it finds no members present on its attached subnetworks, it will send a prune message upstream toward the source of the data packet.

Reference-contexts: However, periodically, the source's packets will be broadcast throughout the entire internet when the pruned-off branches time out. Thus far we have motivated our design by contrasting it to the traditional densely-distributed-membership IP multi-cast routing protocols. More recently, the Core Based Tree (CBT) protocol <ref> [10] </ref> was proposed to address similar scaling (a) (b) problems. CBT uses a single delivery tree for each group, rooted at a "core" router and shared by all senders to the group. As desired for sparse groups, CBT does not exhibit the occasional broadcasting or flooding behavior of earlier protocols.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the packets traveling from Y to Z will not travel via the shortest path used by unicast packets between Y and Z. We need to know the kind of degradations a core-based tree can incur in average networks. David Wall <ref> [11] </ref> proved that the bound on maximum delay of an optimal core-based tree (which he called a center-based tree) is 2 times the shortest-path delay.

In each network, there were 300 active groups all having 40 members, of which 32 members were also senders. <p> B The capability to support different tree types is the fundamental difference between PIM and CBT. There are other significant protocol engineering differences as well 4 . 3 A more complete analysis of these tradeoffs can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 Two obvious engineering tradeoffs are: 1. Soft state versus explicit reliability mechanism: CBT uses explicit hop-by-hop mechanisms to achieve reliable delivery of control messages.

Reference-contexts: Even when a group has an associated RP, it may be that some outgoing and incoming interfaces do not require PIM sparse mode, but are handled using a dense mode scheme such as MOSPF, DVMRP or a dense mode variant of PIM <ref> [13] </ref>. In this case the router will flag individual interfaces as dense or sparse mode, to allow differential treatment of different interfaces. For the sake of clarity, we will ignore these added complexities throughout most of the protocol description. <p> Most intra-domain or intra-campus links will probably be configured as default dense-mode. 15 For this reason we have also developed a dense mode multicast scheme that uses DVMRP-like RPF, but that is unicast routing pro tocol independent <ref> [13] </ref> The primary issue in splicing dense mode regions onto a distribution tree comprised, in whole or part, of sparse mode regions, is the incompatability between the data driven nature of dense mode, and the explicit join nature of sparse mode.

Reference-contexts: We do not want to delete such entries if (*,G) entry exists; otherwise, data packets will travel down both RP tree and SPT. It may not result in periodic duplicates (because of the RPF check), but it does waste a lot of network bandwidth. 14 see <ref> [14] </ref>, this address (224.0.0.2) is also used by routers to send PIM query packets to neighbor routers on the same LAN Unreachable RPs are detected using the RP reachabil-ity message. When a (*,G) entry is established by a router with local members, a timer is set.

Reference-contexts: If the path to reach the RP or some source is indicated as being the appropriate QOS and indicated as being symmetric then PIM-speaking routers can determine that if they forward joins upstream that the data packets will allowed to travel downstream. This implies that BGP/IDRP <ref> [15, 16] </ref> should carry two QOS flags: symmetry flag and multicast willing flag.

Reference-contexts: This implies that BGP/IDRP [15, 16] should carry two QOS flags: symmetry flag and multicast willing flag. If the generic route computed by hop-by-hop routing does not have the symmetry and multicast bits set, but there is an SDRP <ref> [17] </ref> route that does, then the PIM message should be sent with an embedded SDRP route. This option needs to be added to PIM join messages. Its absence will indicate forwarding accord-ing to the router's unicast routing table. Its presence will indicate forwarding according to the SDRP route.

Reference-contexts: that SDRP should also carry symmetry and multicast QOS bits and that PIM should carry an optional SDRP route inside of it to cause the PIM message and the multicast forwarding state to occur on an alternative distribution tree branch. * Interaction with receiver initiated reservation setup such as RSVP <ref> [18] </ref>: Once the shortest path distribution tree has been established RSVP reservation messages follow the reverse of senders path messages and the senders path messages will travel according to the state that PIM installs.
