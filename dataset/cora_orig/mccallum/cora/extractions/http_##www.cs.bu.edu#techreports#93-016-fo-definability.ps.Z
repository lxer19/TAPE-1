Abstract: We give a variable-free relational calculus which defines exactly all first-order definable relations in a arbitrary structure. We then show that, over an arbitrary class C of finite ordered structures with signature f&lt;&lt;&lt;; R 1 ; : : : ; R ff g, the unary relations uniformly defined by this calculus over C are characterized by a another simplified variable-free calculus which we call Q. Q is the least set of formal expressions such that:

Reference-contexts: The formulae under consideration are called "arrangements", generalizing formulae by the same name in <ref> [1] </ref>, and we use the letter to denote them. <p> In such a case it is also clear that d is also the degree of , and we can say that is simple of degree d. (The "arrangements" in <ref> [1] </ref> are, in our sense, "simple arrangements of degree 0".) A special subset of all n-arrangements of degree d is the subset of all simple n-arrangements of degree d, denoted M n;d .

Reference-contexts: Our conventions for FO formulae are standard, except for two (see for example <ref> [3] </ref>). First, it is customary to write '(x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) whenever one needs to mention that the free variables of the formula ' are among x 1 ; : : : ; x n .
