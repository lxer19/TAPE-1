Abstract: The World Wide Web (WWW) server at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is one of the most heavily accessed WWW servers in the world. To increase our understanding of how users access this server and to provide a basis for assessing server and system software optimizations, we analyzed NCSA's server performance using the Avatar virtual reality performance visualization system. The large volume of performance data generated each day, coupled with rapidly changing server access patterns, makes real-time analysis both attractive and highly desirable. This paper presents the results of our analysis and discusses the implications for understanding time varying data in a virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: in a manner similar to keyboard shortcuts in a desktop application and can be used even when the menu interfaces of x3.3.1 are hidden. 3.4 Avatar Data Inputs To maximize portability and extensibility, Avatar has been designed to process high-dimensional data described by the Pablo Self Defining Data Format (SDDF) <ref> [1] </ref>. This data can originate from a file or can be real-time data transmitted via a network socket. <p> Below, we describe SDDF, illustrate its representation of WWW data, and describe mechanisms for real-time WWW data reduction and control. 3.4.1 Self Defining Data Format (SDDF) Avatar uses the Pablo flfl Self Defining Data Format (SDDF) <ref> [1] </ref> for its data representation. SDDF is a meta-data format, in the style of HDF [13] or netCDF. As such, SDDF consists of two parts: data record descriptors and data record instances defined by those descriptors.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The ease of use of the World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [2] </ref> as a global information system has made it an indispensable tool for the worldwide Internet community. The widespread distribution of WWW servers and client browsers (e.g., NCSA Mosaic) not only fueled the explosion of interest in the WWW but also led to phenomenal growth in network traffic.

Reference-contexts: Our work differs in its generalization of scatterplot matrices to encompass three-dimensional scatterplots and the integration of history lines to show phase behavior. The closest analog to our work within the virtual reality community is Feiner and Besher's work on multi-dimensional data spaces for visualization of financial data. AutoVision <ref> [3] </ref> and it's predecessor, n-Vision [6], use "worlds within worlds" to display N -dimensional data. Both create a hierarchy of three-dimensional displays, where within a display one can recursively nest other displays by selecting a point. Our work differs by imposing no hierarchy on the data dimensions.

Reference-contexts: In short, the conundrum of high-dimensional data visualization is finding presentation metaphors that successfully project the data in meaningful ways. Avatar draws on a long history of data display research in the statistical graphics community <ref> [4] </ref> by extending the notion of a two-dimensional scatterplot matrix to three dimensions. In a two-dimensional scatterplot matrix, all possible pairs of dimensions for a set of n-dimensional data are plotted against each other in separate scatterplots arranged in an n by n matrix. <p> First, the matrix is symmetric; the upper and lower triangles are simple transpositions. This allows one to view whichever projection is more convenient. Second, the diagonal is degenerate | both metrics are the same for these scatterplots. In Figure 2, these degenerate scatterplots have been replaced with plots <ref> [4] </ref> showing the mean and variance of the associated metric. However, if the data were plotted in the diagonal scatterplots, its dispersion would be visible on the diagonal. Third, data clustered in one scatterplot need not be clustered in other scatterplots. <p> These history ribbons serve two roles. First, they are markers of data paths, much as massless particles and stream lines show air movement in visualizations of computational fluid dynamic calculations. Second, they fulfill the same role as brushing in statistical graphics <ref> [4] </ref> | interactively enabling history ribbons for a subset of the data points allows one to see if the selected points cluster in one or more scattercubes. In our implementation of history ribbons, more recent positions are rendered using bright colors; darker colors show older positions. <p> Cleveland <ref> [4] </ref> is a cogent summary of the statistics community's techniques for visualizing irregular data, Huber [7] describes early experiences with three-dimensional scatterplots. Our work differs in its generalization of scatterplot matrices to encompass three-dimensional scatterplots and the integration of history lines to show phase behavior.

Reference-contexts: After computing the statistics, the analysis program produces data records in the Pablo Self Defining Data Format (SDDF); SDDF is described in greater detail in x3.4.1. The SDDF records are then transferred to the Avatar visualization module for rendering in the NCSA CAVE <ref> [5] </ref>, an unencumbered environment for immersive data analysis. <p> a subset of the points are clustered, with one outlier clearly visible. 3.2 Avatar Implementation To realize the Avatar scattercube metaphor just described, we have developed a virtual world implementation that operates with either (a) a head mounted display (HMD) and six degree of freedom tracker, (b) the CAVE k <ref> [5] </ref> virtual reality theater, or (c) a workstation display with stereo glasses. Sonification software supports real-time mapping of data to sound using either the Porsonify [11] sonification library or the CAVE's native sound library. The HMD version supports three dimensional sound spatialization via a Crystal Rivers Technologies Convolvotron [18, 17].

Reference-contexts: To cope with this ever growing dimensionality, one needs more powerful statistical data analysis techniques that can identify data correlations prior to data display. Projection pursuit <ref> [8] </ref> is one such powerful technique. It can be viewed as a generalization of principal components analysis that finds one or more optimum projections of the data variables such that the data exhibits clusters with respect to those dimensions.

Reference-contexts: The WWW servers at NCSA have experienced tremendous traffic growth, with the request rate growing at a compounded rate of about eleven percent per month for many months <ref> [10] </ref>. To support continued growth, next generation WWW servers must be capable of concurrently serving multiple request streams while managing a potentially multi-gigabyte data base of multimedia information. This places demands on the servers' underlying operating system and file system that lie far outside today's normal operating regime. <p> Below, we describe the qualitative results obtained by analyzing WWW performance data in the Avatar virtual environment. We also summarize our experiences with Avatar and real-time data. For a more extensive analysis of WWW traffic based on Avatar and other statistical techniques, see <ref> [10] </ref>. 4.1 WWW Data Analysis Although we had earlier conducted a statistical analysis of the WWW server logs, while being immersed in Avatar's scattercube representation of the WWW data, we quickly discovered several data correlations that deepened our understanding of the WWW client stimuli and WWW server responses.

Reference-contexts: Although the majority of projection pursuit techniques are intended for two-dimensional projection, there are techniques for three-dimensional projection pursuit <ref> [12] </ref>. In principle, such techniques are ideally matched to the scattercube metaphor. By collapsing 40-100 dimensions to only three, all the data can be shown in a single scattercube. However, each of the resulting three dimensions is now a linear combination of all the original dimensions.

As such, SDDF consists of two parts: data record descriptors and data record instances defined by those descriptors. The record descriptors define the number and sizes of the data elements in each record. The actual data consists of a sequence of descriptor tags and record instances.

Reference-contexts: Understanding the correlations among these metrics, and their evolution with changing access patterns, is a daunting task. To alleviate this problem, we have exploited and extended the Pablo performance analysis toolkit <ref> [14] </ref> to develop Avatar [15] | a flexible, extensible framework for using virtual reality to analyze complex performance data. Avatar uses data immersion to provide a fast, intuitive mechanism for evaluating data from a variety of perspectives and for manipulating characteristics of the data display. <p> For the WWW data of x2, each pair represents a different data dimension. A corresponding SDDF record is shown in Figure 4. There is a one-one mapping between fields in the header and fields in the record. The Pablo <ref> [14] </ref> software contains a variety of tools for generating and processing ASCII and binary SDDF files, and it supports transmission of records over standard Unix sockets. <p> We are instrumenting the NCSA HTTP server using the Pablo performance instrumentation toolkit <ref> [14] </ref> to capture timestamped event traces of file and network input/output operations, sizes, durations, and times and to generate statistical summaries of data in user-specified windows of time.

Below, we briefly summarize those aspects most relevant to user interaction and data analysis; for additional implementation details, see <ref> [15] </ref>. 3.3 Immersive Interaction One of the more difficult implementation problems in virtual reality is user interaction. Capitalizing on new hardware technology and the kinematic and haptic senses requires a judicious balance of new and familiar interaction techniques.

Reference-contexts: As of May 1995, NCSA has eleven HP 735's dedicated as WWW servers. In the NCSA configuration, the local disk on each HP 735 stores performance data and log files. The WWW servers are connected to Andrew (AFS flR ) y <ref> [16] </ref> file servers via a 100 megabit/second Fiber Distribution Data Interface (FDDI) ring; see Figure 1. The FDDI ring connects to the rest of NCSA and, via a T3 link, to the Internet.
