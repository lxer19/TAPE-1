Abstract: The paper presents way of explaining knowledge induction process to help students to understand it, and experiment by means of computer program. The knowledge is induced from examples of some situation with a sort of generalization that use entropy measure to guide the generalization process. Set of examples can be changed to enable analysis of influence of new examples to the induced knowledge. Simple addition of a new example that describe the same situation, possibly leads to modification of the induced knowledge. The process is illustrated with the simple algorithm implemented in Logo. Furthermore, the algorithm is explained in details to enable simple modification and use with some other input examples. The induction algorithm implemented in Logo is one of the well known machine learning algorithms. It has been developed in a few ways to some poverful algorithms that have been successfully applied on a lot of real-world problems, to induce knowledge about some real situation. One of widely known real-world application is in medical diagnosis where machine learning system is used to predict a patient diagnosis from the symptoms.

Reference-contexts: The entropy and informativity of attribute outlook are then calculated: Entropy (outlook) = 5 fl 0:971 + 14 5 fl 0:971 = 0:694 Inf ormativity (Attribute) = 0:940 Entropy (outlook) = 0:246 4 Description of the Logo implementation Program is written in LogoS ( <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]), but can be easily adapted for any other Logo interpreter. It implements described knowledge induction algorithm and consist of three main parts; the first reading domain (description of attributes and classes, and examples), the second generating decision tree and the third writing decision tree to screen.

Reference-contexts: To each example, a value called class is assigned (e.g. prediction of the next-day weather). The problem is to induce knowledge describing value of the class by means of the attribute values. To illustrate the way of knowledge induction with computer, one of the basic machine learning algorithms ID3 <ref> [3] </ref> has been implemented in Logo. The algorithm belongs to the family of machine learning algorithms called Top Down Induction of Decision Trees. The main characteristic of these algorithms is that knowledge induction is performed using top-down approach and is represented by means of decision tree. <p> To describe learning from examples as performed by ID3 algorithm a simple `Saturday morning' <ref> [3] </ref> domain is used. In this machine learning domain, 14 training examples are given (see Table 1). <p> Outlook is rain and windy is no leads to the most right leaf labelled with class yes. In this situation it is obvious that temperature andhumidity are not important. 3 Algorithm used for knowledge induction Machine learning algorithm ID3 <ref> [3] </ref> induces knowledge from examples and presents it in the form of decision tree. Decision tree consists of nodes, each containing test of an attribute value, and leaves labelled with the class value. Illustrated on the tree from one for each value of the attribute.
