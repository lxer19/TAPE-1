Abstract: The question we address is why are there no `killer applications' ? We note that in the AI ontology community, there is a dearth of well-developed applications reported in the literature. One possible explanation is that the research community has perhaps been more focussed on the creation of tools and methodologies for building ontologies, and the building of particular ontologies, than on putting them to use in applications. That ontologies will ultimately deliver value thus remains largely a matter of faith. Could it also be that there are inherent technical barriers? If so, what are they and under what conditions can these barriers be avoided? What has been done in related fields? To shed light on these issues, we propose a structure for examining and clarifying the current state of the art of ontology application which should, in turn, facilitate faster development of the field. Specifically, we introduce a scheme for classifying ontology applications along a number of dimensions (e.g. purpose, representation of meaning, techniques used and scale) and advocate that such a scheme be used when research results are reported. Our hope is that this will facilitate faster growth in the field leading to fully deployed `killer applications' in the forseeable future.

Reference-contexts: We discovered that full-fledged semantic translation is not a solved problem. So the dream of using an ontology as an interchange format to achieve inter-operability as outlined in <ref> [1] </ref>, turns out to be very difficult to achieve. Generalizing this, and based on experience in other projects, the whole idea of using an ontology as an interchange format to achieving savings by only having to build O (n) translators instead of O (n**2) needs to be closely examined.

Reference-contexts: It turn out that, from a hard-nosed practical standpoint, one has a difficult time making a case for savings using this argument. Let us see why. For a start, we don't even know how to build automatic translators between semantically rich representations <ref> [2] </ref>. But lets ignore that for the moment, and do a bit of cost-benefit analysis. If n is 2, then it is actually more work to build the ontology and two translators, than just two point to point (two-way) translators.

Reference-contexts: For example, let us consider the Enterprise Ontology and Tool Set (full details may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>): Purpose: to achieve inter-operability of heterogeneous software applications (e.g. databases, simulation tools, process modelers) in an enterprise modeling environment. Representation Languages and Paradigms: A structured informal representation exists in natural language, and a formal encoding is in Ontolingua. Meaning and Formality: Natural Language version: carefully crafted definitions.

Reference-contexts: To provide a framework for presenting such information, we give a preliminary description of a multidimensional space in which we may classify ontology applications. Some key dimensions for this space are given below. In part these have been taken from <ref> [4] </ref> which contains further details. Purpose: the purpose of the ontology, e.g inter-operability, reuse, reduce software maintenance costs.
