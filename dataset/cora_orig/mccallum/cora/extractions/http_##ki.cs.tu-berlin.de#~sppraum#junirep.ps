Reference-contexts: Centroids, borders, aligned/non-aligned enclosing rectangles could be used to determine those relations. Mappings between qualitative domains and appropriate numeric intervals need to be constructed for each spatial aspect. This is a quite involved task as can be seen for example for distances in <ref> [CDFH97] </ref>. 12 Chapter 4 Qualitative Representation of Motion Information Wilfried Brauer, Andreas Eisenkolb, Daniel Hernandez, Alexandra Musto, Kerstin Schill 4.1 Introduction The classification and prediction of complex courses of motion require the availability of an adequate representational structure and a processing stage able to analyze the represented spatio-temporal patterns.

Reference-contexts: The need for such a clarification became evident during the discussion at the "Themenkolloquium: Qualitative und metrische Verfahren zur raumlichen Inferenz und Be-wegungsanalyse" in Berlin, 26.-27.06.1997. I ended up doing a lot of cut and paste from my dissertation <ref> [Her94] </ref>, but have also added some new material on the differences between qualitative and quantitative constraint systems (that part, however, might turn out to be redundant and/or better merged with what Bernhard Nebel writes).

The domain of the latter group is mainly the universe of phenomena which low-level-models (detectors, correlators, energy models) cannot account for.

Reference-contexts: If definite knowledge about the exact base relation is not available, it is possible to express indefinite knowledge by specifying unions of base relations.

Reference-contexts: It is intended as a terminological framework for theoretical modelling and reasoning, empirical investigations (e.g. about navigation performance and conjectured mental representations in animals or humans), and robot applications alike. The classification (cf. <ref> [KBR97, WKBM + 97] </ref>) leads to a fine-grain distinction of atomic navigational behaviors; it should be emphasized that any actual agent is likely to use a combination in order to increase robustness. 5 2.2 Basic Behavior and Elementary Navigation Tactics At the level of basic behaviors and elementary navigation tactics, two <p> The wheelchair can drive along a route concatenating different basic behaviors.

Reference-contexts: To fulfill this aim, we first present a tentative hierarchy of navigation behavior associated with a hierarchy of different representational granularities of spatial knowledge (see also <ref> [KL88] </ref> and section 2): * Following already known routes to a fixed target area: local reference systems associated with specific behavioral programs * Recognizing places: constellations of landmarks * Recognizing routes: context information (sequences of landmarks, tempo ral sequences or feedback about self-movement) * Solving the "aliasing" problem, that is recognizing

Reference-contexts: Tactics under consideration include synthetic techniques as well as tactics modelled after nature, in the spirit of the taxonomy above. An example 7 of a synthetic tactic for navigation in enclosed space is the PartiGame algo-rithm, where the space is repeatedly subdivided into passable and impassable areas <ref> [KLB + 97] </ref>. Image-based homing [Rof95a, Rof95b, Rof97a] is an example of a tactic modelled after nature, i.e. honeybees and desert ants. These tactics have been tested in a simulation [SHR94] and on the wheelchair.

Reference-contexts: These values are checked against the metric constraints available and pruned accordingly. Metric constraints can be represented by sets of intervals (as in the case of a linear domain such as time, <ref> [Mei91] </ref>) or sets of Cartesian products of intervals (for example, distance and angle in a polar coordinate representation of positions). Qualitative constraints are usually expressed as disjunctions of relations (or of relation-tuples). The "values" or positions of the objects often remain implicit. <p> This is equivalent to placing them on arbitrary but consistent places on the screen/paper or the real world. Obviously, some quantitative constraints imply qualitative constraints and vice versa. This relation, however, is not as straightforward as for the temporal domain <ref> [Mei91] </ref>. Rather, the whole spectrum of spatial aspects studied in QSR comes here into play. The relations between object positions could be described by any combination of topological, order, distance, orientation, etc. relations. Centroids, borders, aligned/non-aligned enclosing rectangles could be used to determine those relations.

Reference-contexts: A relation between two objects A and B is described by a transformation matrix with constraints on its variables. The transformation matrix consists of a distance vector and a rotation matrix R. <ref> [MM95] </ref> describes the use of transformation matrices in a qualitative context. Spatial inference in a context with coordinate systems may be used (as usual in roboter kinematics) to describe movements of bodies with inherent coordinate systems.

Reference-contexts: We have been using the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) by Randell et al <ref> [RCC92] </ref> to represent binary topological relations between regions, where regions are regular subsets of topological space. In this calculus, regions do not have to be internally connected, i.e., a region might consist of several disconnected parts, and the topological space does not have a particular dimension.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, we use a different canonical model for the RCC-8 relations, where a region can be represented by a set of characteristic points and information about the neighbourhood of these points <ref> [Ren97] </ref>. This model results from the encoding of RCC-8 in modal logic. The encoding is obtained by introducing a modal interior operator and transforming the topological properties of the relations to modal logic using this operator. <p> Using the RCC-8 model we were able to proof that whenever a set of RCC-8 formulas is consistent, there is a model in any dimension, i.e., even in one-dimensional space <ref> [Ren97] </ref>. This is only true when regions do not have to be connected, which is not required in RCC-8 anyway. Deciding consistency of a set of RCC-8 relations is NP-complete, i.e., ev ery sound and complete algorithm is expected to take time exponential in the 30 number of regions [RN97]. <p> Summarizing, the research on representing topological aspects of cognitive maps and reasoning with this knowledge so far has led to a deeper understanding of the cognitive aspects of this kind of representation [KRR97], its computational properties [RN97], and its representational properties <ref> [Ren97] </ref>. 31

Deciding consistency of a set of RCC-8 relations is NP-complete, i.e., ev ery sound and complete algorithm is expected to take time exponential in the 30 number of regions <ref> [RN97] </ref>. By transforming RCC-8 models to propositional satisfiability, some relations are transformed to Horn formulas. <p> Furthermore path-consistency is sufficient for deciding consistency of b H 8 relations <ref> [RN97] </ref>. This set can also be used to increase efficiency of backtracking algorithms for the general consistency problem in RCC-8 by reducing the average branching factor from 4.0 to 1.4375. One future direction of research will be extending the basic representation formalism, e.g., integrating orientation. <p> Summarizing, the research on representing topological aspects of cognitive maps and reasoning with this knowledge so far has led to a deeper understanding of the cognitive aspects of this kind of representation [KRR97], its computational properties <ref> [RN97] </ref>, and its representational properties [Ren97]. 31

Reference-contexts: Image-based homing [Rof95a, Rof95b, Rof97a] is an example of a tactic modelled after nature, i.e. honeybees and desert ants. These tactics have been tested in a simulation <ref> [SHR94] </ref> and on the wheelchair. Several basic behaviors, e.g. wall-following and turning-into-a-door, enable the wheelchair to move in corridors and to enter and exit rooms, resp. The basic behaviors are fairly robust against changes in the environment because they hardly make assumptions about the surroundings.

Reference-contexts: Some describe what would correspond to a large range of quantitative values of the same quality, while others may single out a unique distinctive value (cf. <ref> [Sim86] </ref>). * While the discriminating power of single qualitative relations is kept intentionally low, the interaction of several relations can lead to arbitrarily fine distinctions. If each relation is considered to represent a set of possible values, the intersections of those sets correspond to elements that satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: The MEMOSPACE project investigates the three phases of mental model-based reasoning using a novel type of material, namely n-term series tasks constructed with the system of Allen's interval relations (for a survey see <ref> [SKK + 97] </ref>). An important methodological advantage of the material is due to the fact that model-consistent solutions can be identified among the correct solutions.

Reference-contexts: We only consider the spatial relations given in the text. These are represented as arcs in a directed graph. The nodes of the graph are the objects in the text. Our approach is metric, that is we assume the three dimensional Euclidean space (see <ref> [WSH97] </ref>). Since we don't get explicit metric information in the texts, we restrict our objects to be symmetric with a canonical coordinate system at their center. The size of an object is given by symbolic parameters height and radius for cylinders and height, width, and depth for quaders.
