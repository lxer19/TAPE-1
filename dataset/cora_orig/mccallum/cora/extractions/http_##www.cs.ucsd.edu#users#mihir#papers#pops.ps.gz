Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This short article was written to complement my invited talk at the ISW 97 conference <ref> [3] </ref>. 1 I would like to try to introduce you to a certain, relatively new, sub-area of cryptography that we have been calling practice-oriented provable-security. It is about applying the ideas of "provably security" to the derivation of practical, secure protocols.

Specifically, the suggestion of <ref> [7] </ref>, followed in the other works, was to model a block cipher as a finite pseudorandom function (FPRF) family. (The fundamental notion of a pseudorandom function family is due to Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali [17]. The finite variant was introduced in [7].)

Roughly, we are assuming that as long as you don't know the underlying key, the input-output behavior of a block cipher closely resembles that of a random function. Thus, the theorems in the mentioned papers say that a scheme (eg. <p> And it brings a new dimension to protocols: rather than just being secure or non-secure, one can be "more" secure than another. For example, the theorem of <ref> [7] </ref> characterizing the security of the CBC MAC says that an adversary who runs for time t and sees q correctly MACed messages has chance at most * + (3q 2 n 2 + 1)=2 l of correctly forging the MAC of a new message, where l is the block length <p> If the reduction is strong, shorter keys will suffice and the protocol is more efficient. Reduction quality plays a significant role in <ref> [7, 6, 10, 12, 4, 5] </ref> all of which achieve tight or close to tight reductions. We found that improving the concrete security was a rich and rewarding line of work, and thinking about it greatly increases understanding of the problem. <p> Attacks measure the degree of insecurity; our quantitative bounds measure the degree of security. When the two meet, we have completely characterized the security of the protocol. For example, the security of the CBC MAC shown in <ref> [7] </ref> is the flip-side of attacks like those of Preneel and Van Oorschot [26]. (The latter say that the CBC MAC can be broken once 2 l=2 messages have been MACed, where l is the block length of the underlying cipher. <p> We say, roughly, that it can't be broken when fewer than this many messages are MACed.) Thus the results of <ref> [7, 26] </ref> complement each other very well. Yet, the literature on these subjects does not reflect this duality appropriately. We found that even when proofs are provided, much is to be gained by finding the best possible attacks.

It achieves provable security by providing a model, definitions, protocols, and proofs of correctness for these protocols under standard assumptions.

In <ref> [11] </ref> we provide provably secure protocols for the three party session key distribution problem. All our protocols are efficient and practical, viable alternatives to current systems. Some have been implemented.

Reference-contexts: Complexity-based cryptography has been remarkably successful, coming up with definitions for many central cryptographic primitives, and constructions based on "minimal assumptions." For a brief introduction to this body of work, refer to the recent survey by Goldreich <ref> [16] </ref>. In practice? The potential for the idea of provable security to impact practice is large. Yet its 3 actual impact had been disappointingly small, in the sense that these ideas were reflected almost not at all in protocols used in practice. Here are some possible reasons.

With concrete security definitions in hand, we will turn to analyzing popular encryption modes like CBC or CTR and gauge their merits.

Reference-contexts: This explains why the random oracle model is viewed in [9] as a "bridge between theory and practice."

Reference-contexts: When the two meet, we have completely characterized the security of the protocol. For example, the security of the CBC MAC shown in [7] is the flip-side of attacks like those of Preneel and Van Oorschot <ref> [26] </ref>. (The latter say that the CBC MAC can be broken once 2 l=2 messages have been MACed, where l is the block length of the underlying cipher. <p> We say, roughly, that it can't be broken when fewer than this many messages are MACed.) Thus the results of <ref> [7, 26] </ref> complement each other very well. Yet, the literature on these subjects does not reflect this duality appropriately. We found that even when proofs are provided, much is to be gained by finding the best possible attacks.

Reference-contexts: In [11] we provide provably secure protocols for the three party session key distribution problem. All our protocols are efficient and practical, viable alternatives to current systems. Some have been implemented. Our models have been used to study related key distribution problems, for example in <ref> [27] </ref>. 4 Symmetric encryption The above has discussed provable security and its practice oriented variant in a general way.

Reference-contexts: They developed it in the particular context of asymmetric encryption, but it soon spread to be applied to other tasks. (Of these, the most basic were pseudorandomness <ref> [14, 28, 17] </ref> and digital signatures [19]). What is provable security? The paradigm is as follows. Take some goal, like achieving privacy via encryption. The first step is to make a formal adversarial model and define what it means for an encryption scheme to be secure.
