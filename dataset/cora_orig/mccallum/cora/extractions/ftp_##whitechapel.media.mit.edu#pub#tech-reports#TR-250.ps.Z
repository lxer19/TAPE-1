Title: The Chirplet Transform: Physical Considerations of wavelets, related to each other by two-dimensional affine coordinate

Abstract: We consider a multidimensional parameter space formed by inner products of a parameterizable family of chirp functions with a signal under analysis. We propose the use of quadratic chirp functions (which we will call q-chirps for short), giving rise to a parameter space that includes both the time-frequency plane and the time-scale plane as two-dimensional subspaces. The parameter space contains a "time-frequency-scale volume", and thus encompasses both the short-time Fourier transform (as a slice along the time and frequency axes), and the wavelet transform (as a slice along the time and scale axes). In addition to time, frequency, and scale, there are two other coordinate axes within this transform space: shear-in-time (obtained through convolution with a q-chirp) and shear-in-frequency (obtained through multiplication by a q-chirp). Signals in this multidimensional space can be obtained by a new transform which we call the "q-chirplet transform", or simply the "chiplet transform".

Reference-contexts: The continuous wavelet transform is formed by taking inner products of the signal with the uncount 1 When using a multidimensional parameter space, it is often impossible to establish frame bounds <ref> [1] </ref> on the energy in the parameter space. With only one parameter, we cannot always reconstruct the signal. With two effective parameters, we can reconstruct the signal, and also bound the energy of the representation. With three or more parameters, the energy in the transform space will be infinite. <p> Although Gabor's development was not completely rigorous (and, in fact his representation was later shown to be unstable <ref> [1] </ref>), his notion of a time-frequency tiling was a very significant contribution. Gabor referred to the ele ments of his tiling as logons. Beginning around 1956, Siebert began to formulate a radar detection philosophy with some particularly useful insights in terms of time-frequency [8][9].

Reference-contexts: "time-frequency-scale chirprate 2 " (TFSC) parameter space. 2 Traditionally, the term chirp-rate (with a hyphen) is used, but in this paper, we use the single word "chirprate", to avoid confusion arising out of hyphens in compounded parameter lists. 1.1 Historical Notes In 1946, in his seminal paper on communication theory <ref> [7] </ref>, Gabor (who later won the Nobel prize for his work on holography), provided a new interpretation of the one-dimensional Gaussian-windowed STFT and examined the time-frequency plane in terms of a two-dimensional tiling. <p> method in this way, we can generalize it further by replacing the one-parameter operator, C 0;f c ;0;0;0 , with multi-parameter operators. 2.6.2 True rectangular tiling of the TF plane While many researchers depict certain tilings of the TF plane (such as given by the STFT), schematically, using rectangular grids <ref> [7] </ref>, and even refer to them as rectangular tilings, it is important to note that the actual shape of the individual tiles is better described as a tesselation of overlapping "blobs", perhaps Gaussian, as was the case with the Gaussian-windowed STFT. 7 The term "rectangular" is used here in the context
