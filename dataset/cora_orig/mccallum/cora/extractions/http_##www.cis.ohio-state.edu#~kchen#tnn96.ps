Abstract: A modified hierarchical mixtures of experts (HME) architecture is presented for text-dependent speaker identification. A new gating network is introduced to the original HME architecture for the use of instantaneous and transitional spectral information in text-dependent speaker identification. The statistical model underlying the proposed architecture is presented and learning is treated as a maximum likelihood problem; in particular, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is also proposed for adjusting the parameters of the proposed architecture. An evaluation has been carried out using a database of isolated digit utterances by 10 male talkers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the original HME architecture in text-dependent speaker identification.

Reference-contexts: Tests using utterances recorded in the second and the third session are called TEST-2 and TEST-3, respectively. Accordingly, these experimental results are respectively shown in TABLE II and TABLE III. For the purpose of comparison, we also list results of the MLP, the original HME <ref> [9] </ref> and time-delay HMEs [11]. According to results in TABLE II and TABLE III, it is evident that the system using the modified HME outperforms ones using the MLP, the original HME and time-delay HMEs.
