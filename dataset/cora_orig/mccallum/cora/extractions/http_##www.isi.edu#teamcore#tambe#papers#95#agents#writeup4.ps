The contour temporal reasoning, and natural language lines indicate that the two helicopters are on a hill, just communication.

The IPs unmask their helicopters by popping Important applications of this agent technology can be out from behind the ridge to launch missiles at the enemy found in areas such as education [14], vehicles, and quickly remask (hide) by dipping behind manufacturing [11], entertainment [2, 12] and the ridge to survive retaliatory attacks.

To begin our effort, we have focused on building about the active goal hierarchies of the IPs controlling intelligent pilot agents to control simulated military the helicopters.
