Title: Multirate Broadcast Switching Networks Nonblocking in a Wide Sense  
Author: Dongsoo S. Kim and Ding-Zhu Du 
Note: DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science  
Abstract: This paper describes wide-sense nonblocking Clos switching networks for multirate broadcast communications, where a compatible connection request can be routed through the networks without disturbing the existing network configuration if all requests are conforming to a given routing algorithm. The routing algorithm partitions middle stage switches into three subsets and routes connection requests by utilizing different subsets of middles according to their normalized weights. The result shows (2:875n 1) min(k + r 1=k ) + 2 middle switches for C(n; r; m) are sufficient for any multirate broadcast requests, whereas strictly nonblocking multirate Clos networks require an unbounded number of middle stage switches when the range of weights become broadly distributed.

Reference-contexts: A network is said to be nonblocking in a wide-sense if a new request can be satisfied without interfering the existing network configuration under condition that all requests comply to a given routing algorithm. Benes <ref> [1] </ref> proved a Clos network C (n; 2; m) is wide-sense nonblocking in circuit switching if m = b3n=2c.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Since a multistage Clos network <ref> [3] </ref> was introduced, it has been heavily used for telephone switching systems in place of crossbar switches because of its asymptotic advantage over the crossbars while providing nonblocking behavior between any pair of idle external ports. <p> It is well-known that a symmetric MULTIRATE BROADCAST SWITCHING NETWORKS NONBLOCKING IN A WIDE SENSE 3 Clos network, C (n; r; 2n 1), is strictly nonblocking in circuit switching one-to-one communications <ref> [3] </ref>. Melen and Turner [8] found a sufficient condition of a nonblocking Clos network for multirate one-to-one communications. They took an advantage of higher speed of internal links over externals to reduce hardware requirements.

Reference-contexts: All connections with weights more than 1=2 are routed through only one of subnetworks, and all requests with weights no more than 1=2 are routed through the other subnetwork. Gao and Hwang <ref> [4] </ref> constructed a wide-sense nonblocking Clos network for multirate traffics with 5:75n middle switches by exploiting a quota routing scheme. <p> It allows broadcast requests of weight greater than 1=2 to use the first subset of middles and other requests to use the second subset. In the following section, we will further reduce the number of middle switches by employing a technique proposed by Gao and Hwang <ref> [4] </ref>. 5. Wide-sense Nonblocking Multirate Broadcast Networks In this section, we inadvertently ignore the integer operations and the bound of k not to stray from the main focus. <p> To provide a general multirate broadcast switching networks, we extend a routing algorithm called a quota scheme from Gao and Hwang <ref> [4] </ref>. Connection requests are partitioned into large calls (C L ) and small calls (C S ) by their weight.

Reference-contexts: Gao and Hwang [4] constructed a wide-sense nonblocking Clos network for multirate traffics with 5:75n middle switches by exploiting a quota routing scheme. Hwang <ref> [5] </ref> had given conditions m = O (nr) of rearrangeable multi-connection 3-stage Clos networks, which is a generalization of interconnection networks such that a set of input ports are able to connect to a set of output ports.

Reference-contexts: Masson and Jordan [7] proved that an asymmetric Clos network was strictly nonblocking for broadcast if m r 2 n 1 + n 2 1, which fell into m = O (nr) for a symmetric one. Hwang <ref> [6] </ref> provided two routing strategies for broadcast. One is to use only one middle switch for a broadcast request and all messages are duplicated only in a middle switch.

Reference-contexts: His work was based on lack of fan-out capability in middle stage switches so that all duplications must be done in input switches and output switches but not in the middle stage.

Reference-contexts: The first study that allows any switches to duplicate messages to relieve the severe complexity was carried out by Yang and Masson <ref> [11] </ref>. They showed that a Clos network in circuit switching is nonblocking for broadcast requests when m &gt; min (n1)(k+r 1=k ) = O (n ln r=ln ln r), where 1 k min (n 1; r). <p> In that reason, (12) is corresponding to Yang and Masson's result <ref> [11] </ref>. From (6) and (12), we conclude that a Clos network, C (n; r; m), is nonblocking in a wide-sense for multirate broadcast if m (3n 2) min 1kmin (2n1;r) (k + r 1=k ) + 2 The routing algorithm divides the middle switches into two subsets. <p> Let us define f (r) = min (k + r 1=k ) which was known to have an approximate minimum of O (ln r= ln ln r) <ref> [11] </ref>. The previous wide-sense nonblocking broadcast Clos network can be represented as m (3n 2)f (r) + 2 We will consider another special network in which the weight of a new broadcast request is no more than 1 p+1 for some positive p.
