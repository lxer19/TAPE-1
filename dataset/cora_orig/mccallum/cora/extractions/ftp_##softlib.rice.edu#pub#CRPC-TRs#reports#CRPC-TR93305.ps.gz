Abstract: A family of numerical schemes, based on finite difference operators is introduced for the computation of elastic waves. We use a displacement-stress formulation of the model. After deriving some stability results, we give an analysis of the computational cost. Imposing an accuracy criterion on the phase velocity, we derive the numerical parameters. We also show that an optimum order of approximation exists for a given precision.

Our goal in this paper is to see what could be gained, if anything, by using arbitrary accuracy in space in the finite difference scheme. <p> s t 2 L X jfi l j (3.5) For a scheme of order 4 in space, that is with L = 2, we have in homogeneous media the following stability condition : s t 0:60 (3.6) A fourth order accurate sheme was derived differently by Bayliss et al (cf <ref> [4] </ref>). In homogeneous medium they obtained s t 0:67 (3.7) A priori the second scheme is the most appealing since it allows bigger time steps. But as we shall see the CFL number is a limit, and dispersion control implies to choose C:t=h much lower than the CFL number. <p> The maximum gain for the computational cost is when we change from a (2,2) scheme to a (2,4) scheme. This justifies the endeavor for (2,4) schemes for the elastic wave equation (cf <ref> [4] </ref>, [5]). It also proves that higher order schemes would not greatly improve the cost.
