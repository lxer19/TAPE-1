Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of a psychoacous-tical preprocessing model for measuring the speech quality of low-bit-rate codecs. The method for deriving an objective measure of the sound quality is to transform the input and output signal of a speech coding device into a so-called internal representation of the sound. Differences between the internal representations of input and output signal, calculated as the correlation coefficient between them, correspond to a decreased quality of the output signal. The preprocessing model consists of a critical-band filterbank which simulates the filtering by the basilar membrane, followed by a nonlinear adaptation circuit modeling amplitude compression and temporal masking effects, and a further filtering stage which analyzes fluctuations of the temporal envelope of the sound signal. This signal processing seems to be a successful universal model to simulate a variety of psychoacoustical data as well as the perception of speech sound at the same time.

At the same time, a successful speech quality measure gives important new insights into the mechanisms of speech perception under (partly) adverse conditions and can answer the question, which features of a speech signal are perceptually relevant.

Reference-contexts: In our work group an elaborated functional model for the signal preprocessing has been developed which originated from a former group at University of Gottingen. This model has been successfully applied to conditions of simultaneous and non-simultaneous masking in a wide variety of psychoacoustic experiments <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. The signals applied in these experiments consist of well-defined components like sinusoidals, harmonic tone complexes and (filtered) noise. The question arises, if the model for the detection and discrimination of these signals is sufficient to model the much more complex problem of (specific) tasks of speech perception.

Reference-contexts: For high frequencies this resembles an envelope extraction, while for lower frequencies additionally the phase information of the input signal is preserved. At this stage adaptation loops, developed by P uschel <ref> [9] </ref> to model forward masking, are applied to each channel to model nonlinear amplitude compression and temporal masking effects. These adaptation loops are build up of five similar division elements, in which the fedback and low-pass filtered output of each element serves as the divisor of that element.

Reference-contexts: All the subjective listening tests were carried out at and the speech material was made available by the Research Center of Deutsche Telekom AG, Berlin. The first test was the ETSI Halfrate Selection Test in German language. Another two tests were internal tests <ref> [10] </ref> for the quality evaluation of multiply cascaded ADPCM-codecs, one test (C 1) with simulated, the other (C 2)with real net-connections.

Reference-contexts: This compressive characteristic is appropriate both for stationary parts of the signal where the input x is transformed approximately logarithmically, and for sections of the signal exhibiting temporal masking effects (e. g. backward-, simultaneous-, forward masking and gaps). This conclusion is supported by the speech recognition experiments of Tchorz <ref> [11] </ref>. The same perception model preprocessing as described in this paper was applied as a feature extraction method for speech recognizing algorithms. In conditions with noisy background, the speech recognition rates were more robust than standard LPC- or RASTA-PLP-coefficients .
