Reference-contexts: Second, the hypothesis has a rapidly growing body of credible consequences. We summarize recently discovered such consequences [16, 7, 15] and prove two new consequences, namely the class separation E 6= NE and (building on recent work of Bellare and Goldwasser <ref> [1] </ref>) the existence of NP search problems that are not reducible to the corresponding decision problems. 2 In section 4 we prove our Main Theorem. In section 5, we prove that, if NP is not small, then many truth-table reducibilities are distinct in NP. <p> A particularly intuitive interpretation of this latter condition is in terms of certain algorithmic betting strategies, called martingales. Definition. A martingale is a density function d that satisfies condition (3.1) with equality, i.e., a function d : f0; 1g fl ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that d (w) = 2 for all w 2 f0; 1g fl . <p> Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.9. 2 Corollary 3.11. If NP does not have p-measure 0, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision problem. Proof. Bellare and Goldwasser <ref> [1] </ref> have shown that, if EE 6= NEE, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision problem.

Reference-contexts: Since A is P-immune, it follows that A " T 62 P, whence (A) 62 EE. Thus (A) 2 NEE EE, so EE 6= NEE. Note also that A " T is a tally language in NP P. The existence of such a language is known <ref> [3] </ref> to be equivalent to E 6= NE. The proof of 2 is similar. 2 Theorem 3.10. 1. If NP does not have p-measure 0, then E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE. 2.

Reference-contexts: To date, even this more modest objective has not been achieved. The Main Theorem of this paper, Theorem 4.1 below, says that the CvKL Conjecture follows from the hypothesis that "NP does not have p-measure 0". This hypothesis, whose formulation involves resource-bounded measure <ref> [14, 13] </ref> (a complexity-theoretic generalization of Lebesgue measure), is explained in detail in section 3 below. Very roughly speaking, the hypothesis says that "NP is not small," in the sense that NP contains more than a negligible subset of the languages decidable in exponential time. <p> Thus, for t : N ! N, DTIMEF (t) is the set of all functions f : f0; 1g fl ! f0; 1g fl such that f (x) is computable in O (t (jxj)) time. Similarly, PF = S 1 k=0 DTIMEF (n k ). (For technical reasons <ref> [13] </ref>, when discussing resource bounds for measure, we will deviate from this practice, writing p for PF, etc., as in section 3 below). We will discuss a variety of specialized polynomial-time reducibilities, in addition to the well-known reducibilities P T and P m , mentioned in the intro duction. <p> Inevitably, our discussion begins with a review of measure in complexity classes. Resource-bounded measure <ref> [14, 13] </ref> is a very general theory whose special cases include classical Lebesgue measure, the measure structure of the class REC of all recursive languages, and measure in various complexity classes.

Inevitably, our discussion begins with a review of measure in complexity classes. <p> We have shown that the hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0 separates P T -completeness ("Cook completeness") from P m -completeness ("Karp-Levin completeness") in NP. However, there is a large spectrum of completeness notions between P T and P m . Watanabe <ref> [26, 27] </ref> and Buhrman, Homer, and Torenvliet [4] have shown that nearly all these completeness notions are distinct in E and in NE, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Under the stronger hypothesis E 6= NE " coNE, Selman proved that the reducibilities P T and P m are distinct in NP. 2. Ko and Moore [9] constructed a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for E. Watanabe <ref> [26, 27] </ref> refined this by separating a spectrum of completeness notions in E. 3. Watanabe and Tang [28] exhibited reasonable complexity-theoretic hypotheses implying the existence of languages that are P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for PSPACE. 4. <p> Watanabe [26, 27] refined this by separating a spectrum of completeness notions in E. 3. Watanabe and Tang [28] exhibited reasonable complexity-theoretic hypotheses implying the existence of languages that are P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for PSPACE. 4. Watanabe <ref> [27] </ref> and Buhrman, Homer, and Torenvliet [4] constructed languages that are P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NE. 5. <p> For more details on these reducibilities, see <ref> [10, 24, 25, 26, 27, 6, 4] </ref>. 3 If NP Is Not Small In this section we discuss the meaning and reasonableness of the hypothesis that NP is not small.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, all known, natural P T -complete languages for NP are also P m -complete. Nevertheless, it is widely conjectured (e.g., <ref> [10, 29, 12, 6] </ref>) that Cook completeness is more general than Karp-Levin completeness: CvKL Conjecture. ("Cook versus Karp-Levin"). There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP.
