Abstract: Confounding, measurement error and selection bias are major concerns in observational studies. In a study of sleep disorders motivating our research, it was suspected that one or more of these problems were the cause of inconsistencies between regression coefficients obtained by different methods. We discuss such possibilities by examining the effect of omitted confounding variables on the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach and on conditional logistic regression. Assuming that a covariate z ij is unmeasured or otherwise omitted, we specify a structure with normally distributed x i and z i that allows their relationship to be different within and between individuals. This may arise, for example, from differences between persons entering the study at different ages or from time trends. The structure may also be interpreted as describing certain types of measurement error and selection bias. We find that fitting a model which includes x i: yields the correct mean structure, hence the same limit with any working correlation for GEE. However, fitting a model without x i: , using exchangeable working correlation in certain situations yields different results for different assumed correlations. When the working correlation approaches 1, the coefficient of x ij approaches the one in the model with x i: . This latter coefficient, for the logit link, can be converted into the one for conditional logistic regression by a scale change.

Reference-contexts: If dietary habits set in childhood promote lower fat intake in older generations, R 1 is less than 0. If, intake also increased with time due to availability of fat-rich, pre-processed foods R 2 is greater than 0. By well-known relationships for the multivariate normal distribution <ref> (Andersen, 1984) </ref>, the conditional distributions of z ij jx i and z ij jx ij are z ij jx i ~ N R 2 C 2 x ij + r k x i: 1 C 1 + 2 p 1 =r k 2 2 C 2 (1 1=k) ; (4) 1

Reference-contexts: Possibilities include differences in life style leaving younger persons sleep deprived. Selection bias may have arisen from individuals in the work force who are tired taking early retirement or otherwise resigning. A recent report <ref> (Bliwise, 1996) </ref> indicates that admission of tiredness is more likely among contemporary men than it was among men in the pre World War II era. Older individuals may have retained some of this attitude, leading to generation related measurement error in the response.

Reference-contexts: The term involving z ij in (1) may be viewed as modeling an error in either y ij or x ij . In the latter case, when R 1 = 0 and R 2 = 0 (1) fulfills the assumptions of the simplest Berkson type measurement error model <ref> (Carroll, et al, 1995) </ref>. This may arise, for example if x ij is an intended dose of a drug, but random (unknown) errors This is page 4 Printer: Opaque this are made in its administration.

Reference-contexts: Increasing gives decreasing weight to between individual confounding. We also observe that when approaches 1, the limiting value in (8) approaches the coefficient of x ij in (6). We now investigate the implications of confounding for estimation by conditional logistic regression <ref> (see e.g. Conaway, 1989 for a general formulation) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the parameters R 1 and R 2 allow for different degree of confounding by z within and between individuals, as may be the case for cohort and period effects <ref> (see e.g. Dwyer, 1992) </ref>. For example, Newschaffer et al. (1992) considered decline in cholesterol with age among the aged, and found both cohort and period effects. Hypothetically, our scenario could apply as follows. Assume that x is age, and z is intake of saturated fat.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, when subject effects are present, the coefficient fi fl in (6) is equal to fi CL multiplied by 1= 1 + c 2 , where = 2 ff fl =[1 + c 2 fl 2 2 2 )]. can be estimated by maximum likelihood [available software: MIXOR <ref> (Hedeker and Gibbons, 1994) </ref> ]. Related topics are discussed in Palta and Lin (1996). We note that the conditional logistic regression coefficient is subject only to time point level confounding. Also, the random variation terms ff fl i need not be normally distributed for conditional logistic estimation.

Reference-contexts: We note that the conditional logistic regression coefficient is subject only to time point level confounding. Also, the random variation terms ff fl i need not be normally distributed for conditional logistic estimation. By the well known approximate relationship between the logistic and normal distributions <ref> (Johnson and Kotz, 1970, P.6) </ref>, the conditional logistic approach can also be applied to estimate probit coefficients. 6 Monte Carlo results We investigated the accuracy of formula (8) by Monte Carlo studies. Data were generated from a latent structure as described by Chao, Palta, and Young (1996).

Reference-contexts: When R 2 6= 0 and/or R 1 6= 0, a situation of dependent measurement error arises. A well known example <ref> (see Kleinbaum et al., 1982) </ref> can be interpreted in a similar way. In studying the association of endometrial cancer and estrogen supplementation in post-menopausal women, let -ij be a latent true malignancy level, which is measured with error. Denote by y ij the resulting diagnosis of cancer.

Reference-contexts: Recently, estimating regression coefficients for such data by generalized estimating equations (GEE) has become popular. This is partly due to the assurance of estimation consistency as long as the mean structure is correctly specified, even if the variance structure is not <ref> (Liang and Zeger, 1986) </ref>. Especially in observational studies, however, questions arise whether the mean structure is indeed correct and what the consequences might be otherwise. For example, interest may be focused on possible omission of confounding covariates from the model.

Reference-contexts: We derive approximate formulas for asymptotic expectation of regression coefficients obtained by different working correlation matrices in GEE. These are compared to those from conditional logistic regression. In a study of sleep disorders <ref> (Young et al.,1993) </ref> we consider how the above forms of bias and misspecification may explain contradictory findings. A sample of 3,102 Wisconsin State employees received questionnaires 4 years apart. <p> (0.010) 0.027 (0.006) coefficient of x i: is -0.049 (0.011). 7 Sleep survey results The methodologic questions considered in this paper arose from a cohort study of sleep disorders among persons who were age 30-60 years and state employees in Wisconsin at the time of a baseline survey during 1989-1992 <ref> (Young et al., 1993) </ref>. A total of 3,102 individuals answered this as well as a followup survey in 1994.
