Title: A Uniform Treatment of Pragmatic Inferences in Simple and Complex Utterances and Sequences of Utterances

Abstract: Drawing appropriate defeasible inferences has been proven to be one of the most pervasive puzzles of natural language processing and a recurrent problem in pragmatics. This paper provides a theoretical framework, called stratified logic, that can accommodate defeasible pragmatic inferences. The framework yields an algorithm that computes the conversational, conventional, scalar, clausal, and normal state implicatures; and the presuppositions that are associated with utterances. The algorithm applies equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances.

Reference-contexts: For example, Hirschberg (1985) has shown that in order to understand a scalar implicature, one must analyze the con-versants' beliefs and intentions. To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans <ref> (Green, 1990) </ref>. To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations (Green, 1992; Green and Carberry, 1994). Some presuppositions are in-ferrable when certain lexical constructs (factives, aspectuals, etc) or syntactic constructs (cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences) are used.

Reference-contexts: Note that there is a gap of one statement between the generation and the cancellation of this presupposition. The behavior described is mirrored both by our theory and our program. 3.4 Conversational implicatures in indirect replies The same methodology can be applied to modeling conversational implicatures in indirect replies <ref> (Green, 1992) </ref>. Green's algorithm makes use of discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations. The following dialog is considered (Green, 1992, p. 68): (17) Q: Did you go shopping? A: a. My car's not running. b. The timing belt broke. c. (So) I had to take the bus. <p> Green's algorithm makes use of discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations.

Answer (17) conveys a "yes", but a reply consisting only of (17)a would implicate a "no".

Reference-contexts: Context (Karttunen, 1974; Kay, 1992), procedural rules (Gazdar, 1979; Karttunen and Peters, 1979), lexical and syntactic structure (Weischedel, 1979), intentions <ref> (Hirschberg, 1985) </ref>, or anaphoric constraints (Sandt, 1992; Zeevat, 1992) decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed.

Reference-contexts: However, after that utterance is analyzed, there is no possibility left of cancelling that inference. But it is natural to have implicatures and presuppositions that are inferred and cancelled as a sequence of utterances proceeds: research in conversation repairs <ref> (Hirst et al., 1994) </ref> abounds in such examples. We address this issue in more detail in section 3.3. 2.

Reference-contexts: 16 models, but only Chris is an adult satisfies definition 2.2 and is projected as presupposition for the utterance. 3.3 Pragmatic inferences in sequences of utterances We have already mentioned that speech repairs constitute a good benchmark for studying the generation and cancellation of pragmatic inferences along sequences of utterances <ref> (McRoy and Hirst, 1993) </ref>. Suppose, for example, that Jane has two friends | John Smith and John Pevler | and that her roommate Mary has met only John Smith, a married fellow.

Reference-contexts: Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of de-feasible information. Mercer (1987) formalizes presuppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref>, but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-or and implication as logical equivalence. Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppositions (Weischedel, 1979) or implicatures (Hirschberg, 1985; Green, 1992) are generated, they can never be cancelled.

Reference-contexts: We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism, and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences. The results we report here are obtained using an implementation written in Common Lisp that uses Screamer <ref> (Siskind and McAllester, 1993) </ref>, a macro package that provides nondeterministic constructs. 2 Stratified logic 2.1 Theoretical foundations We can offer here only a brief overview of stratified logic. The reader is referred to Marcu (1994) for a comprehensive study.

Reference-contexts: Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances, including the current one. Context (Karttunen, 1974; Kay, 1992), procedural rules (Gazdar, 1979; Karttunen and Peters, 1979), lexical and syntactic structure <ref> (Weischedel, 1979) </ref>, intentions (Hirschberg, 1985), or anaphoric constraints (Sandt, 1992; Zeevat, 1992) decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed. <p> Mercer (1987) formalizes presuppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults (Reiter, 1980), but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-or and implication as logical equivalence.
