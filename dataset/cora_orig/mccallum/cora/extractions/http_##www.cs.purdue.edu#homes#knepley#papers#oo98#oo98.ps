Title: Algorithm Development for Large Scale Computing  
Author: Matthew G. Knepley Vivek Sarin 
Abstract: We present a case study examining the creation of an efficient preconditioner for solution of incompressible flow problems. We trace algorithm development from theoretical considerations, through initial implementation and testing, to parallel performance for large-scale systems. We demonstrate that early coupling of the development process with existing code can reduce debugging time and ease the transition from toy problems to real applications.

Reference-contexts: In order to demonstrate the strengths of our development methodology, we first discuss a powerful new multilevel preconditioner for saddle-point linear systems. This preconditioner has been integrated into a particulate flow simulation developed as part of an NSF Grand Challenge project <ref> [3] </ref>. An initial implementation in Mathematica was designed to function not only as a standalone program, but also as a module which communicated with the existing code through a well-defined interface. <p> Mathematical or algorithmic objects use the equation typeface, B. 2 The Multilevel Preconditioner We present an outline of the multilevel preconditioner due to Sarin and Sameh [2], and its specific application to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Reference-contexts: The functions which implement each feature are detailed in appendix for those interested in the details of the code, and can be found in the accompanying notebook <ref> [4] </ref>. The mesh is first partitioned, which corresponds to a partition of the columns of ~ B, and then the rows are divided into three cataegories: interior rows lying exclusively in one partition, boundary rows connecting two partitions, and residual rows connecting three or more partitions. <p> The channel has a solid impenetrable bottom and is 3.20 inches wide. The C application code was run on the SGI Origin2000 at NCSA utilizing up to 32 processors. The Mathematica code can also run in a distributed environment, and is freely available <ref> [4] </ref>. 6.1 Sedimentation of a Single Particle This problem simulates the sedimentation of a single disk from rest at a position in which the disk center is 30 inches above the bottom of the channel and half way between the left wall and the centerline.
