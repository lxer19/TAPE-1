Abstract: Suppose we wish to decide which of two treatments is better, where the outcomes are Bernoulli random variables, the success probabilities of which, themselves, are modeled as independent beta random variables. Assume that the maximal population size for the experiment is fixed, but that the length of the study and the number and order of patients assigned to each treatment may be random. Our goal is to maximize the likelihood of making the correct decision by utilizing a curtailed equal allocation rule, but we wish to do so with a minimal average study length. We show that this experimental design problem reduces to a problem of optimal adaptive allocation which can be solved exactly using dynamic programming. We compare the optimal allocation procedure to the commonly-used approach of curtailed alternating allocation and show that the optimal allocation procedure is noticeably superior. The evaluations of allocation procedures are all exact, calculated via backward induction. Since the optimal adaptive allocation procedure can be easily determined and evaluated on workstations, and stored on personal computers for ready access during experiments, it is a practical improvement over alternating allocation.

Reference-contexts: The variable M in Figure 1 denotes the number of patients treated so far, and the final value calculated, M L (0; 0; 0; 0), is the answer. While this is similar to Bellman's classic dynamic programming algorithm, <ref> [1] </ref>, to minimize expected failures, there is a critical difference. With equal allocation procedures, there are states for which allocating one or the other of the treatments is prohibited.

The special relevance of Berry and Eick [2] is that it is one of the few papers of which we are aware that utilizes backward induction to perform exact evaluations of non-recursive procedures. In their paper, the goal was to attain a tradeoff between failures and the probability of selecting the better treatment, without curtailment. <p> Intuitively, in such an approach, for fixed N , increasing P increases the importance of correctly selecting the better treatment, while decreasing P increases the importance of minimizing failures during the initial study. While this idea is certainly not unique to Berry and Eick <ref> [2] </ref>, the approach that they take with respect to "selecting the better treatment" is a Bayesian notion. In this paper we use a frequentist version of the properties of the decision rule and a Bayesian version of average study length.
