Abstract: Because of the rapid expansion of the Internet, a larger address space is needed. This necessitates the new Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) with expanded addressing capability. Comparing to the existing Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), the new version is more powerful both in the number of addresses that can be specified and how they are specified. I will first examine the problem with the 32-bit IPv4 address, then discuss some of the other addressing schemes proposed, and finally describe the new 128-bit IPv6 address and evaluate it in the context presented. The IPv4 node address consists of 32 bits divided into network portion and host portion. It is designed to exibly address three classes of networks: A) a small number of networks with a large number of host, B) a moderate number of networks with a moderate number of hosts, and C) a large number of networks with a small number of hosts.

Reference-contexts: This is primarily used for administrative service. Routing will be done on the entire 48 bit AD+ network number. As accountability was not one of the main goals for the Internet <ref> [DSGN-PHIL] </ref>, it was one weak area of the original protocol. The AD is one step towards making the protocol easier to administer. The goal of TP/IX is keeping things as simple as before. So the new addressing scheme will work essentially the same way as before.

Reference-contexts: Region addresses should also aid in solving the problem, as well be discussed below.[IPV6-SPEC] 3.1 Addressing Architecture The IPv6 host address are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and sets of interfaces. There are three kinds of addresses <ref> [IPV6-ADDR] </ref>: Addressing Architecture of IPv6 May 17, 1995 6 Unicast: Identifier for a single interface. Packets sent to a unicast address are delivered to the interface identified by that address. Region: Identifier for a set of interfaces on the border of a region.

Reference-contexts: So overall it could be as fast. This remains to be determined in real use. The new 32-bit ow field in the new IPv6 protocol <ref> [IPV6-SPEC] </ref> can also be used to cache routes, since two packets with same ow label are most likely going to the same interface. This could mean significant savings of routing time.

Reference-contexts: Address handling will be only a small part of the whole change. To make the transition less painful, the IPv6 transition mechanisms <ref> [IPV6-TRANS] </ref> include a technique for hosts and routers to dynamically tunnel IPv6 packets over IPv4 routing infrastructure. IPv6 nodes that uses this technique are assigned special IPv6 unicast addresses that carry an IPv4 address in the low-order 32-bits.

Reference-contexts: This is only used in certain ICMP messages. The extended addressing mode is undefined. Both of these features are reserved for future use. <ref> [RFC-791] </ref> While this scheme worked well for the small scientific and engineering community it was targeted for, it is facing problems now with more exponential growth in commercial and personal uses of the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The multicast address is denoted by the 11111111 prefix. It is an identifier for a group of interfaces. A packet addressed to a multicast address will be sent to all the interfaces identified by that address. Comparing to the IPv4 extension for IP Multicasting <ref> [RFC-1112] </ref>, a new scope field has been added to deal more efficiently with multicasting. The details are outside the scope of this paper. 3.1.1 Unicast Address I will concentrate on the unicast address in IPv6 currently under development.

Reference-contexts: it, exibility of adding improvements, and performance. 2.1 Aggregation (AD) The Internet Activities Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) met in a series of meeting in 1991 and came up with some agreement on the approach to the problem: aggregation for more efficient address allocation and routing. <ref> [RFC-1287] </ref> Addressing Architecture of IPv6 May 17, 1995 3 Aggregation involves aggregating network numbers into large units (such as administration domain, or AD) as the basis for routing. These units define regions where different routing policy may apply, controls the number of routing elements, and provide elements for network management.

Reference-contexts: With the number of network numbers assigned roughly doubling every 12 months, the Class B network numbers will quickly run out unless corrective measures are taken. <ref> [RFC-1335] </ref> With more and more networks connected to the Internet, the amount of routing information that needs to be passed around to manage them also grows rapidly. Routing protocols must relate this information, and routers must store and use it. <p> It is also unclear what would be the best way to partition the current Internet, so that inter-internet traffic can be minimized. 2.4 DNA The Dual Network Addressing (DNA) scheme is proposed by Wang and Crowcroft in May 1992. <ref> [RFC-1335] </ref> A similar scheme was also proposed by Rekhter and others in March 1994. [RFC-1597] DNA is based on a two-tier address structure and sharing of addresses. In this scheme, there are two types of Internet addresses: Internal address and External address.

Reference-contexts: Addressing Architecture of IPv6 May 17, 1995 2 1.2 Growth-Related Problems with IPv4 The Internet now faces three growth-related problems: Class B network number exhaustion, routing table explosion, and IP address space exhaustion. <ref> [RFC-1380] </ref> Since the Class C network number only applies to networks with 254 or less hosts, many networks need more connections than that, so they need one of the 16,383 (only) Class B numbers. <p> The cost of the scheme is outweighed by the benefits. 2.2 Routing The IESG met again in a series of meetings in 1992 to clarify the problems of routing table explosion and IP address exhaustion and search for solutions. <ref> [RFC-1380] </ref> For handling the routing problem, four general approaches were discussed: 1) Aggregation of routing information. As in the meeting from 1991, this group meeting again confirmed the need for built-in hierarchy in the address to allow for more efficient routing. 2) More thrust on routing.

Reference-contexts: If we have a large number of these servers, then the benefit of this scheme will quickly disappear and leave us the same problem of IP address exhaustion. 2.5 TP/IX TP/IX is a new version of Internet Protocol proposed by R. Ullmann in June 1993 <ref> [RFC-1475] </ref>. It advocates a simple network protocol that incorporates the best parts of IPv4 and fixes only what is broken.

Reference-contexts: unclear what would be the best way to partition the current Internet, so that inter-internet traffic can be minimized. 2.4 DNA The Dual Network Addressing (DNA) scheme is proposed by Wang and Crowcroft in May 1992. [RFC-1335] A similar scheme was also proposed by Rekhter and others in March 1994. <ref> [RFC-1597] </ref> DNA is based on a two-tier address structure and sharing of addresses. In this scheme, there are two types of Internet addresses: Internal address and External address. The Internal one is used only within a network and is unique only within that network.

Reference-contexts: So theoretically it is capable of addressing 2^96 (!) times as many hosts. Are all these bits really necessary? Perhaps. C. Huitema of INRIA presents an interesting argument for it in November 1994. <ref> [RFC-1715] </ref> Most people evaluate assignment efficiency of addresses as a ratio of the effective number of systems in the network over the theoretical maximum. So for the existing system, one finds that 3.5 million assigned divided by 7 billion possible giving an efficiency of only 0.05%.
