Abstract: We show that in the worst case, (n dd=2e1 + n log n) sidedness queries are required to determine whether the convex hull of n points in IR d is simplicial, or to determine the number of convex hull facets. This lower bound matches known upper bounds in any odd dimension. Our result follows from a straightforward and completely constructive adversary argument. Using similar techniques, we also derive a constructive proof of Erickson and Seidel's lower bounds for detecting affine degeneracies in arbitrary dimensions. As a related result, we show that certain convex hull problems in IR d are dd=2esum-hard, in the sense of Gajentaan and Overmars. While it has been known for several years that d-dimensional convex hulls can have (n bd=2c ) facets, the previously best lower bound for either of the problems we consider is only (n log n).

Reference-contexts: It follows that both Graham's scan and Preparata and Hong's algorithm are optimal in the worst case.

There are a few convex hull algorithms which seem to fall outside our models of computation, most notably the divide and conquer algorithm of Chan, Snoeyink, and Yap <ref> [5] </ref>. The two-dimensional version of their algorithm uses sidedness queries, along with first-, second-, and even third -order comparisons; higher-dimensional versions use more complex queries. 7 Related Results Using similar methods, we can derive a very simple proof of the following theorem of Erickson and Seidel.

Reference-contexts: We explicitly construct a set of points whose convex hull is simplicial, but includes several collapsible simplices. An adversary can collapse each of these simplices independently, creating a new degenerate facet. Our argument is similar to earlier arguments of Erickson and Seidel [12] and the author <ref> [11] </ref>. In contrast to these results, however, our proofs are completely constructive. In fact, our proof technique yields a constructive proof of Erickson and Seidel's lower bounds for affine degeneracy detection in arbitrary dimensions. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains some geometric preliminaries. <p> The problem rsum can be solved in time O (n (r+1)=2 ) when r is odd, or in time O (n r=2 log n) when r is even, or with a non-uniform algorithm in time O (n dr=2e ) for all r &gt; 2 <ref> [11] </ref>. We conjecture that these algorithms are optimal, although the best lower bound in any general model of computation, for any fixed r, is only (n log n) [3]. Theorem 3.1. Deciding whether the convex hull of n points in IR d is simplicial is dd=2esum-hard. <p> In particular, Theorem 3.1 tells us absolutely nothing about the four-dimensional case, since we already have a lower bound of (n log n) in all dimensions. In an earlier paper <ref> [11] </ref>, we derived an (n dr=2e ) lower bound for rsum in the r-linear decision tree model, matching the non-uniform upper bounds. In this model, decisions are based on the signs of arbitrary affine combinations of r or fewer input variables. <p> Quadratic lower bounds for either the five-dimensional convex hull problem or the two-dimensional affine degeneracy problem in stronger models of computation would imply similar lower bounds for a number of other 3sum-hard problems. While the lower bounds we prove here and in earlier papers <ref> [12, 11] </ref> are in fairly natural models, there are still 3sum-hard problems that cannot even be solved in these models. For example, one of the simplest problems for which our techniques fail is finding the minimum area triangle determined by a set of points in the plane.

Reference-contexts: Since an n-vertex polytope in IR d can have (n bd=2c ) facets [30], Chazelle's algorithm is optimal in the worst case. Several faster algorithms are known when the output size is also considered; see for example <ref> [4, 5, 9, 10, 17, 25] </ref>. In this paper, we consider convex hull problems for which the output size is a single integer, or even a single bit, although the convex hull itself may be large. <p> These include the "gift-wrapping" algorithms of Chand and Kapur [6] and Swart [28], the "beneath-beyond" method of Seidel [23], Clarkson and Shor's [10] and Seidel's [26] randomized incremental algorithms, Chazelle's worst-case optimal algorithm [7], and the recursive algorithm of Clarkson [9]. Seidel's "shelling" algorithm <ref> [25] </ref> and the space-efficient gift-wrapping algorithms of Avis and Fukuda 2 [2] and Rote [21] require only sidedness queries and second-order comparisons. Ma-tousek [19] and Chan [4] improve the running times of these algorithms (in an output-sensitive sense), by finding the extreme points more quickly.

Reference-contexts: If we represent the points of IR d in homogeneous coordinates, a projective transformation is equivalent to a linear transformation of IR d+1 . In Stolfi's two-sided projective model <ref> [27] </ref>, projective maps preserve (or reverse) the orientation of every simplex in IR d , and thus preserve the combinatorial structure of convex hulls. (See Chapter 14 of [27].) Let X be the set of numbers described in the proof of Lemma 4.1. <p> In Stolfi's two-sided projective model <ref> [27] </ref>, projective maps preserve (or reverse) the orientation of every simplex in IR d , and thus preserve the combinatorial structure of convex hulls. (See Chapter 14 of [27].) Let X be the set of numbers described in the proof of Lemma 4.1. We call an algebraic query allowable if for some projective transformation , the configuration (! d (X)) is nondegenerate with respect to that query. Our choice of terminology is justified by the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: Over twenty years ago, Graham described an algorithm that constructs the convex hull of n points in the plane in O (n log n) time. The same running time was achieved in three dimensions by Preparata and Hong [20]. Yao <ref> [29] </ref> proved a lower bound of (n log n) on the complexity of identifying the convex hull vertices, in the quadratic decision tree model. This lower bound was later generalized to the algebraic decision tree and algebraic computation tree models by Ben-Or [3]. <p> This matches known upper bounds when d is odd [7]. The only lower bound previously known for either of these problems is (n log n), following from the techniques of Yao <ref> [29] </ref> and Ben-Or [3]. Our lower bounds follow from a straightforward adversary argument. We explicitly construct a set of points whose convex hull is simplicial, but includes several collapsible simplices. An adversary can collapse each of these simplices independently, creating a new degenerate facet.

Reference-contexts: Chazelle [7] describes an algorithm for constructing convex hulls in IR d in time O (n bd=2c +n log n). Since an n-vertex polytope in IR d can have (n bd=2c ) facets <ref> [30] </ref>, Chazelle's algorithm is optimal in the worst case. Several faster algorithms are known when the output size is also considered; see for example [4, 5, 9, 10, 17, 25]. <p> Section 7 contains some related results. Finally, in Section 8, we summarize and suggest directions for further research. 2 Geometric Preliminaries 2.1 Definitions We begin by reviewing basic terminology. For a more detailed introduction to the theory of convex polytopes, we refer the reader to Ziegler <ref> [30] </ref> or Grunbaum [15]. A hyperplane h supports a convex polytope if the polytope intersects h and lies in a closed halfspace of h. The intersection of a convex polytope and a supporting hyperplane is called a face of the polytope. <p> A determinantal formula for Schur polynomials was discovered by Jacobi in the mid-1800's [16]. The next lemma characterizes degenerate convex hull facets on the weird moment curve. The result is similar to Gale's evenness condition <ref> [30, Lemma 0.7] </ref>, which describes which vertices of a cyclic polytope form its facets. Lemma 2.2. <p> Since no d points on the weird moment curve lie on a single (d 2)-flat, these polytopes are quasi-simplicial. fl This result is the best possible when d is odd, since an odd dimensional n-vertex polytope has at most O (n (d1)=2 ) facets <ref> [30] </ref>. In the case where d is even, the best known upper bound is O (n d=2 ), which is a factor of n bigger than the result we prove here. We conjecture that this upper bound is tight.
