Abstract: We discuss the persistence of the indirect effects of an action|the question when such effects are subject to the commonsense law of inertia, and how to describe their evolution in the cases when inertia does not apply. Our model of nonpersistent effects involves the assumption that the value of the fluent in question is determined by the values of other fluents, although the dependency may be partially or completely unknown. This view leads us to a new high-level action language ARD (for Actions, Ramifications and Dependencies) that is capable of describing both persistent and nonpersistent effects. Unlike the action languages introduced in the past, ARD is "non-Markovian," in the sense that the evolution of the fluents described in this language may depend on their history, and not only on their current values.

Reference-contexts: Somehow, the law of inertia does not apply. The ramifications similar to Example 1 are by now well understood.

In the more difficult case of "noninertial ramifications," illustrated by Example 2, little progress has been made.

Reference-contexts: More specifically, we are interested in what Myers and Smith [1988] called the persistence of derived information|in deciding whether the indirect effects of an action should be presumed to persist, or, in other words, whether they are subject to the commonsense law of inertia. Compare two examples: Example 1 <ref> [ Crawford, 1994 ] </ref> . If you are in the lake then you are wet. Jumping in the lake has an indirect effect|getting wet. Example 2 [ Myers and Smith, 1988 ] .

Reference-contexts: The new language extends the action language AR from <ref> [ Giunchiglia et al., 1994 ] </ref> and is called ARD|for Actions, Ramifications and Dependencies. The properties of ARD are investigated in Section 5. 2 Dependencies There is nothing peculiar about the fact that some flu-ents are "inertial" and others are not. <p> Additional information about the past can be used to learn the values of the implicit components, and consequently to arrive at new predictions. 3 Formalization of the Examples Example 1 can be easily represented in the language AR <ref> [ Giunchiglia et al., 1994 ] </ref> , or even in its dialect AR 0 from [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] . <p> About the language AR <ref> [ Giunchiglia et al., 1994 ] </ref> it suffices to know that it differs from AR 0 in two ways. First, fluents in AR do not have to be propositional; their values can come from any domains.

Reference-contexts: accounts of this case of the ramification problem, in various contexts, were given in [ Ginsberg and Smith, 1988 ] , [ Winslett, 1988 ] , [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] , [ Baker, 1991 ] , [ Lifschitz, 1991 ] , [ Lin and Shoham, 1991 ] , <ref> [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] </ref> . In the more difficult case of "noninertial ramifications," illustrated by Example 2, little progress has been made. Myers and Smith [1988] identified the problem, gave a few instructive examples and sketched an approach based on default logic. <p> the past can be used to learn the values of the implicit components, and consequently to arrive at new predictions. 3 Formalization of the Examples Example 1 can be easily represented in the language AR [ Giunchiglia et al., 1994 ] , or even in its dialect AR 0 from <ref> [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] </ref> . <p> In this case, the set of all states in the sense of AR is the only maximal coherent dependency. Several properties of AR 0 established in <ref> [ Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] </ref> can be proved for ARD as well.

Reference-contexts: For example, the law of inertia is often restricted to "primitive fluents" and is not applied to their propositional combinations in [ Myers and Smith, 1988 ] and [ Baker, 1991 ] . Several examples when fluents change "by themselves" are given in <ref> [ Lifschitz and Rabinov, 1989 ] </ref> . In [ Lifschitz, 1990 ] , a subset of fluents is designated as a "frame," and a fluent is assumed to be inertial only if it belongs to the frame.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, adding a value proposition to a domain description can only make the set of its models smaller, and hence the set of value propositions entailed by it bigger (a "restricted monotonicity property" in the sense of <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> ). Any formula can be replaced by an equivalent formula without changing the set of models, and explicitly defined fluent names can be eliminated.

Reference-contexts: Compare two examples: Example 1 [ Crawford, 1994 ] . If you are in the lake then you are wet. Jumping in the lake has an indirect effect|getting wet. Example 2 <ref> [ Myers and Smith, 1988 ] </ref> . If an object is on the table then it is not dangerous for the baby crawling on the floor. Putting an object on the table has an indirect effect|making it safe. The examples look similar. <p> The properties of ARD are investigated in Section 5. 2 Dependencies There is nothing peculiar about the fact that some flu-ents are "inertial" and others are not. For example, the law of inertia is often restricted to "primitive fluents" and is not applied to their propositional combinations in <ref> [ Myers and Smith, 1988 ] </ref> and [ Baker, 1991 ] . Several examples when fluents change "by themselves" are given in [ Lifschitz and Rabinov, 1989 ] . <p> The explicit components of these states are the same, but their dependencies are different. The transition diagram of this system is depicted in 2 Dependency propositions are somewhat similar to the formulas INESSENTIAL (p; q) used in <ref> [ Myers and Smith, 1988 ] </ref> .
