Abstract: Bulky head-mounted displays, data gloves, and severely limited movement have become synonymous with virtual environments. In this paper we describe an interactive virtual environment (IVE) that uses only a large field of view screen and passive sensors, in this case a video camera and microphone. Special clothing and modifications to the environment are not necessary (i.e. chroma-key backdrops are not required). Such a system has many advantages: ease of access when entering and exiting the environment, more active participation, and social context. These attributes are demonstrated in SURVIVE, a multi-player gesture-driven adaption of id Software's game

Reference-contexts: In order to allow a user to navigate a three dimensional space, most commercial systems encumber the user with head-mounted displays, electromagnetic or sonic position sensors, gloves, and/or body suits <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . While such systems can be extremely accurate, they limit the freedom of the user due to the tethers associated with the sensors and displays. Furthermore, the user must don or remove the equipment each time he wants to enter or exit the environment.
