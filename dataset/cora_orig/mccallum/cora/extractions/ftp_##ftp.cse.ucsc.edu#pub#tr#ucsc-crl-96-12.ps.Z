Abstract: In this report I formulate analog layout constraints and survey the state of the art of automatic analog layout systems, which can handle only few analog constraints, and generate less dense layout. To solve these problems I propose a new interactive analog layout methodology. It provides topological editing in the geometrical view based on Rubber-band routing. The purposes of this new methodology are i)to overcome the difficulty of control the layout parasitic elements with irregularities of analog devices and wiring effects and ii)to reduce the analog VLSI design period. After describing new concepts for that interactive methodology, I state some specific challenges.

Reference-contexts: The channel routing style is not suitable for analog circuits, because it requires a rectangler routing region|analog components come in many shapes and requiring a rectangular region is too restrictive. 3.2 Automatic Layout Tool KOAN/ANAGRAMII <ref> [CGRC91] </ref> is an automatic layout tool for device-level analog placement and routing. The placement program KOAN handles device matching and complex symmetric layout, including mirror-symmetry and self-symmetry, as analog layout constraints. KOAN can also handle dynamic merging and abutment of individual devices and generate well and bulk contacts. <p> This system is admirable because of the way it represents analog constraints in its cost functions. But the resulting layout densities are sparse <ref> [CGRC91] </ref>. The size of one example is one and half times that of the manual layout. They consider wire length in the placement step, but they might not consider the regions where the wires exist.

Reference-contexts: In this formulation the first term models non-spatially correlated effects due to local process variations, e.g. mobility variation and oxide charge variation. The second term represents spatial effects due to global process gradients, e.g. oxide thickness gradients and dopant diffusion gradients <ref> [CGRC94] </ref>. The circuit designer determines the value at which the mismatch variance given by equation 2.2 is no longer negligible and uses it along with other cost considerations to determine the maximum limit Xmax. 2.3.2 Crosstalk effect Another important electrical behavior concern is crosstalk.

Reference-contexts: Analog layout constraints 9 3. Previous work 3.1 Channel Routing for an analog module The channel router for an analog module ART [CSV93] uses a constraint-based algorithm. Analog layout constraints are generated by a parasitic constraint generator called PARCAR <ref> [CSV90] </ref> using sensitivity analysis from the performance information. ART handles matching constraints and bounding constraints based on wire capacitance. Matching constraints require elements to have the exact same parasitic values as the input constraint values. This includes symmetrical patterns.

Reference-contexts: So these sensitive devices must be placed symmetrically with respect to the thermal radiating device (Figure 2.6). 8 2. Analog layout constraints 9 3. Previous work 3.1 Channel Routing for an analog module The channel router for an analog module ART <ref> [CSV93] </ref> uses a constraint-based algorithm. Analog layout constraints are generated by a parasitic constraint generator called PARCAR [CSV90] using sensitivity analysis from the performance information. ART handles matching constraints and bounding constraints based on wire capacitance. <p> Each horizontal segment of a net is represented as a node in the graph. Then ART assigns each segment to a track to reduce the channel height while satisfying the constraints. After routing, if the layout pattern doesn't satisfy the constraints, the placement must be changed. In <ref> [CSV93] </ref> the authors said they would implement a placement program in the future. Obviously it is necessary to restrict the placement of some cells in order to create a symmetric channel wire pattern.

Reference-contexts: It considers device matching, symmetry, and distance and coupling constraints. These constraint descriptions are output by an interactive design tool IDAC <ref> [DND + 87] </ref>. The layout is produced by three steps: 1)primitive device level layout using a specialized layout generator, 2)cell layout with a parametric library or with an interactive way to a text file, and 3)cell placement and routing at the circuit level.

Reference-contexts: It maintains the topology of the Rubber-band sketch. This spoke creation step pushes wires near each terminal away with open-ended lines called spokes <ref> [Kon92] </ref>. An illustration for the octilinear geometry is given in Figure 4.2. The length of each spoke depends on the space rule and the width of the wire being pushed. The direction of a spoke depends on the geometrical restriction.

Reference-contexts: If a wire moves and its exit 16 5. Obstacles location is changed, the triangulation must be explicitly updated. However triangulating a single vertex has an expected complexity of O (1), so this should be acceptable <ref> [Lu91] </ref>. Another drawback of explicit obstacle embedding is that the size of the triangulation is increased. 5.2. New obstacle data representation 17 18 6.

Reference-contexts: When a member of my group evaluated KOAN/ANAGRAMII with a real circuit, it couldn't realize a layout that satisfied the complicated analog constraints. 3.3 Rule Based Approach A cooperative human-computer approach was proposed by Mogaki et al. <ref> [MSKH93] </ref>. Their goal is to provide an entire chip layout system for bipolar analog VLSI with a rule-based strategy. Their analog layout constraints are cell pair placement, crosstalk avoidance and symmetric wire patterns.

Reference-contexts: The reason for this is the lack of flexibility and global view, because a maze router determines the wire pattern of one net at a time. 3.4 Interactive Layout Tool On the other hand an analog CMOS layout generator ILAC <ref> [RLSD89] </ref> tried to adapt an interactive approach. It considers device matching, symmetry, and distance and coupling constraints. These constraint descriptions are output by an interactive design tool IDAC [DND + 87].

Reference-contexts: The reason is maybe that users can't improve both cell locations and wire patterns simultaneously due to the channel routing and compaction methods. 12 4. The layout system SURF 4. The layout system SURF SURF (Santa Cruz ULSI Routing Framework) <ref> [SSDD93] </ref> is an automatic/interactive layout tool. It has the following four features: 1) a flexible topological wiring representation known as a rubber-band sketch, 2) incremental design rule checking, 3) a graphical topological layout editor with on-line DRC, and 4) an automatic topological to geometrical wiring transformation.
