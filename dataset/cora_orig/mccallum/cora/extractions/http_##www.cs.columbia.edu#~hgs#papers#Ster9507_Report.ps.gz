Abstract: Report and Discussion on the IEEE ComSoc TCGN Gigabit Abstract This discussion session was intended to consider not only the relative merits of ATM/B-ISDN vs. IP as a network (layer 3) and internetwork (layer 3.5) infrastructure, but also since there were so many ATM contributions in the workshop, we decided to have Henning Schulzrinne presenting an IP-centric critique of ATM to initiate the discussion. In the following, we summarize some of the issues that may interfere with widespread deployment, particularly in heterogeneous nets owned by different service providers. Using ATM permanent virtual circuits as links between routers is proven technology and poses fewer challenges, except in the area of traffic integration. As with any network technology, ATM is evolving, so that some of the reservations may be moot in future revisions and capability sets. Indeed, important changes in ATM perception and technology have already taken place. To name but a few, the reduction from four to two adapation layers (AAL1 and AAL5), the use of ATM over ever lower bit rates, the lack of use for the generic flow control (GFC) header field, the rare use of SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) over DQDB (distributed queue dual bus) multiple access channels and the abandonment of service classes for more closely defined QOS parameters. But the evolvability of ATM certainly also applies to missing features of IP and its implementation in high-speed networks.
