Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for the reconstruction of work pieces and designer models from multiple range images. The range images are acquired with a 3D range image scanner. Due to occlusions and self-occlusions appearing naturally in range images, a work piece has to be scanned from several directions for the reconstruction process. Then, all acquired range views are combined to build a CAD-model of the object. The idea is that every part of the surface should be visible in at least one view. The reconstruction process is divided into the steps registration, volume sculpturing and generation of an accurate polygonal representation.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, the object might be significantly larger than the scanner is able to capture in one view. Thus, several unregistered range images showing only partial views of the object must be combined to generate a complete geometrical model [11] [4] <ref> [1] </ref> [2] [5]. With our approach, it is possible to reconstruct concave and convex objects, and even objects with holes out of a number of range images. 2 Method 2.1 The Processing Pipeline In our approach, the reconstruction process is divided into several steps (see figure 2).

Reference-contexts: The rough relative orientation between the new image and the world coordinate system is defined with at least three corresponding points between the new image and all previously integrated images. The detection of the relative orientation with this approach is described e.g. in <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.3.2 Registration by Minimizing a Distance Metric In our approach, the registration of multiple range images is considered as a minimization problem. For this reason, the range images must show partially overlapping surfaces of the object.

Reference-contexts: With our technique, the design, construction, reconstruction and redesign of work pieces build a closed loop (see figure 1). Fig. 1: Construction and reconstruction of work pieces. 1 3D-Scanners providing range images are able to scan the shape of an object from one view <ref> [6] </ref>. However, it is not possible to scan the complete object at once due to topological and geometrical limitations. First, parts of the 3D-object are occluded or may lie in shadow. Secondly, the object might be significantly larger than the scanner is able to capture in one view.
