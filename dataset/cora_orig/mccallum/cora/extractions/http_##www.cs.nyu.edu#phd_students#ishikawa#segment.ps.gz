Abstract: We propose a method for segmenting gray-value images. By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and meaningful region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries.

Reference-contexts: Related work There are a number of recent work on application of network-flow algorithms to computer vision. For binary images, Greig, Porteous, and Seheult [10, 11] provided an efficient and optimal solution. Recent work <ref> [2, 7, 12, 18] </ref> extended this result to more than two levels in different ways.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that by solving a maximum-flow problem one can obtain a minimum cut, a cut that minimizes the total cost over all cuts. (See <ref> [3] </ref> for details.) Note in this formulation we use a directed graph in contrast to other application of network-flow algorithms to computer vision. Segmentation by Grouping Junctions 5 an assignment a (1)=1, a (2)=2, a (3)=2, and a (4) = 3. Penalty edges are represented by gray arrows.

Reference-contexts: Note that, because the edges have directions, a constraint edge prevents only one of two ways to cut them. In and none is cut. 4. Implementation and Results We implemented the architecture explained in the last section. For maximum-flow algorithm we used standard push-relabel method with global relabeling <ref> [5] </ref>. Our system successfully segmented various images into only a few levels. Figure 4 shows the segmentation of the image Gear into two, three, and four gray values.

Reference-contexts: Region approaches are our main interest. Most of the work, however, is ad-hoc when predefining the number of regions or predefining values for the regions. Layers approaches have shown promises in motion segmentation (Weiss [21]), and they yield segmentation directly (Darrell and Pentland <ref> [6] </ref>). Their usual problems are to estimate the number of layers and the values associated with the layers, where ad-hoc methods or prohibitive optimization computations (e.g., reducing to EM algorithms) are employed.
