Title: Mirror-Image Round Robin Spatial Data Partitioning a Case Study With Parallel SEUS  
Author: A. A. El Haddi ; S. Shekhar S. Carroll 
Date: August 13, 1996  
Abstract: The National Weather Service interpolates snow conditions over numerous hydrologic basins to obtain snow water equivalent estimates and associated errors for gridded fields with 30 arc second resolution. Solving problems of this scale involves an enormous number of computations and data input and output operations. Using sequential implementation to obtain gridded estimates may require execution times ranging from hours to days. Thus it becomes infeasible to solve large problems of national scale interactively or in a time frame suitable for near real time forecasts and flood warnings. In this paper we discuss some techniques used to speed-up the computation by partitioning physical space into sub-domains. Spatial operations relating to each sub-domain are executed over a distributed heterogeneous memory architecture. Results from various strategies for distributing computations are discussed. A performance analysis is presented for the parallel implementation of snow estimation and updating system of the National Weather Service. A new Mirror-Image Round-Robin(MIRR) data partition technique is introduced. Many of these techniques have applications in developing high performance and distributed geographic information systems(DGIS).

Reference-contexts: Government and state agencies rely on these forecasts to prepare for flood disasters and issue early flood warnings. NWS applications use multi-source data to interpolate snow-water equivalent over large areas <ref> [HRA95, Car95] </ref>. These data are obtained by satellites, low flying aircraft, ground based sensors and sampling crews. A spatial model is used to obtain a gridded SWE over larger areas and to obtain areal snow-water equivalent estimates over a river basin.

S7: Compute Total standard deviation variance. For example, the small Animas river basin used by <ref> [CDCC95] </ref>, contained 2681 grid points, 13 ground points and 4 flight lines. The numbers of segments per flight line were 47, 62, 65 and 61 for flight lines 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The number of grid points is proportional to the basin surface size. <p> Our measurements consisted of the execution times for various modules and the values of ^oe 2 Y s k that were compared with a version of SEUS implemented in SAS version 9.07 by Steve Carroll <ref> [CDCC95] </ref>. We have estimated the communication cost T com by subtracting the computation time of oe k from the total round-trip time which included the communication and the the computation times. We computed the communication overhead, o = T com T calc .
