Abstract: We obtain new algorithms to test if a given multivariate polynomial over p-adic fields is identical to zero. We also consider zero testing of polynomials in residue rings. The results complement a series of known results about zero testing of polynomials over integers, rationals and finite fields. fl Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, and the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, California.
