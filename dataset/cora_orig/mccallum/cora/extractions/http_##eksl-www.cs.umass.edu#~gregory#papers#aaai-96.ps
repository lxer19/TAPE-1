Title: A Session with the Scientist's Empirical Assistant

Abstract: Can an artificial agent make meaningful scientific discoveries? This problem has concerned researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for three decades, but the results are inconclusive. Our approach is to provide a mixed-initiative system which supports a human scientist in common scientific activities, such as reasoning about a problem, formulating and testing hypotheses, running experiments, and keeping records of the results. The system, called the Scientist's Empirical Assistant (SEA), uses planning and heuristic reasoning to search a space of open hypotheses. The user provides knowledge about the domain and guidance for selecting the most appropriate course of action. SEA designs experiments and carries them out within an on-line laboratory, and then reasons about the results in terms of expected behavior. Here we present our first experience with the system, in the context of a real problem. This example is a representative problem from the emerging area of Empirical Algorithmics, in which scientists perform empirical studies of an algorithm in order to develop theorems about its behavior. Working with this problem provides the opportunity to consider one of the most interesting issues of scientific discovery: how a rigorous theory is constructed from empirical observations of the world.

This paper presents our first experience with the prototype SEA system, in the context of an unsolved problem from a real-world domain.

Reference-contexts: The plan library is documented on line at (address removed for blind review). 3 An Open Problem in Algorithmics SEA has been applied to a problem posed by Professor Arnold Rosenberg and Lixin Gao during their studies of parallel algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>. The problem involves task-based parallel computation on a ring of identical processors which store incoming tasks in a FIFO queue. When the processor is idle, a task is removed from the queue and executed.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents our first experience with the prototype SEA system, in the context of an unsolved problem from a real-world domain. The problem is interesting in its own right, as an example of scientific discovery in the emerging area of Empirical Algorithmics <ref> [5] </ref>, in which scientists develop theorems about the behavior of algorithms based on empirical evaluation. Because we would like SEA to develop theories through experimentation with computer programs, the domain of Empirical Algorithmics is a perfect setting.

Reference-contexts: Human scientists rarely work this way; rather, great scientific achievements are most common in collaborative environments, which introduce new perspectives and encourage cross-fertilization of ideas. Recent studies in science education indicate that a major factor in successful problem solving is the ability to formulate and follow a strategy <ref> [8] </ref>. From an AI perspective, this means scientific discovery systems will be more successful if they are capable of planning. Planning techniques restrict the portion of a search space that is explored and the context in which heuristics can be applied.

Reference-contexts: SEA relies on a planning mechanism and the user's expertise to select experiments efficiently. It uses a partial-hierarchical planner originally developed for the Assistant for Intelligent Data Exploration (AIDE) <ref> [10] </ref>. This planning environment is partial in that it interleaves planning phases with execution of the plan, and hierarchical because it establishes a hierarchy of subgoals which progress toward the final goal.
