Title: Guided Crossover: A New Operator for Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization  
Author: Khaled Rasheed Haym Hirsh 
Web: http://athos.rutgers.edu:80/ shehata/papers.html  
Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used in different domains as a means of doing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. They have a much better chance of getting to global optima than gradient based methods which usually converge to local sub optima. However, GAs have a tendency of getting only moderately close to the optima in a small number of iterations. To get very close to the optima, the GA needs a very large number of iterations. Whereas gradient based optimizers usually get very close to local optima in a relatively small number of iterations. In this paper we describe a new crossover operator which is designed to endow the GA with gradient-like abilities without actually computing any gradients and without sacrificing global optimality. The operator works by using guidance from all members of the GA population to select a direction for exploration. Empirical results in two engineering design domains and across both binary and floating point representations demonstrate that the operator can significantly improve the steady state error of the GA optimizer.

Reference-contexts: We summarize it briefly here; it is described in more detail in <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> . Figure 1 shows a diagram of a typical airplane automatically designed by our software system. The GA attempts to find a good design for a particular mission by varying the aircraft conceptual design parameters in Table 1 over a continuous range of values.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Genetic Algorithms (GAs) <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> are search algorithms that mimic the behavior of natural selection. GAs attempt to find the best solution to some problem (e.g., the maximum of a function) by generating a collection ("population") of potential solutions ("individuals") to the problem.

Reference-contexts: The GA stops when either the maximum number of evaluations has been exhausted or the population completely loses diversity and practically converges to a single point in the search space. The GA architecture also includes a screening module (SM) and a diversity maintenance module (DMM) <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> which can both be turned on or off. The SM saves time but preventing the GA from evaluating points that are close to previously encountered bad points. It uses a case based learning technique to do this.

Reference-contexts: The problem has 13 continuous domain design variables and 13 inequality constraints. Thus the space is partitioned into feasible and infeasible points. All points are evaluable. A more detailed description of this domain can be found in <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> . Similar to the aircraft design domain, experiments were done using ten random starting populations. The results are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 . Again, it is clear in this domain how much GC enhanced the performance in both GA architectures 2 .
