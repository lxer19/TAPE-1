Abstract: the Vortex Sheet Equation: Analytical Results Abstract We present an improved model for the vortex sheet equation, that combines some of the features of the models of Beale and Schaeffer, Dhanak, and Baker et al. We regularize the Beale-Schaeffer equation with a second-order viscous regularizing term, and we add a globally defined flux term in conservative form. We obtain u t + iu x = [H(u )u ] x + [ju x j 2 u x ] x + u xx , where i 2 = 1, and H(u ) is the Hilbert transform of u . We derive bounds for the solution of the equation and its first-order spatial derivatives in L 2 and in the maximum norm, independent of . We show that the function u t satisfies an L 2 norm bound that depends linearly on ; all the other derivatives satisfy bounds that depend on negative powers of . We show that, for &gt; 0, the solution exists and is unique. We also prove that, for &gt; 0, in the limit of ! 0, the sequence of functions (u ) &gt;0 has a weak limit; the weak limit may not be unique.

Reference-contexts: The continuum of model equations with globally defined flux [16], which included the two particular model equations investigated in <ref> [1] </ref> and [17], shed some light on the behavior of equations with globally defined flux, but it did not give sufficient insight to determine the precise behavior of the vortex sheet in the limit of vanishing viscosity. <p> We propose the following equation u x = [H (u )u ] x + [ju x ] x + u u (x; 0) = f (x);(2b) as an improved model equation for the vortex sheet equation. To derive the equation, we proceed as in <ref> [1] </ref>: we take Dhanak's equation fl t + (V fl) s = fl ss ;(3) where fl is the effective vortex sheet strength assigned to the curve in the center of the layer, s is the arclength along this curve, and V is the tangential component of the velocity generated by <p> Previous models considered <ref> [1] </ref>, [16], [17] did not have both features.
