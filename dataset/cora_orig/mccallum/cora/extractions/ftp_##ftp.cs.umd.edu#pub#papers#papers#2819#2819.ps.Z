Abstract: We designed, implemented, and evaluated a new concept for visualizing and searching databases utilizing direct manipulation called dynamic queries. Dynamic queries allow users to formulate queries by adjusting graphical widgets, such as sliders, and see the results immediately. By providing a graphical visualization of the database and search results, users can find trends and exceptions easily. User testing was done with eighteen undergraduate students who performed significantly faster using a dynamic queries interface compared to both a natural language system and paper printouts. The interfaces were used to explore a real-estate database and find homes meeting specific search criteria.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is difficult to specifically identify the advantages or disadvantages; however, from a usability standpoint, it does seem that the DQ interface does perform better, overall, than QA for some types of questions. This study and others <ref> (Ahlberg, Williamson, & Shneiderman, 1992) </ref> have shown dynamic queries to have several benefits over current systems: Queries can be made much faster by sliding the sliders and seeing rapid feedback directly on the display.
