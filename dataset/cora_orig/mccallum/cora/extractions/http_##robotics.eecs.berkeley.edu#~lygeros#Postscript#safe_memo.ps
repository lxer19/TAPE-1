Abstract: In this paper, we design safe and efficient hybrid controller for an Automated Highway System (AHS) architecture based on platooning. AHS is an example of a large scale, multiagent, complex dynamical system which is ideally suited for design of a hierarchical hybrid controller. The objective of an AHS design is to increase the safety and throughput of highways by full or partial automation of the traffic. In an architecture developed by researchers of the California PATH project, a full automation scheme is proposed based on the concept of platooning. Here we apply the game theoretic design techniques developed in [1] to obtain hybrid controllers that guarantee safe and efficient operation thereby eliminating the need for verification. Even though the final theorems are specialized to the platooning concept the details of the calculations are general enough to apply to any vehicle control problem.

Sastry, </author> <title> "A design framework for hierarchical, hybrid control." </title> <type> (preprint, </type> <note> submitted to Special Issue on Hybrid Systems of the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control), </note> <month> March </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: In this paper we present a possible hybrid control scheme for low level regulation of automated vehicles. Our design makes use of the techniques introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. In particular game theory is used to design continuous controllers and establish bounds on their performance. These bounds are then used as abstractions of the operation of the low level closed loop system in the design of the discrete switching scheme. <p> A design for the coordination layer is given in detail in [7]. The logical correctness of the coordination layer design was verified in [7] under simplifying assumptions on the continuous dynamics of the vehicle and the regulation layer controllers. We will apply the design methodology developed in <ref> [1] </ref> to come up with a controller for the regulation layer that can guarantee safe, comfortable and efficient operation under minimal assumptions on the coordination layer. <p> A time interval [0; T ]. 3 The design algorithm presented in <ref> [1] </ref> was also originally introduced in [33]. 9 2. A trajectory space, X with some topological structure. The elements of X , denoted fx (t); 0 t T g, are the permissible state trajectories of the game. 3. An input space, U , with some topological structure. <p> For a formalism customized to automated highway systems see [44]. A hybrid automaton, H, will be a dynamical system, with a set of states and relations that determine the transitions between them. We will follow the hybrid automaton model described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The state of a hybrid automaton is a tuple (q; x) 2 Q H fi R n H , where Q H is a finite set of discrete states and x a set of continuous state variables. <p> They state that, if the discrete design does not guarantee that x 2 V i when controller u i is applied, then there exist system trajectories that violate the closed loop requirements (in this case safety). Improving performance using coordination: In the algorithm introduced in <ref> [1] </ref> the role of inter-agent coordination is to reduce the set of allowable disturbances. This has the effect of "biasing" the game in favor of the controller and hence increasing the range of conditions under which game winning controls exist and improving the overall system performance.

Reference-contexts: The paper is arranged in nine sections. In Section 2 we give a brief overview of the AHS control problem. We highlight the concept of platooning which forms the backbone of the control architecture <ref> [2] </ref> on which our work is based. We specify the role which the work presented here plays within this concept and give an overview of related work found in the literature. We also briefly introduce the mathematical tools used in the analysis. <p> Moreover, the calculations presented here will indicate that completely autonomous operation can not provide the guarantees necessary for safe formation of platoons. The problem is therefore ideally suited for a semiautonomous agent design. Such a design was proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Each vehicle is equipped with a two layer controller. The lower layer, called the regulation layer is responsible for trajectory tracking and regulation of each agent. The higher level, called the coordination layer is responsible for the communication and cooperation between the agents. <p> Throughput maximization is a macroscopic issue, an emergent behavior of our design, and is difficult to quantify at the microscopic vehicle level considered here. In the control architecture proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>, throughput maximization is the goal of two additional levels, called the network layer and the link layer. The overall control hierarchy is shown in Figure 1. <p> The impact of these safety constraints on throughput is the topic of ongoing research. 2.3 Overview of the AHS Research Effort The possibility of automating highway traffic has attracted attention for many years. A number of solutions have been proposed for this problem, involving various degrees of automation <ref> [12, 13, 2, 14, 15] </ref>. The platooning architecture considered here was introduced in [12, 2]. Since then, considerable research has been carried out for all the levels of the hierarchical controller. <p> A number of solutions have been proposed for this problem, involving various degrees of automation [12, 13, 2, 14, 15]. The platooning architecture considered here was introduced in <ref> [12, 2] </ref>. Since then, considerable research has been carried out for all the levels of the hierarchical controller. In the link and network layers controllers have been designed based on traffic flow models [8, 9], vehicle activity models [11] and highway work models [10]. <p> After a collision between two vehicles follower operation is established. 4. Assumptions 2-8 are satisfied. 5. The AHS contains a finite number of vehicles. Then the single lane AHS is safe in the sense of Definition 3. 10 Following <ref> [2] </ref>, it is assumed that during a maneuver the joining/splitting vehicle and the vehicle being joined to/split from cooperate and therefore are both involved in the maneuver. 25 Comments: The first assumption of the theorem imposes requirements on the design of the interface between the continuous and discrete controllers. <p> Here we will assume the lane change scenario of <ref> [2] </ref>, where a vehicle is a free agent (single car platoon) both before and after the lane change. With minimal changes the same analysis can be applied to other lane change scenarios (changing from/to the end/middle of a platoon, entire platoon lane change, etc.).

Reference-contexts: Clearly any acceptable AHS design should seek a compromise between these two opposing trends. 2.1 The Platooning Concept The concept of platooning <ref> [3] </ref> offers such a compromise. Key to this concept is the observation that collisions are not dangerous (in terms of passenger injuries and hardware damage) unless there is a large velocity differential between the colliding vehicles [4].

Reference-contexts: Key to this concept is the observation that collisions are not dangerous (in terms of passenger injuries and hardware damage) unless there is a large velocity differential between the colliding vehicles <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Ideally we would like no collisions to occur on the AHS, under normal operation. Our analysis will indicate that this requirement may be too restrictive in terms of efficiency, as it does not allow platoons to join or break up. Previous studies (Hitchcock <ref> [4] </ref>) indicate that collisions with small relative velocities are not likely to result in serious damage. <p> Assumption 1 motivates the following definition: Definition 3 A safe collision between two vehicles is one where the relative velocity at impact is less than v a . An Automated Highway System where vehicles experience only safe collisions will be called a safe AHS. Motivated by the analysis of <ref> [4] </ref> we will use v a = 3ms 1 in the calculations. Producing a completely safe AHS design is likely to be impossible, as one can not exclude the occurrence of combinations of faults that may cause unsafe collisions at any moment (for examples see [48]).

Reference-contexts: In addition to safety this large spacing guarantees that disturbances are attenuated as they propagate down a long string of platoons. This property of string stability is achieved within the platoon by communicating the state information of the first vehicle to all the vehicles in the platoon <ref> [5] </ref>. In terms of capacity, platooning clearly leads to an enormous improvement. "Static" calculations [6] indicate that, with reasonable size platoons, a fourfold increase in throughput can be expected over a manual driving scheme with the same level of safety. <p> Finally, at the regulation layer, controllers based on continuous vehicle models have 7 been designed to regulate the longitudinal motion both for the platoon leaders [13, 16, 14, 17] and for the platoon followers <ref> [5, 18, 19, 20] </ref>. For lateral vehicle motion controllers have been designed both for maintaining position in a lane [21] and for changing lanes [22]. <p> Work at the physical layer on sensors [23, 24], actuators [25] and communication devices [26] has allowed researchers to investigate the performance of some of these controllers in experiments <ref> [5, 27] </ref>. The main concern in the design of most of these controllers has been safety. Here we focus on the safety issue from the point of view of the platoon leader. <p> The third has to do with the operation of the brakes and engine, which can be modeled by the throttle and brake angles acting through an integrator on some nonlinear dynamics (involving engine time constants, aerodynamic drag, etc.) <ref> [5, 25] </ref>. For our purposes the details of the nonlinear functions b A and a A are not important. <p> The design of feedback control laws for safe follower operation has received considerable attention in recent years <ref> [5, 47] </ref>. There are three problems that make the design particularly challenging. The more obvious one is regulating to the follower fixed spacing (typically 1 meter) without crashing into the preceding vehicle. <p> There are three problems that make the design particularly challenging. The more obvious one is regulating to the follower fixed spacing (typically 1 meter) without crashing into the preceding vehicle. In <ref> [5] </ref> it was shown that, in order to achieve this objective, the vehicle controller needs information about the acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Unlike the spacing and relative velocity information, preceding vehicle acceleration is not readily available through sensors and will have to be obtained through intervehicle communications. <p> Unless special care is taken during the design, a small disturbance of the platoon leader (e.g. a transient change in velocity) may get amplified as it propagates from one follower to the next, possibly resulting in collisions down the string. In <ref> [5] </ref> it was shown that, in order to avoid this "slinky effect", followers need information about the state of the platoon leader in addition to the information about the vehicle immediately ahead of them. <p> Because the accumulated delays caused by point-to-point communication increase with the 19 size of the platoon, the leader information may have to be broadcast by the leader (using a radio link for example). Finally, in <ref> [5] </ref> it was also shown that, under the information structure dictated by the previous observations, the control law will invariably result in amplification of the control effort exerted by followers further down the platoon. This fact imposes restrictions on the operation of the leader. <p> We will avoid dealing with the complications of the follower design by introducing the assumption that the follower operation is always safe (Assumption 7). The ensuing discussion will provide some justification for this assumption. For more details the reader is referred to <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.3 Design Requirements In the leader mode the problem can be viewed as a two player zero sum game, one player being the action of vehicle A and the other the disturbances (action of vehicle B and possible collisions). <p> Refer to [35] for details. Assumption 3 (Known Model) All vehicle model parameters are known. This implies that linearization by state feedback (equation 8) is feasible. Assumption 3 can be relaxed by an adaptive or robust design. Refer to <ref> [5] </ref> for design of an adaptive controller for the case of followers in a platoon. <p> Note that this assumption allows us to mostly ignore the internal dynamics of the platoon. As a consequence we will collapse the platoons for the purposes of safety and assume that they are all one vehicle long. The work of <ref> [5, 45] </ref> leads us to believe that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We are currently working on modifying the follower design to fit it in this framework and subsequently prove Assumption 7 as a theorem.

We will apply the design methodology developed in [1] to come up with a controller for the regulation layer that can guarantee safe, comfortable and efficient operation under minimal assumptions on the coordination layer. <p> A number of designs have been proposed for the roadside controller, especially for the link layer. They make use of "fluid" flow models [8, 9], the concept of highway work [10] or the concept of highway space-time [11] to model the traffic. The coordination design of <ref> [7] </ref> takes into account the demands made by the higher layers, assuming they have been filtered by a suitable interface. Summarizing, the controller presented here does not address the parsing of the requirements for increased throughput down the network, link and coordination layers. <p> In the link and network layers controllers have been designed based on traffic flow models [8, 9], vehicle activity models [11] and highway work models [10]. At the coordination layer, a controller based on finite state machine communication protocols was designed and verified in <ref> [7] </ref>. Finally, at the regulation layer, controllers based on continuous vehicle models have 7 been designed to regulate the longitudinal motion both for the platoon leaders [13, 16, 14, 17] and for the platoon followers [5, 18, 19, 20]. <p> These controllers were based on a third order, feedback linearizable model for the vehicle and were observed to perform well when simulated individually. However, when they were interfaced [29] with the coordination layer design of <ref> [7] </ref> and simulated in the SmartPath micro simulator [30] unsafe, high relative velocity collisions were observed under extreme traffic conditions. To remedy the situation, Frankel et.al. proposed leader mode controllers that explicitly incorporate safety considerations [31]. These controllers were based on a linear, second order vehicle model with actuation delay. <p> The lane change maneuver is used to move a vehicle from one lane to another. The entry and exit maneuvers can be considered as a special case of lane change maneuver that allow the vehicle to get on/off the automated highway. In <ref> [7] </ref> communication protocols were designed to implement these maneuvers. Some assumptions were made to simplify the design process: a platoon can only be engaged in one maneuver at a time 7 (in particular all maneuvers are coordinated by the leader) and only free agents can change lane, enter and exit. <p> The logical correctness of the proposed protocols (i.e. their effectiveness as transitions between the discrete states) was verified in <ref> [7] </ref> using automatic verification tools. The verification was based on simplifying assumptions about the behavior of the continuous state of the vehicles. Here we refine these assumptions and determine if and how they can be met. <p> The "one at a time" part of the second theorem assumption is already satisfied by the coordination level design of <ref> [7] </ref>. Some additions are needed to guarantee the timing constraints. Justification for the third and fourth theorem assumptions is given in Section 3.4. <p> Assumptions 2-8 are satisfied. 5. The AHS contains a finite number of vehicles. Then the multi lane AHS is safe in the sense of Definition 3. Theorem Assumption 2 is to be interpreted according to the communication protocol design of <ref> [7] </ref>. A maneuver involves at least two cooperating platoons. For a join/split both the joining/splitting platoon and the platoon being joined to/split from are involved. <p> This reduction in the disturbance has the following hybrid automata theoretic interpretation: the communication protocols designed in <ref> [7] </ref> are such that their interconnection with the hybrid automaton of Figure 4 for the joining/splitting vehicle and the vehicle being joined to/split from has the effect of disabling the transitions Coll B and Coll C. <p> Vehicle A can then join safely knowing that the deceleration of vehicle B will not exceed the promised value. The discrete steps of this extended communication protocol (request to join/split, acknowledge the request, etc.) will be the same as the steps of the protocol of <ref> [7] </ref>, but more continuous information (deceleration promises etc.) will need to be added. The calculations of Sections 6 and 7 can be used to determine the feasibility of such maneuvers (for given ranges of sensors and communication devices) and estimate its impact in terms of highway throughput.

Reference-contexts: At the coordination layer, a controller based on finite state machine communication protocols was designed and verified in [7]. Finally, at the regulation layer, controllers based on continuous vehicle models have 7 been designed to regulate the longitudinal motion both for the platoon leaders <ref> [13, 16, 14, 17] </ref> and for the platoon followers [5, 18, 19, 20]. For lateral vehicle motion controllers have been designed both for maintaining position in a lane [21] and for changing lanes [22]. <p> In particular we are concerned with safety problems that might arize by the hybrid interaction between the coordination and regulation layers. In [28], Godbole et.al. highlighted examples of such problems. The discussion in [28] was based on controllers designed in <ref> [16] </ref> for the various actions of the leader. These controllers were based on a third order, feedback linearizable model for the vehicle and were observed to perform well when simulated individually. <p> The feasibility of the approach was illustrated by determining conditions under which the safety of some of the control laws designed in <ref> [16] </ref> can be guaranteed. In [33], Lygeros et.al. introduced ideas from game theory to show that maximum deceleration by both leading and trailing vehicles is indeed a saddle solution, when the objective of the trailing vehicle is to avoid collision altogether 3 . <p> The results of [33] were based on the third order model used in <ref> [16] </ref> and made no assumptions about the relative deceleration capabilities of the vehicles. The calculations were used to determine "safe" sets of initial conditions and classify the "safe" controllers. <p> For our purposes the details of the nonlinear functions b A and a A are not important. Following the design of <ref> [16] </ref>, we will assume that feedback linearization has already been carried out, i.e. input: v A (t) = a A ( _x A ) (7) has been applied to yield: We will design controllers for the resulting linear dynamics. <p> The fixed points and the choice of P will depend on the maneuver in question. For steady state leader operation and for the split maneuver, the fixed point is: y L 2 4 0 3 5 for some v ; p &gt; 0 (refer to <ref> [16] </ref>). For the join maneuver on the other hand the fixed point is: y J 2 4 0 3 5 with P having zeros in its third row and column. <p> Other designs (e.g. the one proposed in <ref> [16] </ref>) are also acceptable. As we do not set a threshold for J 3 the choice of u fl 3 is not crucial. The requirement that u fl 3 2 U 2 (x 0 ) can be enforced a-posteriori, as will be shown in next section. <p> Such a design can be easily obtained, for example, by switching from tracking y d to tracking v H whenever x 1 (t) exceeds v H and back to tracking y d whenever the spacing becomes less than the desired x 3 &lt; y 1 d (see <ref> [16] </ref> for more details). <p> A controller needs to be designed to track the desired fixed point, y J d . Any controller that tracks this fixed point (for example <ref> [16, 31] </ref>) will suffice. Designs that try to minimize the cost function J 3 are preferable. <p> It can be shown that if the vehicles D and A follow trapezoidal acceleration trajectories (refer to <ref> [16] </ref>), then one can solve an optimal control problem to determine the maximum comfortable deceleration levels for the two vehicles such that the trajectories of vehicles A and D enter respective "safe" sets in minimum time and remain in the safe set from then on.

Reference-contexts: At the coordination layer, a controller based on finite state machine communication protocols was designed and verified in [7]. Finally, at the regulation layer, controllers based on continuous vehicle models have 7 been designed to regulate the longitudinal motion both for the platoon leaders <ref> [13, 16, 14, 17] </ref> and for the platoon followers [5, 18, 19, 20]. For lateral vehicle motion controllers have been designed both for maintaining position in a lane [21] and for changing lanes [22]. <p> Using the second order with delay model, Li et.al. were able to show that maximum deceleration by both leading and trailing vehicles is also a saddle solution when the objective of the trailing vehicle is to minimize the relative velocity at impact <ref> [17] </ref>. The calculations were based on the assumption that the deceleration capability of all vehicles is uniform. In [17] complete control schemes were designed based on these results and their performance in terms of stability and safety was proved. <p> able to show that maximum deceleration by both leading and trailing vehicles is also a saddle solution when the objective of the trailing vehicle is to minimize the relative velocity at impact <ref> [17] </ref>. The calculations were based on the assumption that the deceleration capability of all vehicles is uniform. In [17] complete control schemes were designed based on these results and their performance in terms of stability and safety was proved. In [34] the assumption that all vehicles have uniform deceleration capability was relaxed. <p> Clearly joining of a platoon can not take place under the requirement that no collision occurs. The next step therefore is to relax that requirement, in view of the fact that collisions with relative velocity smaller than v a are considered safe (see also [31] and <ref> [17] </ref>). Therefore, in the subsequent design we will consider the cost function: J 0 where: T = minft 0jx 3 (t) = 0g is the first collision time. <p> This observation is also supported by the results of <ref> [17] </ref> where, assuming a second order model with delay for vehicle A and uniform deceleration capabilities, it was shown that the saddle solution involves only minimum deceleration by both vehicles. These observations limit the conditions under which saddle trajectories that involve acceleration can be expected.

If needed, the techniques presented here can easily be used to modify the lateral design and/or obtain limits of guaranteed performance. As discussed in Section 3.2.3, designing control laws for the followers is a lot more complicated than for the leaders. <p> The interval [t i ; t f ) will typically represent the entire time it takes to move from one lane to the next (roughly 5 seconds under the current lateral laws <ref> [22] </ref>). For the purposes of safety, entry and exit from the automated highway will be treated as a simplified version of a lane change. In particular, entry will be modeled as a lane change from the on-ramp to an automated lane, with vehicles C and B missing.

Reference-contexts: For the third order vehicle model it was shown that maximum deceleration by both leading and trailing vehicles is not necessarily a saddle solution in this case; in fact the saddle solution may initially involve maximum acceleration of both the leading and the trailing vehicles. Finally, in <ref> [35] </ref>, the effect of collisions as a discrete disturbance to the system was introduced. Even though low relative velocity collisions were allowed by previous designs, their effect on the system dynamics was never investigated. <p> While this omission is insignificant in the case of two vehicles, it may lead to catastrophic results in general, as it allows the relative velocity of collisions to increase geometrically down a long string of vehicles. The work presented here is based on the results of <ref> [33, 34, 35] </ref>. The various elements are brought together and conditions on both the regulation and coordination layers are given under which safe operation of the AHS can be guaranteed. <p> We will assume v A max = 1 to simplify the analysis. Typical values of a A min , etc. can be found in <ref> [35] </ref>. 3.2.1 Control Objectives The objective is to design a controller for vehicle A. The requirements we impose on the design are safety, passenger comfort and efficiency. It is assumed that safety takes precedence over the other two requirements. Comfort will be assumed to be more important than efficiency. <p> Our analysis can be extended to a more "fault tolerant" design [49], if appropriate extensions to the definitions of safety are given [48]. Refer to <ref> [35] </ref> for details. Assumption 3 (Known Model) All vehicle model parameters are known. This implies that linearization by state feedback (equation 8) is feasible. Assumption 3 can be relaxed by an adaptive or robust design. <p> A consequence of Assumption 4 is that the leader mode controllers can utilize full state feedback (without making use of an observer). We assume that the sensor ranges are limited. The limits (see <ref> [35] </ref>) and the analysis presented here can be used to infer limitations on the AHS operation dictated by safety (e.g. limits on the speed of travel). These issues are discussed further in Section 9. 22 Assumption 5 (Elastic Collisions) Collisions are instantaneous, perfectly elastic and all vehicles have equal masses. <p> In [52], a vehicle may even use communication and the actuators of neighboring vehicles to recover actuation capabilities lost to faults (for example brake faults of platoon followers). Refer to <ref> [35] </ref> for details. 51 sensor range is smaller than the front sensor range, vehicle A in Figure 5 may be unable to detect vehicle D, but vehicle D may be able to detect vehicle A, after the middle of the maneuver.

Reference-contexts: 0 C ) := x 1 (T C ) ffiv C x 4 (T 0 C ) := x 4 (T C ) + ffiv C This model will be quite accurate if the relative velocity at impact is low, in which case the collision is more or less elastic <ref> [45] </ref>. We will assume that the relative velocity of all collisions is bounded in an interval [v a ; 0]. In hybrid system terminology the collisions are discrete disturbances. <p> These issues are discussed further in Section 9. 22 Assumption 5 (Elastic Collisions) Collisions are instantaneous, perfectly elastic and all vehicles have equal masses. This assumption is clearly unrealistic. Assuming perfectly elastic collisions is not unreasonable for low relative velocity collisions <ref> [45] </ref>. The assumption that all vehicles have equal mass can easily be relaxed. Assumption 5 leads to: Fact 1 Under Assumption 5, a collision with relative velocity at most v a induces an instantaneous change in velocity of at most v a in the colliding vehicles. <p> Note that this assumption allows us to mostly ignore the internal dynamics of the platoon. As a consequence we will collapse the platoons for the purposes of safety and assume that they are all one vehicle long. The work of <ref> [5, 45] </ref> leads us to believe that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We are currently working on modifying the follower design to fit it in this framework and subsequently prove Assumption 7 as a theorem.

Reference-contexts: The design of feedback control laws for safe follower operation has received considerable attention in recent years <ref> [5, 47] </ref>. There are three problems that make the design particularly challenging. The more obvious one is regulating to the follower fixed spacing (typically 1 meter) without crashing into the preceding vehicle.

Reference-contexts: Producing a completely safe AHS design is likely to be impossible, as one can not exclude the occurrence of combinations of faults that may cause unsafe collisions at any moment (for examples see <ref> [48] </ref>). The following assumption is therefore crucial to proving safety: Assumption 2 (Normal Mode AHS Operation) Operation on the AHS is "normal": no faults occur and the environmental conditions are benign. <p> Our analysis can be extended to a more "fault tolerant" design [49], if appropriate extensions to the definitions of safety are given <ref> [48] </ref>. Refer to [35] for details. Assumption 3 (Known Model) All vehicle model parameters are known. This implies that linearization by state feedback (equation 8) is feasible. Assumption 3 can be relaxed by an adaptive or robust design.

Reference-contexts: It will be needed as an implicit assumption in the proofs of the subsequent lemmas. Assumption 6 (Perfect Lateral Control) Lateral operation is perfect This assumption is not too unrealistic, as both simulation and experimental results indicate <ref> [50, 22] </ref>. If needed, the techniques presented here can easily be used to modify the lateral design and/or obtain limits of guaranteed performance. As discussed in Section 3.2.3, designing control laws for the followers is a lot more complicated than for the leaders.
