Abstract: The B-spline representation for divided differences is used, for the first time, to provide L p -bounds for the error in Hermite interpolation, and its derivatives, thereby simplifying and improving the results to be found in the extensive literature on the problem. These bounds are equivalent to certain Wirtinger inequalities (cf. [FMP91:p66]). The major result is the inequality jf (x) H fi f (x)j n!

Reference-contexts: For the case of equality C j n;1;1 (posfi) is equal to the lower bound in Theorem (5.2). This result, which is often quoted and used (cf. <ref> [Ag83] </ref>), was apparently mentioned in Hukuhara [Hu63]. The author has been entirely unsuccessful in locating [Tu41]. It is curious, given its significance, that none of those quoting [Tu41] whom the author was able to contact had ever seen a proof of Tumura's result.

Reference-contexts: Some history An exhaustive search of the literature shows that (3.5) is not known to those working on error estimates for Hermite interpolation. For example, see the recent, elaborate, representation for G fi given in <ref> [AW92] </ref>. Instead, the main tool used in the literature has been the following. (3.9) Beesack's inequality ([Be62]).

Reference-contexts: Apparently, see, e.g., the recent monograph of Agarwal and Wong <ref> [AW93] </ref>, B-splines are not known to the many authors in this area. <p> In some very special cases, where fi lies in fa; bg, and p; q = 1, C (j) n;p;q (posfi) has been determined by computing kAk (which is taken on for a constant function). Results along these lines can be found in Tumara [Tu41], Birkhoff and Priver [BP67], and <ref> [AW93] </ref>. There is strong circumstantial evidence that each of these is a special case of the following. (2.3) Conjecture. Let fi fl consist of one endpoint m times and the other n m times, where 2m n. <p> Once this is done, it should be possible to give a unified treatment of the many error bounds for special cases of Birkhoff interpolation, most notably, Lidstone interpolation (see [AW93:Ch.1]), Abel-Gontscharoff (see [AW93:Ch.3]), and the `miscellaneous interpolations' of Chapter 4 of <ref> [AW93] </ref>. For some simple examples of L 1 -estimates for Birkhoff interpolation see [Ho93]. Tumura's result? Of the `exceptional results' mentioned in Section 5, by far the most outstanding is Tumura's. (6.1) Tumara's Result ([Tu41]). Assume n 2.

Reference-contexts: This is seen to be the appropriate replacement for an inequality, due to Beesack <ref> [Be62] </ref>, that has been used extensively over the last 30 years. In Section 4, we use the inequality (1.1) to obtain L p -error bounds for Hermite interpolation. There is a discussion of the relevant literature, including `Wirtinger inequalities'.

Reference-contexts: In some very special cases, where fi lies in fa; bg, and p; q = 1, C (j) n;p;q (posfi) has been determined by computing kAk (which is taken on for a constant function).

There is strong circumstantial evidence that each of these is a special case of the following. (2.3) Conjecture. Let fi fl consist of one endpoint m times and the other n m times, where 2m n. <p> For q 6= 1, or j &gt; 0, the computation of kAk (and hence the determination of C n;p;q (posfi)) is in general very difficult. Some aspects of this difficulty are discussed in <ref> [BP67] </ref>. To get a feel for what is involved, consider the simplest case, namely of inter polation at one point. Suppose b a = 1, and fi = fg. <p> This estimate reproduces the results of Brink [Br72], which are for the case when p; q = 1, and, otherwise, provides bounds where none were previously known. 5. L p -bounds for the derivative of the error in Hermite interpolation With the exception of [Tu41], <ref> [BP67] </ref>, and [AW93:Th.2.4.13], all existing estimates for C n;p;q (posfi), j &gt; 0 are obtained, not by attacking D (j;0) G fi directly, but by using bounds for C n;p;q (posfi) together with Rolle's Theorem. <p> In the exceptional cases [Tu41], <ref> [BP67] </ref>, and [AW93:Th.2.4.13], there is equality in the lower bound of Theorem (5.2). This phenomenon is equivalent to there being equality in n;p;q (posfi) (b a) nj+ 1 p 1 for all f 2 n .

This question is considered in <ref> [Wa94 2 ] </ref>. The minimiser of fi 7! k! fi k p has close connections with best polynomial approxima tion, and Gauss quadrature.
