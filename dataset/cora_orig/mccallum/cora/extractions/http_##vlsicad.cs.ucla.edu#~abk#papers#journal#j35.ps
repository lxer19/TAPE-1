Reference-contexts: That zero-temperature LSMC has very few basins of attraction is also in some sense an implicit assumption of Applegate et al. <ref> [Applegate et al., 1995] </ref>, who use the union of edges in a very small number (10) of LSMC solutions to generate a good bounding solution within a branch-and-bound approach; this method has resulted in several recent "world's records" for optimal solution of large TSP instances. 4 2-changes (i.e., a type of <p> Also recall that the success of zero-temperature LSMC has led [Martin and Otto, 1996] <ref> [Applegate et al., 1995] </ref> to explicitly conjecture or implicitly assume that the LSMC cost surface (under the f kick move + Descent g neighborhood operator) has very few local minima. However, it is our experience that zero-temperature LSMC is often trapped in local minima which are not globally optimum.

Reference-contexts: Studies such as [Johnson, 1990] point to greedy local search (e.g., using the fast 3-Opt [Bentley, 1992] or the Lin-Kernighan (LK) [Lin and Kernighan, 1973] neighborhood structure) as the most effective approach for practical instances. Over the past decade, iterated descent <ref> [Baum, 1986a] </ref> [Baum, 1986b] has been shown to be an effective means of applying a given greedy local search "engine": iteratively perform a greedy descent, then perturb the resulting local minimum to obtain the starting solution for the next greedy descent. <p> Thus, in both previous studies a new local minimum is generally not accepted unless it strictly improves over the current solution. 3 It is worth noting that early work of Baum <ref> [Baum, 1986a] </ref> [Baum, 1986b] proposed an iterated descent approach that is essentially similar to the more recent LSMC strategies. <p> Using a strategy originally due to Lin and Kernighan [Lin and Kernighan, 1973], a neighbor-list stores the 25 nearest neighbors for each city; this is implemented via the k-d tree [Bentley, 1990] data structure and simplifies finding improving moves or verifying local optimality. Following the terminology of [Johnson, 1990] <ref> [Baum, 1986a] </ref> [Baum, 1986b], we call the associated LSMC implementations Iterated 2-Opt, Iterated 3-Opt and Iterated LK, respectively. As testbeds, we use three instances whose optimal tour costs are known. <p> Generally, all performance comparisons in this paper are based on the averages of solution costs over 50 trials. 6 The average running times are reported in CPU seconds on an HP-Apollo 9000/735 workstation. 2 Studies of Kick Move Strength The studies of <ref> [Baum, 1986a] </ref> [Baum, 1986b] and [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] clearly point out the effect of kick move choice on solution quality. <p> Thus, in this section we propose use of stronger perturbations which enable escape from spurious local minima. This results in a hierarchical LSMC approach, with non-zero annealing temperatures constituting a "higher-level kick move" that is applied when the LSMC search is perceived to be trapped. Baum <ref> [Baum, 1986a] </ref> [Baum, 1986b] also raised the issue of escaping spurious local minima, and proposed applying a (structurally) stronger kick move while remaining within the zero-temperature regime.

Kick move perturbation of the current local minimum tour is typically achieved using a k 0 -change, with k 0 not necessarily equal to k.

LIN318 and ATT532 are well-known geometric TSP instances used in many other studies, e.g., [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1992] [Martin and Otto, 1996] <ref> [Johnson, 1990] </ref>; the former has 318 city locations and is due to Lin and Kernighan [Lin and Kernighan, 1973], while the latter is derived from the locations of 532 cities in the continental United States. <p> Inter-city distances are maintained as double-precision reals, and tour costs are rounded to the nearest integer. 6 The exception is the Iterated LK results for instance S800; running times were such that we are able to report only the average of 2 trials. 6 <ref> [Johnson, 1990] </ref> used the double-bridge 4-change kick move. [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] allowed only kick moves that did not increase the tour length by more than some "small integer multiple" of the smallest inter-city distance 7 while [Johnson, 1990] imposed no such restrictions. <p> we are able to report only the average of 2 trials. 6 <ref> [Johnson, 1990] </ref> used the double-bridge 4-change kick move. [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] allowed only kick moves that did not increase the tour length by more than some "small integer multiple" of the smallest inter-city distance 7 while [Johnson, 1990] imposed no such restrictions. In this section, we describe studies of the relationship between kick move size (i.e., strength of the perturbation) and LSMC performance. <p> There were two exceptions to this practice: for 3-change we randomly chose among the four possible patterns that could reconnect the tour fragments, and for 4-change we used the (unrestricted) double-bridge 4-change as in <ref> [Johnson, 1990] </ref>. 7 tables show solution costs at intervals of 1000 iterations (up to 5000, 10000 and 10000 iterations for LIN318, ATT532 and S800, respectively). Tables 11, 12 and 13 show results for the same experimental protocol, using Iterated 3-Opt. <p> Tuning the values of p and I to a given instance and CPU budget M remains an open issue. 5 Conclusion We have provided extensive experimental studies of traditional zero-temperature LSMC, following the original implementations reported by [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] and <ref> [Johnson, 1990] </ref>.

Furthermore, it is a relatively small perturbation whose "non-sequential" structure <ref> [Lin and Kernighan, 1973] </ref> is not easily reproduced by the Lin-Kernighan algorithm. As can be seen from Figure 1, the LSMC method actually performs simulated annealing over local minima, with f kick move + Descent g as the neighborhood operator. <p> Our experiments use 2-Opt, 3-Opt and LK local optimization engines provided by [Boese, 1995]. These codes implement speedups of 2- and 3-Opt which are described in [Bentley, 1992] and reviewed in [Johnson and McGeoch, 1997]. Using a strategy originally due to Lin and Kernighan <ref> [Lin and Kernighan, 1973] </ref>, a neighbor-list stores the 25 nearest neighbors for each city; this is implemented via the k-d tree [Bentley, 1990] data structure and simplifies finding improving moves or verifying local optimality. <p> LIN318 and ATT532 are well-known geometric TSP instances used in many other studies, e.g., [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1992] [Martin and Otto, 1996] [Johnson, 1990]; the former has 318 city locations and is due to Lin and Kernighan <ref> [Lin and Kernighan, 1973] </ref>, while the latter is derived from the locations of 532 cities in the continental United States.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the "large-step Markov chain" (LSMC) heuristic of <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> and the "iterated LK" heuristic of [Johnson, 1990] are believed to be the best-performing iterated descent variants (and, indeed, the best-performing of all heuristics for obtaining near-optimal solutions [Johnson and McGeoch, 1997]); we generically refer to both of these as LSMC methods. 1.1 Previous Large-Step Markov <p> to be the best-performing iterated descent variants (and, indeed, the best-performing of all heuristics for obtaining near-optimal solutions [Johnson and McGeoch, 1997]); we generically refer to both of these as LSMC methods. 1.1 Previous Large-Step Markov Chain Implementations The LSMC approach is described in Figure 1, following the presentation in <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref>. LSMC alternately applies (i) a (greedy) local optimization procedure Descent, followed by (ii) a "kick move" which perturbs the current local minimum solution in order to obtain a starting solution for the next Descent application. <p> Local search (i.e., Descent) procedures used in previous implementations include LK as well as k-Opt methods. 1 <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> used both LK and a fast implementation of 3-Opt; [Johnson, 1990] used LK only. Kick move perturbation of the current local minimum tour is typically achieved using a k 0 -change, with k 0 not necessarily equal to k.

On the other hand, <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> states that the above kick move is generally unable to escape the current basin of attraction (i.e., local optimization will return to the same local minimum); the double-bridge 4-change kick move is partly motivated by this belief.

As noted above, both <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> and 5 City locations are specified by integer coordinates in the Euclidean plane. <p> are maintained as double-precision reals, and tour costs are rounded to the nearest integer. 6 The exception is the Iterated LK results for instance S800; running times were such that we are able to report only the average of 2 trials. 6 [Johnson, 1990] used the double-bridge 4-change kick move. <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> allowed only kick moves that did not increase the tour length by more than some "small integer multiple" of the smallest inter-city distance 7 while [Johnson, 1990] imposed no such restrictions. <p> In each table, "Cost" indicates the average solution cost expressed as a percentage above optimum. The 7 Efforts to contact the authors of <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> in order to determine the value of this "small integer" have been unsuccessful. 8 In other words, there may be many ways to reconnect the tour fragments in, say, a 7-change but we always reconnect the fragments in the same way. <p> Tuning the values of p and I to a given instance and CPU budget M remains an open issue. 5 Conclusion We have provided extensive experimental studies of traditional zero-temperature LSMC, following the original implementations reported by <ref> [Martin, Otto and Felten, 1991] </ref> and [Johnson, 1990].
