Abstract: Key software design principlese.g., information hiding, spiral processes, and guidelines for timing design decisionsremain idiosyncratic, ad hoc, and not unified or explained in theory. This makes them hard to teach, learn, and use in principled ways. We see the potential to build stronger foundations for software design by viewing it as an investment activity and by relating design concepts directly to well developed financial investment theories. In this paper we focus on the specific issue of the value of flexibility in the face of uncertainty. Uncertainty puts a premium on flexibility to change products and plans, but flexibility also incurs costs. The theories on which earlier approaches to software engineering economics were basedprimarily static net present valuecannot account for the value of flexibility. Real options theory, which seeks to make this value tangible in capital investment through an analogy to financial (e.g., stock) options, provides a framework within which we analyze software design concepts. We sketch our interpretation of important design principles in real options terms, making the idea precise for the specific case of optimal timing of design decisions. We discuss the validity of the approach for software; impediments to quantitative application; and how qualitative options thinking can nevertheless improve design decision making.

Reference-contexts: This paper contributes to a theoretical account of core software design principles. A central idea that software design is usefully viewed as an investment activity under uncertainty, the goal of which is to optimize value added over time. Applying investment ideas in software engineering is not new <ref> [6] </ref>. What is new in this paper is the use of more sophisticated financial engineering ideas, in general, and of theories about the value of flexibility in capital projects, in particular. We aim to outline a new economic account of flexibility-oriented software design principles. <p> However, we want to avoid generating more ad hoc and idiosyncratic explanations. We thus appeal to an established investment theory for an account of the value of flexbility under uncertainty. Appealing to finance is not a new idea. Boehm <ref> [6] </ref> pioneered applications of economics to software. What is astonishing, though, is that the value of flexibility has remained mysterious not only in software, but also in corporate finance and economics. Theoretical treatments are only now being accepted widely in the academic business community. <p> Theoretical treatments are only now being accepted widely in the academic business community. The traditional approach to valuing an asset (such as a project) in business and software engineering <ref> [6, 16] </ref> uses the static net present value (NPV) concept. The NPV of an asset is taken as the value that it adds to an enterprise. An asset is valued by estimating the discounted cash flow stream that it generates.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Thirty years after software development was named an engineering discipline, contemporary software design doctrine remains largely atheoretical. Concepts such as information hiding [36], spiral process models <ref> [8] </ref>, and the delaying of design decisions [21] remain idiosyncratic, ad hoc, and not unified or explained by serious mathematical theory. This lack denies software development full status as an engineering discipline. <p> Technical issues such as module interconnection formalisms dominate. The value added concept is not made explicit. Process criteria are largely structural, too. They define stages of design, their ordering, and transition criteria <ref> [8] </ref>. The waterfall model pays little regard to value added. The spiral model is more value-oriented in that a project get [s] started by a hypothesis that a particular operational mission (or set of missions) could be improved by a software effort [8]. <p> stages of design, their ordering, and transition criteria <ref> [8] </ref>. The waterfall model pays little regard to value added. The spiral model is more value-oriented in that a project get [s] started by a hypothesis that a particular operational mission (or set of missions) could be improved by a software effort [8]. We see this as a hypothesis that such an effort is expected to add value to the enterprise. Nevertheless, the value concept remains implicit in the formulation of the model, and no clear connection is drawn from the spiral model concept to any notion of value optimization. <p> The literature on real options in economics, management, and flexible manufacturing is well developed. 34 12.3 Software Engineering Economics The idea of finance-based decision criteria for software design is not new. Boehm wrote on it in his Software Engineering Economics <ref> [8] </ref>. He emphasized static net present value as the basic concept of value and how it can be taken as the objective of software design.

There are several theoretical formulations in finance and decision theory able to capture the value of flexibility, including dynamic net present value and extended decision analysis. They all share the ability to model dynamic optimization. <p> Real options theory has been applied to value such phased projects as compound options [19]. A striking insight emerges from the options view: it can be optimal to invest in the first phase of a project even though the overall project has a negative static NPV <ref> [9] </ref>. The key idea 32 is that spending a little on one phase can yield an option to invest in the next if conditions turn out to be favorable.

Reference-contexts: To do this, we use techniques related to option pricing. In our specific formulation, with its finite time horizon, we can compute V k for all k by a simple dynamic programming procedure <ref> [11] </ref>. First observe that V N = (S N L) + . This is clear both from formula (5) and from observing that, since the option expires at time N , there can be no advantage to waiting 13 to decide whether or not to invest.

If we could make all this money by not writing code, we'd do it <ref> [12, p.45] </ref>. Fourth, prominent managers such as Strassmann bemoan the prevalence of software design decisions that fail to focus on value added: The proper measurement of the success of software investments requires more than compliance with models of technical perfection. <p> Second, their model of the value of a system 29 is simple. It might be a reasonable model of some systems that are essentially collections of largely independent features. Some shrink-wrapped software packages have roughly this structure <ref> [12] </ref>. However, the model does not capture other systems well, in which the value of the system is not a simple sum of module values. Nor are software module implementations generated by a random walk around the current module, as reflected in the Gaussian assumption of Baldwin and Clarke. <p> The ultimate objective of design is value added. More importantly, having options concepts at hand can help us to interpret some otherwise seemingly ad hoc practices. For example, why does Microsoft use a development process that emphasizes the ability to ship a product at any time <ref> [12] </ref>? We do not know their reasoning, but an explanation in options terms is plausible. Investing to keep products shippable creates an option to ship at any time. In the face of uncertain threats of competitive entry, such an option has value.

There are several theoretical formulations in finance and decision theory able to capture the value of flexibility, including dynamic net present value and extended decision analysis. They all share the ability to model dynamic optimization. <p> The direct cost is the strike price. The opportunity cost is the lost value of the option: of the flexibility to decide whether to invest or not. It is worthwhile to exercise only when the asset value exceeds the sum of the strike price and 6 option value <ref> [13] </ref>. It can be optimal to hold rather than exercise an option, even one that's in the money. Fourth, the optimal time to exercise an option is not always obvious. Options theory is deeply concerned with optimal policies for the timing of investment decisions. <p> In the simple case of a call option on an asset that is not subject to dividend payments, a theorem states that it is optimal to wait as long as possibleuntil just before expirationto decide whether or not to invest <ref> [13] </ref>. Nothing is lost by waiting, and potentially valuable information on the asset value is obtained. However, if the asset is subject to dividends, then early exercise is sometimes justified: Holding the option forgoes the benefits of owing the asset now, i.e., of capturing those dividends. <p> In real options thinking, any sharp drop in the value of an asset can be thought of as a dividend. A competitor's entry into a market is one example. Options thinking gives a principled way to reason about how to balance countervailing incentives to hurry or delay investment decisions <ref> [13] </ref>. 5.2 From Financial Options to Real Options Real options theory was developed to address the problem in capital budgeting discussed above. Traditional capital budgeting (project) justifications use NPV-based valuations. However, NPV overlooks the value of flexibility. <p> Real options theory was thus developed precisely to address the inability of traditional capital budgeting to address strategic value. Today the options Myers saw are called growth options [24, 32]. Many other real options are now recognized. Types of real options that have been analyzed include the following <ref> [13, 48] </ref>: * defer decisions to invest until optimal to do so [13, 28, 32]; * default on a project that is structured in phases or abandon a project for its salvage value [19, 30, 33]; 7 * expand or contract production if favorable or unfavorable conditions emerge [38]; * switch <p> Today the options Myers saw are called growth options [24, 32].

Dixit and Pindyck state that, whether or not spanning holds, we can obtain a solution to the investment problem, but without spanning, the solution will be subject to an assumed discount rate <ref> [13, p. 152] </ref>. Furthermore, the discount rate is not subject to empirical justification. In essence, when markets are incomplete, the data required for the pricing based on dynamic programming will be subjective estimates of expert analysts.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Thirty years after software development was named an engineering discipline, contemporary software design doctrine remains largely atheoretical.

Reference-contexts: Technical excellence of programming code is highly desirable, but clearly insufficient. Nowadays, the most profitable and popular software in the world is notorious for its bugs and glitches. Economic utility and independent measures of customer satisfaction must be the ultimate arbiters of all judgement about the utility of software <ref> [41, p. 147] </ref>. Principles for achieving technical excellence are central to software engineering practice and research. We already have many principles for structuring products and processes to achieve technical ends. <p> Strassman then concludes that ... there is no true resemblance between trading in financial options and planning computer projects <ref> [41, p. 159] </ref>. Strassman essentially dismisses the use of real options approaches to valuing options in incomplete markets, i.e., where option prices are not in the span of the market. Strassman is both right and wrong.

There is always some definition of value for which the axiom is valid. Design can be characterized as a multiobjective optimization problem, for example, in which value is a vector measure of performance, cost and risk with Pareto-optimal solutions as acceptable outcomes. <p> To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to use contemporary investment theories to explain important software design concepts <ref> [43] </ref>.
