Abstract: Priority-based dynamic carrier allocation strategies can be classified into three categories: static-priority, dynamic-priority, and hybrid-priority strategies. Strategies based on static priorities do not consider the local carrier reuse conditions, while dynamic-priority strategies do take these conditions into consideration. Intuitively, one would expect dynamic-priority strategies to perform better than static- and hybrid-priority strategies, but in the literature it is the other way around existing dynamic-priority strategies are outperformed by some static- and hybrid-priority strategies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic-priority strategy that significantly improves over all existing strategies. Under various traffic conditions, our simulation results indicated that the proposed strategy could reduce call blocking/failure rate by a margin ranging from 15% to 95%.

Reference-contexts: The fl This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CDA-9413962. 1 problem of carrier allocation is concerned with the assignment of carriers to cells. (The reader is referred to [8] for an introduction to this topic.) Various dynamic carrier allocation (DCA) strategies (e.g., <ref> [1, 7, 9] </ref>) have been proposed for better carrier reuse. In a DCA strategy, a carrier is assigned an acquisition-priority and a release-priority in each cell. The priorities of the carriers determine the order by which the carriers will be acquired or released. <p> Depending on whether carrier reuse conditions in the neighborhood are taken into consideration in the calculation, DCA strategies can be classified into three classes: static-priority, hybrid-priority, and dynamic-priority strategies. In a static-priority strategy such as the Geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, each carrier in each cell is assigned a fixed priority that does not change over time. In a dynamic-priority strategy such as the Nanda-Goodman [7] and Locally-Optimized strategies [9], a carrier's priority is dynamically computed. <p> Intuitively, one would expect dynamic-priority strategies to outperform static/hybrid-priority strategies. But in the literature, it is not the case. The Locally-Optimized dynamic-priority strategy is known to be outperformed by the Borrowing with Directional Channel-Locking (BDCL) hybrid-priority strategy [9]; and the Nanda-Goodman dynamic-priority strategy, by the Geometric static-priority strategy <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we derive a new dynamic-priority strategy, called Two-Step dynamic-priority (TSDP) strategy, from the Nanda-Goodman strategy. <p> Since each cell has six nearest interfering cells, the worst case C=I ratio is given by [C=I] min = [(D min =R) 1] 4 =6, if a fourth-power law attenuation is assumed <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. Although the DCA strategies under study in this paper do not depend on any specific value of D min , we will assume D min = 3 3R for ease of presentation. <p> Once r 2 becomes available, a new carrier switch will again take place between r 2 and r 1 . This leads to endless switches between r 1 and r 2 . 5 3 Previous Work 3.1 Geometric Strategy In the Geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, the set of all cells is divided into k subsets G 0 ; G 1 ; : : : ; G k1 such that no two cells in the same subset have a distance less than D min , i.e., no two cells interfere with each other. <p> It is easy to verify that Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 are consistent. 4 Foundation We have reviewed three representative DCA strategies; their performances have been studied in <ref> [1, 7, 9] </ref> by simulation. Without looking at such simulation results, it is not obvious which of these strategies might outperform the others.

Without looking at such simulation results, it is not obvious which of these strategies might outperform the others. <p> In this case, there are two acquisitions of the borrowed carriers. Both the Geometric and BDCL strategies are based on the notion of optimal reuse patterns. The 9 Nanda-Goodman strategy <ref> [7] </ref>, on the other hand, ignores such a notion. It is a simple greedy method in which a cell c tries to acquire carriers that seem to have been used by many cells in c's neighborhood such that the reuse pattern of the acquired carrier is more compact than others.
