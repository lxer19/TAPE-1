Title: A Framework for Environment Aware Mobile Applications  
Author: Girish Welling and B. R. Badrinath

Abstract: In mobile computing, factors such as add-on hardware components and heterogeneous networks result in an environment of changing resource constraints. An application in such a constrained environment must react to these changes so that available resources are properly utilized. In this paper, we propose a framework to build environment aware applications. The architecture is based on an event delivery mechanism that decouples event detection from delivery, giving the flexibility and extensibility that is necessary in a mobile computing environment. Information associated with the event is delivered as part of the event notification, while delivery latency is reduced by clever thread scheduling. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by structuring an environment aware networking subsystem around a prototype implementation. The performance of this implementation is competitive with current event delivery mechanisms such as the Unix signal.

Reference-contexts: However, to our knowledge, there has been no attempt to extend the flexibility of signals. Extensions have usually been limited to adding signal support for a new condition, such as the SIGFREEZE and SIGTHAW signals described in <ref> [1] </ref>. Many object-oriented languages provide language constructs for the delivery of synchronous events. These constructs are provided primarily so that exceptional conditions that may occur during code execution can be trapped and recovered from, while preserving as much of the execution state as is possible.

Reference-contexts: With high probability, two types have the same fingerprint only if they are structurally identical. Such fingerprints have been used in systems supporting remote object method invocation <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.5 Discussion Decoupling event detection and delivery localizes mutual awareness of the participating entities in our architecture. Awareness of all channels is restricted to the Registrar. Factories and handlers depend on the name-service provided by the Registrar to obtain channel references.

Reference-contexts: Our event delivery mechanism, on the other hand, aims at providing extensible abstractions for asynchronous events. Since it cannot be determined a priori, where in the code such events actually occur, it difficult to design a general language construct for the same. 13 Upcalls in Swift <ref> [3] </ref> are suggested to aid in orga-nizing layered software around its natural flow of control. The upcall feature gives a programmer the choice of implementing an upward flow by procedure calls or asynchronous signals. This corresponds to organizing layered software into processes representing vertical or horizontal stripes, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach is also taken in the QuickLPC mechanism in Windows NT <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 Related Work An event in our architecture is an object that represents the occurrence of an asynchronous event in a system. We first compare our mechanism for event delivery with existing mechanisms in both operating systems and programming languages.

Reference-contexts: We used C++ [17] to provide the language level object support, and the capability based Mach IPC <ref> [5] </ref> to provide intertask communication. Our architecture is encapsulated within a set of C++ classes which are extended according to the needs of a particular system. In this section, we demonstrate the utility of this architecture by structuring a network aware subsystem around it (Fig 9).

Reference-contexts: For example, slow cellular or CDPD connectivity may be available outdoors, while faster wired networks, or wireless networks such as WaveLAN may be available indoors. Coping with dynamic network-related constraints such as intermittent connectivity and changing bandwidth becomes essential for a network application. While network protocols for mobile hosts <ref> [6, 11] </ref> can transparently maintain network connectivity, the changing characteristics of the link are largely ignored above the transport layer. This makes it difficult for an application to detect alternate network services (name-servers, file-servers, mail-servers, newsservers) while the mobile computer roams, or change functionality depending on the changing link characteristics. <p> Since such a module is usually activated only when a component is plugged in, the environment aware subsystem on the portable computer must be dynamically extensible so as to include this add-on software as and when it is activated. Current protocols which maintain network connectivity for mobile computers <ref> [6, 11] </ref> are partly implemented in user-space. Certain interesting conditions, such as cell hand-off, are detected in these user-space modules, making it imperative that the environment aware subsystem supports user-level detection of changes in the environment. <p> A factory is usually a software module associated with an aspect of the mobile environment, suitably augmented to produce Event Objects in our architecture. For instance, the mhmicp module in Columbia Mobile IP <ref> [6] </ref> is a prospective factory for events relating to network connectivity. When an event is detected, the factory packages information associated with it into an Event Object. This object is posted to a channel for delivery to interested environment aware applications. <p> A mobile host is equipped with both, a CDPD and a WaveLAN interface. We use a modified version of Columbia Mobile IP <ref> [6] </ref>, which is itself an extension of the Internet Protocol, to provide network packet routing to mobile hosts. The details of the changes made to Mobile IP are beyond the scope of this paper and are irrelevant for this discussion. <p> In our system, Connection Events, which represent the state of the network link, are generated in modified mhmicp and pumicp modules of Columbia Mobile IP <ref> [6] </ref>. The mhmicp module is a user level process that monitors the WaveLAN environment and manages the routing tables. The pumicp module was intended to be used for a special case in the original Columbia Mobile IP, when a mobile pop's up in an administratively foreign network.

Reference-contexts: Providing the channel abstraction as a kernel primitive will reduce the overhead of the additional context switch, making the performance comparable to signals. In this case, the delivery policy could be specified in an interpreted language using a mechanism similar to the Berkeley Packet Filter <ref> [7] </ref>. We also believe that the performance of event delivery will not degrade as much as that of a signal when the number of processes increases on a system, although we did not verify this experimentally.

Reference-contexts: While, the Reactor pattern can be considered to decouple the event handler from the event demultiplexing mechanism, the channel abstraction in our architecture can be considered to decouple an event consumer from an event producer. Certain aspects of the event delivery model in CORBA Event Services <ref> [10] </ref> are similar to our architecture. CORBA suggests the push and pull models for event delivery, where the delivery is driven by the event producer and the event consumer, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Although these constraints are becoming less noticeable, portability will always induce constraints in mobile computers, when compared to non-mobile computers. For instance, battery powered mobile computers will always face power constraints relative to their fixed counterparts. Since current technology <ref> [12] </ref> allows hardware components to be added or removed while a mobile computer is still powered on, resources related to such components may change, giving rise to dynamic constraints. <p> Two important factors that contribute towards these changes are (i) portable computer technology, and (ii) wireless communication characteristics. The principal aspect of current technology that affects the mobile environment is plug-in PC-card technology <ref> [12] </ref>. The contribution of such plug-in hardware components to the mobile environment is usually detected within add-on software modules such as load-able device-drivers.

Reference-contexts: By separating the two ends of event delivery, our event delivery mechanism allows a flexible architecture where participating entities do not depend on the existence of others. The Reactor pattern in ACE (Asynchronous Communication Environment) <ref> [15] </ref> simplifies the structuring of event-driven applications by integrating the de-multiplexing of events and the dispatching of the corresponding handlers. The mechanism is provided so that application-specific event handlers can evolve independently of the event demultiplexing mechanism provided by the operating system (eg. select () in Unix).

An initiating process sends SIGUSR1 to a previously blocked target process, immediately followed by SIGCONT. The target process, which had blocked itself using SIGTSTP, therefore returns from a kill system call and processes the SIGUSR1 signal.
