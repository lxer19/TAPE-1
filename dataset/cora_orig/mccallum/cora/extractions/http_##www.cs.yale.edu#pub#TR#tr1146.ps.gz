Reference-contexts: Against this background, in several independent works [8, 13, 14, 26] a new active contour model was proposed which unified the curve evolution approaches with the classical energy minimization methods <ref> [12, 29, 5] </ref>. The technique is motivated by the Euclidean curve shortening equation which defines the gradient direction in which the Euclidean perimeter is shrinking as fast as possible.

Reference-contexts: This type of technique was introduced into shape modelling by Casselles et al. <ref> [7] </ref> and Malladi et al. [19], via the addition of a multiplicative image gradient stopping term. This has led to powerful new techniques for edge capturing. <p> Whereas the above method motivates the use of a curvature term in shape modelling, the flow can be unacceptably slow to converge in practice. Therefore, the authors of [8, 13, 14, 26] follow <ref> [7, 19] </ref> by adding a constant inflation term to keep the curve moving in the desired direction. Our main contribution in this paper is the modification of this hyperbolic term with one derived from minimizing a certain weighted area energy functional. <p> We begin with a brief review of earlier work in the area. Caselles et al. <ref> [7] </ref> and Malladi et al. [19] proposed an active contour model based on the following level set formulation: t = (x; y) div r ! ! Here the potential (x; y) is constructed to have local minima at edges so that the evolving curve stops at them. <p> For example, in <ref> [7, 19] </ref> (x; y) takes the form: = 1+ krG fl Ik n (16) where I is the grey-scale image and G is a Gaussian smoothing filter. <p> Nevertheless, the flow suffers from the practical limitation that the simulation can be extremely slow to converge. As a remedy, the authors of [8, 26, 13, 14] follow <ref> [7, 19] </ref> by adding a constant (hyperbolic) term to keep the curve moving in the desired direction. The calculation of Section 2 1 In fact due to the doublet the front will pass back and forth across the edge, but will not stray from it. <p> Since is a globally defined function which depends on the given image, the -area part indeed defines a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Notice by equation (12) that this -area minimizing component provides the constant inflationary term (with - = 1) used in the earlier approaches to shape modelling <ref> [7, 19, 28, 8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, as well as a second doublet term which provides an additional attraction force when the front is in the vicinity of an edge. <p> Remark. The equations considered in the text are special cases of a nonlinear diffusion equation of the form: t = (x)a ij (r)@ ij + H (x; r); x = (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ): (23) As in <ref> [3, 7, 13] </ref>, under mild hypotheses obeyed by our contour models, one may show that Theorem 1 There is a unique viscosity solution of (23) in L 1 (0; T ; W 1;1 (R n )). 6 Examples An important consideration for the numerical simulation of shape modelling flows is that

Reference-contexts: Along these lines, Tek and Kimia [28] have further suggested a reaction-diffusion space of bubbles, where in place of a single contour, a number of bubbles are simultaneously placed and grown from homogeneous regions of the image. Against this background, in several independent works <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref> a new active contour model was proposed which unified the curve evolution approaches with the classical energy minimization methods [12, 29, 5]. <p> Whereas the above method motivates the use of a curvature term in shape modelling, the flow can be unacceptably slow to converge in practice.

Our main contribution in this paper is the modification of this hyperbolic term with one derived from minimizing a certain weighted area energy functional. <p> The derived flow turns out to have two components, one which is constant and one which depends on the conformal factor as well as the evolving curve. When combined with the weighted length minimizing flow derived in <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, we obtain a partial differential equation whose parabolic and hyperbolic components each have consistent interpretations as gradient flows. <p> The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the relationship between the two components of the reaction-diffusion model and gradient flows, present the evolution equation of the weighted length minimizing flow derived in <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, and then introduce and derive the weighted area minimizing gradient flow. <p> This fact is the basis for the nonlinear geometric scale-spaces studied recently in [2, 1, 16, 18]. 2.2 Weighted Length Gradient Flows In the recent papers <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, the standard Euclidean metric ds 2 = dx 2 +dy 2 of the underlying space over which the evolution takes place is modified to a conformal metric ds 2 = 2 (dx 2 + dy 2 ). <p> If the area functional is modified by a stopping term, and the minimizing flow is computed again in this affine invariant sense, one gets an affine invariant snake model based on 1=3 ; [20]. This is the affine analogue of the work in <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>. <p> It is important to note that in the above methods, the Euclidean curve shortening part of the evolution equation is the gradient flow for shrinking the perimeter of the curve as fast possible; Section 2. As explained earlier, in <ref> [8, 26, 13, 14] </ref> this model is revised and given theoretical justification by replacing the Euclidean metric ds 2 = dx 2 + dy 2 with the conformal metric ds 2 = 2 (dx 2 + dy 2 ) and deriving the associated -length gradient flow. <p> Nevertheless, the flow suffers from the practical limitation that the simulation can be extremely slow to converge.

However, in our experience with comparative simulations between this last technique and our combined -length and -area minimizing flow, we have found that the latter offers at least two advantages. <p> Observe that for each image the front converges on the desired boundary. We should note that when run with the same parameters (t, and the weights for the parabolic and hyperbolic components), the flow of <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref> produces comparable results.

Reference-contexts: This type of technique was introduced into shape modelling by Casselles et al. [7] and Malladi et al. <ref> [19] </ref>, via the addition of a multiplicative image gradient stopping term. This has led to powerful new techniques for edge capturing. <p> Whereas the above method motivates the use of a curvature term in shape modelling, the flow can be unacceptably slow to converge in practice. Therefore, the authors of [8, 13, 14, 26] follow <ref> [7, 19] </ref> by adding a constant inflation term to keep the curve moving in the desired direction. Our main contribution in this paper is the modification of this hyperbolic term with one derived from minimizing a certain weighted area energy functional. <p> We begin with a brief review of earlier work in the area. Caselles et al. [7] and Malladi et al. <ref> [19] </ref> proposed an active contour model based on the following level set formulation: t = (x; y) div r ! ! Here the potential (x; y) is constructed to have local minima at edges so that the evolving curve stops at them. <p> For example, in <ref> [7, 19] </ref> (x; y) takes the form: = 1+ krG fl Ik n (16) where I is the grey-scale image and G is a Gaussian smoothing filter. <p> Nevertheless, the flow suffers from the practical limitation that the simulation can be extremely slow to converge. As a remedy, the authors of [8, 26, 13, 14] follow <ref> [7, 19] </ref> by adding a constant (hyperbolic) term to keep the curve moving in the desired direction. The calculation of Section 2 1 In fact due to the doublet the front will pass back and forth across the edge, but will not stray from it. <p> Since is a globally defined function which depends on the given image, the -area part indeed defines a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Notice by equation (12) that this -area minimizing component provides the constant inflationary term (with - = 1) used in the earlier approaches to shape modelling <ref> [7, 19, 28, 8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, as well as a second doublet term which provides an additional attraction force when the front is in the vicinity of an edge. <p> In order to extend this influence to other level sets we use the narrow band technique of <ref> [19] </ref>. We compute the diffusive -length minimizing component using central differences and the hyperbolic -area minimizing one using upwind schemes.

In Section 2 we review the relationship between the two components of the reaction-diffusion model and gradient flows, present the evolution equation of the weighted length minimizing flow derived in <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, and then introduce and derive the weighted area minimizing gradient flow. <p> This fact is the basis for the nonlinear geometric scale-spaces studied recently in [2, 1, 16, 18]. 2.2 Weighted Length Gradient Flows In the recent papers <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref>, the standard Euclidean metric ds 2 = dx 2 +dy 2 of the underlying space over which the evolution takes place is modified to a conformal metric ds 2 = 2 (dx 2 + dy 2 ). <p> If the area functional is modified by a stopping term, and the minimizing flow is computed again in this affine invariant sense, one gets an affine invariant snake model based on 1=3 ; [20].

As explained earlier, in <ref> [8, 26, 13, 14] </ref> this model is revised and given theoretical justification by replacing the Euclidean metric ds 2 = dx 2 + dy 2 with the conformal metric ds 2 = 2 (dx 2 + dy 2 ) and deriving the associated -length gradient flow. <p> Nevertheless, the flow suffers from the practical limitation that the simulation can be extremely slow to converge.

However, in our experience with comparative simulations between this last technique and our combined -length and -area minimizing flow, we have found that the latter offers at least two advantages. <p> Observe that for each image the front converges on the desired boundary. We should note that when run with the same parameters (t, and the weights for the parabolic and hyperbolic components), the flow of <ref> [8, 13, 14, 26] </ref> produces comparable results.

Experiments must still be run to study the efficacy of the new flow for volumetric imagery.
