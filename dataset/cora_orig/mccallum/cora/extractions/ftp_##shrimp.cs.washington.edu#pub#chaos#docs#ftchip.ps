Abstract: As interconnection networks grow larger and larger, the need for reliable message delivery in the presence of faults grows as well. Unfortunately, most network routing schemes currently in use do not provide graceful tolerance of even the most common faults. Because routing messages around failed components requires non-minimal routing, it makes sense to examine routers which, by design, allow packets to take non-minimal routes. Such routers provide a basic level of fault-tolerance by allowing messages to be routed around faults, without requiring a priori knowledge of their locations. However, the mechanisms can be slow and clumsy at times. We augment Chaotic routing, a non-minimal adaptive routing scheme, with a limited amount of hardware to support fault detection, identification, and reconfiguration so that the network can automatically reconfigure itself when faults occur. We present a high-level design of these mechanisms, driven by the goal of achieving reasonable reliability without exorbitant cost.

Reference-contexts: Because of these constraints, the goal of building a fault-tolerant network router has been difficult to achieve. Non-minimal adaptive routing has shown promise for providing simple, on line mechanisms for fault avoidance <ref> [15, 2] </ref>. However, the fault-tolerance provided by such systems is not entirely robust, and can benefit from supplemental hardware that targets fault-tolerance capabilities. We present hardware and software mechanisms which boost the ability of the Chaos router to avoid faults. <p> For these reasons, the Chaos router utilizes a global, synchronous procedure for fault diagnosis. The overall network fault tolerance is accomplished mainly in system software, which orchestrates fault detection, identification, and recovery at the system level when hardware detects possible faults <ref> [2] </ref>. The initial fault detection, identification and reconfiguration is performed under the control of the local processor. Diagnostic test procedures result in the generation by each processor of a map defining its local network links as usable or unusable.

Reference-contexts: Although such routers can be made very fast due to their simplicity, they are not robust in the presence of faults because there is no natural mechanism for avoiding faulty components. Minimal adaptive routers <ref> [4, 6, 16, 12] </ref>, in which message routing has some degree of adaptivity to congestion or faults, have appeared more re-cently in research. Two difficulties with these schemes are that the prevention of deadlock becomes complicated and the adaptivity of message routing is limited. <p> Two difficulties with these schemes are that the prevention of deadlock becomes complicated and the adaptivity of message routing is limited. Recent extensions of minimal adaptive routers have added fault-tolerant capabilities, once again with the cost of added complexity <ref> [4] </ref>. Most non-minimal adaptive routers (except deflection routers) have a very natural method of fault-tolerance: faulty links appear the same as congestion, and these routers always steer messages away from congestion by derouting messages away from busy links [15, 14, 5].
