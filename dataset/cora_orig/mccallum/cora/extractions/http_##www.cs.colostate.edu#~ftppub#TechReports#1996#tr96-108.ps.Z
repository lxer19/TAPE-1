Reference-contexts: Due to mechanical vibrations and torsions, day-to-day variations of several pixels can be expected. Our coregistration takes these inaccuracies in the sensor registration into account, applying corrections to the intersensor translation. The least-squares algorithm developed in [7] and extended in <ref> [1] </ref> utilizes an iterative non-linear optimization method. Such algorithms require an initial parameter estimate. The fidelity of this initial pose+registration estimate partially determines whether the coregistration algorithm will converge to the correct minimum on the error surface. <p> If this was not done, the selection would be biased towards the LADAR data (which accounts for over 95% of the correspondences s 2 S), and the CCD portion of the error would often be ill-conditioned. For the coregistration algorithm, we used weighting factors as described in <ref> [1] </ref> which simply replace the w mc and w cl of [7] with 3 intuitive factors. First is a weighting term (ff) for controlling the relative importance of the sensors. Since we lack knowledge about the importance of these, we set ff = 0:5.

Reference-contexts: The previous work, however, could not be demonstrated in a real ATR domain, due to the unavailability of automatically extracted model and data features and the inability to generate outlier-free correspondences. As a consequence of work done in <ref> [8, 3] </ref>, we are now able to extract model and data features on real ATR images. In this paper, we have constructed outlier-free correspondences using median filtering. Using the real ATR image features and median filtering coregistration, we have constructed outlier-free correspondences.

Reference-contexts: If outliers were introduced into the correspondence set, we found convergence to neighboring minima, with large rotational errors. Some statistical methods have been proposed in the traditional literature and have been utilized by vision researchers to construct outlier-free correspondence sets. Kumar <ref> [4] </ref> utilized median filtering to evaluate his 3-D full perspective pose recovery system and here we will adapt it to coregistration. 3 Median Filtering Least-squares methods, such as our E fit measure, assume that the data has Gaussian random noise added to it. <p> The subsets need to be at least large enough to cover the degrees of freedom, so we would need to select at least 3 optical lines and 1 range point. However, Kumar <ref> [4] </ref> found that selecting a minimal number of features caused the solution to be sensitive to the Gaussian noise that we assume is overlaid onto the true data. As a consequence, it is better to select a larger subset to stablize the optimal pose against noise.

Reference-contexts: The white features in Figures 1e and 2e show both silhouette and image features determined not to be outliers: black indicates outliers. The image features are found using a model-driven approach described elsewhere in these proceedings <ref> [5] </ref>. The rightmost column shows the range data. Black squares are model range points, grey squares are LADAR pixels. Filled squares are determined not to be outliers. The overall global change between initial and final coregistration estimates in Figures 1 and 2 is small.

Reference-contexts: If, however, the correspondence data contains outliers, our method will be thrown off. Median filtering is a robust statistic for detecting and removing outliers. Median filtering <ref> [6] </ref> handles outliers by fitting to the subset of the data which minimizes the ensemble median error value. It is a robust statistic when there are less than 50% outliers.

Reference-contexts: Our formulation considers not only the relative pose between the model and the sensor suite, but also the constrained intersensor registration. A least-mean-square-error algorithm has been developed for simultaneous estimation of both pose and registration (pose+registration) <ref> [7] </ref>. As a shorthand, the term coregistration is used to describe this process. Our coregistration algorithm takes as input a set of correspondences between model features (points and lines) and an initial coregistration estimate. <p> S.

Our long term goal is an extension of this work to mulitsen-sor matching using the fitting procedure defined in <ref> [7] </ref>. However, our current reliance upon ungrouped points to represent range leads quickly to search spaces of intractable size. One solution is to perform some grouping on the range data, and work on this has begun. Another is to consider a more conventional approach to outlier removal: median filtering. <p> Another is to consider a more conventional approach to outlier removal: median filtering. This paper presents a least-median-squared-error extension of our previous coregistration work and demonstrates the algorithm on real ATR data. 2 Background In our past work <ref> [7] </ref>, we presented a coregistration recovery algorithm. We hypothesized that utilizing constraints between the sensors allowed for a more accurate pose estimate to be computed. We also noted that data in some multimodal domains, including ATR, tends not to be boresighted. <p> Due to mechanical vibrations and torsions, day-to-day variations of several pixels can be expected. Our coregistration takes these inaccuracies in the sensor registration into account, applying corrections to the intersensor translation. The least-squares algorithm developed in <ref> [7] </ref> and extended in [1] utilizes an iterative non-linear optimization method. Such algorithms require an initial parameter estimate. The fidelity of this initial pose+registration estimate partially determines whether the coregistration algorithm will converge to the correct minimum on the error surface. <p> Such algorithms require an initial parameter estimate. The fidelity of this initial pose+registration estimate partially determines whether the coregistration algorithm will converge to the correct minimum on the error surface. To investigate this problem, two sets of experiments were conducted and reported in <ref> [7] </ref>. These experiments tested the recovery of pose+registration parameters given a poor initial estimate using perfect synthetic data. It was found that the algorithm could recover, with high probability, from initial estimates up to 45 ffi and 100 meters off. <p> For the coregistration algorithm, we used weighting factors as described in [1] which simply replace the w mc and w cl of <ref> [7] </ref> with 3 intuitive factors. First is a weighting term (ff) for controlling the relative importance of the sensors. Since we lack knowledge about the importance of these, we set ff = 0:5. <p> We have already introduced one such method for simultaneously recovering the pose+registration parameters in <ref> [7] </ref>. The previous work, however, could not be demonstrated in a real ATR domain, due to the unavailability of automatically extracted model and data features and the inability to generate outlier-free correspondences.
