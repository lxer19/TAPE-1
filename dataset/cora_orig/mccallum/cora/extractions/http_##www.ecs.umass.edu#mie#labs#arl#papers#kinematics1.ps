Abstract: The objective of this work is twofold: firstly, to present the potential of CAD-based techniques with respect to implementing a user-friendly tool for systematic and efficient kinematic modeling and analysis of general assembly products, and secondly, to detail the significance of this approach for the development of a Robotic Assembly Language Planning Hierarchy (RALPH), a task-level automatic robot programming system. With the Product Assembly Modeler (PAM) as the environment for kinematic modeling, the geometric and topological information in the system's database is utilized to derive and solve

Reference-contexts: Despite the progress that has been made, it is felt that in terms of establishing a systematic approach, Computer Aided Kinematics has lagged behind compared to the developments in fields such as Finite Element Analysis or Electronic Circuit Analysis <ref> [1] </ref>. Particularly the task of modeling mechanical systems, i.e. the translation of the significant physical characteristics of a mechanism in a valid computer-suited mathematical model, is often based on "clever formulations" and intuition.

Reference-contexts: This approach, named concurrent engineering, is based on the insight that up to 80% of a product's cost is already committed in the early stages of design. A design that ignores manufacturing constraints causes avoidable expenses and delays <ref> [2] </ref>. Today, CAD is recognized for its potential to close the gap between design and manufacturing. While CAD systems have been appropriate tools for modeling single components, they have provided little support for assembly modeling.

Reference-contexts: Kinematic modeling and solving play a very important role in design and manufacturing systems <ref> [3] </ref>, e.g., fixture reconfiguration planning citebausch and robotic grasp planning [5]. In this paper, a CAD-based kinematic modeling system is proposed which associates the kinematic modeling with assembly modeling processes.

Reference-contexts: The development of a Product Assembly Modeler (PAM) in the Automation and Robotics Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst was motivated by this deficit and the insight that there is a great potential for CAD to capture designers' intents for a product <ref> [11] </ref>. An object's form is insuffient information for reasoning about its interrelations with other objects. Therefore, PAM infers function from the features of an object by allowing the user to associate process information to the part description.

Reference-contexts: Our research has resulted in an extended set of spatial relationships, including: against, parallel-offset, parax-offset, aligned, incline-offset, and include-angle (see Figure 2). Degrees of freedom of each spatial relationship is represented in terms of symmetry group and geometrical degrees set of virtual-coordinate frame <ref> [21, 22] </ref>. Design with spatial relationships is ideally suited to support modeling and analysis not only of structural assemblies, but also of assemblies that contain moving parts. Each spatial relationship can be interpreted as a constraint on the degrees of freedom of a pair of mating components.

Displacement analysis, i.e. the study of the link configurations in response to a specified driving motion, is carried out using the same method as for the determination of the initial assembly configuration.
