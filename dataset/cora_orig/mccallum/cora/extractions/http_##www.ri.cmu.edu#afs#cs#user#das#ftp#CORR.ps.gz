Abstract: Imaging, sensing and computing technologies which are being introduced to aid in the planning and execution of surgical procedures are providing orthopaedic surgeons with a powerful new set of tools for improving clinical accuracy, reliability, and patient outcomes while reducing costs and operating times. Current computer-assisted surgical systems typically include a measurement process for collecting patient-specific medical data, a decision making process for generating a surgical plan, a registration process for aligning the surgical plan to the patient, and an action process for accurately achieving the goals specified in the plan. This paper outlines some of the key concepts in computer-assisted surgery with a focus on the basic framework and underlying technologies. In addition, technical challenges and future trends in the field are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Researchers have recently demonstrated CAOS systems which use fluoroscopic C-arm images as the basis for constructing surgical plans <ref> [7] </ref>. While C-arm images do not provide as much information as CT or MR images, this approach has significant advantages in terms cost, radiation exposure, and time. <p> Intra-operative planners require computer user interfaces which allow the surgeon to perform relatively complex 3-D visualization and manipulation tasks while they are scrubbed in to a procedure. Examples of intra-operative CAOS planning systems include a fluoroscopy-based system for distal locking of intra-medullary nails in femur fractures <ref> [7] </ref>, and a fluoroscopy and robotic-based system for revisions in total-hip replacement [2].

New procedures which are on the horizon include treatment of orthopaedic trauma with multiple bone fragments, optimal correction of scoliosis, optimal placement of prostheses in hip and knee replacements, and the ability to perform minimally invasive procedures such as percutaneous spine fusion.

In the area of intra-operative sensing, the current trends are towards miniaturization, automation, and improved accuracy, robustness, and ergonomics. Current intra-operative position trackers tend to be fairly large devices which are positioned near or above the operating room table.

Reference-contexts: Research is currently in progress at many institutions in an attempt to address these limitations and improve the resulting accuracy and reliability of registration. A summary of this work is presented in Section 5.2, and an excellent overview of registration issues in general can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. In addition to merging the coordinate systems of patient-specific images with the patient, it is also necessary merge the coordinate systems of intra-operative sensors with images and other data. This process of tool calibration, is usually performed prior to the start of a surgical procedure.

Reference-contexts: The most successful use of a robotic manipulator in an orthopaedic application is Robodoc, a system for precise preparation of the femoral canal in total hip replacement surgery <ref> [14] </ref>. This system uses a pre-operative plan built from CT images to instruct the robot where to remove bone within a patients femoral canal using a high-speed pneumatic cutter.

Reference-contexts: In the area of robotic manipulators, it is likely that the next generation of surgical robots will incorporate force sensors which allow the robot to respond to contact forces in a controlled manner. The concept of semi-active robots is also being explored <ref> [15] </ref>. A semi-active robot is one which has no 15 actuation motors, and therefore cannot directly apply forces to the patient. Rather, such robots provide support for a surgical tool and constrain the motions of the surgeon controlling the tool to lie within a previously specified 3-D region.
