Abstract: Two-way authentication methods are inefficient when used to authenticate multiple users who wish to communicate securely with each other. M-way, also called conference authentication, is designed to efficiently authenticate many users and distribute a secure common conference key. Unfortunately, few if any conference authentication schemes have been developed and/or performance tested in a real distributed system. This report attempts to rectify this problem. Specifically, it presents the performance of both a star and a ring-based conference authentication scheme that has been developed for the RHODOS distributed operating system. As with most systems, RHODOS does not have any special hardware, thus, a software based solution is utilised. This report also attempts to shed some light upon how viable and secure a conference authentication scheme would be when used in a distributed system.

Reference-contexts: Both the ring and mesh formations are fully secure, but both use more messages than the star formation. However, in order to improve security in RHODOS, a version of ICKDS using a ring formation was chosen to be implemented <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. The ring formation was selected because it needs less messages than the mesh to still achieve full security. In RHODOS [3, 8] each workstation has a local Authentication Server Agent (ASA). <p> By extending this service ring-based conference authentication was possible. Thus, an extended set of parameters were created to implement both the star-based authentication tasks and to implement ring-based conference authentication. Thus, the parameters generated include both star and ring based cryptographic parameters <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1 Cryptographic Parameters The set of parameters that the CAS generated were: P, Q and R are large primes. N = P Q. g is a primitive element over GF (P), GF (Q) and GF (R).

A recent posting on the internet by Arjen Lenstra [7] told of his success in breaking down a 158 digit decimal number (2 523 -1). This number was broken down into its two component primes, of 69 and 90 decimal digits.

This number was broken down into its two component primes, of 69 and 90 decimal digits. Lenstra performed this by using some advanced hardware (two massively parallel machines [7], in conjunction with a workstation) to compute the entire factorisation in less than a month real time. This means that even a 512 bit prime cannot be considered fully secure if it is used for a month or more.

Reference-contexts: Lenstra 1 . A number of other packages were looked at (GNUs mp, DEC Frances BigNum, Pari, Mathematica, Cayley and Maple) but either they did not have the required features or were not convenient or suitable for our use <ref> [9] </ref>. The calculation times did vary for the various packages. Unfortunately a performance study of these packages was not undertaken. This means that the times generated here might decrease (or increase) if a different mathematics package is used. The test was performed on a SPARCstation ELC.
