Abstract: In this paper we focus on RSVP-based resource reservations in a heterogeneous environment which includes ATM networks. We describe a method for establishing shortcuts for the data flow through an ATM network which avoids the performance penalty associated with layer 3 processing in the classical IP over ATM approach. For the guaranteed and controlled-load types of services we show how to map the RSVP flow characteristics to ATM call parameters, and thus enable end-to-end quality of service. Finally, we discuss some concerns which have been raised regarding the use of RSVP in establishing shortcuts.

Reference-contexts: For the Guaranteed and Controlled-Load Service specifications [16, 17], of the Integrated Services framework, we show how to map RSVP flow characteristics to ATM call parameters. Additional details can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The area of ATM technology and its role in the Integrated Services framework of the IETF has been the focus of numerous recent contributions.

RSVP messages follow the IP route AEF GB. Thus, a P ath message will travel downstream from A to B, while the corresponding Resv message will travel upstream from B to A. <p> We then consider the interplay between RSVP `soft' state and ATM `hard' state in a discussion on handling failures and route changes. We refer the reader to <ref> [2] </ref> for a treatment of the general case of multiple-sender multicasts in a discussion on handling RSVP filters. 3.1 Classical RSVP support We extend the classical RSVP support of Section 2.1 to single-sender multicast flows. <p> It should be pointed out that the above expressions need to be adjusted to reflect the impact of the ATM segmentation in fixed size cells. We analyze these adjustments in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.2 Mapping of Controlled Load Service Specifications The Controlled Service can be mapped to the Available Bit Rate service of ATM [15] in the case of unicast flows. <p> In the rest of this section, we review alternatives to address this problem. We study the problem of resource reallocation following a change in flow or service specification in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.3.1 Unicast flows The case of a unicast flow is illustrated in Figure 2. When P ath arrives at A, the fields C tot and D tot contain the values P A P A S D i . <p> The details of obtaining information through ATM connection negotiation is dependent on the ATM Forum UNI and PNNI specifications under development. We present a possible approach in <ref> [2] </ref>. One feature common to the solutions above is that the advertised value is likely to be rather inaccurate, which can greatly increase the rejection rate of connections having to traverse ATM networks. <p> While attempting to provide solutions which apply equally to signaling in the UNI 3.1 environment, as well as the UNI 4.0 environment, we found that different solutions are required in order to account for significant differences between the two signaling protocols. Additional details may be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. A number of issues have been raised regarding the approach used here [14]. It has been pointed out that establishing shortcuts via RSVP, and using these shortcuts for multicast traffic, may result in receivers receiving duplicate packets.

Reference-contexts: This would also be the case if all hosts were served by a single Route Server in the Multiprotocol over ATM (MPOA) model <ref> [6] </ref>. For the multi-hop case, while RSVP messages travel over best-effort VCs, data packets flow over QoS VCs and enjoy QoS support in the routers. Traversing the routers, however, entails IP-level processing and thus is less desirable than a shortcut VC from A to B.

Reference-contexts: For applications that require performance guarantees the reservation of network resources is carried out using RSVP [5] as the reservation setup protocol. The operation of RSVP over an ATM network is the focus of our paper. Our starting point is the classical IP over ATM model <ref> [10] </ref> in which an ATMARP server is used for address resolution within a Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS), while the inter-LIS traffic is routed through IP routers. For an application with QoS requirements the classical IP over ATM architecture does allow for QoS support over the VCs between the routers.

Reference-contexts: This decision would be based on the ATM connectivity between the current router, the upstream router, and the downstream router as determined by the logical ATM network in which they reside (the concept of the logical ATM network is similar to the one described in the NHRP document <ref> [11] </ref>.) If the current router is not an egress router, it forwards the P ath message to the downstream router without updating the PHOP address field. This router does not create any P ath state for the session. If the current router is an egress router (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Another VC will be set up later from A to E. The previous description concerns initial P ath and Resv messages which trigger the reservation setup. P ath refresh messages are also forwarded along the IP route, in order to track route changes. Milliken <ref> [12] </ref> suggests that Resv refreshes are not needed, since the RSVP `soft' state has been replaced in the ATM environment by a `hard' state. Following [12], non-refresh Resv messages will be sent only if the QoS parameters of the flow change. 3.2 Root-initiated ATM shortcuts We extend the unicast scheme of <p> P ath refresh messages are also forwarded along the IP route, in order to track route changes.

Reference-contexts: We describe below a method to establish such shortcuts over ATM networks, first for unicast and then multicast application flows. In order to enable end-to-end performance guarantees we study the interplay between establishing RSVP flows and setting up ATM calls. For the Guaranteed and Controlled-Load Service specifications <ref> [16, 17] </ref>, of the Integrated Services framework, we show how to map RSVP flow characteristics to ATM call parameters. Additional details can be found in [2]. The area of ATM technology and its role in the Integrated Services framework of the IETF has been the focus of numerous recent contributions. <p> If we assume a perfect fluid model for both the IP flow and the ATM call and ignore the potential impact of the granularity of the ATM cell size and of the segmentation overhead, the following relations can be established <ref> [16] </ref>: SCR = 48 b ; PCR = 48 where 48 is the number of user data bytes per ATM cell, and P corresponds to the minimum of the speed of the incoming link and the peak rate p of the flow. <p> Note that such a mapping could also be used for unicast flows if desired. 4.3 Mapping of Guaranteed Service Specifications In the IP Guaranteed Service model <ref> [16] </ref>, a maximum delay ~ d is guaranteed to a flow by reserving a minimum buffer clearing rate R such that ~ d = R R pr r R &lt; p (2) where C tot = P D P D S D i are values accumulated by P ath on its <p> Second, the form of the delay guarantees specified in <ref> [16] </ref>, i.e., based on the specification of a clearing rate, will typically not be supported by ATM switches, and furthermore cannot be readily expressed through the ATM signaling. This means that the ATM network has to be accounted for as a fixed delay component on the path. <p> It is, however, possible to greatly reduce the impact of this inaccuracy, by allowing some flexibility in the delay guarantee that is eventually required from the ATM network, i.e., provide a safety margin around the advertised value. Such a capability is included in <ref> [16] </ref> as the delay slack S. The slack S corresponds to what remains of the end-to-end delay budget after the receiver has chosen a value for R. A receiver could purposely 4 select an R value so as to create some slack. <p> This can mean better estimates for the delay guarantees that an ATM network can provide, or extensions to ATM signaling and service specifications to better emulate the Integrated Services model <ref> [16] </ref>. Second, while the LIJ of the UNI 4.0 is intended to improve scalability by removing the bottleneck associated with the ingress router, it does so by shifting the pro cessing burden from the ingress router to the ATM network.
