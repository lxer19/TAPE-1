Title: Handling Updates and Crashes in VoD Systems  
Author: Eenjun Hwang, Kemal Kilic and V.S. Subrahmanian 
Abstract: Though there have been several recent efforts to develop disk based video servers, these approaches have all ignored the topic of updates and disk server crashes. In this paper, we present a priority based model for building video servers that handle two classes of events: user events that could include enter, play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, exit, as well as system events such as insert, delete, server-down, server-up that correspond to uploading new movie blocks onto the disk(s), eliminating existing blocks from the disk(s), and/or experiencing a disk server crash. We will present algorithms to handle such events. Our algorithms are provably correct, and computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we guarantee that under certain reasonable conditions, continuing clients experience jitter free presentations. We further justify the efficiency of our techniques with a prototype implementation and experimental results.

Reference-contexts: These three advances, amongst others, have caused a great increase in the quality and quantity of research into the design of video servers <ref> [2, 4, 11, 6, 10, 16] </ref>. Most models of video servers to date assume the following parameters: 1. Movies are stored, in part, or in their entirety, on one or more disks. 2. The video-on-demand VoD system is responsible for handling "events" that occur. <p> Unlike the issue of updates, disk crashes have certainly been studied extensively over the years <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. However, consider the problem of a VoD server that has made certain commitments to customers. When a crash occurs, the VoD server must try to ensure that any client being serviced by the disk that crashed be "switched" to another disk that can service that client's needs. <p> The design of disk servers is now well known <ref> [2, 4, 11, 6, 10, 16] </ref>. In its simplest form, a disk server is a piece of software that, given a physical disk address, retrieves the object located at that address.

Reference-contexts: The performance characteristics of disk servers are defined from 1 (the lowest) to 4 (the highest). Three disk server configurations considered in the experiments are homogeneous servers with highest performance characteristics, homogeneous servers with lowest performance characteristics, and heterogeneous servers with different performance characteristics <ref> [3] </ref>. In the following experiments, we examined the resilence of the video server against disk server crashes under different disk server configurations, i.e., how well the video server performs when crashes occur. The number of disk server crashes and crash time were generated randomly.
