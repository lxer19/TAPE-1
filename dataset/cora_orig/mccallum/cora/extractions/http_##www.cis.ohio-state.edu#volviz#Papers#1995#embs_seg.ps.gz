Abstract: III. RESULTS A geometry file was generated for each image and used in dividing the intimal layer of the arterial cross-section into 36 equal radial segments for comparison [1]. Lipid area was computed in each segment for both manually classified (MCLS) and automatically classified (ACLS) images. Total lipid area in the image was found by adding the lipid areas in each segment. The correlation coefficient between the two classifications was computed over the 36 segments for each slide. Correlation shows how well the position of lipid in the two classifications match, even though the absolute values of total lipid areas (i.e., manual and automated) differed. Figure 3 shows that more than 50% of the slides had a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8. Thus, we can say that there was a good positional match between the two classifications. A scatter plot of the total lipid area of ACLS vs. MCLS [1] showed that manual classification lipid area was typically greater than automated classification lipid area. The comparison with manual classification showed that the automated classification was reproducible and more accurate. The manual classification overestimates the amount of lipid particularly when the ORO positive areas are small and punc-tate. In this situation the manual observer identified an entire region as being ORO positive as opposed to individually identifying numerous small areas. This regional segmentation results in overestimation, as normal tissue is included with the punctate ORO regions. In addition, when there is a gradual transition from red stained lipid to unstained normal tissue, the human eye is unable to reproducibly segment the image into lipid and normal tissue at the same hue of pink. Automated classification eliminates this subjective variance in segmentation and thus improves reproducibility. When the illumination of the slides changes or when the tissue color pigment changes slightly due to some natural factors, the tissue clusters tend to shift slightly in the color space. This may lead to false classification of a small portion of the slide with the method described above. One possible way to over come this problem is to grow clusters dynamically on the histogram of each image from seed points. The center of a tissue cluster (i.e., seed point) was obtained by averaging a few images. Since the shift of clusters in color space from image to image was small, a single seed point could be utilized for all images. The clusters were modeled as gaussian, and the growth was stopped when the empirically determined probability limit was reached. Unfortunately, this approach fails when there is not enough tissue present in the image to form a well-behaved cluster and is limited by the fact that the clusters are not truly gaussian in nature. The current method is semiautomatic in the sense that it uses a learning set, albeit a small one. Complete automatization may be achieved by using global clustering techniques in the color space. Use of this segmentation algorithm in other image-processing fields is still being explored. One such example is quick segmentation of aerial photographs taken by a remote-controlled plane or satellite into blue water, brown (sandy) desert and green pastoral land. In conclusion, an efficient method for automated classification of histological slides has been implemented. The automated classifier performance was measured by segmenting a set of coronary artery slides and comparing the automated results with those from manual classification. This classifier was easy to use. Non-experts could accurately classify slides. Subjective variance present in manual classification was reduced significantly. The classification and training stages were found to be less computationally expensive than previous algorithms. The system was designed for use on personal computers and low-end workstations as the ultimate goal is use in clinical settings. The work presented in this paper was supported by Grants HL33760 and HL45694 from the National Institutes of Health. The authors gratefully acknowledge the many useful discussions they had with other PDAY investigators[4] and the histological slides provided by them.
