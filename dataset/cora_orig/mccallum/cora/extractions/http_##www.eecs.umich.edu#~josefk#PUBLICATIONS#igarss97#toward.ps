Abstract: Recent research identified a small number of vegetation characteristics that are essential to describe parameters needed for global atmosphere-biosphere models. Efforts to derive some of these characteristics from satellite remote sensing focussed on the use of AVHRR NDVI datasets, and global land cover characteristics data bases were produced. The usefulness of this dataset is hampered by the fact, that low spatial resolution of the AHVRR data results in the necessary definition of mixed herbaceous/shrub/tree classes, where the % mixture of these basic physiogomic classes are unknown. Radar is known to be very sensitive to vegetation physiognomy and biomass. In a study at the University of Michigan the potential of the existing orbital SAR imaging systems JERS-1 and ERS-1/2 for vegetation mapping has been investigated. Both sensors have mapped the global land masses within a period of four years. Using the complimentary characteristics of frequency (L-, C-Band) and polarization (hh, vv), a classification scheme was developed to produce vegetation maps at a scale of ca. 1:200,000 with classes based on physiognomic characteristics of vegetation. The approach uses unsupervised clustering techniques and class assignment based on radar signatures, hence consistent, automatic classification is possible. The combination of the high spatial resolution of JERS/ERS SAR composites and the high temporal resolution of the AVHRR based datasets could be the winning combination to describe vegetation distribution and vegetation dynamics.

Reference-contexts: US when comparing vegetation classes from the USGS Land use/Land cover (LULC) data from 1979, based on Ultra High Altitude Photography (UHAP), classification from the Land Cover Characteristics (LCC) prototype dataset from 1990 and classification from the preliminary release of the "North America Land Cover Characteristics Data Base" from 1993 <ref> [3] </ref>. To facilitate comparison, vegetation classes from the different datasets were translated to the vegetation characteristics woodiness (tree, shrub, herb) and leaf type/seasonality (deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needle-leaf). The percentages in Tab. 2 represent % coverage of these vegetation characteristics in five test sites through-out the US [4].

The percentages in Tab. 2 represent % coverage of these vegetation characteristics in five test sites through-out the US <ref> [4] </ref>. Generally, discrepancies between the classifications can be seen to be great, even at the simplified level herbaceous/shrub/tree. Also, mixed categories had to be introduced to represent unresolvable class mixtures, esp. within the LCC data. <p> Since the dependencies on soil moisture and roughness vary with frequency, there is a general potential to overcome the last two constraints by using the approriate ISODATA in five test sites from different eco-regions; class assignment was based on measured ERS/JERS signatures using the minimum euclidian distance <ref> [4] </ref>. wavelength combination for surface characterization. For example, a bare soil might appear rough at C-Band (5cm wavelength) with strong backscatter towards the sensor, whereas the longer L-Band (ca. 23cm) measurements are still dominated by specular scattering away from the sensor. <p> A developed hybrid "unsupervised clustering/minimum distance class assignment" technique showed overall classification accuracies for the testing part of the polygons of &gt;80% <ref> [4] </ref>. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the classified cluster centers in a ERS-1/JERS-1 scattergramm. Tab. 2 shows the percentages for vegetation cover types in the five test sites resulting from this classification process.

Reference-contexts: Also, mixed categories had to be introduced to represent unresolvable class mixtures, esp. within the LCC data. This is partly due to the effective low spatial resolution of 3 fi 2 km 2 of the multitem-poral NDVI datasets <ref> [5] </ref>. Hence, the information content from the multitemporal NDVI datasets in particular and the AVHRR data in general for observation of global vegetation dynamics needs improvement in distinction of basic vegetation categories. 2.
