Abstract: An intriguing open question is whether the graph formed by the middle two levels of the Boolean lattice of subsets of a 2k + 1-element set has a Hamilton path for all k 1: We consider finding a lower bound on the length of the longest cycle in this graph. A result of Babai for vertex transitive graphs gives a lower bound of (3N ) 1=2 , where N is the total number of vertices in the middle two levels. In this paper we show how to construct a cycle of length N c where c :836.

Reference-contexts: Is there at least a good lower bound on the length of the longest cycle in the bipartite graph formed by the middle two levels of the Boolean lattice? No lower bound of the form c fl N is known. Since this graph is vertex transitive, Babai's result <ref> [Ba] </ref> shows that there is a cycle of length at least (3N ) 1=2 , where N is the total number of vertices in the middle two levels.

Reference-contexts: As we will show in the next section, a result of Dejter and Quintana can be used to construct a cycle of length at least N t where t = (log3)=(log4) :793 <ref> [DQ] </ref>. The main result of this paper is a technique for constructing a cycle of length (N t ) where t :836. <p> If k = 1, this is clear, otherwise, assume the lemma is true for some k 1.

Reference-contexts: One approach to this problem which has been considered is to try to form a Hamilton cycle as the union of two edge-disjoint matchings. In <ref> [DSW] </ref>, it was shown that a Hamilton cycle in the middle two levels cannot be the union of two lexicographic matchings. However, other matchings may work.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the best known is the middle two levels problem which is attributed in <ref> [KT] </ref> to Dejter, Erd-os, and Trotter and by others to Havel and Kelley. This problem has been attacked by several researchers with no success. <p> In [DSW], it was shown that a Hamilton cycle in the middle two levels cannot be the union of two lexicographic matchings. However, other matchings may work. Motivated by this approach to the problem, Kierstead and Trotter <ref> [KT] </ref> define a large class of matchings, called lexical matchings in the middle two levels.

Reference-contexts: The graph formed by the middle two levels is a connected, undirected, vertex transitive graph. Thus, either it has a Hamilton path, or it provides a counterexample to the Lovasz conjecture that every connected, undirected, vertex transitive graph has Hamilton path <ref> [Lo] </ref>. One approach to this problem which has been considered is to try to form a Hamilton cycle as the union of two edge-disjoint matchings. In [DSW], it was shown that a Hamilton cycle in the middle two levels cannot be the union of two lexicographic matchings.

Another variation is the central layers problem: in B n , for which values 13 of k is there a Hamilton path among layers k through n k? (Edges are defined by the covering relation in the lattice.) The graph in this variation is no longer vertex transitive.
