Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the progressive simplicial complex (PSC) representation, a new format for storing and transmitting triangulated geometric models. Like the earlier progressive mesh (PM) representation, it captures a given model as a coarse base model together with a sequence of refinement transformations that progressively recover detail. The PSC representation makes use of a more general refinement transformation, allowing the given model to be an arbitrary triangulation (e.g. any dimension, non-orientable, non-manifold, non-regular), and the base model to always consist of a single vertex. Indeed, the sequence of refinement transformations encodes both the geometry and the topology of the model in a unified multiresolution framework. The PSC representation retains the advantages of PM's. It defines a continuous sequence of approximating models for runtime level-of-detail control, allows smooth transitions between any pair of models in the sequence, supports progressive transmission, and offers a space-efficient representation. Moreover, by allowing changes to topology, the PSC sequence of approximations achieves better fidelity than the corresponding PM sequence. We develop an optimization algorithm for constructing PSC representations for graphics surface models, and demonstrate the framework on models that are both geometrically and topologically complex.

Reference-contexts: Our approach differs in that we order the vunify in a carefully optimized sequence. More importantly, we define not only a simplification process, but also a new representation for the model using an encoding of gvspl = vunify 1 transformations. Recent, independent work by Schmalstieg and Schaufler <ref> [23] </ref> develops a similar strategy of encoding a model using a sequence of vertex split transformations. Their scheme differs in that it tracks only triangles, and therefore requires regular, 2-dimensional triangulations. Hence, it does not allow lower-dimensional simplices in the model approximations, and does not generalize to higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: For the sake of simplicity, we avoid explicitly storing surface normals at corners (using a set S) as done in [13]. Instead we let the material identifier d s contain a smoothing group field <ref> [28] </ref>, and let a normal discontinuity (crease) form between any pair of adjacent triangles with different smoothing groups. Previous vertex unification schemes [21, 22] render principal simplices of dimension 0 and 1 (denoted P 01 (K)) as points and lines respectively with fixed, device-dependent screen widths.

Reference-contexts: Polyhedra can also be represented using more general representations. The simplicial set representation of Lang and Lienhardt [17] generalizes simplicial complexes to allow incomplete and degenerate simplices. Cell complexes, formed by subdividing manifolds into non-simplicial cells, can be represented using the radial edge structure of Weiler <ref> [29] </ref> or the cell tuple structure of Brisson [5]. 7 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK We have introduced the progressive simplicial complex representation, a new format for arbitrary triangulated models that captures both geometry and topology in a unified multiresolution framework.
