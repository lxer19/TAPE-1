Abstract: Real-world data, esp. three-dimensional measurements of buildings, contain various irregularities, e.g. common vertices of building parts. These irregularities cause large problems in data conversion from CSG to B-rep. We will present an approach which can tackle these irregularities using geometrical properties of buildings and extensions of basic operations from the field of analytic geometry. An extensive 3D scene will be described and converted.

Nevertheless, if a point p "touches" a face f close to a vertex v of f , then it might take place that v will be classified as not coincident to p, even it is (cf. <p> Figure 3). incompleteness: incomplete data include that e.g. faces may emanate from "closed physical objects". Hence such buildings are not 2-manifolds again. As consequence an integrity check of the modeled buildings as proposed in e.g. <ref> (Mantyla 1988) </ref> is not possible.
