Title: A polylog(n)-competitive algorithm for metrical task systems  
Author: Yair Bartal Avrim Blum Carl Burch Andrew Tomkins 
Note: 2 O(c 6 log 6 k).  
Abstract: We present a randomized on-line algorithm for the Metrical Task System problem that achieves a competitive ratio of O(log 6 n) for arbitrary metric spaces, against an oblivious adversary. This is the first algorithm to achieve a sub-linear competitive ratio for all metric spaces. Our algorithm uses a recent result of Bartal [Bar96] that an arbitrary metric space can be probabilistically approximated by a set of metric spaces called k-hierarchical well-separated trees (k-HST's). Indeed, the main technical result of this paper is an O(log n)-competitive algorithm for (log n)-HST spaces. This, combined with the result of [Bar96], yields the general bound. Note that for the k-server problem on metric spaces of k + c points our result implies a competitive ratio of

Reference-contexts: long-standing conjecture maintains that the correct answer is fi (log n): that is, that an on-line algorithm exists with competitive ratio O (log n) for every metric space, and that there is no metric space for which one can do better than (log n). 1.1 The k-HST approximation Recently, Bartal <ref> [Bar96] </ref> made important progress by reducing the problem on general metric spaces to the problem on one particular type of space.

In the remainder of this paper, we show how to achieve a ratio polylogarithmic in n only, without restricting the class of metric spaces in any way. 4 Combining two regions 4.1 Strategy We wish to remove the appearance of in the ratio.

That the strategy is w-based is obvious. <p> To do this, we need a method for carefully combining two spaces of unequal ratios. In this section we consider this problem of carefully combining two regions. For s = 1, the problem is one examined by Blum, Karloff, Rabani, and Saks <ref> [BKRS92] </ref>. (They were concerned with a metric space consisting of two spaces separated by a large distance. That paper was able to ignore the internal potential functions and additive constants by assuming the two spaces were sufficiently far apart.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Metrical Task System (MTS) problem, introduced by Borodin, Linial, and Saks <ref> [BLS92] </ref>, can be stated as follows. Consider a machine that can be in one of n states or configurations. This machine is given a sequence of tasks, where each task has an associated cost vector specifying the cost of performing the task in each state of the machine. <p> Specifically, we say that randomized algorithm A has competitive ratio r if, for some a, for all , E [c A ()] r c OPT () + a Borodin, Linial, and Saks <ref> [BLS92] </ref> present a deterministic on-line MTS algorithm with a competitive ratio of 2n 1 and prove that this is optimal for deterministic algorithms. They also show that with randomization one can achieve a competitive ratio of O (log n) for the special case of the uniform metric space. <p> Irani and Seiden [IS95] present a randomized algorithm for general spaces that achieves a competitive ratio of roughly 1:58n. Two types of lower bounds are known for randomized MTS algorithms. For certain specific metric spaces such as the uniform space <ref> [BLS92] </ref>, and the superincreasing space [KRR91], there are (log n) bounds on the competitive ratio of any randomized on-line algorithm. More generally, a weaker lower bound of (log log n) [KRR91], subsequently improved to ( p log n= log log n) [BKRS92], applies to every metric space.

Reference-contexts: For a point i in the metric space, let w i denote the optimal off-line cost of ending in state i after servicing all tasks so far. (This is sometimes called the work function <ref> [CL91] </ref>.) Given a task (i; ffi), the value of w j for j 6= i does not change, and w i becomes minfw i + ffi; min j6=i w j + d ij g, where d ij is the distance between i and j.

Reference-contexts: The MTS problem is related to the k-server problem introduced by Manasse, McGeoch, and Sleator <ref> [MMS90] </ref>. In particular, a k-server problem on k + c points can be ex pressed as a k+c -state MTS problem in which each state represents a configuration of the servers.

Reference-contexts: The off-line player, on the other hand, pays only ffi for servicing (i; ffi) in region i and only d when it moves between regions. This scenario is a generalization of the aptly named unfair two state problem of Seiden <ref> [Sei96] </ref>. While the primary goal in developing algorithms for this scenario is to optimize the competitive ratio, our secondary goal is to limit the maximum value of the potential function used by the algorithm. <p> Because we cannot afford to assume the spaces are so separated, we must be more careful and introduce s &gt; 1.) By appropriately modifying the technique used in that paper, we get a strategy for Scenario 1 with two regions. (Seiden <ref> [Sei96] </ref> independently developed the same algorithm.
