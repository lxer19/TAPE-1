Abstract: Refinable functions are an intrinsic part of subdivision schemes and wavelet constructions. The relevant properties of such functions must usually be determined from their refinement masks. In this paper, we provide a characterization of linear independence for the shifts of a multivariate refinable distribution in terms of its (finitely supported) refinement mask.

Reference-contexts: This definition naturally extends to distributions. If the refinement mask a satisfies X a (ff) = 2 s ; (1:2) then it is known (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) that Eq. (1.1) has a unique compactly supported distribution solution subject to the condition ^ (0) = 1. This distribution is said to be the normalized solution to the refinement equation with mask a. <p> Let := ( k ) k2K . Then is a vector of functions supported on the unit cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s and continuous on [0; 1) s . By E we denote the set f0; 1g s of all vertices of the unit cube [0; 1] s . <p> Let := ( k ) k2K . Then is a vector of functions supported on the unit cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s and continuous on [0; 1) s . By E we denote the set f0; 1g s of all vertices of the unit cube [0; 1] s . For " 2 E, let A " be the linear operator on C K given by A " v (j) := k2K where v 2 C K . <p> Then is the n-fold convolution of with the characteristic function of the unit cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s , and it is well-known that N ( ) = N (). In particular, has linearly independent shifts if and only if does. 3 2. <p> Evidently, G is dense in the closed cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s . We claim that (x) 2 V for each x = (m 1 =2 n ; : : : ; m s =2 n ) 2 G. This will be done by induction on n. <p> Let be a vector in C K such that h; vi = 0 for all v 2 V . By what has been proved, h; (x)i = 0 for all x 2 G. But G is dense in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s and is continuous on [0; 1) s . Therefore, we have h; (x)i = 0 for all x 2 [0; 1) s . This shows that (b) implies (a).

Reference-contexts: For a compactly supported distribution , define N () := c 2 `(ZZ s ) : ff2ZZ s o Then is said to have linearly independent shifts if N () is trivial, i.e., N () = f0g. When is a compactly supported continuous function, Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [2] </ref> showed that N () is non-trivial if and only if it contains an exponential, i.e., a sequence of the form (z ff ) ff2ZZ s for some z 2 (C n f0g) s . Linear independence is a necessary condition for orthogonality, or even biorthogonal-ity, of refinable functions. <p> Moreover, c 2 N () if and only if cflv = 0 for all v 2 V , where cflv 2 `(ZZ s ) is defined by cflv (ff) := X c (ff k)v (k); ff 2 ZZ s : Proof. According to <ref> [2] </ref>, the shifts of are linearly dependent if and only if there exists z 2 (C n f0g) s such that P j2ZZ s z j ( j) = 0: For z 2 (C n f0g) s , define z 2 C K by z (k) := z k (k 2

Reference-contexts: To apply our results to these examples, we will need to know that the associated subdivision schemes converge. To this end, we recall some definitions and results from [11] and <ref> [3] </ref>. Let W be a finite dimensional normed linear space with norm k k. As usual, the norm of a linear operator A on W is defined by kAk := max fkAvkg: Let A be a finite collection of linear operators on W . <p> in [11] to be (A) := lim kA n k 1=n : It is well-known that (A) is independent of which norm is used in W and that (A) = inf kA n k 1=n : (3:1) In the case s = 1, the joint spectral radius was used in <ref> [3] </ref> to derive sufficient conditions to ensure continuity of the normalized solution to Eq. (1.1).

Reference-contexts: So B " := A " j W is a linear operator on W for each " 2 E. According to <ref> [4] </ref>, the subdivision scheme associated with a converges if and only if X and 6 The masks of our examples clearly satisfy the first of these conditions, and we don't mention it again.

Reference-contexts: For a vector 2 C K , the following two conditions are equivalent: (a) h; (x)i = 0 for all x 2 [0; 1) s . Remark: A variation of Lemma 1 has been provided already by Theorem 2.7 of <ref> [5] </ref>. In fact, it was that theorem which motivated our current work. Proof. Suppose is a vector in C K such that h; (x)i = 0 for all x 2 [0; 1) s . Since u = (11=2), we have h; ui = 0.

Reference-contexts: In fact, our results provide a characterization of stability for the shifts of , since we characterize all expo-nentials in N () and has stable shifts if and only if N () contains an exponential which lies on the s-dimensional unit torus (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). A characterization of stability for refinable functions in L 2 (IR s ) has also been provided by Lawton, Lee, and Shen in [10] but, as our examples in Section 3 demonstrate, the results of this paper can be significantly less complicated to apply. <p> Note that since (1=2; 1=2) is not on the 2-dimensional torus, TT 2 := fz 2 C 2 : jz 1 j = jz 2 j = 1g; and 2 L 1 (IR 2 ), Theorem 1 of <ref> [8] </ref> implies that has ` p -stable shifts for any 0 &lt; p 1. Example 2. <p> These polynomials have two common zeros: 1 2 (1+ 3i; 1+ 3i) 2 (1 3i; 1 3i). Therefore, we conclude that the shifts of are linearly dependent. Since these common zeros actually lie on TT 2 , Theorem 1 of <ref> [8] </ref> implies that the shifts of are in fact not stable. Although this could be determined using results from [10], the computations would be significantly more complicated.
