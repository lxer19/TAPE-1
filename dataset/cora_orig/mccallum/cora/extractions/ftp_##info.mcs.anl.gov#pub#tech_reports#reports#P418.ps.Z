Title: A Superquadratic Infeasible-Interior-Point Method for Linear Complementarity Problems  
Author: Stephen Wright and Yin Zhang 
Abstract: February 8, 1994 (Revised December, 1994) RESEARCH REPORT YZ94-03, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, UMBC PREPRINT MCS-P418-0294, MCS DIVISION, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY Abstract We consider a modification of a path-following infeasible-interior-point algorithm described by Wright. In the new algorithm, we attempt to improve each major iterate by reusing the coefficient matrix factors from the latest step. We show that the modified algorithm has similar theoretical global convergence properties to those of the earlier algorithm, while its asymptotic convergence rate can be made superquadratic by an appropriate parameter choice.

Therefore, Assumption 3 implies the boundedness of the iteration sequence f (x k ; y k )g, as given in the following lemma.

Reference-contexts: Mehrotra presented a practical implementation of a predictor-corrector algorithm that reuses the matrix factors in [9] and an asymptotic theoretical analysis in [8]. Mehrotra's theoretical algorithm differs significantly from the practical method. It requires strict feasibility of all iterates, and it uses the Mizuno-Todd-Ye <ref> [10] </ref> predictor-corrector framework, which confines the iterates to a narrow Euclidean-norm neighborhood of the central path and requires corrector steps (and hence extra matrix factorizations) to be performed regularly. Our algorithm achieves rapid asymptotic convergence like that described in [8] but for a wider class of problems (LCP).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the inner loop (with iteration index i) eventually executes for all I iterations before control passes back to the main loop and, assuming that rF (z) is Lipschitz continuous at z fl , the convergence has Q-order I + 2 (see, for example, <ref> [12] </ref>). Note that for each value of k, the Jacobian rF (z k ) is evaluated and factored only once and, in many contexts, the steps d calculated in the improvement loop are not expensive to compute.
