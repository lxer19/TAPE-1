Abstract: To find out how big the Internet is, we measured the round-trip delays and hop-counts from a UCLA host computer to a randomly selected set of three thousand Internet hosts around the world. Our results show that over 90% of these hosts in continental US are within 18 hops from UCLA, and the round-trip delays to 90% of these hosts are less than 153ms. There seems no strong correlation between the delay and hop-count, although the average delay increases with hop-count. Measurements to international hosts show that the delay and hop-count strongly depend on the countries the hosts locate. Physical distances and link speeds are the most important factors that determine the round-trip delay.

Reference-contexts: In [K91], systematic measurements were taken to see how the network delay varied with different packet sizes, different paths, different times during the day, and different days in a week. In <ref> [B93] </ref>, the author reported analysis of end-to-end packet delay and loss behavior from observing the round trip delays of small UDP packets sent at regular time intervals.

Reference-contexts: Network delay varies with different time of the day, however there is no definite correlation between the time and the delay. Furthermore, the three destinations exhibited different delay variation patterns. Some end-to-end delay and hop-count measurements are also reported in some research of choosing replicated Internet servers <ref> [CC96, GS95] </ref>. Along with the examination of different approaches for locating nearby replicated Internet servers, the authors in [GS95] discussed an optimized approach for hop-count probing and presented some statistics of Internet hop-count. For example, they reported an average 17.0 hops among 8,098 Internet site pairs. <p> Along with the examination of different approaches for locating nearby replicated Internet servers, the authors in [GS95] discussed an optimized approach for hop-count probing and presented some statistics of Internet hop-count. For example, they reported an average 17.0 hops among 8,098 Internet site pairs. In <ref> [CC96] </ref>, the authors showed that empirical distributions of hop-count and round-trip time to 5,262 Internet servers are dramatically different. <p> At the same time, the standard deviation of delay is comparable with the mean delay. This means there is no strong correlation between hop count and delay. In other words, one can't accurately predict the delay to a host given the hop-count, as suggested in <ref> [CC96] </ref>. Our observation shows that delay is not simply determined by number of hops, it depends on a lot of other factors, including physical distance, distance to the backbone, link capacities and traffic conditions along the route. This also demonstrates the great heterogeneity of the Internet. <p> A sound definition should also be a description of an executable empirical method to measure such a metric. An alternative metric to represent "how big the Internet is" would be the average hop-count because of some good properties of hop-count distribution. As shown in the previous section and in <ref> [CC96] </ref>, hop-count is pretty much evenly distributed with the mean at the center. So average hop-count should give us a fairly good impression on how "deep" "vertically"[GR97] the Internet is.

Reference-contexts: If we can succeed in discovering the Internet topology, one will be able to discover information, which ISPs are unwilling to provide to public, by sending probe packets and collecting routes. A new research project, the Internet Distance-Map Service (IDMaps) <ref> [F97] </ref>, aims at discovering such topology information (and more) to meet applications needs. Our measurement project could be considered an early experimental step in that direction.

There is an ongoing research effort to visualize backbones of different ISPs (Internet Service Provider)[MAPNET]. They have a database of backbone topologies of a number of ISPs and provide a Java applet to visualize the maps.

Reference-contexts: We need a set of hosts randomly selected from the global Internet as the destinations for our measurement. We found a list of DNS servers from the Inter-NIC ftp site <ref> [NIC] </ref>, and randomly picked a set of IP addresses from that list as our study subjects. In order to study the effect of physical location on hop-count and delay, we also hand-picked a number of hosts.

Reference-contexts: This can be caused by a number of different reasons: the probe packet or the reply may have got lost, or a router may be configured not to send back time-exceeded ICMP message, or it only generates ICMP messages at a limited rate <ref> [P96] </ref>. Without receiving a reply within the timeout period, a second packet with the same TTL will be sent. The timer we used is 5 seconds; our measurements show that delays to all hosts reached, except those in China, are far less than 5 seconds.

These measurement studies not only exposed the unexpected behavior of the current Internet protocols, but also help us better understand the dynamics of large scale systems. <p> After all the packets are sent and replies are received (or timed out), the average is taken as the round-trip delay. One may take half of the round-trip delay as one-way delay, but since routes may be asymmetric <ref> [P97] </ref>, it can only be an approximation. In this paper we report the round-trip delay only. We ran our program on a Sun Ultra Sparc-1 machine with Solaris 2.5.1 to collect all the data. Some details in the measurement are worth mentioning. Sometimes a probe packet receives no reply. <p> Intuitively one may think "the di-ameter of the Internet" is the number of hops of the longest route needed to connect two far-apart hosts. In our measurement, the longest route recorded has a hop-count of 27. In measurement of <ref> [P97] </ref>, the longest route is 32 hops. Such a diameter gives us the impression of how big the Internet is in size. However, since one can hardly claim a long route he or she observed is indeed the longest one, the above intuitive definition may not be easily measurable. <p> Some people believe that it grows as the logarithm of the size (number of nodes) of the Internet. When Internet size grows exponentially, we expect its "diameter" to grow linearly. There is evidence that average hop-count does increase with the growth of the Internet. In <ref> [P97] </ref>, the author reports that, the mean hop-count of routes measured during November and December 1994 is 15.6, while that measured during November and December 1995 is 16.2.

Reference-contexts: During spring 1996, Rautman, a UCLA graduate student, used traceroute to measure the delays and routes from UCLA to three specific sites at USC, MIT, and UCL (University College London) <ref> [R96] </ref>. Rautman's main interest was to find out how the network delay may vary with time and day as in [K76]. He reported that the variance in delay from day-to-day is not large, although weekend days tend to have less delay. <p> This also demonstrates the great heterogeneity of the Internet. As pointed out by Rautman <ref> [R96] </ref>, delay varies with time-of-day and day-of-week. The results we show here were obtained during weekdays, most measurements last from afternoon to night, some were done at midnight. <p> Because our measurements have a large sample space, it takes a long time to finish (more than one hour for 100 US hosts, longer for international hosts), we were unable to do measurements at some specific time and compare. However, according to Rautman <ref> [R96] </ref>, the variation is not very large, especially when the de lay is long (e.g. about 100ms to MIT), it is about 10% to 20%. Although the delay to a given host fluctuates, our large sample space should minimize the effect of a single event.
