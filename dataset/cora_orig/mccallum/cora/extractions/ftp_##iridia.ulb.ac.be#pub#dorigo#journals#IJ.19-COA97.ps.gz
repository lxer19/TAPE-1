Reference-contexts: Previous research on this problem concentrated on heuristic approaches <ref> [10] </ref> . <p> Tabu search Tabu search (TS) is another evolutionary heuristic that updates a single solution. It was originally proposed in [15, 16]; specific applications to TTP are presented by Hertz and de Werra <ref> [10, 17, 18] </ref> . The idea behind TS is to start from a random solution and successively move it to one of its current neighbors. Each time a move is performed, the reverse one is linked at the beginning of a fixed-length list of inhibited moves, the tabu list.

Reference-contexts: The main goal of our work is to compare these metaheuristic on hard, real-world combinatorial optimization problem instances and thus to evaluate their relative merits. As a test problem we have chosen the timetable problem (TTP), that is known to be NP-hard <ref> [12] </ref> , but which has been intensively investigated given its great practical relevance [1,2,3,4,5,9,10,13,14,17,18 , 20,28] . We will use the construction of a timetable, or schedule of classes, for an Italian high school as a benchmark for our investigation.

Reference-contexts: Particularly efficient instantiation of evolutionary algorithms are represented by simulated annealing [21], in which the natural analogy is the annealing process for metals, by genetic algorithms (GA) <ref> [19] </ref> , in which the natural analogy is population genetics, and by tabu search [15, 16]. <p> Again, we do not detail our state-of-the-art implementation of TS: the interested reader is referred to Glover [15, 16] or Taillard [31]. Genetic algorithm The GA <ref> [19] </ref> is a population-based evolutionary heuristic, where every possible solution is represented by a specific encoding, often called an individual. Usually the GA is initialized by a set of randomly generated feasible solutions (a population), but problemspecific initializations are possible. <p> The need to distinguish between objective function (o.f.) and fitness function (f.f.) comes from the necessity to define the o.f. with reference to a cost minimization problem, while the standard GA as introduced by Holland <ref> [19] </ref> structurally solves maximization problems. The translation from o.f. into f.f. can be obtained by simply mapping the numeric values of the former into those of the latter, by means of a monotonically decreasing function. In particular, our system is based on a linear dynamic fitness scaling procedure.

Reference-contexts: In the traveling salesman case the most successful approaches have been the introduction of a new crossover operator and the application of genetic repair <ref> [27, 26] </ref> . The redefinition of mutation is in this case particularly straightforward: it is sufficient to exchange the position of two cities in the string. <p> The GA with local search was found to be definitely superior to its counterpart, in accordance with the indications expressed by Mhlenbein <ref> [27] </ref> . Figure 5 presents the evolution of the best values in the two cases for the 1992/1993 problem instance. Both runs lasted eight hours. The difference in the number of generations is due to the computational cost of local search.
