Abstract: We introduce an image compression and transmission system for battlefield networks. The system is based on network-conscious image compression, an approach to compression that does not simply maximize compression, but which optimizes overall performance when compressed images are transmitted over a lossy, packet-switched battlefield network. Using an Application Level Framing philosophy, an image is compressed into path-MTU-size Application Data Units (ADUs) at the application layer. Each ADU is independent of others and carries its own semantics, that is, each ADU is a self-contained unit possessing all information necessary for decoding and displaying the information within that packet. Each independent ADU can be delivered to the receiving application out-of-order, thereby enabling faster progressive display of the image. We combine network-conscious image compression with an embedded focusing feature to provide a system that can be used in battlefield scenarios such as telemedicine or intelligence gathering. a
