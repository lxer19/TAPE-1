Abstract: Ad-hoc networks consist of a set of mobile hosts that communicate using wireless links, without the use of other communication support facilities (such as base stations). The topology of an ad-hoc network changes due to the movement of mobile hosts leading to sudden packet losses and delays. Transport protocols like TCP, which have been designed mainly for fixed networks, misinterpret this loss as congestion and invoke congestion control. This leads to unnecessary retransmissions and loss of throughput. To overcome this problem, we propose a feedback scheme whereby, the source can distinguish between route failure and network congestion. The main idea is to inform the source by a Route Failure Notification (RFN) when the route is disrupted allowing the source to freeze its timers and stop sending packets (new or retransmitted) as long as the source cannot reach the destination. When the route is re-established, the source, on being informed through a Route Re-establishment Notification (RRN), resumes by un-freezing its timers and continuing packet transmissions. The simulated performance of TCP on ad-hoc networks with and without feedback is compared and reported. We observed that in the event of route failures, as the route re-establishment time increases, the use of feedback provides significant gains in throughput as well as savings in unnecessary packet transmissions. Further enhancements and directions for future work are also sketched. fl This work was supported in part by the Texas Advanced Technology Program under Grant No. 9741-052 and by NSF under Grant No. CCR-9796331.

Reference-contexts: The end-to-end communication problem has been studied in the context of cellular wireless networks, and a number of modifications and extensions to TCP for such networks have been proposed <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 19] </ref>. It is desirable to use TCP directly even in ad-hoc 2 networks in order to provide seamless portability to applications such as file transfer, email and WWW browsers written using standard TCP libraries. <p> Our preliminary studies indicate that as a result of frequent and unpredictable route disruptions, TCP's performance substantially degrades both in terms of throughput and goodput (the ratio of useful data received at the destination and the total data transmitted by the source) <ref> [3] </ref>. We propose a feedback based scheme for overcoming this problem. Our simulation experiments show that the use of feedback mechanisms, along with TCP, can result in substantial performance improvements. Section 2 of the paper describes the ad-hoc network model and assumptions. <p> Feedback based schemes for TCP have already been proposed in the form of explicit congestion notification (ECN) [8] for fixed networks and EBSN <ref> [3] </ref> in cellular networks. ECN is used in order to hasten the process of congestion detection while in our case we use feedback to explicitly notify the source of route failure. <p> The simulation model is shown in Figure 3. 9 5.2 Implementation Simulation Parameters: For our experiments, we used a fixed packet size of 200 bytes and data rate of 12.8 Kbps (on the wireless channels), which are reasonable values for wireless networks <ref> [3] </ref>. The number of hops between the source and the destination is set to 10 and the corresponding window size is 4 KBytes (20 packets). In the simulation, we have assumed that the network does not suffer from congestion. Consequently, any packet loss is attributed to route failure only.

Reference-contexts: In general, the transport connection may be unidirectional or bidirectional. For ease of exposition, we will treat the connection to be unidirectional. 3 Behavior of TCP in Ad-hoc Networks TCP is a reliable, stream-oriented transport layer protocol, which has been designed for use over fixed networks like the Internet <ref> [5] </ref>. It has been established that packet error/loss rates over the Internet due to transmission errors are of the order of 1% [10]. In other words, packets are rarely lost. Route failures and disruptions are very infrequent as the network is fixed.

Reference-contexts: This is likely to result in 16 gaps in the receiver's window, thus affecting TCP's cumulative acknowledgement scheme. It is worthwhile exploring alternative end-to-end acknowledgement schemes such as Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) <ref> [14] </ref> and comparing their relative performance with the performance using cumulative acknowledgement schemes in ad-hoc networks. We plan to study the mutual effects of feedback and congestion on TCP performance in greater detail.
