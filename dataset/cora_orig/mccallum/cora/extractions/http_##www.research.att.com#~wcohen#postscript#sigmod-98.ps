Title: Integration of Heterogeneous Databases Without Common Domains Using Queries Based on Textual Similarity  
Author: William W. Cohen

Abstract: Most databases contain "name constants" like course numbers, personal names, and place names that correspond to entities in the real world. Previous work in integration of heterogeneous databases has assumed that local name constants can be mapped into an appropriate global domain by normalization. However, in many cases, this assumption does not hold; determining if two name constants should be considered identical can require detailed knowledge of the world, the purpose of the user's query, or both. In this paper, we reject the assumption that global domains can be easily constructed, and assume instead that the names are given in natural language text. We then propose a logic called WHIRL which reasons explicitly about the similarity of local names, as measured using the vector-space model commonly adopted in statistical information retrieval. We describe an efficient implementation of WHIRL and evaluate it experimentally on data extracted from the World Wide Web. We show that WHIRL is much faster than naive inference methods, even for short queries. We also show that inferences made by WHIRL are surprisingly accurate, equaling the accuracy of hand-coded normalization routines on one benchmark problem, and outperforming exact matching with a plausible global domain on a second.

Reference-contexts: Largely inspired by the proliferation of database-like sources on the World Wide Web, previous researchers have addressed a diverse set of problems, ranging from access to "semi-structured" information sources <ref> [ 38; 1; 39 ] </ref> to combining databases with differing schemata [ 26; 13 ] . In this paper we will consider another aspect of data integration: the integration of databases that lack common domains. <p> There have also been a number of approaches to data integration which address issues orthogonal to the problem of lack of common domains. Examples of such work include "semi-structured" data models <ref> [ 38; 1; 39 ] </ref> ; while we have focused here on relational models, due to their simplicity, we believe that many of the basic principles of WHIRL can be applied to more complex data models as well.

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of the paper, we will first present the semantics of the WHIRL query language, and then describe an efficient query algorithm for WHIRL. Semantically WHIRL is much like earlier probabilistic or "fuzzy" database logics <ref> [ 18; 4 ] </ref> ; however, certain properties of text make efficient inference a bit trickier. <p> particular, if similarities were stored in a relation sim (X,Y) instead of being computed "on the fly", and certain irredundancy assumptions are made, then WHIRL is a strict subset of Fuhr's probabilistic Datalog [ 18 ] . 6 There are also close connections to existing formalisms for probabilistic relational databases <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> . Given this, it might well be asked why it is necessary to introduce a new and more restricted probabilistic logic. <p> In contrast, we have considered a much tighter integration between databases and statistical IR queries. The assumptions made by Chaudhuri et al are not particularly appropriate in the context of heterogeneous database integration. As noted above in Section 2.4, WHIRL is closely related to probabilistic databases (e.g., <ref> [ 18; 4 ] </ref> ). To our knowledge such database systems have not been used in data integration tasks. Furthermore, the implementation of WHIRL is unique in generating only a few "best" answers to a query; existing probabilistic database systems typically find all tuples with non-zero probability.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that the run-time for these queries is fast in part because some of the documents being joined are names. Names tend to be short and highly discriminative, and thus behave more like traditional database keys than arbitrary documents might. This point can be illustrated experimentally <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> . Elsewhere we present timing results for typical queries posed to a prototype data integration system based on WHIRL [ 10 ] . <p> In contrast, this paper focuses on efficient theorem proving algorithms for WHIRL and rigorous evaluation of WHIRL in controlled experiments. Some of the results of this paper have also appeared previously in preliminary form <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> . 6 Conclusions In an ideal world, one would like to integrate information from heterogeneous autonomous databases with little or no human effort. In other words, one would like data to be easily shared among databases. Unfortunately, such data sharing is difficult with current data models.

Most of the approximate matching methods proposed are domain-specific (e.g., using Soundex to match surnames), a notable exception being the Smith-Waterman edit distance adopted by Monge and Elkan [ 31 ] . <p> Most of the approximate matching methods proposed are domain-specific (e.g., using Soundex to match surnames), a notable exception being the Smith-Waterman edit distance adopted by Monge and Elkan <ref> [ 31 ] </ref> . Applying these techniques is a relatively expensive off-line process which is usually not guaranteed to find the best matches, due to the nearly universal use of "blocking" heuristics which restrict the number of similarity comparisons.

Reference-contexts: Nor are SQL operations like grouping and sorting supported. In WHIRL, finding an r-answer is viewed as an optimization problem; in particular, the query processing algorithm uses a general method called Afl search <ref> [ 33; 25 ] </ref> to find the highest-scoring r substitutions for a query. <p> most promis ing, and effectively pruning partial substitutions that cannot lead to a high scoring ground substitution. 3.2 Afl search Afl search (summarized in Figure 1) is a graph search method which attempts to find the highest scoring path between a given start state s 0 and a goal state <ref> [ 33; 25 ] </ref> . Goal states are defined by a goalState predicate. The graph being searched is defined by a function children (s), which returns the set of states directly reachable from state s.

Finally, we plan to continue our evaluation of WHIRL on actual data integration tasks [ 10 ] . These experiments allow us to evaluate WHIRL on less artificial queries, and suggest necessary extensions.

Reference-contexts: One widely used method for representing text is the vector space model <ref> [ 36 ] </ref> , which we will now briefly review. We assume a vocabulary T of terms, which will be treated as atomic; terms might include words, phrases, or word stems (morphologically derived word prefixes).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The integration of distributed, heterogeneous databases, sometimes called data integration, is an active area of research <ref> [ 14; 27; 2; 19; 40; 6 ] </ref> . <p> WHIRL also differs from such models in that it includes statistical IR methods for searching within documents, rather than boolean keyword search methods. In its basic motivation, our work is inspired by previous work in the integration of heterogeneous data sources, such as data sources on the Web <ref> [ 27; 2; 19; 3; 40; 6 ] </ref> . None of these previous systems, however, include a "fuzzy" matching procedure for names; instead they generally construct global domains using hand-crafted domain-specific normalization schemes.

Reference-contexts: Viewing query processing as search is natural, given that the goal is to find a small number of good substitutions, rather than all satisfying substitutions; the search method we use also generalizes certain techniques used in IR ranked retrieval <ref> [ 41 ] </ref> . However, using search in query processing is unusual for database systems, which more typically use search only in optimizing a query. <p> This process will continue until r documents are generated. Note that it is quite likely that low weight terms such as "or" will not be used at all. In a survey article, Turtle and Flood <ref> [ 41 ] </ref> review a number of query optimization methods for ranked retrieval IR systems. The most effective of these was one they call the maxscore optimization. <p> This might be more appropriately be called a "semi-naive" method; on each IR query, we use inverted indices, but we employ no special query optimizations. * As noted above, WHIRL is closely related to maxscore optimization <ref> [ 41 ] </ref> . We thus compared WHIRL to a maxscore method for similarity joins; this method is analogous to the naive method described above, except that the maxscore optimization is used in finding the best r results from each "primitive" query.
