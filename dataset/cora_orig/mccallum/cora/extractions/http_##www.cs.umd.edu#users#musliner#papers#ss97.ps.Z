Abstract: We are developing mixed-initiative systems that provide users with flexible control over evolving processes. For such systems to be feasible, both users and automated agents must be able to operate at multiple levels of abstraction. We are designing mixed initiative systems organized around shared task models to achieve this multi-level task sharing. These task models will allow both human and automated agents to view the ongoing state, to control tasks and to project future requirements. Our task models will have semantics, allowing a suitable interpreter to directly execute tasks for users. We discuss this approach and our initial implementation of a system that assists users in proposal preparation.

Reference-contexts: Each KA is triggered when its context is satisfied by current conditions. This encapsulation of procedures and context-dependent reactions allows both the modular structure of rule-based systems and the compound actions, subgoaling, and metalevel expressions of more powerful task representations (e.g. RAPS <ref> (Firby 1987) </ref>). The Intention Structure (IS) contains all those tasks the system has chosen for execution, either immediately or at some later time, and is under full introspective control of KAs.

Reference-contexts: Currently, a major expense in systems development is the development of user interfaces. Fur- thermore, the construction of direct manipulation interfaces requires us to develop direct manipulation metaphors, which are often strained by complex systems <ref> (Gentner & Nielson 1996) </ref>. If we can develop a satisfactory cross-domain task modeling formalism, and a user interface approach that operates on this formalism, then we will be able to amortize the costs of user interface development for even complex software systems.

Reference-contexts: Determining the presence of antibodies in blood samples is a task that people perform poorly, but that can be significantly aided by a mixed-initiative decision support system <ref> (Guerlain 1995) </ref>. Scheduling often requires consideration of more possible orderings than can be evaluated by people. In other cases, forgoing automation is no longer even an option.
