Abstract Anytime you connect motors and amplifiers to a co mputer, you make it possible for the computer to break something or hurt someone. However, careful design of hardware and software can permit full use of a device within limits imposed by safety concerns. It is trivial to cause one such device, the Phantom [ Massie and Salisbury 94] from SensAble Technologies, to damage i tself and in fact it is quite difficult not to do so. In this paper, we describe a robust solution to this problem. Protecting the PHANToM from the

Reference-contexts: Also, the use of a simple stiff wall model internally in the controller like the one used in the UNC Phantom library might be an effective alternative <ref> [Mark et al. '96] </ref>. Another way to alleviate problems with communication speed is to remove the need for high speed communication completely.

Reference-contexts: This format will provide for transmission of not only haptic object geometry but also surface properties such as friction. The controller could implement a friction model such as the one d escribed in <ref> [Zilles and Salisbury '95] </ref>. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the employees of SensAble Technologies for the quick response and support every time we broke our Phantom.
