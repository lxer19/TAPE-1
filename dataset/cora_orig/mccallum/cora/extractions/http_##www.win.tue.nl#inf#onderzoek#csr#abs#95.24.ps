Title: Solving a Time Tabling Problem by Constraint Satisfaction  
Author: F.P.M. Dignum W.P.M. Nuijten L.M.A. Janssen 
Abstract: The time tabling problem is well known and much research has been done about it. This paper shows how a difficult instance of the time tabling problem with many parameters and loose constraints can be handled using constraint satisfaction. To this end the constraints have to be modeled in a format that can be handled efficiently. It is shown how several modelling problems can be solved in a generic way and that the results are satisfactory.

Reference-contexts: Although the approach is similar to ours it appears that it is not possible to solve any large realistic problem using this method. A different approach in solving time tabling problems is the use of simulated annealing, as done by e.g. Abramson <ref> [1] </ref>. fl Eindhoven University of Technology, Department of Mathematics and Computing Science, P.O.

Some constraints can be formalized within the models, others, which are also found in many practical situations, can not.

Reference-contexts: The main characteristics of a time tabling problem are a large number of variables, a high level of complexity and a varied nature. In <ref> [4] </ref>, it is shown that all common time tabling problems are NP-complete. Due to the variety in problems most approaches differ to a large extend. A general applicable time tabling model does not exist. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare the solutions presented in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Some constraints can be formalized within the models, others, which are also found in many practical situations, can not. However, the exact models presented form a useful basis to derive heuristic methods. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Monfroglio describes a class teacher problem as a case study of the application of constraint satisfaction in a logic programming environment. Although the approach is similar to ours it appears that it is not possible to solve any large realistic problem using this method.

Reference-contexts: Besides the set of mandatory constraints, each instance of the TRCSP contains a set of additional constraints. An additional constraint is either a time constraint, restricting the start time and completion time assignments of operations, or a resource constraint, restricting the resource set assignments of operations. See <ref> [6] </ref> for a formal description of the language in which these constraints can be expressed. Here we suffice to state that the language is powerfull enough to define all possible relations between two time intervals (in which possibly two operations are processed). <p> First, the consistency is checked. Here we make use of the structure of the TRCSP to do a more extensive and efficient checking than what is done in the general CSP framework. A full description of the consistency checking can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. If a dead end is detected we first perform a chronological backtrack step.

Reference-contexts: See e.g.[6]. The second line of research investigates whether the improved performance characteristics of our constraint satisfaction algorithms also hold for problems in practical planning and scheduling situations. To this end we performed some case studies on actual instances of time tabling and production planning problems. In <ref> [7] </ref>, a first account of these studies is given. The present paper also reports on this line of the research and presents the results of the constraint satisfaction techniques, as we use them, on a real-life school time tabling problem.
