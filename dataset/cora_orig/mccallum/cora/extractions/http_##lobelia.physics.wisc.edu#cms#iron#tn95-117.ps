Abstract: The endcaps for the CMS detector are toroid-shaped steel disks 14 meters in diameter and 600mm thick. The inner hole is 2.2m in diameter. Each disk is fabricated from large 600mm thick steel blocks which are electroslag welded together. These disks will be subject to large magnetic forces up to 70 MN. The deflections and stresses caused by these forces on the RF1 disk are analyzed by a 3D finite element calculation. The result is that the maximum deflection of RF1 is 3.0mm and the maximum stress on the edge of the inner hole is 42M P a.
