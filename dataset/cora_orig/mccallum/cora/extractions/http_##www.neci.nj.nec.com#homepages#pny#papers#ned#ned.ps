Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that two common metrics, symmetric set difference, and Eu-clidian distance, have normalized forms which are nevertheless metrics. The second applies to vectors in R n and is given by kXY k=(kXk+kY k). That this is a metric is more difficult to demonstrate and is true for Euclidian distance (the L 2 norm) but for no other integral Minkowski metric. The result is a family of forms which resemble commonly used dissimilarity statistics but obey the triangle inequality.

Reference-contexts: Before doing so however, we turn our attention back to Euclidian space and our goal of establishing a normalized metric there. III. The Normalized Euclidian Metric In this section we will demonstrate that Euclidian distance normalized by combined norm, defines an alternative and <ref> [0; 1] </ref> bounded metric on R n . Definition 5 Let (R n ; d) denote Euclidian N-space (The L 2 norm and corresponding standard distance function). <p> D. Function Spaces Now corollary 1 may also be applied to function spaces. Let C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> denote the space of non-negative continuous functions on [0; 1]. Given f; g 2 C [0; 1], the metric de fined by: 1 0 min (f (x); g (x))dx 0 max (f (x); g (x))dx R 1 R 1 may be thought of as an extension of our first <p> D. Function Spaces Now corollary 1 may also be applied to function spaces. Let C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> denote the space of non-negative continuous functions on [0; 1]. Given f; g 2 C [0; 1], the metric de fined by: 1 0 min (f (x); g (x))dx 0 max (f (x); g (x))dx R 1 R 1 may be thought of as an extension of our first positive n-tuple metric above, as N ! 1, or in <p> D. Function Spaces Now corollary 1 may also be applied to function spaces. Let C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> denote the space of non-negative continuous functions on [0; 1]. Given f; g 2 C [0; 1], the metric de fined by: 1 0 min (f (x); g (x))dx 0 max (f (x); g (x))dx R 1 R 1 may be thought of as an extension of our first positive n-tuple metric above, as N ! 1, or in a Lebesgue/Measure-Space context.

Reference-contexts: (a + fl)(bc + abc) cfl + fl (ab + bc + abc + abc) + afl cfl + fl 2 + flabc + afl (ac + abc)fl + (a + c + fl)fl and we are done. 2 Our arguments for sets in F generalize easily to measure spaces <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. The case of finite non-zero measures is straightforward since these correspond well with finite sets and our earlier arguments.

Reference-contexts: Its proof will require a series of Lemmas which build insight into the function. It is worthwhile noting that in R 1 , an easy proof exists and that a very similar R 1 metric (a special case of our definition 7), is employed in <ref> [4] </ref>. We would also observe that this definition fails to generate a metric if the L 1 norm is substituted. 5 For if A = (1; 0), B = (1; 1), and C = (0; 1), the triangle inequality does not hold.

Reference-contexts: Again thinking of sets as binary vectors or variables, metric d 4 n is recognized as a well known measure of association referred to as the Jaccard coefficient <ref> [6] </ref>, or S-coefficient: b + c Where a; b; c; d refer to the standard entries in a 2-by-2 contingency (or association) table for binary variables. 8 Factor ff may be disregarded as it applies to all terms, and re-grouping the paired sums, yields a common term (a + b +

Reference-contexts: Expressing essentially the same thing as a similarity measure corresponds to the Tanimoto Coefficient, <ref> [7] </ref>, operating on binary vectors: A t B In the language of computer programming this is just the count of 1's in the exclusive or of bit vectors A and B, divided by the count of 1's in their logical or. In [8], the measure is referred to as association.
