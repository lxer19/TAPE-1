Reference-contexts: DLogTime-uniform T C 0 is a fairly natural complexity class: it is characterized by first-order logic with majority quantifiers on ordered finite models [3] in Descriptive Complexity Theory, or by acceptance in polynomial time on so-called Threshold Turing Machines <ref> [2] </ref>, or by the machine-independent characterization below, which is most convenient for our purposes. Whenever we speak of T C 0 in the following without further qualification, we mean DLogTime-uniform T C 0 .

(b) and (c) are easily proved by induction on the complexity of A. ut To prove the witnessing theorem, we formalize C 0 2 in a sequent calculus LKB that has special rules for the introduction of bounded quantifiers (see <ref> [4] </ref>). In this formalization, open-LIN D and BB b 0 are given as inference rules, which are shown in the proof below. Theorem 5. Suppose C 0 where and are cedents of b 1 -formulas in Let a be the free variables in this sequent.

Reference-contexts: We consider the theory of Bounded Arithmetic b 1 -CR that has this rule as its main axiom. This theory is related to the computational complexity class T C 0 of functions computable by constant-depth threshold circuits. We show that the theory C 0 2 of <ref> [9] </ref>, whose b 1 -definable functions are T C 0 , is 8 b 1 -conservative over b 1 -CR. Theories of Bounded Arithmetic that correspond to the complexity class T C 0 have been described earlier by the authors [9, 8] as well as by Clote and Takeuti [7]. <p> We show that the theory C 0 2 of [9], whose b 1 -definable functions are T C 0 , is 8 b 1 -conservative over b 1 -CR.

In <ref> [9] </ref>, it is proved that C 0 2 proves the b 1 -COM P axiom, therefore b 1 -CR is a subtheory of C 0 2 . But we will show that C 0 2 is not much stronger: Theorem 2.
