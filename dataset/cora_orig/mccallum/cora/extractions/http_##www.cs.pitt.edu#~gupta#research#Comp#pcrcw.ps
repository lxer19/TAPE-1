Abstract: Optical interconnection networks have the potential of transmitting data much faster than the speed at which this data can be generated at the transmitting nodes or consumed at the receiving nodes. Even when the communication protocols are simplified and most of the protocol signaling at the end nodes is done in hardware, the data cannot be processed at the end nodes at a rate faster than the rate of memory operations. We study the effect of multiplexing the network on both its throughput and latency for different ratios of memory to link transmission speeds. We found that multiplexing reduces the impact of the gap between data transmission and data generation/consumption speeds.

Reference-contexts: For example, Figure 1 (b) shows the two states that the 3 fi 3 switch attached to processor 2 must realize for the establishment of the connections shown in Figure 1 (a). Note that each switch is an electro-optical switch (T i : LiN bO 3 switch, for example <ref> [1] </ref>) which connects optical inputs to optical outputs without optical/electronic conversion. The state of the switch is controlled by an electronic signal. There are two main advantages for optical TDM networks.

Reference-contexts: Time division multiplexing can be fetched from (or stored into) memory in 40ns, the end nodes can have 1.6Gb/s data generation/consumption rate, while optical network with bandwidth of 250Gb/s have been demonstrated <ref> [2] </ref>.

The cost of control is amortized over the number of co-existing connections, thus reducing the control overhead. This effect was studied in <ref> [4] </ref>, where TDM was shown to reduce the impact of the gap between data transmission and control network speeds. <p> We conducted extensive simulations to study the effect of the memory speed on the communication performance of TDM systems. This section presents some sample results of our study. We simulated random communications on a 16 fi 16 torus network which uses the conservative backward reservation protocol <ref> [4] </ref> for the dynamic reservation of all-optical paths. To support this protocol, a shadow control network, which has the same topology as the optical data network, is needed. <p> We modified the simulation package described in details in <ref> [4] </ref> to account for memory speed, and we studied the effect of the link to memory speed ratio on the efficiency of the communication. In the simulation, during each time slot, a message is generated at each node with a fixed probability, r. <p> That is, when K increases, E channel causes the delay to decrease while E duration causes the delay to increase. Because of the two opposing effects, the minimum delay is obtained at a certain multiplexing degree, K opt , which depends on many factors (see <ref> [4] </ref>).
