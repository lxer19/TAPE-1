Abstract: Advances in imaging technology allow clinicians to view internal structures of the body in a non-invasive manner. Segmentation is an important step in most medical applications which use sampled data. Objects are irregularly shaped, vary widely in pixel value, and have blurry boundaries. Sampling may introduce artifacts consisting of speckled noise and sizable areas of noise resulting from undersampling. Currently used methods either require considerable user interaction or parameters that are difficult to set. In this paper we employ a biologically plausible oscillator model called LEGION (Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Network). We abstract an algorithm from its dynamics and segment CT and MRI datasets of two and three dimensions. The algorithm is simple and robust to sampling artifacts.

Reference-contexts: In addition, artifacts such as salt & pepper noise or undersampled objects may show up as noisy areas. Segmentation methods in use today have many drawbacks. Methods based on thresholds, histograms, or seeded region growing <ref> [1, 2] </ref> are simple but require much user interaction and preprocessing to handle artifacts. Methods such as random field and fuzzy sets [2, 3] require little user interaction and handle artifacts better but are computationally intensive, difficult to use, and not readily scalable to volume data.

Reference-contexts: Recent experiments support this assertion with evidence of oscillations in the range 40 - 60Hz and synchronization (phase-locking with zero phase shift) between spatially separate neural groups. It has been recently shown that an oscillator network model called LEGION <ref> [4] </ref> can rapidly synchronize oscillator groups that represent an object and desynchronize oscillator groups representing different objects. The model has been shown to successfully segment multiple objects in network simulations [4, 5]. <p> It has been recently shown that an oscillator network model called LEGION [4] can rapidly synchronize oscillator groups that represent an object and desynchronize oscillator groups representing different objects.

Positive input (I &gt; 0) produces oscillations, as just described. Local coupling synchronizes connected oscillators. <p> Positive input (I &gt; 0) produces oscillations, as just described. Local coupling synchronizes connected oscillators. Two oscillators are synchronized if they jump up and down simultaneously. Terman and Wang <ref> [4] </ref> show that synchronization occurs over groups of connected oscillators at an exponential rate. The global inhibitor separates different synchronized groups with a selective gating mechanism by allowing only one group into the active phase at a time.
