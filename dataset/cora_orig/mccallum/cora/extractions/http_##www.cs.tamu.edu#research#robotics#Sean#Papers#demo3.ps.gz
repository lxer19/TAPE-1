Reference-contexts: Once the operator is confident the plug is aligned, the position clutch is disengaged and the robot traverses a linearly interpolated path to the current point in the simulation. The clutch control panel is described in Section 2.2.1, and a complete description of the position clutch is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Next, force control is enabled for the Z-axis and all the rotational axes (roll, pitch, and yaw). A Z-axis force of -2.0 lbs. is set and all moment values are set to zero. <p> The allows an operator to complete a task quickly rather that waiting for a slower robot to finish each move before going on to the next. The clutch control panel is described in Section 2.2.1, and a complete description of the time clutch is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Initially, an operator position the robot camera over any one of the four target graticules on the test pattern. The operator engages the time clutch (factor 2, 4, or 8) and repeatedly moves through the pattern from graticule to graticule.
