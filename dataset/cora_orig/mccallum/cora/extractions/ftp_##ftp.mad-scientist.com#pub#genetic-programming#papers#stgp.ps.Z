Abstract: BBN Technical Report #7866: Abstract Genetic programming is a powerful method for automatically generating computer programs via the process of natural selection [Koza 92]. However, it has the limitation known as "closure", i.e. that all the variables, constants, arguments for functions, and values returned from functions must be of the same data type. To correct this deficiency, we introduce a variation of genetic programming called "strongly typed" genetic programming (STGP). In STGP, variables, constants, arguments, and returned values can be of any data type with the provision that the data type for each such value be specified beforehand. This allows the initialization process and the genetic operators to only generate parse trees such that the arguments of each function in each tree have the required types. An extension to STGP which makes it easier to use is the concept of generic functions, which are not true strongly typed functions but rather templates for classes of such functions. To illustrate STGP, we present three examples involving vector and matrix manipulation: (1) a basis representation problem (which can be constructed to be deceptive by any reasonable definition of "deception"), (2) the n-dimensional least-squares regression problem, and (3) preliminary work on the Kalman filter.

Reference-contexts: They have been shown to be capable of finding nearly global optima in large and complex spaces in a relatively short time. Acccording to <ref> [Davis 87] </ref>, a genetic algorithm has five basic components: 1 1. A representation scheme provides a way to code possible solutions to a problem in a form that is readily manipulable by the genetic operators.

Reference-contexts: This seemingly minor change makes the problem "deceptive" by any reasonable definition of this term for a tree-based genetic algorithm. For genetic algorithms based on fixed-length strings, <ref> [Goldberg 87] </ref> defines a deceptive problem as one where the lower-order schema give information which lead the search away from the optimal solution.

Reference-contexts: It uses a genetic algorithm to search through a space of possible computer programs for one which is nearly optimal in its ability to perform a particular task. In Section 1.1 we give a very brief overview of genetic algorithms (the unindoctrinated reader is referred to <ref> [Goldberg 89] </ref> as an introduction). In Section 1.2 we discuss how genetic programming differs from a standard genetic algorithm. 1.1 Genetic Algorithms Genetic algorithms are a class of algorithms for optimization and learning based on the principles of natural evolution.
