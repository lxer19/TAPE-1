Abstract: We determine the asymptotically optimal compressor function for a multidimensional compander when the source is memoryless. Under certain technical assumptions on the compressor function, it is shown that the best k-dimensional compressor function consists of the best scalar compressor functions for each component of the source vector. The mean-squared error of optimal multidimensional companding is compared to that of optimal vector quantization and optimal scalar companding.

Reference-contexts: 1 In <ref> [2] </ref>, G (f) did not contain v (f (&lt; k )) 2=k , because it was assumed that f (&lt; k ) = (0; 1) k . 2 That is, the sum of squares of the matrix elements. 2 An outline of the paper is the following. <p> As a result, we see that companding cannot simultaneously achieve L pt = 1 and L ob = 1 and therefore cannot achieve the performance of optimal VQ, which agrees with Bucklew's analysis <ref> [2] </ref>. In fact the best compressor f fl , presented in Proposition 1, is a compromise which yields a compander with L pt &gt; 1 and L ob &gt; 1.

Reference-contexts: III Comparison to Optimal Vector Quantization It is interesting to compare the MSE of an arbitrary compander, given by (1), to the asymptotic form of ffi fl k (N ), the MSE of optimal vector quantization. Zador [14] and Gersho <ref> [5] </ref> showed that for large N , ffi fl m fl N 2=k kpk k=(k+2) ; under the assumption that optimal VQ has cells that are congruent to the tesselating polytope with least NMI, m fl k , in k dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we require that the derivative matrix of f be positive definite to ensure the convexity of H (f ) and so that the appropriately chosen subclass of C is convex. As an aside, we note that in the scalar case, Gish and Pierce <ref> [7] </ref> derived the optimal compressor function using variational techniques, and subsequently Gray and Gray [8] presented a different proof using Holder's Inequality. However, we have not been able to develop a proof using Holder's Inequality for the multidimensional case.
