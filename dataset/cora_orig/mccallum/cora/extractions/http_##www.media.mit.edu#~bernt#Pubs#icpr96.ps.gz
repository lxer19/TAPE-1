Title: Probabilistic Object Recognition using Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms

Abstract: This paper describes a probabilistic object recognition technique which does not require correspondence matching of images. This technique is an extension of our earlier work on object recognition using matching of multi-dimensional receptive field histograms. In [4] we have shown that multidimensional receptive field histograms can be matched to provide object recognition which is robust in the face of changes in viewing position and independent of image plane rotation and scale. In this paper we extend this method to compute the probability of the presence of an object in an image. The paper begins with a review of the method and previously presented experimental results. We then extend the method for histogram matching to obtain a genuine probability of the presence of an object. We present experimental results on a database of 100 objects showing that the approach is capable recognizing all objects correctly by using only a small portion of the image. Our results show that receptive field histograms provide a technique for object recognition which is robust, has low computational cost and a computational complexity which is linear with the number of pixels.

The following section 3 describes receptive field functions based on the Gaussian derivatives. In [4] we introduced different measurements for the comparison of histograms.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In <ref> [4] </ref> we presented a technique to determine the identity of an object in a scene using multidimensional histograms of a vector of local neighborhood operators. We showed that this technique can be used to determine the most probable object, independent of the object's position, image-plane orientation and scale. <p> Therefore we use equivariant local characteristics which allow us to select an arbitrary scale and rotation (see e.g. [2, 1, 3]) (we use also some rotationally invariant filters which should be equivariant to scale-changes). The following section 3 describes receptive field functions based on the Gaussian derivatives. In <ref> [4] </ref> we introduced different measurements for the comparison of histograms. We identified the 2 -test as the most suitable for histogram matching. In section 4 we develop a technique to determine the probability of an object in a scene only based on multidimensional receptive field histograms. <p> Local Characteristics The calculation of local properties can be divided into the local linear point-spread function, and the normalization function used during measurements of local properties. We have found energy normalization (section 3.2) to be the most robust in the presence of additive Gaussian noise <ref> [4] </ref>. As stated in above, it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this paper we are only using filters which are based on equivariant Gaussian derivatives. We should mention that the approach can be used with any receptive field function (see [4] for further receptive <p> additive Gaussian noise <ref> [4] </ref>. As stated in above, it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this paper we are only using filters which are based on equivariant Gaussian derivatives. We should mention that the approach can be used with any receptive field function (see [4] for further receptive field functions as i.e. Gabor filter). 3.1. Local Characteristics based on Gaus sian derivatives By using the Gaussian derivatives one can explicitly select the scale. This is achieved by adapting the variance of the derivative. <p> Normalization should be considered from at least two points of view. The first point concerns how well the normalized convolution behaves in the presence of additive noise (see experiments in <ref> [4] </ref>). The second point concerns how the normalized convolution responds to variations in signal intensity due to differences in ambient light intensity, aperture setting or digitizer gain. We have compared the robustness of no normalization to three forms of normalization: Normalization by MaxMin, Normalization by Energy and Normalization by Variance [4]. <p> <ref> [4] </ref>). The second point concerns how the normalized convolution responds to variations in signal intensity due to differences in ambient light intensity, aperture setting or digitizer gain. We have compared the robustness of no normalization to three forms of normalization: Normalization by MaxMin, Normalization by Energy and Normalization by Variance [4]. We found that the Energy normalization (formula (2)) gives the most robust results in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. In the experiments described below we achieve quite satisfactory results with this normalization.

Reference-contexts: We have found that this technique presents a fast and robust method to determine if a specified object is present in an image of a scene. The method is not restricted to a particular family of filters but can be used with a large scale of different filters. In <ref> [5] </ref> we evaluated the robustness of the approach to view point changes. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach is robust to such changes. <p> We identified the 2 -test as the most suitable for histogram matching. In section 4 we develop a technique to determine the probability of an object in a scene only based on multidimensional receptive field histograms. The design parameters of the histograms determine the separability between different objects. In <ref> [5] </ref> we concluded that reducing of the resolution (number of bins per histogram axis) results in an improvement of the stability of the histograms with respect to view point changes and image-plane rotation, but also diminishes the discrimination between objects.

Reference-contexts: Using this technique the probability of each object can be calculated only based on the multidimensional receptive field histograms of each object (see section 4).

Multidimensional Receptive Field His tograms Swain and Ballard <ref> [6] </ref> have developed a technique which identifies objects in an image by matching a color histogram from a region of the image with a color histogram from a sample of the object.
