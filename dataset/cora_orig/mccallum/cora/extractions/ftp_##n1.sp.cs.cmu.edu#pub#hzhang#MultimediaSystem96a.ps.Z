Abstract: To support emerging real-time applications, high speed integrated services networks need to provide end-to-end performance guarantees on a per-connection basis in a networking environment. In addition to the issue of how to allocate resources to meet diverse QOS requirements in a single switch, resource management algorithms also need to account for the fact that traffic may get burstier and burstier as it traverses the network due to complex interaction among packet streams at each switch. To address this problem, several non-work-conservingpacket service disciplines have been proposed. A non-work-conserving server is one that may be idle even when there are packets available to be sent. By holding packets under certain conditions, non-work-conserving servers fully or partially reconstruct the traffic pattern of the original source inside the network, and prevents the traffic from becoming burstier. In this paper, we compare two non-work-conserving service disciplines: Stop-and-Go and Rate-Controlled Static Priority or RCSP. Stop-and-Go uses a multi-level framing strategy to allocate resources in a single switch and to ensure traffic smoothness throughout the network. RCSP decouples the server functions by having two components: a regulator to control traffic distortion introduced by multiplexing effects and load fluctuations in previous servers, and a static priority scheduler to multiplex the regulated traffic. We compare the two service disciplines in terms of traffic specification, scheduling mechanism, buffer space requirement, end-to-end delay characteristics, connection admission control algorithms, and achievable network utilization. The comparison is first done analytically, and then empirically by using two 10-minute traces of MPEG compressed video.

Reference-contexts: In fact, even early implementations of commercial ATM switches have at least two priority levels <ref> [2] </ref>. Experimental ATM switches have more priority levels. The queue module in the Xunet-2 [8] switch supports 16 priority levels [14].

Reference-contexts: Eligibility times for packets from different connections are computed using the same formula with different parameters; holding packets is equivalent to managing a set of timers. One mechanism for managing timers is the calendar queue <ref> [3] </ref>. Figure 8 (b) shows an example implementation of RCSP based on a modified version of a calendar queue. A calendar queue consists of a clock and a calendar, which is a pointer array indexed by time.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to characterize the traffic pattern distortion inside the network, and derive the traffic characterization at the entrance to each switch from characterizations of the source traffic and of the traffic pattern distortions <ref> [1, 4, 19, 25] </ref>. In general, characterizing traffic inside the network is difficult. In networks with work-conserving service disciplines, even in situations when the traffic inside the network can be characterized, the worst-case traffic is usually more bursty inside the network than that at the entrance. <p> In networks with work-conserving service disciplines, even in situations when the traffic inside the network can be characterized, the worst-case traffic is usually more bursty inside the network than that at the entrance. This property is independent of the traffic model being used. In <ref> [4] </ref>, a deterministic fluid model (; ) is used to characterize a traffic source. A source is said to satisfy (; ) if during any time interval of length u, the amount of its output traffic is less than + u. <p> However, the RCSP algorithm is general and other traffic characterization can be used. For example, the (; ) model proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> may be used. In this case, RCSP's regulators are simply leaky buckets. Additionally, if a more elaborate Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) model is used [18], the flexibility offered by RCSP allows the admission control algorithm to accept additional connections. <p> Since the frame size is also the local delay bound, the coupling between the traffic specification and the delay allocation implies that the admission control algorithm has to be based on a busy period argument, which tends out to produce looser bounds when compared to more elaborate analysis <ref> [4, 33] </ref>. This will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. Because of the framing, there are dependencies among the local delay bounds at each priority level in a Stop-and-Go server. <p> Different service disciplines have different corresponding admission control conditions. In this section, we first review the admission control conditions of Stop-and-Go and RCSP. We then compare the conditions by using deterministic fluid model analysis developed in <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.1 Stop-and-Go In Stop-and-Go, the connection admission control algorithm needs to ensure that packets from an incoming frame of an input link will always go out on the next departing frame of the output link. The following theorem gives the condition. <p> m , where d m = maxfu : u 0; b 0 m (u) l fi ug and b 0 m (ff) is defined for all ff by b 0 fi0 fSmax + X b m;j (fi) + q=1 j2C q The proof is by extension of the results of <ref> [4] </ref>. Details may also be found in [31]. The end-to-end delay of a packet consists of the link delays the packet experienced and the residence times of the packet in each of the switches along the path. <p> The difference between the two curves is the number of bits currently in the queue, or the backlog function. When the backlog function returns to zero (the two curves meet) there are no bits in the queue and thus a busy period has ended. Two key observations follow <ref> [4] </ref>: * the maximum busy period provides an upper bound on delay for any work-conserving server; 12 * the maximum backlog divided by link speed provides an upper bound on delay for a FCFS server. <p> Delay bounds for other policies can also be expressed as the function of the two curves <ref> [1, 4, 17, 24] </ref>. The admission control criteria of Stop-and-Go relies on a bound on the busy period.

Reference-contexts: Queueing analysis is also difficult to apply to this problem since it is often intractable for realistic traffic models. Moreover, classical queueing analyses usually study average performance for aggregate traffic [16] in integrated-services networks, performance bounds need to be derived on a per-connection basis <ref> [6, 20] </ref>. In addition to the challenge of providing end-to-end per-connection performance guarantees to heterogeneous, bursty traffic sources, service disciplines must be simple enough to be implemented at very high speeds. A service discipline can be classified as either work-conserving or non-work-conserving.

Reference-contexts: It has been argued that a connection- oriented architecture with explicit resource allocation and connection admission control is needed to offer such a real-time service <ref> [7] </ref>. In a packet-switching network, packets from different connections will interact with each other at each multiplexing point. Without proper control, these interactions may adversely affect the network performance experienced by clients. <p> Finally, in Sections 6, Section 7, and 8 we respectively examine implementation issues, review related work, and conclude. 2 Background In order to provide end-to-end performance guarantees on a per connection basis, a connection-oriented and reservation- based architecture is needed <ref> [7] </ref>. In such an architecture, there are two phases in a communication session: connection establishment and data transfer. During the connection establishment, the client first specifies its end-to-end traffic and performance parameters to the network. <p> A stream of packets is called (r; T )-smooth if during each frame of length T the total number of bits that are transmitted by the source is no more than r T bits. In the original proposal of RCSP [32], the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model was used <ref> [7] </ref>. In this model, Xmin is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, Xave is the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval I, and Smax is the maximum packet size. However, the RCSP algorithm is general and other traffic characterization can be used. <p> is used, and the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) traffic model is adopted, the amount of buffer space required at the i th switch along the path traversed by the connection is d h=1 d h Xmin eSmax, where d h is the local delay bound at the h th switch <ref> [7, 36] </ref>. Stop-and-Go and RCSP require less buffer space not only inside the network, but also at the destination node. <p> For RCSP, as noted in Section 4, a tighter source model can result in more accepted connections and thus higher network utilization. For this reason, for RCSP we investigate the maximum number of connections that can be accepted for both the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model of <ref> [7] </ref> as well as the tighter D- BIND model of [18]. <p> Besides exact service disciplines, a number of analytical models have also been proposed to study non-work-conserving policies, for example, the affine server in [21] and the AIRPORT server in [5]. 19 Among the work-conserving disciplines proposed are: Virtual Clock [37], variations of the Earliest-Due-Date algorithms <ref> [7, 15] </ref>, and Generalized Processor Sharing [24]. All of them use a sorted priority queue mechanism [36], which makes it difficult to implement in high-speed switches.

The queue module in the Xunet-2 <ref> [8] </ref> switch supports 16 priority levels [14]. One important difference between Stop-and-Go and RCSP is that RCSP requires the computation of the eligibility time to be performed on a per packet basis while Stop-and-Go needs only per frame processing. Regardless, rate control in RCSP may still be feasible.

Reference-contexts: With P and B frames, higher compression ratios can be achieved since the interframe coding makes use of motion compensation techniques. More details of the MPEG algorithm may be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. It is assumed that the entire frame is transmitted per frame time (as opposed to introducing additional delay by smoothing over several frames) so that Figure 6 is shows the frame sizes multipled by the frame rate (30 fps).

Reference-contexts: Recent studies suggest that non-work-conserving disciplines have some unique characteristics that make them suitable for providing performance guarantees in packet switching networks [34, 36]. In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go <ref> [10] </ref> and Rate-Controlled Static Priority or RCSP [32]. Although both Stop-and-Go and RCSP can be used to provide statistical guarantees [12, 35], only deterministic performance guarantees are considered in this paper. The remainder of the paper is organized as the follows. <p> Additionally, if a more elaborate Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) model is used [18], the flexibility offered by RCSP allows the admission control algorithm to accept additional connections. This will be demonstrated in Section 5 using real traffic traces. 3.2 Stop-and-Go Stop-and-Go uses a framing strategy <ref> [10] </ref>. In such a strategy, the time axis is divided into frames, which are periods of some constant length T . Stop-and-Go defines departing and arriving frames for each link.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that low delay bound and fine granularity of bandwidth allocation cannot be achieved simultaneously in a framing strategy like Stop-and-Go. To get around this coupling problem, a generalized version of Stop-and-Go with multiple frame sizes is proposed <ref> [11] </ref>. In the generalized Stop-and-Go, the time axis is divided into a hierarchical framing structure as shown in Figure 2. <p> In particular, T m+1 = K m T m must hold, with 1 m &lt; n, and K m being an integer. In addition, the delay bound allocations for each connection in different switches are coupled with one another. In <ref> [11] </ref>, a connection has to have the same frame size in all the switches. In [36], a looser requirement is presented: the frame times of a connection along the path should be non-decreasing. None of these restrictions apply to RCSP. <p> size of Smax, any packet arriving in a T m frame of an incoming link will be serviced before the end 10 of the next T m frame of the output link if m X X r j T m + Smax lT m : (5) The proof is in <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> The proof is given in <ref> [11] </ref>. 4.2 RCSP In RCSP, the admission control algorithm needs to ensure that local delay bounds can be guaranteed for each connection at the scheduler. In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each guaranteed performance connection traversing the server.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go [10] and Rate-Controlled Static Priority or RCSP [32]. Although both Stop-and-Go and RCSP can be used to provide statistical guarantees <ref> [12, 35] </ref>, only deterministic performance guarantees are considered in this paper. The remainder of the paper is organized as the follows. We first discuss the background and motivate the need for 2 non-work-conserving disciplines in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: In [29], another rate-controlled discipline is proposed with a First-Come-First-Served scheduler. Though much simpler than EDD, a FCFS scheduler provides only one delay bound and thus cannot efficiently support the diverse QOS requirement in the future integrated services networks. Hierarchical Round Robin <ref> [13] </ref> is a service discipline that also uses a multi-level framing strategy. It differs from Stop-and-Go in that it does not use synchronized framing structure across links, thus it cannot provide tight end-to-end delay-jitter bounds.

Reference-contexts: Different bounding traffic models such as (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax), D-BIND, and (; ) have different corresponding traffic constraint functions (see <ref> [17] </ref>). Theorem 3 Consider a Static Priority scheduler with n priority levels.

Reference-contexts: However, the RCSP algorithm is general and other traffic characterization can be used. For example, the (; ) model proposed in [4] may be used. In this case, RCSP's regulators are simply leaky buckets. Additionally, if a more elaborate Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) model is used <ref> [18] </ref>, the flexibility offered by RCSP allows the admission control algorithm to accept additional connections. This will be demonstrated in Section 5 using real traffic traces. 3.2 Stop-and-Go Stop-and-Go uses a framing strategy [10]. <p> This proposition is more general than Proposition 1. It applies to any traffic specification, rather than just (r; T ) smoothness. In the original discussion of RCSP [32], the traffic model (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) is used. In <ref> [18] </ref>, a more accurate D-BIND model is proposed. We will show in Section 5 that RCSP's flexibility of allowing the use of more accurate traffic models will increase the number of connections that can be admitted into the network. The second component of an RCSP server is the scheduler. <p> In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each guaranteed performance connection traversing the server. As mentioned in Section 3.3, many traffic models can be used. In [32, 33], admission control conditions were given for the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model and in <ref> [18] </ref> for the D-BIND model. The following theorem gives the algorithm control condition for RCSP using a general traffic constraint function b (), where b j (u) is defined to be the maximum number of bits that can arrive on connection j during any interval of length u. <p> For this reason, for RCSP we investigate the maximum number of connections that can be accepted for both the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model of [7] as well as the tighter D- BIND model of <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> Also, not shown is the fact that a peak-rate allocation scheme would result in 29 connections accepted. The ratio of the number of accepted connections to 29 what is termed in <ref> [18] </ref> as the Deterministic Multiplexing Gain (DMG). That is, even though all packets are deterministically guaranteed to meet their loss and delay bounds, sources may be multiplexed beyond their peak rate. For the RCSP/D-BIND curve, even for small delay bounds, DMG's significantly greater than 1 are achievable. <p> The reason for this is that the intense action and colors of the advertisement sequence results in a very bursty deterministic traffic specification (see <ref> [18] </ref> for further details). Thus, this source is more difficult to multiplex allowing approximately a 33% increase over a peak rate reservation scheme. 6 Implementation Issues To implement Stop-and-Go, mechanisms are needed at both the link level and at the queue management level.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to characterize the traffic pattern distortion inside the network, and derive the traffic characterization at the entrance to each switch from characterizations of the source traffic and of the traffic pattern distortions <ref> [1, 4, 19, 25] </ref>. In general, characterizing traffic inside the network is difficult. In networks with work-conserving service disciplines, even in situations when the traffic inside the network can be characterized, the worst-case traffic is usually more bursty inside the network than that at the entrance. <p> Compared to the characterization of the source traffic, the maximum burst size at the i th switch increases by P i1 h=1 j d h;j . This maximum burst size grows monotonically along the path of the connection. In <ref> [19] </ref>, a family of stochastic random variables is used to characterize a source.

Reference-contexts: The operations are all constant-time ones: array indexing, insertion at the tail of a linked list, deletion from the head of a linked list. Another implementation based on two-dimensional shifters is proposed in <ref> [22] </ref>. 18 Both Stop-and-Go and RCSP need a mechanism to service packets according to a non-preemptive static priority policy, which is easy to implement in high speed switches. In fact, even early implementations of commercial ATM switches have at least two priority levels [2].

The admission control criteria of Stop-and-Go relies on a bound on the busy period. <p> exact service disciplines, a number of analytical models have also been proposed to study non-work-conserving policies, for example, the affine server in [21] and the AIRPORT server in [5]. 19 Among the work-conserving disciplines proposed are: Virtual Clock [37], variations of the Earliest-Due-Date algorithms [7, 15], and Generalized Processor Sharing <ref> [24] </ref>. All of them use a sorted priority queue mechanism [36], which makes it difficult to implement in high-speed switches. Also, in a network with work-conserving disciplines, more resources such as buffer space are needed in downstream switches due to traffic pattern distortions inside the network.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to characterize the traffic pattern distortion inside the network, and derive the traffic characterization at the entrance to each switch from characterizations of the source traffic and of the traffic pattern distortions <ref> [1, 4, 19, 25] </ref>. In general, characterizing traffic inside the network is difficult. In networks with work-conserving service disciplines, even in situations when the traffic inside the network can be characterized, the worst-case traffic is usually more bursty inside the network than that at the entrance.

Reference-contexts: However, results from these studies are not directly applicable to integrated-services networks for the following reasons. Analyses of hard real-time systems usually assume a single server environment, periodic jobs, and the job delay bounded by its period <ref> [27] </ref>. However, network traffic is bursty, and the delay constraint for each individual connection is independent of its bandwidth requirement. In addition, bounds on end-to-end performance need to be guaranteed in a networking environment, where traffic dynamics are far more complex than in a single server environment.

Reference-contexts: For example, Jitter-EDD provides per-connection end-to-end delay and delay- jitter bounds and allows the buffer space requirements to be uniformly distributed across the network. However, it is unclear how to implement an EDD scheduler efficiently at high speeds. In <ref> [29] </ref>, another rate-controlled discipline is proposed with a First-Come-First-Served scheduler. Though much simpler than EDD, a FCFS scheduler provides only one delay bound and thus cannot efficiently support the diverse QOS requirement in the future integrated services networks.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies suggest that non-work-conserving disciplines have some unique characteristics that make them suitable for providing performance guarantees in packet switching networks [34, 36]. In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go [10] and Rate-Controlled Static Priority or RCSP <ref> [32] </ref>. Although both Stop-and-Go and RCSP can be used to provide statistical guarantees [12, 35], only deterministic performance guarantees are considered in this paper. The remainder of the paper is organized as the follows. We first discuss the background and motivate the need for 2 non-work-conserving disciplines in Section 2. <p> A stream of packets is called (r; T )-smooth if during each frame of length T the total number of bits that are transmitted by the source is no more than r T bits. In the original proposal of RCSP <ref> [32] </ref>, the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model was used [7]. In this model, Xmin is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, Xave is the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval I, and Smax is the maximum packet size. <p> However, the coupling between delay and service quantum still exists within each 6 frame. 3.3 Rate-Controlled Static-Priority A Rate-Controlled Static-Priority server differs from a Stop-and-Go server in that it uses two components to allocate delay bounds and bandwidth instead of one framing structure <ref> [32] </ref>. These two components are a rate controller and a static-priority scheduler. The rate controller shapes the input traffic from each connection into the desired traffic pattern by assigning an eligibility time to each packet. The scheduler then orders the transmission of eligible packets from all the connections. <p> This proposition is more general than Proposition 1. It applies to any traffic specification, rather than just (r; T ) smoothness. In the original discussion of RCSP <ref> [32] </ref>, the traffic model (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) is used. In [18], a more accurate D-BIND model is proposed. We will show in Section 5 that RCSP's flexibility of allowing the use of more accurate traffic models will increase the number of connections that can be admitted into the network. <p> In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each guaranteed performance connection traversing the server. As mentioned in Section 3.3, many traffic models can be used. In <ref> [32, 33] </ref>, admission control conditions were given for the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model and in [18] for the D-BIND model.

Reference-contexts: Since the frame size is also the local delay bound, the coupling between the traffic specification and the delay allocation implies that the admission control algorithm has to be based on a busy period argument, which tends out to produce looser bounds when compared to more elaborate analysis <ref> [4, 33] </ref>. This will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. Because of the framing, there are dependencies among the local delay bounds at each priority level in a Stop-and-Go server. <p> In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each guaranteed performance connection traversing the server. As mentioned in Section 3.3, many traffic models can be used. In <ref> [32, 33] </ref>, admission control conditions were given for the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model and in [18] for the D-BIND model. <p> That is, for the SG calculations, we allow the admission control algorithm to choose the optimal value of I (Xave and r should be viewed as functions of I). Thus, the RCSP/Xmin curve uses the bound in <ref> [33] </ref>. Once again, as the delay bound increases, so does the number of connections accepted until the point of scheduler saturation. The maximum DMG for this traffic specification and scheduler is 2.41 achieved at a queueing delay bound of 58 msec.

Reference-contexts: With a non-work-conserving discipline, the server may be idle even when there are packets waiting for transmission. Recent studies suggest that non-work-conserving disciplines have some unique characteristics that make them suitable for providing performance guarantees in packet switching networks <ref> [34, 36] </ref>. In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go [10] and Rate-Controlled Static Priority or RCSP [32]. <p> Also, these disciplines can provide end-to-end performance guarantees in networks of arbitrary topology. 3 Stop-and-Go and RCSP Service Disciplines In this section, we review the traffic models used in Stop-and-Go and RCSP, and then describe and compare each discipline by casting them into the same framework of rate-controlled service disciplines <ref> [34] </ref>. 3.1 Traffic Model In order to allocate resources for each connection, sources must specify their traffic characteristics. In the literature, different traffic models have been used for different schedulers. For example, Stop-and-Go uses the (r; T ) traffic 4 model. <p> By maintaining traffic smoothness throughout the network, end-to-end delay bounds can be guaranteed in a network of arbitrary topology as long as each server can ensure local delay bounds for (r; T ) smooth traffic. As discussed in <ref> [34] </ref>, one of the most important advantages of non-work-conserving disciplines like Stop-and-Go is that they greatly simplify the analysis in a networking environment by allowing a single node analysis to be extended to networks of arbitrary topology. <p> Alternatively, RCSP decouples the two functions by using two components, a rate-controller and a scheduler. In this section, we discuss the implications and tradeoffs of this important difference. As shown in <ref> [34] </ref>, both Stop-and-Go and RCSP belong to a class of non-work-conserving disciplines called rate-controlled service disciplines. A rate-controlled server has two components: a rate-controller and a scheduler. Combinations of different rate-controllers and schedulers result in different rate-controlled disciplines. <p> The residence time of a packet in a switch with rate-controlled servers has two components: the holding time in the regulator and the waiting time in the scheduler. Theorem 3 only bounds the waiting time in the scheduler. The next theorem, proven in <ref> [34] </ref>, states that the end-to-end delays of all the packets on a connection can be bounded, as long as the delays on the links and the delays at each of the schedulers can be bounded. <p> eligibility time of a packet based on the eligibility time of the same packet in the previous server as done in delay-jitter controlling regulators, rate-jitter controlling regulators calculate the eligibility time of a packet based on the eligibility times of packets arriving earlier at the server on the same connection <ref> [34] </ref>, therefore, time-stamping packets at each switch are not needed.

In [11], a connection has to have the same frame size in all the switches.
