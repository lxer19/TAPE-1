Title: Bounds on the Greedy Routing Algorithm for Array Networks

Abstract: We analyze the performance of greedy routing for array networks by providing bounds on the average delay and the average number of packets in the system for the dynamic routing problem. In this model packets are generated at each node according to a Poisson process, and each packet is sent to a destination chosen uniformly at random. Our bounds are based on comparisons with computationally simpler queueing networks, and the methods used are generally applicable to other network systems. A primary contribution of the paper is a new lower bound technique that also improves on the previous lower bounds by Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis for heavily loaded hypercube networks. On heavily loaded array networks, our lower and upper bounds differ by only a small constant factor. We further examine extensions of the problem where our methods prove useful. For example, we consider variations where edges can have different transmission rates or the destination distribution is non-uniform. In particular, we study to what extent optimally configured array networks outperform the standard array network.

Reference-contexts: Here, we deviate from their methods and demonstrate a stronger lower bound technique also based on comparisons that is both powerful and easily generalizable. Recently, this problem has been studied using the Jack-son open queueing network model in <ref> [1] </ref>.

This follows from a sequence of standard results from queueing theory [4, 6, 14]. This model was recently examined by Harchol-Balter and Black to approximate greedy routing behavior <ref> [1] </ref>. We can interpret our result as saying that for the array, the Jackson model provides an upper bound on the average lifetime of a packet in the system for the standard (unit-time transmission) model.

As described in [1] and noted as far back as [7], the arrival rates at a queue edge can be easily determined combinatorially. <p> The methods presented here easily extend to array networks in higher dimensions under the greedy routing paradigm. The derivation seems relatively straightforward; one can explicitly determine the arrival rates at individual queues com-binatorially or by solving a large system of equations, as described in <ref> [1] </ref>. Finally, the results here also hold asymptotically for slotted time, where the time axis is not continuous but instead consists of slots of some fixed duration o .

Reference-contexts: His derivations also yield results for first-in first-out (FIFO) service, but only at low arrival rates. Recently, similar work improving on the combinatorial analysis has been done by Kahale and Leighton <ref> [3] </ref>. Primarily we follow a different method of analysis based on the work of Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis in [12], which uses comparison methods. Such methods have been used for other stochastic models, but primarily for single queues. Some examples of various applications can be found in [13]. <p> Interestingly, in heavily loaded networks assuming independence overestimates T , suggesting that the dependence inherent in the network actually helps performance. This suggestion has recently been borne out by the work of Kahale and Leighton in <ref> [3] </ref>. They show that the average delay T , for a fixed ae, is at most some constant greater than n, the average distance a packet travels. The approximation for T above yields that the difference between T and n is linear in n for a fixed ae.

Reference-contexts: In effect, we simply assume initially that all queues are independent; this type of idea seems to have first been considered by Kleinrock as far back as in <ref> [5] </ref>. Of course this assumption is unwarranted, but in practice, it proves accurate in many situations. Moreover, this approximation will provide a useful intermediate step in establishing our lower bounds.

Reference-contexts: For single M/M/1 and M/D/1 queues, it is well known that when ae &lt; 1 the queue is stable, meaning that there is a unique equilibrium distribution and that such quantities as the average delay and queue size are well defined <ref> [6] </ref>. We shall generally assume stability for the networks analyzed in this paper without further concern; indeed, the upper bounds given demonstrate the stability of the networks for ae &lt; 1. <p> For the PS network, under the invariant distribution the number of packets at each queue has a geometric distribution with mean e OE e e .

The average time a packet spends in the queue in this case can be derived from the Pollaczek-Khinchin mean value formula <ref> [6] </ref>. Let d be the arrival rate at an M/D/1 queue, N d be the expected number of packets in the queue in equi librium, and S be the random variable representing the ser vice time for a packet.

Reference-contexts: We can interpret our result as saying that for the array, the Jackson model provides an upper bound on the average lifetime of a packet in the system for the standard (unit-time transmission) model. As described in [1] and noted as far back as <ref> [7] </ref>, the arrival rates at a queue edge can be easily determined combinatorially. <p> The theorem is a simple application of Lagrange multi pliers. Recall that N = P j j =(OE j j ). One forms the Lagrangian N = j " j # and satisfies the equations @N 0 @OE j = 0 for all j. (See, for example, <ref> [7] </ref> or [4].) Note that when all the d e = 1, so improving any queue can be done with equal expense, the optimal allocation corresponds to first allocating each queue just enough service capability to handle its arrival load, and then distributing the remaining money proportionally to the square root <p> original array network D = 4n (n 1), and thus D fl = 4n (n1) e2E e : We use the identity that the sum of the arrival rates at each node equals the average distance traveled by a packet multiplied by the total external arrival rate. (See, for example, <ref> [7] </ref>.) Thus D = 4n (n 1) e2E 2 and hence D fl is positive whenever &lt; n 1 ) = n + 1 If transmission capacity is optimally distributed, then the array will remain stable under arrival rates of &lt; 6=(n + 1), as opposed to 4=n. <p> One can similarly find solutions for the problem when other, non-linear constraints are imposed, or where costs vary from edge to edge. Natural constraints depend on the relationship between cost and transmission speed. Further examples of the method can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. In practice, one might instead wish to choose transmission rates from a finite set of possibilities.

Reference-contexts: One might also think that d could be replaced by n 2 , the expected number of queues a packet travels through. Indeed, the author made this mistake in an earlier version of the paper <ref> [11] </ref>. However, the remaining distance a packet has left to travel depends on its location, and the distribution of packet locations is not, in general, independent of the number of packets.

Before providing the relevant theorem, we briefly explain the intuition. <p> 1 i (ni) 1 This relation between the upper bound and the Jackson open network model will continue to prove useful throughout the paper. 4 An Approximation and Lower Bounds 4.1 Previous lower bound methods Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis developed a lower bound technique for routing on butterfly and hypercube networks <ref> [12] </ref>. Essentially, the bounds are achieved by looking at a subset of the edges that satisfies the condition that a packet only crosses one edge from that subset. For example, one can examine edges crossing a single dimension of the hypercube or the first layer in the butterfly. <p> For the butterfly consisting of d levels, all packets go through d edges. By Theorem 10, in the limit as ae approaches 1 our lower bound is within a factor of 2d of the upper bound. This matches the results of Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis, as one would expect <ref> [12] </ref>. The lower bounds for both of these networks could be improved by better bounds on the expected remaining number of services in equilibrium. <p> A more detailed argument can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. 6 Open Problems Leighton also examines toroidal networks, which appear very similar to array networks [8, 9]. Although the lower bound techniques described in this paper apply to this case, the methods of Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis do not.
