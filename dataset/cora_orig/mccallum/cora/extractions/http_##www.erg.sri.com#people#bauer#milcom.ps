Title: A RELIABLE MULTICAST TRANSPORT PROTOCOL FOR A GLOBAL BROADCAST SERVICE-BASED NETWORK  
Author: Fred Bauer Michael Brown 
Address: Menlo Park, California  
Affiliation: SRI International Information, Telecommunications, and Automation Division  
Abstract: The Global Broadcast Service (GBS), a direct broadcast satellite network, connects military units in remote corners of the world using low-cost receive-only terminals. The marriage of GBS' network reach and commercial, off-the-shelf Internet software could connect these same units into a global internetwork and substantially improve battlefield communications and capabilities. This paper 1 focuses on the efforts made in the DARPA BADD ACTD to lay the groundwork for future Internet applications of particular interest: multicast applications. Since no single, widely accepted reliable multicast protocol yet exists, we introduce and describe the Transport for Reliable Multicast (TRM) and a sample multicast application using TRM, the proxy Web 2 server. The multicast proxy server is used to disseminate Web pages of interest to remote Web servers in the same multicast group.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, less bandwidth is available to applications using TCP over a DBS network than would be available through the satellite <ref> [1, 6, 11] </ref>. Finally, receivers may fall silent either because of a broken communications path or because units wish to maintain radio silence. (We refer to such receivers as radio silent.) The majority of Internet applications use connection-oriented protocol TCP, which depends on return traffic from receivers. <p> Thus, these applications cannot serve radio-silent receivers. An early experimental version of such a hybrid internetwork, described by Arora et al., used both the Internet and DBS links <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper we focus on the challenges we faced to provide a reliable multicast transport protocol and a multicast-aware proxy Web server in the DBS environment provided by the Global Broadcast Service (GBS) for the DARPA BADD ACTD [4, 5].

Reference-contexts: The 1995 Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (JWID '95) used software specifically designed to accommodate direct broadcast satellites to transfer files and blocks of data to units in the field equipped with DBS receivers <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. A hybrid internetwork comprising both bidirectional links (e.g., fiber-optic, Ethernet, and packet radio) and unidirectional links such as DBS satellite links poses a number of challenges to standard Internet applications. The Internet today consists primarily of symmetric, wired communications links.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, a multicast Web proxy server need never know if it has one or more receivers. To create a transport-layer-independent, multicast-aware Web proxy server, we modified the popular Web server developed at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) <ref> [3] </ref>. This modified CERN 4 proxy Web server takes advantage of the interaction between two Web servers chained together in series.

Lifting TCP's limit for high-bandwidth, long-delay pipes such as satellites and large terrestrial links is an area of active research <ref> [6, 11] </ref>. Further, TCP cannot support unidirectional links such as those to radio-silent downlink sites. Thus, an application based on TCP can reach only one fully connected receiver in the field at a time. UDP, by contrast, is an unreliable, unordered IP transport protocol.

VIPRE takes advantage of the underlying ATM network to make a unidirectional satellite link appear as if it were bidirectional, allowing Internet applications to be run unaltered over GBS.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Satellite-based computer communications networks (also referred to as internetworks) have a long and rich history. Often these satellite-based networks consisted of large, costly earth stations providing bidirectional data flow to other earth stations over a satellite and forming high-speed, high-latency network links in a global internetwork <ref> [8] </ref>. The cost and size of these network nodes have limited their deployment.

Reference-contexts: To satisfy these three demands, we introduced TRM into the BADD internetwork. TRM was originally designed for a wide-area internetwork with symmetric, bidirectional communications links, IP multicast address support, and the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [9] </ref>. IP multicasting provides the routing required for data delivery to multiple destinations, while IGMP creates multicast group memberships. TRM provides mechanisms for connection management, error detection and correction, and flow control, while maintaining an n-to-n group communications model for multicast groups.
