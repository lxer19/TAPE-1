Abstract: Developing shape models is an important aspect of computer vision research. Geometric and differential properties of the surface can be computed from shape models. They also aid the tasks of object representation and recognition. In this paper we present an innovative new approach for shape modeling which, while retaining important features of the existing methods, overcomes most of their limitations. Our technique can be applied to model arbitrarily complex shapes, shapes with protrusions, and to situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology can be made. A single instance of our model, when presented with an image having more than one object of interest, has the ability to split freely to represent each object. Our method is based on the level set ideas developed by Osher & Sethian to follow propagating solid/liquid interfaces with curvature-dependent speeds. The interface (front) is a closed, nonintersecting, hypersurface flowing along its gradient field with constant speed or a speed that depends on the curvature. We move the interface by solving a "Hamilton-Jacobi" type equation written for a function in which the interface is a particular level set. A speed function synthesized from the image is used to stop the interface in the vicinity of the object boundaries. The resulting equations of motion are solved by numerical techniques borrowed from the technology of hyperbolic conservation laws. An added advantage of this scheme is that it can easily be extended to any number of space dimensions. The efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated with numerical experiments on synthesized images and noisy medical images. fl Submitted for publication in the IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence.

Reference-contexts: In the problem area of automatic segmentation of noisy images, snakes perform poorly unless they are placed close to the preferred shapes. In a move to make the final result relatively insensitive to the initial conditions, Cohen <ref> [5] </ref> defines an inflation force on the active contour. This new force makes the model behave like an inflating balloon. <p> The term F A , referred to as the advection term, is independent of the moving front's geometry. The front uniformly expands or contracts with speed F A depending on its sign and is analogous to the inflation force defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. The second term F G , is the part which depends on the geometry of the front, such as its local curvature.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if F G 6= 0, the level sets will violate the property that they are a constant distance away from each other. However, they will never collide and cross each other if the speed function F = F A + F G is continuous (see <ref> [8] </ref>). With the above remarks in mind we state the following: 12 Property 1 Any external (image-based) speed function that is used in the equation of motion written for the function should not cause the level sets to collide and cross each other during the evolutionary process.

Kass et al. <ref> [9] </ref> used energy-minimizing "snakes" that are attracted to the image features such as edges points and edge segments, whereas internal spline forces impose a smoothness constraint. The weights of the smoothness and image force terms in the energy functional can be adjusted for different kinds of behavior. <p> This (diffusion) term smooths out the high curvature regions of the front and has the same regularizing effect on the front as the internal deformation energy term in 10 thin-plate-membrane splines <ref> [9] </ref>. We rewrite equation (6) by splitting the influence of F as t + F A j r j +F G j r j= 0: (7) First consider the case when the front moves with a constant speed, i.e. F = F A .

Reference-contexts: Instead, we propose a method that will start with a single instance of the model and will sprout the branches during the evolutionary process. Once the shape has been segmented from the image, its constituent part structure can be inferred <ref> [10] </ref>. Most existing surface modeling techniques require that the topology of the object be known before the reconstruction can commence. However, it is not always possible to specify the topology of an object prior to its reconstruction. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in [13, 18, 19], has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. <ref> [10] </ref>, who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. This leads to a hierarchical description of a shape which is suitable for its recognition.

Our method is inspired by ideas first introduced in Osher & Sethian [13, 19] to follow propagating fronts with curvature-dependent speeds.

Reference-contexts: Our method is inspired by ideas first introduced in Osher & Sethian <ref> [13, 19] </ref> to follow propagating fronts with curvature-dependent speeds. Two such examples are flame propagation and crystal growth, in which the speed of the moving interface normal to itself depends on transport terms modified by the local curvature. <p> Sethian [18] has shown that direct parameterization of the moving front may be unstable since it relies on local properties of the solution. In contrast, a method which preserves the global properties of the motion is sought. Osher and Sethian <ref> [13, 19] </ref> achieve this by embedding the surface in a higher-dimensional function. The equation of motion for this function is reminiscent of an initial valued Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a parabolic right-hand side and is closely related to a 5 viscous hyperbolic conservation law. <p> Following the level set approach above, this hypersurface is then made to flow along its gradient field with some speed F (K), where K is the curvature of the hypersurface. As in <ref> [13] </ref>, we adopt a global approach and view the (N 1) dimensional moving surface as a level set of a time-dependent function of N space dimensions. The equations of motion written for this higher dimensional function are then amenable to stable entropy-satisfying numerical schemes designed to approximate hyperbolic conservation laws. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in <ref> [13, 18, 19] </ref>, has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. [10], who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. <p> We close with a discussion of advantages of our approach and direction of future research in section 5. 2 Front propagation problem In this section we present the level set technique due to Osher and Sethian <ref> [13] </ref>. For details and an expository review, see Sethian [19]. <p> As an alternative, the central idea in the level set approach of Osher and Sethian <ref> [13] </ref> is to represent the front fl (t) as the level set f = 0g of a function . To motivate this approach, we consider the example of an expanding circle. Suppose the initial front fl at t = 0 is a circle in the xy-plane (figure 2 (a)). <p> The gradient r (x; t) is normal to the (N 1) dimensional level set passing through x. Now, we derive the equation of motion for function . Consider the motion of some level set f = Cg. Following the derivation in <ref> [13] </ref>, let x (t) 8 be the trajectory of a particle located on this level set, so (x (t); t) = C: (1) The particle speed @x=@t in the direction n normal to fl (t) is given by the speed function F . <p> 2 R 2 , the curvature is given by K = x 2 x y xy + xx 2 ( 2 y ) 3=2 : (5) This approach can also be easily extended to higher dimensions and appropriate expressions can be obtained for the mean curvature and the Gaussian curvature <ref> [13] </ref>. By substituting F (K) = 1 "K as a typical speed function in equation (4), the equation of motion becomes t + j r j= "K j r j : (6) Equation (6) resembles a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with viscosity, where "viscosity" refers to the second-order parabolic right-hand side. <p> This equation can be solved using the stable, entropy-satisfying finite difference schemes, borrowed from the literature on hyperbolic conservation laws (see <ref> [13] </ref>). 3 Shape reconstruction with front propagation In this section, we describe how the level set formulation for the front propagation problem discussed in the previous section can be used for shape reconstruction. There is a fundamental difference between the problems of front propagation and shape reconstruction. <p> For complete details of the following scheme, we refer the reader to Osher & Sethian <ref> [13, 19] </ref>. The equation (6) poses an initial valued problem. It is rewritten here as t + ( 2 y ) 1=2 = "r r ! with (x; y; t = 0) = distance from (x; y) to fl (0). <p> Thus, approximations to the spatial derivative are sought that do not artificially smooth sharp corners and which pick out the correct entropy solution when singularities develop. The schemes given in <ref> [13, 19] </ref> are motivated by the fact that the entropy condition for propagating fronts is identical to the one for hyperbolic conservation laws, where stable, consistent, entropy-satisfying algorithms have a rich history. First, consider the one-dimensional version of the level set equation, with constant normal velocity F A = 1. <p> In the special case where H (u) may be written as a function of u 2 , i.e., H (u) = f (u 2 ) for some function f , one can use the Hamilton-Jacobi flux function given in <ref> [13] </ref>: g (u i1=2 ; u i+1=2 ) = g (D x i ) x ; 0)) 2 + (min (D + This conservative monotone scheme is upwind method in that it differences in the direction of propagating characteristics. <p> The above discussion can be extended to problems in more than one space dimension (see Osher & Sethian <ref> [13] </ref>). Recall that the original intent was to solve equations (9) and (11). <p> Our approach while retaining the desirable features of existing methods for shape modeling, overcomes most of their deficiencies. We adopt the level set techniques first introduced in Osher & Sethian <ref> [13] </ref> to the problem of shape recovery. With this approach, complex shapes can be reconstructed. Unlike the variational formulations for shape reconstruction which rely on energy minimization, the final result in our method is completely independent of the initial state.

Reference-contexts: During their evolution, these closed contours may change connectivity and split, thereby undergoing a topological transformation. A heuristic criterion for splitting and merging which is based on monitoring deformation energies of points on the elastic curve has been discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>. More recently, molecular dynamics has been used to model surfaces of arbitrary topology [20]. Smoothness and continuity constraints are imposed by subjecting a particle system to interaction potentials which locally prefer planar or spherical arrangement.

Reference-contexts: One possible solution to this problem is to embed the snake model, which is an instance of a 1D thin-plate-membrane-spline, in an adaptive environment wherein the material parameters controlling 3 the relative strengths of elasticity and rigidity are adapted (see <ref> [16] </ref>). The merits of such an approach are suspect since it is not always possible to derive criteria upon which to base the adaptation algorithm. So the problem is one of accurately modeling bifurcations and protrusions in complex structures.

Reference-contexts: The challenge in these problems is to devise numerical schemes for the equations of the propagating front which will accurately approximate these highly unstable physical phenomena. Sethian <ref> [18] </ref> has shown that direct parameterization of the moving front may be unstable since it relies on local properties of the solution. In contrast, a method which preserves the global properties of the motion is sought. <p> In the following sections we outline a possible solution to these problems. We note that this work on interface motion and hyperbolic conservation laws as discussed in <ref> [13, 18, 19] </ref>, has been applied in the area of computer vision for shape characterization by Kimia et al. [10], who unify many diverse aspects of shape by defining a continuum of shapes (reaction/diffusion space), which places shapes within a neighborhood of other similar shapes. <p> These discrete markers are updated in time by approximating the spatial derivatives in the equations of motion, and advancing their positions one time step. However, there are several problems with this approach, as discussed in Sethian <ref> [18] </ref>. First, small errors in the computed particle positions are tremendously amplified by the curvature term, and calculations are prone to instability unless an extremely small time step is employed. <p> The equation (6) poses an initial valued problem. It is rewritten here as t + ( 2 y ) 1=2 = "r r ! with (x; y; t = 0) = distance from (x; y) to fl (0). As shown in Sethian <ref> [18] </ref>, for " &gt; 0, the parabolic right-hand side diffuses sharp gradients and forces to stay smooth at all values of t. For " = 0, the boundary moves with unit speed, and a corner must develop from smooth initial data. <p> Of all such weak solutions, one is interested in the one that is the limit of smooth solutions as " ! 0. This particular weak solution can be selected with the help of a so-called "entropy condition", see <ref> [18] </ref>: If the front is viewed as a burning flame, then once a particle is burnt it stays burnt. Thus, approximations to the spatial derivative are sought that do not artificially smooth sharp corners and which pick out the correct entropy solution when singularities develop.

Generalized spline models with continuity constraints are well suited for fulfilling the goals of shape reconstruction (see [3, 4, 21]). Generalized splines are the key ingredient of the dynamic shape modeling paradigm introduced by Terzopoulos et al., [22].
