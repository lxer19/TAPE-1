Reference-contexts: One can argue that the goal of sensory processing should be to reduce the dimensionality of the input space. All high-level vision problems become more tractable when formulated in a low-dimensional space, e.g., shape-from-shading (Atick et al. 1996) and face recognition <ref> (Atick et al. 1995) </ref>.

Undoubtedly, PCA has some significant limitations. For example, PCA is not capable of extracting local feature-like structures in objects.

Reference-contexts: We will keep the existence of this degree of freedom in mind for future reference, but in the current analysis we will make the simplest choice U rs = ffi rs . This fixing of the unitary symmetry was derived in a previous work on the retina <ref> (Atick et al. 1993) </ref> by applying the criterion of minimal distortion from input to output, where it was shown to generate local receptive fields in the case N = V .

Reference-contexts: By insisting on topography, we arrive at V outputs O (x) described by N &lt;< V linearly independent variables A r . This means that we can no longer satisfy the desirable condition of output decorrelation hO (x)O (y)i = ffi (x; y) <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref>. We can nevertheless impose and satisfy the condition of minimum correlation of the output. <p> This transformation is familiar from previous work on the retina <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref>. <p> then the resulting factor will be effectively a band-pass filter in the eigenmode number r, i.e., it attenuates the power for small r (high ) as well as high r (small ) and amplifies it for intermediate values of r|very much like the contrast sensitivity curves encountered in earlier work <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref>. The exact form of the optimal bandpass filter can be derived only after a specific model of the noise is adopted. 6 Network: Computation in Neural Systems 7 (3), 477-500 transformation U without affecting the degree of their decorrelation. <p> Then P (x; y) ! ffi (x; y) and complete decorrelation of the outputs is achieved, as in the case of the retinal <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref> and the LGN (Dong and Atick 1995b; Dan et al. 1996) analysis. <p> This means that the topographic LFA representation has the same best reconstruction, generalization, and object constancy properties as the global nontopographic PCA one. The O (x) representation (eq. 9) is a general case of the previous work on optimal retinal coding <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref>. In the special case of the retina, the input ensemble is assumed to be translationally and rotationally invariant. <p> autocorrelation function of natural scenes that has been measured by several groups (Burton and Moorhead 1987; Field 1987; Tolhurst et al. 1992; Hancock et al. 1992; Ruderman and Bialek 1994; Ruderman 1994b; Dong and Atick 1995a), and it is the quantity that seems to dictate the coding of the retina <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref> and the LGN (Dong and Atick 1995b; Dan et al. 1996). <p> The lighting is roughly y There is good evidence that the visual system is conserved only with the most general correlation function at the initial stages of the visual processing|the retina <ref> (Atick and Redlich 1992) </ref> and the LGN (Dong and Atick 1995b; Dan et al. 1996). z In this paper we wanted to illustrate the idea of LFA so it was not strictly necessary to concern ourselves with any other correlation function but that of the ensemble we were studying. 18 Network:

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, one would expect that there is a small number of variables that a face should be described with|much lower than the number of pixels needed to represent it, and practical measurements have confirmed that <ref> (Sirovich and Kirby 1987) </ref>. Currently, there are many algorithms of varying complexity for attempting to discover low-dimensional representations of signals by relying on their statistical regularitiesy. So far, however, the most practical and systematic method has been Principal Component Analysis. <p> The power of PCA stems from its ease of computability and its general applicability, and so far it has been used in many real-world problems. For example, it has been used to produce a representation of 2D faces|eigenfaces <ref> (Sirovich and Kirby 1987) </ref>|and y These include algorithms for Principal Component Analysis (Linsker 1988; Oja 1989; Sanger 1989; Foldiak 1990; Plumbey 1991), Gaussian Component Analysis (Goodall 1960; Atick et al. 1993), Independent Component Analysis (Jutten and Herault 1991; Comon 1994; Bell and Sejnowski 1995), Factorial Learning (Barlow et al. 1989; Hentschel <p> information PCA uses is the second-order correlation function R (x; y) (eq. 1), a byproduct of P [(x)], which itself is not used anywhere in this analysis. z In the case T &lt;< V , R (x; y) is highly degenerate (rank deficient), and one can use the snapshot method <ref> (Sirovich 1987) </ref> to carry out the diagonalization of a prohibitively large V fiV matrix through a diagonalization of a T fi T matrix instead. x Throughout the paper we use the integral over the input space x to signify the dot product of two input patterns.

Furthermore, any categorization algorithm needs not be a final one; it suffices to be a hypothesis generator. Then a powerful measure for hypothesis testing is the pixel entropy of the resulting representation.
