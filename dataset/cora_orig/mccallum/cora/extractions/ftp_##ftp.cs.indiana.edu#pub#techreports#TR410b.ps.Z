Reference-contexts: In the process some hardware bugs were detected and repaired. This new configuration is used by the author to test the LL9 and KLLA analog logic circuits and others, including a digital implementation of the LL9/KLLA logic. (The LL9/KLLA logic is described in <ref> [MBD90] </ref> and [Mil91]. A KLLA test is described in [MM93].) This technical report is organized in a bottom-up manner. Section 2 report describes the physical design of the ATB, with an eye toward maintaining it in operating condition.

Reference-contexts: The DACs are double-buffered, and can be controlled either to convert S in immediately or to wait until a separate Xfer.L signal is received. When 2 The notation signal.L refers to a controlling signal which is logically true when its electrical value is 0V. This notation is described in <ref> [PW87] </ref>; IC schematics often write such signals in the form signal. 3 Both 47pF and 100pF feedback capacitors are used with the op amps; the exact value is not critical. 6 a DAC is addressed, the Address Decode Board converts the address into aWrite.L signal which enables the appropriate DAC to
