Abstract: The Lane-Curvature Method (LCM) presented in this paper is a new local obstacle avoidance method for indoor mobile robots. The method combines the Curvature-Velocity Method (CVM) with a new directional method called the Lane Method. The lane method divides the environment into lanes, and then chooses the best lane to follow to optimize travel along a desired heading. A local heading is then calculated for entering and following the best lane, and CVM uses this heading to determine the optimal translational and rotational velocities, considering the heading direction, physical limitations, and environmental constraints. By combining both directional and velocity space methods, LCM yields safe collision-free motion as well as smooth motion taking the dynamics of the robot into account.

Reference-contexts: In our experiments, ffi is set to 0:5. The relationship between the heading command, viewing angle, and blocking angle is shown in the Figure 2. Experiments and Results The LCM algorithm has been implemented and extensively tested on the Xavier mobile robot (Figure 3) <ref> [10] </ref>. Xavier is built on a four-wheel synchro-drive base, produced by RWI, and has independent control over translational and rotational velocities. For obstacle detection, it uses a ring of 24 sonars (data rate 2 Hz) and a 30 degree field of view front-pointing No-madics laser range sensor.
