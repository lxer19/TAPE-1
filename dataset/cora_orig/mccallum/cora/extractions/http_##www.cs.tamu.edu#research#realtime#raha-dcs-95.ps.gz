Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of guaranteeing the end-to-end deadlines of hard real-time connections in an ATM network. In an ATM network, a set of hard real-time connections can be admitted only if the end-to-end delays of cells belonging to individual connections are not more than their deadlines. We systematically decompose an ATM network into constant delay and variable delay servers to facilitate the delay analysis. Effective traffic description is the key part of such a process. We propose a comprehensive traffic description function that provides adequate information about the worst case traffic behavior of connections anywhere in the network. We also study some simple approximations of this function that perform reasonably well in practice. We analyze and compare the performance of ATM networks with FCFS and WRR link scheduling policies under different loading conditions.

Our work differs from the previous work in that we systematically consider the impact of traffic description on the worst case end-to-end cell delays. <p> In this paper we assume that the connections never form a loop. The network may run into an unstable status if several connection routes form a loop. In an unstable status, cells may suffer indefinite delays <ref> [4] </ref>. Clearly, this is not accept able for hard real-time applications, In ATM networks, the messages are packetized into fixed size packets called cells. Let CT be the transmission time of an ATM cell. We assume that time is normalized in terms of CT as one time unit.

Reference-contexts: Since the analysis of constant delay servers is trivial, we need to study only variable delay servers. Furthermore, we will only focus on the output port controller at ATM switches. The analysis of leaky bucket regulator, another type of variable delay servers, can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. 3 Traffic description Network analysis requires a description of each connection's cell arrival pattern at selected points in the network. In traditional networks, stochastic models have been used for this purpose. <p> We will concentrate on the output link controllers because they play a critical role in the end-to-end delay of cells. The leaky bucket analysis has not been included here due to lack of space. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref>. Output link controller in an ATM switch is a major contributor to the end-to-end delay of cells. At the output link controller cells from various connections destined to the same output link are multiplexed. <p> The following theorem gives the result for the WRR server. The derivation for the FCFS server is omitted here due to space constraints. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> The proof of this theorem (and each of the subsequent theorems in this section) is not provided due to lack of space. The reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref> for the proof. THEOREM 5.1 Functions app (I) defined in (11) and (12) are correct. The results of Theorem 5.1 can be intuitively explained as follows. <p> System C uses a two-point ap proximation of (I). System D uses a non-ideal inter val approximation of (I), and System E uses an ideal interval approximation of (I). 2 The weight assignment scheme used for WRR is the optimal weight assignment proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>. In the following subsections, we discuss the results for two kinds of input traffic: periodic traffic and vari able bit rate traffic. 6.1 Periodic traffic source We first consider the case when the traffic generated by all source hosts is periodic.

Reference-contexts: We consider First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) scheduling disciplines. These schedul ing disciplines are popular because they are simple and easily implemented in hardware. We evaluate the system's capability to support hard real-time connections in terms of a metric called admission probability <ref> [15] </ref>. Admission probability is the probability of meeting the end-to-end deadlines of a set of randomly generated connections. In general, we observe that the admission probability increases when one uses a traffic descriptor that provides a more detailed information regarding a connection's traffic. <p> A hard real-time system usually operates in a modal fashion; i.e., at any given instant the system operates in one of the several known modes <ref> [15] </ref>. System oper ation in a specific mode is characterized by execution of a particular set of applications. Thus, each operational mode of the system has an associated set of connections that must be established between applications that need to communicate.
