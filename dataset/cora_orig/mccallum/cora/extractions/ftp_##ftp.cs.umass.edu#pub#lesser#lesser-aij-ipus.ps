Abstract: The Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals (IPUS) architecture is presented as a framework that exploits formal signal processing models to structure the bidirectional interaction between front-end signal processing and signal understanding processes. This architecture is appropriate for complex environments, which are characterized by variable signal to noise ratios, unpredictable source behaviors, and the simultaneous occurrence of objects whose signal signatures can distort each other. A key aspect of this architecture is that front-end signal processing is dynamically modifiable in response to scenario changes and to the need to re-analyze ambiguous or distorted data. The architecture tightly integrates the search for the appropriate front-end signal processing configuration with the search for plausible interpretations. In our opinion, this dual search, informed by formal signal processing theory, is a necessary component of perceptual systems that must interact with complex environments. To explain this architecture in detail, we discuss examples of its use in an implemented system for acoustic signal interpretation.

Reference-contexts: The construction of these models will require the identification of features that avoid distortions caused by SPAs and/or model interactions as much as possible. Research is being done on incorporating the IPUS reprocessing loop into a framework for learning acoustic source models <ref> [3] </ref>. On initial consideration, it might seem that the time required by multiple reprocessings under IPUS would be unacceptably high in noisy environments.

Reference-contexts: Usually microstreams form "ridges" on top of noisebed "plateaux," but not every noisebed has an associated microstream. Groups of mi-crostreams and noisebeds synchronized according to time and/or other psychoa-coustic criteria such as harmonic frequency sets support stream hypotheses in the seventh level. Bregman <ref> [7] </ref> provides a highly detailed account of various psychoa-coustic streaming processes. At the eighth level, sequences of stream hypotheses are interpreted as sound-source hypotheses.

De Mori et al. <ref> [15] </ref> developed a formal interaction framework in a system to recognize spoken letters of the English alphabet. This framework is representative of architectures with strong reliance on differential diagnosis techniques. These architectures are often employed in domains where there is little or no dependence between consecutive signal events.

Reference-contexts: This strategy is appropriate provided it can be guaranteed that the signal understanding system will not encounter signals which violate the underlying assumptions made in the design of those SPAs. This premise, however, does not appear appropriate for perceptual systems operating in complex environments <ref> [16] </ref>. Since in such domains the SPA assumptions will often be violated, it seems unreasonable to devote computational resources to the extraction of detailed and precise information that is likely to be misleading.

As an example of variable processing goals, consider a system with the primary goal of responding to either the sounds of an infant or a ringing telephone while ignoring other sounds.

Reference-contexts: The architecture supports the use of an application domain's formal signal processing theory in selecting approximate or specialized SPAs for context-dependent application to specific portions of a signal <ref> [33] </ref>. For this reason the research also extends work that emphasizes the fourth dimension (control of SPA application). Several recent systems have been developed that provide for structured interaction between interpretation activity and numeric-level signal processing. <p> In the course of our own research on the acoustic interpretation testbed, we have developed a novel algorithm <ref> [33] </ref> for computing an approximation to the STFT.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2a shows the frequency tracks of four sound sources as they would appear if they were processed with Short-Time Fourier Transform <ref> [36] </ref> (STFT) SPAs appropriate for each portion of the scenario. Figure 2b shows how the tracks appear when the entire scenario is processed by one STFT SPA appropriate only for the steady-state portion of the last sound in the scenario. <p> We refer to the correlate set produced by an SPA as that SPA's computed correlate set. An SPA's parameter values induce capabilities or limitations with respect to the scenario being monitored. Consider the generic Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm <ref> [36] </ref> in the acoustic domain. An STFT instance has particular values for its parameters, such as analysis window length, frequency-sampling rate, and decimation interval (separation between consecutive analysis window positions).

Reference-contexts: This diagnosis process relies on an environment's context rules and the domain's SPA processing models to define distortion processes that take place when an SPA's assumptions about its input signals are violated <ref> [37] </ref>. Note that there is a difference between discrepancies and signal distortion processes. Distortion processes are used to explain discrepancies. It is also possible for several distortion processes to explain the same kinds of discrepancies. <p> This research represents the formalization and extension of concepts explored in earlier work on a diagnosis system that exploited formal signal processing theory to debug signal processing systems <ref> [37] </ref> and in work on meta-level control [24, 25] that used a process of fault-detection, diagnosis, and replanning to decide the most appropriate parameters for controlling a problem-solving system. <p> When applied to an abstract description of anticipated or computed correlates, an operator returns the description modified to contain the operator's distortion. The KS uses these operators in a means-ends analysis framework incorporating multiple abstraction levels and a verification phase <ref> [37] </ref> to "explain" fault, violation, and conflict discrepancies. The KS takes two inputs: an initial state representing anticipated correlates and a goal state representing the computed correlates. The formal task of the KS is to generate a distortion operator sequence mapping the initial state description onto the goal state description. <p> If no patch is possible, and no alternative explanations can be generated, the involved signal hypotheses are annotated with an SOU with a very negative rating. Figure 7 outlines the plan-and-verify strategy of the diagnostic process. An issue not addressed in earlier work <ref> [37] </ref> that arose in the development of IPUS is the problem of inapplicable explanations. Sometimes the first explanation offered by the KS will not enable the reprocessing mechanism to eliminate a discrepancy.

This view is supported by the similarities shared between the testbed's acoustic domain theory and that of many other signal domains such as sonar <ref> [39] </ref>, weather radar [9], music [26], and biomedical signals [14]. In conclusion, we have shown how knowledge from formal signal processing theory regarding the effectiveness of specific SPA configurations for particular environments can be used to develop a highly adaptive signal understanding architecture.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the KS mimics expert diagnostic reasoning in that it offers simplest (shortest) explanations first <ref> [41] </ref>. Once a sequence is found, the KS enters its verify phase, "drops" to the lowest abstraction level, and checks that each operator's pre- and post-conditions are met when all available state information is considered.

Control theory uses stochastic-process concepts to characterize signals, and these characterizations are limited to probabilistic moments, usually no higher than second-order. Discrepancies between these stochastic characterizations and an SPA's output data are used to adapt future signal processing.

Reference-contexts: The cut mechanism also does not permit the use of formal diagnostic reasoning to further constrain parameter-value search based on the cause of an SPA predicate failure. Research in active vision and robotics has recognized the importance of tracking-oriented front-end SPA reconfiguration <ref> [43] </ref>, and tends to use a control-theoretic approach for making reconfiguration decisions. It is indeed sometimes possible to reduce the reconfiguration of small sets of front-end SPAs to problems in linear control theory.
