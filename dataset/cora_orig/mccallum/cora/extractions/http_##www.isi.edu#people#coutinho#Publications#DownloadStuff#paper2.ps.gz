Abstract: In this paper we use combinatorial and computational geometry techniques to make the sim-plicial approximation theorem a computational, rather than conceptual, tool to check robust stability for systems that are not in Kharitonov's class. A simplicial program was developed with a O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the car-dinality of the vertex set of points mapped to the complex plane, using the Nyquist map f.

The simplex is said to be completely labelled whenever it contains all labels at its vertices.

Reference-contexts: By constraining the way nodes are colored on any path from the root to a leaf, RB tree ensures that no such path is more than twice as long as any other <ref> [Cor] </ref>. A RB tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2 log (n + 1). Therefore, the insert and delete operations can be supported in O (log n) time complexity.
