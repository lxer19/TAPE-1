Abstract: Krylov subspace techniques have been shown to yield robust methods for the numerical computation of large sparse matrix exponentials and especially the transient solutions of Markov Chains. The attractiveness of these methods results from the fact that they allow us to compute the action of a matrix exponential operator on an operand vector without having to compute, explicitly, the matrix exponential in isolation. In this paper we compare a Krylov-based method with some of the current approaches used for computing transient solutions of Markov chains. After a brief synthesis of the features of the methods used, numerical comparisons are performed on a POWER CHALLENGEarray supercomputer on three different models.

Reference-contexts: The Markovian context brings other considerations. We need to compute w (t) = exp (tA)v subject to the constraint that the resulting vector is a probability vector and thus with components in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and with sum equal to 1. Since the analytic solution of the Chapman-Kolmogorov system of differential equations is w (t), its computation can be addressed totally in the perspective of ODEs. But ODEs solvers do not bring any guarantees either. <p> The shortcoming of Uniformization is that p is likely to be large (and thus (7) involves many matrix-vector mutiplications) for large values of t. A variant of Unformization, referred to as Power Uniformization was proposed by Ab-dallah and Marie <ref> [1] </ref>. It combines the standard Uniformization with scaling and squaring as follows. We may write e tA = e 2 s (9) where s is chosen such that k tA 2 s k &lt; 1. <p> The technique then uses a truncated Taylor series (modified as in the Uniformization method) to approximate e tA 2 s and repeated squaring to recover e tA . This method is numerically stable <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. However, in contrast to the standard Uniformization which uses only matrix-vector operations, the scaling-squaring phase of Power Uniformization uses matrix-matrix operations and thus is suitable for small-sized problems only. 4 ODE Solvers The remainder of our overview, presented in x 4.1 - x 4.3, deals with ODE solution-techniques.

Reference-contexts: Processes which terminate their service at the SM or FD queue return to the CPU queue. Symbolically, completion of a command is represented by a departure of the process from the CPU to the terminals. This model has been often used in previous studies, (see <ref> [16] </ref>). The matrices that are obtained are nearly-completely-decomposable, a factor that makes computation of stationary distribution by certain methods rather difficult. Our interest is in seeing how it affects methods for obtaining transient solutions.
