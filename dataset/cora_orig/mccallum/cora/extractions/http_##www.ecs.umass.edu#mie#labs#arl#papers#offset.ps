Abstract: It is widely accepted that automatic process planning is the key solution to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. In order to realize this, it is important that the CAD system should not only allow the designer to work in terms of features which relate to manufacturing operations but also be able to extract features and recognize them. Extraction of features internal to the contour of the sheet metal involves identifying groups that are connected to members within itself but not connected to any other group. However the same rationale cannot be adopted for features on the contour due to the their lack of connectivity. This paper presents a new approach towards extracting contour features by generating the offset of the contour. It is important that once the features have been extracted and recognized appropriate tools for creating the feature be identified. This paper proposes a tool mapping algorithm based on the medial axis transformation(MAT). Since stamping is assumed to be the

Reference-contexts: The medial 18 axis transformation helps to automatically extract the above characteristics of the shape and also decompose a complex shape into a set of topologically simple sub-domains, given the geometric description of the physical domain. The concept of MAT is a technique first proposed by Blum <ref> [Blum 73] </ref> as method to describe a figure in two dimensions. Any point on a plane containing the shape can be associated with the closest point on the contour of the shape. Some points on the plane containing the shape do not have a unique point on the contour.

Reference-contexts: Kyprianou [Kyprianou 80] developed a shape feature rec-ognizer from a boundary representation for the purpose of part classification and 5 coding. Recognizable features were either protrusion or depressions. Depressions were further classified as slots pockets, or through holes, and protrusions as bosses or bridges. Choi <ref> [Choi 84] </ref> et al. used explicit feature definitions in the feature recog-nizer for recognizing a generic hole, slot, and pocket in a solid model. Staley et al. [Staley 83] also used syntactic pattern recognition to classify 2-D cross sections. Hen-derson [Henderson 84] described features as rules.

By offsetting the control vertex of the original curve the control vertex of the offset curve was obtained.

The work of Hummel and Brown <ref> [Hummel 89] </ref> is profound in the recognition of context dependence of features and the advocacy that it is not feasible for a designer to create a product using features and at the same time select the set of features which most adequately characterizes the manufacturability of that product.

Reference-contexts: This system is driven by a variational geometry engine which allows the user to work in terms of features and attach features to parts. It can also accept an IGES file as the input. The flattening module <ref> [Kamran 92] </ref> uses the concept of a neutral axis to generate the blank for the sheet metal part. The blank of the sheet metal is the input for the feature extraction process using offsets. <p> In this process, the geometric data is treated as a graph. A vertex represents a node; an edge represents a linkage. Based on the fact that two edges can only intersect at a vertex, a backtracking process is initiated to accomplish the task of grouping the connected edges <ref> [Kamran 92] </ref>. These edges are grouped together in such a way that adjacent vertices follow one another. In Figure 7, the part is divided into 7 groups. At this point, each group implies the existence of a feature or some features within it.

Reference-contexts: Offsetting algorithms which are based on spline representation have also been developed. These algorithms use an iterative process that is based on a subdivision technique for refining and improving the accuracy of the offset curve. Klass <ref> [Klass 83] </ref> constructs a cubic spline as an approximate offset to another cubic-spline segment, where both curves can be defined in terms of their end points and the tangents at these points.

Reference-contexts: Such a sub region is bounded by a portion of the medial axis and two line segments which are perpendicular to the edges at the reflex vertex and intersect the medial axis. 20 7.2 Algorithm for MAT The algorithm employed for medial axis generation is the one proposed by Lee <ref> [Lee 82] </ref> with minor modifications. A brief description of the algorithm is given below. Given a polygon G with m edges and n reflex vertices it is considered to have k elements where k = m + n. <p> The output of the above recursive process is the Voronoi diagram of each group. The final merge involves merging the two Voronoi diagrams of the group. The merge process is based on the algorithm suggested by Lee <ref> [Lee 82] </ref> 21 The last process of MAT generation is the building of topology and removal of dangling edges. This recursive process eliminates edges whose vertex carries information about one edge. Every branch point is equidistant from three or more edges on the contour of the polygon.

Reference-contexts: The edges associated with these portions of the contour crystalize as a feature. This provides a quantitative definition of a feature which is consistent with the definition by Nnaji <ref> [Nnaji 91] </ref>. 15 6.1 Algorithm Contour feature extraction is performed at the intersection checking stage during offset generation. This process is facilitated by ensuring during preliminary offset generation that each offset edge is mapped to an edge on the contour of the sheet metal.

Reference-contexts: Every point in this region is closer to this element than to any other element in the boundary.
