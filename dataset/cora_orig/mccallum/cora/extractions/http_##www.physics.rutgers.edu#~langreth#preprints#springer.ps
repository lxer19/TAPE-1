Abstract: A general functional form for the exchange-correlation energy of the density-functional theory, valid for widely separated fragments of matter, has recently been proposed [1]. For many kinds of dimers it gives good van der Waals coefficients. Here we also show results for atoms outside surfaces, where it gives a z 3 behavior and reasonable van der Waals coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Because of its non-local nature, the van der Waals interaction is not correctly described by the local or semi-local approximations that are commonly applied in density functional theory (DFT) calculations <ref> [2] </ref>. To restore the vdW interaction in DFT methods, we have used an approach which ties together several previous ideas where local or semi-local approximations are applied in various ways [3, 4, 5, 6].

Reference-contexts: Our expression for the van der Waals coefficient is, C 3 = 4 0 *(iu) 1 ; (5) where *(iu) is the bulk dielectric function. This expression differs from the exact <ref> [14] </ref> by a factor of 2*(iu)=(*(iu) + 1), since our functional is too crude to recognize the fact that outside a surface the true electric field is equal to the applied field multiplied by that factor.

Reference-contexts: In the approximation described here we treat the response to the applied field as local. Presently we are improving the theory by treating the response to the true field as local, an approach which promises to give more accurate results <ref> [15] </ref>.
