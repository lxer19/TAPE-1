Reference-contexts: Signed-digit adders (SDA) use a signed-digit number representation which allows addition to be performed in constant time by restricting carry propagation to at most one digit position [2]. Atkins gives a good overview of this special number system in <ref> [1] </ref>. Each signed-digit is encoded using a two's complement encoding, where each digit occupies d = dlog be + 1 bits, and b is the base. To represent an n-bit number, k = dn=(d 1)e signed-digits are 2 required. Figure 1 (a) shows the block structure of an SDA.

Reference-contexts: This reduces the time spent in the linear region and hence the short circuit power. The optimal size for different loads was determined by performing experiments similar to those described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In addition, reordering of the transistors is done such that series transistors are arranged in the order of their input arrival times so that the latest-arriving input is assigned to the transistor closest to the output node.

Since a level `playing field' is essential for a fair comparison, we wanted to use an automatic layout generation tool.

Reference-contexts: Since the inputs are independent, power can be approximated to be normally distributed <ref> [5] </ref>. Hence, the mean power dissipation of the circuit is given by (x t c s p ), where x is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, N is the number of samples and t c is obtained from the t-distribution for c% confidence interval.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes some approaches to designing high speed, low power adders for digital signal processing (DSP) circuits and systems. The analysis of a set of real-time DSP benchmarks by Chen et. al. <ref> [7] </ref> shows that addition is indeed the most frequently used DSP operation. We present extensive simulation results of the power and delay characteristics of a wide assortment of parallel, synchronous adders for bit-widths ranging from 8 to 64 bits.

Reference-contexts: The novelty of the ELM adder is that it directly computes the sum bits in parallel, thereby reducing the number of interconnects. The carry skip adder (CSK) <ref> [9] </ref> computes only the propagate function and carries start rippling simultaneously through groups. If any group generates a carry, it feeds not only the next group, but skips to the succeeding group as well. It is an O ( p n) time and O (n) area adder.

Reference-contexts: Area and transistor count of the adders. 4 Experiments The experimental results described in this section were obtained using the extraction style parameters from MOSIS for 1:2 scalable CMOS technology. A detailed transistor level simulation was done using Hspice (version 93a.02 release) <ref> [10] </ref> to obtain the power and delay measures. Simulations were carried out at 27 ffi C and a supply voltage of 5V was used for all adders. The actual values for speed and power are inevitably dependent upon the technology and style of implementation. <p> The delay of each adder was measured directly from the output waveforms by presenting the adder with the worst case inputs (i.e., inputs which cause the maximum carry ripple.) To measure the power dissipation, each adder was presented with independent, pseudo-random inputs and the power consumed was monitored using Hspice <ref> [10] </ref>. Since the inputs are independent, power can be approximated to be normally distributed [5].

Reference-contexts: We extend our earlier work on signed-digit adders [12] by incorporating carry lookahead for better performance. These adders are of special interest in DSP because 1 of their speed and suitability for pipelining. Our earlier results <ref> [12, 11] </ref> were based on circuits which were sized from a speed perspective. In this paper, we use a different approach whereby power is minimized. In section 2, we give a brief description of the different adders, following which the circuit generation methodology is described in section 3.

Reference-contexts: Our study also showed that using variable sized groups of carry skip not only improves speed, but reduces power consumption as well, the advantage being more for larger adders. The signed-digit adders are of special interest in signal processing hardware because of their speed and suitability for digit-level pipelining <ref> [13] </ref>. But unfortunately their speed advantage does not come for free. They are logically more complicated than the other adders as evinced by the number of transistors in table 1 and hence consume more power.

Reference-contexts: In the worst case, the carry can propagate from the least significant bit position to the most significant bit position. The MCC is a VLSI adder that makes use of the well known carry generate, propagate and kill functions <ref> [14] </ref> to quickly propagate the carry, once it is generated, along a chain of pass transistors. Buffers are inserted after blocks of four bits each to regenerate the signal. Carry lookahead adders (CLA) have become popular due to their speed and modularity. <p> Carry lookahead adders (CLA) have become popular due to their speed and modularity.
