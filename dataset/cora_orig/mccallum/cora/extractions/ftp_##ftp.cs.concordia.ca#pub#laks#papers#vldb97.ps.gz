Abstract: We present a multi-dimensional database model, which we believe can serve as a conceptual model for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)-based applications. Apart from providing the functionalities necessary for OLAP-based applications, the main feature of the model we propose is a clear separation between structural aspects and the contents. This separation of concerns allows us to define data manipulation languages in a reasonably simple, transparent way. In particular, we show that the data cube operator can be expressed easily. Concretely, we define an algebra and a calculus and show them to be equivalent. We conclude by comparing our approach to related work.

Reference-contexts: In order to allow efficient implementation, we will again require that the summarization functions be first-order definable, in the extended sense of Gradel and Gurevich <ref> [GG95] </ref>, i.e., in a vocabulary including the standard arithmetic operations +, , fi, and =, and repeated additions P and multiplications Q over a set of items (which includes counting). Our next examples illustrate first-order definable summarization functions.

Reference-contexts: Page 1 sets are fPart; Cityg and fYear; Month g, respectively. The measure attributes are Cost and Sale. To illustrate the above, we express in our algebra the popular data cube operator recently proposed by Gray et al. <ref> [GBLP95] </ref>, as well as its useful and practically more attractive variants. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present an informal introduction to our data model for MDD. <p> We conclude this section with a pair of examples illustrating the power of the algebra. Thereto, we show that popular OLAP operators such as data cube and monotone roll-up <ref> [GBLP95] </ref> can be neatly expressed in our algebra. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such operators are being formally shown to be expressible in a rigorous algebra. <p> Red Brick and Oracle are some examples.

Reference-contexts: An elegant idea in Li and Wang's model are the so-called grouping relations, which are used as classification in our model, to prepare cubes for various aggregations.

Although it has some theoretical relevance for OLAP, it does not address important features classification and summarization necessary for practical applications.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we conclude with a comparison with other recent related work, and we point out directions for future research. For brevity, we suppress all proofs and additional examples and details, all of which can be found in the full paper <ref> [GL97] </ref>. 2 A Multi-Dimensional Data Model From a conceptual standpoint, we contend that OLAP calls for the following four kinds of functionalities: 1. Querying : Ability to pose powerful ad-hoc queries through a simple and declarative interface. 2. <p> For a formal definition of syntax and semantics, we have to refer to the full version of this paper <ref> [GL97] </ref>. Here, we limit ourselves to bringing out its flavor by means of some examples. Example 4.1 Consider the table of Figure 1. <p> We prove the following result in the full paper <ref> [GL97] </ref>. Theorem 4.1 The algebra and calculus are equivalent in expressive power.

Reference-contexts: To avoid the explicit handling of multisets, following Klug <ref> [Klu82] </ref>, we model summarization functions as mapping sets of tuples of values to individual values. As numerical type, we consider the rational numbers, thus making it possible to apply the usual arithmetic operations +, , fi, and =.
