Abstract: The corneal maps displayed on commercially available corneal topography instruments are really one-dimensional, defining quantities only along a meridian, and ignoring shape information along any other direction. Both axial and instantaneous power have the drawbacks that there is a singularity at the center data point on the videokeratograph axis, and the computed powers and appearance of the corneal map change depending on the videokeratograph axis or on the location of asymmetries. We propose a new representation for corneal topography maps, Gaussian power with cylinder vector field, that has no singularity, and faithfully produces power values and corneal map patterns that are independent of videokeratograph axis or location of asymmetries.

Reference-contexts: Three particular directions are of interest. One is the plane that includes the point (shown as a red dot) where the videokeratograph axis intersects the cornea. We will call this plane the osculating plane, borrowing a term from differential geometry <ref> [6] </ref>. The osculating plane is slightly tilted from the meridional plane of Figure 1 if the corneal normal does not lie in the meridional plane. <p> That is the strategy followed in [10][11]. In the present paper, howev er, we will follow the clinical convention of using "power". -4- <ref> [6] </ref>. Since there is a strong mathematical correlation between the arithmetic and geometric means, the mean sphere is very similar to Gaussian power; thus, we will consider only Gaussian power and not mean sphere. <p> Gaussian power is easy to calculate for the axially symmetric case since the principal curvatures are aligned with the sagittal and tangential directions. A proof of this is given in <ref> [6] </ref>. The powers along the sagittal and tangential directions are the axial and instantaneous powers, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Instantaneous power is expressed in diopters when the radius is given in meters. From differential geometry <ref> [7] </ref>, it is known that at each point on a smooth surface, there exists a unique direction along which the curvature of the surface is a maximum and another along which it is a minimum (assuming that they are not equal).

Reference-contexts: We will call this plane the osculating plane, borrowing a term from differential geometry [6]. The osculating plane is slightly tilted from the meridional plane of Figure 1 if the corneal normal does not lie in the meridional plane. The angle between these two planes is calculated in <ref> [10] </ref> We call the instantaneous power in the osculating plane the "normal instantaneous power" and the instantaneous power in the meridional plane the "meridional instantaneous power". The other two directions of interest are the the principal directions, as mentioned above. <p> It is crescent-shaped, whereas the Gaussian power with cylinder vector field map is indeed rotationally symmetric. At the border between the sphere and the hyperboloid surface of revolution (that depicts the "cone"), Using the nomenclature in <ref> [10] </ref>, we are displaying "meridional" axial power and "normal" instantaneous power. -7- the slope is continuous and thus the axial power has a smooth transition as shown in the upper right image. <p> We defined instantaneous power in the osculating plane so this connection between axial and instantaneous powers is only approximate, but the error is very small <ref> [10] </ref>. Instead of axial power and instantaneous power, we propose an alternative display using Gaussian power with cylinder vector field representation. Such an approach has considerable advantages.
