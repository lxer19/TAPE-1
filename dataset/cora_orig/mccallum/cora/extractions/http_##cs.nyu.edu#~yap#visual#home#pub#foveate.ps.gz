Title: A Wavelet Approach to Foveating Images  
Author: Ee-Chien Chang and Chee K. Yap 
Address: New York University New York, NY 10012 U.S.A.  
Affiliation: Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences  
Abstract: Motivated by applications of foveated images in visualization, we introduce the foveation transform of an image. We study the basic properties of these transforms using the multiresolution framework of Mallat. We also consider practical methods of realizing such transforms. In particular, we introduce a new method for foveating images based on wavelets. Preliminary experimental results are shown.

Reference-contexts: For visualization, we must compensate for the loss of peripheral fl yap@cs.nyu.edu, supported by an National Science Foundation Grant #CCR-9402464. resolution in foveated images by rapidly presenting images that are foveated at points of user interest. We could use eye-tracking technology <ref> [7] </ref> to follow the eye and to present the corresponding foveated images. In principal, if the foveation uses the correct parameters and eye-tracking is good, a user should not be able to detect any difference from viewing a uniform image. A system with such properties has been reported by [8].

But in our visualization applications, we can dispense with eye-tracking | the visualizer may be counted upon to cooperate with the image server. For instance, the visualizer can indicate moving areas of interest in an image via a standard mouse input.
