Title: WAVELETS FOR WAVEFORM CODING OF DIGITAL SYMBOLS  
Author: Prashant P. Gandhi, Member, IEEE, Sathyanarayan S. Rao, Senior Member, IEEE and Ravikanth S. Pappu 
Abstract: A wavelet-based coder-decoder (codec) structure is defined for baseband waveform coding. Numerical results for bandwidth efficiency are given, and a comparison between several different wavelets is presented. Moreover, it is shown that wavelets obey the Nyquist pulse shaping condition and provide a unified framework for analog pulse shaping concepts of communications.

Reference-contexts: As the order M increases, the D M wavelet becomes increasingly smoother and longer. The Lemarie-Battle wavelet, on the other hand, is defined using cubic spline functions and is neither time-limited nor band-limited (see <ref> [1] </ref>). However, it decays polynomially in time and exponentially in frequency. 3 Waveform Coding Using Scaling Functions and Wavelets In this section, we first discuss the traditional (rectangular-pulse) polar signaling technique used for binary phase shift keying (BPSK).

Reference-contexts: Orthogonality relations h j;k (t); j;n (t)i = ffi kn imply that scaling functions, for a given dilation, are orthogonal across translation whereas wavelets and scaling functions are orthogonal at certain dilations and arbitrary translations. Additionals details and properties of wavelets may be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 There exist many families of wavelets and scaling functions. <p> We consider two well-known wavelet families in this correspondence; they are commonly referred to as Daubechies family of wavelets and Lemarie-Battle wavelets. The Haar wavelet is an extreme example of Daubechies family of wavelets <ref> [2] </ref>. A Daubechies mother wavelet D M of order M , M 2 and even, has finite temporal support in [0; M 1] and its spectrum decays polynomially. The wavelet D 2 is the Haar function and is the only discontinuous wavelet of this family.

Reference-contexts: Decoding is possible, as shown in Figure 5, due to the self- and cross-orthogonality properties of (t= p p T b ) functions. The bit error rate again remains equal to the BPSK scheme as we are dealing with two independent polar signals <ref> [3] </ref>. Further, the data rate is doubled and so is the overall bandwidth. To compare different wavelet-based coding techniques, we employ the bandwidth efficiency (BE) measure defined by BE = Total Bit Rate Bandwidth (bits/sec/Hz) (7) where we assume 99% power bandwidth 1 . <p> As seen from the table, BE improves with higher orders of Daubechies waveforms; Lemarie-Battle waveforms give the best performance. 1 The 99% power bandwidth W (in Hz) of x p (t) is numerically obtained from 0:99 R 1 R 2W <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Wavelets and Zero ISI Waveforms By expressing the shift orthogonal property of scaling functions (t=T b ) in the frequency domain, we get k=1 2k )j 2 = T b (8) where (!) is the continuous-time Fourier transform of (t). <p> We see that (8) is the Nyquist pulse shaping condition for zero intersymbol interference (ISI), with receive waveform matched to the bandlimited transmit waveform (t=T b ) (see <ref> [3] </ref>). This connection between wavelet theory and analog pulse shaping concepts in communications is remarkable [4],[10]. It suggests that bandlimited raised-cosine pulses are related to scaling functions of some suitable family of wavelets.

Reference-contexts: It is shown that Nyquist pulse shaping criterion is satisfied by wavelets and scaling functions. In fact, it turns out that the bandlimited raised-cosine waveforms are scaling functions of a special class of Meyer wavelets <ref> [4] </ref>. We should point out that the present application of wavelets employs analog continuous-time wavelets and scaling functions. <p> This connection between wavelet theory and analog pulse shaping concepts in communications is remarkable <ref> [4] </ref>,[10]. It suggests that bandlimited raised-cosine pulses are related to scaling functions of some suitable family of wavelets. In fact, in [4] it is shown that the square-root raised cosine pulse is a special case of the bandlimited Meyer family of wavelets. We also note that biorthogonal 2 wavelets (as opposed to orthogonal wavelets considered in this paper) have recently been applied to partial response channels [11].

Reference-contexts: We should point out that the present application of wavelets employs analog continuous-time wavelets and scaling functions. This is different from the conventional use of wavelet concepts for discrete-time applications, such as data compression, where wavelet-based approach simply becomes subband coding (see <ref> [5] </ref>). 2 Preliminaries Briefly, let (t) be a (mother) wavelet.

Reference-contexts: Finally, bandwidth efficiency is computed for signaling schemes under consideration, and comparisons are made. We note that the use of strictly bandpass wavelets for baseband coding has been proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> under the fractal modulation framework, where results are presented using the ideal bandlimited 3 "sinc" waveform. Also, bit-by-bit coding using discrete shift-orthogonal wavelet sequences has been recently considered in [7] while application of wavelets for secure communications has been studied in [8],[9].

Reference-contexts: In fact, in [4] it is shown that the square-root raised cosine pulse is a special case of the bandlimited Meyer family of wavelets. We also note that biorthogonal 2 wavelets (as opposed to orthogonal wavelets considered in this paper) have recently been applied to partial response channels <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus continuous-time wavelet theory appears to provide a unified framework for analog pulse shaping. All orthogonal scaling functions and wavelets known to date are candiates for pulse shaping, each giving certain temporal and spectral trade-offs.
