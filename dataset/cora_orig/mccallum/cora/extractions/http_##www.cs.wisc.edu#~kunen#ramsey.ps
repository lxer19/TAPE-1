Abstract: We use the Boyer-Moore Prover, Nqthm, to verify the Paris-Harrington version of Ramsey's Theorem. The proof we verify is a modification of the one given by Ketonen and Solovay. The Theorem is not provable in Peano Arithmetic, and one key step in the proof requires * 0 induction. x0. Introduction. The most well-known formalizations of finite mathematics are PA (Peano Arithmetic) and PRA (Primitive Recursive Arithmetic). In both, the "intended" domain of discourse is the set of natural numbers. PA is formalized in standard first-order logic, and contains the induction schema, which can apply to arbitrary first-order formulas. The logic of PRA allows only quantifier-free formulas, which are thought of as being universally quantified, and PRA has the induction scheme for quantifier-free formulas, expressed as a proof rule. Also, for each primitive recursive function f, PRA contains a function symbol for f and has the recursive definition of f as an axiom. Clearly, PRA is much weaker than PA. In particular, PA can prove the consistency of PRA by simply proving the statement "all sentences provable from PRA are true". The Boyer-Moore theorem prover, Nqthm [2], is a Lisp-based system for computational logic. It allows the user to define functions recursively and to prove theorems about these functions. It is, to first approximation, an implementation of PRA, but it extends PRA in two important ways. The first way is that it allows the use of symbolic expressions (Lisp S-expressions) as basic objects, as well as numbers. In theory, this extension is inessential, since these expressions can be encoded by Godel numbering, but in practice, such a Godel numbering would be extremely awkward to deal with. By dealing with S-expressions directly, Nqthm has become a practical verification tool, and has frequently been used to verify statements in finite combinatorics, as well as theorems about circuit design and algorithm correctness. The second way is essential; Nqthm allows definition of functions by recursion on the ordinal * 0 , and proofs by induction on * 0 . Until now, the full strength of this extension has not been utilized. In this paper, we show how to utilize it. In their book [2], Boyer and Moore point out that ordinals can be used to formalize double recursions. In many applications, this is only a matter of convenience, since the function defined is really primitive recursive, and could, with slightly more work, be defined

Reference-contexts: For example, f3; 5; 7g is large but f4; 5; 7g isn't. Now, it is easy to see that Ramsey's Theorem can be proved within PRA, and the n = 2 case has been verified on Nqthm by Matt Kaufmann (see <ref> [1] </ref>). However, the Paris-Harrington extension cannot be proved even in full PA [5]. It can be proved in PRA plus * 0 induction, as was demonstrated explicitly by Ketonen and Solovay [4], and hence, potentially, can be proved in Nqthm.

Reference-contexts: Actually, [4] proves this just for ff = !, which was sufficient to derive the Paris-Harrington Ramsey Theorem. 2 Now, the Ordinal Ramsey Theorem is done within PRA. Following Gentzen [3], and Boyer-Moore <ref> [2] </ref>, each ordinal below * 0 has a notation, which is a finite symbolic expression, and everything we need about ordinals is proved using ordinary induction on these notations. We only step beyond PRA in the proof that ff large sets exist. <p> Perhaps the author, either by design or through stupidity, entered a definition which does not correctly capture the notion of "homogeneous", perhaps making the whole theorem trivial. As pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref>, since this issue connects the formal and informal notions, it can never be settled formally, but we shall make a few remarks in an effort to convince the reader that our definitions are correct. We take up the notions appearing in the Theorem in order of increasing difficulty. <p> The function length is not built-in, but we defined it in the obvious recursive way: 11 (defn length (lst) (if (listp lst) (add1 (length (cdr lst))) 0 )) This is exactly as suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>. We have found it convenient to represent sets as increasing lists of natural numbers, so that each set of numbers has a unique representation. Then (setp YY) says that "YY is a standard representation of a set".

Reference-contexts: The current Nqthm distribution contains a short Nqthm script, due to Kunen, which defines the Ackermann function and derives some of its properties. However, ! 2 is a long way from * 0 . The earliest use of * 0 in proof theory is due to Gentzen <ref> [3] </ref>, who showed that in PRA plus * 0 induction one can prove the consistency of PA. It might be an interesting exercise to implement this proof on Nqthm. However, in this paper, we choose instead a simple combinatorial theorem namely, the Paris-Harrington version of Ramsey's Theorem. <p> Actually, [4] proves this just for ff = !, which was sufficient to derive the Paris-Harrington Ramsey Theorem. 2 Now, the Ordinal Ramsey Theorem is done within PRA. Following Gentzen <ref> [3] </ref>, and Boyer-Moore [2], each ordinal below * 0 has a notation, which is a finite symbolic expression, and everything we need about ordinals is proved using ordinary induction on these notations. We only step beyond PRA in the proof that ff large sets exist.
