Reference-contexts: In legal reasoning it is not only important to flnd good cases; there should also be no stronger counterexample. Thus a comparison between several cases is involved in the tutoring system CATO in the fleld of trade secrets law <ref> [1] </ref>. Finding a protein in a protein case base that flts a given nucleotid sequence is a special kind of string matching [19].

Reference-contexts: In CAPLAN (Computer Aided Planning), used for cutting rotary-symmetric workpieces on a lathe, the decision tree reects the manufacturing process, for instance the type of machines needed [16]. The general case retrieval system ReMind is used in several flelds for a hierarchical search <ref> [2] </ref>. KICS (Knowledge-Intensive Case-based reasoning System) is applied to legal problems, in particular Scottish building law (regulations and former cases) [22]. Building plans are to be checked on rule conformity. The hierarchy corresponds to legal theory.

Reference-contexts: In CLASH, cases consist of facts representing the problem part, other facts representing the solution part and complete or partial explanations of the solution facts by the problem facts <ref> [3] </ref>. Given a new case with facts for the problem and the desired solution, one is looking for old cases where this solution is derived or at least made plausible by the facts. CASEY has a well-chosen case base of about two dozen patients with heart failures [13].

Reference-contexts: The model has to cope with biological peculiarities like three frames to read the DNA string (shifted by one position), reading the complimentary string in opposite direction and sequencing errors (substitutions, omissions). Syntactic and semantic similarity of a set of formulas is deflned and investigated in <ref> [4] </ref>, partially implemented in the Fabel module SYN [5]. The syntactic similarity is related to the least general anti-unifler; the semantic similarity takes also into account transformations according to equational theories (these express the semantics). 6 Hierarchically structured similarities Sometimes the similarity judgement is hierarchically structured.

Reference-contexts: The similarity is a function of the distances between corresponding end points or perhaps a function of the length of the path that can be reused (thus permitting to assemble the solution from several cases). Two examples are a square world of 2 n 2 n flelds containing obstacles <ref> [6] </ref> and the geographical problem to flnd the best connection between two points in a city using a huge city map [12]. There are many ways to modify the simple schemes. The points in the grid may have types or weights. A scaling of the distances may be permitted.

Reference-contexts: Rotations and resizing are permitted; thus the only invariants are angles. A problem in three-dimensional space is to flnd molecules of similar structure. A set of related programs has been developed for this purpose <ref> [7] </ref>. A third type of geometric problems is route flnding. In a given environment, flnd the best path (shortest in distance or time or money) between two points. The case base contains known paths.

Reference-contexts: All cases can be incorporated into the same decision tree; the search time has a remarkable property: it is independent of the size of the case base. The Fabel component Topo transforms the graph isomorphism problem into the clique detection problem <ref> [8] </ref>. Topo flnds easily the most similar subgraphs in a graph corresponding to several thousand objects with several hundred thousand topological relations. For this reason, it is not necessary to cut a building into sizeable cases; the whole building is a case.

Reference-contexts: An example is ODM (Object Density Matrix), developed in the Fabel project. It recognizes several classes of objects and compares the density of a class in geometric segments of a case <ref> [9] </ref>. The second problem type is more general. A case may now consist of a set of typed objects in two- (or three-) dimensional space. The retrieval goal is to flnd a case where as many objects as possible agree in type and these objects agree in their relative position. <p> The reports on case retrieval systems give very few hints on the quality of the search results. Assessment of the results is already a problem with document retrieval. It become harder with case retrieval; for a deeper discussion see <ref> [9] </ref>. There are at least two areas where a larger variety of case retrieval algorithms had been expected: geography and picture recognition. Apart from the route planning system mentioned in Section 2 and two forest flre projects, no geographical case retrieval systems have been found.

Reference-contexts: We will classify case retrieval systems primarily according to the case structure but with an empirical touch: we will not develop a theoretical classiflcation scheme for conceivable systems but rather try to classify the existing ones. This article is a highly condensed version of a Fabel report <ref> [10] </ref>, which provides many additional examples 1 . Similarity is also involved in many procedures outside case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Here the similarity has two components, the number of objects with matching type and the distance between corresponding objects. An example for the arrangement of typed objects is <ref> [11] </ref>. It assumes that there is at most one object of each type in a case so that the mutual assignment is trivial. Rotations and resizing are permitted; thus the only invariants are angles. A problem in three-dimensional space is to flnd molecules of similar structure.

Reference-contexts: Given a new case with facts for the problem and the desired solution, one is looking for old cases where this solution is derived or at least made plausible by the facts. CASEY has a well-chosen case base of about two dozen patients with heart failures <ref> [13] </ref>. Given a new patient, it searches for cases displaying similar symptoms; the weight of an attribute depends on the importance for explaining the diagnose in the retriev ed case. CASEY then tries to reconcile any difierences using an elaborate domain model, the Heart Failure Program.

Reference-contexts: Generalizing a step further, the weight of some attributes may depend on the value of others. A quite general, object-oriented program for attribute-based case retrieval is RABIT, developed in the Fabel project <ref> [14] </ref>. There are a number of elementary similarity functions for various types of attributes.

Reference-contexts: One has to distinguish graphs with directed or undirected arcs; nodes and edges may be typed (labeled). The exponential search time for flnding exactly matching typed subgraphs can be replaced by exponential storage space (neglecting the time to construct it) <ref> [15] </ref>. All cases can be incorporated into the same decision tree; the search time has a remarkable property: it is independent of the size of the case base. The Fabel component Topo transforms the graph isomorphism problem into the clique detection problem [8].

Reference-contexts: Sometimes it is artiflcially generated by clustering the available cases, perhaps to avoid checking all of them at retrieval time. In CAPLAN (Computer Aided Planning), used for cutting rotary-symmetric workpieces on a lathe, the decision tree reects the manufacturing process, for instance the type of machines needed <ref> [16] </ref>. The general case retrieval system ReMind is used in several flelds for a hierarchical search [2]. KICS (Knowledge-Intensive Case-based reasoning System) is applied to legal problems, in particular Scottish building law (regulations and former cases) [22]. Building plans are to be checked on rule conformity.

Reference-contexts: The propagation of activations has in principle exponential complexity. In the system BankXX, legal theories (formalisations of laws and former judgements) and legal cases are arranged in a net using several dozen difierent types of edges (among others, 8 qualities of citations) <ref> [17] </ref>. IDA, the Innovative Design by Analogy, sets out to apply known cases to semantically distant problems [21]. For this purpose, cases in the semantic net have the components structure, behaviour and function.

Reference-contexts: Some case retrieval algorithms are expensive; then one may preselect candidates by a simple algorithm and apply the expensive one only to this subset. An innovative method combining several retrieval algorithms has been developed in Fabel, ASPECT <ref> [18] </ref>. Distances between cases in the case base according to several criteria are computed beforehand and stored, if they exceed a limit. At search time, the individual distances can be combined freely. The precomputed distances are used to reject (or delay) cases near a retrieved, but dissimilar case.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, it is not necessary to cut a building into sizeable cases; the whole building is a case. Fabel has also implemented a general backtracking algorithm for flnding the largest common subgraph <ref> [20] </ref>. 4 Semantic nets In the methods of the present section we do not deal with separate cases in a case base; rather all the retrievable knowledge has been tied together into a large semantic net.

For this purpose, cases in the semantic net have the components structure, behaviour and function. The "knowledge-directed spreading activation (KDSA)" looks for cases with high similarity in function to the search case, but low similarity in structure and behaviour.
