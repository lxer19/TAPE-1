Reference-contexts: This experiment grew out of a desire to empirically test our intuitions. 3. Previous Research There is already an extensive literature on the evaluation of computer pointing devices which spans twenty years of research <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. The commonly accepted paradigm for evaluation of pointing uses tasks designed around Fitts Law, which predicts movement time as a function of the distance and width of the target from the starting position. <p> Additionally, since it is the most widely studied and best understood of computer pointing devices, using the mouse allows us to compare our work to a broad body of research on human pointing performance (see references <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>). One final description of equipment concerns the non-HMD condition of the normal desktop display.

Reference-contexts: Other research on using the HMD for extended periods is being conducted by Mann. In reference <ref> [7] </ref> he reports on his experience varying the quality of the display and the resulting effect on his performance. Pausch & Schackelford measured how a head-tracking feature in a HMD could improve performance on a desktop display in [8]. 4. <p> In translucent mode it is evident that participants were not distracted by seeing through the HMD. Using the HMD, they were able to rest their head in a comfortable position while they concentrated on the display. Similarly, in his technical report <ref> [7] </ref>, Steve Mann cites a preference for using a HMD in his everyday life. He finds it useful outside the laboratory, similar to reading a book or newspaper.

Method Using a standard experimental method, we studied movement times and error rates of subjects who performed over 600 pointing task trials using three different display configurations and a standard computer mouse as the pointing device.
