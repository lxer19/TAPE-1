Abstract: The expected time for a random walk on an undirected graph G = (V; E) to visit all the vertices is O(jV jjEj) [AKLLR], and is O(jV j 2 ) for regular graphs [KLNS]. Here we show that both bounds hold even if we are required to traverse all the edges, although our bound for regular graphs requires that the degree be jV j ffi for some ffi &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: Thus the results of e.g. [Ma] imply that c e = O (t max log m + m log m). For those graphs having c v = (t max log n), such as the hypercube and k-dimensional toruses for k &gt; 1 (see <ref> [A1] </ref> and [Z]), this is tight to within a constant factor. This is because c e c v , c v = O (t max log n) (see e.g. [Ma]), and that c e = (m log m) (see [A2]).

For general graphs, however, it gives a bound of c e = O (mn log n). To improve this to O (mn), we prove the following lemma: Lemma 2 For any positive integer k, c e = O (k (c v + m 1+ 1 k )). Proof.

Reference-contexts: This makes random walks very useful in computation, where limited resources are available to determine global information.

Aleliunas et. al. [AKLLR] showed that the expected time to visit all the vertices, called the cover time, is O (jV jjEj). <p> Bounds on the time of random walks to visit all vertices were important in showing that UNDIRECTED st-CONNECTIVITY can be computed in RSPACE (log n) <ref> [AKLLR] </ref> and in analyzing the simulation of token rings on arbitrary networks [BK]. Aleliunas et. al. [AKLLR] showed that the expected time to visit all the vertices, called the cover time, is O (jV jjEj). A natural extension is the expected time to traverse all the directed edges, where a random walk traverses directed edge (v; w) if it visits v and w consecutively. <p> Proof. E v T v;w &lt; E w T v;w = E v;w T v;w = m, where this last equality is a standard fact (see e.g. <ref> [AKLLR] </ref>). To get the most obvious upper bound on c e , we note that for any two edges e 1 and e 2 , E e 1 T e 2 t max + m.

Reference-contexts: The most natural method gives a bound of O (jV jjEj log jV j). In this note we obtain a bound of O (jV jjEj) for this problem. For regular graphs, Kahn et. al. <ref> [KLNS] </ref> have improved the bound on visiting all vertices to O (jV j 2 ). Here again the most natural way to prove a similar result about traversing all directed edges adds a log jV j factor, giving O (jV j 2 log jV j).
