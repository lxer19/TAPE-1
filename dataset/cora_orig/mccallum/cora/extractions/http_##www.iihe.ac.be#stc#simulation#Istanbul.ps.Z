Abstract: This article describes the structure of AMS, Atelier for Modeling and Simulating communication systems. Setting up a such atelier is the main objective of the OSISIM project. This atelier is meant to be able to model and simulate complex systems, and it is based on an extensible library of basic models. The atelier gives the end-user powerful tools to edit a communication system in a graphical environment. Each model implements uniform and well-defined sets of functions, while having clearly specified interfaces. In addition, the article focuses on the internal structure of basic models to be applied to each component of the library. The availability of good software tools is vital to simulation practitioners in the communication system field. Besides, the system being studied is so complex that it is almost impossible to model it on one shot. An alternate approach, is to divide the system into a collection of less complex subsystems. Each one has to be separately modeled. So, the overall system model will be constructed by linking the concerned subsystems. In order to allow reusability, subsystems corresponding to existing models may be identified, and isolated. The idea is to isolate the maximum of subsystems to be reused, to model them and to make them available. Based on this strategy, AMS (Cohen and Mrabet 1993a, 1994a) the atelier for Modeling and Simulating, has been developed for the OSISIM project (Open System Integrated Simulator). This atelier is built around a library of basic models which includes the most standard networks such as LANs, WANs, and satellite networks. In addition, it integrates facilities and tools to build an architecture of a communication system, and to study its performances. The basic models are constructed in a very modular way. Each basic model, called Detailed Basic Models (DBM), corresponds to a subsystem, and is detailed so as to reflect its exact behavior. It implements uniform and well-defined sets of functions, while having clearly specified interfaces. To facilitate carrying out the models, their interconnection and their maintenance, an internal structure is proposed, and has to be applied to each model candidate to be in the library. To be operational in a reasonable time, the AMS has been designed on the basis of existing packages rather than starting from scratch. QNAP2 (Queueing Network Analysis Package 2), GSS4 (Graphical Support System 4) and MODLINE are the main packages that are used to operate the AMS. Based on those tools, a prototype has been implemented. It is operational on Sun workstations where a specific user interface has been developed which allows the end-user to describe his architecture in a graphical manner. The description can also be made textually by using the specific language ADL (Architectural Description Language) (Cohen & Mrabet 1994b) designed for this purpose. This can be done in the same machine, or in another one. AMS is designed in a modular manner. The main modules constituting the AMS are structured in four phases, each of them is handled by one or several processes. The figure below illustrates this structure. Processes are accessible by the end-user in a graphical and/or a textual manner. The two modes are identified on the figure below by the labels G and T. Besides, the atelier is based on the library of basic models constructed in a very modular fashion to allow more flexibility. This library is the main core of the AMS.

Reference-contexts: The division adopted allows a high degree of modularity and hence the portability. The atelier is operational, and this has been proved by using it to study a concrete architecture consisting of a communication system based on a satellite backbone <ref> (Cohen & Mrabet 1993b) </ref>. 5.
