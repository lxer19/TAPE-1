Abstract: Precise failure analysis requires accurate fault diagnosis. A previously proposed method for diagnosing bridging faults using single stuck-at dictionaries was applied only to small circuits, produced large and imprecise diagnoses, and did not take into account the Byzantine Generals Problem for bridging faults. We analyze the original technique and improve it by introducing the concepts of match restriction, match requirement, and failure recovery. Our new technique, which requires no information other than that used by standard stuck-at methods, produces diagnoses that are an order of magnitude smaller than those produced by the original technique and produces many fewer misleading diagnoses than that of traditional stuck-at diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: Because gate input logic thresholds are not identical, different downstream gates can interpret the voltage as different logic values: This phenomenon is known as the Byzantine Generals Problem for bridging faults <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Figure 1 shows a simple example of voltage interpretation in the presence of variable logic thresholds. This behavior has important implications for diagnosis: a bridging fault need not mimic a single stuck-at fault for any one test vector.

Reference-contexts: Diagnosing bridging faults with single stuck-at fault information is an appealing idea, but this approach can lead to unusably large diagnoses or an unacceptable percentage of misleading diagnoses. To address these deficiencies, Aitken and Maxwell built dictionaries comprised of realistic faults <ref> [3] </ref>. While there are obvious advantages to this approach, the number of realistic faults in a circuit is significantly larger than the number of single stuck-at faults for a circuit, and the cost of simulating each individual realistic fault is frequently much greater.

Reference-contexts: However, the MMA technique, like other techniques, has the disadvantages of intractable diagnosis size and assumption of identical down-stream logic thresholds [5]. In addition, the MMA technique was originally demonstrated only on circuits smaller than any of those in the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits <ref> [4] </ref>. By removing vectors that cannot detect a bridging fault from its composite signature (match restriction), and requiring vectors that should detect it (match requirement), we have reduced the average diagnosis size by more than an order of magnitude. <p> In Section 5 we show that up to 10% of our diagnostic trials resulted in incorrect diagnoses because of the Byzantine Generals Problem. 4 Experimental considerations We implemented the MMA technique and applied it to the MCNC layouts of the ISCAS-85 circuits <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For diagnostic trials, we created faulty output responses for the 10% of realistic bridging faults that are most likely to occur based on layout and defect density information, although the process of diagnosis considers all realistic faults as potential candidates. 4.2 Bridging fault simulation The Nemesis bridging fault simulator <ref> [7, 14] </ref> produced the observed faulty behaviors used to evaluate the MMA technique. Note that bridging fault simulation is used only to determine faulty output responses to be diagnosed and not as part of the diagnostic procedure. <p> The simulator also extensively models feedback bridging faults. If a feedback bridging fault evidences the potential to oscillate or hold state, as verified by the Test Guarantee Theorem <ref> [7] </ref>, the simulator biases the bridge voltage in favor of the fault free value on the rear bridged node, thereby disallowing oscillation and state-holding behavior. This approximation is very accurate when the feedback path is short.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we investigate and improve a bridging fault diagnosis technique using the single stuck-at fault model that was proposed by Millman, Mc-Cluskey, and Acken (henceforth called the MMA technique) <ref> [17] </ref>. The MMA technique has many advantages, the most notable of which are the ubiquitous single stuck-at fault model, the obviation of the need for additional circuit information for bridging fault diagnosis, and the absence of misleading diagnoses.

The fault ordering method penalizes candidate stuck-at faults for each predicted failure that did not actually occur and for each failure that occurs without being predicted by the candidate. This procedure produces a ranked list of stuck-at faults.
