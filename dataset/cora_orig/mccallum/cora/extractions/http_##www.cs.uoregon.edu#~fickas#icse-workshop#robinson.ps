Abstract: It has been suggested that requirements inconsistency can be managed without consideration of inconsistency resolutions. In this position paper, we suggest such an approach is akin to analyzing specifications without regard to implementation, or defining decision goals without consideration of their means of satisfaction. Inconsistency management without consideration for resolutions addresses one part of the inconsistency management life-cycle. As such, it is useful, but it does not address a significant part of inconsistency management. Indeed, this position paper argues that a key part of inconsistency management is the management of the process of understanding how inconsistency can be resolved and how alternative resolutions affect the overall requirements. agement of the development process becomes a larger problem. Inconsistencies are a fundamental part of the development process. We define an inconsistency to include requirements errors (e.g., incorrect facts, omissions, inconsistencies, and ambiguities), as well as errors in the development process (e.g., improper application or ordering of transformations). We use the term inconsistency to indicate a difference between representations, or between a representation and a (consistency, completeness) rule. While some inconsisten
