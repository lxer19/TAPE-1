Abstract: Weaknesses in several recently proposed ideas about congestion control and avoidance in high-speed networks are identified. Both sides of the debate concerning prior-reservation of resources versus walk-in service, open-loop control versus feedback control, rate control versus window control, and router-based control versus source-based control are presented. The circumstances under which backpressure is useful or not useful are discussed, and it is argued that a single congestion scheme is not sufficient, but that a combination of several schemes is required for complete congestion management in a network.

Reference-contexts: This view should not be taken to mean that these ideas are not worth of pursuit. The purpose is to present both sides of issues, permitting an objective comparison of the alternatives. This paper begins with several old myths about congestion that were presented in an earlier paper <ref> [1] </ref> and is followed with a number of new myths. The new myths are based on a number of assumptions about the high-speed network. The remainder of the paper discusses the validity of these assumptions. <p> The new myths are based on a number of assumptions about the high-speed network. The remainder of the paper discusses the validity of these assumptions. Old Myths An overview of the congestion problem and the factors that affect its design along was presented in Jain <ref> [1] </ref>. In that paper, the following statements were shown to be false: 1. Congestion is caused by a shortage of buffer space. The problem will be solved when the cost for memory becomes cheap enough to allow infinitely Large mem ories. 2. Congestion is caused by slow links. <p> If not one, then all of the above developments will eliminate the congestion prob lem. These old myths are based on the belief that as resources become less expensive, the problem of congestion will automatically be solved. It was shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that increasing memory sizes, processor speeds, and link bandwidths has actually aggravated the congestion problem. Proper inclusion of congestion management and avoidance mechanisms in protocol design is more important today than ever before. New Myths A number of new myths have been observed since that earlier paper was published.

Reference-contexts: However, not all possible combinations may be acceptable. A switch that can process 1 packet per millisecond may not be able to handle 5 packets arriving back-to-back every 5 milliseconds (see Figure 2). Therfore, all rate-based schemes, including the popular leaky bucket <ref> [2] </ref> and its variations [3,4,5,6], require specifying the burst size and the interburst interval. Analytical models of rate-based controls generally ignore the two parameters and instead model the arrival process with a single parameter = n=T .

Reference-contexts: Most discussions on rate-based control, such as a leaky bucket scheme and its variations, are limited to admission control. These may work on networks with small number of hops but will need to be supplemented by switch/router mechanisms for large networks. Recently, Golestani <ref> [7] </ref> has proposed a stop-and-go service policy that allows rate enforcement at intermediate nodes. Third, with dynamic rate-based controls there is a possibility of significant increase in packet queue when the total input rate is close to the capacity.

Third, with dynamic rate-based controls there is a possibility of significant increase in packet queue when the total input rate is close to the capacity. Leland <ref> [8] </ref> shows that rate-based controls result in a higher total delay (including delay at the source queue, as well as in the network) and a higher loss rate than window-based controls at loads in excess of 60% of the capacity.

Reference-contexts: Window sizes in 8 current systems are 1 to 32 packets. When used as a backup to a rate-based control, the window sizes would be one or two orders of magnitude higher. Such a combination has recently been proposed Keshav <ref> [9] </ref>. This discussion of window-based versus rate-based controls is summarized in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: In the past, many congestion management schemes proposed that the routers send a feedback signal to the sources, which will initiate remedial control action increasing or decreasing the load. Examples of source-based controls include the slow-start <ref> [10] </ref>, CUTE [11], the DECbit [12], and the Q-bit [13] schemes. There are several arguments against source-based controls. First, these controls have a significant delay time between sensing the congestion and taking the remedial action.

Reference-contexts: Third, in some schemes the feedback requires that additional packets be injected into the network. The router-based controls do not suffer from these problems since they evenly distribute their resources without relying on the sources. Shenker <ref> [14] </ref> has proven that router-based controls are necessary for fairness and that source-based controls can achieve efficiency, but may not always be fair. Examples of router-based controls are random-drop policy [15], fair queueing [16], and backpressure.

Reference-contexts: Implicit feedback schemes, such as those using delay [17,18] as the signal, are more desirable. Another interesting proposal is to send one or more special coded packets so that in the event of a packet loss, information can be reconstructed at the destination without a retransmission <ref> [19] </ref>. With source-based controls, the source complexity can be different at different sources. Sources capable of generating high loads may have more sophisticated controls, than those generating low loads (for example, interactive traffic). The latter may have simple static controls, such as fixed small windows.

Reference-contexts: This is shown in Figure 3. The congestion at router R, spreads to several links (indicated by thick lines). The flow A, which does not use router R, is affected whenever flow B increases its load. Maxemchuk and Zarki <ref> [22] </ref> argue that the sharing of high speed links by a large number of sources will, by the law of large numbers, result in smooth traffic patterns. This in turn implies that short-duration overloads (short traffic peaks) are less likely in high-speed networks.

Reference-contexts: Since every network can have overloads of all durations, every network needs a combination of controls at various levels. No one scheme can solve all congestion problems. An example of a combined approach is given in a proposal by Eckberg, Luan, and Lucantoni <ref> [23] </ref>. This proposal requires a leaky bucket admission control for normal operation, a source-based control for packet loss, and a session-denial for longer term congestion. Another related issue is that of multiple competing schemes at the same level.
