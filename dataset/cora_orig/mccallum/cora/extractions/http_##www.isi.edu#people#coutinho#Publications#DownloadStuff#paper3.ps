Reference-contexts: worse case is the multivariable phase margin. 5 Topology and Geometry of Crossover and Stability Boundary 5.1 Crossover Topology In case the uncertainty enters in a polynomial fashion in det (I + L) the crossover X ! , characterized by det (I + L) = 0, becomes an algebraic variety <ref> [BocCosRoy] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: topology? A second motivation for this research is to provide some explanation as to whether some robust stability problems are "easy", the most typical example being Kharitonov's theorem, while other problems are "complicated", even to the point of being a N P -hard computation like the real structured singular values <ref> [CoxDeM] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this case f (D; !) is a rectangle and it is readily checked that Kharitonov's theorem passes the test f 1 @(Rectangle) @f 1 (Rectangle): A typical example of the failure of f 1 @ @f 1 is the real structured singular values problem <ref> [deGSaf] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Computationally, the simplicial approximation theorem and obstruction theory yield remarkably close results. To get a more accurate estimate of the multivariable margin, one could dissect the triangles using the 012 rule, and we would go through a process that Brouwer called localization of the degree, <ref> [Dieu, p. 178] </ref>, for indeed all of this can be reinterpreted in the context of the Brouwer degree. 18 4.2 Homotopy Classification A corollary to obstruction theory is a homotopy classification of all Nyquist maps defined over a given space of uncertainty D fi .

Reference-contexts: The Q-triangulation is a decomposition of a solution space that underlies many "simplicial algorithms" of operations research <ref> [Doup] </ref>. It turns out that many simplicial algorithms originally meant to operate on the Q-triangulation could also operate on the prismatic decomposition of D fi .

Reference-contexts: The Voronoi algorithm was implemented in a X window environment running on a SunSpark Station system, allowing a graphic interface for the original code written by Steven Fortune <ref> [For] </ref>. A sweepline technique was used to compute the Voronoi diagram and its dual, the Delauney triangulation, having a O (m log m) worst-case running time and using O (m) memory space (m=number of vertices).

Reference-contexts: Contrary to the 9 usual tic-tac-toe game, where a draw is possible, the game of Hex has always a winner. Many algorithms, all of them combinatorial in nature, have been devised to find a winning path on the Hex board <ref> [Gale] </ref>. Since, on the one hand, prismatic and Q-triangulations and, on the other hand, the Hex board have the same combinatorics, the algorithm for searching stability boundary on either the prismatic or Q-triangulation have a Hex board interpretation in terms of strategies for finding a winning path.

Reference-contexts: In addition to its computational usefulness, the stellar decomposition turns out to be a tool of combinatorial topology, as developed by <ref> [Gla] </ref>. An extra vertex a i;j of the refined triangulation is mapped into the vertex b k of the Voronoi cell in which f (a i;j ) falls (f (a i;j ) 2 V C (b k )). This established a simplicial map. <p> The difficulty is that, if D and are decomposed into simplexes, the product of a simplex of D and a simplex of is not a simplex. It is rather a prism. However, this prism can be decomposed into simplexes using a simple combinatorial rule. This yields the prismatic decomposition <ref> [Gla] </ref> of the Cartesian product of uncertainties. <p> If we come back to Sect. 2, we can draw a comparison in the case D fi is 3-D: The simplicial approximation theorem would say that a maximally labelled (0, 1, 2, 2) tetrahedron after collapse <ref> [Gla] </ref> along the edge 22 yields a 2-simplex that is completely labelled (0, 1, 2) and hence contains an instability. Obstruction theory would rather say the two 012 faces of the tetrahedron contain obstructions and hence elements of the crossover X ! .

Reference-contexts: Recently, the issue of continuity of the stability margin relative to "certain" parameters have come about and this problem can be attacked using the theory of the stability of maps in the spirit of <ref> [GolGui] </ref>. Observe that whenever the Nyquist map is stable, the crossover X ! computed from f and the perturbed crossover X 0 ! computed from a perturbed map f 0 are diffeomorphic.

Reference-contexts: In our view, the crucial issue of robust stability test is whether the Nyquist map and the boundary commute in the sense that f @(D fi ) @f (D fi ): If the answer is "yes", the problem is "easy". If the answer is "no", the problem is "difficult". <ref> [Horowitz, 4.12] </ref> was probably the first to have noted that a commutativity relation of the form f@ = @f could lead to a robust stability test drastically simplified compared with the "brute force" procedure of checking stability for all uncertain parameters.

Reference-contexts: the example was a 2 fi 2 loop transfer matrix L (s) of degree fl This research was supported by NSF Grant ECS-91-13088 1 4 (double spring-mass-dashpot) closed by a special unitary SU (2; C) per-turbation that was meant to model sensor delays and misalignment between inertial and body axes. <ref> [JonBar] </ref> provides a 3-D picture of the situation, clearly showing the complexity of the stability boundary on a 3-torus model of SU (2; C).

Reference-contexts: Each vertex b i is enclosed in a Voronoi cell 5 V C (b i ) consisting of all points that have b i as closest vertex. The straight-edge graph-theoretic dual of the Voronoi diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of N ; see <ref> [PreSha] </ref>. The critical step in the construction of a simplicial map is to find a refined polyhedron P 0 and a vertex transformation: a 0i 7! b i that induces a simplicial map: P 0 ! N .
