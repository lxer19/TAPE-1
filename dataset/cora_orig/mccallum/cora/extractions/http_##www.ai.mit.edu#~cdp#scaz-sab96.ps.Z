Abstract: The authors implemented a system which performs a fundamental visuomotor coordination task on the humanoid robot Cog. Cog's task was to saccade its pair of two degree-of-freedom eyes to foveate on a target, and then to maneuver its six degree-of-freedom compliant arm to point at that target. This task requires systems for learning to saccade to visual targets, generating smooth arm trajectories, locating the arm in the visual field, and learning the map between gaze direction and correct pointing configuration of the arm. All learning was self-supervised solely by visual feedback. The task was accomplished by many parallel processes running on a seven processor, extensible architecture,

Each eye can rotate about a vertical axis (pan) and a horizontal axis (tilt).

Reference-contexts: Second, reaching to a visually stimulating object is a skill that children develop at a very early age (before the 5th month), and the development of this skill is itself an active area of research <ref> (Diamond 1990) </ref>. Third, the task specification can be reformulated as a variety of behavioral responses. <p> In addition the motion is bounded by the convex hull of the primitives, which is useful if there are known obstacles to avoid (like the body of the robot!). 5.2 Reaching motion The reaching behavior takes inspiration from studies of child development <ref> (Diamond 1990) </ref>. Children always begin a reach from a rest position in front of their bodies. If they miss the target, they return to the rest position and try again. This reaching sequence is implemented in Cog's arm.

Reference-contexts: If ~ E is 1-to-1, then ~ B is single-valued and we need not worry about learning discontinuous or multiple output ranges. The learning techniques used here closely parallels the distal supervised learning approach <ref> (Jordan & Rumelhart 1992) </ref>. We actually learned the forward map ~ E as well as ~ B; this was necessitated by our training scheme. However, ~ E is useful in that it gives an expectation of where to look to find the arm.

Reference-contexts: These reflexes have also been implemented on Cog (Williamson 1996). The actual motion takes inspiration from observations of the smooth nature of human arm motions (Flash & Hogan 1985). To produce a movement, the joints of the arm are moved using a smooth, minimum jerk profile <ref> (Nelson 1983) </ref>. 6 Ballistic Map The ballistic map is a learned function ~ B mapping eye position ~e into arm position ~ff, such that the resulting arm configuration puts the end of the arm in the center of the visual field.

Reference-contexts: It has 6 degrees-of-freedom, each powered by a DC electric motor through a series spring (a series elastic actuator, see <ref> (Pratt & Williamson 1995) </ref>). The spring provides accurate torque feedback at each joint, and protects the motor gearbox from shock loads. A low gain position control loop is implemented so that each joint acts as if it were a virtual spring with variable stiffness, damping and equilibrium position.

Details on the application of this research to robotic arms can be found in <ref> (Williamson 1996) </ref>. In Cog's arm the primitives are implemented as a set of equilibrium angles for each of the arm joints, as shown in Figure 7.
