Abstract: The collision avoidance and resolution multiple access (CARMA) protocol is presented and analyzed. CARMA uses a collision avoidance handshake in which the sender and receiver exchange a request to send (RTS) and a clear to send (CTS) before the sender transmits any data. CARMA is based on carrier sensing, together with collision resolution based on a deterministic tree-splitting algorithm. For analytical purposes, an upper bound is derived for the average number of steps required to resolve collisions of RTSs using the tree-splitting algorithm. This bound is then applied to the computation of the average channel utilization in a fully connected network with a large number of stations. Under light-load conditions, CARMA achieves the same average throughput as multiple access protocols based on RTS/CTS exchange and carrier sensing. It is also shown that, as the arrival rate of RTSs increases, the throughput achieved by CARMA is close to the maximum throughput that any protocol based on collision avoidance (i.e., RTS/CTS exchange) can achieve if the control packets used to acquire the floor are much smaller than the data packet trains sent by the stations. Simulation results validate the simplifying approximations made in the analytical model. Our analysis results indicate that collision resolution makes floor acquisition multiple access much more effective.

Reference-contexts: The basic deterministic tree-splitting algorithm used in CARMA is much the same as the methods used in other protocols based on the identities of nodes. Many MAC protocols have been proposed based on collision resolution (e.g., RAMA <ref> [1] </ref>, TRAMA [9], DQRUMA [10], DQRAP [15]). The interesting feature in CARMA is the combination of a known collision resolution algorithm with RTS/CTS exchanges, which provides a stable and very efficient protocol that does not require time slotting or availability of base stations capable of detecting multiple simultaneous transmissions.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, even if every RTS has to go through collision resolution, the channel can still be used for useful data the majority of the time. In contrast, it is well known that tree-splitting algorithms do not provide much improvement for CSMA protocols <ref> [2] </ref>, which stems from the fact that the data packets themselves are used for collision resolution. <p> It is well known that a method to stabilize ALOHA and CSMA protocols is by means of collision resolution; however, because data packets are used to resolve collisions, the maximum throughput that can be achieved in a stable CSMA or ALOHA protocol is limited <ref> [2] </ref>. In contrast, CARMA (for collision avoidance and resolution multiple access) addresses the limitations of FAMA and contention-based protocols using carrier sensing for the transmission of RTSs (with which stations attempt to acquire the floor) and a tree-splitting algorithm to resolve collisions of RTSs. <p> Throughout this paper, we assume a simple tree-splitting algorithm for collision resolution, but more sophisticated algorithms <ref> [2] </ref> can be used instead. Each station must know the maximum number of stations allowed in the system and the maximum propagation delay in the network. 4 Garces, R. et al. / CARMA 2.1.

Reference-contexts: In this section we summarize a simple modification of the basic scheme intended for wireless LANs (WLANs) in which some stations may be hidden from others. Handling hidden terminals in CARMA is more difficult than in other MAC protocols based on collision avoidance (e.g., MACAW <ref> [3] </ref>, MACA [8], FAMA [5]) because all stations whose transmissions can impact one another must agree on the same state of the collision resolution algorithm, rather than just agreeing on allowing a given sender to transmit a packet without interference.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis of the average number of collisions and idle steps needed to resolve m collisions in a net of n nodes extends prior work on collision resolution, which focused in the total average number of steps needed <ref> [4] </ref>.

A busy period is composed of both the successful and the tree transmission periods. <p> 3 + fl + t )e t + 1 e t The average utilization is: U = ffi P s + ffim (1 P s ) = ffit (1 t e t ) (1 e t ) The average idle period is the same as in the slotted FAMA-NTR protocol <ref> [5] </ref> with the modification that we require a waiting period of 2t after each collision resolution period, i.e., I t 1 e t + 2t (4.11) Substituting Eqs. (4.9), (4.10),and (4.11) into Eq. (4.1) a lower bound on the average throughput of slotted CARMA can be written as in Eq. (4.6). <p> Our results on FAMA throughput are in agreement with the results presented in <ref> [5] </ref> with the exception of the I and T f which are bounded as in CARMA. Table 4 summarizes the protocol parameters used in our comparison. Figs. 3 and 4 show the average throughput (S) versus the offered load (G) for CARMA and FAMA-NTR.

Reference-contexts: The efficiency of FAMA protocols using carrier sensing to eliminate the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA has been verified and analyzed <ref> [6] </ref>. However, the throughput of a FAMA protocol still degrades rapidly once stations start retransmitting unsuccessful RTSs that collide repeatedly with other RTSs. <p> Fullmer and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [6] </ref> have demonstrated sufficient conditions for MAC protocols based on RTS/CTS exchanges to eliminate unwanted collisions due to hidden terminals. <p> For the case of MAC protocols that use carrier sensing, a CTS must be longer than the length of an RTS, plus a maximum round-trip time and processing delays (including radio turn-around times). The net effect of the CTS length suggested in <ref> [6] </ref> is that of a single-channel, receiver-based busy tone that forces hidden sources to back off after they are forced to listen to at least part of the CTS sent by a receiver that has accepted the RTS from a given sender.

Reference-contexts: other station, (b) the channel introduces no errors, so packet collisions are the only source of errors, (c) stations detect such collisions perfectly, (d) two or more transmissions that overlap in time in the channel must all be re-transmitted, (e) a packet propagates to all stations in exactly t seconds <ref> [11] </ref>, and (f) no failures occur. The binary tree is a structure defined on a finite set of nodes composed of three disjoint sets: a root node, a binary tree called a left subtree and a binary tree called a right subtree.

Reference-contexts: A floor acquisition strategy is very attractive in packet-radio networks, because it provides a building block to solve the hidden-terminal problem that arises in CSMA <ref> [14] </ref>. Variants of this basic strategy can be designed using different types of contention-based MAC protocols like ALOHA or CSMA to transmit RTSs into the channel, and three- or four-way handshakes can be implemented (i.e., RTS-CTS-DATA or RTS-CTS-DATA-ACK).
