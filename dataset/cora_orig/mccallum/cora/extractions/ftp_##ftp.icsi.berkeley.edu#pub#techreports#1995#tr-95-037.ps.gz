Abstract: The image of a word or a generic hand made drawing on a piece of paper is usually characterized by a series of interfering zones where the cursive trace intersects itself or printed lines already present on the writing surface. In this zone, the odometric information is ambiguous and any trivial inference on the original pen tip movement cannot be done. In this article, starting from some basic cognitive considerations, a general procedure is developed to analize a generic image of a word or a common hand made scribble. This approach allows to detect each ambiguity part of the image and then interpretate them to finally recover a part of the original temporal information.

Reference-contexts: the human visual system seems to exploit in a reverse operation, the same mechanism taking place during the generation: the image is analized in order to detect the corresponding sequence of primitive motor components which have then, to be interpreted on the basis of the general knowledge about motor control <ref> [1] </ref>, [7]. Finally, the syntactical class of the word (or the drawing) is determined. According to this motor approach to handwriting generation and recognition, a new paradigm for off-line cursive analysis and recognition can be set up.

Reference-contexts: space which is more handable by the analysis processes (wholistic approaches or thinning processes for example), this new approach tends to restore, among other things, the original odometric information by following in the image the sequence of pen movements to finally recover the original curvilinear trajectory of the pen tip <ref> [3] </ref>, [12], [6]. In this case, it is possible to preserve for the subsequent analysis process (word reconstruction and recognition), part of the original information that could be irreversibly destroyed otherwise during the above mentioned traditional models for word image processing.
