Abstract: Given a linear iteration of the form x := F (x), we consider modifled versions of the form x := F (x + d), where d is a flxed direction, and is chosen to minimize the norm of the residual kx + d F (x + d)k. We prop ose ways to choose d so that the convergence rate of the modifled iteration is governed by the sub dominan t eigenvalue of the original. In the special case where F relates to a Mark ovian decision problem, we obtain a new extrap olation metho d for value iteration. In particular, our metho d accelerates the Gauss-Seidel version of the value iteration metho d for discoun ted problems in the same way that MacQueen's error bounds accelerate the standard version. Furthermore, our metho d applies equally well to Mark ov Renew al and undiscoun ted problems.

Reference-contexts: The extrap olation metho d of MacQueen and subsequen t works are readily adapted to this more general context (see also the following discussion). By contrast this is not true for more sophisticated acceleration algorithms for linear systems, such as conjugate gradien t metho ds (e.g. <ref> [Axe80] </ref>), Lanczos metho ds (e.g. [CuW86]), or generalized minim um residual metho ds [SaS86], and this is probably the reason why these metho ds have not seen much use in Mark ovian decision problem computations.

This computation can b e exact, or can be appro ximate within the context of modifled policy iteration (see [PuS78], [Put90]). In the latter case, the appro ximate evaluation of a policy should of course include several iterations of the second phase. 5 2. <p> In this section we will presen t some computational results for sto chastic shortest path problems (also known as flrst passage problems ).

Reference-contexts: An alternativ e possibilit y is the use of adaptiv e aggregation metho ds that use extrap olation along low-dimensional time-v arying subspaces, such as those prop osed in <ref> [BeC89] </ref>. Another shortcoming of the two-phase metho d outlined ab ove when applied to Mark ovian decision problems is that it assumes a flxed policy.
