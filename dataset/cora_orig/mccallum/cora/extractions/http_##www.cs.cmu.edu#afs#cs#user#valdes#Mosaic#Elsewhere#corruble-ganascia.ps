Abstract: The work presented here tackles the problem of inductive reasoning in medical discoveries. The discovery of the causes of scurvy is studied and simulated using computational means. An inductive algorithm is successful i n simulating some essential steps in the progress of the understanding of the disease and also allows us to simulate the false reasoning of previous centuries through the introduction of some a priori knowledge inherited form pre-clinical medicine. These results confirm the good results obtained by other AI researchers with an inductive approach of discovery, and illustrate the importance of the social and cultural environment on the way the inductive inference is performed and on its outcome. This article explores the potentiality of symbolic induction for scientific discovery. As such, it is related to the data-driven line of research developed since the 70's in the study of computational models of scientific discovery (see for example [15] for a general presentation of this approach, and [13] for a presentation of the system BACON). However, the specific problem addressed here is original both with regards to the application domain, and to the actual task studied. Work on computational models of scientific discovery has traditionally focused on hard science. Among them, the most important ones are undoubtedly physics and chemistry. A characteristic of these sciences is that they rest, at least over the last century, on relatively well-established formalisms. At the opposite, work on medicine is in large part based on the interpretation of symptoms, which are only pointing toward the underlying physiological phenomena. Medicine remains a rich domain to be explored by researchers interested in computational models of scientific discovery. It has been until now largely neglected by the AI community, except for a few notable exceptions (see for example [25] and [22]). The second originality is in the type of inference studied. As said above, induction has been studied extensively in the research on computational models of scientific discovery. However, the main tasks modeled with an inductive inference have been the induction of numerical laws with the Bacon family of systems, or the formation of taxonomies with

Reference-contexts: Soon after the development of clinical medicine, the field saw the development of experimental medicine. Experimental medicine is not opposed to clinical medicine because it is also based on observation. The main difference (beautifully analyzed in <ref> [2] </ref>), is that experimental medicine generates the observations to test a hypothesis already formulated, while clinical medicine is more passive (cognitive activity aside). Experimental medicine has been very successful and thus soon overshadowed the clinical revolution.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, research on the causes of scurvy attracted the brightest minds of the time. Among them, James Lind is famous for his remarkable Treatise of the Scurvy <ref> [16] </ref>. From the 17th to the 20th century (when the actual cause of the disease, i.e., the lack of vitamin C, was discovered), dozens of theories were put forward on the origins of the disease.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the examples used all come from the 1880 Dictionnaire Encyclopdique des Sciences Mdicales <ref> [17] </ref>, which provides relatively detailed descriptions of 25 cases of scurvy 2 . <p> The first point of interest is the parallel between the rules produced by CHARADE and the competing explanations proposed for the disease until the end of the 19th century and provided in <ref> [17] </ref>.

Corruble and J.G. <p> Ganascia special issue on Scientific Discovery 12 HYGIENE: If Cook's crews were entirely spared from scurvy, in a relatively large extent considering the times, it is thought that these great results were precisely the happy consequence of the care given to the cleanliness and drying of the ships. <ref> [17] </ref> Set II: Rules 5,6,9,12 use in their premises the level of hygiene. <p> CLIMATE: Spring and winter are obviously the seasons of predominance for scurvy. <ref> [17] </ref> Set III: Rules 1, 11 use in their premises the temperature. R1: IF location = land, temperature hot THEN affectionseverity 0. [4] R11: IF temperature severe-cold THEN affectionseverity 1. [5] followed by the corresponding rules proposed by CHARADE. <p> The influence of a cold and humid atmosphere has been said to be the key factor for the apparition of scurvy. "Air humidity is the main predisposing cause of this disease", according to Lind. <ref> [17] </ref> CHARADE does not conclude that the humidity of the air has any impact on the presence or absence of the disease, even though this was the most widely accepted theory in the 18th and 19th century.

Reference-contexts: In these experiments, the inductive bias seems to have a harmful effect, since it hides the real cause of scurvy. However, it is obviously not our goal to convince the reader that the inductive bias is harmful by nature. We know (especially from machine learning research <ref> [18] </ref>) that in most cases of induction, even more importantly in cases of human induction, a bias is necessary to constraint the search space. However, a lesson from our research is that it is critical to take into account one's induction bias to understand one's reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we use the number of individual cases explained by each subset of rules as a criterion. This is indirectly related to the concept of consilience [24] and verisimilitude <ref> [19] </ref> except (this is a significant difference) that these refer to classes of facts explained rather than individual cases.

Reference-contexts: Scurvy has been the cause of over a million of deaths aboard commercial and navy ships, and also on land, though to a lesser extent <ref> [1, 20] </ref>. The disease took on an increased importance in the 15th century, with the development of long circumnavigations [4], and also in the 17th and 18th century, with the development of long missions in European navies, which involved numerous seamen.

Reference-contexts: CHARADE is thus able to generate all such nonredundant regularities, but it can also be restricted to generate rules verifying some particular properties corresponding to what is called a learning bias in the area of Machine Learning (see for instance <ref> [27, 21, 10] </ref>). The aim of this paper is not to explain the Artificial Intelligence Journal V. Corruble and J.G. Ganascia special issue on Scientific Discovery 7 theory of CHARADE.

Reference-contexts: Medicine remains a rich domain to be explored by researchers interested in computational models of scientific discovery. It has been until now largely neglected by the AI community, except for a few notable exceptions (see for example [25] and <ref> [22] </ref>). The second originality is in the type of inference studied. As said above, induction has been studied extensively in the research on computational models of scientific discovery. <p> We are here more interested in an informal, exploratory prior-assessment as it can be done in medical research to decide which hypothesis to pursue (the concepts of prior-assessment and pursuit are well explained in <ref> [22] </ref>). Therefore we use the number of individual cases explained by each subset of rules as a criterion. This is indirectly related to the concept of consilience [24] and verisimilitude [19] except (this is a significant difference) that these refer to classes of facts explained rather than individual cases.

Reference-contexts: We come back later on the relation between induction and causality in the context of medicine. One of the rare computational applications of induction of causal hypotheses can be found in the system TETRAD <ref> [23] </ref>, yet this system manipulates numeric data and is deeply entrenched in a probabilistic framework, it is therefore only slightly related to our focus on symbolic induction.

Reference-contexts: Another important issue for any work based on historical data is the choice of focus on normative (what should have been done by the scientist) or descriptive models (what was actually done by the scientist). This distinction is explored in detail in <ref> [24] </ref>: Normative focus was traditionally chosen in philosophy of science (until the development of historical philosophy of science), logic and also generally in Artificial Intelligence. Descriptive approaches are more common in history of science. <p> Therefore we use the number of individual cases explained by each subset of rules as a criterion. This is indirectly related to the concept of consilience <ref> [24] </ref> and verisimilitude [19] except (this is a significant difference) that these refer to classes of facts explained rather than individual cases.
