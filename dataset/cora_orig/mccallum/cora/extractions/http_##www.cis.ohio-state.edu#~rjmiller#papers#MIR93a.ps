Abstract: Before the problem of schema integration and translation can be adequately addressed, a precise understanding of schemas is needed. We present an analysis of the notion of schema as used by existing integration methodologies. We show how inherent ambiguities and imprecision in traditional definitions of schema can hamper the development of formal schema integration methodologies. Specifically, traditional notions of schema contain data in the form of metadata, as well as superfluous structuring information that is not semantically meaningful. We argue that it is important to cleanly separate structural information from data, and remove from consideration artifacts of a specific data model or design methodology. To this end, we introduce the notion of a schema intension to capture the semantic content of a schema.

Reference-contexts: To meet this expectation, the derivation of schema intensions must be based on a formal notion of equivalence. We are exploring the application of existing work on relative information capacity to schema intensions <ref> [4] </ref>. Once schema intensions are derived, formal reasoning about their equivalence is possible. We are examining whether a set of inference rules over schema intensions that is not only sound (produces logically valid inferences) but complete (produces all inferences that are sound) may be developed.

Reference-contexts: We present a simple, intuitive formalism for capturing the essence of schema intensions called schema intension graphs (SIGs). We present only the features of SIGs necessary to present the example of Section 3 (SIGs are fully defined in <ref> [7] </ref>). The notion of a schema intension is independent of the specific model we present below. Our exposition will therefore focus on the use of this model in demonstrating the principles underlying the analysis of schemas using schema intensions. <p> Inference rules allow annotated binary relations to be combined and simplified. (Derivation rules for classes of the relational model and inference rules on SIGs are presented elsewhere <ref> [7] </ref>.) In the following we focus on the intuition behind the derivation of annotated binary relations. The structure on nodes implied by the stock table of Schema I can be captured by SIG I of Figure 2. <p> We are examining whether a set of inference rules over schema intensions that is not only sound (produces logically valid inferences) but complete (produces all inferences that are sound) may be developed. We have shown this problem to be incomplete in general <ref> [7] </ref>. However, there are interesting subsets of schema intensions (of practical importance) for which a complete set of inference rules may be given. These rules may be used to formally establish the equivalence of schema intensions.
