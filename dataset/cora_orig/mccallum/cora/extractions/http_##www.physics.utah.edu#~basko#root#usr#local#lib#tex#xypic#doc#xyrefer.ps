Abstract: This manual summarises the capabilities of the X Y -pic package for typesetting graphs and diagrams in T E X. z The "/3fi" in the version is meant to indicate that this is a fi-test version of X Y -pic version 3 currently under development by the authors, thus this manual contains a few `Bug' and `To Do' paragraphs describing facilities not yet fully implemented. ? :@/_.5pc/ _y "Y" , We will not describe the combination of features in this manual: refer to the User's Guide [14] for a tutorial on how diagrams like the above can be typeset.

Reference-contexts: Rose hkris@diku.dki Load as: "xyoption-graph This option implements `X Y -graph', a special combinatoric drawing language suitable for diagrams like flow charts, directed graphs, and various forms of trees. The base of the language is reminiscent of the PIC <ref> [4] </ref> language because it uses a notion of the `current location' and is based on `moves'. But the central construction is a `map' combinator that is borrowed from functional programming. X Y -graph make use of facilities of the `arrow' feature option which is therefore required. notes below.
