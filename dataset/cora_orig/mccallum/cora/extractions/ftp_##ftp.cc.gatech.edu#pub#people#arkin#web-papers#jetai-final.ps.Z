Abstract: This paper reviews key concepts of the Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA). Its structure, strengths, and roots in biology are presented. AuRA is a hybrid deliberative/reactive robotic architecture that has been developed and refined over the past decade. In this article, particular focus is placed on the reactive behavioral component of this hybrid architecture. Various real world robots that have been implemented using this architectural paradigm are discussed, including a case study of a multiagent robotic team that competed and won the 1994 AAAI Mobile Robot Competition.

In the style of a traditional hierarchical planning system as found in the intelligent controls community <ref> [1, 38, 47] </ref>, the highest level of AuRA is a Mission Planner concerned with establishing high level goals for the robot and the constraints within which it must operate.

Their continued development in the intelligent controls community has led to a diversity of approaches (e.g., [38, 47]) that are characterized by predictable and predetermined communication between layers and where each layer's functionality varies in both spatial extent and time criticality.

Reference-contexts: Each motor schema receives sensory data from an associated perceptual schema and generates its reaction to the stimulus in the form of a vector. Biological similarities to this form of motor control have been observed in the navigation of a toad <ref> [3] </ref>, and limb control within the spinal cord of a frog [40]. The justification for hybridization of reactive and deliberative control can be found in studies by psychologists such as Norman and Shallice [42] and Neisser [41].

Within AuRA, schemas are employed at the reactive control level, and are encoded using an analog of the potential fields method [32].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA) was developed in the mid-1980's as a hybrid approach to robotic navigation <ref> [6] </ref>. Hybridization arises from the presence of two distinct components: a deliberative or hierarchical planner, based on traditional artificial intelligence techniques; and a reactive controller, based upon schema theory [2]. It was the first robot navigational system to be presented in this integrative manner [8, 10]. <p> In AuRA-based systems constructed to date, the Mission Planner has acted primarily as an interface to a human commander. The Spatial Reasoner, originally referred to as the Navigator in <ref> [6] </ref>, uses cartographic knowledge stored in long-term memory to construct a sequence of path legs which the robot must execute to complete its mission. In the first implementation of AuRA, this planner used the A* algorithm to search over a meadow map (hybrid free space/vertex graph) representation [7]. <p> The generalizability of AuRA to a wide range of problems is another strength. Various architectural components have been applied in a variety of domains including: 3 * Manufacturing environments [18]. * Three Dimensional navigation as found in aerial or undersea domains [14]. * Indoor and outdoor navigation <ref> [6] </ref>. * Robot competitions [15, 19]. * Vacuuming [36]. * Military scenarios [37, 20]. * Mobile Manipulation [23]. * Multi-robot teams [13, 21]. Several of these robotic systems are described in in more detail in Section 4. <p> AuRA, as described in this paper, first appeared in 1986-87 <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. Other hybrid architectures followed: including Connell's SSS [26], Gat's Atlantis [28], Lyons' Planner-Reactor [34] and Georgeff's PRS [29]. Each differs in its overall structure, control methods, emphasis, and interfaces between the deliberative and reactive components. <p> This robot was controlled remotely either via a wire tether or a radio link from a Digital Vax computer. HARV was the testbed upon which the first implementations of motor schemas were investigated <ref> [9, 6] </ref>. George was the first robot acquired at Georgia Tech when the AuRA project relocated from the University of Massachusetts. It is a Denning DRV-I robot similar to HARV.

Reference-contexts: In the first implementation of AuRA, this planner used the A* algorithm to search over a meadow map (hybrid free space/vertex graph) representation <ref> [7] </ref>. The Plan Sequencer, referred to as the Pilot in earlier work, translates each path leg generated by the Spatial Reasoner into a set of motor behaviors for execution. In the original implementation, the Plan Sequencer was a rudimentary rule-based system. <p> The system ran successfully, but difficulties with sensors led to poor performance on the day of the contest. Another example of integration between deliberative and reactive components of AuRA concerns the Spatial Reasoner, originally implemented in HARV using an A* meadow-map algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. The meadow-map approach was replaced with Router [31], a multi-strategy planner. Router models navigable routes as links between nodes. The system was implemented on a Denning mobile robot, and tested in our laboratory building at Georgia Tech.

Reference-contexts: Each motor behavior (or schema) is associated with a perceptual schema capable of providing the stimulus required for that particular behavior. This action-oriented perception is the basis for reactive navigation [11]. Each reactive behavior generates a response vector in a manner analogous to the potential fields method <ref> [9] </ref>. The schemas can operate asynchronously, transmitting their results to a process (move-robot) which sums and normalizes these inputs and transmits them to the low-level control system for execution (Figure 2). A homeostatic control system [12] (tested only in simulation to date) is interwoven with the motor and perceptual schemas. <p> Nonetheless a range of reactive strategies have been developed to circumvent to some degree these inherent low-level problems. These partial solutions include the use of noise as a form of "reactive grease" <ref> [9] </ref>, an avoid-past behavior [24], and various methods of learning and adaptation including the use of the notion of momentum [25], case-based reasoning [43] and genetic algorithms [44]. Assemblages of behaviors are formed by combining primitive behaviors in meaningful ways. <p> This robot was controlled remotely either via a wire tether or a radio link from a Digital Vax computer. HARV was the testbed upon which the first implementations of motor schemas were investigated <ref> [9, 6] </ref>.

A homeostatic control system <ref> [12] </ref> (tested only in simulation to date) is interwoven with the motor and perceptual schemas. Internal sensors, such as fuel level and temperature transducers, provide information over a broadcast network which is monitored by behaviors containing suitable receptors. <p> Action-oriented perception also has a strong psychological basis, motivated largely by Gibson's theory of affordances [30]. The homeostatic control system was developed using models of the mammalian endocrine system as inspiration <ref> [12] </ref>. These models provide the basis for broadcast communication, the partition of negative feedback control into transmitter and receptor schemas, and the provision for modulation of an ongoing behavioral process by internal sensing. 3 Related Robot Architectures Deliberative hierarchical robotic architectures such as NASREM [1] appeared in the early 1980s.

Several of these robotic systems are described in in more detail in Section 4. Finally, one of the major strengths of AuRA results from the power of wedding two distinct AI paradigms: deliberation and reactivity. <p> If cooperation is to exist between these robots, it must be implemented without communication, since they are not equipped with communication devices. Previous work at Georgia Tech has shown that cooperation may arise in multiagent foraging teams even without communication <ref> [13] </ref>. A key aspect of cooperation without communication in the previous work involves recognition of fellow team members in order to spread the team apart during the wander phase. This allows more efficient search of the environment for interesting items like trash.

The inherent short-sightedness of a purely reactive approach is one motivation for integrating deliberation and reactive control in AuRA.

Reference-contexts: Dempster-Shafer statistical methods provide the basis for evidential reasoning. * The original rule-based Plan Sequencer has been replaced with a temporal sequencer <ref> [16] </ref> that traverses a finite state acceptor (FSA) expression of a plan [37].

Transitions are made from one state to another when significant perceptual events trigger them. <p> A novel perceptual schema used visual cues to estimate the location of the poles based on the inherent perspective in the image.

Reference-contexts: In early implementations of AuRA learning arose only from short-term memory of spatial information used for dynamic replanning.

Reference-contexts: First, the Plan Sequencer attempts to reroute the robot based on information that has been obtained during navigation and stored in short-term memory. Original implementations used sonar maps produced using the Elfes-Moravec algorithms for spatial world modeling <ref> [27] </ref>. If for some reason this proves to be unsatisfactory (e.g., the route is completely blocked within this local context), the Spatial Reasoner is reinvoked. It attempts to regenerate a new global route that bypasses the affected region entirely.

Reference-contexts: Finally, one of the major strengths of AuRA results from the power of wedding two distinct AI paradigms: deliberation and reactivity. The advantages of this strategy have been demonstrated in several other hybrid architectures that have subsequently appeared, most notably Gat's Atlantis architecture <ref> [28] </ref>, a three layered system. 2 Biological Connections AuRA has, from its inception, been influenced by a wide range of ethological, neuroscientific, and psychological studies. The most profound influence has been that of schema theory [2]. <p> AuRA, as described in this paper, first appeared in 1986-87 [4, 6].

Reference-contexts: The justification for hybridization of reactive and deliberative control can be found in studies by psychologists such as Norman and Shallice [42] and Neisser [41]. Action-oriented perception also has a strong psychological basis, motivated largely by Gibson's theory of affordances <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Within AuRA, schemas are employed at the reactive control level, and are encoded using an analog of the potential fields method <ref> [32] </ref>. Each motor schema receives sensory data from an associated perceptual schema and generates its reaction to the stimulus in the form of a vector.

Reference-contexts: The most profound influence has been that of schema theory [2]. Schema theory is a theory of intelligence which represents motor and perceptual control at a level of abstraction higher than that of neural networks. Developed by Arbib [2], formalized by Lyons <ref> [33] </ref>, and operationalized by Arkin [5], schema theory develops sensorimotor coordination as a series of active concurrent processes, each independently striving to achieve an agent's goals. Within AuRA, schemas are employed at the reactive control level, and are encoded using an analog of the potential fields method [32].
