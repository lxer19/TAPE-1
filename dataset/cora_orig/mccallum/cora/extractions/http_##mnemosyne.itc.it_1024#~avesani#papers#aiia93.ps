Abstract: Dimensions of complexity raised during the definition of a system aimed at supporting the planning of initial attack to forest fires are presented and discussed. The complexity deriving from the highly dynamic and unpredictable domain of forest fire, the one realated to the individuation and integration of planning techniques suitable to this domain, the complexity of addressing the problem of taking into account the role of the user to be supported by the system and finally the complexity of an architecture able to integrate different subsystems. In particular we focus on the severe constraints to the definition of a planning approach posed by the fire fighting domain, constraints which cannot be satisfied completely by any of the current planning paradigms. We propose an approach based on the integratation of skeletal planning and case based reasoning techniques with constraint reasoning. More specifically temporal constraints are used in two steps of the planning process: plan fitting and adaptation, and resource scheduling. Work on the development of the system software architecture with a OOD methodology is in progress.

Reference-contexts: We have completed a first cycle of knowledge acquisition interviews and we have defined a complete functional architecture. We are addressing now the software architecture of the system. This architecture will be developed using the design methodology proposed by G. Booch <ref> [Booch 91] </ref> and with the aid of a software tools OSD, that implements faithfully the Booch methodology.

Reference-contexts: Main limitations for applying a constructive planning approach to the fire fighting domain rest on the inadequacy of the action representation and on the assumption that the world and the consequences of actions may be completely predicted (see for instance [Wilkins 84]). Skeletal planning <ref> [Friedland and Iwasaki 85] </ref> and Case Based planning [Hammond 89] assigne a foundamental role to the past experience in formulating new plans and in debuggigng old ones. In both cases plans are fetched from the memory, but they radically differ in the meaning given to a stored plan.

Reference-contexts: First of all, we must mention the integration of different reasoning paradigms, that is an extensively studied problem in AI [Skinner and Luger 92] [Wilkins and Desimone 92] [Kambhampati et al 91] <ref> [Hayes-Roth 85] </ref>. Second, the planning system is only a component of a bigger integrated system.

Reference-contexts: The main conclusions at this point come directly from matching the user requirements with the technical alternatives. The control of the system should be assigned to the user, that will be supported by an explicit representation of his task structure implemented into the dialogue controller <ref> [Johnson et al. 92] </ref>. Skeletal planning should assist the strategical level of the decision process while CBR should raise assumptions at the tactical level. Constraint reasoning, strictly coupled with CBR will refine the proposed tactic and will enable quantitative temporal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: This yields another dimension of complexity: the architectural problems. The necessity to couple strictly the user interaction with the functionalities of the planner subsystem sets complex architectural problems. First of all, we must mention the integration of different reasoning paradigms, that is an extensively studied problem in AI <ref> [Skinner and Luger 92] </ref> [Wilkins and Desimone 92] [Kambhampati et al 91] [Hayes-Roth 85].
