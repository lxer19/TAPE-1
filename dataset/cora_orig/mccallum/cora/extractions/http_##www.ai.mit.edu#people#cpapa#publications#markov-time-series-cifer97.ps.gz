Abstract: There has been a surge in interest in the analysis and prediction of high frequency time series in recent years. We consider the problem of predicting the direction of change in tick data of the Swiss franc/U.S. dollar exchange rate. To accomplish this, we show that a Markov model can find regularities in certain local regions of the data and can be used to predict the direction of the next tick. Predictability seems to decrease in more recent years. With transaction costs, the model is unlikely to be profitable.

Reference-contexts: It is also important to note that several researchers have used a similar model to our Markov chain model, but at a much coarser resolution. In particular, Engel and Hamilton [2] and Engel <ref> [1] </ref> use a Markov switching model to model exchange rates for quarterly data. Engel concludes that the Markov switching model is more effective at predicting the direction of change, rather than the actual value, of exchange rates.

Reference-contexts: Significance is measured separately for buy and 5 sell predictions. The tests take into account the actual distribution of increases and decreases for each prediction period; baseline guessing accuracy may differ from 50%. This test is related to the Henriksson-Merton test <ref> [3] </ref>, but this connection has not been fully explored yet.

Reference-contexts: Since we are using a second order Markov model, the Markov chain is indexed by the three variables i, j, and k, corresponding to times t 2, t 1, and t, respectively. While this model is rather simple, LeBaron <ref> [4] </ref> shows, for a one year portion of this data set, that there are 3 indeed significant first-order negative autocorrelations. Our system should be able to model these, and other more complex, patterns. <p> As stated above, the percentage threshold above which the system creates a rule is varied from 50% to 70%. As a benchmark, the Markov-based model is compared with one that uses a simple reversal strategy as in LeBaron <ref> [4] </ref>. For the next tick, t, this strategy gives a buy signal when r t1 &lt; 0 and a sell signal when r t1 &gt; 0. For a closer comparison of these two strategies, the reversal strategy makes a prediction only when the Markov system makes a prediction.

Reference-contexts: This system takes as input past measurements for this exchange rate, volatility and trend measures derived exclusively from the exchange rate series, and the current and past exchange rates for other currencies. Mozer <ref> [5] </ref> uses a recurrent neural network that takes tick data and predicts the exchange rate 1, 15, and 60 minutes in the future. It is also important to note that several researchers have used a similar model to our Markov chain model, but at a much coarser resolution.

Reference-contexts: introduction to Markov chains; for an excellent introduction to hidden Markov models see Rabiner and Juang <ref> [6] </ref>. The Markov chain is an integer time process composed of a set of N states and N 2 transition probabilities. We denote the states by Q = fq i g N i=1 and let Q (t) denote the state of the system at time t.

Reference-contexts: Zhang [9] uses a multi-layer perceptron to forecast Swiss franc/U.S. dollar exchange rates based on several inputs from up to 180 minutes prior to the prediction time. These inputs are used to predict the exchange rate 30 minutes in the future. Weigend, Huberman, and Rumelhart <ref> [8] </ref> predict the Tuesday U.S. dollar/Deutsch mark rate using a feedforward neural network over daily data. This system takes as input past measurements for this exchange rate, volatility and trend measures derived exclusively from the exchange rate series, and the current and past exchange rates for other currencies.

Reference-contexts: We nevertheless present a brief overview of several related systems. Of particular relevance to this paper are those systems that attempt predictions at the level of ticks. Zhang <ref> [9] </ref> uses a multi-layer perceptron to forecast Swiss franc/U.S. dollar exchange rates based on several inputs from up to 180 minutes prior to the prediction time. These inputs are used to predict the exchange rate 30 minutes in the future.
