Title: ANALYSIS OF HOARE'S FIND ALGORITHM WITH MEDIAN-OF-THREE PARTITION  
Author: PETER KIRSCHENHOFER CONRADO MART INEZ AND HELMUT PRODINGER 
Date: March 24, 1995  
Abstract: Hoare's Find algorithm can be used to select the jth element out of a file of n elements. It bears a remarkable similarity to Quicksort; in each pass of the algorithm, a pivot element is used to split the file into two subfiles, and recursively, the algorithm proceeds with the subfile that contains the sought element. As in Quicksort, different strategies for selecting the pivot are reasonable. In this paper, we consider the Median-of-three version, where the pivot element is chosen as the median of a random sample of three elements. We give explicit formul for both the average number of passes and comparisons, when any relative ordering of the n elements in the file is equally likely.

Reference-contexts: Both, the original and this Median-of-three version are very well understood, see [7] and [8]. The Median-of-three strategy can also be used in the context of Hoare's Find algorithm. The basic algorithm was analyzed in [6], and an attempt to analyze the Median-of-three version appeared in <ref> [1] </ref>; in this paper, we give a satisfactory analysis of it (some more comments on that appear in the concluding section). <p> KIRSCHENHOFER, C. MART INEZ, AND H. PRODINGER The leading coefficients (of the order N), if we search for the median, are this time 11 2 = 5:5 and 4 (1 + log 2) = 6:772588722, so that the savings are roughly 19%. 4. The Australian Version In the paper <ref> [1] </ref>, the authors make the assumption that each partitioning phase costs n 3 comparisons, as opposed to the assumption of n 1 comparisons to partition a file of size n in the previous section. <p> Note that in this way we detected some flaws in the first attempt of an analysis of the refined version of Hoare's Find algorithm in <ref> [1] </ref>, and give the corresponding satisfactory answers.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Hoare's Find algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> uses the idea of Quicksort [4] in order to select the jth largest element out of a file of n elements. In each partitioning phase, a certain element will be brought into its correct position, left to it being only smaller, right to it only larger elements.

Reference-contexts: KIRSCHENHOFER, C. MART INEZ, AND H. PRODINGER with the initial conditions G @G For the reader's convenience, we recall <ref> [5] </ref> that, under certain assumptions on the parameters, the hypergeometric differential equation t (1 t) g 00 (t) + c (1 + a + b)t g 0 (t) ab g (t) = 0 (11) has in a neighbourhood of t = 0 the solution g (t) = c 1 2 F <p> In our instance, the two hyperge ometric functions degenerate to polynomials ("terminating hypergeometric series"), and we get the homogeneous solution G [hom] (t; u) = c 1 (u)(1 2t) + c 2 (u)t 5 1 2t + 7 5 t 3 : (13) Using the variation of parameters method <ref> [5] </ref>, inserting the initial conditions, and resubstituting we find D (z; u) = D 1 (z; u) + u 2 D 1 (uz; u 1 ) + D 2 (z; u); (14) where D 1 (z; u) = (1 z) 2 (1 uz) 2 log 1 z &lt; 6 (1 u)

Reference-contexts: The idea is that then it is more likely that no subfile is degenerate. Both, the original and this Median-of-three version are very well understood, see [7] and [8]. The Median-of-three strategy can also be used in the context of Hoare's Find algorithm. The basic algorithm was analyzed in <ref> [6] </ref>, and an attempt to analyze the Median-of-three version appeared in [1]; in this paper, we give a satisfactory analysis of it (some more comments on that appear in the concluding section).
