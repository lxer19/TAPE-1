Title: AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO BOUNDED CONTROLLABILITY OF LINEAR SYSTEMS  
Author: Eduardo D. Sontag 
Address: New Brunswick, NJ 08903  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics Rutgers University  
Abstract: In this note we present an algebraic approach to the proof that a linear system with matrices (A,B) is null-controllable using bounded inputs iff it is null-controllable (with unbounded inputs) and all eigenvalues of A have nonpositive real parts (continuous time) or magnitude not greater than one (discrete time). We also give the analogous results for the asymptotic case. Finally, we give an interpretation of these results in the context of local nonlinear controllability.

Reference-contexts: This more general statement was proved for continuous time scalar (m=1) systems in [2], which also gives a proof in the (continuous) case with m&gt;1 but with extra assumptions on A. These assumptions were dropped in <ref> [1] </ref> (see also [5]).

Reference-contexts: It can be proved that every matrix can be written as [S,L]+BL, for fixed (A,B) and varying (S,L), if and only if (A,B) is reachable; see <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, L is a submersion at e. By the implicit function theorem, L is open on a ngbd N of e. Pick b&gt;0, and restrict N so that (T,K)N implies ||K||&lt;b.
