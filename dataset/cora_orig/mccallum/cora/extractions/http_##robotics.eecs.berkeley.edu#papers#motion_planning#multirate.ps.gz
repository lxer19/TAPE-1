Reference-contexts: More recently, it has been shown by Monaco and Normand-Cyrot [4] that piecewise constant controls may be used for non-holonomic path planning. The system that we use as our example was originally examined in <ref> [1] </ref>. It has three control inputs and can be shown to be completely controllable. In addition, the system can be transformed into a specific class of nilpotent systems called chained form systems. Using these chained form coordinates, We apply the multi-rate control scheme to the example system. <p> There are two length constants: l 0 is the distance between the front and rear wheels of the truck, and l 1 is the distance between the rear wheels of the truck and the rear wheels of the trailer. The kinematic equations are derived in <ref> [1] </ref>, and are stated here for convenience: 0 B B @ _y _ 0 _ 1 C C C = B B B cos 0 0 l 0 sin ( 1 0 + 1 ) 1 C C A 0 B B @ 0 0 0 C C C u 2 <p> As shown in <ref> [1] </ref>, this system can be put into a special three-input chained form by a change of coordinates and state feedback. We will find it convenient to use this chained form for our path-planning algorithm, since the Lie algebra generated by the transformed input vector fields is nilpotent. <p> We will find it convenient to use this chained form for our path-planning algorithm, since the Lie algebra generated by the transformed input vector fields is nilpotent. We state here the coordinate transformation and the resulting chained form equations. More details on the derivation can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. z 1 = x tan 0 z 3 = l 1 cos 1 cos 0 z 5 = 1 The corresponding input transformation is: v 1 = cos 0 u 1 3 tan 2 0 sin 0 0 cos 4 0 1 u 2 cos ( 1 0 + 1 <p> One method is the multi-rate scheme which we propose in this paper. As a means of comparison, we have also followed the step-by-step sinusoids algorithm presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. This algorithm also plans paths for systems in chained form, and requires one step for each level of a chain. For example, the firetruck system has a three-level chain and so three steps are needed.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that the multi-rate control is most useful for planning short paths which satisfy the nonholo-nomic constraints. If the robot were required to traverse a long distance or avoid obstacles, a holonomic path could first be planned using well-known standard techniques (see for example <ref> [2] </ref>). The main controller could choose a series of points along this path, which could then be connected using feasible paths generated by the multi-rate algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Some early work by Murray and Sastry (see [5]) used sinusoidal inputs at varying frequencies to plan paths for systems in a special chained canonical form. More recently, it has been shown by Monaco and Normand-Cyrot <ref> [4] </ref> that piecewise constant controls may be used for non-holonomic path planning. The system that we use as our example was originally examined in [1]. It has three control inputs and can be shown to be completely controllable. <p> 2 = v 2 _z 3 = v 3 _z 6 = z 4 v 1 From this point on we will consider the system in these coordinates. 3 Multi-Rate Controls The idea of using piecewise constant inputs with different holding times for nonholonomic motion planning was first introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>. Although this multi-rate control can be applied to almost any system, it is especially powerful for systems admitting an exact discretization, since in this case, an exact point-to-point trajectory can be generated.

Reference-contexts: We transform the path-planning problem with constraints on the velocities into the dual control problem with fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom. Some early work by Murray and Sastry (see <ref> [5] </ref>) used sinusoidal inputs at varying frequencies to plan paths for systems in a special chained canonical form. More recently, it has been shown by Monaco and Normand-Cyrot [4] that piecewise constant controls may be used for non-holonomic path planning.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Our interests in this paper are in finding paths for non-holonomic systems. These systems are characterized by having nonintegrable constraints on the state velocities which do not restrict the reachable configuration space. There is a classical result from nonlinear control theory <ref> [6] </ref> which can be used to prove that such systems are completely controllable, implying that a feasible path exists between any two points in free space. This result, however, does not have a constructive proof.
