Abstract: A General Result on the Stabilization of Linear Systems Using Bounded Controls 1 ABSTRACT We present two constructions of controllers that globally stabilize linear systems subject to control saturation. We allow essentially arbitrary saturation functions. The only conditions imposed on the system are the obvious necessary ones, namely that no eigenvalues of the uncontrolled system have positive real part and that the standard stabilizability rank condition hold. One of the constructions is in terms of a "neural-network type" one-hidden layer architecture, while the other one is in terms of cascades of linear maps and saturations.

Reference-contexts: These systems cannot be naturally dealt with within the context of standard (algebraic) linear control theory, but are ubiquitous in control applications. To quote the recent textbook <ref> [8] </ref> (page 171): "saturation is probably the most commonly encountered nonlinearity in control engineering." Mathematically, control questions become nontrivial, as only control values bounded by C are allowed into the underlying linear system. We will present results on global stabilization, concentrating on several explicit architectures for controllers.

Reference-contexts: Assume without loss of generality that the first column b 1 of B is nonzero and consider the Kalman controllability decomposition of the system 1 : _x = Ax + b 1 u (see <ref> [11] </ref>, Lemma 3.3.3). We conclude that, after a change of coordinates y = T 1 x, 1 has the form _y 1 = A 1 y 1 + A 2 y 2 + b 1 u ; where (A 1 ; b 1 ) is a controllable pair. <p> Then y = T 1 x, with T = R (A; b)R ( ~ A; ~ b) 1 , is the desired transformation, where R (A; b) denotes the controllability matrix of (A; b). See Section 3.3 of <ref> [11] </ref>.) 18 To get a stabilizing feedback of Type F , we will choose positive constants 1 ; 2 ; ; s1 and let s1 y s2 + + 1 1 ( 1 2 s1 ! To get a Type G stabilizing feedback we choose positive numbers 1 ; 2 ; <p> Using the standard "backstepping" (or "adding an integrator") con struction (see, e.g., Lemma 4.8.3 in <ref> [11] </ref>), we conclude that (8.1) is stabilizable. However, in order to build a stabilizer for (8.1) using backstepping, we would first have to find a Lyapunov function for (8.2). Since this is usually hard to do, it is desirable to be able to build a stabilizer without using Lyapunov functions.

Reference-contexts: In the terminology of current "artificial neural networks" technology, our results allow the implementation of feedback controllers using very general types of activation (neuron characteristic) functions. For a detailed application of the results given in this paper to a model aircraft control example, see <ref> [13] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. Our main result on state feedback is stated in Section 2 and proved in Section 4, using two technical lemmas proved in Section 3.
