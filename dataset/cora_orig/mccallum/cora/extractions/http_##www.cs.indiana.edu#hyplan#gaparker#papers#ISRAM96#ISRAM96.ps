Abstract: Robotics control problems, such as gait coordination, require sequential solutions where a series of actions is continually repeated. Genetic Algorithms that do parameter optimization have not been widely applied to these cyclic sequential decision problems; although some form of evolutionary computation would be well suited for the adaptability required. In this paper we introduce Cyclic Genetic Algorithms, which were developed precisely for this purpose. The specific problem addressed, adaptive gait development for hexapod robots, was the impetus for this new kind of evolutionary computation, but it can be applied to other robotics domains.

In addition, we wanted it to be a quickly converging algorithm suitable for anytime learning <ref> [5] </ref>. Cyclic Genetic Algorithms were developed with four variations that were tested and found capable of producing reasonable gaits. One variation produced the optimal tripod gait and was robust enough to adapt to significant changes in the capabilities of the robot model.

Reference-contexts: METHOD The general approach was to develop a model capable of representing all states of the robot and use a cyclic genetic algorithm to train this model to walk forward. The robot used in the formation of our model was the Stiquito II; developed by Mills <ref> [6] </ref> as an alternative to the larger, more complex and expensive norm in six legged robots. It was selected due to its potential for expanded research and its elementary locomotion; which makes it a perfect platform for learning to walk using low-level primitives.

Reference-contexts: Fields for each leg were included to store the legs capabilities and current position. CYCLIC GENETIC ALGORITHMS Some alterations to the general theme for Hollands genetic algorithms <ref> [7] </ref> were required to develop locomotion control. The time factor necessitated some way to represent behavior over time.
