Abstract: The IETF Mobile IPv4 protocol described in RFC 2002 allows arbitrary unmodified IPv4 nodes to transparently communicate with mobile nodes even as those nodes move and change their point of attachment to the Internet between different IP subnets. This document describes the CMU Monarch Project's implementation of the Mobile IPv4 protocol.

Reference-contexts: The Agent Discovery protocol operates as a compatible extension of the existing ICMP Router Discovery protocol <ref> [1] </ref>. When moving to a new location, a mobile node must register with its home agent so that the home agent always knows the mobile node's current care-of address.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 1.1, router R4 is serving as the foreign agent for M. Optionally, instead, if a mobile node can acquire a temporary IP address within the local foreign subnet, for example through DHCP <ref> [2] </ref>, the mobile node may use this temporary address as its care-of address; packets forwarded to the mobile node are sent to this temporary address, while the mobile node continues to use its home address for all other functions.

Reference-contexts: Mobile IP software which runs on Windows platforms can be purchased from FTP Software (and probably other companies). * This version of CMU Monarch Mobile IPv4 does not support Route Optimization <ref> [3] </ref>. * This version of CMU Monarch Mobile IPv4 does not support reverse tunneling. * We don't yet support config files with multiple keys for the same node with different SPI's.

Reference-contexts: The path followed by a packet while it is encapsulated is known as a tunnel, and this use of encapsulation is known as tunneling. The default encapsulation protocol used by home agents to tunnel packets, known as IP in IP encapsulation <ref> [4] </ref>, is illustrated in Figure 1.2. With this protocol, a new IP header (shaded) is wrapped around the existing packet.

Reference-contexts: The Mobile IPv4 protocol is a product of its IP Routing for Wireless/Mobile Hosts (Mobile IP) Working Group <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> If the mobile node is not on its home network, these ARP packets can confuse the local nodes, and thus the Mobile IP protocol specifies that no ARP packets be sent by a mobile node while away from home <ref> [5] </ref>. If mobiled is started with the -b flag before the first call to ifconfig, it will prevent the transmission of these initial ARPs. The -b flag implies the -d flag. To start mobiled correctly, the following example lines could be added to /etc/netstart.
Reference: [6] <author> Charles Perkins. </author> <title> Minimal encapsulation within IP. Internet Request For Comments RFC 2004, </title> <month> October </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: An alternative tunneling protocol, known as minimal encapsulation, is also defined within the basic Mobile IP protocol, and adds only 8 or 12 bytes to each packet <ref> [6] </ref>. This protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.3. With minimal encapsulation, a small tunneling header (shaded) is inserted in the packet after the existing IP header, before any existing transport level header such as TCP or UDP.

Plummer. </author> <title> An Ethernet address resolution protocol: Or converting network protocol addresses to 48.bit Ethernet addresses for transmission on Ethernet hardware. Internet Request For Comments RFC 826, </title> <month> November </month> <year> 1982. </year>
Reference-contexts: The probable cause of such failures is that ARP is shut off on your machine. To comply with RFC 2002, while the mobile node is away from its home network, mobiled turns off the machine's ability to use the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) <ref> [7] </ref> to find the link-layer address of neighboring machines. This effectively prevents communication with any machines once the mobiled dies. To enable the mobile node to communicate with other machines again, ether restart mobiled or turn ARP back on manually.

Reference-contexts: Although more efficient than IP in IP encapsulation, the minimal encapsulation protocol cannot be used with IP packets that have been fragmented <ref> [8] </ref>, since the tunneling header does not provide a means to indicate that the original packet was a fragment. 4 5 Chapter 2 CMU Monarch Mobile IPv4 Implementation 2.1 Overview The CMU Monarch Mobile IPv4 implementation is split into user-level code and kernel-level code.

Reference-contexts: The particular context used for any authentication is indicated by a Security Parameter Index (or SPI) that is part of the authentication. The default authentication algorithm and mode in Mobile IP currently uses the MD5 secure one-way hash function <ref> [9] </ref>. A keyed MD5 algorithm is used, based on a secret key shared between a mobile node and its home agent, such that the authentication value can only be correctly computed by a node knowing the secret key.

Reference-contexts: Periodic functions, such as handling agent advertisements, and control functions, such as network interface management and handling Registration Requests and Replies, are implemented in user-level processes that typically run as background daemons. The user-level processes communicate with the kernel-level functions via routing socket messages <ref> [10] </ref>, as explained in Section 5.1. 2.2 Limitations * This version of CMU Monarch Mobile IPv4 has been tested on Intel 486 and Pentium platforms running the following platforms. <p> That said, lets move on: : : 5.1 Routing Socket Messages All communication between the user-level mobility agents and the Mobile IP kernel functions is by way of messages sent on a routing socket <ref> [10] </ref>. (A major part of the effort required to port Monarch Mobile IPv4 to a non-4.4BSD-derived OS would be replacing the routing socket message passing mechanism with ioctl () calls.
