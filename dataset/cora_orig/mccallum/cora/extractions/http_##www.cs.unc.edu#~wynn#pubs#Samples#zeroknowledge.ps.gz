Title: Implementation of a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Identity  
Author: William C. Wynn, 
Date: June 13, 1997  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Uuniversity of California, Davis  
Abstract: This paper provides a very brief introduction to the concept of zero-knowledge proofs of identity and presents the implementation of a zero-knowledge protocol in a "telnet-like" application. The implementation is based upon the Feige-Fiat-Shamir Proof of Identity.
