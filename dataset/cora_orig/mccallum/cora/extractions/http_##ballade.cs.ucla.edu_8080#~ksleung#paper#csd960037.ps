Abstract: In this paper, we present two optimal algorithms for solving the Minimum Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence (MRSA) Problem. The first algorithm is a recursive branch-and-bound variant of the RSA heuristic by Rao et al. [14]. The second algorithm uses dynamic programming to avoid solving the same subproblem more than once. In particular, we show that each subproblem in the recursion can be completely characterized by a triple (P; K; C), which can be defined and solved recursively. We use hashing-based dynamic programming to limit the total number of triples (subproblems) solved, and such technique was proven to be highly effective. Furthermore, both algorithms can be generalized to solve the All-Quadrant Minimum Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence Problem. Extensive experimental results show that our dynamic-programming-based algorithm can solve the single-quadrant MRSA problem with 100 terminals optimally in one minute, and the all-quadrant MRSA problem with 240 terminals optimally in one hour. Our algorithms significantly outperform existing exact methods for solving the MRSA problem, which can only handle 20 to 35 nodes in an hour.
