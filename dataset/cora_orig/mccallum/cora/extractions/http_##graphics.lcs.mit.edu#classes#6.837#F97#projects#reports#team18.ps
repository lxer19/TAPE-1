Title: Team  
Author: Cyril Morcrette Richard Rabbat Adam Holt Arthur Shek 
Abstract: We built a high-realism 3D model of the central MIT campus. This scenery provides backdrops for a cute comedy-based animation. We drew on a variety of graphics techniques and commercial tools to form a pipeline from reality-based inputs to model construction to cinematic animation. Starting from 2D architectural CAD plans of building floors, we extruded and then optimized faces for actual structural detail. We carried out extensive outdoor digital photography of building facades, which after careful correction and touchup, formed textures applied to building models. We used (color) photogrammetry to enhance the roofs. Our final product is a scripted, multi-character animation taking place on our virtual MIT campus one cloudy day...
