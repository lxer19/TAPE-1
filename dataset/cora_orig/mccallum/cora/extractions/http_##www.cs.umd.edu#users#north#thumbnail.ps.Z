Abstract: Image browsers are a vital tool for the access and management of digital image databases in that they provide the user with a means to manually traverse and search images in the database. These image browsers must make a tradeoff between the size in which they display each image and the number of images which they display at once. Some present a single large high resolution image and allow the user to page through the database of images one at a time. Others use a technique called thumbnailing in which images are shrunken down to a smaller size, allowing several to be displayed on screen at once. This paper describes an experiment to discover the optimal thumbnailing strategy in terms of image size vs. image density. The results suggested that the ideal balance lies in the direction of presenting many small images at once. However, this strategy can be taken too far, causing performance to drop. Guidelines for image browser design are discussed, as well as the effectiveness of such an experiment for evaluating individual designs.

Reference-contexts: Images that are larger than the hardwares display capability are either clipped or the browser provides some primitive means for the user to scroll around the larger image, displaying only a fraction of the total image at one time <ref> (as discussed in Plaisant, Carr and Shneiderman, 94) </ref>. An example of this is the VPIC program which is primarily designed to browse databases of pictures stored in several popular image formats. VPIC is a DOS based program utilizing text-based menu selection for the various actions supported by the program.
