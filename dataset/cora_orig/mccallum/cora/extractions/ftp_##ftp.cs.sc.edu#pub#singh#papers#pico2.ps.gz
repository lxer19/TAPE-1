Title: An Architecture and Communication Protocol for Picocellular Networks

Abstract: In this paper we present an architecture for a picocellular network and a novel communication protocol for mobile users in such networks. The cell size in these networks is very small typically of the order of a room in a building, resulting in an environment where the movement between cells is very rapid. This makes the problems of tracking and maintaining communication between mobile users non-trivial. To better track these mobile users we propose an architecture consisting of a two level hierarchy of fixed nodes. This architecture combined with the idea of groups ensures that seamless communication is maintained between mobile users. Groups are special collections of picocells and represent regions where a mobile user is likely to be located in the near future. Thus, messages addressed to this mobile user are multicast to all the picocells

Reference-contexts: This type of computing environment is referred to as mobile computing. The mobility of the nodes and the small size (in terms of storage space) of the hand-held devices make traditional solutions to network problems such as addressing, routing and flow-control inapplicable. Recently several authors (see for instance <ref> [1, 7, 9] </ref>) have developed solutions to some of these problems for microcellular or intra-campus networks. A microcellular network is one where a geographical area (such as a university campus) is divided into regions called `microcells'. <p> associated with microcellular networks have been quite extensively studied in the literature. [7] present a set of IP-based protocols to provide continuous network access to mobile hosts in a microcellular environment. [6] proposes a very flexible solution to the problem of addressing mobile users the Virtual Internet Protocol or VIP. <ref> [1] </ref> discusses the problem of multicasting in similar environments. [4] introduced the idea of a cellular 2 packet switch to efficiently handle the problem of hand-off in cellular communications. <p> Let us assume that an MH originally set up connections when it was in the cell of MSS 1 . It now moves out of this cell and into MSS 2 ,MSS 3 ,MSS 4 etc. In most discussions in the literature, <ref> [1] </ref>, MSS 1 continues to serve as the connection end-point for all open connections and continues to forward packets to the current MSS of the MH. Only after the MH moves "far away" does the connection end-point get changed to the current MSS.

Reference-contexts: in the literature. [7] present a set of IP-based protocols to provide continuous network access to mobile hosts in a microcellular environment. [6] proposes a very flexible solution to the problem of addressing mobile users the Virtual Internet Protocol or VIP. [1] discusses the problem of multicasting in similar environments. <ref> [4] </ref> introduced the idea of a cellular 2 packet switch to efficiently handle the problem of hand-off in cellular communications. <p> Let the bandwidth 7 available to each user be 2Mbps (see <ref> [4] </ref>), assume the average packet length is 1KByte and T = 100 msec (in the literature a value of 1 sec is used which, we believe, is too long). Thus we obtain N 2 = 22 packets and N 1 = 10 packets.

Reference-contexts: In our original discussion of the group-based communication protocol, (section 3) this fraction is 1 since all packets are buffered 1 Recall that the channel allocation policy followed in most cellular systems is TDMA. For example, <ref> [5] </ref> discusses a TDMA scheme where the slots are 8 bytes long. Thus, it will take a long time for a large packet to be completly delivered to the MH and the MH can potentially move out of the cell in the middle of transmission.

We assume that every MH has a globally unique address (such as a Virtual IP address as in <ref> [6] </ref>) regardless of where it is in the network. This is necessary because, as pointed out in [7], if the address of an MH depends upon its location then higher-level software will have to deal with address changes which is very inefficient.
