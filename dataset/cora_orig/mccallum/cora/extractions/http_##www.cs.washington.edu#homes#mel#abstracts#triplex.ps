Abstract: been thoroughly studied, and much is known about their favorable and unfavorable properties. For example, oblivious routers are simple and deliver messages in-order, but they have lower throughput when the network is congested. Adaptive routers are more complex, can deliver messages out-of-order, but have better throughput characteristics. No one router is perfect. This paper investigates the idea of routing with multiple kinds of traffic simultaneously. We call such routers multi-class routers. The approach is not to group three independent routers together on a chip, but rather to create an integrated multi-class router capable of simultaneously processing messages for each of the classes supported. Clearly, deadlock and livelock are critical issues with multiple classes, since traffic from one class must not cause deadlock in another. Triplex is the first triple class router. It supports oblivious, minimal fully adaptive, and non-minimal fully adaptive routing classes for k-ary n-cubes. Alternatives can be chosen at boot-time, or per message. Triplex is suitable for wormhole or packet flow control and is shown to be deadlock-free and livelock-free. One figure of merit for evaluating multi-class routers is the performance penalty over each of the best single class routers. Triplex is competitive with the best oblivious and the best minimal fully adaptive router, but on this metric is inferior to the best non-minimal fully adaptive router. An open question posed by this research is whether there exists a triple class router that is competitive for all three classes of routing.

Reference-contexts: It also requires a message to carry additional routing information. Fixed priorities are expensive to compare, since they must be large enough to be unique. The fourth alternative is to use a probabilistic scheme, like the Chaos router [KS94] or Tera computer router <ref> [ACK + 90] </ref>, which guarantees a message always has a chance of taking a minimal route. This is simple to implement but results in a probabilistically livelock-free algorithm. Nevertheless, this is sufficient in practice. Unlike the Chaos or Tera computer router, the Triplex algorithm is never forced to deroute.

Reference-contexts: Instead it uses 10 buffers, in addition to a central queue with 5 buffers, for a total of 15 buffers per node. The node latencies to make a routing and selection decision are three cycles for the oblivious and four cycles for the more complex adaptive algorithms <ref> [BFSar] </ref>. Although the adaptive algorithms appear quite complex to describe, the additional calculations required beyond that of the oblivious router are actually easy to compute. See [Ful97] for more details. The buffers are one word 11 long for wormhole routing, while for packet routing, buffers are 20 words long.

Reference-contexts: This method suffers from high contention in large congested networks, and wastes bandwidth on padding required for short messages when the network diameter is large. but achieves adaptivity and fault tolerance without the use of virtual channels. Even fewer routers offer several classes of routing. The Planar-adaptive router <ref> [CK92] </ref> is a minimal partially adaptive routing algorithm that sacrifices algorithm adaptivity to reduce the crossbar complexity required by fully adaptive algorithms. The algorithm restricts routing to two dimensions (a plane) at a time. The highest dimension in one plane is the lowest dimension in the next plane.

The change in the dominant communication cost highlights the need to understand the performance implications of fundamental network issues such as routing algorithms, flow control, and router implementation. Besides advocating multi-class routing, we present Triplex, the first triple class routing algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The first, not so interesting alternative, is to use the minimal adaptive version of the algorithm. The second method is to use a counting scheme which allows each message a maximum number of deroutes, after which the algorithm reverts to an alternative kind of routing like oblivious <ref> [DA93] </ref> or by following an Euler path [Smi81]. These schemes require a message to carry and update additional routing information that records the number of misroutes experienced. The third scheme is similar, but assigns a fixed priority or time-stamp [Nga89] to each message.

Reference-contexts: The choice of class may be specified at system boot-time, by application, or individually by message. Dynamic class selection may be useful when compile time information is available <ref> [Fel93] </ref>, enabling the system to select the best class for the expected traffic. Individual selection is useful, for example, when some messages require in-order delivery, while other messages prefer the increased flexibility of adaptive routing. <p> The cost may be reasonable, since routing possibilities can be computed before the selection bits arrive. Individual class selection might be useful when in-order delivery is required for some messages, the flexibility of adaptive routing is needed by others, or when compile time information is available <ref> [Fel93] </ref> and a particular kind of routing is preferred for the expected traffic. 6 Comparisons Performance of the Triplex algorithm is explored by simulation.

Reference-contexts: The last is a non-minimal fully adaptive router which prefers any minimal path, but occasionally deroutes a message in the presence of severe congestion. 6.1 Router Description The following briefly describes the high level design and operation of the routers. More details can be found in <ref> [Ful97] </ref>. Each router has an injection buffer, a delivery buffer, and an input and an output buffer for each virtual channel in each dimension in each direction. <p> Although the adaptive algorithms appear quite complex to describe, the additional calculations required beyond that of the oblivious router are actually easy to compute. See <ref> [Ful97] </ref> for more details. The buffers are one word 11 long for wormhole routing, while for packet routing, buffers are 20 words long. Besides increasing throughput, packet routing also enables the com parison of Triplex with a scalable non-minimal fully adaptive algorithm. <p> Results show the Triplex algorithm performs well for the oblivious and minimal adaptive modes, but not as well as expected in the non-minimal mode. Representative wormhole results are presented here. Complete results for packet and wormhole routing are found in <ref> [Ful97] </ref>. 6.3.1 Wormhole Results Wormhole results using short messages are presented first. At very low loads where no congestion is present, all the routers achieve the same throughput. The expected latency depends on the minimal latency of a message through the network.

Reference-contexts: This creates cycles in the buffer dependencies. Thus, there is no acyclic ordering of the restricted buffers as in dimension order routing or Duato. Deadlock is avoided by providing an escape route <ref> [Gun81] </ref> for every message. The idea of the deadlock-freedom proof follows. Details can be found in the Appendix. A message always maintains a deadlock-free path in its lowest dimension that needs correcting.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, this paper also presents the multi-class Triplex router. Triplex provides oblivious, minimal fully adaptive, and non-minimal fully adaptive routing for both wormhole or packet-switched flow control, including virtual cut-through <ref> [KK79] </ref> and store-and-forward techniques.

Although the algorithm is non-minimal, no message is forced to take a non-minimal route. <p> Hot Spot 1 Oblivious Oblivious Triplex Duato Minimal Triplex Triplex 0.0 0.2 0.4 Normalized Applied Load 0 1000 Latency (cycles) Hot Spot 1 Oblivious Oblivious Triplex Duato Minimal Triplex Triplex for 400-word and 40-word messages. 7 Related Work A large number of k-ary n-cube wormhole routing algorithms have been developed <ref> [DS87, KP95, LH91, Dua93, Dua95, GPBS94, GN94, LC94, SJ96] </ref>. Each balances algorithm flexibility against resource requirements and router complexity. All offer single class routing. Unlike Triplex, none of the algorithms provide oblivious, minimally fully adaptive, and non-minimal fully adaptive routing. Only a few routers provide in-order message delivery. <p> Unlike the T3E, Triplex supports wormhole and non-minimal routing. Triplex uses a technique of Schweibert and Jayasimha <ref> [SJ96] </ref> that allows cyclic depen dencies in the channels. This yields extra adaptivity since no set of virtual channels is restricted to messages taking oblivious (acyclic) routes. 8 Conclusions The concept of a multi-class router has been promoted to overcome the fact that no single routing class is perfect.

Reference-contexts: The second method is to use a counting scheme which allows each message a maximum number of deroutes, after which the algorithm reverts to an alternative kind of routing like oblivious [DA93] or by following an Euler path <ref> [Smi81] </ref>. These schemes require a message to carry and update additional routing information that records the number of misroutes experienced. The third scheme is similar, but assigns a fixed priority or time-stamp [Nga89] to each message. It also requires a message to carry additional routing information.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm restricts routing to two dimensions (a plane) at a time. The highest dimension in one plane is the lowest dimension in the next plane. By tagging messages and sending them on a dimension order path, messages can also be delivered in-order. The T3E router <ref> [ST96] </ref> is a minimal fully-adaptive (in theory, not implementation) packet routing algorithm for the torus. The router uses the technique of Duato that provides two virtual channels for oblivious routes and a third virtual channel for adaptivity. Using packet-switching simplifies the routing and flow control requirements of using Duato's technique.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, the large software overhead and network interface costs have dominated communication time and overshadowed network performance. Recent research, however, has reduced these times <ref> [vEDCGS92, Dal90, BLA + 94, MBES94, BJM + 96] </ref>, resulting in experimental systems with network latency accounting for over 50% of total communication time, even when no contention occurs [CKP + 93].

Reference-contexts: If the oblivious router always provided the best performance, the choice of routing classes would be easy. If this performance is inadequate, a fully adaptive router provides superior results, but sacrifices simplicity and in-order message delivery. Without in-order delivery, techniques for providing efficient, low cost synchronization <ref> [WSC + 95] </ref>, checkpointing [LNP91], and sequential memory consistency fail, serialization protocols [LHH91] require more messages, and messages separated by a barrier cannot be pipelined in the network. Furthermore, providing in-order message delivery outside of the network requires special hardware, otherwise a substantial latency penalty is incurred.
