Reference: [1] <author> M. Abramowitz and I. </author> <title> Stegun, Handbook of mathematical functions, </title> <publisher> Dover, </publisher> <year> 1965. </year>
Reference-contexts: also expressions in terms of elementary functions for special parameter values, cf. the formulas discussed below under contig and several others like 2 F 1 (a=2; a=2; 1=2; z) = ( 1 + z z) a +( 1 + z z) a The formulas are taken from Abramowitz & Stegun <ref> [1, Ch.15] </ref>. Discussion. For z := sinh 2 t the right hand side of (10.4.1) simplifies to cosh (at). However, Maple will not succeed to arrive at this answer, but leaves the user with a complicated expression.

Askey, </author> <title> How can mathematicians and mathematical historians help each other?, in History and Philosophy of modern mathematics (W. </title> <editor> Aspray and Ph. Kitcher, eds.), </editor> <publisher> University of Minnesota Press, </publisher> <year> 1988, </year> <pages> pp. 201-217. </pages>
Reference-contexts: Askey <ref> [2] </ref>. Maple has a procedure convert/hypergeom which performs this conversion of a sum into hypergeometric form, if possible, and this procedure is sometimes called by the general sum procedure. 10.3.

Reference-contexts: A third item is the Askey tableau of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and its q-analogues, the Askey-Wilson polynomials, cf. Askey & Wilson <ref> [3] </ref>. The big complex of formulas associated with these polynomials should become available in the context of some computer algebra package. Some aspects not discussed in this paper concern the numerical computation and the graphics of special functions.
Reference: [4] <author> W. N. Bailey, </author> <title> Generalized hypergeometric series, </title> <publisher> Cambridge University Press, </publisher> <year> 1935. </year>
Reference-contexts: See Bailey <ref> [4] </ref> and Slater [12]. <p> Another comment is that many summation formulas follow from specialization of parameters in transformation formulas between two p F q 's. If one of the sides becomes explicitly summable then so will be the other side. For instance, Bailey x10 45 <ref> [4, 4.4 (2)] </ref> expresses a well-poised 6 F 5 (1) in terms of a 3 F 2 (1).
Reference: [5] <author> S. B. Ekhad and D. Zeilberger, </author> <title> A 21 st century proof of Dougall's hy-pergeometric sum identity, </title> <type> preprint. </type>
Reference-contexts: Zeilberger has implemented his algorithm in a Maple procedure in a funny way, such that the output is a ready-made paper (cf. for instance Ekhad & Zeilberger <ref> [5] </ref>) proving some explicit summation or recurrence for mula, together with an elementary proof ((10.7.5) and (10.8.2)). 10.9. Further perspectives There are some aspects of special functions not covered in this paper, but still suitable for computer algebra.
Reference: [6] <author> A. </author> <title> Erdelyi e.a., Higher Transcendental Functions, Vol. I, </title> <publisher> McGraw-Hill, </publisher> <year> 1953. </year>
Reference-contexts: Then the various summation formulas for 3 F 2 's yield summation formulas for 6 F 5 , not all of which are covered by args65. simplify/hypergeom/contig21 tries to write a 2 F 1 function in terms of more elementary functions by use of iterated contiguous relations (cf. Erdelyi <ref> [6, 2.8 (28),(38)] </ref>). <p> For instance, 2 F 1 (a; a + 1=2; 2a; z) will not be continuous in a at the nonpositive integers and its explicit evaluation 2 2a1 (1 z) 1=2 (1 + 1 z) 12a given by <ref> [6, 2.8 (6)] </ref> will not be valid for a 2 Z + .

Reference-contexts: There is a rich and still fast developing theory of q-special functions, including many summation theorems, suitable for both the database and the algorithmic approach. See Gasper & Rahman [8] for the basic theory and Gasper <ref> [7] </ref> for some computer algebra experiments in Mathematica. As a second item there are the generalizations to several variables of hy-pergeometric and q-hypergeometric series.

Reference-contexts: Maple's sum procedure is a little dumb in first always trying Gosper's algorithm until this has definitely failed. 10.7. Gosper's algorithm Here we discuss Gosper's algorithm, of which the use in Maple was already shown by example in section 3. The fundamental reference is Gosper <ref> [9] </ref>, see also Hayden & Lamagna [10]. Consider an indefinite summation S (k 2 ) S (k 1 ) := k=k 1 +1 where the summand a k is explicitly given and a k =a k1 is known to be rational in k.

Reference-contexts: Hypergeometric sums are often met in the form of (combinatorial) sums with binomial coefficients, cf. Riordan <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: See Bailey [4] and Slater <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> The formulas are taken from Appendix III in <ref> [12] </ref>. Discussion. It cannot be expected that all explicit summations available in literature are covered by just implementing the formulas from Slater's [12] Appendix. Still there are some omissions which might easily be repaired. <p> The formulas are taken from Appendix III in <ref> [12] </ref>. Discussion. It cannot be expected that all explicit summations available in literature are covered by just implementing the formulas from Slater's [12] Appendix. Still there are some omissions which might easily be repaired. For instance, the left hand side of Dougall's summation formula with d = a=2 will simplify to a 5 F 4 , which is missed by args54.
Reference: [13] <author> D. Zeilberger, </author> <title> A holonomic systems approach to special functions identities, </title> <type> preprint. </type>
Reference-contexts: Zeilberger [14] presents a similar method for obtaining higher order recurrences. Just replace (10.8.3) by S (k) := S (n + 1; k) j=0 where the s j (n) are unknowns. By the theory of holonomic systems, Zeil-berger <ref> [13] </ref> shows that in the generic case there is always a value of l for which the method will succeed. For explicitly given orthogonal polynomials and l = 1 this is a powerful method to get the three-term recurrence relation for the orthogonal polynomials by computer algebra.
