Abstract: Technology is usually the main driving force behind the capabilities of our computer systems and as a result a change in technology can have far reaching consequences for the architecture of future systems. There has been a trend over recent years for processors to be made that are small with low-power consumption, the smart card has to some extent encouraged their development. This paper discusses the variety of Personal Computing Objects that can now be made, some of their uses, and how they may change our view of the traditional computing environment. Modern day distributed computer systems are often referred to in the context of a computing environment. As personal computing is becoming possible with smaller and smaller hand-held devices, there is the potential for the now familiar computing environment to become more tightly integrated into our daily lives, particularly in the context of an office building. Portability is an essential factor providing the opportunity for us to carry a computer of reasonable capability with us for most of the day. The key component to integration is communication: by restricting the local computation requirements of a portable device to a basic level its size and power consumption can be kept to a minimum while the `real' computing power is utilised elsewhere. A portable communication link of this kind is most suited to radio telemetry but infrared communication may also have application. At Olivetti these devices have been called Personal Interactive Computing Objects or PiCOs and this class of device may take many forms. The speed of the communications link limits the application available on any remote machine. Fig 1. illustrates the application limits for many computer systems (using known techniques) at a variety of communication speeds, and also demonstrates the application area of a PiCO device. In the commercial world `Laptop Computers' are becoming particularly prevalent and there are also a growing number of products described as Palmtops and Personal Electronic Diaries. All of these have limited use in practice but if attached to a communications link providing direct access to online databases along with some of the facilities normally available though a workstation, the integrated system would allow computer facilities to be used in most office situations and possibly at home. Such a system has been called `Ubiquitous Computing' by Mark Weiser at Xerox PARC. The Xerox vision is that the computing environment can be extended into the walls and surfaces of an office, and be further enhanced by an array of portable computing technologies including

Reference-contexts: The badge was designed in a case 55x55x7mm with a weight of about 40g. Pulse-width modulated infrared (IR) signals were used for signaling between the badge and sensor <ref> [3] </ref>, mainly because: IR solid-state emitters and detectors can be made very small and very cheaply (unlike ultrasonic transducers). They can be made to operate with a 6m range and the signals are reflected by walls and are not particularly directional when used inside a small room.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the signals will not travel through walls unlike radio signals that can penetrate the partitions found in office buildings. Infrared communication has been used in a number commercial applications ranging from, the remote control of domestic appliances to, data back-up for programmable calculators and personal organisers <ref> [4] </ref>, and at the more novel end of the market IR-based local area networks [5]. Because IR technology has already been exploited commercially, it is inexpensive and readily available for developing new applications such as the `Active Badge'.

An active signaling unit will consume power; therefore the signaling rate is an important design issue.

Reference-contexts: It is clearly de-sireable that all PiCOs should have the ability for two-way communications, however by restricting the communication to one direction in some cases can still result in a useful device but with the advantage its size and power-consumption can be reduced. 1.1 Simplex Devices (transmit-only) The Active Badge <ref> [6] </ref> operates as a beacon, regularly signalling a unique code to a network of sensors distributed around the area to be monitored. Location information is gathered by using a master-processor to poll the sensors through the sensor network.
