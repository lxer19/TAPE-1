Reference-contexts: Section 6 describes graphics-conversion programs while Section 13 describes how to use non-eps graphics in L A T E X. 2 L A T E X Terminology A box is any L A T E X object (characters, graphics, etc.) that is treated as a unit (see <ref> [1, page 103] </ref>). Each box has a reference point on its left side. The box's baseline is a horizontal line which passes through the reference point (see Figure 1). <p> The coverage of the graphicx package in other L A T E X references is sporadic: [2] covers both the graphics and graphicx packages, <ref> [1] </ref> only covers the graphics package and [3] describes neither. 7.1 The includegraphics Command Syntax: "includegraphics [options]-filename where the options are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Since "includegraphics does not end the current paragraph, it can place graphics within text such as or . <p> A "Too Many Unprocessed Floats" error occurs if this logjam of figures exceeds L A T E X's limit of 18 unprocessed floats (see Section 16.4). When L A T E X "tries" to place a figure, it obeys the following rulesAlso see Reference <ref> [1, pg 198] </ref>. 1. A figure can only be placed in the locations specified by its placement options. 2. The figure cannot cause the page to be overfull. 3. The float must be placed on the page where it occurs in the text, or on a later page 9 . <p> See <ref> [1, pages 36,103-5] </ref>. 71 "centering "fbox- "begin-minipage--"mylength "centering "usebox-"mybox "caption-Box Around Figure Graphic and Caption "label-fig:boxed_figure "end-minipage - "end-figure 3. <p> The command "alph-subfigure prints the value of the subfigure counter in lowercase letters, while "roman-subfigure prints the value of the subfigure counter in lowercase Roman numerals.

Since "includegraphics does not end the current paragraph, it can place graphics within text such as or . <p> This aligns the tops of the minipages with the current baseline. If it is instead desired to align the tops of the minipages with the top of the current line of text, replace "vspace-0pt- with "vspace--"baselineskip-. This topic is mentioned in <ref> [3, pages 456-457] </ref>. Graphic Graphic 12 Using Subdirectories When importing a large number of graphics files, it may be desirable to store the graphics files in a subdirectory. <p> L A T E X fonts are described by size and three type style components: shape, series, and family ([1, pages 37,115], <ref> [3, pages 170-71] </ref>). All four of these characteristics can be specified in the "captionfont and "captionlabelfont commands. For example, the commands "begin-figure "renewcommand-"captionfont--"Large "bfseries "sffamily "renewcommand-"captionlabelfont-- "centering "includegraphics [width=2in]-graphic.eps "caption-Test Caption "end-figure produce Figure 26. In this example, the "captionlabelfont command does nothing. <p> To use the [H] option, include a "usepackage-float- command in the preamble and issue the "restylefloat command before the "begin-figure-[H] command is used (See <ref> [3, page 149] </ref>). However, the float package's [H] placement option has the following side-effects 1. When the [H] figure does not fit on a page, the figure is moved to the top of the next page. <p> The command "alph-subfigure prints the value of the subfigure counter in lowercase letters, while "roman-subfigure prints the value of the subfigure counter in lowercase Roman numerals.

Reference-contexts: drawings and add annotations, but currently cannot modify the original eps graphics. 13 Part II The L A T E X Graphics Bundle 7 EPS Graphics Inclusion The best reference for the graphics and graphicx packages is the graphics guide [5] or the L A T E X Graphics Companion <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since both packages have the same capabilities, the examples in this document can also be performed with the graphics package, although the resulting syntax may be more cumbersome and slightly less efficient. For a more-detailed description of the packages, see the graphics bundle documentation <ref> [5] </ref>. For backward-compatibility, the graphics bundle also includes the epsfig package which replaces the original L A T E X 2 " epsfig package. The new epsfig package defines the "epsfbox, "psfig, and "epsfig commands as wrappers which simply call the "includegraphics command. <p> for Unix/Xwindows available from ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/ http://www.cdrom.com/pub/X11/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/ xfig can import EPS drawings and add annotations, but currently cannot modify the original eps graphics. 13 Part II The L A T E X Graphics Bundle 7 EPS Graphics Inclusion The best reference for the graphics and graphicx packages is the graphics guide <ref> [5] </ref> or the L A T E X Graphics Companion [4]. <p> The distance that the background extends beyond the object is controlled by the "fboxsep length. For example, "colorbox-white--text places a rectangular white background behind text. See reference <ref> [5] </ref> for more details on "colorbox. With psfrag, "colorbox is useful for placing text at a location where lines or shading would make it difficult to view the text.

Reference: [7] <author> Michael C. Grant and David Carlisle, </author> <title> The psfrag system, </title> <note> version 3, Available as CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/supported/psfrag/pfgguide.ps </note>
Reference-contexts: Since psfrag 3.0 requires no preprocess-ing, it does not require any external programs such as perl or ghostscript. psfrag 3.0 only requires a recent L A T E X (12/95 or later) and the graphics bundle distributed with L A T E X. Reference <ref> [7] </ref> provides complete documentation on psfrag 3.0. An additional benefit of psfrag rewrite is that it now supports compressed eps graphics. However, the "tex command (described in Section 14.3) cannot be used to embed L A T E X text in compressed graphics. <p> If the optional arguments are not issued, the point defaults to [Bl]. Any missing letters default to c (e.g., [ ] and [c] are equivalent to [cc], [l] is equivalent to [lc]). See <ref> [7] </ref> for examples of various combinations of placement points. Note that "psfrag matches entire text strings. Thus the command "psfrag-pi--$"pi$- replaces the string pi with , but does not affect the strings pi/2 or 2pi. <p> An alternative, less efficient, method for using psfrag is the "tex command, which embeds the L A T E X text directly in the eps file. See <ref> [7] </ref> for more information. 14.4 Figure and Text Scaling with PSfrag If a graphic using psfrag is scaled, the psfrag text is scaled along with the graphic. <p> Since psfrag replaces the new text during the graphics inclusion, the second command scales the new psfrag text while the first command does not. When the included size of the eps graphic greatly differs from its natural size, the two commands produce very different results. See <ref> [7] </ref> for more information on the scaling of psfrag text. 34 14.5 PSfrag Incompatibilities While psfrag 3.0 has many advantages over version 2, it currently has an incompatibility with eps files produced by Xfig which contain pattern-filled objects. The psfrag distribution includes the file readme.xfg which describe this incompatibility.

Reference-contexts: example, these commands produce a 2-inch wide graphic and another graphic whose totalheight is 1 inch. 15.2 Graphics in Page Header or Footer An easy method of including graphics in the heading is to use the fancyhdr package (an improved version of the old fancyheadings package) which is documented by <ref> [12] </ref>. The header consists of three parts: its left field, its center field, and its right field. The "fancyhead command specifies the contents of the header fields, with the L,C,R options specifying which field (s) the command modifies.
