Abstract: Simulation studies of circuit switched networks with dynamic alternate routing reveal the existence of hysteresis phenomena, which suggest that such networks can admit more than one regime of operation for the same offered traffic. Such behaviour is also suggested by a detailed analytical model due to Marbukh, and a simpler model due to Gibbens, Hunt, and Kelly. In these models, a limit is taken as the network size becomes large, and one finds a limiting ODE describing the proportions of network links in different states. The possibility of multiple regimes of operation shows up through the fact that the ODE has multiple equilibrium points for certain ranges of parameters. The kinds of limits considered by Marbukh and Gibbens, Hunt and Kelly do not take into account the spatial extent of the network. In an attempt to preserve the spatial characteristics we consider a lattice model similar to that of Gibbens, Hunt and Kelly. We derive a hydrodynamic equation for this lattice model. This is an integro-differential equation which describes how the spatial distribution of the network evolves in time. The hydrodynamic equation also admits multiple spatially homogeneous equilibrium solutions for certain ranges of the parameters, which may be loosely thought of as the different operating regimes. This equation may be particularly useful in understanding the exchange between the operating regimes, i.e. questions like "for what parameter values is a hot spot of heavy loading in the system likely to take over the whole network by knock-on effects ?"

Reference-contexts: ODE limits are found for the fraction of network links that are in a given state as the network size becomes large. This work is briefly discussed in Section 2. The focus of this paper is on understanding the interaction between the operating regimes using particle system techniques, [10], <ref> [17] </ref>. To describe the dynamic exchange between different operating regimes, we need simple equations that describe how the spatially distributed network state evolves over time. Motivated by this we consider a lattice model in Section 3, which is analogous to the model of Gibbens, Hunt and Kelly, [13]. <p> See Liggett, <ref> [17] </ref>, Chapter 1, Section 3, for details; Theorem 3.9 of that section applies directly. We think of each site in the lattice as representing a link in our network, which consists of C circuits.

A difficulty associated with dynamic routing schemes is the potential for metastable states. <p> Important performance characteristics of the network such as blocking probabilities typically differ considerably between regimes. All the same, the improvement in performance over hierarchical routing schemes is such that dynamic routing schemes are being implemented in real world networks, [13], <ref> [23] </ref>, with control schemes, such as trunk reservation for directly routed traffic.
