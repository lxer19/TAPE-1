Reference-contexts: Before proceeding to a discussion of DEMANDS and MOVEMENT REQUIREMENTS, we introduce some basic temporal concepts that are to be assumed. 5.1 TEMPORAL PRIMITIVES In what follows, we assume the existence of basic temporal concepts such as TIME-INTERVALS and TIME-POINTS (c.f. <ref> [ Allen, 1984 ] </ref> ). Additional useful time concepts are: 13 CALENDAR: a system for dividing up time that establishes a point of refer ence and units for counting time. TIME-UNIT: The granularity of the time representation. It could be one hour, one minute, one second, one day.

Reference-contexts: The class library design and implementation underlying the OZONE framework (and the ontology which provides its conceptual foundation) have followed from retrospective analysis of these scheduling domains and systems (e.g., <ref> [ Becker & Daz-Herrera, 1994 ] </ref> ), together with application of object-oriented analysis and design principles [ Smith & Lassila, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: We say that the ACTIVITY consumes the RESOURCE. Though we could further distinguish a third class,RENEWABLE RESOURCES, to refer to RESOURCES that have their CAPACITY increased by ACTIVITIES <ref> [ Fadel, M.S. Fox, & Gruninger, 1994 ] </ref> , we instead consider production of RESOURCE CAPACITY to be a separable issue. In our model, ACTIVITIES utilize RESOURCES to produce PRODUCTS. <p> HOMOGENE OUS RESOURCE-POOLS can be further differentiated as: i. SIMPLE-CAPACITY POOL: A HOMOGENEOUS RESOURCE POOL which is composed of n UNIT-CAPACITY-RESOURCES and can thus simultaneously support n independent activities. This corresponds to the definition of CAPACITATED RESOUR CE given in <ref> [ Fadel, M.S. Fox, & Gruninger, 1994 ] </ref> . ii. STRUCTURED-CAPACITY POOL: A HOMOGENEOUS RESOURCE POOL composed of n BATCH-CAPACITY RESOURCES or n AGGREGATE RESOURCES of capacity c, having total CAPACITY n fl c.

Reference-contexts: PRODUCTS, DEMANDS, and RESOURCES define the set of ACTIVITIES to be scheduled and executed. All the requirements specified in the DEMAND, the special conditions established by the PRODUCT, and 51 the physical and technological aspects of RESOURCE usage are translated into a set CONSTRAINTS that directly affect the ACTIVITIES. <ref> [ Gruninger & Fox, 1994 ] </ref> defines ACTIVITY as the basic transformational action primitive with which processes and operations can be represented; it specifies how the world is changed.

Reference-contexts: of operations to a medical facility or to a safe area; and RE-DEPLOYMENT defined as the transfer of a unit, an individual, or supplies deployed in one area to another area, or to another location within the area, or to the zone of interior for the purpose of further employment <ref> [ Joint-Pub-1-02, 1994 ] </ref> . These phases can then be further decomposed according to the characteristics and requirements of the transportation activities involved. We will focus on the force deployment and sustainment phase as a means of presenting the ontology for the multi-modal transportation problem. <p> Two types of TRANSPORT TERMINALS are modeled: (a) SEAPORT or just PORTS (b) AERIAL PORTS or AIRPORTS The term PORT should not be used in conjunction with air facilities <ref> [ Joint-Pub-1-02, 1994 ] </ref> TERMINAL capacity is discussed in more details in sec tion 5.4.5. 3. AUXILIARY RESOURCES: secondary RESOURCES needed to support TERMINAL operations and TRANSPORT ACTIVITIES. Examples of these types of RESOURCES are equipment to on/offload cargo, pallets, containers, forklifts, ground crews.

Reference-contexts: When requirements exceed lift capacity, the requirements should be ordered by decreasing priority and higher priority requirements should be serviced first. The decreasing priority categories are <ref> [ Joint-Pub-4-01, 1997 ] </ref> : 1. PRIORITY 1: 29 (a) PRIORITY 1A: i. PRIORITY 1A1: A Presidentially directed mission. ii. PRIORITY 1A2: US Forces and other forces in combat. iii. PRIORITY 1A3: Programs approved by the President as na tional priority. iv. PRIORITY 1A4: Special weapons. (b) PRIORITY 1B: i.

Reference-contexts: COMMON USER SEALIFT ASSETS and NONCOMMON USER SEALIFT ASSETS. COMMON USER or CONVENTIONAL RESOURCES are those militarily useful merchant ships available for joint support of all Service's MOVEMENT REQUIREMENTS. NONCOMMON USER RESOURCES are not generally available to transport joint MOVEMENT REQUIREMENTS <ref> [ Joint-Pub-4.01.2, 1996 ] </ref> . COMMON USER RESOURCES can be divided into two categories: 1. DRY CARGO or FREIGHTERS: dry cargo ships are considered militarily useful if they can carry a minimum of 2,000 LONG TONS of cargo and the ability to carry unit equipment, ammunition, or sustaining supply.

Reference-contexts: phases or types of transportation activities: DEPLOYMENT that corresponds to the relocation of forces and material to the area of operations; SUSTAINMENT that is defined as the provision of personnel, logistics, and other support required to maintain and prolong operations or combat until accomplishment or revision of the mission objectives <ref> [ Joint-Pub-5-03.1, 1993 ] </ref> ; EVACUATION of patients, prisoners of war, and non-combatant personnel from the area of operations to a medical facility or to a safe area; and RE-DEPLOYMENT defined as the transfer of a unit, an individual, or supplies deployed in one area to another area, or to another <p> These planning processes are currently supported by the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) and the description here presented follows the terminology used in JOPES' manuals and publications <ref> [ Joint-Pub-5-03.1, 1993 ] </ref> . The two main process types are DELIBERATE PLANNING and CRISIS ACTION PLANNING . Campaign planning is a more general process that begins with deliberate planning and continues through crisis action planning. <p> TIME-HORIZON: the number of time units between CURRENT-TIME and a point in time beyond which scheduling decisions are not important or should not be considered. TIME-INFINITE: the largest number of time units that can be used. Some useful military terms for describing specific time point are <ref> [ Joint-Pub-5-03.1, 1993 ] </ref> : C-day: The unnamed day on which a deployment operations commences or is to commence. D-day: The unnamed day on which a particular operation commences or is to commence. M-day: The unnamed day on which full mobilization commences or is to com mence.

Reference-contexts: The TOVE Enterprise Ontology [ Fadel, M.S. Fox, & Gruninger, 1994, Gruninger & Fox, 1994 ] defines a fairly comprehensive (although not particularly scalable) model of a simple capacity resource and other scheduling-related efforts (e.g., <ref> [ Le Pape, 1994 ] </ref> ) 7 have defined a number of additional types of resource models. Perhaps the most substantial ontology developed to date from the standpoint of scheduling and resource allocation is the OZONE scheduling ontology [ Smith, Lassila, & Becker, 1996 ] .

Reference-contexts: The state of the world in the enterprise ontology is designated by STATE of AFFAIRS. An important concept associated to this definition of ACTIVITY is the concept of DOER, ACTOR or AGENT, the entity that performs the ACTIVITY. Considering the ACTOR entity, <ref> [ Tate, 1996 ] </ref> makes a distinction between ACTION and EVENT: An ACTION is an ACTIVITY done, performed, or executed by a known AGENT; while an EVENT is an ACTIVITY done by an unknown AGENT.

Reference-contexts: Two representative examples of work in the area of common plan representations are the OMWG Core Plan Representation model [ Pease & Carrico, 1997 ] and the current DARPA SPAR (Shared Planning and Activity Representation) development effort <ref> [ Tate, 1997 ] </ref> . Broadly characterizing both of these efforts, the principal thrust has been on the development of a core planning model that is broadly applicable to many planning domains. <p> Given a solution method that incorporates these capabilities, the ontology provides a direct basis for its customization to match the resources in any target domain. According to <ref> [ Tate, 1997 ] </ref> , a relationship is an association between two or more entities, and are separate entities in their own right rather than being incorporated into attributes or properties of the entities related. In OZONE however, relationships other than constraints are not explicitly represented. <p> In OZONE however, relationships other than constraints are not explicitly represented. Including them in the presentation of the ontology would require an extra terminology that is not supported by the underlying implementation. Therefore relations among different entities are presented as properties of both entities. Using <ref> [ Tate, 1997 ] </ref> example, the relation performs (activity, agent) is represented by the activity having an agent property, and by the agent having an activity (or activity to perform) property. In the remainder of this section, we summarize the basic components of the OZONE scheduling ontology. <p> In this sense, an AGENT uses a RESOURCE to process an ACTIVITY. In some cases, (e.g., the crew of an aircraft) a RESOURCE may simultaneously assume the role of the AGENT. For administrative purposes, three types of AGENTS can be identified: * ACTOR: the motive force behind the ACTIVITY <ref> [ Tate, 1997 ] </ref> . The ACTOR is the agent that create the conditions necessary for the execution of the ACTIVITY. * RESPONSIBLE AGENT or OWNER: the AGENT responsible for the execution of the ACTIVITY [ Uschold et al., 1996 ] .

Reference-contexts: We say that the ACTIVITY uses the RESOURCE <ref> [ Uschold et al., 1996 ] </ref> (b) A CONSUMABLE RESOURCE, is one whose CAPACITY, once allocated to an ACTIVITY does not become available again. We say that the ACTIVITY consumes the RESOURCE. <p> The conditions that should hold in order for the ACTIVITY be executed are called ENABLING STATE, and the conditions that hold after the ACTIVITY has been executed are called CAUSED STATE. A similar definition of ACTIVITY is provided by <ref> [ Uschold et al., 1996 ] </ref> : an ACTIVITY is something done over a particular time interval. An ACTIVITY has PRE-CONDITIONS, EFFECTS, is performed by one or more DOERS, can be decomposed into SUB-ACTIVITIES, use or consumes RESOURCES, has AUTHORITY requirements, and has an associated OWNER. <p> The ACTOR is the agent that create the conditions necessary for the execution of the ACTIVITY. * RESPONSIBLE AGENT or OWNER: the AGENT responsible for the execution of the ACTIVITY <ref> [ Uschold et al., 1996 ] </ref> . Being responsible means having the capability of performing the ACTIVITY but does not mean actually executing the ACTIVITY.
