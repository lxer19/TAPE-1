Abstract: Given a collection of strings S = fs 1 ; : : : ; s n g over an alphabet , a superstring ff of S is a string containing each s i as a substring; that is, for each i, 1 i n, ff contains a block of js i j consecutive characters that match s i exactly. The shortest superstring problem is the problem of finding a superstring ff of minimum length. The shortest superstring problem has applications in both data compression and computational biology. It was shown by Blum et al. [3] to be MAX SNP-hard. The first O(1)-approximation algorithm also appeared in [3], which returns a superstring no more than 3 times the length of an optimal solution. Prior to the algorithm described in this paper, there were several published results that improved on the approximation ratio; of these, the best is our algorithm ShortString, a 2 3 4 -approximation [1]. We present our new algorithm, G-ShortString, which achieves a ratio of 2 2 3 . Our approach builds on the work in [1], in which we identified classes of strings that have a nested periodic structure, and which must be present in the worst case for our algorithms. We introduced paper we extend this study to strings that exhibit a more relaxed form of the same structure, and we use this understanding to obtain our improved result. 1 Introduction machinery to describe these strings and proved strong structural properties about them.

We show that by more carefully choosing representatives in Step (2), we can combine Steps (4) and (6) to produce a shorter superstring. We now summarize our analysis of Generic; more details can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. For a cycle fl 2 CC, let ov n fl be the overlap of the edge deleted in Step (4); this represents the cost of breaking the CC cycle fl to form a superstring of the representatives in fl. <p> Our machinery for analyzing 2-cycles gives rise to our algorithm as well as our analysis. In this section we describe this machinery, first developed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Suppose we choose v and t as representatives of two cycles of the first cycle cover C, and they form a 2-cycle fl in CC in which one of ov (v; t) or ov (t; v) is large but the other is small. <p> We apply Corollary 2.3 and the definition of 2 3 -repeater to get jj + j 0 j &gt; ov (y; y 0 ) &gt; 3 ) jj &gt; 3 1 j 0 j; which implies jj &gt; 1 2 d (c) because jj &gt; j 0 j. In <ref> [2] </ref> we showed that 3 4 -repeaters are well parenthesized; that is, that the characteristics of 3 4 -repeaters may be disjoint or nested, but never linked. The proof of this strong structural char acterization was nontrivial, and very sensitive to the value of g = 3 4 . <p> In order to prove the lemma, we require a proof technique introduced in <ref> [2] </ref>, the shift argument. We describe this technique below. 11 ( ) - ( ) - ( ) - s ' X y' y' 8 We apply the shift argument to cycles that include two or more repeaters.

Reference-contexts: The shortest superstring problem is the problem of finding a superstring ff of minimum length. The shortest superstring problem was shown to be NP-hard by Gallant, Maier and Storer [9]; it was later shown to be MAX SNP-hard <ref> [3] </ref>. The first O (1)-approximations were given by Blum et al. in [3], who showed that a greedy algorithm always returns a string that is no longer than four times optimal; they also give a modified greedy algorithm which returns a string that is no more three times the optimal length. <p> The shortest superstring problem was shown to be NP-hard by Gallant, Maier and Storer [9]; it was later shown to be MAX SNP-hard <ref> [3] </ref>.

In particular, the 3-approximation of <ref> [3] </ref> uses a theorem about infinite periodic functions [7], and the correspondence between periodic functions and strings in cycles. <p> Independently of our work, Jiang et al. [11] have also obtained a 2 2 3 -approximation using similar methods. More recently, Z Sweedyk [21] has obtained a 2 1 2 approximation. 2 Preliminaries For consistency, we use some notation and definitions of <ref> [3] </ref> and [22]. We assume, without loss of generality, that the set S of strings is substring free; i.e., no s j is a substring of s i , i 6= j. <p> Full extension, right extension and left extension each form superstrings that include all of the strings in c, as proved in <ref> [3] </ref>. Left and right extension form shorter superstrings than full extension, though perhaps by only one character. <p> We now describe a generic version of a superstring algorithm from <ref> [3] </ref> that is also used in some form by [22], [2], and [5]. An execution of the algorithm appears as Fig. 2. <p> Let z i = hx; fl i i!. (6) For each r c in ff Let r c = hhr c ; cii. (7) Return the resulting superstring ff. As shown in <ref> [3] </ref>, ff is a superstring of S. The cycle cover formed in Step (1) identifies sets of strings that have large amounts of overlap. <p> We note three details in anticipation of our algorithm presented in Section 4. In Step (2), Generic chooses representatives arbitrarily; the analysis works with any choice. In Step (4), the algorithm of <ref> [3] </ref> deletes the minimum-overlap edge in each cycle fl 2 CC. In Step (6), each representative is fully extended. We show that by more carefully choosing representatives in Step (2), we can combine Steps (4) and (6) to produce a shorter superstring. <p> It can be shown that jffj opt (S) + X fl + Ext (fl) : (4) The following key lemma from <ref> [3] </ref> is essential to this analysis: Lemma 2.1 ([3]) Let c and c 0 be cycles in a minimum cycle cover C with strings s 2 c and s 0 2 c 0 . <p> We define a few terms describing the structure of cycles. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for a more complete discussion. We call a string s irreducible if all cyclic shifts of s yield unique strings, and reducible otherwise. We say that s has periodicity x if there exists a string t with jtj = x such that s is substring of t 1 . <p> There is also a gap between the best proven bound on the performance of a simple greedy algorithm for the problem <ref> [3] </ref>, a 4-approximation, and the lower bound of 2 for that algorithm. This gap is of particular interest because the greedy algorithm is simple and fast and therefore is used in practice for DNA sequencing.

In particular, the 3-approximation of [3] uses a theorem about infinite periodic functions <ref> [7] </ref>, and the correspondence between periodic functions and strings in cycles. However, the particular instances of cycle patching that appear to be difficult actually involve short periodic strings, that is, strings that are periodic, but whose period may repeat only slightly more than once.

Reference-contexts: Since jpref (s i ; s j )j js i j, we can conclude that opt (T SP ) opt (S), where opt (T SP ) is the optimal solution to TSP defined above. This TSP is directed (sometimes called asymmetric); thus the best known approximation <ref> [8] </ref> is only within a factor of O (log n). Therefore, we must exploit more of the structure of the problem in order to achieve better bounds.
