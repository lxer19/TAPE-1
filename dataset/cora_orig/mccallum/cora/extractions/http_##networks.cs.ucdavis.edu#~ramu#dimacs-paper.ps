Title: Fault-Tolerant Design of Wavelength-Routed Optical Networks  
Author: S. Ramamurthy and Biswanath Mukherjee 
Note: DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science  
Abstract: This paper considers optical networks which employ wavelength-routing switches that enable the establishment of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels, called lightpaths, between node-pairs. In such networks, the failure of a single fiber link may cause the failure of several optical channels. Given a set of lightpaths, that may comprise of a logical topology, and alternate routing tables at each node, this paper examines the following problem: how to allocate capacity in an optimal fashion and assign routes and wavelengths to each lightpath, such that, upon any link failure, lightpaths that are affected by the failure can be reestablished without any blocking. A simple approach, called one-on-one protection, protects against link failures by reserving for each lightpath, a link-disjoint backup lightpath. In this paper, we present an alternate protection scheme called multiplexed-spare-capacity protection, that multiplexes the spare capacity among all lightpaths in the logical topology in an optimal fashion. This paper examines the performance (in terms of capacity utilization) of this approach on representative network topologies, and shows that this approach is superior to one-on-one protection.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [1] </ref> divides the tremendous bandwidth of a fiber (potentially a few tens of terabits per second) into many nonoverlapping wavelengths (WDM channels). Each channel can be operated asynchronously and in parallel at any desirable speed, e.g., peak electronic speed of a few Gbps.

Reference-contexts: The electronic packet-switching may be performed by an ATM switch (or an IP router), in which case the logical topology is operated as an ATM network (or IP network). In this context, we define the routing and wavelength assignment problem <ref> [2] </ref> as follows: Given a traffic demand (i.e., the number of lightpaths between each node-pair that comprises a logical topology), route and assign wavelengths to the lightpaths such that some network criteria (such as capacity utilization) is optimized. <p> Solution Approach The routing and wavelength assignment problem has been shown to be NP-complete <ref> [2] </ref>. We expect the one-on-one protection problem, and the multiplexed-spare-capacity protection problems to be NP-complete as well. We have used a freeware LP/ILP solver called lpSolve, to solve the instances of the ILPs generated for two representative network topologies.

Reference-contexts: FAULT-TOLERANT DESIGN OF WAVELENGTH-ROUTED OPTICAL NETWORKS 3 such a failure can lead to a severe disruption in the network. There are several approaches to ensure network survivability <ref> [3] </ref>. The approach we consider here is that of restoration, where lightpaths affected by a component failure are rerouted around the failure, by reconfiguring network components such as wavelength-routing switches, transmitters, receivers, etc. <p> Our work considers a path-restoration-based approach utilizing multiplexed-spare-capacity, for protection against link failure in an optical networks, and in this manner is different from previous work. Network survivability, restoration schemes, and optimal spare-capacity design have been studied extensively in circuit-switched transport networks <ref> [3, 12, 13, 14] </ref>. 1.2. Outline of remaining sections. In Section 2, we develop the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations of the one-on-one and multiplexed-spare-capacity protection problems. A solution approach for the ILP formulation, and the complexity of the solution procedure is considered in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: RAMAMURTHY AND BISWANATH MUKHERJEE In the following subsections, we define the algorithm to find routes for lightpaths between node-pairs in the network, and then we develop the notation to describe the ILPs. 2.1. Routing. We assume that alternate routing <ref> [4] </ref> is utilized to perform the routing of lightpaths in the network. Alternate routing requires each node in the network to have a routing table. The routing table at a node contains a set of precomputed routes to each destination node.

Reference-contexts: We examine two approaches to path restoration: (a) one-on-one protection, and (b) multiplexed-spare-capacity protection. These two approaches perform path restoration upon link failures and are based on precomputed routes. * One-on-one protection: One-on-one protection <ref> [5] </ref> reserves a backup light-path for every lightpath that needs to be protected against link failures. The backup lightpaths are designed such that they do not share any links with their corresponding primary lightpaths. When a primary lightpath fails because of a link failure, its backup lightpath is activated. <p> Primary Lightpath Backup Lightpath 10 ! 6 (10,11,1,6) on 1 (10,9,7,6) on 1 Table 2.

Reference-contexts: It is beneficial to consider restoration mechanisms in the optical layer for the following reasons <ref> [7] </ref>: (a) the optical layer can efficiently multiplex protection resources (such as spare wavelengths and fibers) among several higher layer network applications, and (b) optical layer restoration provides protection to higher layer protocols that may not have built-in protection.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we provide numerical results for capacity utilization, and make qualitative comments on the restoration time and complexity of the different protection approaches. We performed our studies on two representative networks: (a) a network of interconnected rings illustrated in Fig. 1, and (b) the European optical network <ref> [15] </ref> illustrated in Fig. 2. These topologies were chosen to be representative of typical mesh topologies employed in telecommunications networks. For each network topology and between each node-pair, we chose a set of three alternate routes, ensuring that at least two routes were link disjoint.
