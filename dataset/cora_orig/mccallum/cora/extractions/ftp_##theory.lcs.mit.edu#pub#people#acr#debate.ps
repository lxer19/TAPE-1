Abstract: In 1990, PSPACE was shown to be identical to IP, the class of languages with interactive proofs [18, 20]. Recently, PSPACE was again recharacterized, this time in terms of (Random) Probabilistically Checkable Debate Systems [7, 8]. In particular, it was shown that PSPACE = PCDS[log n; 1] = RPCDS[log n; 1]. We study the relativized behaviour of the classes defined by these debate systems in comparison with the classes IP and PSPACE. For the relationships between (R)PCDS[r(n); a(n)] and IP and (R)PCDS[r(n); a(n)] and PSPACE we determine a natural boundary (in terms of the parameters r(n) and a(n)) separating direct-simulability and inequality (with probability 1). In addition, we show that if 9O; EXP O = PCDS O [log n; log n] then P 6= PSPACE.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Definitions The notion of relativization was introduced by Baker, Gill, and Solovay <ref> [4] </ref> in an attempt to explain the difficulty of the famous P ? = NP question. The attachment of oracles to different classes of machines, in general, is a method for exaggerating (perhaps small) differences in the computational ability of these classes.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the presentation of contradictory relativizations of a relationship between two complexity classes has been a standard tool for arguing the difficulty of precisely determining that relationship. The notion of relativization was strengthened by the consideration of random oracles <ref> [5] </ref>. In the words of Bennett and Gill: fl E-mail address: acr@theory.lcs.mit.edu.

In this new framework, a conjectured relationship may be supported by showing that it holds with probability 1 relative to a random oracle. <p> From (1), (2) and (3) it follows that for n &gt; ~n, Pr [ n ] &lt; 1 4e Furthermore, for m &gt; n i , n and m are independent (or use Lemma 1 of <ref> [5] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Finally, in the same vein as <ref> [9] </ref>, we show that if 9O; EXP O = PCDS O [log n; log n] then P 6= PSPACE.

Theorem 2.9 ([9]) If 9O fl so that PCP O [log n; 1] = EXP O then P 6= NP. <p> This may be done by presentation of (perhaps contrived) complexity classes with a somehow simpler (algebraic) proof of equality which exhibit this behaviour. Alternatively, this may be done by presentation of a new framework (perhaps just a new oracle-access mechanism <ref> [9] </ref>), analogous to relativization, in which these techniques behave well. 4 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Joan Feigenbaum and Lance Fortnow for helpful discussions. We would also like to thank the anonymous referees, who gave an improved proof of Theorem 2.4 (2) and improved the general presentation.
