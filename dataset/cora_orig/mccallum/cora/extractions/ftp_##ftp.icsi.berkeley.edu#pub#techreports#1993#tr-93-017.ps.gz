Abstract: A specific class of multimedia applications is expected to be of importance for future communication networks: Multi-Party Interactive Multimedia (MIM). Based on the isolation and characterization of MIM applications, concrete network support requirements are derived in this paper. The varying degree of connectivity, the vastly different sizes in terms of participants and the reliance on a guaranteed Quality of Service make MIM support a difficult problem. Starting with the definition of multimedia communication abstractions, principles of solutions are sketched. For an important subclass of applications a particularly efficient and practicable alternative implementation based on half-duplex channels is introduced. Finally, interfaces at both the transport and network layers are considered.

Reference-contexts: Since the control capabilities requested from a protocol providing guaranteed communication are increasing in complexity, we propose a clear separation of Data and Control, extending the model proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. For example, aspects of data representation, fragmentation, and re-assembly are all data-related functions, while channel establishment, admission control, and dynamic joining/leaving are control-related functions. In the subsequent sections we will concentrate on the interfaces that belong to the control-related application-specific subset.

Reference-contexts: Since the target environment is often that of technical and commercial enterprises, access control has usually to be enforced. Another example is the so-called Virtual Cafe. The idea is to allow users at different sites to communicate informally through an electronic common space <ref> [2] </ref>. However, due to the informal nature of this model, access control is generally not of concern and scheduling is usually limited to the specification of some "opening hours". Table 2 lists these new applications.

Reference-contexts: To avoid confusion, we included in Appendix A a list of terms that will be extensively used in the rest of the paper. Other proposals have been presented in the literature for the classification of MIM applications from the viewpoint of the support they require from the communication subsystem <ref> [3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17] </ref>. In this paper we propose a different approach to such classification based on the identification of a set of basic functional characteristics that this class of multimedia applications exhibits.

Reference-contexts: No specification is given regarding the quality of the communication service provided by means of such an abstraction. However, a real-time communication is actually characterized by a specification of the performance of the communication <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The second goal is to still accomplish this result with a guaranteed quality of service according to the Tenet approach to real-time networking <ref> [5] </ref>. The solution we propose is based on a new abstraction, called the Half-Duplex Real-Time Channel. This solution reduces the complexity of the creation of network support for common MIM applications, and decreases the amount of resources to be reserved in the network. <p> The first solution we propose is based on the simplex multicast connection, and will be presented in the framework of the Tenet real-time protocol suite <ref> [5] </ref>. We have individuated two main reasons for adopting such solution. The first one is that mechanisms for an efficient implementation of multicast communication begin to be available in a number of packet-switching networks.

Reference-contexts: The real-time channel defined above is meant as a single media, virtual connection among a set of network nodes and it is intended to be an extension of the definition of real-time channel as originally introduced in <ref> [6] </ref>. Each node participates to the connection as a source or as a sink of data, and is characterized by its own performance specification. <p> The second is that a simplex multicast channel is a good compromise between the need of a mechanism more powerful than the simplex channel solution (on which the first Tenet scheme was originally based <ref> [6] </ref>), and the need of not to adopt mechanisms too powerful to be efficiently implemented. <p> To understand if the mutual exclusion condition can be exploited to reduce the amount of resources required we will focus our attention to the local tests. The procedure for the establishment of a guaranteed real-time channel is described in detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> This is indicated using the notation "delay-bound D 2 [D max ; D max + D max ]" 3 . The traffic and performance characterizing parameters have been introduced in <ref> [6] </ref>. 10.1 Transport Layer The transport layer provides the control abstraction for single-media logical channels with QoS. It computes the routes and the resource requirements. The resource requirements include necessary buffer space as well as parameters such as locally permissible scheduling delays. <p> Note that the network layer implements rate controlling by making sure that the channel does not exceed the assigned resources and by dropping packets otherwise. This is important to ensure proper protection of other real- and non-real-time channels from a malfunctioning real-time channel client <ref> [6] </ref>. 11 Conclusions MIM applications are very demanding in terms of network support. We have shown that some characteristics of such applications can be effectively exploited to reduce the amount of resources required to provide quality-of-service guarantees in communication.

A basic criterion could be that the participants involved are assumed to be subject to real-time constraints, and are, in some sense, "interactive".

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multimedia applications, in particular those based on multi-party interactive multimedia (MIM) <ref> [10] </ref>, show an inherent complexity, stemming from the different media they use and the large number of participants they might involve. Due to their origin from interpersonal communication models, multi-party interactive applications have been, in general, rather vaguely defined.

By size we refer to the expected bound on the number of participants. In particular, we are interested in how support from a real-time communication subsystem has to cope with this aspect.

Reference-contexts: Floor-control mechanisms within the network protocols can thus be avoided (e.g. <ref> [18] </ref>). 14 A new abstraction called the half-duplex real-time channel can now be introduced. The major problem of this introduction is that the reservation mechanisms in the Tenet scheme are dependent on the data direction over the channel.
