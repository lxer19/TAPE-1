Abstract: In today's class, we completed our discussion of recognizing prime numbers. The source of today's lecture is a reading from the Handbook of Applied Cryptography [3] . In addition, we began discussing about elliptic curves.

Reference-contexts: When Miller-Rabin returns that n is a prime, we repeat the algorithm to gain confidence in the result. Example 1.3. Given n = 21, we can write n 1 = 2 2 5. Then s = 2 and d = 5. Choose a 2 <ref> [1; 20] </ref> at random; in class, we chose a = 6. Compute a 0 = a 5 mod 21 = 6.

Reference-contexts: Return "composite". Certificates of Primality We have discussed algorithms that recognize primes and composites. We may also want to construct an output that certifies that an input n is prime. One such output relies on the following property of prime numbers. Theorem 1.4. (see Kilian <ref> [2] </ref>) Suppose that for some a 2 (Z=(n)) fl and some integer q &gt; p have gcd (a 1; n) = 1 and a q 1 (mod n). If q is prime, then n is prime.
