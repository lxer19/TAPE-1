Abstract: Skyscraper Broadcasting is a recent statically scheduled broadcast technique for video-on-demand that addresses the network-I/O bottleneck to provide significantly superior performance over previous approaches. In this paper, we define a scheme for dynamically scheduling the objects that are broadcast on the skyscraper channels and show that yet another significant improvement in performance can be obtained. The dynamic broadcasting scheme is designed to provide all clients with the precise time at which their requested object will be broadcast, or an upper bound on that time if the delay is small. New segment size progressions are proposed that (1) facilitate dynamic scheduling, (2) simplify the server disk layout problem, and (3) support clients with inexpensive settops that can buffer only one or two frames. Finally, we develop a simple analytic formula that aids in selecting optimal skyscraper configurations for a given request arrival rate, set of object selection frequencies, and target system cost. Preliminary simulation results show that 1) the dynamic scheme provides factors of two to ten improvement in mean client waiting time, or conversely delivers a given target average client waiting time with a significantly lower number of channels as compared with the statically scheduled system, 2) the dynamic system outperforms the static system with respect to variability in client waiting time, and 3) clients with inexpensive (diskless) settops can receive a reasonable level of service while clients with more expensive settops are provided with a high level of service that is relatively isolated from detrimental performance impact from the diskless clients, for the dynamic scheme that is defined in this paper.

Reference-contexts: modeled by the Zipf (0) distribution, the most popular object is selected with probability 13% and the 100th most popular object is selected with probability 0.0013; this distribution matches reasonably well with a particular measurement of the selection frequencies of the 100 most popular objects in a video rental outlet <ref> [6] </ref>. In this case 80% of the requests are for the 224 most popular objects, which is a popular definition of the hot set.

Reference-contexts: One motivation for dynamic skyscraper scheduling is that recent evaluation of conventional broadcasting schemes has shown that periodic broadcast of the hot objects on isolated groups of channels is not necessarily superior to dynamically scheduling all objects on all available channels <ref> [12] </ref>. Another motivation is that there may not be a clear distinction between hot and cold objects in many video-on-demand systems; furthermore, the particular objects that happen to be most popular may change with the time of day or as new objects are installed. <p> First, recent results show that for fixed length objects, FCFS outperforms other scheduling algorithms such as maximum queue length first (MQL) or maximum factored queue length first (MFQ) if both the mean and the variability in client waiting time are considered <ref> [12] </ref>. Second, the broadcast assignment can be done when the request arrives, and thus the system can immediately inform the client when the broadcast will begin. 2.2.3 Temporary Channel Stealing Several optimizations of the above dynamic skyscraper scheme are possible. <p> For the dynamic 4 Recall that, among the channel scheduling policies that have been proposed to date for conventional broadcasts, FCFS has the best performance when both mean and variability in client waiting time are considered <ref> [12] </ref>. 17 skyscraper scheme, the only constraint on K is that it evenly divide the number of channels assigned to the hot or cold set.
