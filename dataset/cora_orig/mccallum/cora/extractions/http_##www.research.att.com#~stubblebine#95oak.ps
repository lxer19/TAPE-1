Abstract: A general method is described for formally specifying and reasoning about distributed systems with any desired degree of immediacy for revoking authentication. To effect revocation, authenticating entities impose freshness constraints on credentials or authenticated statements made by trusted intermediaries. If fresh statements are not presented, then the authentication is questionable. Freshness constraints are derived from initial policy assumptions and authentic statements made by trusted intermediaries. By adjusting freshness constraints, the delay for certain revocation can be arbitrarily bounded. We illustrate how the inclusion of freshness policies within certificates enables the design of a secure and highly available revocation service. We illustrate the application of the method and new techniques in an example.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that recent-secure authentication policies are an important variable for reassessing shifting risk in large distributed systems. For example, proposals have been made to assign financial liability attributes to certificate authority statements in financial systems based on shifting risk <ref> [2] </ref>. Our method suggests that recent-secure policies should be associated with statements of authentication liability. The concept of recent-secure authentication/authorization is related in spirit to other systems concepts. <p> Our interpretation reasserts the original statement and the notafter time is set for the new time. If the timestamp is present we annotate the time of the statement. suspended: indicates the certificate should be temporarily suspended (analogous to the certificate on hold option in <ref> [2] </ref>). Our interpretation consists of two statements: a statement indicating a notafter time set sooner than the original certificate, and a new statement with a notbefore time set later.

Reference-contexts: Understanding revocation is an important business concern to service providers as well as to users of an authentication service; it has been estimated that the yearly running expenses of an authentication infrastructure derive mainly from administrating revocation <ref> [3] </ref>. A service for revoking authentication should have the following desirable properties: Definite. Revocation should be fail-safe or assured with bounded delays. Available and Recent. The mechanisms for posting and retrieving updates must be highly available and retrieved information should be recent (if not current). Adjustable.

Reference-contexts: Public key crytposystems like RSA [22] and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) <ref> [6] </ref> have a private key that is kept secret and a public key that can be published to others.

Reference-contexts: Apparent countermeasures to these attacks may not be adequate. For example, consider the technique of cascaded delegation where a delegation certificate is created as a delegation is passed to each new system <ref> [8] </ref>. To terminate a delegation, a tear down order is passed down the chain. (This is analogous to the notification mechanism discussed in Section 4.3). However, due to unreliable communication or a compromise of an intermediate system, the order may not fully propagate.

Reference-contexts: In particular, authentication requires trusted on-line interaction potentially with numerous intermediate servers for each initial authentication.

Reference-contexts: However, network failures can significantly impact the availability of such servers for geographically distributed clients. Replicating trusted servers, to increase the availability, inherently increases the risk of compromising the secret keys held by the server. Secret-sharing techniques can improve availability and security <ref> [11] </ref>, but they do so at the expense of considerable communication costs and increased delay. For example, the effective time of the statement from the quorum might be the earliest statement time in a final round used to make the decision.

Reference-contexts: The concept of recent-secure authentication/authorization is related in spirit to other systems concepts. In particular, it can be related to a hybrid optimistic/pessimistic method of concurrency control that allows for the selective application of the most efficient method characterized by the probability of conict <ref> [12] </ref>. For example, small freshness intervals correspond to pessimistic methods requiring more expensive mechanisms than those required by larger intervals. 3. THEORY In this section, we present a theory for specifying temporal features of statements made by entities, and we present rules for reasoning about them.

An off-line identification authority generates long-term certificates and an on-line revocation authority creates countersigned certificates with short lifetimes. The effective lifetime is the minimum lifetime of both certificates.

Reference-contexts: Application servers can choose to reject the credentials if the authtime is not recent even if the ticket is still within its valid lifetime. 3 A recent proposal calls for public key extensions for initial authentication <ref> [20] </ref>. With the exception of public-key authentication during initial log in, all protocols remain the same. The implication of recent-secure authentication is that application servers need to know that their recent-secure authentication requirements are satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Loosely synchronized clocks are used to expire keys, and to age statements. The accuracy of clock synchronization constrains the granularity for aging statements and expiring keys. Granularity constraints on expiring keys is not a practical problem in situations where sufficiently pessimistic assumptions can be made in assigning key lifetimes <ref> [25] </ref>. However, granularity is an issue for fail-safe revocation since the practical bound on revocation may need to be on the order of tens of minutes or less. The reliance on clock synchronization for refreshing statements makes recent-secure authentication susceptible to vulnerabilities due to clock failures [4,10,16].
