Abstract: The Available Bit Rate (ABR) flow control specification for ATM networks has recently been completed by the ATM Forum. However, the excessive complexity of the specified scheme and the uncertainty about its performance make it costly and risky to implement ABR flow control in hardware. This paper presents a software approach for implementing ABR flow control in source/destination systems to reduce hardware complexity and allow flexibility and upgradability in implementing ABR flow control. The proposed approach is currently being implemented in DART anATM network This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Virtual source/destination systems can be used to connect subnet-works.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism is used to self-limit the transmission of a connection when a processor fails to timely process requests in the PRQ. It can also be used to implement credit-based flow control schemes such as the one specified in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Additional/alternative processing can be performed to enhance ATM Forum's flow control scheme or implement other flow control schemes. The DART chip also has additional hardware support to allow implementation of Quantum Flow Control as specified by the Flow Control Consortium <ref> [2] </ref>. Space limitations preclude a discussion of further details here.

Reference-contexts: A longer interrupt period is equivalent to making the feedback loop longer. We will investigate its impact to the flow control responsiveness and performance by using an ATM network simulator developed by NIST <ref> [6] </ref> and a VERILOG model developed for the DART chip. In any case, the rapid roll out of fast PCs will diminish the relative overhead (We plan to redo the measurements on 160MHz Pentium-Pro PCs).
