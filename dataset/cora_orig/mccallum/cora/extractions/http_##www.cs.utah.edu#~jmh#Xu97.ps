Abstract: The goal of this research is to determine the joint mechanical properties of the freely moving human arm, by utilizing an unconstraining force perturbation device and developing nonlinear time-varying system identification methods. We formulate the human arm model in view of identification using perturbation, and present a pneumatic perturbation system and two identification methods, exponentially weighted least squares (EWLS) and highpass mean removal ensemble data (HRED). The experimental results on human elbow joint in posture and movement as well as the effect of the small perturbation on the joint dynamics are presented.

Reference-contexts: However, some methods have been adapted for the human joint study under certain conditions [5, 11]. Time-invariant methods [8] have been used most because voluntary input can be assumed constant during posture. Time-varying methods [10], temporal expansion methods (system's time variation is known a priori) [12], and ensemble methods <ref> [1, 11] </ref> were tried as well. The results from posture experiments are consistent. The results from the experiments with joint movements are not consistent because the movement tasks and methods used by different researchers are different [1, 9, 11]. Result verification is difficult because the true parameters are unknown. <p> The results from posture experiments are consistent.

Result verification is difficult because the true parameters are unknown. The two methods described in this paper operate in low and high frequency regions, respectively.

To prevent the division by zero, when the denominator is less than one, it is set to one.Typically, both VAFM and VAFV should be over 75% <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. movement without derivative measurements. The VAFM and VAFV of the other parameters are higher. In these simulations, = 20s 1 , which sets the weighting window width 5 times smaller than the fast human arm movement, 4Hz [1]. <p> The VAFM and VAFV of the other parameters are higher. In these simulations, = 20s 1 , which sets the weighting window width 5 times smaller than the fast human arm movement, 4Hz <ref> [1] </ref>. The lowpass filter cutoff frequency in (5) is 3:2Hz, which is chosen based on the requirement of 8 times reduction of the noise in the derivatives. The high-pass filtering cutoff frequency in (4) is 1 Hz. <p> The standard least square method may be applied to (9) to obtain the impedance parameters at each time instance. The critical issue is to align these input-output realizations from the movement task. Previous methods have been based on simple ensemble mean removal <ref> [1, 11] </ref>, which we call the Ensemble Mean Removal Ensemble Data (EMRED) method. The procedure is: 1. Lowpass filter each trial to low frequency trajectory lf (i; t) = a L (s)(i; t) where a L (s) is an acausal lowpass filter with no phase shift.
