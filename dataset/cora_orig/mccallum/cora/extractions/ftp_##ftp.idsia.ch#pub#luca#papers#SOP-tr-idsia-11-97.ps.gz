Abstract: We present HAS-SOP, a new approach to solving sequential ordering problems. HAS-SOP combines the ant colony algorithm, a population-based metaheuristic, with a new local optimizer, an extension of a TSP heuristic which directly handles multiple constraints without increasing computational complexity. We compare different implementation s of HAS-SOP and present a new data structure that improves system performance. Experimental results on a set of twenty-three test problems taken from the TSPLIB show that HAS-SOP outperforms existing methods both in terms of solution quality and computation time. Moreover, HAS-SOP improves most of the best known results for the considered problems.

Reference-contexts: F or example, multistart, that is , the application of local search to different initial solutions , has been found to be a poor choice, since the local search procedure spends most of its time improving the initial low quality solution <ref> (Aarts and Lenstra, 1997) </ref>. It therefore becomes interesting to find good metaheuristic-local optimizer couplings, where a coupling is good if the metaheuristic generates initial solutions that can be carried to very good local optima by the local optimizer.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will use this last formulation. 1.2 Heuristic methods for the SOP The SOP models real- world problems like production planning ( Escudero, 1988), single-vehicle routing problems with pickup and delivery constraints ( Pulleyblank and Timlin, 1991; Savelsbergh, 1990), and transportation problems in flexible manufacturing systems <ref> (Ascheuer, 1996) </ref>. The SOP can be seen as a general case of both the asymmetric TSP and the pickup and delivery problem. <p> Computational results We tested our algorithms o n a set of problems in TSP LIB (available at http://www.iwr.uni heidelberg.de/iwr/comopt/soft/TSPLIB95/TSPLIB.html). SOP problems in TSPLIB can be classified as follow s: a set of problems ( rbgxxxa) are real-life problems derived from a stacker crane application <ref> (Ascheuer, 1996) </ref>. These problems were originally defined as ATSPs with time windows: to obtain SOP instances time window precedences are relaxed to generate SOP precedences.

Reference-contexts: Approaches based on the ATSP . SOP problems were initially solved as constrained versions of the asymmetric TSP. The main effort has been in extending the mathematical definition of ATSP problems by introducing new equations to model constraints. The first mathematical model for SOP problems was introduced in <ref> ( Ascheuer et al. , 1993) </ref> where a cutting-plane approach was proposed to compute lower bounds on the optimal solution. In (Escudero et al., 1994) a Lagrangian relax-and-cut method was described and new valid cuts 4 to obtain strong lower bounds were defined.

Reference-contexts: In (Escudero et al., 1994) a Lagrangian relax-and-cut method was described and new valid cuts 4 to obtain strong lower bounds were defined. More recently, based on the polyhedral investigation carried out on ATSP problems with precedence constraints by <ref> ( Balas, Fischetti and Pulleyblank, 1995) </ref>, Ascheuer (1996) has proposed a new class of valid inequalities and has described a branch-and-cut algorithm for a broad class of SOP instances.

Reference-contexts: Also, we have recently applied HAS-QAP, an ant colony algorithm coupled with a simple form of local search, to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). HAS-QAP produced better solutions ( Gambardella, Taillard and Dorigo, 1997) than the best known algorithms on structured, real-world problem instances (comparison includes reactive tabu search <ref> (Battiti and Tecchioli, 1994) </ref>, robust tabu search (Taillard, 1991), simulated annealing (Connolly, 1990), and genetic hybrid search (Fleurent and Ferland, 1994)). In this paper we attack the sequential ordering problem (SOP) by an ant colony algorithm coupled with a modified version of the 3-opt search procedure.

Reference-contexts: Differently, we decrease the number of visited nodes introducing two heuristics that influence how node h is chosen: one is based on the dont look bit data structure introduced path-right 0 j j+ 1 i i+ 1 h h+ 1 n H path-left 14 by Bentley <ref> (Bentley, 1992) </ref>, while the other is based on a new data structure called dont push stack introduced by the authors . The dont look bit is a data structure in which a bit is associated with each node of the sequence.

Reference-contexts: One of the most recent nature- inspired metaheuristics is ant colony optimization ( Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni, 1991; 1996; Dorigo, 1992). There, the inspiring natural process is the foraging behavior of ants. Ant colony system (ACS), a particular instance of ant colony optimization, has recently been shown <ref> (Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997) </ref> to be competitive with other metaheuristics on the symmetric and asymmetric traveling salesman problems. Although this is an interesting and promising result, it remains clear that ant colony optimization, as well as other metaheuristics, in many cases cannot compete with specialized local search methods. <p> It therefore becomes interesting to find good metaheuristic-local optimizer couplings, where a coupling is good if the metaheuristic generates initial solutions that can be carried to very good local optima by the local optimizer. In previous work <ref> (Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997) </ref> we have shown that by coupling ACS with an extended version of the 3-opt local search procedure it is possible to o btain high-quality solutions for both symmetric and asymmetric TSPs. <p> Also, we have recently applied HAS-QAP, an ant colony algorithm coupled with a simple form of local search, to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP).

In addition, we test and compare different methods to select nodes during the search and different stopping criteria. <p> Conclusions Ant colony optimization 2 is a recent approach to distributed combinatorial optimization.

In fact, it does not require, as is the case of Savelsbergs labeling procedure <ref> (Savelsbergh, 1990) </ref>, to keep valid labeling information walking through the sequence from one h to the next: a new labeling is started as soon as a new h is chosen; this allows for selecting h in any sequence position without introducing additional computational costs.
