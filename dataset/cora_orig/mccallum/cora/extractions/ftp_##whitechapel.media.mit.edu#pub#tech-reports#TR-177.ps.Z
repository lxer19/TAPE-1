Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 177 Appeared: IEEE ICASSP, San Francisco, March 1992, vol. III, pp.45-48. Abstract Gibbs random field (GRF) models work well for synthesizing complex natural-looking image data with a small number of parameters; however, estimation methods for these parameters have a lot of problems. This paper addresses the analysis problem in a new way by examining the role of the temperature parameter of the Gibbs distribution. Studies of the model energy with respect to the temperature are used to indicate pattern equilibrium and regions of different behavior, analogous to the existence of distinct phases in a physical system. The results on equilibrium and regions of different "phases" are offered as explanations for some of the peculiar behavior of current estimation algorithms.

The homogeneous auto-binomial energy is E (x) = s2S ffx s + r2N s ! where the model parameters are ff, the external field, and fi r , the bonding interactions.

Thus, we propose that the first problem with the way estimation methods have been evaluated has to do with a lack of attention to the pattern's equilibrium.

We also know that the co-occurrence matrices will develop structure that indicates which configurations occur with zero probability [10].

The co-occurrences also determine the energy, which in turn determines the temperature. For n &gt; 2 the lack of certain configurations actually becomes helpful for determining fi=T .
