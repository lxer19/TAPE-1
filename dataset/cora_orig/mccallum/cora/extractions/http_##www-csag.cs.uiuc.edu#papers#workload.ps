Reference-contexts: Loads with constant network population emulate architectures or applications which are request limited. For example, a source node may support only k outstanding messages, or an application may only have enough concurrency to generate k messages before obtaining a response. Typical usage of synthetic workloads can be found in <ref> [5, 1, 13, 2] </ref>. Considering a range of message sizes is important because shared-virtual memory, input/output, and even messaging layer protocols give rise to messages of different sizes. Because most parallel 2 machines incorporate some type of wormhole or cut-through routing, these variable-sized packets will be visible to the network.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, the increasing use of massively-parallel systems has dramatically changed the situation for parallel interconnect workloads. With several major vendors of massively-parallel systems and many large installations, there is at last a significant base of parallel application programs <ref> [3] </ref>. While the usage of these systems is still in rapid flux, clearly identifiable uses and performance requirements for parallel interconnects have emerged. Such information presents an opportunity for the community to improve the workloads used to evaluate candidate interconnect architectures.

Reference-contexts: Some experiments with bimodal traffic can be found in [9, 10, 12]. Natural Workloads such as captured message traffic (traces) or even actual message traffic (emulation) are the most realistic source of communication workloads. Studies such as <ref> [7, 4] </ref> have produced application level traces and communication traffic characterization which can be used to drive parallel interconnect simulations.

Reference-contexts: There are several basic approaches to modeling: analytic, queueing, and simulation. In general, analytic and queueing models are of limited use because of the complexity of the routers involved and the close correlation of activities in network queues due to cut-through and wormhole activity. Typical commercial interconnects <ref> [8, 6, 19] </ref> are difficult to characterize analytically using queueing models unless major simplifications and approximations are introduced [11]. Unfortunately, in many cases, these simplifications eliminate the critical performance characteristics. Consequently, simulation remains the major tool for evaluating parallel interconnects.

Reference-contexts: However, even in cases where all traffic is packetized, the correlation of traffic produced by the "longer messages" can be an important performance factor. We believe that bimodal distributions of message sizes are a realistic model of traffic. Some experiments with bimodal traffic can be found in <ref> [9, 10, 12] </ref>.

While simulation facilitates rapid evaluation of alternatives, the absence of parallel systems means that the workloads used are an approximation of actual usage.

Reference-contexts: Commonly used destination distributions include random, hot spot with background traffic, and localized traffic. Traffic with hot spots generates "destination contention", a commonly observed effect when multiple nodes try to access the same destination. Destination hot-spots can incur extremely poor performance, even worse than with so-called "worst case" permutations <ref> [17] </ref>. Localized traffic models programs in which the communication has been highly optimized to enhance locality. This is common in many explicit message passing codes for simulation of physical systems.

Reference-contexts: Studies such as [7, 4] have produced application level traces and communication traffic characterization which can be used to drive parallel interconnect simulations. Even better, the HNET project <ref> [18] </ref> developed a machine with a reprogrammable interconnect; it is possible to actually run the application with different interconnects to evaluate the interconnect architectures in real time with an application program.
