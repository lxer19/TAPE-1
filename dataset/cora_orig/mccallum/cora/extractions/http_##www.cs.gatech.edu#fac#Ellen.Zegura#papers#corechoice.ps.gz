Abstract: Multicast routing is an important topic of both theoretical and practical interest. Several recently-proposed multicast routing algorithms involve the designation of one or more network nodes as the "center" of the routing tree for each multicast group. The choice of this designated router (which we refer to as the "core") influences the shape of the multicast routing tree, and thus influences performance of the routing scheme. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the choice of core and three performance measures. Specifically, we compare various methods of selecting a core with respect to their effect on bandwidth, delay, and traffic concentration. We conclude that simple methods are adequate for widely distributed groups, but that the addition of group information can be leveraged to improve performance especially when the group is small or exhibits a high degree of locality. We also conclude that core choice can be used to control traffic concentration, in fact traffic concentration effects can be ameliorated by appropriate core choice policies.

Reference-contexts: We analyze the performance of various methods on multicast instances, and use the results to give recommendations on core choice method. For more information on methods and results, see the full version of this paper <ref> [2] </ref>. Previous work considering the relationship between core choice and performance has focused primarily on worst case bounds [6] and performance with an optimal choice of core [7, 8]. <p> The neighborhoods represent routing domains or autonomous systems, in which groups of routers under the same administration are connected via local networks and other links. For more detail on the graph generation method, see <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Multicast Routing Scenarios To evaluate the effect of core choice methods, we consider instances of three different types or scenarios, reflecting different distributions and numbers of sources and receivers.

Reference-contexts: The average is taken over 10 different graphs of 400 nodes each. Among other advantages, this allows direct comparison of the effect of core choice on the different performance measures. Further, shortest-path trees are constructed by the current Internet multi-cast routing approach, dvmrp <ref> [5] </ref>, thus they make a practical point of comparison.
