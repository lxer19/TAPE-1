Reference-contexts: In particular, extreme surface roughness can cause objects to produce silhouette images devoid of shading, precluding visual perception of object shape. Painters and sculptors are known to exploit their instinct for the interaction between light and materials <ref> [1, 2] </ref> to convey compelling shape cues to the observer [3]. Reflection of light by materials may be viewed as the first fundamental process in visual perception by human or machine. All reflectance mechanisms can be broadly classified into two categories: surface and body.

Reference-contexts: In surface reflection, light rays are reflected at the interface between the surface medium and air. For very smooth surfaces, this results in specular or mirror-like appearance, the viewed surface producing a clear virtual image of its surroundings that is geometrically distorted when the surface is not planar <ref> [4] </ref>. As the surface gets rougher, the virtual image begins to blur, altering surface appearance from shiny to glossy, and even diffuse for high roughness values. Surface reflection is common, for instance, in metals.

Reference-contexts: In many natural materials however, both surface and body mechanisms coexist and together determine final visual appearance. Mathematical models for both reflection mechanisms, based on physical and geometrical optics, have been studied extensively. For body reflection, numerous models have been suggested for the scattering process <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. Among these, Lambert's law [5], proposed in 1760, remains the most widely used in visual psychophysics [8], computational vision [9], remote sensing [10], and computer graphics [11]. <p> Mathematical models for both reflection mechanisms, based on physical and geometrical optics, have been studied extensively.

Lambert's law predicts strong shading and drives brightness at the occluding boundaries to zero.

Reference-contexts: In the presence of interreflections, a surface continues to behave exactly like a Lambertian one without interreflections but with a different set of normals and albedo values <ref> [15] </ref>. Alas, our visual world limits the scope of Lambert's model. While it does well in describing sub-surface scattering in a large variety of materials, it fails to describe the ubiquitous interplay between surface undulations and image resolution (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Photoreceptors of the retina and pixels in a video camera are both by necessity finite-area detectors; light intensity can be recorded only by counting photons collected in buckets of measurable size. This finite resolution, along with the optical point spread <ref> [16] </ref> inherent to any imaging system, cause each receptor to receive light not from a single point but rather from a surface area in the scene, this area increasing as the square of the distance of the surface from the eye or the camera (Figure 1b). <p> Lambert's law predicts strong shading and drives brightness at the occluding boundaries to zero. While it predicts the reflectance of several natural surfaces with adequate accuracy, it fails to capture the interplay between macroscopic surface roughness and sensor resolution. (b) Retina of the human eye <ref> [16] </ref> and solid-state sensors in video cameras have finite-size receptors that aggregate brightness from areas rather than points in the scene. The area projected onto a single receptor increases as square of surface distance from the sensor.

Reference-contexts: This isotropic surface model has been previously used to study surface reflection from rough surfaces <ref> [25] </ref>, and is invoked here to achieve mathematical tractability 2 . When = 0, all facet normals align with the mean surface normal, producing a planar patch that obeys Lambert's law. <p> increase in brightness is observed as the sensor moves towards the illuminant; this backscattering is in contrast to Lambertian behavior where brightness is constant and independent of sensor direction, and also in contrast to surface reflection where a peak in brightness is expected in the vicinity of the specular direction <ref> [25] </ref>. <p> The scope of the proposed model is broadened by combining it [26] with previously suggested ones for surface reflection <ref> [25] </ref> that are based on similar roughness assumptions.

Reference-contexts: pertinent radiometric and geometric phenomena and hence results in a reflectance model that performs fairly well for a large variety of real surfaces. 3 The reflection model captures not only the foreshortening of individual facets (Figure 2a), but also masking, shadowing, and interreflections (up to two bounces) between adjacent facets <ref> [26] </ref>. The brightness of a surface patch is expressed as the integral of facet brightness over all facet normals. This integral is cumbersome to evaluate and must be broken into components representing facets that are masked, shadowed, masked and shadowed, and neither masked nor shadowed. <p> A solution to the integral was arrived at by first deriving a basis function for each component of the integral, and then finding coefficients for the bases through extensive numerical simulations <ref> [26] </ref>. The accuracy of the model was verified by matching model predictions with reflectance measurements from natural surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, and clay (Figure 3). In all cases, predicted and measured data were found to be in strong agreement. <p> The developed model may be viewed as a generalization of Lambert's law, which is simply an extreme case with = 0. The model has direct implications for shape recovery in machine vision <ref> [26] </ref> and for realistic rendering in computer graphics [28]. Further, it provides 4 a firm basis for studying visual perception of three-dimensional objects. <p> Surface brightness increases as the sensor approaches source direction, violating Lambert's law that predicts brightness to be independent of viewing direction. This brightness increase is also in contrast to surface reflection mechanisms that produce peaks around the specular direction. In these and other experiments <ref> [26] </ref>, the proposed model is found to be in strong agreement with measured data. The narrow peak observed in the source direction is attributed to the opposition effect [27]. <p> The scope of the proposed model is broadened by combining it <ref> [26] </ref> with previously suggested ones for surface reflection [25] that are based on similar roughness assumptions.

Reference-contexts: In these and other experiments [26], the proposed model is found to be in strong agreement with measured data. The narrow peak observed in the source direction is attributed to the opposition effect <ref> [27] </ref>. This phenomenon is of relatively less import to visual perception as it requires the observer and the source to be within a few degrees from each other, a situation difficult to emulate in practice without either one obstructing the other.
