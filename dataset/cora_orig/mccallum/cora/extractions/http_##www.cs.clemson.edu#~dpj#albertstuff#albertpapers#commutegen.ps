Abstract: We give a simple characterization for a nonassociative algebra A, having characteristic 6= 2, to be commutative. Namely, A is commutative if and only if it is flexible with a commuting set of generators. A counterexample shows that characteristic 6= 2 is necessary. Both the characterization and the counterexample were discovered using the computer algebra system in [2]. Key words: commutative, flexible, nonassociative algebra.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, an interactive computer program for building nonassociative algebras was developed <ref> [2] </ref>. With this system, the user specifies the generators and the identities that the algebra is to satisfy, as well as the underlying field of scalars. <p> Thus A is power associative. 2 3 Counterexample We now give an example showing that the characteristic restriction in Theorem 1 is necessary. It is further noteworthy that this example, too, was constructed with the help of the same computer algebra program in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An algebra is called flexible if it satisfies the identity (x; y; x) = 0: (1) fl This research was partially supported by NSF Grant #CCR8905534. 1 Flexible algebras have been well-studied (see <ref> [3] </ref> for references). Obviously (1) is satisfied by any associative algebra.
