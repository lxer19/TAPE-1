Abstract: We present a single identity for the variety of all lattices that is much simpler than those previously known to us. We also show that the variety of weakly associative lattices is one-based, and we present a generalized one-based theorem for subvarieties of weakly associative lattices that can be defined with absorption laws. The automated theorem-proving program Otter was used in a substantial way to obtain the results.

Reference-contexts: We then show that every finitely based subvariety of WAL that is definable by absorption laws is also one-based. 7 3.1 WAL is One-based We take as our starting point the following basis for WAL <ref> [1] </ref>. x ^ x = x, x _ x = x, (W1,W1 0 ) ((x _ z) ^ (y _ z)) ^ z = z, ((x ^ z) _ (y ^ z)) _ z = z, (W3,W3 0 ) Clearly, (W4) follows from (W1) and (W3), and dually, (W4 0 )

Reference-contexts: To find a single identity for gWAL, we must embed the additional absorption law into a single identity for WAL. The idea of embedding a unary function inside an identity goes back to G. Higman and B. H. Neumann (see <ref> [4] </ref> where they prove that every finitely based variety of group theory is one-based). Such a technique was first applied to lattices by Padmanabhan in [8]. Theorem 3 The variety gWAL is one-based. Proof.

Reference-contexts: [9], along with McKenzie's absorption basis above, yields a single identity with just seven variables; however, written without abbreviation, it has length 355 (where length is the count of symbols, including variables, "^", "_", and "=", but not parentheses). 2.1 A Simpler Absorption Basis for Lattice Theory The program MACE <ref> [5] </ref>, which searches for models and counterexamples, was used to show that McKenzie's absorption basis (1)-(4) is independent. The automated theorem-proving program Otter [6] was then used to examine variants of (1)-(4) in which terms are commuted.

Reference-contexts: Second, we show that the theory of weakly associative lattices is one-based and that every subvariety of weakly associative lattices that is definable with absorption laws is one-based. The automated theorem-proving program Otter <ref> [6] </ref> was used in a substantial way to obtain the results in this paper, and we present some of the proofs found by Otter. Because the practical use of automated theorem proving is new and not widely known, we also indicate how Otter was used. <p> The automated theorem-proving program Otter <ref> [6] </ref> was then used to examine variants of (1)-(4) in which terms are commuted.

Reference-contexts: It is known that every finitely based variety of lattices is two-based and that it is one-based iff it is either the variety of all lattices or else the trivial variety of one-element lattices defined by x = y (cf. <ref> [7] </ref> and [8]). This paper has two parts. First, we improve several results on the variety of all lattices. <p> If a lattice variety is one based, it must be definable by a single absorption law, and as a prelude, we must have a basis consisting entirely of absorption identities. The simplest previously known absorption basis for lattice theory (in terms of ^ and _) was McKenzie's <ref> [7] </ref>, consisting of the four identities y _ (x ^ (y ^ z)) = y; (1) ((x ^ y) _ (y ^ z)) _ y = y; (3) McKenzie first constructed a single identity, containing 34 variables, for lattice theory [7]; then G. <p> lattice theory (in terms of ^ and _) was McKenzie's <ref> [7] </ref>, consisting of the four identities y _ (x ^ (y ^ z)) = y; (1) ((x ^ y) _ (y ^ z)) _ y = y; (3) McKenzie first constructed a single identity, containing 34 variables, for lattice theory [7]; then G. Gratzer asked for a short identity defining lattices [2]. <p> = x ^ (y ^ z): The dual argument (after transitivity of "") holds for associativity of "_". 11 (Lemma 5 was also proved by Otter, but that proof is too complex to present here.) Therefore, as a corollary to Theorem 3, we have that lattice theory is one-based (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>, [9], and Sec. 2). 4 Open Questions 1. Are there single identities for lattice theory, WAL, or gWAL simpler than the ones presented here (16, 19, 20)? 2.

Reference-contexts: Gratzer asked for a short identity defining lattices [2]. Padmanabhan's reduction schema <ref> [9] </ref>, along with McKenzie's absorption basis above, yields a single identity with just seven variables; however, written without abbreviation, it has length 355 (where length is the count of symbols, including variables, "^", "_", and "=", but not parentheses). 2.1 A Simpler Absorption Basis for Lattice Theory The program MACE [5], <p> [39 ! 3] 106,105 ((x _ y) ^ (y _ z)) ^ y = y [55 ! 7] 677 x _ (y ^ (x ^ z)) = x [29 ! 224 :30] Line 106 is (4), and line 677 is (1). 2.2 A New Reduction Schema Padmanabhan's reduction schema in <ref> [9] </ref> is p (p (x; y; y); u; p (p (x; y; y); f (y); z)) = y; (6) where p is a majority polynomial. <p> (y; y; x) = y; p (y; x; y) = y; p (x; y; y) = y; f (y) = yg: (7) (To build a single identity for a theory satisfying a majority polynomial and axiomatized with an absorption basis, say of size n, one can apply the lemma in <ref> [9] </ref> n 1 times, then substitute the result in the reduction schema.) Lemma 2 The identity p (p (x; y; y); p (x; p (y; z; f (y)); g (y)); u) = y (8) is equivalent to the set fp (y; y; x) = y; p (y; x; y) = y; <p> The reduction schema (8) was found by automatically generating candidate schemas with Otter, then with each, searching with Otter for a proof of the preceding type. With the new reduction schema, because we have f (y) = y and g (y) = y, we apply the lemma of <ref> [9] </ref> n 2 times instead of n 1 times. With the new lattice theory absorption basis of size n = 3, instead of n = 4, we can build a single identity with just one application of the lemma. <p> Proof. With (14) and (15), we need not apply the lemma in <ref> [9] </ref> to build a single identity. With the reduction schema (8) we can simply substitute (14) and (15) for f (y) and g (y). <p> Using the lemma in <ref> [9] </ref>, we bundle the identities (17) and (18) as p (W 1 (y); W 2 (y); x), and substitute this for f (y); we keep g (y) as a place holder for the further 10 absorption law g (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x n ) = x 1 <p> Note the two occurrences of g (y), which represent the further absorption law. If a further set of absorption laws, instead of a single law, is added, the set can be bundled, as above, with applications of the lemma in <ref> [9] </ref>. The theory of all lattices may be viewed as a weakly associative lattice satisfying the additional absorption law x ^ (y _ (x _ z)) = x: (21) Lemma 5 fWAL, (21)g ) fthe two associative laws for ^ and _g. Proof. <p> x ^ (y ^ z): The dual argument (after transitivity of "") holds for associativity of "_". 11 (Lemma 5 was also proved by Otter, but that proof is too complex to present here.) Therefore, as a corollary to Theorem 3, we have that lattice theory is one-based (cf. [7], <ref> [9] </ref>, and Sec. 2). 4 Open Questions 1.
