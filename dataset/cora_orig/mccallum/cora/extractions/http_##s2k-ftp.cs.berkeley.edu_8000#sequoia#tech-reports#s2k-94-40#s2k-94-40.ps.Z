Title: Database Management for Data Visualization  
Author: Peter Kochevar 
Address: La Jolla, CA  
Affiliation: DEC/San Diego Supercomputer Center  
Abstract: Visualization management systems which integrate database management, data visualization, and graphical user-interface generation into one package are becoming essential tools for conducting science. Unfortunately, the link between data management and data visualization is not very well understood. To make matters worse, most database management systems available today are not well-suited for handling large, time-sequenced data sets that are common to many scientific disciplines. The reason for this shortfall is that most database systems do not use an appropriate data model, are not geared toward real-time operation, and they have inadequate user-interfaces. Hints as to how database systems can fix these problems are given so that effective visualization management systems can be constructed.

Reference-contexts: Such data objects would be used just like any traditional data object in a program except that their storage resides in a database managed by a DBMS. The ODE system from AT&T is one such DBMS which uses an extension of C++ as its interaction language <ref> [1] </ref>. 5 Conclusion Computation is an integral part of conducting science today. As a result many scientific disciplines, particularly the Earth sciences, are awash in data that must be managed. Unfortunately, database management systems currently available are inadequate for handling most forms of scientific data.

Reference-contexts: But, the idea of the relation is too ackward a concept to adequately deal with a large variety of scientific data particularly when topological relationships exist between data elements. For scientific data, the notion of the fiber bundle <ref> [3, 4, 7] </ref> is more appropriate as a basis for a data model than most other theoretical concepts. Fiber bundles contain the notion of the relation as a proper subset yet they are quite rich in their expressibility of varied data structures.

Reference-contexts: As a user navigates through a virtual environment representing data, level-of-detail swapping should occur automatically and seamlessly as data objects loom up and recede within a user's field of view <ref> [6] </ref>. In this regard, a visualization management system acts much like a flight simulator. At the heart of this simulator is the DBMS which must be able to support the access to varied levels-of-detail.

Reference-contexts: This idea should also hold not only for data sets that are used frequently and are familiar to a user, but also for data sets that are 7 completely unfamiliar to them. In Kochevar et al <ref> [8] </ref>, a very simple visualization management system called the Visualization Executive is described which links the Postgres DBMS [11] with most any visualization package. The design of the Visualization Executive was intended to be somewhat analogous to that of the Apple Macintosh folder browser.
