Abstract: A new approach to tractable deduction from an expressive knowledge base is presented that approximates formulae by automatically mapping them to some restricted language. Various mappings and their properties are discussed, and an anytime algorithm to compute approximations is presented. Several published approaches prove to be special instances of ours. To illustrate this, our formalism is used to formalize hierarchical knowledge bases, and to extend them by allowing negation and mutual exclusion. We believe this to be the first comprehensive theoretical framework for approximate reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Since practical knowledge representation systems need more expressive representation languages [ Doyle and Patil, 1991 ] , this intractability of reasoning is a serious problem. Previous approaches to this problem have used tractable, but incomplete reasoning mechanisms. These mechanisms are often specified either algorithmically (c.f. <ref> [ Allen, 1983 ] </ref> ), or by using a non-standard model theory (c.f. [ Levesque, 1984a ] ), or by using an incomplete set of inference rules (c.f. [ Konolige, 1986 ] ). We present a new framework for obtaining efficient and expressive knowledge representation systems. <p> Furthermore, they do not approximate queries. There have been other approaches to the problem of the intractability of reasoning, in various other contexts. Some of them ( [ Levesque, 1984b ] , <ref> [ Allen, 1983 ] </ref> , etc.) are special cases of the generalization of this framework presented in [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] . 8 Conclusions We presented a framework for approximate reasoning using a limited vocabulary, and showed that it improves on many previous approaches, as well as facilitating the

Reference-contexts: These two, taken together, can provide approximate, but tractable, upper and lower bounds on the results of exact, but intractable, sound and complete reasoning. 1 Furthermore, these bounds can be refined by changing the vocabulary. We present an anytime algorithm <ref> [ Boddy and Dean, 1988 ] </ref> that computes upper and lower bound approximations. The algorithm successively refines approximations, and can be stopped prematurely and yet yield meaningful answers. We show that it is guaranteed to provide better approximations after each refinement step.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm successively refines approximations, and can be stopped prematurely and yet yield meaningful answers. We show that it is guaranteed to provide better approximations after each refinement step. Our approach is motivated by the Hierarchical Knowledge Bases (HKB) framework <ref> [ Borgida and Etherington, 1989 ] </ref> , where the representation of input knowledge (expressed in a restricted subset of first-order logic) is restricted to instances of elements of a pre-specified hierarchy of so-called "natural" disjunctions. <p> reptile carnivore mammal fish fish eater rodent eater flesh eating mammal rodent turtle snake cat ferret dog mouse gerbil hamster goldfish guppy complete lattice of possible disjunctions), it is possible to improve the time complexity of representation and query-answering from linear to logarithmic in the size of the knowledge base <ref> [ Borgida and Etherington, 1989 ] </ref> . Our framework generalizes HKB and some other previous approaches and provides a theoretical basis for them. Results about specific formalisms then fall out as corollaries to theorems derived in the general framework. <p> Definition 1 A vocabulary, V; is any (possibly infinite) subset of L. Intuitively, the vocabulary consists of those formulae that are represented accurately. Other formulae in the language are approximated to formulae in the vocabulary, perhaps with some loss or gain of information. For example, in the HKB case <ref> [ Borgida and Etherington, 1989 ] </ref> , the vocabulary is the set of all atomic formulae whose predicates are included in the hierarchy. Any formula splits the vocabulary into three parts | the formulae that entail , the formulae entailed by , and the others. <p> We illustrate this by presenting instances of this framework that eliminate three major limitations of HKB <ref> [ Borgida and Etherington, 1989 ] </ref> , while maintaining its tractability. Other mechanisms for approximate reasoning can be similarly obtained by instantiating the framework. Recall that HKB represents information using a hierarchy of naturally-occurring disjunctions, such as that 5 shown in Figure 1. <p> Since j ds V; is always sound, it follows that lower-bound answers are sound. Also, since j dw V; is always complete, it follows that upper-bound answers are complete. Thus, the results in <ref> [ Borgida and Etherington, 1989 ] </ref> are special cases of our results.

Reference-contexts: For any formula in L, its weakening b c V; is the set fff 2 V j j= ffg ^ ; its strengthening d e V; is the set fff 2 V j ff j= g _ . 4 The set can be thought of as containing definitions (see <ref> [ Brachman and Schmolze, 1985 ] </ref> ) | a set of formulae that define the terms used in the system. For example, a "parent" can be defined as "a person who has at least one child".

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is well known that reasoning with a knowledge representation system becomes more difficult as the representation language becomes more expressive [ Levesque and Brachman, 1985 ] . Reasoning is apparently intractable even for the very weak representation language of propositional logic <ref> [ Cook, 1971 ] </ref> . Since practical knowledge representation systems need more expressive representation languages [ Doyle and Patil, 1991 ] , this intractability of reasoning is a serious problem. Previous approaches to this problem have used tractable, but incomplete reasoning mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we present an anytime algorithm to compute approximations. We show an application of our framework, extending the expressiveness of HKBs, in Section 6. Finally, we discuss some other related research. Given the limited space available here, we relegate detailed discussion and proofs of various results to <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> . 2 Vocabularies and Approximations Let L be any language that has a notion of formula 3 , and a notion of entailment, j=, which is a relation between theories and formulae. <p> This does not necessarily limit the expressiveness of L, since theories may contain many such formulae. Our framework can be extended to the case when this assumption does not hold <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> . 3 Approximating Theories The notion of approximation can be extended to theories. As in the case of formulae, the strengthening of a theory should contain exactly those formulae of the vocabulary that entail the theory. <p> In <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> , we show that the iterative weakening of a finite theory can be obtained in only a finite number of iterations. <p> Another encouraging result is that, for either insertions or deletions, both the revised strengthening and weakening can be computed incrementally, starting from the existing approximations <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> . 5 Computing Approximations We now turn to the question of computing approximations. For the purpose of this section, we assume that the vocabulary V is fixed and finite. The definitions are also assumed to be fixed. <p> Given a clausal query to a knowledge base , the lower-bound answer is true iff j ds V; . 8 Since all four kinds of weakening are identical, a theory can be weakened by weakening its formulae independently. In <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> , we show that certain special properties of the vocabulary allow tractable weakening of individual formulae. Since j ds V; is always sound, it follows that lower-bound answers are sound. <p> Since j ds V; is always sound, it follows that lower-bound answers are sound. Also, since j dw V; is always complete, it follows that upper-bound answers are complete. Thus, the results in [ Borgida and Etherington, 1989 ] are special cases of our results. In <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> , we show new instances of our framework that avoid three major limitations of HKB, while maintaining its asymptotic tractability: Negation: We allow representation of, and reasoning with, limited forms of negative information. <p> In <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> , we show that both abstractions are special cases of our framework. Moreover, a new notion of abstraction can be developed using the ideas we have outlined. <p> Furthermore, they do not approximate queries. There have been other approaches to the problem of the intractability of reasoning, in various other contexts. Some of them ( [ Levesque, 1984b ] , [ Allen, 1983 ] , etc.) are special cases of the generalization of this framework presented in <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> . 8 Conclusions We presented a framework for approximate reasoning using a limited vocabulary, and showed that it improves on many previous approaches, as well as facilitating the development of specific tractable reasoning techniques. <p> We believe this is the first comprehensive theoretical framework for approximate reasoning. We presented an anytime algorithm that, for finite vocabularies, computes weakenings and strengthenings of formulae. These approximations can be used to determine whether a theory approximately-entails a formula. In <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> , we extend our treatment to infinite vocabularies, where approximate entailment is determined without explicitly computing entire approximations. <p> One limitation of this framework is the assumption that the j= tests between pairs of individual formulae, taken one from the language and the other from the vocabulary, are tractable. In general, these tests may be intractable for complex formulae. We have generalized the framework presented here <ref> [ Dalal and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> . In the generalized version, the approximation of a formula is obtained by combining the approximations of its sub-formulae, which can reduce the complexity significantly.
