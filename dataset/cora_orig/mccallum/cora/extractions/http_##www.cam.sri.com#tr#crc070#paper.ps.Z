Abstract: In this paper we describe how the translation methodology adopted for the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) addresses the characteristics of the speech translation task in a context where it is essential to achieve easy customization to new languages and new domains. We then discuss the issues that arise in any attempt to evaluate a speech translator, and present the results of such an evaluation carried out on SLT for several language pairs.

Reference-contexts: given language are the grammar, the function word lexicon, and the macros defining common content word behaviours (count noun, transitive verb, etc). 1 E.g. in our initial extension from English to languages with more complicated morphology, which necessitated the development of a morphological processor based on the two-level formalism (see <ref> (Carter, 1995) </ref>). These are defined using explicit feature-value equations which must be written by a skilled grammarian. For a given language pair, the more complex transfer rules, which tend to be for function words and other commonly-occurring, idiosyncratic words, can also involve arbitrarily large, recursive structures. <p> Once a user has become accustomed to the system, around two hundred sentences per hour may be processed in this way. This, together with the use of representative subcorpora <ref> (Rayner, Bouillon and Carter, 1995) </ref> to allow structurally equivalent sentences to be represented by a single example, means that a corpus of many thousands of sentences can be judged in just a few person weeks.

We then discuss the evaluation of speech translation systems. <p> an order of magnitude less than the effort required for the original grammar (Gamback and Rayner, 1992; Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1996; Rayner, Carter et al, 1997). (3) The statistical information used in analysis is entirely derived from the results of supervised training on corpora carried out using the TreeBanker <ref> (Carter, 1997) </ref>, a graphical tool that presents a nonexpert user with a display of the salient differences between alternative analyses in order that the correct one may be identified. Once a user has become accustomed to the system, around two hundred sentences per hour may be processed in this way. <p> See (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) and <ref> (Carter, 1997) </ref> for details. A similar mechanism has been developed to allow users to specify appropriate translations, giving rise to preferences on outcomes of the transfer process. <p> In the current version of SLT, transfer rules were written directly for neighbouring languages in the sequence Spanish French- English - Swedish - Danish (most of these neighbours being relatively closely related), with other pairs being derived by transfer composition. Further details can be found in <ref> (Rayner, Carter et al, 1997) </ref>. 5 Evaluation of speech translation systems: methodological issues There is still no real consensus on how to evaluate speech translation systems. The most common approach is some version of the following.

Good demonstration versions exist for the four pairs English ! Swedish, English ! French, Swedish ! English and Swedish ! Danish.
