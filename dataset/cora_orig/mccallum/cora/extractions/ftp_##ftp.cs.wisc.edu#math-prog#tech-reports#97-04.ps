Abstract: The problem of vehicle guidance in a network with failures is considered. The network may be in one of finitely many states characterized by different travel times along the arcs, and transitions between the states occur according to a continuos-time Markov chain. The objective is to guide the vehicles in a manner minimizing the total expected travel time. Dynamic programming models and flow-oriented models are developed and analyzed in the uncapacitated and the ca-pacitated case. It is shown that the robust plan can be found from a special two-stage stochastic programming problem in which the second stage problem describes the re-routing of vehicles that experienced state transition during their travel. The models are illustrated on an example of the Sioux Falls transportation network. The computational results reveal striking properties of different guidance policies and show that substantial improvements in both duration and size of traffic jams can be achieved by employing robust guidance strategies.

Reference-contexts: Related problem formulations have been studied by many authors. In [5,6,15] stochastic shortest path problems are analyzed; they correspond to our setting when no arc capacity constraints are present. In <ref> [3] </ref> related two-stage problems are considered in the case when some arc lengths may become infinite. Problems with capacity constraints are discussed in [11] in the case of a dynamic (layered) network with one source (see also [16] and references therein).

Reference-contexts: Owing to the Markov property of state transitions and to the linearity of the costs, the problem can be solved by dynamic programming methods as the stochastic shortest path problem <ref> [5] </ref>. With each node i 2 N and each state ` 2 f0; 1; : : : ; Lg we associate the cost-to-go v ` i : the least expected travel time from i to D when the initial network state is `. <p> The expected total travel cost is equal to P n . We shall call the solution thus obtained a one-step lookahead policy (see <ref> [5] </ref>). If the initial state of the network is ` 6= 0 when a vehicle starts its journey, the one step lookahead policy is given by a similar approximation: we set all ` = 0, ` 6= 0, in (2.2), but consider (2.3) in its full form.

Reference-contexts: It is similar to the deterministic flow problem, only the costs are modified in a manner analogous to (4.6)-(4.8). 10 Decomposition Another approach, especially useful when the full linear programming formulation is very large, is to apply special decomposition methods developed for two-stage stochastic pro gramming problems <ref> [18] </ref>. These methods work with the compact formulation (9.1)-(9.3) and use objective and feasibility cuts for Q ` , ` = 1; : : : ; L, to construct sufficiently good models of (9.1). <p> The domain of Q ` () is a convex closed polyhedron. Although defined in an implicit way, it can be reconstructed by using so-called feasibility cuts: linear inequalities defining dom Q ` . There are many ways to construct feasibility cuts <ref> [18] </ref>; one which is relatively simple has the following form. <p> Thus the master problem (10.4) has a convex and piecewise-linear objective, and it can be solved by linear programming methods. Advanced techniques, involving regularization and selection of active cuts and `critical scenarios' are available, too (see <ref> [18] </ref>). 11 Computational Results We have investigated the effects of our modeling format on a simple example using the Sioux Falls network, that appeared in [10].

Reference-contexts: Problem (9.1)-(9.3) is similar to two-stage stochastic programming problems (see [12,17,21] and the references therein). Much is known about these problems, and efficient solution techniques exist that exploit the structure of the model in question (see <ref> [21] </ref> and the references therein). We summarize below the facts that are relevant for our case.
