Reference-contexts: While the Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm is complex, it is a "classic in computational graph theory" and "a superb example of the design of an efficient graph algorithm" <ref> [1] </ref>. We are studying this algorithm precisely for this reason. I am aware of two textbooks [3, 7] that describe the algorithm. The problem of graph planarity is intriguing because it connects a discrete structure (the graph) to a continuous structure (the plane).

Reference-contexts: It is not important to know what the terms in the theorems mean exactly, or the details of the proofs (which you can find in Deo <ref> [2] </ref>). The point to note is that these proofs either are nonconstructive or do not lead to efficient ways to test planarity. For instance, enumerating all subgraphs suggested by Kuratowski's Theorem would require (V 6 ) time.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 6 (Fary) Any planar graph can be embedded in the plane such that every edge is drawn as a straight line segment. Proof: The proof is involved and does not contribute much to the understanding of planarity. If you are interested, see the original paper <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 Let's see how we can preprocess the input graph to simplify it. First, we note that the direction of edges does not affect the existence of a planar embedding, so, without loss of generality, we can assume that the graph is undirected.

Reference-contexts: Proof: The proof is extremely difficult and may be found in textbooks on topology, such as Hall and Spencer <ref> [5] </ref>. The theorem seems geometrically evident for simple closed curves like circles or polygons, but it is not apparent for more general curves. We will accept the theorem without proof. 2 The following lemma is a corollary of the Jordan Curve Theorem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In these two lectures, we will discuss the algorithm developed by Hopcroft and Tarjan <ref> [6] </ref> for efficiently testing whether a graph G = (V; E) is planar.
