Reference-contexts: The optimal problem solution was obtained by exhaustive search in a substantially con-strainted space of admissible solutions. 2 The scheduling problem The scheduling problem described in <ref> [1, 2] </ref> is concerned with optimizing energy consumption in a production unit of a textile factory. The problem can be divided into two parts. First, there are work environment constraints that determine the admissible schedule solutions.

Reference-contexts: A consumption greater than this available amount of energy is the cost of a schedule which has to be minimized. 3 Solving the scheduling problem with CLP The scheduling problem is formulated and solved in the CLP system ECL i PS e <ref> [3] </ref> and executed on the workstation Sun Sparc 10. In our problem we have complex relationships that can be represented in a simple way in CLP.

Reference-contexts: The time used for this addi-tional computing is usually insignificant in comparison to the time saved by searching the reduced search space. The variable selection order also greatly influences the reduction of the search space. All such and similar techniques <ref> [4] </ref> try to prevent inconsistency which would come out in later steps of the solution construction.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the time when cost is taken into account, the reduction of the search space will be more or less successful <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. 3.4.1 Description of the intelligent enumera tion method The intelligent enumeration method uses the depth-first search strategy. The idea is based on the evaluation of a cost function after each step of the solution construction.
