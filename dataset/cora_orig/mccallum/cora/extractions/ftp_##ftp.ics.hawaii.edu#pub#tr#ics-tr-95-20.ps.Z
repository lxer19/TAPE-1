Abstract: This paper overviews a study that assessed the strengths and weaknesses of a computer-based approach to improving the sense of community within one organization, the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. The case study used a pretest-posttest design. First, several measures of the sense of community within the department were obtained via a questionnaire. Second, a World Wide Web information system was introduced in an effort to affect the level of community within the department. Third, a similar questionnaire was administered after a period of four months. Analysis of the survey responses and system logs showed that the information system designed to promote community had instead polarized some of its members. In addition, the system served as a valuable diagnostic tool for discovering what factors may help promote or inhibit community building.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The sense of community in an organization is not a binary entity. One cannot say that it either exists or it does not. As with many other difficult to measure concepts, community exists in varying degrees. Clark <ref> [1] </ref> defines community as a sentiment which people have about themselves in relation to others and others in relation to themselves;...there are two essentials for the existence of community: a sense of significance and a sense of solidarity.

Reference-contexts: Pretest and post-test questionnaires were administered to the organization to assess the sense of community. Logfiles kept by the information system were analyzed to evaluate how the system was actually used. This system is similar to several others, Edunet [3], the Well <ref> [2] </ref>, and the Davis Community Network (http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/). Overall, department members did feel a sense of importance and belonging, and had a good sense of collective self-awareness.
