Abstract: Configuring routers to realize various policies is a difficult task. We classify the typical Internet routing policies and present a specification language where these policies can be specified at high level. We also present a tool that analyses the policies specified in this language and generates the low level router configurations.

Reference-contexts: For example, whenever a customer AS registers new route objects, the router configurations of the customer AS as well as its provider ASes (and perhaps other ASes) are updated automatically. In a way, ASes share the router configuration tasks of each other to achieve scalable router configurations. RtConfig <ref> [1] </ref> is the first tool which can automatically generate complete router policy configurations from an higher level policy specification. rlc [4] (route list compiler) is another effort at configuring routers. It is cisco specific and can only generate access lists, a small piece of the router configuration task.

Reference-contexts: Or it may use both providers simultaneously for load balancing. Note that the customer does not allow B and C to reach each other over its network. 3 Routing Policy Specification Lan guage (RPSL) RPSL is based on an earlier policy language known as RIPE-181 <ref> [3] </ref>. Many of the policies exercised today can not be expressed in RIPE-181. For example, it is not possible to specify policies of Figures 7 and 9. In RPSL (and in RIPE-181), the policies are specified in policy objects.

Reference-contexts: This imposes policy constraints on the inter-AS traffic. For example, an AS may only allow traffic from certain ASes to use its resources, or may prefer to use the resources of a particular AS over other ASes. These policies are realized by the inter-AS routing protocol, BGP <ref> [5] </ref>, and need to be configured in the routers. This task is both tedious and not straightforward. First, each AS has a large number of routers that need to be configured. Second, these configurations can be very large (of the order of hundreds of thousands of lines).
