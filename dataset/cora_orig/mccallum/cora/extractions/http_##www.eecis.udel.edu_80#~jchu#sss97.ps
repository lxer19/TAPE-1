Abstract: In naturally-occurring collaborative dialogues, the participants often share the responsibility of taking initiative in the dialogue. Thus, in order for a system to interact with human agents in a natural and coherent fashion, it must be able to recognize and provide cues when shifts in initiative are intended, and to take initiative into account in interpreting user utterances and in generating responses to such utterances. In this paper, we argue that it is necessary to distinguish between task initiative, which indicates the agent who is currently actively involved in planning toward accomplishing the agents' task, and dialogue initiative, which indicates the agent who has the lead in determining the current discourse focus. We identify a set of cues which may indicate changes in initiative that can be inferred based on linguistic and domain knowledge alone, and show how these cues can be used to determine the distribution of task and dialogue initiatives at the end of each dialogue turn. In addition, we show that the effects of task and dialogue initiatives on the dialogue system's response generation process are twofold: they determine which subcomponents of the dialogue system may be selected to address the problem of response generation, and they affect what the selected subcomponent will include in its response to the user's utterances.

Reference-contexts: The rest of this paper discusses our model for tracking initiative and how this model affects the response generation process. Modeling Shifts in Initiative Cues for Shifts in Initiative In order to identify cues for shifts in initiative, we annotated the TRAINS 91 corpus <ref> (Gross, Allen, & Traum 1993) </ref> to indicate the agents who hold the task and dialogue initiatives in each dialogue turn. We then analyzed the annotated dialogues and identified eight types of cues that may have contributed to the shift or lack of shift in initiative during the interactions.

Reference-contexts: The second type includes cases in which the speaker's utterances do not include any new information that has not been conveyed earlier in the dialogue. We further classify these utterances into two sub-types: repetitions, a subset of the informationally redundant utterances <ref> (Walker 1992) </ref>, in which the speaker paraphrases a previous utterance by the hearer or repeats the utterance verbatim, and prompts, in which the speaker merely gives an acknowledgment for the hearer's previous utterance (s).

Reference-contexts: I would suggest that you take some other seminar course to satisfy your requirement, and sign up as a listener for NLP if you're really interested in it. Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that in <ref> (Whittaker & Stenton 1988) </ref>. In utterance (3a), A provides a direct response to S's question; thus the conversational lead remains with S. <p> Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say at the current point in the dialogue and are thus indications that the hearer should take over the initiative <ref> (Whittaker & Stenton 1988) </ref>. The third type of discourse cues includes questions which, based on anticipated responses, are further divided into domain questions and evaluation questions. Domain questions are questions in which the speaker intends to obtain or verify a piece of domain knowledge.
