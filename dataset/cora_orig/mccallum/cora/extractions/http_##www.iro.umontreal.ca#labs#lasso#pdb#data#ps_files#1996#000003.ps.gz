Abstract: This document provides detailed description of basic algorithms for MDG (Multi-way Decision Graph) operators, including disjunction, relational product and pruning-by-subsumption. There is no difficulty in verifying the soundness of the algorithms, except perhaps for the pruning algorithm, for which a proof of soundness is given in Section 5. The document is not self-containd. For basic concepts and informal descriptions of the algorithms, please refer to [1].

Reference-contexts: The top symbol of Q 1 comes after the top symbol of oe in custom order. Then recursively compute S tail = PD (oe; T ): (20) If S tail = ;, return S = ;. Otherwise return S = f <ref> [Q 1 ; 1 ] </ref>g S tail : (21) 2. The top symbol of Q 1 comes before the top symbol of oe.
