Reference-contexts: Along with increasing speeds in networks, the variety of uses to which real-time services can be put is also rising. CCITT suggests a class of conversational services for broadband networks <ref> [1] </ref> that provide for bidirectional real-time communication. Examples of applications to which these services could be put would be videotelephony, video conference, voice transfer etc.

Reference-contexts: As an example, this situation could arise in video applications. There is the notion of hierarchical source coding which implies the separation of the digitized video signal into subsignals of differing importance <ref> [2, 3] </ref>; the relatively stable background information in a picture is separated from the information pertaining to motion. The information content of a scene, in terms of bits needed to represent it, would depend on the degree of activity in the scene. <p> Further, we assume independence from slot to slot. Again, for video applications, this is difficult to justify. Usually, what is transmitted over the network is the difference in the picture from frame to frame with a regular refresh of the entire picture <ref> [2] </ref>. Hence, there is likely to be correlation from slot to slot. Thus a logical extension of the work would be to relax these independence assumptions and to carry out the analysis again.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the balancing scheme achieves performance in which the loss of each class of traffic is often strictly less than that achievable under the thresholding policy. The analytical methodology that we use derives in part from the work presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. In [4], however, attention is given to a mixture of real-time and non-real-time traffic and hence the problem of correlated time constraints is not treated. A study of scheduling with a view to investigate the effect of service time distributions is also given in [6]. <p> Moreover, the balancing scheme achieves performance in which the loss of each class of traffic is often strictly less than that achievable under the thresholding policy.

The metric of interest for non-real-time traffic was average delay, and for real-time traffic it was probability of loss. <p> Any real-time packet that does not reach its destination within the specified deadline is lost and thus the loss probability captures the performance of a particular policy for a particular class of real-time traffic. In <ref> [4] </ref>, the tradeoff between the loss probability of real-time traffic and the average delay of the non-real-time traffic was investigated.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [5] </ref>, for example, the Shortest Deadline First policy is shown to minimize message loss. The problem of choosing an appropriate scheduling discipline becomes more even complex when the packets of the different classes of traffic have correlated time constraints. As an example, this situation could arise in video applications.

A study of scheduling with a view to investigate the effect of service time distributions is also given in <ref> [6] </ref>. Here too, a mixture of real-time and non-real-time traffic is considered. In [8], an analysis is carried out of the Head-of-the Line with Priority Jumps scheduling discipline for delay sensitive traffic. Again, correlations between the different classes of traffic are not considered here.

Reference-contexts: The deadline itself is typically on an end-to-end basis and may be translated into local deadlines as well <ref> [7] </ref>. The performance metric of interest is thus packet loss and the goal of any good scheduling policy should be to minimize loss. Several classes of real-time traffic may arrive at a node.
