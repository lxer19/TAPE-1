Abstract: Emerging distributed multimedia applications have stringent performance requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, delay-jitter, and loss rate. The Tenet real-time protocol suite provides the services and mechanismsfor delivering such performance guarantees, even during periods of high network load and congestion. The protocols achieve this by using resource management, connection admission control, and appropriate packet service disciplines inside the network. The Sequoia 2000 network employs the Tenet Protocol Suite at each of its hosts and routers making it one of the first wide area packet-switched networks to provide end-to-end per-connection performance guarantees. This paper presents experiments of the Tenet protocols on the Sequoia 2000 network including measurements of the performance of the protocols, the service received by real multimedia applications using the protocols, and comparisons with the service received by applications that use the Internet protocols (UDP/IP). We conclude that the Tenet protocols successfully protect the real-time channels from other traffic in the network, including other real-time channels, and continue to meet the performance guarantees, even when the network is highly loaded.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction High speed networks are enabling the coexistence of computer data traffic with new multimedia applications. The widespread use of video and audio tools over the Internet has demonstrated the potential advantages of integrated services packet switched networks <ref> [2] </ref>. Currently, most of these applications are based on the Internet Protocol Suite [13, 12, 11], which adopts a connection-less architecture in the network layer. In the current Internet, IP routers do not discriminate between packets from different conversations, thus IP can only provide a best-effort service.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the worst case delay of a real-time packet depends not only on the real-time packet queue length, but also on the buffer size on the interface card. The admission control algorithms can take this into account by using a vacation model as described in <ref> [3, 17] </ref>. The scheduling policy successfully prevents the queueing delays from rising beyond the deadline, and also prevents buffer overflows, by ensuring that the real-time packets are served at the reserved rates.

Reference-contexts: To determine the availability of resources, each node uses the Tenet algorithms or admissions tests, which are based on the service discipline. Research by Ferrari <ref> [4] </ref> has shown that a broad spectrum of service disciplines may be used in the Tenet framework.

Reference-contexts: In the measurement, we incorporated a technique developed by David Mills and enhanced the granularity of the DECStation 5000/240 system clock to 1 microsecond by taking advantage of an undocumented 25MHz hardware register. To measure the end-to-end throughput and packet inter-arrival times we used tcpdump <ref> [8] </ref> to obtain packet traces at the destination host, and used post processing to separate the packet streams corresponding to the different streams. The qualitative assessment of the comparative video performance was based on an opinion poll.

In this paper, a measurement study evaluating the performance of the Tenet protocol suite is presented. A previous study <ref> [19] </ref> evaluated the performance of the data-delivery protocols in a local area network using synthetic workloads. <p> In the face of network congestion, Sequoia scientists require guaranteed quality of service for multimedia applications as well as best-effort services for scientific data loading applications. In <ref> [19] </ref>, the Tenet protocols have been shown to address these needs in a local testbed. Thus, the motivation of this research is to study the behavior of the Tenet protocols on the Sequoia network as a possible alternative for the needs of Sequoia scientists.
