Reference-contexts: mispredicted branch be encountered, all speculatively executed instructions and their results must be flushed, returning the processor to a known, non-speculative state for it to resume execution. 6.1 Prediction Algorithm There are several different prediction algorithms employed by these processors, but the most common is the Smith 2-bit saturating counter <ref> [1] </ref>. This method keeps track of a branch's execution history using a 2-bit saturating counter, which determines the prediction used for the next encounter of a given branch: strongly not taken, likely not taken, likely taken, and strongly taken.

Reference-contexts: The P6 chose to break from common ground and utilize the adaptive branch prediction algorithm proposed by Yeh and Patt <ref> [2] </ref>. In addition to the 2-bit saturating counter used by the Smith algorithm, a pattern history table is used to help predict more volatile branches.
