Reference-contexts: To show that our new approach is feasible, we are investigating a new service discipline called Leave-in-Time <ref> [3] </ref>. The Leave-in-Time service discipline is able to provide a session with service guarantees that are completely determined by the dynamic traffic behavior of the session.
