Abstract: Though there are now numerous examples of multimedia systems in the commercial market, these systems have been developed primarily on a case-by-case basis. The large-scale development of such systems requires a principled characterization of multimedia systems which is independent of any single application. It requires a unified query language framework to access these different structures in a variety of ways. It requires algorithms that are provably correct in processing such queries and whose efficiency can be appropriately evaluated. In this paper, we develop a framework for characterizing multimedia information systems which builds on top of the implementations of individual media, and provides a logical query language that integrates such diverse media. We develop indexing structures and algorithms to process such queries and show that these algorithms are sound and complete and relatively efficient (polynomial-time). We show that the generation of media-events (i.e. generating different states of the different media concurrently) can be viewed as a query processing problem, and that synchronization can be viewed as constraint solving. This observation allows us to introduce the notion of a media presentation as a sequence of media-events that satisfy a sequence of queries. We believe this paper represents a first step towards the development of multimedia theory.

Reference-contexts: Hence, one such media-instance we could integrate is the OVID system, though our framework is general enough to integrate many other media (which OVID cannot). The authors have developed feature identification schemes (which we have not) and this complements our work. In a similar vein, Arman et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> develop techniques to create large video databases by processing incoming video-data so as to identify features and set up access structures.

Reference-contexts: In a similar vein, Arman et. al. [2] develop techniques to create large video databases by processing incoming video-data so as to identify features and set up access structures. Another piece of relevant related work is that of the QBIC (Query by Image Content) system of Barber et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> at IBM, They develop indexing techniques to query large video databases by images in other words, one may ask queries of the form "Find me all pictures in which image I occurs."

Reference-contexts: In constrast to our theoretical framework, [3] shows how features may be identified (based on similarity) in video, and how queries can be formulated in the video domain. Cardenas, et. al. <ref> [5] </ref> have developed a query language called PICQUERY+ for querying certain kinds of federated multimedia systems. The spirit of their work is similar to ours in that both works attempt to devise query languages that access heterogeneous, federated multimedia databases. <p> The differences, though, are in the following: our notion of a media-instance is very general and captures, as special cases, many structures (e.g. documents, audio, etc.) that their framework does not appear to capture. Hence, our framework can integrate far more diverse structures than that of <ref> [5] </ref>. However, there are many features in [5] that our framework does not currently possess two of these are temporal data and uncertain information. Such features form a critical part of many domains (such as the medical domain described in [5]), and we look forward to extending our multimedia work in <p> Hence, our framework can integrate far more diverse structures than that of <ref> [5] </ref>.

Such features form a critical part of many domains (such as the medical domain described in [5]), and we look forward to extending our multimedia work in that direction, in keeping with a similar effort we have made previously [21] for integrating time, uncertainty, data structures, numeric constraints and databases. Little and Ghafoor [13] have developed methods for satisfying temporal constraints in multimedia systems. <p> Future Work: The query language developed in this paper does not handle uncertainty in the underlying media and/or temporal changes in the data. These need to be incorporated into the query language as they are relevant for various applications such as those listed by Cardenas et. al. <ref> [5] </ref>. * Is it possible to uniformly define query languages and access methods based on these indexing structures ? Accomplishments: We have developed indexing structures for organizing the features (and properties of the features) in a given media-instance, and we have developed algorithms that can be used to answer queries (expressed
