Abstract: The efficient utilization and management of bandwidth in broadband networks is of paramount importance since bandwidth costs are likely to dominate network operational costs, especially in the wide area scenario. However, relatively little attention has been given to this issue in developing the current schemes for the transport of Internet data traffic over ATM. In this paper we describe a bandwidth allocation and management approach for the transport of Internet traffic over ATM that uses Virtual Private Networks, exploits the ABR service and implements bandwidth guarantees. We also address the efficient sharing of bandwidth between Internet data traffic and other media traffic using ATM.

Reference-contexts: Namely, relatively little attention has been given to the efficient allocation, utilization and management of the underlying ATM bandwidth, and to the efficient sharing of facilities by both Internet data traffic and other media traffic transported over ATM networks. Hence, in <ref> [2] </ref> we describe a bandwidth allocation and management approach based on ATM Virtual Private Networks (AVPNs) which addresses these problems. With AVPN, we make efficient utilization of the underlying ATM bandwidth and we provide a mechanism for explicit resource reservation for the Internet data traffic.

With AVPN, we make efficient utilization of the underlying ATM bandwidth and we provide a mechanism for explicit resource reservation for the Internet data traffic. In [2] we also compared our AVPN approach to current schemes that transport the Internet traffic over end-to-end Virtual Circuit Connections (VCCs) and schemes that use a backbone of Constant Bit Rate (CBR) Virtual Path Connections (VPCs) to interconnect routers. <p> Through simulations, we demonstrated that the AVPN approach effectively improves bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we focus on the functionalities required by our scheme to deliver the bandwidth efficiency that we presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. So, in section 2 we introduce our AVPN approach to the transport of Internet traffic over ATM. In section 3 we describe the functionalities of our approach that allow for a better bandwidth utilization and in section 4 we present simulation results, highlighting the performance gains with AVPN.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in section 5 we make some concluding remarks. 2 The Internet AVPN The approach to the transport of data traffic over ATM we describe in this paper is based on the concept of ATM Virtual Private Networks (AVPNs) <ref> [3] </ref>. The basic idea on AVPN is that a large corporate user, with sites spread over 1 a large geographical area, would request a mesh of CBR VPCs to be configured over the ATM network to interconnect the user sites.

Reference-contexts: The ABR traffic, on the other hand, has the ability to fill in the unused bandwidth. Hence, at any point in time the ACR fluctuates between the MCR and the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) or the Explicit Rate (ER), whichever is smaller <ref> [4] </ref>. If the ACR remains continuously over the MCR for a long time, the Internet traffic may need more bandwidth than what is currently allocated. The LM can then take action and request an increase of MCR. <p> However, this improvement falls short in terms of what can actually be accomplished since the rate-based flow control mechanism applied to ABR connections is inherently conservative and relies on feedback information subjected to round trip delays. In fact, the ATM Forum document <ref> [4] </ref> describes the source and destination behaviors for ABR that requires sources to reduce their transmission rate on every cell transmission. <p> This is in fact a difficult task and even though the use of virtual sources and destinations is allowed by ATM Forum standards, their behavior was left unspecified <ref> [4] </ref>. The issues to be addressed in defining these behaviors include the handling of congestion at intermediate routers and the possible use of back-pressure to throttle sources affected by congestion in the network. <p> The definition of general virtual source and destination behaviors is beyond the scope of this paper and the subject of our future research. Nevertheless, in section 4 we suggest a virtual source and destination behavior for the tandem topology considered in our experiments. 3.2 Bandwidth Overbooking As described in <ref> [4] </ref>, ABR sources should continuously reduce their transmission rate even in the absence of congestion since this approach is more robust to RM cell losses; however, it is also less bandwidth efficient. <p> This ff is not fixed and it depends on the congestion level at the bottleneck switch. To determine the appropriate ff, we propose to make use of the Queue Length (QL) field in the RM cells used on the ABR flow control <ref> [4] </ref>, and have the switches stamp this field with the highest queue length on the forward path of the feedback loop.

Reference-contexts: The LM can then take action and request an increase of MCR. This can be done by accessing ATM management and control platforms such as OPENET <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that the increase on the MCR value is not time critical since the ABR control can maintain the ACR higher than the MCR, provided that there is unused bandwidth (which is different from the unassigned bandwidth needed for the MCR increase request to succeed).

Reference-contexts: Under heavy load, the aggregate traffic of 12 variable rate sources is generated; under moderate load, the aggregate traffic of 7 sources is produced. These sources have a very small burstiness, are carried over CBR connections <ref> [6] </ref>, and reserve 132.5Mbps under heavy load and 77.3Mbps under moderate load. The CBR connections are set up first, which leaves 17.5Mbps and 72.7Mbps for the Internet traffic, respectively.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, bandwidth efficiency is not the only factor of concern in an Internet backbone. With the ever increasing amount of traffic injected in these backbones and the introduction of multimedia services, efficient packet forwarding schemes are also of great importance and Ipsilon's IP switch <ref> [7] </ref> and CISCO's Tag switch [8] have been designed to address this issue. What is important to note is that the Internet AVPN can actually make use of these technologies in which the AVPN actually delivers both efficient bandwidth management and packet forwarding.
