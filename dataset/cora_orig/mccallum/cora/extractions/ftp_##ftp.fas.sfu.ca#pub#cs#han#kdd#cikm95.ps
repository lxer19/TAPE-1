Title: Mining Knowledge at Multiple Concept Levels (An invited talk)

Abstract: Most studies on data mining have been focused at mining rules at single concept levels, i.e., either at the primitive level or at a rather high concept level. However, it is often desirable to discover knowledge at multiple concept levels. Mining knowledge at multiple levels may help database users find some interesting rules which are difficult to be discovered otherwise and view database contents at different abstraction levels and from different angles. Methods for mining knowledge at multiple concept levels can often be developed by extension of existing data mining techniques. Moreover, for efficient processing and interactive mining of multiple-level rules, it is often necessary to adopt techniques such as step-by-step generalization/specialization or progressive deepening of a knowledge mining process. Other issues, such as visual representation of knowledge at multiple levels, and "redundant" rule filtering, should also be studied in depth.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With massive amounts of data stored in databases, mining information and knowledge in databases has become an important issue in recent research <ref> [1, 3, 5, 16] </ref>. Most previous studies on data mining have been focused at mining rules at single concept levels, i.e., either at a primitive concept level or at a rather high concept level. <p> Most previous studies on data mining have been focused at mining rules at single concept levels, i.e., either at a primitive concept level or at a rather high concept level. For example, mining functional dependency rules [12], strong rules [15], causal rules [13], and association rules <ref> [1, 2] </ref> in relational or transaction databases is related to finding rules usually at primitive concept levels but sometimes at a given high concept level, depending on the available data. <p> Also, it is desirable to output only those rules which may have reasonably large support, i.e., which may represent the behavior of a nontrivial subset of data. The rules with high confidence and strong support are called strong rules <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. The task of database mining is essentially the mining of strong rules in large databases. <p> Furthermore, association rules can also be discovered in a traditional relational model by first performing attribute-oriented induction and then projecting the generalized relation into different feature tables [8]. 4 Mining multiple-level knowledge in transaction databases Most studies on mining association rules <ref> [1, 2, 7, 10, 14, 20] </ref>. have taken transaction databases as a typical model of investigation because the finding of association relationships among the items in large numbers of transactions is an application-appealing and performance-demanding process.

An important property used in the progressive derivation of large k-itemsets is that for any large k itemsets, any of its subset (k 1)-itemsets must be large as well <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. Candidate sets for large k-itemsets can be worked out easily based on this property and the available large (k 1)-itemsets. Multiple-level association rules can be discovered by extensions of the available single-level association rule mining algorithms [7, 20]. One such extension [7] is outlined as follows.

Reference-contexts: A classification rule [18] is used to classify a set of data based on their values in a determining attribute. For example, a set of cars associated with many features may be classified based on their gas mileages. 5. A clustering rule <ref> [4] </ref> is used to cluster a set of data (without a determining attribute), based on the conceptual clustering principle: maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity. <p> A classification rule or a clustering rule can be obtained based on a similar attribute-oriented generalization process, depending on whether there exists a determining attribute in the classification or clustering task. Many well-studied machine learning algorithms, such as ID-3/C4.5 [17, 18] and COBWEB <ref> [4] </ref>, can be integrated with the attribute-oriented induction method by application of these methods (with certain modifications) on the generalized relations. For mining multiple-level knowledge, progressive deepening and progressive generalization techniques can be applied in the attribute-oriented generalization processes.

Data items in transactions are assumed to be organized into taxonomies according to their associated properties. For example, a particular brand and product of milk belongs to milk, then dairy products, and then food, which form a concept hierarchy. <p> Some of these rules can be considered are redundant and be eliminated from the knowledge base to avoid the inclusion of many superfluous rules. An interesting measurement for the generation of only interesting rules at mining multiple-level association rules proposed in <ref> [20] </ref> is as follows. In principle, a rule is considered redundant if it does not convey additional information and is less general than another rule. <p> Efficient methods have been developed to discover interesting (i.e., nonredundant) multiple-level association rules <ref> [20] </ref>. It seems that a similar measurement can be developed in the mining of characteristic and discriminant rules at multiple concept levels.
