Abstract: guage. Interactive graphics programs such as Mac--Draw, idraw and tgif will produce PostScript output. And the psfig/T E X macro package can be used to include arbitrary PostScript figures into L a T E X documents. But this practice should be avoided if possible. The PostScript output can only be read by machines and cannot be maintained by humans independent of the programs that generated them. Collaborators or publishers at remote locations may not have a printer which accepts PostScript. It will do no good to email the document. And the document must be transmitted via much slower, more expensive and less reliable surface mail which may result in a breakdown of communication and missed deadlines. To run latex, bibtex and slitex, the path variable in the .cshrc file in your home directory should include /usr/local/bin. Documentation for the psfig/T E X macro package can be found in the /s/local1/psfig-1.9 directory. Documentation for GNUPLOT can be found in the /s/local1/gnuplot-3.5/docs directory. There are copies of the EPIC, EEPIC, GNUPLOT and P I CT E X manuals in the CSD Archives. There is a very large T E X Users Group (TUG). Someone somewhere almost certainly has a L a T E X macro to do almost anything that you want to do. Subscribe to the comp.text.tex newsgroup. You can use the Pnews program to post news to this group if you have questions abot L a T E X. But first you should check the frequently asked question (FAQ) file which can be obtained via anonymous ftp from cs.nyu.edu in pub/tex/tex.supplement. This file includes a brief description of L a T E X macros and related programs along with the archive sites where the can be retrieved via anonymous ftp for free!
