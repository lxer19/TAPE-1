Title: On Bounding the Betti Numbers and Computing the Euler Characteristic of Semi-algebraic Sets  
Author: Saugata Basu 
Keyword: s of arbitrary semi-algebraic sets.  
Abstract: In this paper we give a new bound on the sum of the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets. This extends a well-known bound due to Oleinik and Petrovsky [19], Thom [23] and Milnor [18]. In separate papers they proved that the sum of the Betti numbers of a semi-algebraic set S R k ; defined by P 1 0; : : : ; P s 0; deg(P i ) d; 1 i s; is bounded by (O(sd)) k : Given a semi-algebraic set S R k defined as the intersection of a real variety, Q = 0; deg(Q) d; whose real dimension is k 0 ; with a set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula with atoms of the form, P i = 0; P i &gt; 0; P i &lt; 0; deg(P i ) d; 1 i s; we prove that the sum of the Betti numbers of S is bounded by s k 0 (O(d)) k : In the special case, when S is defined by Q = 0; P 1 &gt; 0; : : :; P s &gt; 0; we have a slightly tighter bound of (O(d)) k : This result generalises the Oleinik-Petrovsky-Thom-Milnor bound in two directions. Firstly, our bound applies to arbitrary semi-algebraic sets, not just for basic semi-algebraic sets. Secondly, the combinatorial part (the part depending on s) in our bound, depends on the dimension of the variety rather than that of the ambient space. It also generalizes a result in [7] where a similar bound is proven for the number of connected components. In the second part of the paper we use the tools developed for the above results, as well as some additional techniques, to give the first single exponential time algorithm for computing the Euler characteristic

Reference-contexts: Our argument depends on perturbing the polynomials by various infinitesimals and to work over the field of Puiseux series in these infinitesimals. We write Rh*i for the real closed field of Puiseux series in * with coefficients in R <ref> [2] </ref>. The sign of an element in this field agrees with the sign of the coefficient of the lowest degree term in *. This order makes * positive and smaller than any positive element of R.

Reference-contexts: We also note that the asymptotic complexities of all the real algebraic algorithms that we use, do not change if we introduce a constant number of these infinitesimals <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 Going to general position Following [5], we say that a family of polynomials P in k variables is in general position if no k + 1 of them have a common real zero. <p> We also note that the asymptotic complexities of all the real algebraic algorithms that we use, do not change if we introduce a constant number of these infinitesimals <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 Going to general position Following [5], we say that a family of polynomials P in k variables is in general position if no k + 1 of them have a common real zero. <p> Let Q 0 be the family [ i fQ + i ; Q Lemma 3 For sufficiently small ffi &gt; 0; the family of polynomials Q 0 is in general position. Proof: See <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 For a sign condition on Q; without any equalities, define (Q; ffi) to be the formula obtained as follows: Every conjunct Q i &gt; 0 is replaced by Q i 0; while every conjunct Q i &lt; 0 is replaced by Q + i 0: Let S (ffi) be <p> of polynomials P is in general position with respect to a polynomial Q; then for an infinitesimal * the family [ P 2P fP; P + *; P *g is also in general position with respect to Q as long as we consider zeros that are bounded over R (see <ref> [5] </ref> for details). This is implicit in the proofs presented below. 4 4 Bound on the Betti numbers of a semi-algebraic set We make use of the following facts from algebraic topology which follows easily from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence (see [1]). <p> The new system will have at most 6s + 1 polynomials with degrees at most 2d: Moreover, we now have to compute in a larger ring Z [ffi; *; ]: However, since we have introduced only three infinitesimals, the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is not affected (see <ref> [5] </ref>). 5.1 Algorithmic Preliminaries In our algorithm we will utilize several other algorithms from real algebraic geometry as subroutines.

Reference-contexts: Note that a bound of s on the zero-th Betti number for arbitrary semi-algebraic sets (which is just the number of connected components) was known before <ref> [6] </ref> and our bound is a generalization of this result to the higher Betti numbers. <p> For example, the bound on the number of connected components in <ref> [6] </ref> plays a crucial role in the proof of the main result in [12], where the variety is the real Grassmannian G m;n (the space of m dimensional subspaces of R n ), embedded as a m (n m) dimensional variety in R n 2 : Remark: In the special case <p> with Q: Moreover, consider the intersection of a semi-algebraic set defined by a family of polynomials P with Z (Q): Using the same arguments as in the proof of proposition 1, always carrying along the extra condition Q = 0; and replacing the polynomials H i by different infinitesimals (see <ref> [6] </ref> for details), we can replace S " Z (Q) by a compact semi-algebraic set contained in Z (Q); having the same homotopy type, but defined by at most 6s + 1 polynomials in general position with respect to Q.

A Whitney stratification of a space X is a decomposition of X into submanifolds called strata, which satisfy certain frontier conditions, (see [11] page 37). In particular, given a compact set bounded by a smooth hypersurface, the boundary and the interior form a Whitney stratification. 8 Now, let X be a compact Whitney stratified subset of R k ; and f a restriction to X of a smooth function. <p> A critical point of f is defined to be a critical point of the restriction of f to any stratum, and a critical value of f is the value of f at a critical point. The first fundamental result of stratified Morse theory is the following. Theorem 3 (Goresky-MacPherson, <ref> [11] </ref>) As c varies in the open interval between two adjacent critical values, the topological type of X " f 1 ((1; c]) remains constant.
