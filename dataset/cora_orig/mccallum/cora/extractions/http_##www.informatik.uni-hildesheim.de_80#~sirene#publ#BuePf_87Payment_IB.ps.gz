Y has to choose the operators sign y and auth y at random, which will be used for signing and verifying authentication of messages, respectively. <p> Thus, if he stops communication prematurely, a claim against him will remain valid, which should be called in if necessary. Solutions for the simultaneity problem developed for signing contracts <ref> [15, 1] </ref> are not suitable for value exchange in general, since one cannot define that e.g. a message only has a meaning if it is signed n times (with prefixes 1 through n) whereas one can define that a contract is only binding if it is signed n times.

Reference-contexts: To hide these traffic data too, the relation between sender and recipient must be kept secret (unlinkability), or stronger, both sender and recipient of a message are kept secret. Unlinkability of sender and recipient can be realized by special network stations, so called MIXes <ref> [5] </ref>. A MIX collects a number of messages from different senders, changes their encodings and forwards them to the recipients in a different order. This measure hides the relation between sender and recipient from everybody but the MIX. <p> In order to guarantee anonymity of individuals, a digital signature must not be associated with an individual directly but with a digital pseudonym <ref> [5, 7] </ref> which is used by that individual.

For authentication a single trusted third party [22] (who may be different for different participants as shown in figure 14) or a chain of trusted third parties <ref> [5] </ref> may be used. The second method has the property that a participant can be identified only if all authenticating third parties are cooperating. It can be extended to tolerate faults or sabotage from a few third parties with the techniques described in [29].

Reference-contexts: A participating station can decide which messages are actually for it by scanning every message for a special attribute, called implicit address [30]. A powerful scheme for sender anonymity is superposed sending, which is published in <ref> [7] </ref> and is called DC-network (Dining Cryptographers network) there. Unfortunately superposed sending requires either a tremendous amount of secret communication for key exchange between the participating stations before messages can be sent, thereby complicating work in practice, or very fast generation of cryptographically strong pseudorandom keys [3, 29 p. 18]. <p> In order to guarantee anonymity of individuals, a digital signature must not be associated with an individual directly but with a digital pseudonym <ref> [5, 7] </ref> which is used by that individual. Digital pseudonyms are just (almost unique) numbers (or pairs thereof) which are created by individuals through a special random process. It is assumed that every individual uses different digital pseudonyms wherever possible to restrict linkability to a minimum. <p> Granted authentication is applied in those cases when a declaration can be made only when an authorization from another (e.g. superior) instance can be shown. These authorizations or credentials should be issued to digital pseudonyms, not directly to the individuals. Special measures <ref> [7] </ref> can prevent the third parties granting authentication, e.g. banks, from deriving undesired concatenations, even in cooperation with those to whom the credentials are shown. 4 In the following we assume that networks without user observability are used. <p> This and different possibilities to guarantee that the bank receives all transaction number pairs, is described in full detail in [36]. 3 . 2 . 3 Blindly Signed Digital Banknotes Next, we describe a payment system invented by David Chaum <ref> [6, 7] </ref> realizing anonymity cut 3 only, i.e. independently whether anonymity cuts 1 and 2 are realized or not. This payment system establishes clearing anonymity by unobservability of each currency with itself, cf. section 3.1.2. <p> The specification of Y in step [6.5] may be any digital pseudonym of Y, e.g. the digital pseudonym under which Y is known to the bank as holder of an (anonymous numbered) account. <ref> [7] </ref> Y checks the confirmation of reservation received in step [6.5] and forwards it to X: [7.1] Y : auth B ([6.5]) [7.2] Y - [6.5] -&gt; X [8] X checks the confirmation of reservation received from Y in step [7.2] and sends Y the precursor to the note number: [8.1] <p> To unlink the two transactions described above, clients should be able to change the identity of their digital pseudonyms known to the bank the same way as they can with blindly signed digital banknotes. This can be done by using the same special measure <ref> [7] </ref> which is applied to hinder the credentials issuing organizations from deriving undesired concatenations (cf. section 2.2) and which is based on blind signatures as well. 3 . 4 . 2 Combinations Enabling Offline Payments Even Without Absolutely Tamper-resistant Devices Obviously, the usability of digital payment systems increases when they can

Reference-contexts: By decrypting it, he can establish clearing anonymity (independently whether he is payer or payee), even against a coalition of the other and the bank. Clearly, the protocols for a payment vary slightly depending on who encrypts and later decrypts the banknote <ref> [8] </ref>. To allow payer and payee to verify clearing anonymity, both parties have to encrypt and later decrypt the banknote. 2 In the following, we will only consider in detail the variation, where the payer encrypts the note number. Therefore, it seems appropriate to outline the other variations. <p> By definition of a one-way-function, it is impossible to compute the precursor out of the note number efficiently. The following protocol shows withdrawal, payment and deposit of a digital banknote. This is an extended version of Chaum's original and still unpublished bank-proof payer anonymity protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. The extension is necessary to use this payment system for payments between two remote and anonymous parties. The substantial improvements are the introduction of an expiry date for each reservation and receipts of payments.

However, this can also be achieved if anonymously transferable standard values are used. The key idea is to use a mixing transformation whereby a set of anonymously transferable standard values with the same nominal values is randomly transfered from one set of digital pseudonyms to another. <p> Special methods even allow to obtain interest for digital banknotes <ref> [8] </ref>. 31 4 Value Exchange Systems Enabling Security and Unobservability The main problem arising in value exchange over a network, e.g. in the exchange of digital money against other valuable information, is the lack of simultaneity of the exchange, yielding a temporary advantage for one of the business partners.

(The more general attack by a virus as described by Fred Cohen <ref> [11] </ref> can be restricted to the one just described by signing programs digitally, as proposed for slightly other reasons in [14 p.317], and checking the signature before execution.) For all these technical reasons, the complex computer equipment used for digital payments cannot be trustworthy, and thus, neither can the banks using

Reference-contexts: Coding only. The security of both methods (like of seemingly all other digital payment systems, also those not enabling unobservability) depends on cryptography, though unfortunately as yet the security of cryptosystems cannot be proved from scratch. The first method additionally uses tamper-resistant devices <ref> [13] </ref> (e.g. chipcards) where the digitally transferable currencies are kept in. <p> Money is transfered in the usual way in the level of banks <ref> [13] </ref>. However, in lieu of special banking forms and handwritten signatures, digitally signed messages (in standard formats) are used. The bank signs messages digitally as well, which can be verified by every party in the system. <p> A protocol allowing mutual verification if the partner chipcard is an authentic chipcard too, is executed, and then the money is transfered by transmitting digital cheques (signed messages with unique transaction numbers, cf. <ref> [13, p. 331] </ref>). The transaction is completed when the paying chipcard receives a receipt of payment from the chipcard of the payee. <p> The problem to form messages which contain secret information is one of the basic problems of cryptography and can be solved in various ways. The method applied in this case uses a public one-way-function f <ref> [13] </ref>. The note numbers are of the form f (x) completed by redundancy for some argument x known to the payer only. The argument x is called precursor to the argument f (x) and to the resulting note number.

The latter alternative is more secure, since RSA is not provably as secure as factoring is difficult, but is clearly broken if factoring the modulus is feasible.

Reference-contexts: Chipcards used in this way can be seen as "electronic wallets" <ref> [16, 25] </ref> or minibanks with one account [28], since the tasks of a bank are substituted and manipulation is (or should be) impossible. Thus, a chipcard is a substitute for a trusted third party by whom the payments are conducted.

However, the expense of the necessary application of cryptographically strong one-way functions has admittedly been neglected there and would cause a substantial expense probably in the order of a RSA exponentiation.

Reference-contexts: Digital signatures can be formed e.g. by encryption of the declaration with the best known but old-fashioned public key cryptosystem (PKCS) RSA [14] or by using any efficient digital signature system which is provably as secure as factoring is difficult <ref> [21, 3 20] </ref>. The latter alternative is more secure, since RSA is not provably as secure as factoring is difficult, but is clearly broken if factoring the modulus is feasible. <p> Another possibility to break the system might be a chosen signature attack.

Reference-contexts: all, anonymity cut 1 is realized. 16 X Y withdrawal of money transaction: payment deposit of money clearing 1 4 3 transaction: receipt of payment Clearly, if chipcards with identity are used, e.g. a serial number (exchanged within each transaction of that chipcard) or an unique keypair of a PKCS <ref> [22] </ref> which never changes during the life cycle of the card, all actions made with a single chipcard are linkable in principle. Therefore, the cards should not have identities (or at least conceal them from their transaction partners) which implies that all authentic chipcards should have a key in common. <p> This is an example for granted authentication, since before any business is done, the participants have to authenticate themselves mutually by means of these credentials. Later on business proceeds as usual. For authentication a single trusted third party <ref> [22] </ref> (who may be different for different participants as shown in figure 14) or a chain of trusted third parties [5] may be used. The second method has the property that a participant can be identified only if all authenticating third parties are cooperating.

Reference-contexts: Receiving a message can be made anonymous to the network by delivering the message to all stations (broadcast) or at least to sufficiently many (multicast). A participating station can decide which messages are actually for it by scanning every message for a special attribute, called implicit address <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that every individual uses different digital pseudonyms wherever possible to restrict linkability to a minimum. There are two forms of authentication which should be distinguished: self-authentication and granted authentication <ref> [31] </ref>. The form of authentication when someone refers to previous declarations of his own is called self-authentication. This form corresponds to one's handwritten signature. <p> Before these payment systems and other appropriate anonymous transaction protocols can be used in practice, the legal framework has to be adapted appropriately <ref> [31] </ref>. But this would be necessary for any digital payment and transaction system anyway. Last but not least we want to remind that today the state bears the full risk of the cash system without installing a nearly perfect supervision and control system encircling everyone everywhere.

Reference-contexts: The circumstance that great frauds were rare (or at least not reported) up to now and could have been covered from the insurances <ref> [32] </ref>, together with the missing awareness of the clients that their privacy is extremely endangered by these systems (and cannot be covered by any insurance) should not induce anybody to hold on to insufficient payment systems.

Reference-contexts: If the receipt of payment should fail to come, the paying chipcard is not able to decide whether the chipcard of the payee has sent a receipt which got lost or whether the transmitted digital cheque got already lost before, since this is a classical "two-army-problem" <ref> [33, p. 477] </ref>. Since the paying chip-card should not wait forever for the receipt, it should switch into a special state after a timeout which serves as evidence that a payment was made without receiving a receipt.

(The more general attack by a virus as described by Fred Cohen [11] can be restricted to the one just described by signing programs digitally, as proposed for slightly other reasons in [14 p.317], and checking the signature before execution.)

Reference-contexts: For this, it is not sufficient to hide the content of a message only, which can be done by end-to-end-encryption <ref> [35] </ref>, since an attacker could still see who sends how many messages to whom and at what time (traffic analysis). To hide these traffic data too, the relation between sender and recipient must be kept secret (unlinkability), or stronger, both sender and recipient of a message are kept secret.
