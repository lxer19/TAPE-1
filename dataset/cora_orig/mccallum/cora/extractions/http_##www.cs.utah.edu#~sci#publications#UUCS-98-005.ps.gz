Abstract: We derive the analytic transformation for minimizing the summed-squared-distance between three movable points in one three-space pose to three corresponding fixed points in another three-space pose. This change of basis is a general rigid-body transformation (translation and rotation), with the addition of a uniform scale. We also derive and present the root-mean-squared distance between the final transformed points and the fixed points.

Reference-contexts: However, if the object being scanned has moved within that space, a coregistration process is required to move the poses into alignment. In the vision literature, this problem is referred to as the "pose recovery" problem <ref> [1] </ref>. The notion being that information about an object is obtained in a 2-D (image) or 3-D (laser range data) scan.
