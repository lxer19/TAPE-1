Abstract: Robotic explorers perform multiple tasks and have multiple constraints to optimize. Planning the best sequence of tasks requires information about how a given sequence will affect the constraints and goals of the explorer. Modules for all constraints and goals are created, each one of which evaluates a given plan from its point of view. The resulting values of the modules are then combined in a weighted sum, producing a score for each plan. The best plan is then selected. Robots have progressed from simple mechanical tools designed for single jobs to complex devices able to handle multiple tasks. These tasks may be independently carried out by separate parts and resources of the robot, be dependent on the right resources being available at the right time, or be dependent on the results of other tasks or user input. Such a robot must be able to plan the proper sequence of tasks. One way to do this is to pre-program into the robot a well-defined sequence of tasks. A problem with this is that changes in the environment may require changes in the sequence of tasks. For a robot exploring an unknown environment, determining the proper sequence of tasks ahead of time may even be impossible. Another way is to have the human operator send commands for the tasks one at a time. Problems with this occur when the robot is far away from the human operator, and time delays prevent seeing the results of a given command quickly. For tasks that depend on the state of the environment, such control from a distance is difficult, especially when rapid decisions have to be made. A third way is to have the robot itself determine the sequence of tasks to be carried out, allowing changes in the environment to be incorporated into the planning. In this case, the robot reasons about its ability to perform various tasks as well as the probable results of performing those tasks, all with respect to the current environment. For a multi-purpose robotic explorer, this method of sequencing tasks needs to be used at least partially, with human operator decisions used for determining large-scale goals if desired. A robotic explorer will have multiple tasks to perform, as well as multiple constraints to optimize. Some of these tasks might include covering an area as completely as possible, searching for new areas, investigating certain rocks or soil samples with additional sensors, extracting core samples with a drill, performing geological tests of rocks, or setting up equipment or structures for the use of future human explorers. Constraints the robotic explorer may need to optimize include power gain from sources such as the sun or wind, power consumption, and visibility of a site. When traveling in a hilly area, the robot may need to constrain its path to avoid shadows as they move throughout the day, to maintain sunlight on its solar panels. The orientation of the robot, if it has fixed solar panels, is another factor which may have to be incorporated into the planning. The task planner combines all the constraints with the desired tasks to generate the best plan for the robotic explorer. The specific constraints and tasks that are needed for a given robot will be determined ahead of time, as in the example application shown later. Each one of these constraints and tasks will be defined in one or more modules, as described in the section below. The following section explains how the task planner then integrates the outputs of these modules to select a plan. A module is a self-contained unit which deals with a particular constraint or aspect of a task pertaining to the robotic explorer, either a cost or a benefit. For example, one module could be for solar power gained by the robots solar panels, another could be for power consumed by the robots locomotion system, another could be for information gained by the investigation of a rock with a spectrometer, and another could be for percentage of an area covered by the robot. These are all values of interest to the planner.
