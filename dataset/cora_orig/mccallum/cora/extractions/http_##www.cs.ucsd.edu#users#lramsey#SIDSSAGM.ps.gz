Abstract: In an image database application, one would like to be able to pose simple queries of the form Find object(s) X in some geometric relation to object(s) Y. A query to a database of satellite images might be find a river running south of a city or find a lake with a dam that is within 100 miles of an orchard. We model the problem of searching an image database as an instance of labelled subgraph matching. A query can be translated into a graph by associating one or more nodes with each query feature (lakes, towns, etc.) and encoding geometric constraints in the edges. Then performing a search of the database means matching the query graph to the graph of the image. We use the Gabor filter based texture analysis method of Manjunath and Ma (1996) to generate a feature label for each area of the database image. To solve the resulting (NP-complete) labelled subgraph matching problem, we use the Soft Assign method, an efficient optimizing framework based on mean-field annealing neural networks. We dramatically reduce the size of the target graph by computing lower bounds on the cost function in all areas of the image, using precompiled data structures. Experimental results show that this method can be used to find image features quickly, in a manner robust to noise.

Reference-contexts: Searching the database images means finding the best match of the query graph within the target graph (composed perhaps of multiple disconnected image graphs), subject to the geometric constraints given by the edges of the query graph. This is an instance of Maximum Attributed Subgraph matching, which is NP-Complete <ref> (Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref>. Finding the best match means minimizing an objective function which gives the cost of any particular match, subject to the constraint that each node in the query graph must match to one node in the image graph.

Reference-contexts: This method has been shown to be superior to other texture classification schemes judged by the ability to retrieve subjectively similar textures from both standard pattern collections as well as satellite images <ref> (Manjunath & Ma, 1996) </ref>. In a satellite image, blocks that contain such features as roads, farmland, bodies of water or buildings are effectively grouped together into their respective classes and codewords.
