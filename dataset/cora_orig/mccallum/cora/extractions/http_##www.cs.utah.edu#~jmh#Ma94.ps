Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous method to calibrate joint torque sensors for advanced robots; as a by-product, the position sensors can also be calibrated. When one joint of a manipulator is rotated, the gravity torque exerted on the joint varies sinusoidally with rotation angle. By means of sinusoidal curve fitting, the bias of the torque sensor and the gain of the position sensor can be found directly. The gravity vector, expressed in the defined base coordinates, can also be found. Thereafter we determine the torque sensor gain as well as the rotation angle offset, by attaching a known load to robot in different positions. Experi- mental results are shown for the first two joints of the Sarcos Dextrous Arm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Joint torque information is required in inertial parameter identification and model-based control <ref> [1] </ref>; it may even be used for kinematic calibration [6]. While joint torque sensing continues to be a problem for robots, the advent of robot manipulators with high resolution joint torque and position sensors makes many algorithms practical [8]. <p> Usually link inertial parameter identification requires joint torque information <ref> [1] </ref>. When calibrating joint torque sensors, we should assume no exact knowledge of link inertial parameters. In fact, these parameters can only be found with calibrated torque and position sensors. To eliminate the unknown torque due to links, we attach a load whose mass and COG are known.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we show a method to find g with the intrinsic joint torque and position sensors of a manipulator.

An interesting by-product of our torque sensor calibration method is that the joint angle sensor gains and offsets can also be calibrated. Al- though the accuracy of this approach probably will not reach that possible with traditional kinematic calibration methods [9], we present it as an option.

Reference-contexts: For the torque sensor gain calibration, hanging a mass on a known lever arm is the usual method. For autonomous robots, these procedures are certainly not the ideal ones. A calibration procedure for six axial force sensors has been proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. However, to our knowledge, this paper is the first one to address the problem of autonomous calibration of the joint torque sensors. Knowing the gravity vector g is another important issue for robot control; this knowledge is also required for our calibration method.

Arm. 3 Experiment results 3.1 Sarcos Dextrous Arm The Sarcos Dextrous Arm is a ten degree-of-freedom (DOF) hydraulically powered anthropomorphic arm which includes a three DOF multipurpose end effector <ref> [8] </ref>. The arm DOFs are configured with a roll- pitch-roll spherical shoulder joint, a rotary elbow joint and a roll-pitch-yaw spherical wrist. All DOFs are instrumented with joint torque and rotation position sensors.

Reference-contexts: Calibrating joint torque sensors usually requires tedious human involvement. To find the torque sensor bias of a joint, one method is to manually adjust the bias so that the joint moves freely to align itself with gravity <ref> [10] </ref>; this method is somewhat qualitative. For the torque sensor gain calibration, hanging a mass on a known lever arm is the usual method. For autonomous robots, these procedures are certainly not the ideal ones. A calibration procedure for six axial force sensors has been proposed in [5]. <p> When we installed the Sarcos Dextrous Arm in our laboratory, we found both the gains and the offsets of the RVDTs have shifted from the calibrated values given in the manual by about 5% . The RVDT had been recalibrated using the manual procedure described in <ref> [10] </ref> before our calibration experiment. For the Sarcos Dextrous Arm, the += 10 V torque sensor analog output is converted with a 12-bit A/D to give 0 to 4096 counts, where 2048 counts correspond to 0 V sensor output.
