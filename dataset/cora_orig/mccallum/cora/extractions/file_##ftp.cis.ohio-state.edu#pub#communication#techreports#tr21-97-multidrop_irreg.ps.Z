Reference-contexts: Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are systems using this switching technique. These systems have regular network topologies with various deadlock-free routing schemes. More recently, this switching technique is being applied to switch-based interconnects like Myrinet <ref> [1] </ref> and ServerNet [4] to build networks of workstations for cost-effective parallel computing. Such networks typically have irregular topology which provides flexibility to design scalable systems with incremental expansion capability. The irregularity also makes the routing on such systems quite complicated. <p> Thus, the interconnection topology of the network can be denoted by a graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of switches, and E is the set of bidirectional links between the switches <ref> [1, 5, 14] </ref>. Figure 1 (b) shows the interconnection graph for the irregular network in Fig. 1 (a). The switches can implement different types of switching techniques: wormhole, virtual cut-through, or ATM. These switches can also implement different routing schemes [1, 4, 13, 14]. <p> Figure 1 (b) shows the interconnection graph for the irregular network in Fig. 1 (a). The switches can implement different types of switching techniques: wormhole, virtual cut-through, or ATM. These switches can also implement different routing schemes <ref> [1, 4, 13, 14] </ref>. In this paper we focus on wormhole switches and assume the Autonet [14] routing scheme due to its simplicity and its commercial implementation.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach demonstrated that collective communication operations can be implemented on MPP networks with reduced latency. This concept was futher extended to allow multidestination worms to take row-column paths <ref> [2] </ref> and all paths conforming to the base routing using the Base Routing Conformed Path (BRCP) model [12]. Modern cut-through switches possess the capability of simultaneous replication of an incoming worm to multiple output ports [14].

Reference-contexts: The final destination absorbs the complete worm. 4 3.2 Tree-based Multidestination Worms The above path-based multidestination mechanism (with a header of destination ids) cannot be directly applied to switch-based networks because there is no one-to-one correspondence between switches/routers and processors on such networks. Thus a tree-based mechanism <ref> [3, 10, 15, 17] </ref> has been proposed which allows a multidestination worm to replicate at switches with multiple replicas of the worm following different paths in the network. In this approach, the switches possess the capability to replicate flits of an arriving multidestination worm to multiple output ports.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems support only point-to-point (unicast) message passing. This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination. This leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange <ref> [7, 5, 18] </ref>. In order to reduce the number of phases to implement collective communication operations a Hamiltonian Path-based scheme was proposed on MPP networks [6]. <p> These algorithms are evaluated over a range of system parameters, and compared with the best unicast-based multicast algorithm, the CCO algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. The MDP-LG algorithm shows benefits of 50%, 40%, and 20% for multicast latency when compared to the CCO, MDP-G, MDP-B algorithms, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the multi-drop path-based multidestination mechanism promises significant potential to implement fast and efficient collective communication operations in future switch-based irregular systems. <p> Thus, the interconnection topology of the network can be denoted by a graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of switches, and E is the set of bidirectional links between the switches <ref> [1, 5, 14] </ref>. Figure 1 (b) shows the interconnection graph for the irregular network in Fig. 1 (a). The switches can implement different types of switching techniques: wormhole, virtual cut-through, or ATM. These switches can also implement different routing schemes [1, 4, 13, 14]. <p> In our recent work <ref> [5] </ref>, we defined the concept of a POC with the specific purpose of constructing an ordering among switches in an irregular network to reduce link contention between two messages of the same multicast using unicast message passing. <p> All these algorithms use the POC concept to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches, and group these POCs in some hierarchy to implement multi-cast. Let us first look at how the POCs are constructed. 6.1 Construction of POCs In <ref> [5] </ref>, we described a method to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches of a multicast. Figure 12 in the Appendix formally describes the method. 11 We explain the method using an example multicast. The interested reader can refer to [5] for details. are two processors connected <p> constructed. 6.1 Construction of POCs In <ref> [5] </ref>, we described a method to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches of a multicast.

A flit-level wormhole-routed simulator WORMULSim was used to model the irregular network. For all simulation experiments, we assumed system and technological parameters representing the current trend in technology. <p> For all experiments (unless otherwise stated) we assumed the following default system configuration: a 256 processor system interconnected by 64 eight-port switches and network having 75% connectivity, as defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. The default message length was assumed to be 128 flits. We performed several experiments to study the impact of system size, message length, communication start-up time, switch size, and degree of connectivity on single multicast latency for varying sizes of destination sets.

Reference-contexts: This leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange [7, 5, 18]. In order to reduce the number of phases to implement collective communication operations a Hamiltonian Path-based scheme was proposed on MPP networks <ref> [6] </ref>. This scheme uses a modified router organization to support propagation of multidestination messages (a message with multiple destinations) and allows a message to be consumed at a destination node while being forwarded to the next node concurrently. <p> Next, we discuss tree-based multidestination worms on switch-based irregular networks, and show the motivation for path-based multidestination worms on such networks. 3.1 Multidestination Message Passing and Path-based Worms The concept of wormhole message passing with multiple destinations was first introduced by Lin and Ni for <ref> [6] </ref> Hamiltonian meshes. Then, the multidestination message passing was introduced [12] for k-ary n-cube networks with different base routing schemes. These schemes were proposed for regular direct networks typical of MPPs. In such networks each node consists of a router and a processor. <p> Such a mechanism allows easy construction of paths (of switches) in an irregular network. It simplifies handling of deadlock problems because a worm does not get replicated into several worms, branched over multiple paths. It also allows simplified header encoding by using a variation of the all-destination encoding <ref> [6, 12] </ref> where `destination' ids are replaced by `switch' ids and ids of `destinations connected to a switch'. Figure 3 (a) shows an example of a multi-drop path-based multidestination worm. <p> It also requires minimal modification to the switch and results in low complexity for creation of multidestination worms. 6 encoding. 4.2 The Multi-drop Header Encoding Scheme This new scheme is a hybrid of the all-destination <ref> [6, 12] </ref> and multiport [15] encoding schemes. It makes use of the fact that switches too have unique addresses in a typical switch-based irregular network like Autonet [14]. The current implementation of the Autonet switch can route messages addressed to a particular switch.
