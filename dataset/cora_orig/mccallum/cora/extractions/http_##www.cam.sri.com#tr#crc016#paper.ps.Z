Abstract: Much research in computational linguistics has concentrated on treating the individual phenomena of natural language rather than on how these treatments can be made to work together. This paper discusses four respects in which processes embodying individual treatments must be made to co-operate with one another if anaphoric expressions are to be interpreted correctly. These are the coordination of (1) treatments of anaphoric and non-anaphoric ambiguity in a sentence; (2) treatments of different kinds of knowledge relevant to interpretation; (3) the resolution of several anaphors in one sentence; and (4) candidate referents arising from several sources. It is argued that a flexible control structure based on numerical scoring allows the required co-operation to take place, whereas a more limited depth-first architecture seems not to allow this. The discussion is grounded in comparisons between two very different implemented systems that resolve anaphors. The first, SPAR, is an experimental system embodying the control structure argued for. The second, the SRI Core Language Engine, is a wide-coverage system intended for practical applications. Its control structure is, at the time of writing, depth-first, but planned enhancements will allow the problems discussed in the paper to be tackled, resulting in the development of a powerful and widely-applicable natural language processor.

Reference-contexts: The "body part" sense of "leg" allows the first suggestion to be accepted, but the other sense does not. The "body part" reading therefore escapes being given a penalty point, and is accepted as being referentially more successful <ref> (see Carter, 1987a, for a fuller discussion) </ref>. However, a depth-first architecture like that of CLE-1 does not allow reference resolution to determine the resolution of other ambiguities in this way.

Reference-contexts: This will be discussed below in terms of the interaction between the focusing and inference components of a system. The democratic approach is closely related to the more general idea of a blackboard architecture, as used in speech recognition <ref> (see e.g. Erman and Lesser, 1980, on the HEARSAY-II system) </ref> and other tasks. A blackboard architecture is characterized by a number of distinct knowledge sources which interact by proposing and evaluating hypotheses stored in one or more common areas.

Reference-contexts: Such preferences operate at every linguistic level. Some instances are: * context-derived preferences for one sense of a word over another, as modelled, for example, in script-based processing <ref> (Schank and Abelson, 1977) </ref> and systems using marker passing or spreading activation (Alshawi, 1987; Hirst, 1987); * syntactic preferences for one structure over another, such as right association and minimal attachment (Frazier and Fodor, 1979; Wilks, Huang and Fass, 1985); * semantic preferences in the form of the expectations of some
