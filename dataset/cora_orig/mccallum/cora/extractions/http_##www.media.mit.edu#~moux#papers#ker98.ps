Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Software agents automate a variety of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. This paper surveys several of these agent-mediated electronic commerce systems by describing their roles in the context of a Consumer Buying Behavior (CBB) model. The CBB model we present augments traditional Marketing models with concepts from Software Agents research to accommodate the growing (non-traditional) electronic markets. We then discuss the variety of Artificial Intelligence technologies that support agent mediation and conclude with future directions of agent-mediated electronic commerce research.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Software agents are programs to which one can delegate (aspects of) a task. They differ from traditional software in that they are personalized, continuously running and semi-autonomous. These qualities make agents useful for a wide variety of information and process management tasks <ref> [1] </ref>. It should come as no surprise that these same qualities are particularly useful for the information-rich and process-rich environment of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce encompasses a broad range of issues including security, trust, reputation, law, payment mechanisms, advertising, ontologies, online catalogs, intermediaries, multimedia shopping experiences, and back-office management.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the CBB model is a powerful tool to help us understand the roles of agents as mediators in electronic commerce. 2.1. Consumer Buying Behavior Model There are several models that attempt to capture Consumer Buying Behavior - e.g., the Nicosia model <ref> [4] </ref>, the Howard-Sheth model [5], the Engel-Blackwell model [6], the Bettman information-processing model [7], and the Andreasen model [8]. Although different, these models all share a similar list of six fundamental stages guiding consumer buying behavior. <p> This includes the evaluation of merchant alternatives based on consumer-provided criteria (e.g., price, warranty, availability, delivery time, reputation, etc.). The Nicosia model merges both brokering stages into one Search Evaluation stage <ref> [4] </ref>. The Engel-Blackwell model dis-ects these two stages orthogonally into an Information Search stage and an Evaluation of Alternatives stage [6]. 4. Negotiation This stage is about how to determine the terms of the transaction. Negotiation varies in duration and complexity depending on the market. <p> Traditional CBB models do not identify this stage explicitly, but the conclusion of the Negotiation stage is comparable to the Choice or Decision stage found in other models <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. 5. Purchase and Delivery The purchase and delivery of a product can either signal the termination of the negotiation stage or occur sometime afterwards (in either order). In some cases, the available payment (e.g., cash only) or delivery options can influence product and merchant brokering. 6.

Reference-contexts: This occurs after a need has been identified (i.e., in the Need Identification stage) and is achieved through a critical evaluation of retrieved product information. Table 1 shows several agent systems that assist consumers in deciding which products best fit his/her personal criteria: PersonaLogic, Firefly, and Tete-a-Tete. PersonaLogic <ref> [10] </ref> is a tool that enables consumers to narrow down the products that best meet their needs by guiding them through a large product feature space. The system filters out unwanted products within a given domain by allowing shoppers to specify constraints on a products features.
Reference: [11] <institution> Firefly URL: &lt;http://www.firefly.com/&gt; </institution>
Reference-contexts: A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) engine then returns an ordered list of only those products that satisfy all of the hard constraints. PersonaLogic is marketed as a service that merchants offer to their customers that enables them to select the best product from the merchants catalog. Like PersonaLogic, Firefly <ref> [11, 34] </ref> helps consumers find products. However, instead of filtering products based on features, Firefly recommends products via a word of mouth recommendation mechanism called automated collaborative filtering (ACF). ACF first compares a shoppers product ratings with those of other shoppers. <p> From the notion of software agency [25, 26] and cognitive models [27, 28, 29] to extracting meaning from ambiguous Web pages [30, 30], from planning trips to Hawaii [32, 33] to learning users music preferences <ref> [34, 11] </ref>, from negotiating delivery contracts [35, 36, 37] to deciding on which car to buy [38, 39], AI technologies will continue to provide software agents with increased knowhow to successfully mediate electronic commerce transactions.

Reference-contexts: The system is currently used to recommend commodity products such as music and books. 2.3. Merchant Brokering Whereas the Product Brokering stage compares product alternatives, the Merchant Brokering stage compares merchant alternatives. Andersen Consultings BargainFinder was the first shopping agent for price comparisons <ref> [12] </ref>. Given a specific product, BargainFinder would request its price from each of nine different merchant Web sites using the same HTTP request as a web browser. Although a limited proof-of-concept system, Bargain-Finder offered valuable insights into the issues involved in price comparison in the online world.

Reference-contexts: However, it was also the case that Andersen Consulting received requests from an equal number of little-known merchants who wanted to be included in Bar-gainFinders price comparison. In short, companies competing on price wanted to be included, the others didnt. Jango <ref> [13, 30] </ref> can be viewed as an advanced Bar-gainFinder. Jango solves the merchant blocking issue by having the product requests originate from each consumers web browser instead of from a central site as in BargainFinder.

This was important for user acceptance as observed in a recent Media Lab experiment <ref> [14] </ref>. A larger Kasbah experiment is now underway at MIT allowing students to transact books, music, and Magic Cards [15]. Tete-a-Tete [24] provides a unique negotiation approach to retail sales.

Reference-contexts: In general, real-world negotiations accrue transaction costs that may be too high for either consumers or merchants. Fortunately, many of these impediments disappear in the digital world. For example, OnSale <ref> [16] </ref> and eBays AuctionWeb [17] are two popular web sites that sell retail and secondhand products using a choice of auction protocols. Unlike auction houses, these sites do not require that parties be geographically co-located (only virtually co-located).

Reference: [18] <institution> AuctionBot URL: &lt;http:auction.eecs.umich.edu&gt; </institution>
Reference-contexts: However, these sites still require that consumers manage their own negotiation strategies over an extended period of time. This is where agent technologies come in. Table 1 shows several agent systems that assist the customer in negotiating the terms of a transaction: AuctionBot, Kasbah, and Tete-a-Tete. AuctionBot <ref> [18] </ref> is a classified ad Internet auction server at the University of Michigan. ActionBot users can create new auctions to sell products by choosing from a selection of auction types and then specifying parameters for that auction (e.g., auction time, reserved price, etc.).
Reference: [19] <institution> OnSale Exchange URL: &lt;http://www.onsale.com/ exchange.htm&gt; </institution>
Reference-contexts: Once the auction is created, the seller s negotiation is completely automated by the system as defined by the auctioneer protocols and parameters of the selected auction. As in OnSale Exchange <ref> [19] </ref>, AuctionBot buyers can place bids for secondhand products according to the protocols of a given auction. What makes AuctionBot different, however, is that it provides an application programmable interface (API) for users to create their own software agents to autonomously compete in the AuctionBot marketplace.

Reference-contexts: Such an API provides a semantically sound interface to the marketplace unlike the wrapper technologies discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.4. However, as with the Fishmarket Project <ref> [20, 21] </ref>, it is left to the users to encode their own bidding strategies.
