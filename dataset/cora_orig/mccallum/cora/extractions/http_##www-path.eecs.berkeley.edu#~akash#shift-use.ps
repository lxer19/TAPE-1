Title: The Use of SHIFT in System Design  
Author: Akash Deshpande, Pravin Varaiya

Affiliation: California PATH and Dept. of EECS University of California,  
Abstract: Shift is a programming language for describing dynamic networks of hybrid automata. Such systems consist of components which can be created, interconnected and destroyed as the system evolves. Components exhibit hybrid behavior, consisting of continuous-time phases separated by discrete-event transitions. Components may evolve independently, or they may interact through their inputs, outputs and exported events. The interaction network itself may evolve. This paper illustrates how SHIFT was used to analyze multiple merge junction automated highways for safety and efficiency by several design teams comprising graduate students, research engineers and faculty.

Reference-contexts: The highway is approximately modeled after the HOV portion of the Katy Corridor (Interstate Highway 10) of the Houston metropolitan region. Figure 1 shows the overall layout of the highway being studied. We studied several travel demand characteristics taken from projections made by the Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority. <ref> [1] </ref> We used the origin-destination travel demand [6] derived from this data. The high intensity travel demand is shown in Table 1. We ensured that new vehicles would not enter the highway in an unsafe configuration in case of congestion.

Reference-contexts: The main result was that for simultaneous safe and efficient operations of autonomous automated vehicles the desired time headway must be linked to the travel demand on the highway segment. Complete description of this case study is given in <ref> [2] </ref> and [3]. In this case study, we examined a single lane freeway with three merge junctions. The highway is approximately modeled after the HOV portion of the Katy Corridor (Interstate Highway 10) of the Houston metropolitan region.

Reference-contexts: Our primary application was the specification and analysis of different designs for automatic control of vehicles and highway systems [15]. We needed to capture the behavior of vehicles, sensors, actuators, communication devices and controllers in a structured and modular 1 Research supported by California PATH Program specification <ref> [8] </ref>. Models for these components are provided by different groups of experts and then integrated in different ways for comparative analysis. Since spatial relationships between vehicles change as they move, our application is characterized by a dynamically changing network of interactions between system components.
