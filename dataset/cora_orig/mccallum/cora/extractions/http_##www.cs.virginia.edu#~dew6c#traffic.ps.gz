Abstract: A network that offers deterministic, i.e., worst-case, quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees to variable-bit-rate (VBR) video must provide a resource reservation mechanism that allocates bandwidth, buffer space, and other resources for each video connection. Such a resource reservation scheme must be carefully designed, otherwise network resources are wasted. A key issue for the design of a resource reservation scheme is the selection of a traffic characterization that specifies the traffic arrivals on a video connection. The traffic characterization should accurately describe the actual arrivals so that a large number of connections can be supported, but it must also map directly into efficient traffic policing mechanisms that monitor arrivals on each connection. In this study, we present a fast and accurate traffic characterization method for stored VBR video in networks with a deterministic service. Our characterization approach approximates the so-called empirical envelope of a video sequence. We use this approximation to obtain a traffic characterization that can be efficiently policed by a small number of leaky buckets. We present a case study where we apply our characterization method to networks that employ a dynamic resource reservation scheme with renegotiation. We use traces from a set of 25-30 minute MPEG sequences to evaluate our method against other characterization schemes from the literature. fl This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. NCR-9309224.

Reference-contexts: Following, in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3, we present and evaluate the new 6 solution approach to VBR video characterization. 3.1 The Empirical Envelope E fl The tightest traffic constraint function for a given traffic source is its empirical envelope, denoted by E fl <ref> [2, 33] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 33]: <p> fl <ref> [2, 33] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 33]: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (7) Note from equation (7) that E fl is subadditive. The following method presented in [33] obtains the empirical envelope of a given video sequence consisting of N frames with fixed inter-frame time r.

Reference-contexts: Pancha and El Zarki [24] choose parameters by fixing the burstiness parameter according to available buffer space, while the choice of (; ) in [3] depends on the relative availability of unallocated bandwidth and buffer space. An approach discussed by Guillemin et. al. in <ref> [14] </ref> assigns relative importance parameters ff and fi to buffer space and bandwidth, respectively; the pair (; ) is selected to minimize the quantity ff fi . <p> A drawback of all of these methods is that they do not strive for high network utilization as a design goal. Also, all of these approaches consider the selection of parameters for only a single leaky bucket mechanism. Guillemin et. al. present two heuristic algorithms in <ref> [14] </ref> that select a leaky bucket pair (; ) to approximate an "ideal" probabilistic traffic characterization, the so-called time* quantile function M * (t) associated with a source. <p> Assuming that N t is a 5 random variable specifying the number of packets generated over any interval of length t, a func-tion M * (t) is used to specify with probability 1 * the maximum traffic arrivals n in any interval of length t <ref> [14, 30] </ref>: M * (t) = inf fn; P rfN t ng *g (6) The quantity M * (t)=t specifies the rate of the video sequence over multiple time scales t. <p> The first heuristic in <ref> [14] </ref> selects a leaky bucket parameter ( + t) such that the maximum difference between M * (t)=t and the "normalized" leaky bucket curve ( + t)=t is minimized. <p> The second heuristic minimizes the area y between the normalized curves M * (t)=t and ( + t)=t over an interval [0; T 0 ]. As noted in <ref> [14] </ref>, the selection of parameters for the second heuristic is heavily dependent on the choice of T 0 which is not set explicitly in the paper. <p> Also, the computational complexity of the characterization algorithms was substantial. Here we present a method to obtain VBR video traffic characterizations that can be policed by a small, fixed number of leaky buckets. The computational complexity our our method is low and efficient as compared to the methods in <ref> [14, 33] </ref>. In Subsection 3.1 we discuss the tradeoffs of traffic characterization methods that are based on the empirical envelope. <p> The parameters selected by the concave hull approach are the m pairs from HE fl that have the smallest bursts, that is, the pairs f (^ j ; ^ j ) j j = 1; : : : ; mg.

Reference-contexts: A deterministic service requires a deterministic traffic characterization that provides an upper bound on traffic arrivals. Deterministic traffic characterizations have been used in previous work to support both deterministic and probabilistic QoS guarantees <ref> [6, 8, 16, 25, 33] </ref>. <p> Finally, we wish to add that admission control tests for QoS networks generally assume that traffic constraint functions are both time-invariant and subadditive <ref> [6, 21, 25] </ref>. In the following, we call a traffic constraint function A fl for A viable if it satisfies both equations (1) and (2). Practical traffic characterizations are obtained from a parameterized traffic model which expresses the arrivals admitted on a connection by some policing mechanism.

Reference-contexts: While admission control functions require that traffic characterizations are accurate in describing the worst-case traffic, traffic policing mechanisms that monitor in real time if the traffic submitted to the network conforms to its traffic characterization require a simple traffic characterization <ref> [26] </ref>. Therefore, the choice of traffic characterization method is a tradeoff between the high accuracy preferred by admission control tests and the simplicity required for implementing traffic policing mechanisms. An important class of traffic characterizations describes the worst-case traffic on a connection in terms of a piecewise-linear function [15]. <p> If the resulting function is concave, the traffic characterization can be implemented with a set of leaky buckets 1 [6], one for each linear segment of the function. Since a leaky bucket can be implemented with a single counter and a single timer <ref> [26] </ref>, leaky buckets seem to satisfy the need for simple traffic characterizations. In a previous study [33], we showed that concave piecewise-linear functions ("leaky buckets") are capable of accurately characterizing VBR video traffic. However, the number of leaky buckets needed for an accurate characterization was shown to be large.

In Subsection 3.1 we discuss the tradeoffs of traffic characterization methods that are based on the empirical envelope. <p> Following, in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3, we present and evaluate the new 6 solution approach to VBR video characterization. 3.1 The Empirical Envelope E fl The tightest traffic constraint function for a given traffic source is its empirical envelope, denoted by E fl <ref> [2, 33] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 33]: <p> fl <ref> [2, 33] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 33]: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (7) Note from equation (7) that E fl is subadditive. The following method presented in [33] obtains the empirical envelope of a given video sequence consisting of N frames with fixed inter-frame time r. <p> The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 33]: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (7) Note from equation (7) that E fl is subadditive. The following method presented in <ref> [33] </ref> obtains the empirical envelope of a given video sequence consisting of N frames with fixed inter-frame time r. We assume that frames are fragmented into 53-byte ATM cells with a payload of 48 bytes each, and these cells are transmitted at equally-spaced intervals over the frame time r. <p> If the sequence of frame sizes of a video sequence is given by ff 1 ; f 2 ; : : : ; f N g, then the empirical envelope E fl can be constructed by calculating <ref> [33] </ref>: E fl (ir) = max k+i1 X f j for i = 1; 2; : : : N (8) Note that equation (8) defines N parameters fE fl (ir) j 1 i N g for the empirical envelope, where E fl (r) is equal to the largest frame in the <p> Since the empirical envelope E fl does not conform to a parameterized traffic model, it is difficult to police.

However, the empirical envelope requires a large number of parameters, that is, one parameter per frame in the sequence. <p> Note that HR fl k can be expressed in terms of the (~; ~) model as follows: HR fl n = min f i + i tg; (11) where parameters i and i are determined by some appropriate algorithm to compute the concave hull of a function, e.g. <ref> [33] </ref>. 3 Note that equation (9) only defines E fl k for times that are multiples of the frame time r. <p> We set f ixed = 1000 cells since this choice yields better empirical performance. We also add a cell-spacer to enforce the peak rate peak of the connection. (d) Concave hull: The concave hull approach in <ref> [33] </ref> selects m (^; ^) pairs for traffic characterization that are taken directly from the concave hull of the empirical envelope HE fl . <p> However, the poor performance is not due to the fact that only two leaky buckets are used, but rather to a poor selection of leaky bucket parameters. Using a better heuristic algorithm such as the one developed in this paper, one can achieve markedly higher performance. * In <ref> [33] </ref>, the numerical examples indicated that a large number of leaky bucket pairs were needed to approximate the empirical envelope. Using our method, the number of leaky buckets needed to achieve performance similar to the envelope is small. This discrepancy can 24 be explained as follows. <p> Using our method, the number of leaky buckets needed to achieve performance similar to the envelope is small.

Reference-contexts: In a network that employs renegotiation, traffic characterizations are occasionally modified to exploit long-term traffic variations of the VBR video traffic source, possibly leading to increased network utilization <ref> [4, 13, 34] </ref>. Since a renegotiation scheme requires multiple traffic characterizations for a single connection, a fast traffic characterization scheme such as the one described in this paper can be used to renegotiate traffic parameters. <p> Most renegotiation schemes that have been proposed attempt to renegotiate the traffic characterization of a connection whenever its long-term rate changes significantly <ref> [4, 13, 34] </ref>. Chong et. al. address the problem of predicting the rate changes of a live video source [4]. They consider both a recursive least-square method and an artificial neural network approach for the prediction. <p> They present algorithms for partitioning a video sequence into segments based on cost functions for both bandwidth allocation and number of renegotiations. Zhang and Knightly study a renegotiated VBR service for both stored and live video in <ref> [34] </ref>. Their algorithm for stored video proceeds by identifying the worst-case segment of the video sequence, characterizing this worst-case segment, and then iteratively repeating the procedure on the remaining video sequence after this worst-case segment is removed.
