Title: Boolean Formalism and Explanations  
Author: Eric C. R. Hehner

Abstract: Boolean algebra is simpler than number algebra, with applications in programming, circuit design, law, specifications, mathematical proof, and reasoning in any domain. So why is number algebra taught in primary school and used routinely by scientists, engineers, economists, and the general public, while boolean algebra is not taught until university, and not routinely used by anyone? A large part of the answer may be in the terminology of logic, in the symbols used, and in the explanations of boolean algebra found in textbooks. The subject has not yet freed itself from its history and philosophy. This paper points out the problems delaying the acceptance and use of boolean algebra, and suggests some solutions.
