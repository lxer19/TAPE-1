Reference-contexts: The nonmonotonic logic employed here is causal logic in the sense of <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1997 ] </ref> . (That paper extends the system of [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] . It is available at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/mypapers/ causal.ps). The postulates of a causal theory are rules of the form F G, where F and G are formulas. <p> It can be proved that the new causal theory TEC 0 is equivalent to TEC . On the other hand, this theory is "definite," so that the literal completion method ( [ McCain and Turner, 1997 ] , <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1997 ] </ref> ) is applicable to it. We can prove theorems in TEC by deriving them in classical logic from the completion sentences for TEC 0 .
