Title: right angled component C (Stability) Given an assembly in a given orientation, is the assembly
Date: 3  
Note: The same is true for component C  Problem 1:  C 2 C 1  
Abstract: 1 . For the moment, let us ignore frictional forces. C 1 is firmly attached to a gripper, as indicated in the figure by the ground symbol. The vector g indicates the direction of a uniform gravity field. In the orientation shown in Figure 1(a), the assembly is unstable under the inuence of gravity. Gravitational forces produce a downward translational motion on component C 2 which causes component C 3 to translate towards the right. Is there an orientation of the assembly in which it is gravitationally stable? The orientation shown in Figure 1(b) is a stable one. The gravitational force on component C 2 is balanced by the internal contact forces exerted by the other two components. In this paper, we address the problem of the stability of a collection of contacting objects, acted upon by a uniform external gravity field. One (or more) of the objects is assumed to be fixed in a gripper. All the objects are assumed to be rigid and frictionless. Under these assumptions, we In the first problem, if we find that the assembly is unstable, we would also like to know which parts in the assembly will have motion and in what direction. This can be used either to redesign parts or provide fixtures during assembly. Figure 1: (a) An assembly that is gravitationally unstable. (b) The assembly in an orientation that makes it gravitationally stable. C 1 C 2 High level assembly plans prescribe the sequence in which parts come together along with their motions. At each stage of assembly the stability of subassemblies is an important concern. In this paper we address the problem of gravitational stability of assemblies of frictionless rigid bodies. Solution methods to the problems of determining if an assembly is stable, and finding a stable orientation for a given assembly are proposed. The solution methods for the two problems compute constrained motions of individual parts that decrease gravitational potential energy, in order to determine stability and search for stable orientations. Linear programming is used to obtain numerical solutions. The problem of finding a stable orientation is formulated as a maximin problem. The solution to this problem is the first general method for automatically determining stable orientations. The program to solve the two problems takes as input a geometric model of the assembly and information related to grounding constraints. Preliminary results are presented. solve the following problems:

Reference-contexts: Palmer showed that the potential stability problem is in P, while the infinitesimal stability problem is NP-hard. The complexity of the infinitesimal stability problem is solely a consequence of ill-defined surface normals at contact points, for example, vertex-to-vertex contact. Following Baraff <ref> [1] </ref>, our method disallows degenerate contact geometry by imagining a local extension of the contact surface in order to generate a well-defined surface normal. One approach to determine stability is to model the interaction between parts in an assembly in terms of unknown forces. <p> This is a significant shortcoming since loops occur quite frequently in assemblies. In section 2.2 we shall compare our formulation with that of Boneschanscher et al.s and argue that their inability to handle loops is a fundamental problem of the method. Baraff <ref> [1] </ref> presents a method to analytically calculate forces between systems of frictionless rigid bodies in resting contact. At each point of contact, an unknown repulsive normal force exists. The normal forces must be strong enough to prevent interpenetration while at the same time being workless. <p> Additionally, the impending motion is indicated by the acceleration. This method differs from Boneschanscher et al.s in that it can be used to solve the infinitesimal instability problem for frictionless systems with loops. 1.2 Approach Outline Our method to solve the stability problem follows similar lines to Baraff <ref> [1] </ref>. However, instead of taking a vectorial approach by solving for forces, we adopt the Lagrangian approach and solve for part motions. We formulate an expression for the change in potential energy of a system of bodies subject to a given virtual displacement. <p> Otherwise, z &lt; 0 so U can be decreased and the system is unstable. (Note that the displacements which minimize z only approximately indicate the impending motion. Computation of the exact impending motion requires a method such as that used in Baraff <ref> [1] </ref>.) Solutions to some test cases using the above linear program are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. dp i dU 0&lt; dp i a dp i ( ) dp i minimize z m i g dr i i 1= -= subjectto dr i i dr 0and dq 0= =

Reference-contexts: One approach to determine stability is to model the interaction between parts in an assembly in terms of unknown forces. Potential stability for systems with friction can be determined by attempting to find a set of forces that produces equilibrium. Blum, Griffith, and Neumann <ref> [3] </ref> implemented a potential stability test based on linear programming that searches for such a solution. The analysis begins by assuming that the assembly in question is stable.
