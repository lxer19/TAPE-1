Abstract: The growing availability of Internet access has led to a sharp increase in the use of the World Wide Web(WWW). In the near future, a significant component of the Internet traffic into and out of the home is expected to be WWW related traffic. If we are to design broadband access systems to carry this traffic, it is important to be able to model it accurately, with the hope that we can track and predict the impact of this relatively new type of traffic. The upstream packets presented by a subscriber engaged in a web browsing session, cannot be modelled as an independant one-way source since the actual inter-arrival between the packets depends on the feedback mechanisms and restrictions imposed by the transport/application layer protocols. We need to model the complete packet exchange between the WWW Client/Server to generate realistic source traffic for such systems. In this paper we report statistics on different parameters of the WWW browsing session obtained from actual WWW traces. We also present empirically derived analytical models for the different parameters . The statistical characterization of the different parameters directly lends itself to the development of a more realistic WWW-browser packet generator the basic details of which are addressed in this paper. This WWW traffic generator will be very useful in testing the performance of media access protocols and resource reservation algorithms in broadband access networks.

Reference-contexts: Our particular focus in this paper is understanding the packet level interaction between a WWW client and a remote Web server. To this end, we have developed a WWW client traffic analysis tool, which uses trace data from the tcpdump <ref> [4] </ref> program, and extracts information on different parameters of the web browsing session. A significant amount of work done in the past has concentrated on modeling aggregate Web Traffic [5,6,7,10,11,12].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The World Wide Web (WWW) is a distributed information retrieval system overlaying the Internet. Using a WWW client (browser), any user connected to the Internet, can retrieve vast amounts of information, stored on different remote computers all around the world. Internet traffic statistics <ref> [8] </ref>, indicate that WWW traffic accounts for more than 25% of the Internet traffic, and is currently growing more rapidly than any other Internet traffic type. In the early days of the Web, most communication was between researchers. <p> The mean number of segments for the main document is 8.3 [9] with a median value of 4. The mean number of segments for the inline object is 7.27 <ref> [8] </ref> with a median of 3. The inlined objects tend to be slightly smaller as they are usually compressed image files used for the icons in a web page as compared to the uncompressed ASCII HTML file (main object). <p> Parameter Mean Median Stddev Model Distribution Connection setup (rtt) time 0.001257 secs 0.001252 secs 0.0003032 Local component: Normal T connect 0.09392 secs 0.0733 secs 0.0727 Wide area component:Log normal Reqsize 324 bytes 299 bytes 84.9 Log normal N umsegs (main) 8.3 [9] 4 11.82 Log normal N umsegs (inline) 7.26 <ref> [8] </ref> 3 16.52 T parse 0.1484 secs 0.0642 secs 0.2102 gamma N uminline 1.902 [2] 0 3.965 gamma T v iew (think) 21.0396 secs 9.8405 secs 29.0784 Wei bull Table 1: Summary of models for the HTTP transaction parameters The state transition diagram of a synthetic WWW traffic generator that could

Reference-contexts: It has been recently shown [11] that aggregate WWW traffic exhibits self similarity, which has been inferred from the underlying distributions of the WWW document sizes, the effect of user "think time" and superposition of many such transfers in a local area network. In <ref> [10] </ref>, work has been done in deriving an empirical model for the document arrival process at an access link. This empirical model only characterizes the arrivals of the HTTP document-requests at an access link, ignoring the short TCP/IP control packets in between these document requests. <p> Such short TCP control packets will be the major component of the upstream traffic presented by the WWW client source to the broadband access network. We believe that the source model proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>, along with information on the requested object size is useful for testing resource reservation algorithms at the Head-End with a contention free upstream channel 3 .

TCP Data Segments N umsegs The actual file sizes of WWW documents have been shown to belong to a heavy tailed distribution like a Pareto distribution in <ref> [11] </ref> . For the purpose of packet exchange we measure the number of data packets (tcp segments) that were sent by the server to the client in response to a document request. This helps in estimating the number of acks sent out by the client.

Reference-contexts: A significant amount of work done in the past has concentrated on modeling aggregate Web Traffic [5,6,7,10,11,12]. Related work is being carried out by Mah <ref> [13] </ref> at the University of California at Berkeley. The paper begins with an overview of a typical web page retrieval process in section 2. Sec 2 tion 3 provides a brief summary of the WWW traffic modeling work done in the past. <p> However absence of the short and frequent control packets in the source results in gross underestimation of the actual load on the contention channel of a cable modem when such a model is used for testing the performance of media access control protocols. Mah <ref> [13] </ref> presents empirical statistics on some of the parameters discussed in this paper. However no modeling of these parameters is done. Our work reported in this paper is a more detailed study of the packet exchange in an HTTP transaction.

Reference-contexts: Most cable-based residential broadband access networks, use a contention based reservation scheme for the upstream channel. Each active station on the network needs to contend for the upstream channel in order to make a reservation request <ref> [14] </ref>. The actual packets are then sent on the upstream channel when the request has been granted by the bandwidth controller.
