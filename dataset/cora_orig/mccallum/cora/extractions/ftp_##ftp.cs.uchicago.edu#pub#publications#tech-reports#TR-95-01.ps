Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Determining the relative size of denumerable sets, and those with cardinal-ity @ 1 , led mathematicians do develop the notions of measure and category [Oxt71]. Described in this report is an application of measure and category techniques to a branch of learning theory called inductive inference <ref> [AS83] </ref>. The models of learning used in this field have been inspired by features of human learning. The goal of this work is to determine the relative sizes of set theoretically incomparable classes of inferrible sets of functions.

Reference-contexts: Each IIM M will learn an undecidable set of recursive functions denoted by EX (M ). EX is used to denote the collection of all such sets as M varies across IIMs. A common example of a set in EX is the set of so called self describing functions <ref> [Bar74, BB75] </ref>. For these functions, if x is the least number such that f (x) 6= 0, then ' x = f .

An inductive inference machine (IIM) is an algorithmic device that inputs the graph of a recursive function and, while doing so, outputs a sequence of computer programs. <p> Typically, an IIM M learns a recursive function f , if M , when given the graph of f as input, outputs a sequence a of programs that converges to a program that computes f . The order in which the input arrives does not effect the learnability <ref> [BB75] </ref>. Each IIM M will learn an undecidable set of recursive functions denoted by EX (M ).

Reference-contexts: The collection of all the sets EX n (M ) as M varies over IIMs is denoted by EX n . Another commonly studied restriction on learning algorithms is to demand 4 that they only produce as conjectures programs for total recursive functions. Such IIMs are called Popperian (see <ref> [CS83] </ref>). The resultant class of learnable sets of functions is denoted by P EX. One way to expand the class of functions being learned is to have more algorithms involved in the learning. The notion of team inference defined in [Smi82] and generalized in [OSW86].
