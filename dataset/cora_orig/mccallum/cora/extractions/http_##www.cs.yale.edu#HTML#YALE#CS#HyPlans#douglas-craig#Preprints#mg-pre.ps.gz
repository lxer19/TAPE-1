Abstract: A more difficult case occurs when a highly unstructured grid problem is to be solved with no hints how the grid was produced. Here, there may be no natural multigrid structure and applying such a solver may be quite difficult to do. Since unstructured grids play a vital role in scientific computing, many modifications have been proposed in order to apply a fast, robust multigrid solver. One suggested solution is to map the unstructured grid onto a structured grid and then apply multigrid to a sequence of structured grids as a preconditioner. In this paper, we derive both general upper and lower bounds on the condition number of this procedure in terms of computable grid parameters. We provide examples to illuminate when this preconditioner is a useful (e.g., p or h-p formulated finite element problems on semi-structured grids) or should be avoided (e.g., typical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or boundary layer problems). We show that unless great care is taken, this mapping can lead to a system with a high condition number which eliminates the advantage of the multigrid method.

Reference-contexts: In [4], P 1 conforming finite elements are used to construct optimal precon-ditioners for higher order finite elements. The conforming finite elements are shown to provide optimal preconditioners in the case where the underlying grids are the same. In <ref> [2] </ref>, the authors discuss a method for using a coarse grid for preconditioning a finer grid, assuming that the auxiliary problem is conforming. As has been shown in [10], the method can be applied to obtain an optimal preconditioner in a large number of cases.

Reference-contexts: An alternate approach is taken by Brenner in <ref> [4] </ref>. Optimal preconditioners are produced using the same underlying grid. For complicated finite elements, lower order, less complicated finite elements that are related to the original ones are used. The problems raised in this paper do not appear simply as a result of not changing the grid. <p> In this case the problem is normally mapped to an auxiliary space which uses lower dimensional basis elements. As a result the explosive growth in the condition number, arising from the mapping process, is not seen. In <ref> [4] </ref>, P 1 conforming finite elements are used to construct optimal precon-ditioners for higher order finite elements. The conforming finite elements are shown to provide optimal preconditioners in the case where the underlying grids are the same.

Reference-contexts: These methods are critically dependent on the presence of natural multilevel structures in the domain. A well known folk theorem is the following: In the case of unstructured grids multigrid methods are not, in general, conveniently applicable since this natural structure is not available. In <ref> [7] </ref>, multigrid for CFD problems based on unstructured grids is described for a particular class of problems, namely, the simulation of airflow over a foil. Multigrid on unstructured grids is reported to be only a factor of 3 slower than on a highly structured grid on a vector supercomputer.

Reference-contexts: Multigrid on unstructured grids is reported to be only a factor of 3 slower than on a highly structured grid on a vector supercomputer. This is based on years of work at NASA to make the multigrids code run fast on this class of computer. An approach suggested in <ref> [10] </ref> is the creation of a single auxiliary grid to which the error can be transferred from the unstructured grid. This is the first approach anyone implementing domain decomposition methods would think of, possibly resulting in locally uniform meshes with small mesh spacings. <p> This is solely due to interpolation errors when mapping data between grids. The error in transferring the residual onto the auxiliary grid can eliminate the advantages of fast convergence on the uniform grid. In <ref> [10] </ref>, a general method is developed and analyzed. All of the examples contained there assume a nearly structured grid which is mapped onto a similar, but structured grid. The primary theorem in [10] requires that certain expressions be constants. <p> In <ref> [10] </ref>, a general method is developed and analyzed.

For general problems (even many quite simple ones), these expressions are not all constants. In this paper, we relax certain assumptions slightly to allow much more general problems to be analyzed. Some of the examples in [10] are usually solved on the multigrid grids using lower order basis functions than the original problem. This reduces the condition number of the preconditioned system and would in practice reduce the complexity for the running time of the preconditioner. <p> In x4, we provide numerical experiments based on the examples of x3. In x5, we draw some concrete conclusions about the usefulness of this preconditioner. 2 Auxiliary space method: an abstract framework. In this section, we follow the exposition and notation of <ref> [10] </ref> closely. The method suggested is a general scheme based on a relaxation scheme and an auxiliary space. The method is normally a two level nonnested multigrid pre-conditioner. <p> See <ref> [10, Thm 2.1] </ref> for a proof of (2.8). Now we prove (2.9), which is new. <p> However, for the case where the grids are somewhat similar we find that the condition number grows quite slowly as a function of k. In fact, for values of k that might be used in practice, the condition number remains relatively constant. 5 Conclusions. Although the method suggested in <ref> [10] </ref> can be applied in a variety of situations, great care must be taken in the application of the method. <p> The conforming finite elements are shown to provide optimal preconditioners in the case where the underlying grids are the same. In [2], the authors discuss a method for using a coarse grid for preconditioning a finer grid, assuming that the auxiliary problem is conforming. As has been shown in <ref> [10] </ref>, the method can be applied to obtain an optimal preconditioner in a large number of cases. In particular, when the grids involved are nearly structured, as are all of the examples presented in [10], the process of mapping one grid to the other is a fairly well conditioned process. <p> As has been shown in <ref> [10] </ref>, the method can be applied to obtain an optimal preconditioner in a large number of cases.
