Abstract: Supervised classification problems have received considerable attention from the machine learning community. We propose a novel genetic algorithm based prototype learning system, PLEASE, for this class of problems. Given a set of prototypes for each of the possible classes, the class of an input instance is determined by the prototype nearest to this instance. We assume ordinal attributes and prototypes are represented as sets of feature-value pairs. A genetic algorithm is used to evolve the number of prototypes per class and their positions on the input space as determined by corresponding feature-value pairs. Comparisons with C4.5 on a set of artificial problems of controlled complexity demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro posed system.

Reference-contexts: Representations used in subsymbolic systems include networks of simple computational units connected by weighted links and bit strings. In addition to these mainstream machine learning approaches, there exists a significant body of work on statistical induction schemes <ref> [ Breiman et al., 1984; Cheese-man et al., 1988 ] </ref> . Other researchers have been motivated by the findings of cognitive psychologists [ Schaffer, 1978; Smith and Medin, 1981 ] and are using exemplar-based classification schemes [ Aha et al., 1991; Kruschke, 1992; Stanfill and Waltz, 1986 ] . <p> We have used the cross validation error estimation technique <ref> [ Breiman et al., 1984 ] </ref> for evaluating the performance of the algorithms on the problem set. For each of the problems, 1000 points were randomly generated from the input space and classified according to the region from which it was drawn.

The other form of concept representation that has been commonly posited by cognitive scientists as a theory of human concept learning is that of prototypes [ Reed, 1972; Smith, 1989 ] . A prototype is a collection of salient features of a concept.

Reference-contexts: These domain-independent classification mechanisms are particularly useful in problem domains for which there is no known precise model to determine the class, or for which determining a precise model is impractical. There are two principal schools of thought in designing GBML systems <ref> [ DeJong, 1990 ] </ref> . The first school of researchers proposes to use genetic algorithms to evolve individual rules, a collection of which comprises the classification expertise of the system.
