Title: Causation, Explanation and Persistence

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to reasoning about action and change using nonmonotonic logic. The approach is arrived at by applying Pearl's theory of causal networks to logical formalizations of temporal reasoning domains. It comes in two versions: version S 0 that works for logical theories in which causal knowledge is represented explicitly, and version I 0 that works for logical theories in which this is not the case. We show that various restrictions of S 0 are equivalent to various existing approaches that are explicitly based on causation. For most other existing causation-based approaches, we give examples of reasoning domains that S 0 handles better than they do. In a similar manner we show that two of the most well-known non-causal approaches, namely Baker's account and `chronological minimization with filter preferential entailment', can be reinterpreted as approximations of I 0 . We thus provide a reinterpretation in terms of causal network theory of much of the work done in non monotonic temporal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show by the technique used in <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> that models with :Ho (Alive; s) are not preferred above models with Ho (Alive; s); this is because no counterfactual situation exists in which the Point-action does not take place.

Reference-contexts: We have proven that some recent causal and `action description language'-based approaches are equivalent to various restrictions of S 0 specifically, we proved equivalences between restricted versions of S 0 and the approaches of McCain and Turner [1995] and Baral and Gelfond's L 3 <ref> [ Baral et al., 1995 ] </ref> ; also, we have made an informal comparison that makes clear that Lin's recent approach [ Lin, 1995; 1996 ] is largely identical to S 0 . <p> Next we compare S 0 to two ADL approaches: Baral and Gelfond's L 3 <ref> [ Baral et al., 1995 ] </ref> and McCain and Turner's [1995] Theory of Ramifications and Qualifications. <p> Baral and Gelfond's L 3 and S 0 Baral and Gelfond's approach <ref> [ Baral et al., 1995 ] </ref> which is based on their ADL L 3 , consists of domain descriptions D written in L 3 .

Reference-contexts: All other problems with Baker's approach we are aware of, like the `extended stolen car problem', the `two-tank problem' <ref> [ Crawford and Etherington, 1992 ] </ref> and the general problem of handling actions with nondeterministic effects [ Sandewall and Shoham, 1995 ] can be seen to stem from either this narrow definition of counterfactual situations or from the fact that Baker uses a single pred icate Ab to denote both causation

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, in recent years there have been a number of papers on the use of directed acyclic graphs for the modeling of causal relations; the theory of these `causal networks' is successfully applied in several domains <ref> [ Darwiche and Pearl, 1994; Pearl, 1996 ] </ref> . We will call the view on causation that is implied by these networks `Pearl's account of Causation' as it is mainly associated with J. Pearl's writings. <p> The extension is entirely straightforward however. The fact that we have to make such an extension explains the many differences between our approach and earlier connections between causal networks and nonmonotonic temporal reasoning <ref> [ Darwiche and Pearl, 1994 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: But whereas for our approach these are the only ones, MAT also selects the models with Ho (Steady; 0) ^ Ho (Fall; 1)! We add here without going into detail that Geffner's causal model selection <ref> [ Geffner, 1990 ] </ref> also gives the unintended model in the example above. 8.2 ADL Approaches From our point of view, both the recent ADL approaches and Sandewall's `systematic' approach [ Sandewall and Shoham, 1995 ] are to be classified among the causal approaches, since they too, are based on explicitly

Reference-contexts: For the other existing causal approaches specifically, those of Mor-genstern and Stein [1988], Geffner [1990] and Lifschitz, Haugh and Rabinov <ref> [ Haugh, 1987; Lifschitz and Rabi-nov, 1989 ] </ref> we give examples of reasoning domains where our approach gives better results than they do. For some of the non-causal approaches, we argue that they can be interpreted as implementing an approximation of I 0 .

Reference-contexts: It turns out that one can reformulate S 0 in the form of an equivalent two-step circumscription procedure. This then allows direct comparison of S 0 to the two main existing circumscriptive causal approaches, causal minimization <ref> [ Lifschitz and Rabinov, 1989 ] </ref> and Lin's embrace of causality [ Lin, 1996 ] .

Reference-contexts: As first noticed by Ginsberg, <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1990 ] </ref> sometimes such a constraint axiom is meant to yield indirect effects (ramifications) while sometimes it should yield action preconditions (qualifications). We will now give an example (inspired by McCain & Turner [1995]).

Reference-contexts: various restrictions of S 0 specifically, we proved equivalences between restricted versions of S 0 and the approaches of McCain and Turner [1995] and Baral and Gelfond's L 3 [ Baral et al., 1995 ] ; also, we have made an informal comparison that makes clear that Lin's recent approach <ref> [ Lin, 1995; 1996 ] </ref> is largely identical to S 0 .

Reference-contexts: It turns out that one can reformulate S 0 in the form of an equivalent two-step circumscription procedure.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show that S 0 also deals properly with `pure' ramification and qualification constraints and with ramification constraints involving several preconditions (as in the `Emperor Problem' and the `Two Switches Problem' <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> ). 6.2 Nondeterministic Effects If we toss a coin, we would like to infer that after the Toss event, we can have either Heads or Not (Heads), independent of whether we had Heads or Not (Heads) before the tossing (thus there is no persistence). <p> MT define a function Res 4 C (E; S) such that it gives the set of possible states of the world after an action with effects E has taken place in state S. For the definition of Res 4 C (E; S) we refer to <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> ; here we just give an example of its use : S = fAlive; Walkingg E = f:Aliveg C = f:Alive ) :Walkingg In this case, Res 4 C (E; S) = ff:Alive; :Walkinggg i.e. the change of Alive brought about a change of Walking. <p> Suppose that two events happen, one causing the flue and the other causing a headache : S 2 = f:Flue; :Headache; :Nauseag E 2 = fFlue; Headacheg C 2 = fFlue ) (Headache _ Nausea)g It now follows directly from definition 4 in <ref> [ McCain and Turner, 1995 ] </ref> that Res 4 C 2 (E 2 ; S 2 ) = ffFlue; Headache; :Nauseagg We have the rather unintuitive conclusion that our patient is guaranteed not to get any nausea! Assuming that an additional event happened which directly causes a headache allows us to

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Any approach to common-sense temporal reasoning must address the frame problem <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> : how can one properly model the common sense intuition that most facts about the world tend to stay the same over time, unless an action takes place that affects them?

Reference-contexts: Note that this is a way of directly representing nondeterministic effects and thus considerably simpler than most earlier approaches to this problem <ref> [ Sandewall and Shoham, 1995 ] </ref> , in which Toss is interpreted as a set of deterministic actions Toss 1 with effect Heads and Toss 2 with effect Not (Heads) . 7 More About I 0 In this section we explain step 1 of I 0 in more detail. <p> with Ho (Steady; 0) ^ Ho (Fall; 1)!
