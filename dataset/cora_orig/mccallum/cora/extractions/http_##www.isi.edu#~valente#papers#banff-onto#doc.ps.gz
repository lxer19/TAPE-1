Abstract: An important issue in the newborn discipline of ontological engineering is the construction of libraries of ontologies which are designed for maximum reusability. Van Heijst et. al. suggested that a central part of ontology libraries is the definition of what they called a core ontology, containing elements that are as generic and method-independent as possible. However, their specification of how these core ontologies should be constructed is highly pragmatical, and leaves many problems unresolved. In this article we propose and discuss a number of specific principles for the construction of core ontologies. We demonstrate the advantages of these principles using as an example a core ontology we have built for the domain of law. Several conclusions about the construction of ontology libraries based on core ontologies are drawn.

Reference-contexts: However, this type of knowledge is distinct from (albeit connected to) normative knowledge | that is, primary norms describe an ideal world based on the description of reality. This separation between the knowledge used to describe the world and the normative knowledge was first explicitly proposed by Breuker <ref> (Breuker, 1990) </ref>, who called this category world knowledge. In addition to adopt the distinction of a category of legal knowledge which describes the world, we propose that this knowledge constitutes a structured model.

Reference-contexts: The domains are distinguished from their environment as "systems" (Hobbs, 1995). This distinction is the basis of behavioral or functional characteristics <ref> (Breuker, 1994) </ref>. Knowledge about such a domain, world or system becomes "a model of a system" (Clancey, 1985). There are two views on this (functional) model-like character of domain ontologies for knowledge acquisition. 12 The first one may coincide with philosophers' views on ontology.

Reference-contexts: A conceptualization thus also carries a set of ontological commitments. Elaborating conceptualizations (and thus selecting ontological commitments) is an essential component of the task of representing knowledge, because conceptualizations select which things are relevant to be represented and which are not <ref> (Davis et al., 1993) </ref>. Representing knowledge involves both the design of a knowledge representation language and the formulation of a specific set of sentences in this language which describe certain things in the world | such a set of sentences is usually called a knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, a central part of knowledge representation consists of elaborating a conceptualization: a set of abstract objects, concepts, and other entities which are assumed to exist in a certain domain, as well as the relations that may hold between them <ref> (Genesereth & Nilsson, 1987) </ref>. The commitments which are implied by the choice of one set of concepts instead of another to describe a certain phenomenon are called ontological commitments. A conceptualization thus also carries a set of ontological commitments.

Reference-contexts: Ontological commitments precede the elaboration of both the knowledge representation language and the knowledge base. A conceptualization is an abstract entity which is merely implied in a knowledge representation. An ontology is a specification of a conceptualization <ref> (Gruber, 1994) </ref>. An ontology comprises a description (e.g., through definitions) of the concepts, objects, relations, and so forth which make up a conceptualization. One of the basic roles of an ontology is to enable the study of conceptualizations and ontological commitments dissociated from the knowledge representations they may yield. <p> One strategy to cope with the indexing problem is to use the ontology terms (names) themselves as indexes. This was roughly the solution adopted by the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Initiative (Neches et al., 1991; Patil et al., 1992) and implemented in the Ontolingua Repository <ref> (Gruber, 1994) </ref>. The problem, of course, is that there is no guarantee that the same term is being used with the same meaning in different ontologies. <p> While these roles may all be subsumed under the term `knowledge sharing' <ref> (Gruber, 1994) </ref>, different purposes of (re)use of ontologies also put different requirements on the ontologies. 1. In the first place, rather than being directly related to building knowledge-based systems, ontologies may sometimes be used as repositories for organizing knowledge and information. <p> A second, related role is in knowledge acquisition, where teams have to work together and an ontology becomes a common, agreed-upon understanding of the terms in a domain, which can be read by team members with different background knowledge <ref> (Gruber, 1994) </ref>. 3. Ontologies make explicit the term conceptualizations to which a particular knowledge base is committed. In constructing a knowledge base one has to make commitments anyway, so making them explicit in an ontology enables more controlled development (and also maintenance) of a KBS. <p> directly 8 This decision is not arbitrary; on (Valente, 1995) we show why description logics are particularly adequate to represent and reason with world knowledge. 9 Direct, automatic translations between an ontology and a knowledge base may maintain structural similarity, e.g., class concepts in Ontolingua and the T-Box of LOOM <ref> (Gruber, 1994) </ref>. into knowledge base propositions. It should be noted that the definitions in a useful ontology are in general richer than what is to be used in the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Responsibility knowledge plays the role of linking causal connections with a responsibility connection | i.e., that connection which makes an agent accountable for a norm violation and possibly subject to legal reactions (see also Section 3.2.5). As <ref> (Hart & Honore, 1985) </ref> point out, however, responsibility does not have "any implication as to the type of factual connection between the person held responsible and the harm" | that is, causal connections are only a "non-tautologous ground or reason for saying that [an agent] is responsible" (Hart & Honore, 1985;

Reference-contexts: That is also the way many people outside (and even inside) AI think about the knowledge in and understanding of a knowledge system when they look under its hood. There is a general `Eliza effect' even in model-based, deep reasoning systems (see, e.g., <ref> (Hofstadter, 1995) </ref>). 3 However, as in cars, this "thinness" is the consequence of good engineering. Being parsimonious with the material has the advantage of easy processing and total economy.

Reference-contexts: In this ontology, we adopt the conceptualization that the definition of a standard is the central characteristic of normative knowledge, and the prescription of behavior is one of its effects. The basic conception of norm used in the ontology is largely derived from <ref> (Kelsen, 1991) </ref>. A norm expresses an idealization: what ought to be the case (or to happen), according to the will of the agent that created the norm.

Reference-contexts: The basis proposed for building such generic ontology varies. One group of researchers proposes that it should be based on natural language | that is, the top level terms should be natural language categories or roles of terms <ref> (Knight & Luk, 1994) </ref>. A second group, of which the CYC builders are and example, prefers to see the whole enterprise as an encyclopedia, and suggests the careful construction of what amounts to an ontology of commonsense knowledge (Lenat & Guha, 1990).

Reference-contexts: A second group, of which the CYC builders are and example, prefers to see the whole enterprise as an encyclopedia, and suggests the careful construction of what amounts to an ontology of commonsense knowledge <ref> (Lenat & Guha, 1990) </ref>. While these two groups share the same basic indexing strategy, their results are quite different. CYC-like ontologies are microtheories, which can be used for reasoning purposes by logical inferencing engines. <p> Indeed, since the law is supposed to be comprehensible to the people who are addressed by it, every concept used in legislation is supposed to be comprehensible to any person. That means these concepts are supposed to be part of this `consensus reality' mentioned by <ref> (Lenat & Guha, 1990) </ref> | that is, these terms are in fact supposed to be interpreted using commonsense knowledge.

Reference-contexts: These advantages were explored in designing the ON-LINE architecture for legal problem solving (Valente & Breuker, 1995). ON-LINE represents the functional ontology in the description logic/system LOOM <ref> (MacGregor, 1991) </ref>, and uses this representation to define specialized representations for objects in each of the categories of the ontology. However, the main advantage of using a principled core ontology as proposed in this paper appears when defining reasoning mechanisms. Different mechanisms are used to reason with each category.

Reference-contexts: To use Toulmin's terminology <ref> (Toulmin, 1969) </ref>, an ontology defines what types of conclusions, warrants and argument chains are commonly used and/or held valid. This may be an important factor if domain-specific reasoning is viewed as the production and evaluation of arguments (as it is indeed the case in law) .

Reference-contexts: In the body of this paper, we will define and discuss these principles in detail.

The primitive categories are: normative knowledge, world knowledge, responsibility knowledge, reactive knowledge, creative knowledge, and meta-legal knowledge.

It is complete in that it provides a self contained set of basic (primitive) categories of legal knowledge such that all types of legal knowledge can be defined based on them. <p> In the functional ontology of law, we proposed languages varying from formal to semi-formal for representing most of the categories proposed (see <ref> (Valente, 1995) </ref>). Because a principled core ontology partitions the domain in reasonably self-contained pieces, one does not need to find a single general formalism to reason with them. <p> This may be an important factor if domain-specific reasoning is viewed as the production and evaluation of arguments (as it is indeed the case in law) .

Reference-contexts: In a recent work by one of the authors, an ontology was constructed from the knowledge base of INSPECT, a system for critiquing air campaign plans <ref> (Valente et al., 1996) </ref>. The idea was to make this ontology public within a group of researchers that are building other applications in the air campaign planning domain.

Reference-contexts: An (application) ontology is more than a simple documentation. It has a strong justification and quality assurance flavor, because an ontology supports consistent use of terms. This role is the standard one in the context of knowledge engineering methodologies (see, for example, <ref> (Wielinga et al., 1992) </ref>, (van Heijst et al., 1996)). 4. The most often cited role of ontologies is in enabling reuse of knowledge for building (new) applications. In Sec. 5 we will elaborate on this role. 5. An ontology may be used as the basis for a knowledge representation language.
