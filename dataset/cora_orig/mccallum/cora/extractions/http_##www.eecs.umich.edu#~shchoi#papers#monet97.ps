Abstract: A wireless local area network (WLAN) or a cell with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for various types of traffic is considered. A centralized (i.e., star) network is adopted as the topology of a cell which consists of a base station and a number of mobile clients. Dynamic Time Division Duplexed (TDD) transmission is used, and hence, the same frequency channel is time-shared for downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic control of the base station. We divide traffic into two classes: class I (real-time) and II (non-real-time). Whenever there is no eligible class-I traffic for transmission, class-II traffic which requires no delay-bound guarantees is transmitted, while uplink transmissions are controlled with a reservation scheme. Class-I traffic which requires a bounded delay and guaranteed throughput is handled with the framing strategy [1] which consists of a smoothness traffic model and the stop-and-go queueing scheme. We also establish the admission test for adding new class-I connections. We present a modified framing strategy for class-I voice uplink transmissions which utilizes the wireless link efficiently at the cost of some packet losses. Finally, we present the performance (average delay and throughput) evaluation of the reservation scheme for class-II traffic using both analytical calculations and simulations. fl A subject of materials in this paper was presented at the IEEE INFOCOM'97, Kobe, Japan, April 9-11, 1997.

Reference-contexts: Basically, class-II traffic is transmitted when there is no class-I traffic to be transmitted since it has lower priority than class I. The reservation scheme is also used for mobile clients to request new class-I connections. The framing strategy <ref> [1, 5] </ref>, which was originally proposed as a framework for congestion management in integrated service packet networks, is, with some modifications, used to provide guaranteed delay bound and guaranteed throughput for class I traffic. <p> We first obtain the average number of the queued downlink messages or uplink requests in the base station service queue which is given by E <ref> [ ^ N 1j ^ N &gt; 1] </ref> = n n ; (26) because ^ N (t) 1 corresponds to the number of downlink messages or queued requests in the base station service queue for [E k ; E k+1 ). <p> Now, the queueing delay is given using Little's theorem: D q = E <ref> [ ^ N 1j ^ N &gt; 1] </ref>=G 0 where G 0 new = total = d + R s u for the system to be stable. Now, the downlink delay is given by D d = E [L 1 S. Choi, K. G.

But, dynamic TDD allows for more efficient link utilization in the case of unbalanced uplink and downlink traffic, e.g., non-interactive data transmissions as shown in [16]. We assume all packets, like ATM cells, to be of the same fixed size. <p> we will ignore the packet-propagation delay, because it is usually small relative to the other delay components like queuing and transmission delays in a cell. (A cell in this paper refers to a micro-cell, which has coverage of a few hundred meters, or a pico-cell, which covers small indoor areas <ref> [2] </ref>). Since the wireless channel is inherently unreliable (due to noises, interferences, and multipath fadings), we need a special means to ensure the error-free delivery of packets through each wireless link. Usually, a combined channel coding and diversity scheme [17] is used to meet this need. <p> In the existing wireless communications, other voice coding schemes like ADPCM, QCELP, and VSELP are used to reduce the bit rate to cope with the wireless bandwidth limitation <ref> [2] </ref>. However, in this paper, we adopt a simple PCM scheme to show how the framing strategy can be modified to accommodate voice communication more efficiently. S. Choi, K. G.

Reference-contexts: In this topology, the uplink (mobile-to-base) is not a broadcast channel while the downlink (base-to-mobile) is. Hence, mobile clients are not able to listen directly to other mobiles using the same frequency channel. This assumed situation can occur in real world due to the existence of hidden terminals <ref> [15] </ref>. As shown in Figure 2, the transmission ranges of mobile 1 and 2 do not allow them to hear each other, but can both be heard by the base station in between. Mobile 1 and 2 are hidden terminals to each other.
