Reference-contexts: Similar studies have been performed on humans, but the results are not so conclusive, so I shall not discuss them. Six main review articles have been written on this area: <ref> [Smith85, McGrath78, Fishbein78, Pearlman79, Ellman77, Ellman91] </ref>. <p> The main ones are: 1 Some "dreams" can occur outside of REM sleep, but they are less bizarre and vivid in character, and are usually called "sleep mentation". 2 This procedure is not entirely without problems. <ref> [Ellman77, p355] </ref> cite a study in which the weight of the recording cables affected the sleep patterns of the animal. 1 * Total time spent in stage REM * % of time spent in stage REM * Latency to first REM period * Mean REM duration period * REM density i.e. <p> Howver, not all tasks lead to such an increase. To understand why some tasks produce an increase while others do not, it is helpful to consider Seligman's distinction between "prepared" and "unprepared" tasks ([Seligman70]; see also <ref> [Ellman77, page 404] </ref>). Prepared tasks are ones for which the animal has a "hard-wired" solution, either due to genetics or past experience. Examples include passive and one-way active avoidance tasks and position learning. Such tasks do not usually lead to REM increases, presumably because they are too "simple".

Reference-contexts: I shall therefore give a very brief review of the Hopfield model before presenting the C&M theory. The following presentation is based on <ref> [Hertz91, chapter 2] </ref>, which is highly recommended. <p> To see this intuitively, consider the following example (from [Hopfield83]) Memory 1 Walter, white Memory 2 Walter, black Memory 3 Harold, grey Spurious memory Walter, grey 6 Toulouse has called this assumption "a clever step backwards from biological realism" (quoted in <ref> [Hertz91, p22] </ref>). It is clever because it guarantees the existence of a Lyapunov function (see later), but it is unrealistic because real neurons are not interconnected by identical synapses in each direction. 6 where grey is taken as a category equally resembling black and white.

Reference-contexts: That is, NE facilitates attention. Various people have suggested (see references in <ref> [Hobson88, p 211] </ref>) that the hippocampus plays a role in attention, too. <p> This agrees with Winson's gating theory. 5.7 Attentional theories of learning We have seen that the hippocampus is implicated in both attention and learning. Can we produce some kind of "unified theory"? Attentional theories of learning (see <ref> [Hobson88] </ref>) propose that the rate of learning about a given stimulus is controlled by the attention devoted to that particular stimulus. <p> During SWS, information is free to flow from the cortex to the hippocampus and back to the cortex. Now it is widely believed that the cortex is where memories are stored in the long term. Steriade et al. (see <ref> [Hobson88] </ref>) have found increased firing rates of cortical association neurons during REM sleep. This needs to be investigated further.

([van Hemmen90]) have shown theoretically, that both the problems of fantasy and obsession can be cured by using a procedure called "unlearning" or "reverse learning".

Reference-contexts: Six main review articles have been written on this area: [Smith85, McGrath78, Fishbein78, Pearlman79, Ellman77, Ellman91]. In the following I draw mainly on [Smith85] and [McGrath78], plus the discussion in <ref> [Horne88, chapter 8] </ref>. 2.1 Measuring changes in REM sleep parameters To measure any changes in the animals' sleeping patterns, a polygraphic recording of the EEG, EOG and EMG signals is made by placing electrodes at certain standardised positions. 2 A variety of parameters are used to describe REM sleep. <p> The sleep of dolphins is fascinating, since they sleep with one half of their brains at a time. Each half alternates every two hours or so. No one knows why this is, but Mukhametov (see <ref> [Horne88, p222] </ref>) has suggested it has to do with the fact that dolphins, unlike seals, need to swim to the surrface to breathe. <p> These findings are hard to explain using a learning theory of REM sleep, for surely a 1 year old child is learning more than a fetus! Roffwarg, Muzio and Dement (see <ref> [Horne88, p269] </ref>) have therefore proposed their ontogenetic theory of REM sleep, which claims that CNS activity during REM sleep serves to stimulate the developing brain at a time when external stimuli are not present. <p> Interestingly, Berger (see <ref> [Horne88, p259] </ref>) has found that for those blind since birth, there were no REMs during REM sleep, whereas for those who became blind later, such eye movements were present, but varied according to the length of the blindness. (Blind people mostly have auditory dreams.) 6 A research proposal The experiments of

Reference-contexts: waking state; the electrocculogram (EOG) shows spikes corresponding to Rapid Eye Movements (REMs); the electromyogram (EMG) indicates a loss of muscle tonus (i.e. the body becomes effectively paralysed); and Central Nervous System (CNS) activity increases, as indicated by increased neural firing, blood flow, metabolic rate and temperature. (See for example <ref> [Kelly91] </ref> for an overview of sleep physiology.) REM sleep is sometimes called Paradoxical Sleep (PS), because it is simultaneously the deepest form of sleep (in the sense that thresholds to external stimuli are highest) and yet the form of sleep most like the waking state.

Reference-contexts: Put another way, we do not "reality test" our dreams. 11 5.9 Rapid eye movements, PGO spikes and orienting responses PGO spikes, which arise spontaneously in the pons, are correlated, both temporally and directionally, with rapid eye movements during REM sleep. Bowker (see <ref> [Morrison83] </ref>) found that it was possible to elicit PGO spikes even during waking, by arousing the animal. This makes the PGO spikes very similar to eye movement potentials (EMPs) which occur during waking as a general alerting reponse. <p> The other motor activities normally associated with ORs are inhibited during REM sleep, but by lesioning certain locations in the pons, it is possible to produce a state known as "REM sleep without atonia", in which the animal is free to move about while dreaming (see <ref> [Morrison83] </ref>). These experiments are usually performed in cats, which make motions typical of orienting towards prey, searching for prey and attacking; these movements are rarely directed at anything in the environment.

Reference-contexts: the responsiveness of receptors to sustained periods of LC activity in waking was maintained by sustained silent periods coupled to REM sleep. (p226) 5.5 Norepinephrine and REM sleep Let us briefly examine the evidence pointing to a connection between REM sleep and NE production. (The following quotations are all from <ref> [Siegel88] </ref>.) First there is evidence from REMD studies. Many of the behavioural changes produced by manipulation of the NE system are similar to those induced by REM sleep deprivation. REM sleep deprivation and depletion of NE with reserpine both increase sex drive and aggressive behaviours.

Reference-contexts: For example, the REM duration probably cannot increase beyond a certain length because the animal's temperature would go out of control (see <ref> [Wehr92] </ref> for more on the connection between REM sleep and temperature regulation). <p> This is important because the tail is the main temperature regulator in rats, and there is strong evidence that one of the functions of REM sleep is temperature control (see <ref> [Wehr92] </ref>). The test rats's sleep is also regularly interrupted. Maybe this fact is more important than the deprivation of REM.

Reference-contexts: For instance, 8 predatory behaviour in the cat, prey behaviour in the rabbit, and exploratory behaviour in the rat, all give rise the theta rhythm. It is also known that hippocampal theta occurs during REM sleep. To test the idea that this was related to learning, Winson (see <ref> [Winson90] </ref>) decided to lesion the septum (the source of the theta waves) in a rat which had previously learnt its way around a maze. <p> As mentioned, the place cells exhibited increased firing during both SWS and REM sleep. In fact, the increase during SWS was the larger. This is in accord with Winson and Abzug's demonstration of behavioural gating (see <ref> [Winson90] </ref>).
