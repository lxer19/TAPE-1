Abstract: Computer science has an experimental scientific aspect|like every other science. Experiments are made with suitable computer programs in order to discover facts. The programs are usually not applications but specialized to the scientific problem being investigated. It is a mistake to divide computer science simply into theoretical and applied parts. Basic computer science has both theoretical and applied parts. Applied computer science certainly has an experimental part, and presumably it has a theoretical part also. We wouldn't expect to have to tell you this.
