The concept of emergence involves the idea that at any given level of complexity, some properties characteristic of that level (emergent at that level) are irreducible. Such properties do not exist at lower levels in the sense that they are meaningless in the language appropriate to those levels.

Reference-contexts: The performance measures were chosen to be delay and fuel burn because of the importance of these factors in the justification of CTAS: "If CTAS were to be implemented nationwide, the airlines would save about a billion dollars per year, mostly from reductions in delay and fuel costs." <ref> [Mew97] </ref>. The ETA's were calculated for each aircraft by simply obtaining the product of speed and distance for each arc and summing over all arcs on the aircraft's path.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, in cases A and C all aircraft followed the path with minimum fuel burn, whereas in cases B and D the safest path was taken. Finally, algorithm E introduced the possibility to pass horizontally. This algorithm was based on a proposed scheduling algorithm described in <ref> [New66] </ref>. Algorithm E recognizes two horizons|initial and freeze. The initial horizon was located at the entrance of Center while the freeze horizon was located 165 nm away from the feeder gate. As aircraft enter the Center and pass the initial horizon, their ETA is calculated and an STA is generated. <p> a problem if humans are presented with meaningful information in a coherent, structured context. "People don't mind dealing with complexity if they have some way of controlling or handling it . . . if a person is allowed to structure a complex situation according to his perceptual and conceptual needs <ref> [New66] </ref>. One approach found to be effective in dealing with complexity is hierarchical abstraction, that is, structuring the situation such that the problem solver can transfer the problem to a different level of abstraction.

Reference-contexts: Although fuel flow is a function of several variables, there exists precedent for adopting the assumption that fuel flow remains constant for the time period of interest at the given altitude (see <ref> [Tho96] </ref>). Deviations from this optimum altitude are modeled as a fuel flow penalty. Table 3 lists the fuel flow penalties used in this study. The equation to determine the amount of fuel burned in a given arc [Tho96] is: F uel = Average F uel Consumption fl (1 + Altitude P <p> remains constant for the time period of interest at the given altitude (see <ref> [Tho96] </ref>).

The transit time was calculated as the distance between waypoints (fixed at 16.5 nm) divided by the speed of the aircraft at the particular flying altitude. <p> Three different types of aircraft were used for the study, where the aircraft were assumed to maintain their listed cruise Mach number during their entire flight (i.e., they do not change speed in level flight, and do not change cruise Mach with altitude) <ref> [Tho96] </ref>. Due to the lack of real data, the aircraft mix and characteristics were taken from a study of Oceanic Airspace Design [Tho96]. Two cases of speeds modified by altitude were studied.

Reference-contexts: Five altitude levels were used 116 117 with a vertical separation of 1000 ft. The feeder gate is located at the lowest altitude, FL 330 <ref> [TAEO85] </ref>. Therefore, all aircraft finish their route at 33000 ft of altitude regardless of the starting altitude. More altitude levels are necessary to more accurately describe the physical system, however this preliminary model was developed with only five levels to demonstrate the potential of this methodology.
