Abstract: We present algorithms for kinematic manipulation of molecular chains subject to fixed bond lengths and bond angles. They are useful for calculating conformations of a molecule subject to geometric constraints, such as those derived from two-dimensional NMR experiments. Other applications include searching out the full range of conformations available to a molecule such as cyclic configurations. We make use of results from robot kinematics and recently developed algorithms for solving polynomial systems. In particular, we model the molecule as a serial chain using the Denavit-Hartenberg formulation and reduce these problems to inverse kinematics of a serial chain. We also highlight the relationship between molecular embedding problems and inverse kinematics. As compared to earlier methods, the main advantages of the kinematic formulation are its generality to all molecular chains without any restrictions on the geometry and efficiency in terms of performance. The algorithms give us real time performance (order of tens of milliseconds) on smaller chains and are applicable to all chains.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the minimal energy conformations found using rigid geometry formulation are a good guess to the actual minima and can be used along with a perturbation treatment for the energy minimization (Go & Scherga 1970). Many interactive systems for molecular modeling such as Sybyl (Tripos 1988) and Insight <ref> (Biosym 1991) </ref> provide capabilities for building and changing molecular models by rotating the torsional angles. The full conformation space of acyclic molecules is the Cartesian product of all the torsional angle with one-dimensional cycles, known as the n-dimensional toroidal manifold, where n is the number of rotatable bonds.

Reference-contexts: In these cases it is assumed that the molecule is under no great strain, so that all bond lengths and bond angles are known from standard values taken from X-ray crystallographic studies on small molecules <ref> (Crippen 1989) </ref>. These constraints are referred to as holonomic constraints. The goal of the embedding algorithms is to find all conformations which satisfy these constraints. In this section, we show the equivalence between the embedding problems and inverse kinematics. <p> Given the experimental and holonomic constraints, the algorithm finds upper and lower bounds for all distances (which satisfy the constraints) and using some random values in this range it computes the closest corresponding three-dimensional metric matrix. Crippen has extended the algorithm using linearized embedding and taking chi-rality into account <ref> (Crippen 1989) </ref>. The overall process is iterative and may take considerable running time on some cases. Furthermore, even for small chains it is not guaranteed to compute all the configurations. We show the equivalence between molecular embedding and inverse kinematics for small chains.

Reference-contexts: In order to deal with the complex geometry of the molecules, we affix frames to the various part of a chain and then describe the re lationship between these chains. In particular, we use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) formalism, <ref> (Denavit & Hartenberg 1955) </ref>, to model a molecule with n rotatable bonds. These rotatable bonds need not correspond to a backbone chain. Each bond is represented by the line along its bond axis and the common normal to the last bond axis.

Reference-contexts: The rigid geometry assumption greatly simplifies the geometric complexity. Moreover, the minimal energy conformations found using rigid geometry formulation are a good guess to the actual minima and can be used along with a perturbation treatment for the energy minimization <ref> (Go & Scherga 1970) </ref>. Many interactive systems for molecular modeling such as Sybyl (Tripos 1988) and Insight (Biosym 1991) provide capabilities for building and changing molecular models by rotating the torsional angles. <p> For cyclic molecules having rotatable bonds in the rings, six degrees of freedom are lost due to the closure constraint. Go and Scheraga have proposed solutions to computing the ring conformations (Go & Scherga 1970; 1973). The algorithm in <ref> (Go & Scherga 1970) </ref> is restricted to molecular chains where the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds and the methods in (Go & Scherga 1973) are for symmetric chains only. They reduce the problem to computing roots of a univariate polynomial.

Reference-contexts: There is a considerable amount of literature on exhaustive methods. A recent survey of different methods is given in <ref> (Howard & Kollman 1988) </ref>. The complexity of the search methods is an exponential function of the number of rotatable joints and therefore limited to chains with low n. For cyclic molecules having rotatable bonds in the rings, six degrees of freedom are lost due to the closure constraint.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, even for small chains it is not guaranteed to compute all the configurations. We show the equivalence between molecular embedding and inverse kinematics for small chains. It can be combined with model building techniques for application to larger chains as shown in <ref> (Leach & Smellie 1992) </ref>. Application to Small Chains In this section we will consider embeddings of molecular chains consisting of up to six rotatable bonds.

Reference-contexts: Recently fast algorithms for solving polynomial systems (Manocha 1992) have been applied to the inverse kinematics of serial chains with six or fewer rotatable joints. They are based on the algebraic formulation of the problem and make no assumptions on its geometry <ref> (Manocha, Zhu, & Wright 1994) </ref>. As a result, they are applicable to all molecular chains. The algorithms make use of the algebraic reduction of the problem to a univariate system presented by Raghavan and Roth (Raghavan & Roth 1989). <p> The algorithm involves symbolic preprocessing, numerical substitution and matrix computation. The symbolic preprocessing is performed using MAPLE computer algebra system, and the algorithm has been implemented in C making use of Fortran implementations of matrix computations from LAPACK <ref> (Manocha, Zhu, & Wright 1994) </ref>. The Denavit Hartenberg parameters and end poses of a molecular chain can be computed from the atom coordinates if at least one set of these atom coordinates is available. They can also be computed from standard geometry. <p> Extension to All Molecular Chains An algorithm for kinematic manipulation of molecular chains with six or fewer dihedral angles is presened in <ref> (Manocha, Zhu, & Wright 1994) </ref>. In this section, we highlight techniques for manipulation of molecular chains with more than six rotatable angles. Given a molecular chain with n torsional angles, the problem of kinematic manipulation reduces to 6 equations in n unknowns.

Reference-contexts: However, they suffer from two drawbacks. Firstly they are slow for practical applica-tions and secondly they are unable to compute all the solutions. As a result, most industrial manipulators are designed sufficiently simply so that a closed form exists. Recently fast algorithms for solving polynomial systems <ref> (Manocha 1992) </ref> have been applied to the inverse kinematics of serial chains with six or fewer rotatable joints. They are based on the algebraic formulation of the problem and make no assumptions on its geometry (Manocha, Zhu, & Wright 1994). As a result, they are applicable to all molecular chains. <p> In general, the algorithm can compute the solutions to a good accuracy. However, near higher multiplicity roots (say double roots), the problem can be ill-conditioned and special processing is needed to compute these high multiplicity solutions, as highlighted in <ref> (Manocha 1992) </ref>. q1 q3 q4 q6 d Y search on 7 and 8 The performance of the inverse kinematics algorithm for conformation search of a cyclooctane has been highlighted in Table 2. In particular, the running time is shown for different grid size increments.

Reference-contexts: This includes the distance constraints from two-dimensional NMR experiments and homology based modeling. The resulting algorithms are also useful for structure prediction, protein folding, model building, 3D molecular matching and drug design <ref> (G.R. Marshall et. al. 1979) </ref>. The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. We introduce the inverse kinematics formulation in Section 2 and reduce the problems of molecular conformation to solving system of polynomial equations. In Section 3, we apply the kinematic formulation to compute molecular embeddings.

Reference-contexts: As a result, they are applicable to all molecular chains. The algorithms make use of the algebraic reduction of the problem to a univariate system presented by Raghavan and Roth <ref> (Raghavan & Roth 1989) </ref>. However the symbolic derivation highlighted by Raghavan and Roth does not take care of all the geometries (e.g. the polypeptide configurations). As opposed to reducing the problem to finding roots of a univariate polynomial, we formulate it as an eigenvalue problem.

Reference-contexts: The main advantages of the matrix formulation are in efficiency and accuracy. The reduction to a univariate polynomial involves expanding a symbolic determinant, which is relatively expensive. Moreover the problem of finding roots of polynomial of degree 16 can be numerically ill-conditioned <ref> (Wilkinson 1959) </ref>. As a result, we may not be able to compute accurate results using IEEE double precision arithmetic on current workstations. Performance The algorithm for solving inverse kinematics works very well in practice and on the applications highlighted above.
