Title: An Efficient Multilayer MCM Router Based on Four-Via Routing

Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient multilayer general area router, named V4R, for MCM and dense PCB designs. One unique feature of the V4R router is that it uses no more than four interconnection vias to route every net and yet produces high quality routing solutions. Another unique feature of the V4R router is it combines global routing and detailed routing in one step and produces high quality detailed routing solutions directly from the given netlist and module placement. Several combinatorial optimization techniques, including efficient algorithms for computing a maximum weighted k -cofamily in a partially ordered set and a maximum weighted non-crossing matching in a bipartite graph, are used to solve the combined problem efficiently. As a result, the V4R router is independent of net ordering, runs much faster, and uses far less memory compared to other multilayer general area routers. We tested our router on several examples, including three industrial MCM designs from MCC. Compared with the 3D maze router, on average the V4R router uses 44% fewer vias, 2% less wirelength, and runs 26 times faster. Compared with the SLICE router, on average the V4R router uses 9% fewer vias, 4% less wirelength, and runs 3.5 times faster. The V4R also uses fewer routing layers compared to the 3D maze router and the SLICE router.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction As VLSI fabrication technology advances, interconnection and packaging technology has become a bottleneck in system performance <ref> [36, 2, 20] </ref>. The multichip module (MCM) technology has been developed recently to increase the packing density and eliminate a level of interconnection by assembling and connecting bare chips on a common substrate. The substrate consists of multiple routing layers used for chip-to-chip interconnections. <p> For high-performance MCMs, vias not only increase the manufacture cost but also degrade the system performance since they form impedance discontinuities and cause reflections when the interconnections have to be modeled as transmission lines <ref> [2] </ref>. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 2 The majority of the nets in MCM designs are two-terminal nets. For example, in the MCM example of 37 VHSIC gate-arrays that we obtained from MCC, 94% of the nets are two terminals nets. <p> The I/O terminals (pads) of the modules are connected to the substrate either directly or through routing to the external pads that surround the individual modules for engineering changes <ref> [2] </ref>. The pads are brought to the first signal routing layer either directly through distribution vias or through one or more redistribution layers. The redistribution layers are required when the pad spacing does not match the line spacing on the signal routing layers.

Reference-contexts: First, MCMs may have far more interconnection layers than ICs. For example, the multi-chip module developed for the IBM 3081 mainframe has 33 layers of molybdenum conductors (including 1 bonding layer, 5 distribution layers, 16 interconnection layers, 8 voltage reference layers, and 3 power distribution layers <ref> [4, 3] </ref>). Fujitsu's latest supercomputer, the VP-2000, uses a ceramic substrate with over 50 -2- interconnection layers [19]. Moreover, unlike routing in ICs where the routing region can be naturally decomposed into channels and switchboxes, there is no natural routing hierarchy in MCM routing.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a multilayer MCM router named SLICE was developed by Khoo and Cong <ref> [29] </ref>. It computes a routing solution on a layer-by-layer basis and carries out planar routing in each layer. On average it uses 29% fewer vias and runs four times faster than the 3D maze router. <p> We applied the algorithm by Khoo and Cong presented in <ref> [29] </ref> which reduces the problem of computing a generalized maximum weighted non-crossing matching to the problem of computing a maximum weighted chain in the x -y plane. <p> Furthermore, no more than 6 interconnection vias are used for the nets that are routed using multi-via routing. Table 4 shows the comparison of the V4R router with a general 3D maze router and the SLICE router for multilayer MCM designs <ref> [29] </ref>. The 3D maze router was implemented to penalize bends and vias usage in the routing solution. Heuristics used in line-search algorithms were also incorporated to improve its running time and the quality of the routing solution.

Reference-contexts: As a result, router X uses fewer vias. We expect that the via usage of V4R can be reduced considerably by a post-processing step using either an optimal 2-layer constrained via minimization algorithm (such as the one by Kuo, Chern, and Shih <ref> [30] </ref>) or efficient heuristic algorithms (such as the one proposed by The, Wong, and Cong [43]) for each layer pair. These post-processing operations allow both horizontal and vertical routing on each layer for via reduction (see also discussion in Section 3.6.1).

Reference-contexts: Thus, traditional PCB routing tools are often inadequate in dealing with MCM designs 1 . Few methods are available for multilayer MCM routing. A commonly used method for multilayer MCM designs is the three-dimensional (3D) maze routing <ref> [19, 33] </ref>. Although this method is conceptually simple to implement, it suffers from several problems. First, the quality of the maze routing solution is very sensitive to the ordering of the nets being routed, yet there is no effective algorithm for determining a good net ordering in general.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction As VLSI fabrication technology advances, interconnection and packaging technology has become a bottleneck in system performance <ref> [36, 2, 20] </ref>. The multichip module (MCM) technology has been developed recently to increase the packing density and eliminate a level of interconnection by assembling and connecting bare chips on a common substrate. The substrate consists of multiple routing layers used for chip-to-chip interconnections. <p> The use of maze router again slows down the computation and introduces extra vias. Several efficient routers have been proposed for silicon-on-silicon based MCM technology <ref> [36, 12, 11, 13] </ref>. Since the number of routing layers is usually small (2 layers for signal routing in most cases) in this technology, many techniques for IC routing, such as hierarchical routing and rubber-band routing, can be applied to yield good solutions.

Reference-contexts: The best reported complexity is O (n logn ) [1]. The results in [9] and <ref> [38] </ref> leads to polynomial time algorithms for computing the maximum weighted non-crossing matching in k -layers. However, these algorithms do not apply to the generalized maximum weighted non-crossing matching problem we are interested in, which allows the edges of the same net to share a vertex in the matching solution. <p> For example, the dark edges in Fig. 7 (b) shows a 2-cofamily in P (U ) and Fig. 7 (c) shows the corresponding interval set of density 2. The maximum weighted k -cofamily problem has been studied by Cong and Liu [9] and by Sarrafzadeh and Lou <ref> [38] </ref>. The algorithm by Cong and Liu [9] computes a maximum weighted k -cofamily in a poset in O ((n -k )n 2 ) time, and the algorithm by Sarrafzadeh and Lou [38] computes a maximum weighted k -cofamily in a poset in O (kn 2 ) time, where n is <p> maximum weighted k -cofamily problem has been studied by Cong and Liu [9] and by Sarrafzadeh and Lou <ref> [38] </ref>.

Both algorithms are based on computing a minimum cost maximum flow in a network.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the maximum weighted matching problem in a bipartite graph can be reduced to the minimum cost maximum flow problem in a network which has a cubic time optimal solution (the reader may refer to <ref> [16, 42] </ref> for the details of the reduction). <p> Proof The optimal track assignment for the right terminals is reduced to finding the minimum cost maximum flow in the simplified bipartite graph RG c . Using the algorithm in <ref> [42, pp. 110] </ref>, this can be solved in O ( | M | . m log (2+m /n ) n ) time where n and m are the number nodes and edges in RG c respectively and | M | is the size of the maximum matching.

Reference-contexts: We expect that the via usage of V4R can be reduced considerably by a post-processing step using either an optimal 2-layer constrained via minimization algorithm (such as the one by Kuo, Chern, and Shih [30]) or efficient heuristic algorithms (such as the one proposed by The, Wong, and Cong <ref> [43] </ref>) for each layer pair. These post-processing operations allow both horizontal and vertical routing on each layer for via reduction (see also discussion in Section 3.6.1). One may notice that for example mcc1, router X uses 15% fewer vias than V4R.

Reference-contexts: For these special nets, it may be necessary to route them in a different layer using a different routing algorithm with better control on routing topologies, such as those used in <ref> [27, 28, 44, 46] </ref>. 4.

Reference-contexts: We can also assign higher weights to the timing critical nets so that they have a higher chance of being hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 6 The use of the conventional notion of vertical constraint <ref> [14, 45] </ref> is a little confusing here since CH c is a vertical channel.
