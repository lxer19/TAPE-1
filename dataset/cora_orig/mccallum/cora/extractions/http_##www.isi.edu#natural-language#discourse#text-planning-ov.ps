Abstract: This paper summarizes work over the past five years on the automated planning and generation of multisentence texts using discourse structure relations, placing it in context of ongoing efforts by Computational Linguists and Linguists to understand the structure of discourse. Based on a series of studies by the author and others, the paper describes how the orientation of generation toward communicative intentions illuminates the central structural role played by intersegment discourse relations. It outlines several facets of discourse structure relations as they are required by and used in text planners | their nature, number, and extension to associated tasks such as sentence planning and text formatting.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Every day, people produce thousands of words of connected discourse from complicated internal knowledge for little-understood reasons. Today, after three decades of work on natural language processing, computers are beginning to approach this capability. Computational studies such as <ref> [Appelt 85] </ref> have established the power of viewing language generation as a goal-driven and hence essentially planning process (in contrast to analysis, which is input-driven and essentially inferential).

Reference-contexts: What's more, the systematicity holds across various types of texts, genres, and registers of formality. It is found in books, articles, advertisements, papers, letters, and even memos. The information these devices convey supplements the primary content of the text. Though manuals of style (such as <ref> [CMS 82, APA 83, Van Leunen 79] </ref>) may seem relevant, they contain little more than precise descriptions of the preferred forms of textual devices in fact. We therefore classified textual devices into three broad classes | Depiction, Position, and Composition | and tried to provide functional descriptions of them.

Reference-contexts: 7 3 A First Attempt: Text Structuring Using RST The first experiment in dynamic text structure planning involved developing a paragraph structure planner and applying it to several domains, including an expert system [Hovy 88], a code development system [Hovy & Arens 91], and a multimodal database information display system <ref> [Hovy 90a, Arens et al. 88] </ref>. This paper contains examples from the latter, the Integrated Interfaces system, a multimodal presentation program that uses maps, tables, and paragraphs of text to answer users' requests for the display of information from a data base of naval information about ships' deployments.

Reference-contexts: a text production system be made to plan not only the content and structure of the text but also the appropriate textual formatting for it? The answer is yes, and this section describes an experiment that demonstrates this ability. 6.3.1 Textual Devices In the course of work on multimedia communication <ref> [Hovy & Arens 90, Arens & Hovy 90] </ref>, we noticed an interesting fact: not only are the text layouts and styles (plain text, itemized lists, enumerations, italicized text, inserts, which are called here textual devices) used systematically to convey information, but it is possible to define their communicative semantics precisely enough

Reference-contexts: The manual contains headings, term definitions signaled by italicized terms, enumerated lists, and so forth. After studies of instructional texts (including recipes, school textbooks, and manuals for cars, sewing machines, and video players) conducted at USC/ISI and the University of Nijmegen <ref> [Vossers 91, Arens et al. 92] </ref>, we concluded that certain textual formatting devices are highly correlated with specific configurations of the underlying text structure tree. For example, a series of nested Sequences, such as appears in Figure 10, is usually realized in the text as an enumerated list.

Reference-contexts: The theories are strong on the particular intersegment relations and their use as operators in planning algorithms; they tend to be weakest on the precise form of the discourse structure. This approach has a fairly long history as well; researchers going back to Aristotle <ref> [Aristotle 54] </ref> have recognized that in coherent text successive pieces of text are related in a relatively small set of particular ways. Hobbs [Hobbs 78, Hobbs 79] produced a set of relations organized into four categories, which he postulated as the four types of phenomena that occur during communication.

Reference-contexts: The structure planner built the paragraph tree shown in Figure 10. Though the form of the text closely mirrors that of the actual Air Traffic Control Manual <ref> [ASA 89] </ref>, the differences in formatting are significant; and these differences make the manual much more readable. The manual contains headings, term definitions signaled by italicized terms, enumerated lists, and so forth.

Reference-contexts: To accommodate both types, the definition of discourse segments in Section 4 associates both intentions and structural relations with each discourse segment. Differentiating the two types of object into intentional plans and structural relations may correspond with the distinction made in <ref> [Austin 65] </ref> between sentences with perlocutionary effect, such as persuading or motivating, and those with illocutionary effect, such as elaborating, identifying, or describing, though, as Maybury's attempt to do so shows, this distinction is unfortunately hampered by the vagueness of the notions of perlocution and illocution and imprecision in plans' and

Reference-contexts: Early multisentence analyzers either used predefined large-scale knowledge structures that spanned the relevant content of the text, such as scripts (SAM [Cullingford 78], FRUMP [DeJong 79], BORIS [Dyer 83]), or else dynamically built up structures using rules particular to the purpose, such as the argument structure work of <ref> [Birnbaum et al. 80] </ref> and [Sycara 87]. One of the first text generators that took discourse structure into account explicitly was TEXT [McKeown 85].

Reference-contexts: Within noun phrases, the problem of delimiting and organizing content involves three major issues. The first issue relates to pronominalization. It is widely accepted that pronominaliza-tion is sensitive to segmental boundaries, at least on the relatively major level; see for example <ref> [Bjorklund & Virtanen 89] </ref>, or the analyses of conversations by Passoneau, which suggest that discourse referents are available for pronominalization in the local context only [Passoneau 91].

The effectiveness of these additions to the basic plan format is discussed at length in [Moore 89, Maybury 90]. Based on the above work, as well as on the EDGE planner <ref> [Cawsey 90] </ref>, the planners of [Kreyss & Novak 90] and [Rosner & Stede 92], and the more structurally oriented text representation in SPOKESMAN [Meteer 90], one can define a text plan P as a tuple (name, effects, constraints, preconditions, decomposition), where: * The name is a unique identifier of the segment.

In the structurer's operationalized relations, then, each relation/plan has two primary parts, a Nucleus and a Satellite, and recursively relates some unit (s) of the input, or another relation (cast as Nucleus), to other unit (s) of the input or another relation (cast as Satellite).

Reference-contexts: In addition, since the Nucleus and Satellite material is usually expanded upon in typical domain-specific ways (see the discussion in <ref> [Conklin & McDonald 82] </ref>), possible paths of expansion are contained in growth points: collections of goals that suggest the inclusion of additional material in appropriate places in the text.

Reference-contexts: of discourse structure from several intellectual sub-fields, various researchers have produced somewhat more extensive lists of intersegment relations | from philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g., [Quirk & Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85, Martin 92]) to computational linguists (e.g., [Hobbs 79, Mann & Thompson 88]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers (e.g., <ref> [Schank & Abelson 77, Dahlgren 88] </ref>). Typically, their lists contain between five and fifty relations, and they argue that (at least) tens of interclausal relations are required to describe the structure of English discourse; one can call this the Profligate Position.

Reference-contexts: Other categorizations of typical intersentential relations were developed by [Grimes 75, Shepherd 26, Dahlgren 88, Mann & Thompson 88, Martin 92], to name a few. A combination of the formalist and functionalist ideas is embodied in the theory of discourse developed by <ref> [Grosz & Sidner 86] </ref>. <p> [Dale 88], the EES text planner [Moore & Swartout 90, Moore 89, Paris 90], TEXPLAN [Maybury 90], EDGE [Cawsey 90], SPOKESMAN [Meteer 90], PIT [Kreyss & Novak 90], POPEL [Reithinger 91], JOYCE [Rambow & Korelsky 92] and others) and taking as far as possible into account the theoretical work of <ref> [Grosz & Sidner 86, Asher 92, 11 Polanyi 88] </ref> and the work on intention recognition [Allen & Perrault 80, Litman 85, Pollack 86, Lambert & Carberry 91], the following general assertions about the structure of plan-based English discourse can be formulated: 1. <p> At the top level, the discourse is governed by a single root node; at the leaves, the basic segments are single grammatical clauses. 2. Purpose: Each discourse segment has an associated purpose, which (following <ref> [Grosz & Sidner 86] </ref>) we call the Discourse Segment Purpose (DSP) and represent at each node of the tree. Each DSP is a communicative goal of the speaker. In a successful discourse, the contents of each segment achieve its DSP. <p> Typically, their lists contain between five and fifty relations, and they argue that (at least) tens of interclausal relations are required to describe the structure of English discourse; one can call this the Profligate Position. On the other hand, some researchers, (e.g., <ref> [Grosz & Sidner 86, Polanyi 88, Kamp 81] </ref>) prefer not to identify a specific set of such relations.

Reference-contexts: Approaching the problem of discourse structure from several intellectual sub-fields, various researchers have produced somewhat more extensive lists of intersegment relations | from philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g., <ref> [Quirk & Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85, Martin 92] </ref>) to computational linguists (e.g., [Hobbs 79, Mann & Thompson 88]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers (e.g., [Schank & Abelson 77, Dahlgren 88]). <p> Increasing differentiation of relations, continued until the very finest nuances of meaning are separately represented, need be pursued only to the extent required for any given application. The top-level differentiation of relations into three basic kinds (see Figure 12) is motivated on linguistic and semantic grounds. As discussed in <ref> [Halliday 85] </ref>, two clauses can be related in at most three different ways simultaneously | semantically, interpersonally, and presentationally (what Halliday calls the metafunctions of language: ideational, interpersonal, and textual): 1. Well (presentational), frankly (interpersonal), earlier (semantic) I had a wonderful time. . . . 2.

Reference-contexts: four major issues, including further studies that were carried out, and outlines remaining work to be done. 7 3 A First Attempt: Text Structuring Using RST The first experiment in dynamic text structure planning involved developing a paragraph structure planner and applying it to several domains, including an expert system <ref> [Hovy 88] </ref>, a code development system [Hovy & Arens 91], and a multimodal database information display system [Hovy 90a, Arens et al. 88]. <p> The equivalent of preservation goals, such as the (not hierarchically decomposable) goals to imbue the text with specific stylistic qualities in order to achieve pragmatic effects such as clarity and formality, are not yet handled by text planners (although see the work of <ref> [Green 92, Hovy 88] </ref>). 5.1.2 Text Plans vs. Intersegment Relations The dual nature of the planner's output | simultaneously a communication plan and a linguistic structure | has led to much confusion and remains unresolved.

Reference-contexts: 7 3 A First Attempt: Text Structuring Using RST The first experiment in dynamic text structure planning involved developing a paragraph structure planner and applying it to several domains, including an expert system [Hovy 88], a code development system [Hovy & Arens 91], and a multimodal database information display system <ref> [Hovy 90a, Arens et al. 88] </ref>. This paper contains examples from the latter, the Integrated Interfaces system, a multimodal presentation program that uses maps, tables, and paragraphs of text to answer users' requests for the display of information from a data base of naval information about ships' deployments. <p> Since both schemas and text plans specify the nature and order of the material to be communicated, it is possible to view text plans operationally as mini-schemas. One way of unifying the representation of text plans and schemas was outlined in <ref> [Hovy 90a] </ref>. By treating any text structuring operator | schema or text plan | as an ordered list of mandatory communicative subgoals, the effect is that of a schema. The planner simply constructs a portion of the discourse for each subgoal without reasoning about the interrelatedness of portions. <p> The planner must perform additional reasoning to determine why the material satisfying various subgoals should be included and how it relates overall to ensure textual coherence. Thus, as shown in <ref> [Hovy 90a] </ref>, by treating the growth point goals in RST relation/plans as injunctions that specify the type and order of additional material to include, rather than as suggestions to do so, a text plan acts as a schema. <p> suggestions for additional growth, two problems are immediately introduced: Which growth point goals should be considered? And in what order should new growths be added to the discourse? It is easy to think of criteria for controlling the inclusion, but difficult to formalize them adequately; 21 for some candidates see <ref> [Hovy 90a] </ref>. One criterion, however, has been studied to some degree. This is the effect of focus shift on discourse structure. 5.4 Focus Shift In any plan of action, the sequence of steps may be fixed or not, depending on the underlying interrelationships among their contents.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, in 1989 the author started collecting intersegment relations that are expressive enough to satisfy the requirements of text planning systems while avoiding an unbounded ad hoc collection of semantic relations. Over 350 such relations from approximately 30 researchers in various fields were collected and taxonomized; see <ref> [Hovy 90b] </ref>. Subsequently, in joint work, over 50 additional relations in other sources were found and an improved taxonomization, consisting of about 70 relations, was produced. <p> Over 500 relations from approximately 35 researchers in various fields were collected and taxonomized in three parallel hierarchies totaling approximately 120 relations; see <ref> [Hovy 90b, Hovy et al. 92] </ref>. The core set of relations is shown in Figure 12. Details about its sources, definitions, and taxonomization procedure can be found in [Hovy & Maier 92].

Reference-contexts: The structurer planned coherent paragraphs in several domains to achieve communicative goals for affecting the hearer's knowledge in some way. It operated after some application program such as a data base or expert system and before the sentence generator Penman <ref> [Hovy 90c, Penman 89, Mann & Matthiessen 83] </ref>). From the application program, the structure planner accepted one or more communicative goals along with a set of clause-sized input entities that represented the material to be generated.

Reference-contexts: a text production system be made to plan not only the content and structure of the text but also the appropriate textual formatting for it? The answer is yes, and this section describes an experiment that demonstrates this ability. 6.3.1 Textual Devices In the course of work on multimedia communication <ref> [Hovy & Arens 90, Arens & Hovy 90] </ref>, we noticed an interesting fact: not only are the text layouts and styles (plain text, itemized lists, enumerations, italicized text, inserts, which are called here textual devices) used systematically to convey information, but it is possible to define their communicative semantics precisely enough

The following are some general uses of these devices (more detail appears in <ref> [Hovy & Arens 91] </ref>): * 1. Depiction: selection of an appropriate letter string format. Parentheses: text is tangential to the main text. Font switching: text has special importance (new term, of central importance, foreign expression) when the surrounding text is not italicized. Capitalization: text string names (identifies) an entity.

Reference-contexts: As it turns out, the theories being developed in these two perspectives are largely complementary, and in fact they seem to be converging, hopefully toward a unified model of general (single- and multi-person) discourse. Following typical formalist analyses, such as <ref> [Kamp 81] </ref>, the argument goes as follows: discourse exhibits internal structure, where structural segments encapsulate semantic units that are closely related. Typically, the theories are used to explain pronominalization and quantifier scoping effects. <p> Most of these theories postulate several levels of plans, each level handling a distinct phenomenon (discourse management, domain knowledge, etc.). 4 Theory (DRT) <ref> [Kamp 81] </ref>, and that of [Polanyi 88, Reichman 85, Cohen 83, Heim 83]. Extending beyond dialogue-length discourse, [Van Dijk 72] discusses large-scale text organization and defines the notion of macro-structures and [Rumelhart 72] develops the idea of story grammars. <p> Typically, their lists contain between five and fifty relations, and they argue that (at least) tens of interclausal relations are required to describe the structure of English discourse; one can call this the Profligate Position. On the other hand, some researchers, (e.g., <ref> [Grosz & Sidner 86, Polanyi 88, Kamp 81] </ref>) prefer not to identify a specific set of such relations.

Reference-contexts: Surveying the text planning systems of several researchers for a variety of domains (aside from the author's text structurer, EPICURE [Dale 88], the EES text planner [Moore & Swartout 90, Moore 89, Paris 90], TEXPLAN [Maybury 90], EDGE [Cawsey 90], SPOKESMAN [Meteer 90], PIT <ref> [Kreyss & Novak 90] </ref>, POPEL [Reithinger 91], JOYCE [Rambow & Korelsky 92] and others) and taking as far as possible into account the theoretical work of [Grosz & Sidner 86, Asher 92, 11 Polanyi 88] and the work on intention recognition [Allen & Perrault 80, Litman 85, Pollack 86, Lambert & <p> Maybury further elaborated text plans, adding preconditions of two kinds, essential and desirable.

Reference-contexts: The functionalist argument goes as follows: discourse exhibits internal structure, where the segments are defined by communicative purpose. The theories tend to concentrate on the goals of the speaker and on the ways these goals are reflected in the discourse structure, often as interrelationships between segments (see <ref> [Levy 79] </ref>). Often, such interrelationships are viewed as reflecting plans of one sort or another which serve the interlocutors' communicative goals. <p> A similar line of argument can be found in <ref> [Levy 79] </ref>. Later work [Moore & Swartout 90, Moore & Paris 91] argued that using discourse structure relations as goals erroneously conflates "rhetorical" (i.e., structural) information with intentionality.

Reference-contexts: to deal with red tape." Sequence-Time: "After he went to live in Moscow, he knew how to deal with red tape." In general, some text genres tend to be more intentional, such as explanatory discourse, while others tend to be more structural, such as encyclopedia entries (for a discussion, see <ref> [Maier & Hovy 91] </ref>). In the former, almost every clause is governed by a separate intention, while in the latter, large portions of the text serve a single discourse intention (often, Describe) and are organized under a considerable tree of discourse structure relations. <p> All the semantic relations are expressed by the single illocutionary act describe, while the interpersonal relations are expressed by various perlocutionary acts, including convince, motivate, and justify. The consequences of this difference on the design of text planning systems are outlined in <ref> [Maier & Hovy 91] </ref>. 38

Reference-contexts: There is simply too much variability in text plans or discourse structure relations; as plan and relation libraries grow, the number of possible texts grows alarmingly (as one would expect, given the plasticity of language). So, as argued in for example <ref> [McKeown 85, Mann 87, Rambow 90, Mooney et al. 90] </ref>, one should capture the idiosyncratic regularities of discourse structure, which may depend on genre, domain, or even simply custom, in schemas and use them as frozen plans by simple schema instantiation.

Reference-contexts: But people do assemble sentences into well-structured multisentence texts in a principled way. What principles do they use? How do the principles relate to inferences? What basic elements govern discourse structure? The key insight for solving these questions is the notion of text coherence. Following <ref> [Mann & Thompson 88] </ref>, we define coherence as follows: 3 A discourse is coherent if the hearer knows the communicative role of each portion of it; that is, if the hearer knows how the speaker intends each clause to relate to each other clause. <p> For text generation, an influential theory of text structure is Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) <ref> [Mann & Thompson 88, Mann & Thompson 86] </ref>, which, based on a study involving some hundreds of paragraphs (ranging over advertisements, scientific articles, letters, newspaper texts, and others), postulates that a set of approximately 25 relations suffices to represent the relations that hold within normal English texts. <p> Approaching the problem of discourse structure from several intellectual sub-fields, various researchers have produced somewhat more extensive lists of intersegment relations | from philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g., [Quirk & Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85, Martin 92]) to computational linguists (e.g., <ref> [Hobbs 79, Mann & Thompson 88] </ref>) to Artificial Intelligence researchers (e.g., [Schank & Abelson 77, Dahlgren 88]). <p> A discourse segment representation must be able to maintain three intersegment relations simultaneously. A similar partitioning of discourse relations is discussed in <ref> [Mann & Thompson 88] </ref>. Of course, there is no guarantee that the relations collected are indeed the "right" and only ones. <p> For example, in: "The new Tech Report abstracts are now in the journal area of the library near the abridged dictionary.

This essential aspect of interpersonal relations is reflected in the RST definitions <ref> [Mann & Thompson 88] </ref> of, say, * Evidence: The reader's comprehending the satellite increases his belief of the nucleus. * Motivation: Comprehending the satellite increases the reader's desire to perform the action presented in the nucleus.

Reference-contexts: One of the first text generators that took discourse structure into account explicitly was TEXT <ref> [McKeown 85] </ref>. The system contained schemas, predefined representations of a stereotypical paragraph structures which acted as templates to mandate the content and order of the clauses in a paragraph; coherence was achieved by the correct nesting and filling-in of a schema. <p> In the former, almost every clause is governed by a separate intention, while in the latter, large portions of the text serve a single discourse intention (often, Describe) and are organized under a considerable tree of discourse structure relations. Texts generated by TEXT <ref> [McKeown 85] </ref> and the RST structurer are both of this type. Texts generated by PEA [Moore 89] and TEXPLAN [Maybury 90] are explanations, with a rich subgoal structure. To accommodate both types, the definition of discourse segments in Section 4 associates both intentions and structural relations with each discourse segment. <p> Similarly, fossilized discourse structures that represent formulaic texts (such as encyclopedia entries and business reports) are called schemas <ref> [McKeown 85] </ref>. From several attempts to plan longer texts, it became clear that systems without some explicit representation of the structure of longer spans of text than single paragraphs are not feasible in practise. <p> There is simply too much variability in text plans or discourse structure relations; as plan and relation libraries grow, the number of possible texts grows alarmingly (as one would expect, given the plasticity of language). So, as argued in for example <ref> [McKeown 85, Mann 87, Rambow 90, Mooney et al. 90] </ref>, one should capture the idiosyncratic regularities of discourse structure, which may depend on genre, domain, or even simply custom, in schemas and use them as frozen plans by simple schema instantiation. <p> This treatment has been adopted in some form or another by most text structure planners and some schema appliers; the schema planner TEXT <ref> [McKeown 85] </ref> and the EES and TEXPLAN planners, for example, label some subgoals optional. This hybrid approach combines the complementary strengths of schemas and plans. Several open issues remain. As yet no representation for schemas captures well the underlying semantic and rhetorical interrelations of the parts. <p> These rules are however not sensitive to discourse structure, and when used for text generation more specific rules are needed. For the TEXT generator, for example, McKeown had to add an additional focus shift rule <ref> [McKeown 85] </ref>. Later, McCoy and Cheng generalized the linear operation of focus shift rules using a construct called a Focus Tree, which represents a focused concept at each node with as its branches all possible topic continuations [McCoy & Cheng 88, McCoy 85].

Reference-contexts: research community: What information should a text planner properly use? What information should appear at the branch points of a discourse structure? Is there a real difference between "intentional" and "discourse-structural" information? If so, are both types needed, and how do they interact? These questions are still being debated; see <ref> [Moore & Pollack 93] </ref>. Neither the initial RST-based approach nor the later experiments are wholly satisfactory in this regard. Certainly, for the selection and overall organization of material in plan-based hierarchicalizable discourse, text plans should somehow express the speaker's communicative intentions.

Reference-contexts: Approaching the problem of discourse structure from several intellectual sub-fields, various researchers have produced somewhat more extensive lists of intersegment relations | from philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g., <ref> [Quirk & Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85, Martin 92] </ref>) to computational linguists (e.g., [Hobbs 79, Mann & Thompson 88]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers (e.g., [Schank & Abelson 77, Dahlgren 88]).

Reference-contexts: There is simply too much variability in text plans or discourse structure relations; as plan and relation libraries grow, the number of possible texts grows alarmingly (as one would expect, given the plasticity of language). So, as argued in for example <ref> [McKeown 85, Mann 87, Rambow 90, Mooney et al. 90] </ref>, one should capture the idiosyncratic regularities of discourse structure, which may depend on genre, domain, or even simply custom, in schemas and use them as frozen plans by simple schema instantiation.

Reference-contexts: Though schemas remain a clear and popular method of generating multisentence texts today (see for example <ref> [Rambow & Korelsky 92] </ref>), their utility is limited because of their essential shortcoming: the lack of representation of the purpose of each part in the whole. <p> text planning systems of several researchers for a variety of domains (aside from the author's text structurer, EPICURE [Dale 88], the EES text planner [Moore & Swartout 90, Moore 89, Paris 90], TEXPLAN [Maybury 90], EDGE [Cawsey 90], SPOKESMAN [Meteer 90], PIT [Kreyss & Novak 90], POPEL [Reithinger 91], JOYCE <ref> [Rambow & Korelsky 92] </ref> and others) and taking as far as possible into account the theoretical work of [Grosz & Sidner 86, Asher 92, 11 Polanyi 88] and the work on intention recognition [Allen & Perrault 80, Litman 85, Pollack 86, Lambert & Carberry 91], the following general assertions about the

Reference-contexts: Several research efforts are investigating the nature and role of participants' beliefs and intentions [Pollack 86, Cohen & Levesque 90, Grosz & Sidner 90, Lochbaum 91], and much effort is focused on the types of plans that underlie this type of discourse (see <ref> [Litman 85, Lambert & Carberry 91, Ramshaw 91] </ref>). Most of these theories postulate several levels of plans, each level handling a distinct phenomenon (discourse management, domain knowledge, etc.). 4 Theory (DRT) [Kamp 81], and that of [Polanyi 88, Reichman 85, Cohen 83, Heim 83].

Reference-contexts: The effectiveness of these additions to the basic plan format is discussed at length in [Moore 89, Maybury 90]. Based on the above work, as well as on the EDGE planner [Cawsey 90], the planners of [Kreyss & Novak 90] and <ref> [Rosner & Stede 92] </ref>, and the more structurally oriented text representation in SPOKESMAN [Meteer 90], one can define a text plan P as a tuple (name, effects, constraints, preconditions, decomposition), where: * The name is a unique identifier of the segment. 15 * The effects are one or more communicative goals

Reference-contexts: Extending beyond dialogue-length discourse, [Van Dijk 72] discusses large-scale text organization and defines the notion of macro-structures and <ref> [Rumelhart 72] </ref> develops the idea of story grammars.

Reference-contexts: In the first attempt, the author operationalized some relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory as plans and created a text structure planner by simplifying a top-down incremental refinement system patterned on the AI planner NOAH <ref> [Sacerdoti 77] </ref>. The structurer planned coherent paragraphs in several domains to achieve communicative goals for affecting the hearer's knowledge in some way. It operated after some application program such as a data base or expert system and before the sentence generator Penman [Hovy 90c, Penman 89, Mann & Matthiessen 83]). <p> To perform their two major functions of content selection and organization, most of them use a variant of the basic top-down successive refinement algorithm such as employed in, say, NOAH <ref> [Sacerdoti 77] </ref>, without employing critics. The input goals contain the instruction to communicate some central portion (s) of information, and the final low-level actions are direct calls to a sentence generator, in appropriate order.

Reference-contexts: of discourse structure from several intellectual sub-fields, various researchers have produced somewhat more extensive lists of intersegment relations | from philosophers (e.g., [Toulmin 58]) to linguists (e.g., [Quirk & Greenbaum 73, Halliday 85, Martin 92]) to computational linguists (e.g., [Hobbs 79, Mann & Thompson 88]) to Artificial Intelligence researchers (e.g., <ref> [Schank & Abelson 77, Dahlgren 88] </ref>). Typically, their lists contain between five and fifty relations, and they argue that (at least) tens of interclausal relations are required to describe the structure of English discourse; one can call this the Profligate Position. <p> well as collecting precise, formal definitions for them, such as those of [Ivir et al. 80, Hobbs 79, Hobbs 90, Sanders et al. 92, Martin 92, Lascarides & Asher 91]. 20 5.3 Schemas In planning, scripts or macro-operators are useful compilations of plan structures formed out of oft-repeated stereotyped plans <ref> [Fikes et al. 72, Schank & Abelson 77] </ref>. Similarly, fossilized discourse structures that represent formulaic texts (such as encyclopedia entries and business reports) are called schemas [McKeown 85].

Reference-contexts: In fact, this is the standard realization in English. A study by Scott and de Souza <ref> [Scott & De Souza 90, De Souza et al. 89] </ref> of the use of several RST relations in both English and Brazilian Portuguese proposed a set of heuristics to govern sentence formation, including: 1. A Satellite can only be embedded in its Nucleus. 2.

Reference-contexts: several additional issues into account, including the complexity of the remainder of the discourse substructure, the desired overall style of the text (such as a general preference for simple or complex sentences), the rhythm of sentences (long alternating with short, as suggested in numerous books on good style, such as <ref> [Shepherd 26] </ref>). Although much more research remains to be done on this problem, intersegment discourse relations provide certain amount of help, either by indicating where alternatives of realization exist or by suggesting candidate syntactic realization forms.

Reference-contexts: Linguistic and computational investigations reveal strong constraints on what material may occupy the focus position as a text progresses. Three so-called focus shift rules expressing these constraints were formulated by Sidner <ref> [Sidner 83] </ref> (see also [Grosz 77, Grosz 81]). These rules are however not sensitive to discourse structure, and when used for text generation more specific rules are needed. For the TEXT generator, for example, McKeown had to add an additional focus shift rule [McKeown 85].

Reference-contexts: either used predefined large-scale knowledge structures that spanned the relevant content of the text, such as scripts (SAM [Cullingford 78], FRUMP [DeJong 79], BORIS [Dyer 83]), or else dynamically built up structures using rules particular to the purpose, such as the argument structure work of [Birnbaum et al. 80] and <ref> [Sycara 87] </ref>. One of the first text generators that took discourse structure into account explicitly was TEXT [McKeown 85].

Reference-contexts: What's more, the systematicity holds across various types of texts, genres, and registers of formality. It is found in books, articles, advertisements, papers, letters, and even memos. The information these devices convey supplements the primary content of the text. Though manuals of style (such as <ref> [CMS 82, APA 83, Van Leunen 79] </ref>) may seem relevant, they contain little more than precise descriptions of the preferred forms of textual devices in fact. We therefore classified textual devices into three broad classes | Depiction, Position, and Composition | and tried to provide functional descriptions of them.

Reference-contexts: The manual contains headings, term definitions signaled by italicized terms, enumerated lists, and so forth. After studies of instructional texts (including recipes, school textbooks, and manuals for cars, sewing machines, and video players) conducted at USC/ISI and the University of Nijmegen <ref> [Vossers 91, Arens et al. 92] </ref>, we concluded that certain textual formatting devices are highly correlated with specific configurations of the underlying text structure tree. For example, a series of nested Sequences, such as appears in Figure 10, is usually realized in the text as an enumerated list.
