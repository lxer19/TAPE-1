Reference-contexts: We use the folding, polarity, and projection concepts of Coifman & Meyer [8], Auscher, Weiss, & Wickerhauser <ref> [1] </ref>, and Meyer [36] to represent each projection in terms of a local trigonometric basis (also see Malvar [32] and Wickerhauser [59]). <p> Our notation will closely parallel that of Auscher, Weiss, & Wickerhauser <ref> [1] </ref>. For each concept, we create a corresponding software tool to implement that concept in our algorithms. This approach is similar to that of Wickerhauser [60]. These tools are CHAPTER 3. MEYER WAVELET TRANSFORMS 24 written in a pseudo-code manner, imitating Knuth's WEB language [25], to allow for easier reading. <p> See Auscher, Weiss, and Wickerhausser <ref> [1] </ref> for a more complete proof. The terminology `LST-III' derives from similar terminology in electrical engineering (see Rao and Yip [45]), which defines four types of discrete sine transforms (DST) and four types of discrete cosine transforms (DCT). <p> Figure 3.1 shows a graph of and j ^ j when is chosen to be -(x) = x 4 (35 84x + 70x 2 20x 3 ) on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. This wavelet is a C 1 (IR) function, has compact support in the frequency domain, and has a Fourier transform that is a member of C 4ffi . In general, the regularity of ^ will be same as that of -. <p> Letting b I 0 (~) j ^ (~)j, we can write ^ (~) = b I 0 (~)e i~ = b I 0 (~)fcos (~) i sin (~)g: In the language of Section 3.2, the function b I 0 () is a bell function over the interval I 0 = <ref> [ 1 2 ; 1] </ref> (as well as its symmetric reflection, [1; 1 2 ]). <p> ^ (~) = b I 0 (~)e i~ = b I 0 (~)fcos (~) i sin (~)g: In the language of Section 3.2, the function b I 0 () is a bell function over the interval I 0 = [ 1 2 ; 1] (as well as its symmetric reflection, <ref> [1; 1 2 ] </ref>). The bell b I 0 is only supported on I 0 in a `moral' sense, in that it is allowed to overlap the interval by * 0 = 1 6 to the left and * 0 0 = 2* 0 = 1 3 to the right. <p> This suggests, as has been shown explicitly by Meyer [36] and AWW <ref> [1] </ref>, that the Meyer wavelets can be represented in the frequency domain through their real and imaginary parts, by using local sine and cosine bases of (; +) and (+; ) polarities (LST-III and LCT-III in Section 3.2). <p> Functions in L 2 (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>) Let f now be a periodic function in L 2 ([0; 1]), and define the periodized Meyer wavelet on [0; 1] to be j;k (x) l for j 2 ZZ + and k = 0; 1; : : : ; 2 j 1. Figure 3.2 shows some examples of these periodized wavelets. Note that the collection f ffi j;k g forms a complete orthonormal system. <p> The fact that the operation P I ffi j is indeed a projection, as defined in the previous section, with all of the related properties, can be shown rigorously through a set of arguments revolving around the Poisson summation formula. Such an approach involves unwrapping the periodic functions on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to the real line, and proving the existence of a typical commutative diagram relating the projections in the two settings. Functions on the Discrete Circle Suppose now that we observe data ff (t=n)g n1 t=0 , where n = 2 J for some J 2. <p> MEYER WAVELET TRANSFORMS 42 Functions in L 2 (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>) As we did with the `mother' wavelets, begin by defining the periodized `father' Meyer wavelet on [0; 1] as ffi X j;k (x + l); for j 2 ZZ + and k = 0; 1; : : : ; 2 j 1. Figure 3.4 shows some examples. <p> Following Gao [22], we use polynomial functions -p () 2 C p (IR), of degree 2p + 1, on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. These can be derived as -p (x) = x p+1 k=0 for unique coefficients fb 0 ; : : : ; b k g. <p> CHAPTER 4. APPLICATIONS OF MEYER TRANSFORM ALGORITHMS 65 The evaluation was done using the boxcar function f (x) = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 0; if x 2 [0; 1 1; if x 2 ( 1 4 ) 4 ; 1] since this function is periodic on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and is constant except for two jump discontinu ities. Only wavelets whose support contains the points 1 4 or 3 4 should have significantly nonzero coefficients. <p> Such a phenomenon has been observed in comparing Daubechies wavelet transforms and discrete cosine packet transforms (Donoho [13]). A timing study will be conducted to address this issue. Vectors containing dis-cretiztions of the curve y = sin (2x), x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, will be computed, with lengths n = 2 a ; : : : ; 2 b . The D6 Daubechies and Meyer forward transforms will be computed 10 times each, for each value of n. <p> Using the usual convention of envisioning the output matrix as a discretization of the unit square <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 , Figure 5.2 shows schematically how the values should be sampled in the cases of j = 1 and 2. CHAPTER 5. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WVD IN TOMOGRAPHY 78 Note that our multiresolution analogue of the FBP algorithm really is just that. <p> By convention, the object of interest is taken to be centered within the unit circle. The grid f (x i ; y j )g i;j is therefore taken to be a sampling of the square <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 , which circumscribes the unit circle. Since the values u = x i cos () + y j sin () are often not directly observed for a given angle , we use simple linear interpolation to obtain them. <p> Since the function f approaches a point source as ! 0 + , the backprojection of Kf should approximate 1 p x 2 +y 2 . Multiplying the backprojected data by p should produce a matrix of approximately uniform values over <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 . Figure 5.3 shows this normalized backprojection, both from the perspective of a 3D mesh plot and an image. The mesh plot shows that while the result has a uniform trend overall (except at the corners), the surface is quite rough. <p> Also specified by the user is the degree of the auxiliary window function for the underlying Meyer wavelets. The window function is defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to be a polynomial of degree deg. The larger deg, the smoother the wavelets in the frequency APPENDIX A. 100 domain. In two dimensions, the input array, ymat, is transformed to an empirical wavelet coefficient array, wmat, of equal size. <p> For simplicity, the former was taken to be centered at the origin and contained within the unit circle. Reconstructions took the form of pixel arrays of size 2 J fi 2 J , for integer J &gt; 3, covering the area <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 with equisized squares. Each pixel value is interpreted as the value of the image at the center of the corresponding square. Two types of tomographic data collection were simulated, both from the field of medical imaging. <p> Hamming Filt.m Multiplies a vector by a Hamming window. Parzen Filt.m Multiplies a vector by a Parzen window. Butter Filt.m Multiplies a vector by a Butterworth window. Rect Filt.m Multiplies a vector by a rectangle window.

Simple linear interpolation is used. <p> Appendix C We comment briefly on issues related to translating certain software tools defined in this thesis into working code. In Chapter 3, we created a set of tools which implemented key concepts of Auscher, Weiss, and Wickerhauser <ref> [1] </ref> for use with our Meyer wavelet transform algorithms. We chose not to write these tools in the format of a standard programming language, but rather in a pseudo-code manner, imitating Knuth's WEB language [25], so as to improve readability.

Reference-contexts: Usually f is assumed to be in L 2 (IR d ), for d = 1 or 2. The goal in these problems is to recover f from the observations fy (u)g u2U through some method of inversion. Reviews of such problems may be found in Bertero <ref> [4] </ref>, O'Sullivan [42], and Wahba [57].

Reference-contexts: A key step in their approach is the insertion of a second wavelet transform into the process which essentially diagonalizes the filtering operator in the manner of Beylkin et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. In the presence of noisy data, they regularize their solution by calculating maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimates of the object to be backprojected.

Reference-contexts: This includes work by Luettgen [29] on regularization of ill-posed inverse problems, as well as Miller and Willsky [37] in an application to geology. Of particular interest to us is the work of Bhatia et al. <ref> [6] </ref>, in which multiscale methods are used to perform tomographic reconstruction.

The latter have also explored the use of wavelets in limited angle tomography [48], as has Olson [41]. <p> Hence, although the authors do not comment explicitly on this point, denoising appears to be accomplished in the same manner as the traditional BFP approach, but in the wavelet domain. A decidedly different approach is taken by Bhatia et al. <ref> [6] </ref> using wavelet-based multiscale techniques. These authors also work within the BFP framework, but choose to filter the data prior to computing a one-dimensional discrete orthonormal wavelet transform at each angle.

Reference-contexts: Since the FFT is often implemented in hardware, it is conceivable that the Meyer transforms could be as fast, if not faster, than the Daubechies transforms, especially for large n. Such a phenomenon has been observed in comparing Daubechies wavelet transforms and discrete cosine packet transforms (Donoho <ref> [13] </ref>). A timing study will be conducted to address this issue. Vectors containing dis-cretiztions of the curve y = sin (2x), x 2 [0; 1], will be computed, with lengths n = 2 a ; : : : ; 2 b .

Reference-contexts: goal in this dissertation to develop similar methods for the inverse problems mentioned above that exhibit comparable advantages over traditional linear inversion techniques. 1.3 Wavelets and Homogeneous Operators The framework within which we work is that of the wavelet-vaguelette decomposition (WVD), a wavelet analogue of the singular value decomposition (SVD) <ref> [14] </ref>. The WVD uses wavelets and vaguelettes (almost wavelets) to decompose the operator K, instead of the eigenfunctions used by the SVD. This suggests that the WVD should be better at representing spatially variable functions. <p> CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 6 1.4 Related Work Although the area is still in its infancy, there are already a number of researchers making sizable contributions to the use of wavelets in linear inverse problems. In addition to Donoho's original work on the wavelet-vaguelette decomposition <ref> [14] </ref>, there has been considerable work on operator biorthogonal decompositions. Lemarie [27] and Daubechies [9] have developed biorthogonal decompositions of the differentiation operator. Jawerth and Sweldens [24] [55] have decomposed variable-coefficient differential operators using biorthogonal decompositions. Also, Y. <p> Hence, although f may be a function that can be efficiently represented by wavelets, we cannot recover f from X X hKf; j;k i j;k ; (which is, of course, actually just Kf for well behaved K). Donoho <ref> [14] </ref> created the wavelet-vaguelette decomposition (WVD) in response to these difficulties. His framework allows one to represent f by an orthonormal wavelet basis, and to represent Kf by an associated near-orthonormal basis of `almost' wavelets, called vaguelettes.

Reference-contexts: Finally, simple nonlinear methods of denoising, based on thresholding of the wavelet coefficients, have been proven to be nearly optimal for a number of tasks across a wide range of function classes.

Reference-contexts: Many of the software tools necessary for implementing this algorithm are available or can be coded with some effort. Various methods for computing discrete backprojections can be found throughout the tomographic imaging community (e.g. Huesman et al. <ref> [23] </ref>). Our simple versions use linear interpolation and are described in Appendix A. Algorithms for computing the necessary 2D FFTs are implemented in numerous software packages, including both `S' and Matlab. <p> CHAPTER 5. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WVD IN TOMOGRAPHY 86 As a comparison, we also computed reconstructions from each set of data using the traditional FBP method. A Parzen window was used, with 0.5 cutoff. See Huesman et al. <ref> [23] </ref> for a discussion and implementation of the FBP and other traditional methods. The reconstructions using both methods are displayed together in Figure 5.10. Note that the WVD reconstructions appear to be characterized by a noticeably greater reduction in the overall noise level. <p> We expect that this quality will be improved in the future by making two important changes. Improving Overall Reconstruction Quality ) Increase the sophistication of our treatment of sampling and discretization issues. ) Take advantage of more accurate discrete backprojection algorithms currently in use (e.g. Huesman et al. <ref> [23] </ref>). CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION 96 It should be noted that, despite our disappointment, because the same (simple) back-projection algorithms were used for both the WVD and the FBP reconstructions in Chapter 5, the comparisons therein are made on equal grounds.

Reference-contexts: Researchers at MIT recently have developed a sizable body of work using "multi-scale" methods, based on wavelets. This includes work by Luettgen <ref> [29] </ref> on regularization of ill-posed inverse problems, as well as Miller and Willsky [37] in an application to geology.

Reference-contexts: Computation of the forward and inverse DWTs would naturally be expected to require O (n 2 ) operations. Fortunately, a pyramid filtering algorithm due to Mallat <ref> [30] </ref> reduces this cost to only O (n) operations. This is especially impressive when compared with the O (n log (n)) operations required for the FFT.

It is with respect to these trigonometric bases that the actual computations are done, yielding a set of algorithms composed of specific discrete sine and cosine transforms, coupled with simple folding and windowing operations. We will derive our algorithms in the context of one-dimensional data.

In our medical imaging examples of the next section, we use a 2D computer phantom as our object of interest. Specifically, we use the phantom of Shepp & Logan <ref> [49] </ref>, variations of which have been a standard for nearly 20 years now. Figure 5.6 shows this phantom on a 256 fi 256 grid, as well as noiseless projection data obtained by calculating a discrete set of line integrals with respect to the various circles and ellipses. <p> This corresponds exactly to the distributional assumptions underlying our development of thresholds for denoising PET data with wavelet shrinkage methods. A slightly more realistic method follows Shepp and Logan <ref> [49] </ref> in which emissions are simulated from the underlying intensity function via rejection sampling. Each emission is then assigned to a particular tube by choosing a random orientation for the line of flight of its photons.
