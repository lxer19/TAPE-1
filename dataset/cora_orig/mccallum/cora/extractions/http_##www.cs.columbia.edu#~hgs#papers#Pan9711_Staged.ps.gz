Title: Staged Refresh Timers for RSVP  
Author: Ping Pan, Henning Schulzrinne 
Note: KeywordsRSVP, soft state.  
Abstract: In the current RSVP design [2], there is no reliability mechanism for control message delivery. Instead RSVP relies on periodic refresh between routers to maintain reservation states. This approach has several potential problems in a congested network. End systems send PATH and RESV messages to set up RSVP connections. If the first PATH or RESV message is accidentally lost, an upstream router will have to wait for the entire duration of a refresh cycle to retransmit another copy of the lost message. If a tear-down message (a PATHTEAR or a RESVTEAR) is dropped at a congested link, a reservation will not be removed until the RSVP cleanup timer expires. The above problems may not be acceptable for certain applications. In this paper, we present a RSVP extension to support fast and reliable message delivery. The extension is backward compatible and is easy to be adapted to the current implementation. In the paper, we will address several design issues extensively.

Reference-contexts: V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS We believe that RSVP message delivery mechanism requires some degree of reliability guarantee. One way of improving reliability is to grant some minimal bandwidth for RSVP messages to protect them from congestion losses, as being suggested in Reference <ref> [2] </ref>. However it may require additional functions at both sending and receiving nodes. And it is not clear how it can be backward compatible. In this paper, we presented a mechanism that enhances the current RSVP message delivery and is completely backward compatible.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4 shows the accumulative loss probability for both fixed and staged refresh mechanism. The fixed refresh rate is 1/30. The initial fast refresh rate is 1/3. The incremental value for staged refresh is 0.3. The message loss probability for a single message to 2% from reference <ref> [7] </ref>. The reason behind the loss reduction is that if more messages are sent within a given time, the delivery will be more likely to success.
