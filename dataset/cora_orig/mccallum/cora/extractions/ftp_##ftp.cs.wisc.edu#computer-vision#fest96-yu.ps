Abstract: The projected deformation of stationary contours and markings on object surfaces is analyzed in this paper. It is shown that given a marked point on a stationary contour, an active observer can move deterministically to the osculating plane for that point by observing and controlling the deformation of the projected contour. Reaching the osculating plane enables the observer to recover the object surface shape along the contour as well as the Frenet frame of the contour. Complete local surface recovery requires either two intersecting surface contours and the knowledge of one principle direction, or more than two intersecting contours. To reach the osculating plane, two strategies involving both pure translation and a combination of translation and rotation are analyzed. Once the Frenet frame for the marked point on the contour is recovered, the same information for all points on the contour can be recovered by staying on osculating planes while moving along the contour. It is also shown that occluding contours and stationary contours deform in a qualitatively different way and the problem of discriminating between these two types of contours can be resolved before the recovery of local surface shape. Natural objects are full of textures of all kinds, providing qualitatively different cues about surface shape. Different kinds of texture require different methods for analysis. One kind of surface texture, stationary surface contours, constrains surface shape in a way very different from blob-liketexture. These stationary contours are one-dimensional curvilinear markings on the object surface, which, unlike occluding contours, do not slide across the surface as the vantage point changes [4] and, hence, only constrain the surface along a single dimension like a strip for a smooth surface [10]. Consequently, stationary contours have been studied mostly in the context of qualitative surface characterization [5, 9, 12, 14]. In contrast, since the observation of Barrow and Tenebaum [1] that occluding contours constrain surface orientation uniquely even from a single viewpoint, this kind of contour has been the focus of considerable research to quantitatively characterize the surface from one-dimensional curvilinear features.

Reference-contexts: We also need three parameters to characterize how the distance (metrics) is measured on the surface and an additional three parameters to measure how the surface tangent turns away from the surface locally. Since these six parameters are not independent, but tied by a set of three compatibility equations <ref> [6] </ref>, we need a minimum of three equations relating these parameters to completely characterize the local surface. The problem of recovering surface shape from contours is to derive these equations from a finite number of observations. <p> p ; and the Frenet frame carry with them intrinsic information that allows us to distinguish stationary contours from other non-stationary ones. 5.2: Surface Shape Recovery From Multiple Contours For a given local parameterization, the six parameters in the first and second fundamental forms that satisfy the three compatibility equations <ref> [6] </ref> completely determine the surface shape up to a rigid transformation. This is the fundamental theorem of the local theory of surfaces. Hence, there are three degrees of freedom that need to be fixed in order to determine the local surface shape. <p> In the first case, we have three Euler equations to solve all required parameters. In the second case, since the third contour will intersect at least one of the first two contours, we can parallel transport <ref> [6, 10] </ref> the tangent and curvature along this third contour from the additional intersection point to the first intersection point and then solve the set of three Euler equations. The accuracy of this parallel transport depends on the curvature of the surface along which we make the parallel transport. <p> Since we did not attempt to find the directions of the principle curvatures, it is assumed that these two contours are actually in the principle directions. Under this assumption, all six parameters of the first and second fundamental forms can be computed <ref> [6] </ref> and we can parameterize the local surface by using the two tangents as two basis vectors and the intersecting point as the origin. To illustrate, we overlay on the surface members in the family of quadratic functions that have the same parameters at the point in Figure 8.

These differences enable us to discriminate between these two types of contours without first recovering the surface shape. The deformation of a stationary contour occurs for two reasons.
