Abstract: With the new rise of applications such as multimedia, the networking environment has to provide more and more bandwidth and should be able to meet the user requirement . The deployment of optical fibers with the emergence of the ATM technology which relies on a Virtual Call (VC) model is the necessary infrastructure to support these applications.. However, we believe that the QoS routeing for VC model has received little attention from the researcher community. In this paper, we propose to extend the classical method for packet switching, namely the distance vector and the link state method to cover these new user requirements. We present routeing architectures using route recording and source routeing which are based on "pre-computed" and "on-demand" routes. Simulation results are provided for the on-demand DV algorithm we propose.

Reference-contexts: However, the suggested solutions for loop avoidance for "DV-like" algorithms were usually related to SPF (Shortest-Path First) calculation which either prevents their adaptation to QoS based routeing <ref> [Awerb] </ref> or introduces a very poor performance [Garcia]. At the time being, the application of the DV in a VC/ QoS context implies that only detection techniques such as route recording are workable.

Reference-contexts: These inconsistencies are caused by the inherent delay existing in the distribution of routeing information. In a VC environment, since the route computed at the set up phase will be used during the whole lifetime of the VC, the routeing protocol should provide "loop free" routes in any circumstances <ref> [NajSal1] </ref>. For the LS, two cases are to be studied: either the route is calculated in a distributed way (e.g. each NN uses its complete topology map to compute the next step leading to the destination) or the entire route is calculated by a single NN (i.e. a border NN). <p> This solution implies that the whole route is transported in the packet establishing the route (source routeing). For the DV method, solutions have been proposed to avoid both transient and long term loops [MerlSeg] [Cheng] [JafMos] [ZauGar] [Garcia] [Humblet] or to detect long term loops (complete route recording) ([GuNajSal] <ref> [NajSal1] </ref>, ISO/IEC 10747]).

However, a pre-computed method requires to execute in the order of O ( v * * q . d ) times the route calculation algorithm in each node concerned.

Reference-contexts: The combination of QoS requirements and VC switching techniques leads to a new class of protocols we call "VC/ QoS" algorithms. The routeing protocols which have been designed in the datagram context only provide the applications with QoS values corresponding to the best effort semantics <ref> [NajSal2] </ref>. <p> In this context, the routeing is involved in two separate levels: Intra-RD (the route within a domain) and Inter-RD (the routes linking the RDs). For the purpose of this paper, only the Intra RD case will be discussed. The Inter RD routeing in a VC/QoS environment is addressed in <ref> [NajSal2] </ref>. Finally, we define the following terms that we will use in the next sections: - Border NN: an NN with a least one HS attached. - Transit NN: an NN with no HS attached. <p> In particular, this increases the number of potential routes between the calling and the called hosts. It is also well suited for supporting multi-point and conference calls. This model has been proposed in <ref> [NajSal2] </ref> in a QoS negotiation context and in [RSVP] for a multi-point environment. 4 Routeing architecture for high speed QOS environment 4.1 Basic algorithms The SPF methods used for packet switching routeing can be classified in two main families: the Distance Vector (DV) algorithms (e.g. <p> However, having in mind the reverse model for VC setup as described in section3, it is possible to initiate a DV-like algorithm from the source NN by sending a message indicating the required QoS.

To update these QoSs and forward the message accordingly to the QoS it currently supports. To drop this message since it does not support the QoS required. A node also discards a message whenever a loop is detected.

Reference-contexts: NN must store the distance to every other adjacent NN (i.e. a storage complexity of O (m.g)) On the other hand, with the basic LS technique, when an NN is aware of local topological changes, it constructs an LS PDU (Link State PDU,which will be broadcasted in the whole RD <ref> [Rosen] </ref>). This will allow an NN to maintain the complete topological map of the network. The storage complexity is of O (m.n.g) for the entire topology of the RD and O (m.d) for every SPF route (n is the number of Systems = HS+NN).
