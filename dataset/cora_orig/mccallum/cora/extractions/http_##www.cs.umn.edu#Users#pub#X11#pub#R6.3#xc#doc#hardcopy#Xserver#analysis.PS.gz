Title: Analysis of the X Protocol for Security Concerns Draft Version 2  
Author: David P. Wiggins 
Date: May 10, 1996  
Affiliation: X Consortium, Inc.  
Abstract: This paper attempts to list all instances of certain types of security problems in the X Protocol. Issues with authorization are not addressed. We assume that a malicious client has already succeeded in connecting, and try to assess what harm it can then do. We propose modifications to the semantics of the X Protocol to reduce these risks.
