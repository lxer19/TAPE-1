Abstract: The performance of individual agents in a group depends critically on the quality of information available to it about local and global goals and resources. In general it is assumed that the more accurate and up-to-date the available information, the better is the expected performance of the individual and the group. This conclusion can be challenged in a number of scenarios. We investigate the use of limited information by agents in choosing between one of several different options, and conclude that if agents are deliberately kept ignorant about any number of options, the entire group can converge faster to a stable and optimal configuration. We also demonstrate how a couple of coalition formation schemes improves the rate of convergence and conclude that a variable, rather than fixed, coalition formation mechanism is more effective.

Reference-contexts: Not limited to artificial domains discussed here, we find an analogy of the resource utilization problem within the dynamics of human society. We often observe social trends in human societies where the populace tend to look for opportunities and search for better openings within a closed environment <ref> (Bartos 1967) </ref>. For instance, it is obvious and practical under rational thinking to shift for greener pastures, move for better jobs with less competition, to search for resources with less utilization, etc. The self-interested nature of an individual leads to choices that are perceived to improve rewards from the environment.

Reference-contexts: We provide a probabilistic analysis explaining this phenomena. We further plan to study the effects of varying amounts of information on the convergence process of these agent groups. Related Work Hogg and Huberman <ref> (Hogg & Huberman 1991) </ref> have analyzed a resource utilization problem similar to the one mentioned in the previous section to study effects of local decisions on group behavior (Hogg & Huberman 1991; Kephart, Hogg, & Huberman 1989). <p> They also provide an analysis of how agents that monitor system behavior and accordingly adjust their performance can bring the system closer to a stable behavior. Hogg and Huberman <ref> (Hogg & Huberman 1991) </ref> present a robust procedure for suppressing system oscillations using a reward mechanism based on performance. We share their motivation of achieving stability in a multiagent system when individual agents are making decisions based on self-interest.

Reference-contexts: This assumption of relying only on the current state and ignoring the effects of past history on decision making is also used in Markovian analysis <ref> (Howard 1971) </ref>. This study attempts to verify the following conjecture: limited knowledge of the environment can be beneficial for an agent in comparison to complete global knowledge.

Kephart et al. <ref> (Kephart, Hogg, & Huberman 1989) </ref> show how system parameters like decision rate can produce stable equilibria, damped oscillations, persistent oscillations, or can burst into a chaotic regime.
