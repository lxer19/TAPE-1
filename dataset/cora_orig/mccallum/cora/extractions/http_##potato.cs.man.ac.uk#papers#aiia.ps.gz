Reference-contexts: The common description must be rich enough to be all encompassing, and the mappings will be incomplete, imprecise and changeable as sources have missing data or are altered. As sources are described they should be classified with respect to one another to support imprecise cross-mappings <ref> [1] </ref>. Schema consistency checking: the consistency of ER schemas can be checked by translating the schema into a terminological framework with a rigorous semantics such as a Description Logic [8]. <p> In addition, terminologies can be used as mediators between information sources the server can provide information about the concrete representation of a conceptual definition in a particular information source. These mappings to other representations can be seen as examples of extrinsic information services <ref> [1] </ref>. One could argue that it is simply the conceptual services which should be encapsulated in the server. However, as we discuss in Section 4, services such as linguistic services are essential if applications are to render conceptual definitions in a readable format. <p> For example the user can now ask for Motifs which occur in Aardvark Proteins. The system rewrites the query expression to requests to appropriate sources. Source wrappers deal with differences in source format. DLs have been used for information integration in this way in projects such as SIMS <ref> [1] </ref>. It would be unreasonable to expect users to interact directly with the DL a form based interface is provided which allows the user to build up queries interactively and in a graphical fashion.

Reference-contexts: Individuals can be asserted to be instances of particular concepts and pairs of individuals can be asserted to be instances of particular roles. 2.1 Reasoning Services DLs provide a variety of services <ref> [2] </ref> that make them particularly attractive as models for describing semi-structured and complex information [5]. Subsumption The power of DLs is derived from the automatic determination of subsumption between compositional descriptions.

Reference-contexts: The separation of the biological terminological model into a networked resource facilitates the use of the terminology in projects other than Tambis the model is now being used in tasks such as annotation checking and function prediction. 4.2 STARCH STARCH <ref> [3] </ref> is a project which aims to use a terminological model to represent semantic metadata for picture archives. Traditionally, keywords or free text annotations have been used to represent the content of images in catalogues, but these have their problems as discussed in [3]. <p> checking and function prediction. 4.2 STARCH STARCH <ref> [3] </ref> is a project which aims to use a terminological model to represent semantic metadata for picture archives. Traditionally, keywords or free text annotations have been used to represent the content of images in catalogues, but these have their problems as discussed in [3]. Representing the terms in a DL brings advantages relating to the coherency and consistency of the model, allows the support of multiple views through multi-axial classification, and can provide a space around which the user can navigate, supporting serendipitous browsing.

Reference-contexts: This leads to two possible forms of referencing concepts: persistent global references, interchangeable between servers, and local references for a particular server. We can also see the requirement for transient but fast session-dependent references for a particular server. Referencing policies are discussed in more detail in <ref> [4] </ref>. References provide a naming service, with local references forming a local name space (valid for a particular server) and global references a global name space (valid for all servers).

Reference-contexts: In particular, a DL supports hierarchical classification through the use of a well-defined notion of subsumption. For a full description of DLs and their uses, see <ref> [5] </ref>. DLs are closely related to propositional modal and dynamic logics recent work has provided a sound formal basis for several DLs along with results concerning their complexity and expressiveness [6, 18]. A DL models an application domain in terms of concepts (classes), roles (relations) and individuals (objects). <p> Individuals can be asserted to be instances of particular concepts and pairs of individuals can be asserted to be instances of particular roles. 2.1 Reasoning Services DLs provide a variety of services [2] that make them particularly attractive as models for describing semi-structured and complex information <ref> [5] </ref>. Subsumption The power of DLs is derived from the automatic determination of subsumption between compositional descriptions. Given two conceptual definitions A and B, we can determine whether A subsumes B, in other words whether every instance of B is necessarily an instance of A. <p> Concept Services. Along with maintaining the representation of the concepts, the services include operations which both extend and query the content of the model; these operations are commonly known as TELL and ASK <ref> [5] </ref>. Operations for extension include the introduction of new primitive concepts, the introduction of new relations, and the addition of new constraints on roles.

Baker, Andy Brass, Sean Bechhofer, and Robert Stevens. </author> <title> Transparent Access to Multiple Biological Information Sources. </title> <note> Submitted for publication to: Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, </note> <year> 1998. </year>
Reference-contexts: In order to access the sources, users must know both the location of the source, and the access method e.g. SQL for databases, appropriate commands for tools, or some searching mechanism based on the format of a file. This is unsatisfactory, leading to underuse of these distributed sources. TAMBIS <ref> [11] </ref> aims to answer these problems by acting as a single interface to the information sources, providing the illusion of a single source. This is done through the use of a conceptual model of the biological domain, expressed in a DL.

Reference-contexts: A terminology server approach is essential if we are to build generic plug and play mixed systems, for example if a semantic hypermedia system is to use the TeS as a link resolution service along with conventional link following or information retrieval services <ref> [15] </ref>. 3.1 Services The services provided by a TeS can be broken down into three main types: pure ontological or concept services, language or linguistic services, and extrinsic information services. Concept Services.

Reference-contexts: Content-description of semi-structured information: the description of the content of information instances such as documents or images cannot necessarily be strictly typed at the outset unlike classical database schema where instances populate a predefined, static and complete schema. Application examples include: digital libraries and document/image archives <ref> [19] </ref>, broadcast video archives [10], the World Wide Web and open hypermedia systems [7].
