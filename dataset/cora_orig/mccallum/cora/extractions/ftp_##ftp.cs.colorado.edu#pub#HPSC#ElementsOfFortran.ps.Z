WAGENER. </author> <year> [1992]. </year> <title> Fortran 90 Handbook. </title> <publisher> Intertext Publications. McGraw-Hill Book Company, </publisher> <address> New York, NY. </address>
Reference-contexts: Fortran 90 and HPF (High Performance Fortran) are more recent versions of Fortran that include vector operations and other features for high performance computing. Descriptions of Fortran 90 can be found in Programmers Guide to Fortran 90 [Brainerd et al. 90] and in the more complete Fortran 90 Handbook <ref> [Adams et al. 92] </ref>. A reference for HPF is The High Performance Fortran Handbook [Koelbel et al. 94]. This tutorial consists of four parts. Section 2 is a brief overview of Fortran. Section 3 contains basic definitions. Section 4 is a description of Fortran statements, organized alphabetically.
