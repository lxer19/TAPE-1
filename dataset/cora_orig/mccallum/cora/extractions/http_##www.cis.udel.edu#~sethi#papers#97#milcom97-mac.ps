Abstract: Addressing the problem of timely packet transmission in a wireless soft real-time system such as one would find on the battlefield, we present five splitting protocols that take packet deadlines into account. Three are blocked access and two are free access algorithms. Mathematical models of the algorithms are developed, and compared with simulations. We show, as expected, that the blocked access algorithms usually offer higher success rates than the free access versions. Of the two best performing blocked access protocols, performance differences are slight on a lightly loaded channel. Under heavy load, however, one is shown to have better performance, and thus would be the best choice for implementation.

Reference-contexts: It is not nec-essarily new hardware technology that is needed, but new channel access techniques. BACKGROUND The most popular random access MAC techniques are Aloha <ref> [1] </ref> and Ethernet or variants of them. Their shortcoming in the real-time environment is clear: collisions result in a random transmission order of involved packets. Since this offers potentially unbounded access times at worst, and transmission scheduling ignoring time constraints at best, it is undesirable in real-time settings.

However, when higher ranges are compared, the performances quickly diverge. Figure 6 graphs success rates for initial laxities in <ref> [2; T ] </ref>. We can see that as T increases, the blocked access algorithms perform better, whereas the free access version's performance worsens. CONCLUSIONS A real-time system meets its functional requirements not just by generating correct results, but by gener 4 ating correct and timely results.

Subsequently, Zhao et al. <ref> [4] </ref> proposed a splitting protocol that always performed in simulation at least as well as the virtual time protocols and often better. Consequently, we pursue splitting protocols, though for use on wireless nets rather than CSMA-CD.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, we pursue splitting protocols, though for use on wireless nets rather than CSMA-CD. Algorithmically less complex CSMA-CD splitting protocols were presented for both hard and soft real-time systems by Arvind <ref> [5] </ref>, where protocol operations were simulated and some straightforward worst case performance analysis was presented. A similar protocol for wireless transmission of hard and non real-time data was analyzed in detail by Papantoni-Kazakos [6]. <p> In the soft real-time case, though, it is interesting to reconsider these algorithms because of the more involved departure process.

Hers is a hard real-time variant of the soft real-time protocol presented and analyzed by Paterakis et al. <ref> [7] </ref> described below. We combine the use of laxity, i.e., time until the packet expires, as the splitting variable with the splitting methodologies of traditional algorithms to create new splitting protocols for real-time use. <p> After the left half transmission is a non-collision, the CRA is applied the right half. Due to the nature of the CRA, two consecutive non-collisions indicate the end of a CRI. Blocked Access Real-Time Two Cell. Paterakis et al. <ref> [7] </ref> developed a CRA that uses random splitting as well as an arrival time based sliding window. Again, there are always only two subsets of split users. Upon collision, nodes flip a coin. On tails, say, nodes do not again transmit until a non-collision feedback is observed.
