Abstract: Our concern in this paper is with conjecturing diagnoses to explain what happened to a system, given a theory of system behaviour and some observed (aberrant) behaviour. We characterize what happened by introducing the notion of explanatory diagnoses in the language of the situation calculus. Explanatory diagnoses conjecture sequences of actions to account for a change in system behaviour. We show that determining an explanatory diagnosis is analogous to the classical AI planning task. As such, we exploit previous results on goal regression in the situation calculus to show that determining an explanatory diagnosis can be achieved by regression followed by theorem proving in the database describing what is known of the initial state of our system. Further, we show that in the case of incomplete information, determining explanatory diagnoses is an abductive plan synthesis task.

Reference-contexts: Different criteria have been proposed for determining the space of such candidate diagnoses. Within formal accounts of diagnosis, two widely accepted definitions of diagnosis are consistency-based diagnosis (e.g., (Reiter 1987), (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992)), and abductive explanation (e.g., (de Kleer, Mack-worth, & Reiter 1992), (Poole 1988), <ref> (Console & Torasso 1991) </ref>, (McIlraith 1994a)). <p> Compared to our traditional notion of what is wrong diagnoses, knowing what happened can more accurately capture the root cause of system malfunction, rather than its manifestations. In the spirit of previous foundational work in model-based diagnosis (MBD) (e.g., (Reiter 1987), <ref> (Console & Torasso 1991) </ref>, (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992)), this paper presents a mathematical characterization for the notion of explanatory diagnosis. <p> <ref> (Console & Torasso 1991) </ref>, (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992)), this paper presents a mathematical characterization for the notion of explanatory diagnosis. We take as our starting point the existing MBD research on characterizing diagnoses for static systems without a representation of actions (e.g., (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992), (Console & Torasso 1991), (Reiter 1987)). Next, we exploit a situation calculus representation scheme previously proposed by the author (McIlraith 1997a) that enables the integration of a representation of action with the representation of the behaviour of a static system. <p> We have not yet implemented our own abductive explanation generator for the situation calculus. Related Work As previously noted, this work has been influenced by formal characterizations of diagnosis for systems without an explicit representation of actions (e.g., (de Kleer, Mack-worth, & Reiter 1992), (Reiter 1987), <ref> (Console & Torasso 1991) </ref>). It has also been influenced by Reiter's work on the frame problem and the problem of temporal projection (Reiter 1992a).

Reference-contexts: In the latter case, generating an assumption-based explanatory diagnosis is analogous to an abductive planning problem, and we can use computational machinery for abduction to realize the computation of assumption-based explanatory diagnoses. We single out the work by Eshghi <ref> (Eshghi 1988) </ref> on abductive planning with event calculus as an example of abductive planning. While his representation and objectives are different from ours, his discussion of abductive planning illustrates the possibilities for the generation of assumption-based explanatory diagnoses.

Reference-contexts: According to Green <ref> (Green 1969) </ref>, a plan to achieve a goal G (s) is obtained as a side effect of proving Axioms j= 9s:G (s). The bindings for the situation variable s represent the sequence of actions. In our case, Axioms j= 9s:G (s) is analogous to j= 9s:OBS F (s). <p> As observed previously, generating a sequence of actions that constitutes an explanatory diagnosis for an observation OBS F is identical to generating a sequence of actions that constitutes a plan to achieve a goal 9s:OBS F (s). Thus, following the work on deductive plan synthesis (e.g., <ref> (Green 1969) </ref>), we can view the generation of explanatory diagnoses as a deductive plan synthesis problem that is realizable using theorem proving. As a side effect of proving 9s:OBS F (s), a theorem prover will generate bindings for s.

Reference-contexts: Representation Scheme Situation Calculus Language The situation calculus language we employ to axiomatize our domains is a sorted first-order language with equality. The sorts are of type A for primitive actions, S for situations, and D for everything else, including domain objects <ref> (Lin & Reiter 1994) </ref>. We represent each action as a (pos-sibly parameterized) first-class object within the language. Situations are simply sequences of actions. The evolution of the world can be viewed as a tree rooted at the distinguished initial situation S 0 . <p> The resultant representation of a system comprises both domain-independent and domain-specific axioms. The domain-independent axioms are the foundational axioms of the discrete situation calculus, found <ref> (Lin & Reiter 1994) </ref>. They are analogous to the axioms of Peano arithmetic, modified to define the branching structure of our situation tree, rather than the number line.

Reference-contexts: The Lloyd-Topor transformation <ref> (Lloyd 1987) </ref> must then be applied to convert this theory into Prolog clausal form. Later in this paper, we will advocate using Waldinger's notion of regression to rewrite axioms of our representation and simplify computation. This type of regression rewriting is precisely achieved by Pro-log's backwards chaining mechanism.

Reference-contexts: We take as our starting point the existing MBD research on characterizing diagnoses for static systems without a representation of actions (e.g., (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992), (Console & Torasso 1991), (Reiter 1987)). Next, we exploit a situation calculus representation scheme previously proposed by the author <ref> (McIlraith 1997a) </ref> that enables the integration of a representation of action with the representation of the behaviour of a static system. With this representation in hand, we provide a logical characterization for the task of determining what happened to a system. <p> Domain Representation: An Example In this section we briefly describe the representation scheme we use to characterize our system. The scheme, proposed in <ref> (McIlraith 1997a) </ref>, integrates a situation calculus theory of action with a MBD system description, SD (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992). The resultant representation of a system comprises both domain-independent and domain-specific axioms. The domain-independent axioms are the foundational axioms of the discrete situation calculus, found (Lin & Reiter 1994). <p> The resultant domain axiomatization T = T SC ^ T domain ^ T SS ^ T AP ^ T UNA ^ T DCA ^ T S 0 is described below. The representation is limited to a syntactically restricted but commonly occurring class of theories called solitary stratified theories <ref> (McIlraith 1997a) </ref>. Intuitively, the dependency graphs of the actions and state constraints of these theories contain no loops or cycles. It is also important to note that a completeness assumption is embedded in this representation. <p> It has also been influenced by Reiter's work on the frame problem and the problem of temporal projection (Reiter 1992a). With the exception of previous work by the author <ref> (McIlraith 1997a) </ref>, the research to date on diagnostic problem solving has not really addressed the problem of incorporating a representation of action into the representation of the behaviour of a system. As such, there is little related work that exploits a comprehensive representation of action. <p> We addressed this problem by providing a mathematical characterization of the notion of explanatory diagnosis in the context of a rich situation calculus representation, proposed in <ref> (McIlraith 1997a) </ref>. Observing that we often have incomplete information about our initial state, we also proposed the notions of assumption-based and potential explanatory diagnosis, to allow for the conjectured sequences of actions that constitute a diagnosis to be predicated on some other assumptions we choose to make about the world.

Following in the spirit of (Reiter 1991) and (Reiter 1992b), Definition 7 (Regression Operator R fl ) Given a set of successor state axioms, T SS composed of axioms of the following form P oss (a; s) [F (do (a; s)) F ]; (20) R fl [], the repeated regression of formula with respect to successor state axioms T <p> = R P oss [W 1 ] R P oss [W 2 ]: (29) Finally for any formula W containing no occurrence of predicate P oss, R P oss [W ] = W: (30) Next we adapt Reiter's results on the soundness and completeness of regression (Theorem 1, Theorem 2, <ref> (Reiter 1992b) </ref>) to our representation. They are presented in the following proposition. The theory init mentioned in the proposition below is a subset of containing only the initial database, and no information about successor situations. It also excludes the induction axiom in found .

Reference-contexts: The situation calculus language we employ in this paper is restricted to primitive, determinate actions. Our language does not include a representation of time, concurrency, or complex actions, but we believe the results presented herein can be extended to more expressive dialects of the situation calculus (e.g., <ref> (Reiter 1996) </ref>) without great difficulty. Domain Representation: An Example In this section we briefly describe the representation scheme we use to characterize our system. The scheme, proposed in (McIlraith 1997a), integrates a situation calculus theory of action with a MBD system description, SD (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992).

Reference-contexts: In the area of reasoning about action, research on temporal explanation and postdiction is also very much related to results on explanatory diagnosis (e.g., (Crawford & Ether-ington 1992), (Baker 1991)). Of particular note is research by Shanahan on temporal explanation in the situation calculus <ref> (Shanahan 1993) </ref>. While Shanahan also proposes the situation calculus as a representation language for axioma-tizing his domain, he does so without an axiomatic solution to the frame and ramification problems. As such these problems must be addressed coincidentally with generating explanatory diagnoses.

Reference-contexts: As we show in the sections to follow, our characterization establishes a direct link between explanatory diagnosis and planning, deductive plan synthesis and abductive planning. As a consequence of a completeness assumption embedded in our representation, we show how to exploit goal-directed reasoning in the form of regression <ref> (Waldinger 1977) </ref> in order to generate diagnoses. This completeness assumption also provides for an easy mapping of our situation calculus representation to Prolog. Representation Scheme Situation Calculus Language The situation calculus language we employ to axiomatize our domains is a sorted first-order language with equality. <p> The sequence of actions following HIST that determine s constitutes an explanatory diagnosis E. As is commonly done in planning tasks, we advocate exploiting regression (e.g., <ref> (Waldinger 1977) </ref>) to generate explanatory diagnoses. In this context, regression is a recursive rewriting procedure used to reduce the nesting of the do function in situation terms. We will show that generating explanatory diagnoses reduces to regression followed by entailment with respect to the initial database.
