Abstract: Various multimedia repositories are now distributed throughout the Internet and can be accessed via the World Wide Web tools. In such an environment, a challenging problem is to find the multimedia databases at distributed locations that are the most relevant to the user query. In this paper, we investigate approaches to the creation of a metadatabase and design of a search agent in a metaserver which supports the integrated access to various multimedia databases. The creation of the metadatabase formulates the metadata on the types of media data each multimedia database at a remote site houses and its query capabilities. The design of the search agent at metaserver accesses the metadatabase and control the distribution of user queries to relevant database sites through the site server. The search agent also directs interactive dialogue between the client and multimedia databases. The proposed metadatabase and search agent is designed and implemented in a web-based multimedia information retrieval environment.

Reference-contexts: Through these two steps of similarity comparisons, we determine the degree of similarity between the query pattern and database images. To better understand the relationships between these two similarity rates, we have conducted experiments on various types of images. Using the Brodatz Collection <ref> [Bro66] </ref>, we have demonstrated in [ZCA96] that images can be classified into different degree of clusters based on their similarity to a given image icon. <p> The information server generates information about individual templates passed by the metaserver. The database server retrieves the images matching the user query and sends them back to the metaserver. A testbed with three databases has been constructed from the Brodatz Collection <ref> [Bro66] </ref>, the VisTex database obtained from the MIT media lab, and a geographical database containing remotely sensed satellite images. Iconic images are randomly selected from image cuts. The result in the form of retrieved multimedia data is validated by the end user.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the GLOSS (Generalized Glossary of Servers) server [GGM95, GGMT94] keeps statistics on the available databases and estimates their potential applicability to a given query using Boolean and vector-space retrieval models of document retrieval.

Reference-contexts: One or more query class categories may be derived by selecting the closest templates. The mapping of each user query to templates may be determined by a set of rules. This may require finding a semantic equivalence between the user's description and the template indices for the metadatabase <ref> [CM + 90] </ref> or from features extracted from the query data pattern (for visual queries). 11 The ranking algorithm is then run by the search module to retrieve the relevant database sites.
