Abstract: In this paper we consider the class of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and present the results of an experimental study on four drawing algorithms specifically developed for DAGs. Our study is conducted on two large test suites of DAGs and yields more than 30 charts comparing the performance of the drawing algorithms with respect to several quality measures, including area, crossings, bends, and aspect ratio. The algorithms exhibit various trade-offs with respect to the quality mea sures, and none of them clearly outperforms the others.

Reference-contexts: The issue of resolution of a drawing has been extensively studied, motivated by the finite resolution of physical rendering devices. Several papers have been published about the resolution and the area of drawings of graphs; (see, e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 11, 15] </ref>). The resolution of a drawing is defined as the minimum distance between two vertices. The grid-based algorithms consider edge-bends and edge-crossings as "dummy" vertices for computing the resolution. The layering-based algorithms, however, do not consider the edge-crossings as dummy vertices for computing the resolution.

Reference-contexts: The experiments provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of the performance of the four algorithms, and show that they exhibit trade-offs between "aesthetic" properties (e.g., crossings, bends, edge length) and running time. The observed practical behavior of the algorithms is consistent with their theoretical properties. Brandenburg, Himsolt, and Rohrer <ref> [2] </ref> compare five "force-directed" algorithms for constructing straight-line drawings of general undirected graphs. The algorithms are tested on a a wide collection of examples and with different settings of the force parameters. The quality measures evaluated are crossings, edge length, vertex distribution, and running time.

Reference-contexts: Due to space limitations we could not include all the charts, which appear in a longer version of this paper [6]. 2 The Drawing Algorithms Under Evaluation We have tested four different algorithms for producing drawing of DAGs. Our main graph drawing tool has been GDW <ref> [3] </ref>, a system for prototyping and testing graph drawing algorithms. The four algorithms can be classified into two categories on the basis of their approach to constructing drawings. <p> Layers is the original algorithm by Sugiyama, Tagawa and Toda [23]. For our study we have used the implementation of Layers available in GDW <ref> [3] </ref>. Grid-Based: These algorithms accept, as input, a planar st-graph, i.e., a planar DAG with exactly one source and one sink, and construct an upward grid drawing of it. <p> We have evaluated the performance of an algorithm, called Visibility, which follows this approach, and of three variations of it, called Barycentric Visibility, Long Edge Visibility, and Median Visibility. For our study we have used the implementations of these algorithms available in GDW <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> For this reason, this algorithm is also known as the left-right algorithm. In this paper we have referred to this algorithm as Lattice. For our study we have used the implementation of Lattice available in GDW <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Experimental Setting The following quality measures of a drawing of a DAG have been considered: Area: area of the smallest rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides covering the drawing; Cross: total number of edge-crossings; TotalBends: total number of edge-bends; TotalEdgeLen: total edge length; MaxEdgeBends: maximum number of bends on

Several papers have been published about the resolution and the area of drawings of graphs; (see, e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 11, 15] </ref>). The resolution of a drawing is defined as the minimum distance between two vertices. The grid-based algorithms consider edge-bends and edge-crossings as "dummy" vertices for computing the resolution. The layering-based algorithms, however, do not consider the edge-crossings as dummy vertices for computing the resolution.

Reference-contexts: Step 3 Reduce the number of bends by readjusting the position of vertices on each layer. Because of their generality and conceptual simplicity, these algorithms are very popular among the designers of practical graph drawing systems. Several layering-based algorithms have been designed <ref> [5] </ref>. The above steps have also been investigated separately, and various heuristics have been proposed for each of them. In this paper, we have evaluated and compared the performance of two layering based algorithms: Dot and Layers. <p> ResFactor: Inverse of the minimum distance between two vertices, or two edge crossings, or an edge-crossing and a vertex. It is widely accepted (see, e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>) that small values of the above measures are related to the perceived aesthetic appeal and visual effectiveness of the drawing. The issue of resolution of a drawing has been extensively studied, motivated by the finite resolution of physical rendering devices.

Reference-contexts: This is done by introducing a fictitious vertex for each crossing between two edges. These fictitious vertices are assigned a position on the grid, but are not represented in the final drawing. The simple planarization method we have used for our study is the one described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The grid-based algorithms that we evaluated and compared fall under two categories: Visibility Representation-Based: These algorithms use a two-step process for constructing drawings [10]. <p> This indicates that the crossing reduction step of the layering-based algorithms is more effective than the simple planarization strategy <ref> [9] </ref> used in Visibility and Lattice. On the other hand, Visibility and Lattice perform well with respect to other quality measures (see Section 4).

The experiments are conducted with the graph drawing system GraphEd <ref> [17] </ref>. Many examples of drawings constructed by the algorithms are shown, and various objective and subjective evaluations on the aesthetic quality of the drawings produced are given. However, statistics are provided only on the edge length, and few details on the experimental setting are provided.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over a decade of research in the graph drawing area, motivated by applications to information visualization, has produced a wealth of drawing algorithms. Assessing the practical performance of some of these algorithms has been recently the goal of experimental comparative studies. In <ref> [18] </ref> the performance of four planar straight-line drawing algorithms is compared. The standard deviations in angle size, edge length, and face area are used to compare the quality of the planar straight-line drawings produced.

Reference-contexts: The quality measures evaluated are crossings, edge length, vertex distribution, and running time. They also identify trade-offs between the running time and the aesthetic quality of the drawings produced. Junger and Mutzel <ref> [19] </ref> investigate crossing minimization strategies for straight-line drawings of 2-layer graphs, and compare the performance of eight popular heuristics for this problem. In this paper we consider the important class of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and compare the performance of four drawing algorithms specifically developed for them.

Reference-contexts: Within our experimental setting, we have performed a comparative study of four popular drawing algorithms for DAGs: two of them are based on the layering paradigm <ref> [20, 23] </ref>, while the other two are based on the grid paradigm [10, 11]. Our comparison highlights how more than ten years of research in this field have produced a complex landscape. <p> The above steps have also been investigated separately, and various heuristics have been proposed for each of them. In this paper, we have evaluated and compared the performance of two layering based algorithms: Dot and Layers. Dot is a highly optimized algorithm, developed by Koutsofios and North <ref> [20] </ref> as a successor to Dag [13, 14]. Dot first constructs a polyline layered drawing of the input directed graph and then, as a final step, converts the polygonal chains representing the edges into smooth curves using splines. <p> They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs [21], that North collected at AT&T Bell Labs by running for two years Draw DAG, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings <ref> [20] </ref>. Originally, the North DAGs consisted of 5114 directed graphs, whose number of vertices varied in the range 1 : : : 7602.

Reference-contexts: Our setting consists of (i) two large test suites of DAGs, one obtained from the collection of directed graphs submitted to the e-mail graph drawing service at Bell Labs <ref> [21] </ref>, and the other randomly generated by a program that simulates a PERT project planner; (ii) a set of quality measures for drawings of DAGs derived from [7]. <p> We considered two typical contexts where DAGs play a fundamental role, namely software engineering and project planning. The first set of test DAGs are what we call the North DAGs. They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs <ref> [21] </ref>, that North collected at AT&T Bell Labs by running for two years Draw DAG, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings [20]. <p> However, the density of the directed graphs with a number of vertices that did not fall in the range 10 : : :100 was very low (see also the statistics in <ref> [21] </ref>); since such directed graphs represent a very sparse statistical population we decided to discard them. Then we noted that many directed graphs were isomorphic; since the vertices of the directed graphs have labels associated with them, the problem is tractable.

Our comparison highlights how more than ten years of research in this field have produced a complex landscape. <p> These algorithms accept as input directed graphs without any particular restriction (the input directed graph can be planar or not, acyclic or cyclic). For constructing drawings, they generally follow the methodology of Sugiyama et al. <ref> [23] </ref>, which consists of the following three steps: Step 1 Assign vertices to layers heuristically optimizing some criteria, such as the total edge length. Step 2 Reduce the crossings among edges by permuting the order of vertices on each layer. <p> However, since all other algorithms considered in this study represent edges as polygonal chains, we decided to analyze the polyline drawing produced by Dot and not the final drawing with curved lines. Layers is the original algorithm by Sugiyama, Tagawa and Toda <ref> [23] </ref>. For our study we have used the implementation of Layers available in GDW [3]. Grid-Based: These algorithms accept, as input, a planar st-graph, i.e., a planar DAG with exactly one source and one sink, and construct an upward grid drawing of it.

Reference-contexts: This has a dramatic impact on the quality of the drawing. Similarly, we believe that the performance of several algorithms, such as Visibility, can be improved by a postprocessing "beautification" step. For example, it would be interesting to study bend-stretching techniques <ref> [25] </ref> that reduce the bends by doing local transformations. Similarly, the role of the preprocessing step should also be studied. In particular, the performance of grid-based algorithms can be improved by using a more sophisticated planarizer.
