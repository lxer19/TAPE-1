Title: Codes for Second and Third Order GH-ARQ Schemes  
Author: Luca de Alfaro and Angelo Raffaele Meo 
Abstract: In the usual ARQ (Automatic-Repeat-Request) communication protocols, when the receiver detects the presence of errors in a received message, it requests the retransmission of another copy of the message, and the process continues until an uncorrupted copy reaches the destination. If the quality of the channel is poor, the number of retransmissions may become very large. In order to improve the efficiency at large channel error rates, some new techniques known as Type-II Hybrid ARQ Schemes have recently been proposed. In these techniques the transmitter does not retransmit the message encoded as in the first transmission: it sends instead additional redundancy that is decoded at the destination along with the previously received information to allow error correction. In this paper a new kind of Type-II Hybrid ARQ transmission scheme is proposed. The copies of the message are encoded in different ways, so that each copy has the same information content, and the knowledge of any subset of the copies allows error correction. This transmission scheme is well suited to broadcast as well as for point to point communications. We have obtained trough computer search a family of optimum and quasi-optimum codes for the proposed transmission scheme. They are described along with new decoding techniques of remarkable simplicity and effectiveness. These codes allow a message to be encoded in up to three different ways, and they are shown to be simple to encode and decode and to perform well over channels affected by error bursts.

Reference-contexts: VI. Throughput of the Cyclic GH-ARQ Schemes We have used computer simulation to evaluate the throughput of the cyclic GH-ARQ schemes and to compare it to the throughput of other schemes previously studied, e.g., by Krishna and Morgera <ref> [22] </ref>. The simulation models is based on the following simplifying assumptions: 1. The FCS used has a perfect error detection capability: it never fails to detect errors present in the message. 2. It is always possible to correctly decode the header of the messages. 3. <p> ED F1 571 59D 67C 727 7D2 12E 153 1BF 0DB 0ED 117 1B0 166 1C4 043C 0686 0833 0A9E 0DFC B : 001F 0067 00AB 00D5 012D 0433 0836 1039 0436 070A 0835 0AF7 0D82 the simple ARQ transmission scheme nor in the GH ARQ scheme, nor in scheme <ref> [22] </ref>. 5.
