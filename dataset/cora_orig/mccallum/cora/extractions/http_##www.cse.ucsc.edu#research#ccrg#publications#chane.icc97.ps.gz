Abstract: We specify and analyze two variants of floor acquisition multiple access protocols for single-channel wireless LANs (WLANs) with hidden terminals. One variant assumes that all stations have the same functionality, and the other assumes base-station control. These are the first protocols that solve the hidden-terminal problems of single-channel WLANS. Stations use carrier sensing and a three-way handshake, just as advocated in MACA, IEEE 802.11 and FAMA-NTR introduced in the past. However, the CTS from a receiver lasts long enough to be able to jam any hidden sender that did not hear the RTS being acknowledged and who started sending its RTS after the receiver started sending the CTS. We verify that this jamming of the "offending senders" by the receivers permits floor acquisition to be enforced correctly, i.e., that no data packet sent by a sender will ever collide at the intended receiver with any packet sent by any other station hidden or exposed from the sender. The performance of these protocols is compared by simulation with the performance of MACAW reported in the past.

Reference-contexts: More recently, the IEEE 802.11 [2, 5] committee proposed a MAC protocol for wireless LANs that includes a transmission mode based on an RTS-CTS handshake. In <ref> [1, 12] </ref>, the MACA protocol is augmented with additional message types and backoff and retransmission strategies aimed at improving throughput. Finally, in [4] it is shown that carrier sensing by the sender should be used in combination with MACA's basic RTS-CTS handshake to achieve better throughput. <p> We present simulations fl for both the general FAMA-NPR protocol as well as the base station specific model, FAMA-NBR. Figure 8 shows the various configurations used by the simulations. Tables 1 and 2 show the results for our two protocols compared to MACAW <ref> [1] </ref> using single packet transmissions and using packet trains, respectively. <p> In configurations (b) and (c) the rate was 32 packets per second at each transmitting node. Both FAMA protocols deliver throughput similar or better than those reported for MACAW in <ref> [1] </ref>. Additionally fairness is not an issue in FAMA. Our uniformly distributed backoff scheme gives all stations basically an equal share of the channel (although we do not include any statistical analysis, the all stations received within 10% of the average throughput). <p> We used the same traffic rates as the simulations in (a). FAMA-NPR and FAMA-NBR both achieve throughput of 72% as in the non-hidden-terminal case. (MACAW <ref> [1] </ref> did not give results for this configuration). 6 Conclusion We have described new channel access protocols, FAMA-NPR and FAMA-NBS, which are the first to ensure that data packets are sent without collisions in WLANs with hidden terminals.

Reference-contexts: When a sending station wants to transmit, it sends a request-to-send (RTS) to the receiver, who responds with a clear-to-send (CTS) if it receives the RTS correctly.

The basis for solving all hidden-terminal problems with these protocols is the following: Stations use carrier sensing and a three-way handshake, just as the basic FAMA-NTR introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the CTS from a receiver lasts long enough to be able to jam any hidden sender that did not hear the RTS being acknowledged and who started sending its RTS after the receiver started sending the CTS. <p> Second, the basic schemes used to enforce floor acquisition under hidden-terminals are easy to understand within the context of a single-channel, and can be extended to multiple channels. 2 FAMA-NPR (Non-persistent, Peer Receiver) FAMA-NPR is a variant of the FAMA-NTR protocol <ref> [4] </ref> for wireless networks in which all stations have the same functionality. It uses non-persistent carrier sensing and an RTS-CTS exchange to gain information about the state of the channel, together with waiting periods based on the channel state.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) protocols <ref> [7] </ref> have been used in many wireless networks [8]. The basis for the operation of CSMA protocols is for stations with packets to send to abstain from sending packets if they detect that other transmissions are occupying the channel. Unfortunately, CSMA protocols suffer from what is called "hidden terminal problems".
