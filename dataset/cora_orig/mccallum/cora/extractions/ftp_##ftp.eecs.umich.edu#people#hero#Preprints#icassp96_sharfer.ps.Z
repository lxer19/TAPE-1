Abstract: A Maximum Likelihood (ML) method for joint estimation of amplitude, phase, time delay, and data demodulation in a single-user direct sequence spread spectrum communication system is developed. The likelihood function is analytically intractable, so a recursive estimation algorithm is considered. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm has been used in similar problems, however, in this case it is not computationally efficient. Recently, a variant of the EM algorithm, called Space Alternating Generalized EM (SAGE), has been derived. In this work we apply the SAGE algorithm to the sequence estimation problem in a way which results in simple sequential updates of all the estimated parameters. An important feature of the proposed algorithm is the use of a discrete wavelet decomposition of the received signal as a sufficient statistic. The consequence is that all the information is still available to the receiver, while the complicated estimation problem is considerably simplified. Computer simulations of a single user system were performed. It is shown that the algorithm has fast convergence, and essentially achieves optimal performance.

Reference-contexts: The transmitted signal was then passed through a band limited AWGN channel, jf j 1=2T c , where T c is the chip time. The data bits were differentially decoded, due to phase ambiguity. The algorithm was allowed to synchronize during the first 31 bits. The Daubechies wavelets <ref> [1] </ref> of length 4 have been used in the wavelet decomposition of the received signal. the simulation results closely match the theoretical bound for a DPSK decoder. The performance of a phase coherent DLL with comparable response time is also shown.

The SAGE algorithm is more flexible than the EM algorithm, because it is possible to update subsets of the parameter, resulting in simpler updates and faster convergence.

Reference-contexts: Usually, these parameters are estimated by a combination of several techniques, each specialized to a particular parameter. For example, carrier phase and time delay estimation are mostly done with a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) and a Delay Locked Loop (DLL) respectively <ref> [4] </ref>. A considerable research activity has been directed at improving the performance of these basic synchronization techniques, e.g. by using decision feedback in a Data Aided Loop (DAL) configuration [5]. Clearly, an optimal receiver is one which jointly estimates the nuisance parameters as well as the data symbols. <p> The loop damping of the equivalent PLL was taken as = 0:707, and zero detuning was assumed. The DLL error probability was found by numerical integration <ref> [4] </ref>. We observe that the DLL performance has degraded by more than 1dB with respect to the ideal PSK error bound, while the SAGE performance is essentially optimal. Figure 2 shows the synchronization performance of the SAGE algorithm.

Clearly, an optimal receiver is one which jointly estimates the nuisance parameters as well as the data symbols. In this work we consider the problem of Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of all the parameters given the received signal. <p> The CR bound on phase error variance is shown for reference. The DAL performance was calculated with the same value of ffi as above, for the case of a suppressed carrier (m = 0, see <ref> [5] </ref>). The two systems have a similar performance, but it should be noted that the DAL relies on a perfectly synchronized reference. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have introduced a new method for joint timing and phase synchronization and optimal ML detection of transmitted symbols.

Reference-contexts: The result is a causal, fully digital receiver which makes a "single pass" on the information, without requiring any buffering or delayed processing. The principle of using a sufficient statistic in a similar problem has been discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we define the system model, and briefly review the SAGE algorithm and the concept of a hidden data space. In section 3 we develop the single user algorithm, and outline a strategy of choosing the hidden data spaces.
