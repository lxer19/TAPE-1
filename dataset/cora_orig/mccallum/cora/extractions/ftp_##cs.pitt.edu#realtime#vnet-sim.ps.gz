Abstract: This paper describes a new network architecture, called the Versatile Network Architecture (Vnet), which provides a framework for flexible support of communication requirements in real-time networks. Vnet differs from other proposed architectures in that it has been designed to support a variety of packet scheduling algorithms and traffic policing mechanisms. In addition, we use simulations to validate Vnet, providing an assessment of the correctness of the scheme in guaranteeing the real-time performance requirements of a wide range of multimedia applications and quantify and analyze the effects a variety of V-channel traffic profiles, QoS requirements, and node scheduling policies on the performance of the Vnet.

Reference-contexts: In [3], the resources are granted on basis of fairness, according to their requirements. Channels that use less than their fair share, are able to get faster service. However, this scheme provides no means to reserve resources and thus cannot issue guarantees. To solve the problem of guarantees, in <ref> [8, 2] </ref> an admission algorithm is added, as well as support for a fixed rate real-time and predictive traffic sources. These mechanisms work in unloaded networks, and not only will have high delays under higher loads but also cannot control the jitter of packets, an important aspect of multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: Since the network is always reserved for the channel it is allocated to, it will be unused when the channel is idle thus reducing the resource efficiency.

Reference-contexts: Vnet inter-queue scheduling The Vnet architecture creates a model where the feasibility of supporting the real-time requirements of a set of Vnets can be verified for different scheduling policies in a heterogeneous network environment. Liu and Layland <ref> [9] </ref> showed that, for periodic preemptive real-time activities, it is possible to determine the feasibility of an activity set just by computing the utilization of the activity set and comparing it to a schedulable bound: the rate monotonic (RM) and the earliest deadline first (EDF) priority assignments.

Reference-contexts: Simulation Model To assess the correctness of the proposed scheme and analyze its effectiveness in handling a wide spectrum of MMAs real-time requirements, a simulation model of the Vnet architecture is developed. The simulation program was written in CSIM <ref> [10] </ref> and developed on a DEC-Station 5000. CSIM is a C-based process-oriented simulation language. Process oriented simulation is a convenient tool for developing simulation models for distributed systems. The primary unit of execution is a process and all currently active processes execute in a quasi-parallel fashion. <p> Paths were randomly assigned to each V-channel request. Twenty-four best-effort traffic sources were also appended to the above channel request set.
