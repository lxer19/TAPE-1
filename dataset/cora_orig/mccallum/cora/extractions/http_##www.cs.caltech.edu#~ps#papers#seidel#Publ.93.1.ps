Abstract: A new multivariate B-spline scheme based on blending functions and control vertices has recently been developed by Dahmen, Micchelli, and Seidel [4]. This surface scheme allows to model piecewise polynomial surfaces of degree k over arbitrary triangulations, such that the resulting surfaces are C k1 -continuous everywhere. The scheme exhibits both affine invariance and the convex hull property, and the control points can be used to manipulate the shape of the surface locally. Any piecewise polynomial can be represented by the new scheme [16]. This paper illustrates some of the algorithms underlying the new scheme by means of examples from a first test implementation [6]. Keywords: Blossoming, B-patch, B-spline surface, blending functions, control points, simplex splines, polar forms.

This section describes the basic setup. 2.1 Evaluation The most important algorithm required is one which evaluates points on the surface. Although several mechanisms of evaluation are available for the new scheme <ref> [4] </ref>, evaluation in our editor is based on the recurrence relation for simplex splines. This has the advantage, that the basis functions can be evaluated on a fine grid underlying the given triangulation T once and for all. The values on this grid can then be stored.

Reference-contexts: Then, polar forms f I of the restriction of F to every 4 (I) 2 T; I 2 I, are computed using the multiaffine version of the de Casteljau algorithm <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. The B-spline control points c I fi are then obtained by evaluating f I using the above equation. Converting degree k B-spline surfaces F over arbitrary triangulations T to piecewise Bezier surfaces requires a bit more work.

The editor allows to manipulate the shape of a surface through the movement of the control vertices which make up the control net. The editor also allows surface changes to be made through movement of knots.

Reference-contexts: It is known from the theory of simplex splines that knot multiplicities along a line reduce the order of continuity along this line <ref> [10] </ref>. For example, a degree 2 surface with knots in general position is C 1 -continuous everywhere. Placing three knots on a line reduces the continuity to C 0 and placing four knots produces a discontinuity along the line.

It has been shown in <ref> [16] </ref> that any piecewise polynomial surface F over a triangulation T can be represented as a linear combination of normalized B-splines N I fi . Conversely, any B-spline can be represented as piecewise Bezier surface. <p> Conversely, any B-spline can be represented as piecewise Bezier surface.
