Abstract: This document describes the requirements for the Sc.M. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science at Brown. It begins with a one-page summary of the requirements and continues with a detailed explanation of these requirements, first for Sc.M. students and then for Ph.D. students. Should these requirements change in the future, the requirements that apply to a given student will be either those in existence at the students entry into the program of study or those as revised since that time, at Sc.M. students must satisfactorily complete eight approved courses and either a project or a thesis. Two of the courses may be reading and research courses leading to the project or thesis or courses taken in another department. Of the remaining six courses, two must be practice courses at least one of which has a substantial programming requirement, and two must be theory courses. This leaves two elective courses, which should be chosen so that the overall program provides depth in an area of specialization. The six practice, theory, and elective courses must be 100-level or 200-level courses other than reading and research courses. At least two of these courses must be 200-level courses. Ph.D. students must satisfy a set of requirements for admission to candidacy, fulfill major and minor course requirements, do a thesis proposal, complete a thesis that embodies the results of original research and gives evidence of high scholarship, and obtain 24 tuition credits. the students option.
