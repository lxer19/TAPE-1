Abstract: Stealth navigation is a fundamental capability for a scout vehicle to effectively perform reconnaissance missions. One component of stealth is the ability to plan paths that minimize visibility of the vehicle from target locations. This paper demonstrates a stealth planning system using visibility analysis on digital terrain elevation maps for path planning. Goal locations can be user specified or automatically constructed at the visibility boundary for RSTA operations. The second component of our stealth navigation system is the ability to control a vehicle to minimize exposure during RSTA operations in the presence of sensor measurement error, inaccurate terrain maps or a dynamic environment. The notion of visual stealth behavior, i.e. visual servoing to acquire and maintain a stealth position or trajectory is introduced as a mechanism for robust stealth navigation. Matching and tracking terrain features in the image space are identified as important pre-requisites for visual stealth behaviors. A method is described to track an important terrain feature in image-space namely, horizon curves.

Reference-contexts: Next we demonstrate the initial effort in the implementation of such simple behaviors by showing how matched curves can be tracked. Then we describe experiments with matching horizon curves using footprints <ref> [Kalvin86] </ref>, and tracking them over a motion sequence. 4.1 Tracking In order to track object features in the image, first a correspondence between the object features and their image space appearances must be obtained. This can be used to construct or create templates that capture the feature. <p> This value is obtained by assuming a 2 o error in the model curve projection. Then, extremely small curves (less than five pixel wide) are pruned and the remaining curves are candidates for matching. Matching is accomplished using footprints as described in <ref> [Kalvin86] </ref> and curves that obtained a raw match score beyond a threshold (indicating at least a 50% match) are depicted in Figure 4 (iii). Model curves are marked in black and the four data curves in white (the hill on the left in Figure 4 (iii) has two data curves). <p> Templates are initialized as follows; High curvature points that are represented as long lines in the 45 o or 45 o direction of the turning angle graph <ref> [Kalvin86] </ref> of the data segments are used as initialization points. In case there are no turns in the turning angle graph then the given segment has very low curvature and can be approximated as a straight line and two templates suffice. <p> We have demonstrated the use of a tracker that is based on rotation compensated normalized correlation and is amenable to real-time oper ation. We have shown an example where we have applied an algorithm <ref> [Kalvin86] </ref> to match and track horizon curves. 6 Future Work The planning algorithm provides a framework for robust trajectory generation in the presence of errors such as un-modelled obstacles. We have developed a real time stereo-based obstacle detection system that registers obstacles on a local map [Badal94].

Thus, paths can be planned in real-time, within safe regions and at both the mission and execution levels.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the approach presented by Hager, we employ polar space correlation to compensate for large instantaneous rotations. An excellent study of visual servoing can be found in [Hashimoto94], which primarily covers a manipulator, hand-eye environment. Visual servoing has been used on mobile robots in structured environments <ref> [Zhang93] </ref> and in outdoor environments [Fennema91, Dickmanns88] 3 Stealth Planning Stealth paths which avoid terrain obstacles and visible-to-target locations are planned over a region of the terrain map using harmonic functions. <p> As position errors due to odometry inaccuracies accumulate, visual servoing from distinctive landmarks can be used to reduce these errors to manageable levels <ref> [Fennema91, Zhang93] </ref>. In a stealth scenario, for example, when the ve hicle is approaching a boundary of visibility, inaccurate odometry or terrain maps might cause it to become prematurely visible to the target, violating the stealth condition.
