Abstract: We study the problem of transmitting time constrained synchronous messages in a slotted ring based local area network, carrying synchronous and asynchronous traffic. A bandwidth allocation scheme for synchronous messages is developed on top of a media access control protocol that assigns preemptive priority to synchronous traffic over asynchronous traffic. We derive sufficient conditions for schedulability of time critical synchronous messages and show that the scheme achieves high levels of schedulable utilization. A slot access protocol is proposed for synchronous streams that implements the allocation scheme with minimal additional overhead and loss of schedulable utilization. The protocol is distributed in the sense that any node can locally determine if it can use a slot, without exchanging any explicit messages with other nodes.

Reference-contexts: The naive approach of satisfying the average requirement in every cycle (i.e., by allocating the ceiling of the bandwidth required) may result in significant over-allocation. To counter this, we use an approach similar to <ref> [9] </ref> which was used for pre-run-time scheduling of hard real-time tasks in a multi-processor environment. We propose a distributed protocol to implement the allocation scheme. The distributed protocol allows each stream to determine locally, its allocation within a particular cycle. <p> The simplest way to get around this problem is to allocate dI i + F i e slots to stream S i in every cycle. This scheme may allocate significantly more slots than required and may severely hamper schedulability. We use an allocation scheme similar to that proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> to avoid over-allocation and derive a schedulability condition for the proposed allocation scheme. The idea behind the allocation algorithm is as follows. Out of M (L 1) slots available in a cycle, the integral slot requirements of all streams are satisfied first.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, since the protocol we use assigns preemptive priority to synchronous traffic, the asynchronous traffic may use any bandwidth unused by the synchronous traffic without affecting the schedulability of synchronous messages.

We propose a bandwidth allocation scheme for real-time communication of synchronous messages. The scheme divides the time frame into allocation cycles, and attempts to satisfy the average requirements of each stream in every allocation cycle. <p> We assume that there is a virtual station for each message stream.

We consider a slot allocation scheme in which the time-line is divided into fixed length intervals.

The Class field is used to check the us ability of a slot by a station.
