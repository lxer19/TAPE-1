Reference-contexts: The actual long-term historic postwar value of the M2 6 velocity of money in the United States is 1.6527 <ref> (Hallman et. a l . 1989) </ref> so that the correct solution is the multiplicative (non-linear) relationship M2 = GD* GNP82 However, we are not told a priori whether the functional relationship between the given observed data (the three independent variables) and the target function (the dependent variable M2) is linear, multiplicative,

Reference-contexts: Professor John Holland of the University of Michigan presented the pioneering formulation of genetic algorithms for fixed-length character strings in Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems <ref> (Holland 1975) </ref>. Holland established, among other things, that genetic algorithms operating on strings are a mathematically near optimal approach to adaptation when the adaptive process is viewed as a set of simultaneous multi-armed slot machine problems requiring an optimal allocation of future trials given currently available information.

Reference-contexts: Sexpressions in the LISP programming language) rather than the fixed-length character strings. Populations of LISP Sexpressions (computer programs) can be genetically bred to solve a variety of different problems in several different areas of artificial intelligence and symbolic processing <ref> (Koza 1989, Koza 1990, Koza and Keane 1990) </ref>, including (1) optimal control (e.g. finding a nonlinear function that is a time-optimal control strategy for balancing a broom), (2) sequence induction (e.g. inducing a recursive computational procedure for the Fibonacci sequence), (3) planning problems (e.g. a robotic action sequence for stacking blocks
