IMAGE VII Conf., </booktitle> <address> Tucson, AZ, </address> <month> June, </month> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: The program supplies the corresponding joint limits. Hands are included. Francisco Azuola will be enhancing SASS to support the specification of body sizes via direct anthropometric measurements (sam's), as well as joint center to center segment x-y-z measurements <ref> [1] </ref>. Supporting a set of direct body measurements will give SASS an intuitive and natural user interface. Ann Song and Susanna Wei are building X SASS: SASS running under the X-windows programming environment [29]. Picture buttons and pull-down menus enhance the user interface. <p> can be purchased from a number of commercial sources, such as Viewpoint Datalabs); the greater challenge lies in keeping them reasonable under anthropometric scaling such as accommodated in SASS. 6 5.7 Free Form Deformation: Bond- Jay Ting Bond-Jay Ting's work involves modeling the human body by using free form deformations <ref> [1] </ref>. Free form deformations were originally used as a tool to model complex objects by deforming simpler primitives [SP86]. They are also used to animate such objects. In our applications, the human torso is treated as one deformable segment. <p> system with a task-level interface. 9 Physics-Based Modeling and Analysis 9.1 Active Part-Decomposition, Shape and Motion Estimation of Articulated Objects: A Physics based Approach: Ioannis Kakadi aris Ioannis Kakadiaris has developed a novel, robust, integrated physics-based technique to reliably identify an articulated object's parts, joint locations, shape and motion parameters <ref> [16, 1] </ref>. To overcome the inde-terminancy of part-identification from a single image, a sequence of images of a moving articulated object is used instead.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the standard techniques of key-frame animations, Rama Bindiganavale and Susanna Wei use a finite state machine to control the behaviorally reasonable transitions from any posture to a goal posture by finding the shortest path of the required predetermined motion sequences between the two <ref> [2] </ref>. If the motion sequence is not collision-free, then a collision avoidance strategy is invoked and the posture is changed to one that satisfies the required goal while respecting object and agent integrity.

Reference-contexts: It also performs the ballistics computation for firing the gun into the scene, and determining where the human figures get hit. 5 5.3 Controlling a Virtual Human Us- ing Minimal Sensors: Michael Hollick and John Granieri Jack's detailed human model can be driven by external sensors in real time <ref> [3] </ref>. Using as few as 4 Ascension Technology Flock of Birds T M 6-DOF sensors we are able to create a good approximation of a human operator's posture.

Reference-contexts: We have achieved international recognition for our research and specifically the Jack R fl 1 software. Much of the Lab's work is reported in a recent book <ref> [4] </ref>. In January 1994, we became the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation (HMS), a formal University entity with a Director (Norm Badler) and an external Advisory Committee.

Reference-contexts: Because the behavioral description is posed as a network of modules with floating point communication, low-level learning and numerical optimization techniques can be applied to aid the user in developing an adequate set of parameters for the behaviors. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Becket uses gradient search and proposes to use a genetic optimization routine for finding optimal weights given a user-defined fitness function. <p> This use of optimization addresses one of primary problems with designing behavioral or reactive systems arbitration among competing behaviors to decide which gets control of the effectors rapidly becomes too complex for the agent designer. Also addressed in <ref> [5] </ref> is the sequencing of behavioral weights given to optimize total reward using a variety of unsupervised reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and classifier systems. 8 Automatic Animation 8.1 Gestures and Facial Anima tion: Justine Cassell, Catherine Pelachaud, Matthew Stone, Brett Achorn and Brett Douville This project is led by

Reference-contexts: This allows more natural movement with fewer distractions and encumbrances than existing systems. 5.4 Jack LISP-API and PaT-Nets: Welton Becket The Jack Lisp Application Programming Interface (Lisp-API) provides a consistent, well-documented, protected interface to Jack functionality for developers and users of Jack <ref> [6] </ref>. Jack-5.8 contains a version of the XLISP-STAT Common Lisp subset written by Luke Tierney of the University of Minnesota School of Statistics and David M. Betz. XLISP-STAT is time-sliced into the Jack process and allows general programming of Jack through approximately 150 access functions.

Reference-contexts: changing terrain, or unexpected events due to hostile agents or the effects of limited perception. 7.4 Behavioral Walking: Welton Becket Behavioral walking uses behavioral or "reactive planning" techniques to navigate a simulated human or group of humans through a scene in order to get to a particular location without collisions <ref> [7] </ref>. The behavioral walking relies on tight couplings of simulated 8 sensors to simulated effectors rather than on static plans based on a static environment. As a result, the behavioral walking works in real time and works effectively with moving obstacles (such as other agents), unexpected obstacles, or unexpected opportunities.

The conversation is created by a dialogue planner that produces the text as well as the intonation of the utterances. The speaker/listener relationship, the text, and the intonation in turn drive facial expressions, lip motions, eye gaze, head motion, and arm gesture generators.

Reference-contexts: To overcome the inde-terminancy of part-identification from a single image, a sequence of images of a moving articulated object is used instead. Initially, the program assumes that 9 the object consists of a single part, and fits a de--formable model to the given data using our physics-based framework <ref> [22, 23] </ref>. As the object attains new postures, decision criteria determine if and when to replace the initial model with two new models. These criteria are based on the model's state and the given data. <p> The result would be a shape that has a hole which can appear depending on the blending parameters. These shapes are incorporated into a physics-based Lagrangian dynamics framework which uses globally and locally deformable models <ref> [22] </ref>. We can also perform shape morphing, by changing the parameters of an object over time. Since blended shapes have good shape coverage, it is possible to morph between a variety of interesting shapes, including shapes of differing genus. <p> This can be useful for detecting situations where independent physiological systems become dependent because they are physically adjacent to one another. Kaye represents anatomical parts accurately using a method that combines superquadric and finite element modeling <ref> [22] </ref>. He models the significant physiological systems with qualitative models of behavior. There are five main thrusts to this project: 1. Scaling deformable models of various major organs in the chest or abdominal cavity, where the scaling represents normal, diseased, or hypertro phied situations. 2.

Reference-contexts: Free form deformations were originally used as a tool to model complex objects by deforming simpler primitives <ref> [SP86] </ref>. They are also used to animate such objects. In our applications, the human torso is treated as one deformable segment. The deformation for the human spine is controlled by an attached free form deformation lattice.

Reference-contexts: Recently, he has developed a gathering and shooting overrelaxation radiosity method <ref> [33] </ref>. In his algorithm, the conventional progressive refinement method is modified to make optimal use of the visibility information computed in each iteration: the light energy is first gathered from all visible patches and then immediately reshot to the environment together with the previously accumulated unshot light energy.

Reference-contexts: We are currently extending our approach by combining it with Jianmin Zhao's thesis work on articulated motion reconstruction <ref> [34] </ref>. The goal is to achieve complete three-dimensional shape and motion estimation of articulated figures based on multiple image sequences from a single camera. 9.2 Modeling Fluids: Nick Foster Nick Foster is using direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations to animate liquids with free surfaces.
