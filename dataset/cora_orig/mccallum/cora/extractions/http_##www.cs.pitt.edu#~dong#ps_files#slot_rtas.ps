Abstract: In this paper we present a time slot allocation scheme to support real-time communications with strict rate requirements and flexible distance constraints. We first devise an algorithm to schedule message streams on a single link. We then extend it to schedule real-time traffic on WDM optical star couplers, where the validation requirements of the device configuration are also taken into consideration in the scheduling algorithm. The results show that by decoupling the rate and distance constraint requirements of the real-time streams, high schedulability can be achieved with a relatively small jitter.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, (M) 1 guarantees that there exists at least one value of N that satisfies condition (1). It is quite possible, however, that the value of LCM is very large and there is a smaller N which also satisfies (1). A fixed point scheme <ref> [7, 1] </ref> can be used to iteratively find the minimum N that satisfies (1). Specifically, starting from an initial estimate N 0 , we can find successive 2 estimates for N from N k+1 = i=0 N k e (2) The initial estimate N 0 can be set to n. <p> The iteration will stop at the first point where N k+1 = N k , which makes the total utilization of the link equal to 1.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out in [5], the scheduling algorithms for the periodic model, EDF or RMS, are not applicable to the distance constraint model. The distance constraint scheduling problem is closely related to the pinwheel problem which is formally defined as follows <ref> [2, 6] </ref>: Given a multi-set of n positive integers A = fa 1 ; :::; a n g (a 1 ::: a n ), the problem is to find an infinite sequence (schedule) of symbols from f1,..,ng such that there is at least one symbol i within any interval of a <p> In <ref> [2, 6] </ref>, the density of A is defined as (A) = i=0 a i and several schedules are devised for the pinwheel problem. <p> In [2, 6], the density of A is defined as (A) = i=0 a i and several schedules are devised for the pinwheel problem. To guarantee a feasible schedule for a pinwheel problem, the schedulability condition derived in <ref> [6, 2] </ref> is (A) max , where max is equal to 1/2, 13/20, 2/3, 0.696, or 0.7 depending on a specific specialization operation whose objective is to transform A into another set A = f a 1 ; :::; a n g such that a i a i &lt; 2 a <p> The figure shows the improvement obtained by Tpl Sched when RSJ is increased. When 0:7, the algorithm for the pinwheel problem is guaranteed to generate a feasible schedule <ref> [2] </ref>. However, when the total density factor increases, the pinwheel algorithm fails to have a high success rate, while the Tpl Sched algorithm can achieve a high success rate by slightly relaxing the distance constraint requirement.

Reference-contexts: We modified the fixed point method to calculate the minimum template size for multiple channels <ref> [3] </ref>. Then we adapted the algorithm for the single link to the star coupler situation by following the same philosophy of earliest deadline first and the same policies of relaxing and negotiating the distance constraint. <p> Since we need to schedule the messages on W wavelength channels, the algorithm is changed to choose the first W streams without any input or output conflict to fit into a slot <ref> [3] </ref>. An algorithm named Binary Splitting was presented in [9] for scheduling passive star couplers. This is a time slot allocation scheme for time-constraint communications based on the specialization result of the pinwheel problem.

Reference-contexts: This scheme can also be applied to scheduling the backbone bus on a broadcast network such as an Ethernet or a DQDB network <ref> [4] </ref>. Assume that there exists a message set M of n isochronous message streams , M 1 , ..., M n , to be sent along a link. Time is divided into time slots, where each slot is long enough for the transmission of one message frame.

Reference-contexts: In some real-time systems, periodic tasks or messages must satisfy a timing constraint requirement relative to the finishing time of the previous instance, which is defined in <ref> [5] </ref> as the distance constraint system model. For example, along a network link of bandwidth B, an isochronous video stream may require to transmit data at a rate of R fi B, where R is specified as a proportion of the total link bandwidth. <p> But in order to maintain the human perception condition of the video, the time interval between any two consecutive video frames must not exceed some maximum value, say, D time slots, which is taken as the distance constraint requirement of the message stream. As pointed out in <ref> [5] </ref>, the scheduling algorithms for the periodic model, EDF or RMS, are not applicable to the distance constraint model.

Reference-contexts: Total Density 4 Algorithm for WDMA Passive Star coupler In order to further evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we adapt the algorithm presented in the previous section to scheduling passive star couplers in WDMA optical networks and compare its results with those of an algorithm given in <ref> [9] </ref> for solving the same problem when D i = A i . In a wavelength division multiple access (WDMA) network, an optical wavelength represents a transmission channel, and multiple channels can be multiplexed onto a single fiber. Stations may transmit/receive packets on different channels using a tunable laser transmitter/detector. <p> Since we need to schedule the messages on W wavelength channels, the algorithm is changed to choose the first W streams without any input or output conflict to fit into a slot [3]. An algorithm named Binary Splitting was presented in <ref> [9] </ref> for scheduling passive star couplers.

The four curves correspond to the success rate of four groups of random inputs, each generated based on the specified utilization range for every destination station.
