Abstract: Automated recognition of features from CAD models has been attempted for a wide range of application domains. In this paper we address the problem of representing and recognizing a complete class of features in alternative interpretations for a given design. We present a methodology for recognizing a class of machinable features and addressing the computational problems posed by the existence of feature-based alternatives. Our approach addresses a class of volumetric features that describe material removal volumes made by operations on 3-axis vertical machining centers including: drilling, pocket-milling, slot-milling, face-milling, chamfering, filleting, and blended surfaces. This approach recognizes intersecting features and is complete over all features in our class; i.e., for any given part, the algorithm produces a set containing all features in our class that correspond to possible operations for machining that part. This property is of particular significance in applications where consideration of different manufacturing alternatives is crucial.

For additional details, readers are refered to <ref> [37] </ref>. 4.1 Constructing Drilling Features. Drilling features are perhaps the most straightforward to recognize. An instance of a drilling feature can be found from any subface of a conical end surface or the cylindrical side face. <p> It would require mathematically rigorous definitions of features and the feature recognition problem, and a proof that for every instance of the problem, the algorithm halts and returns the correct answer.

Reference-contexts: The OOFF system of Vandenbrande [44] produces some alternative feature interpretations. However, the generation of alternatives is not well controlled nor is the class of alternatives produced by OOFF specified. In recent work by Sakurai <ref> [41] </ref>, the volume to be machined is decomposed into cells. Exhaustively, each combination of cells is then matched against user-defined feature templates. While the method is capable of generating all alternative feature interpretations composed of the primitive cells, it does so at a large combinatorial cost. <p> The feature algebra of Karinthi [20], starting from a single initial feature interpretation, exhaustively generates alternative interpretations of the part by manipulating the features with algebraic operators, but does not include a methodology for recognizing the features. Sakurai <ref> [41] </ref> presents a system that decomposes the volume to be machined into disjoint cells and then recombines the cells to form compound feature instances. Both of these methods are prone to combinatorial obstacles, are limited to polyhedral models, and address only rudimentary machining features and machining constraints.

Reference-contexts: De Floriani [7] employed graph-based algorithms for finding bi-connected and tri-connected components to partition a polyhedral part into several varieties of protrusion and depression features. Joshi's [19] approach used subgraph isomorphism algorithms to match feature patterns to patterns in the topology of polyhedral parts. Sakurai <ref> [42] </ref> developed a graph-based system capable of handling limited types of user-defined features, providing for a degree of application-specific customizability. In many of these approaches, the graph-based representation schemes have proven difficult to extend to the more complex surfaces and features found in realistic manufacturing problems.

Reference-contexts: The most comprehensive approach to date for recognizing features and handling their interactions has been the OOFF system (Object-Oriented Feature Finder) of Vandenbrande <ref> [44] </ref>. Vanden-brande's work, using a knowledge-based approach like Dong's, provides a framework for recognizing a significant class of realistic machining features of interest for process planning via artificial intelligence techniques in combination with queries to a solid modeler. <p> Karinthi [20] completed the first systematic work on the generation of alternative interpretations of the same object as different collections of volumetric features. They present an algebra for computing alternate interpretations of parts resulting from algebraic operations on the features. The OOFF system of Vandenbrande <ref> [44] </ref> produces some alternative feature interpretations. However, the generation of alternatives is not well controlled nor is the class of alternatives produced by OOFF specified. In recent work by Sakurai [41], the volume to be machined is decomposed into cells.
