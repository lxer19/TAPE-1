Abstract: This paper presents the developed practical approach to reactive motion control for the omnidirectional mobile vehicle of the Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot (KAMRO). The reactive control is based on the ultrasonic sensory information processing and is a supplement to the usual motion control of the vehicle. The geometrical path planner on the base of the environmental model generates global subgoals which define the coarse global path to a goal. To realize the planned motion within an environment where unknown obstacles may occur, the reactive control operates with the introduced preference functions of the vehicle and its global subgoal. The preference functions combined with the processing of sensory information provide the computation of the local subgoals leading the vehicle to its global subgoals or providing an obstacle avoidance. The developed approach is discussed and illustrated by the obtained experimental results. Key Words: reactive control, mobile robots, obstacle Real-time reactive behaviour is a substantially necessary feature of mobile robots. This provides their autonomous operation within an environment which may be dynamically changed from initial conditions described in an environmental model [1-3]. In the recent years, various research groups have been developing methods of reactive control for mobile robots. Mainly, these methods may be divided into two groups in dependence of whether they operate within a fully known environment or in the case of a partially known (or totally unknown) environment [3-5]. In the latter case the mobile vehicle does not posses enough information from its environmental model to generate a path to a goal without collisions with obstacles which are not included in the model. To avoid collisions, the sensory information about the environment is gathered and processed. Various vision systems were developed and are being studied to solve this task [6]. Such methods require significant computations and are complex for an online implementation. For practical realizations of reactive control ultrasonic sensor systems are mostly used [7, 8]. The ultrasonic sensor information is processed in different ways to obtain, e.g. a grid representation of the free space [7]. Then, the potential field method [9] or its modifications [10-13] are applied to compute a free path. The approaches within the frameworks of the potential field method have two main problems - undesired local minima and the necessity to generate arbitrarily large repulsive potential at boundaries of obstacles to avoid collisions. To solve both problems, the navigation functions were considered [10]. The wave propagation technique [14], diffusion method [15], distance field algorithm [16, 17] or probability approach [18] are used for navigation of the mobile robots. Navigation of mobile robots is carried out with the use of an environmental map [19] or without creation of such a map [4]. Architectural concepts regarding the integration of a high-level motion planning with low-level reactive behaviours [22] allow to improve the robustness and capabilities of autonomous mobile robots. The reactive behaviours provide a reasonable means to develop a reactive motion control for mobile robots. In our paper the reactive motion control along a preplanned coarse global path is considered. The global path is computed offline on the base of the environmental model. The reactive control operates with the ultrasonic sensory information and provides the collision-free motion of the vehicle in a partially known environment. avoidance.
