Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Nexus is a runtime library designed primarily as a compiler target for langages supporting task-parallel and mixed data- and task-parallel execution. The Nexus interface and Nexus design are described elsewhere <ref> [1, 2] </ref>; here, we provide the information needed to execute programs that use Nexus services. First, we introduce a few basic terms and concepts which are used in this document.
