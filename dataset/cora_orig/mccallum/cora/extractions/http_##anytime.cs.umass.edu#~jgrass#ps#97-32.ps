Reference-contexts: Preliminary evaluation shows that when operating under resource constraints (related to cost of information access and limited amount of time), our information gathering strategy leads to significant performance improvements. Although much work has been done on information gathering <ref> [1, 3, 9] </ref> and decision making [6, 7, 4] separately, little work has capitalized on the synergy that can develop when these two problems are solved together [8, 11, 13].

Reference-contexts: A continued growth in information services is expected over the coming years. In addition, improved information retrieval (IR) and information extraction (IE) technologies are becoming available <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. These technologies allow a system not only to locate but also to extract necessary information from unstructured documents.

Reference-contexts: We will relax this assumption by incorporating evidence nodes using the Noisy-OR operation in future versions of the system.) It is well known that the value of information is, in general, non-additive <ref> [5] </ref>. In other words, the value of information of a set of features is not necessarily the sum of the value of each feature.
