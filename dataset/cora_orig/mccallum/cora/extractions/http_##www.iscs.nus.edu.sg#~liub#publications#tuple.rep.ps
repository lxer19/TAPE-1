Abstract: One of the important issues in data mining is the interestingness problem. Past research and applications have shown that in many situations a huge number of patterns can be discovered from a database. Most of these patterns are actually useless or uninteresting to the user. But because of the huge number of patterns, it is difficult for the user to identify those interesting to him/her. In this project, we propose a new technique to help the user identify interesting patterns. The user is first asked to provide his/her expected patterns according to his/her past knowledge and/or intuitive feelings. Given these expectations, the system uses a tuple-level fuzzy matching technique to analyze and rank the discovered patterns according to a number of interestingness measures. With this technique, the user can quickly focus on a subset of the discovered patterns with the most application values.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these rules patterns are not useful or interesting to the user. Because of the huge number of patterns, it is very difficult for the user to analyze and to identify those that are interesting to him/her. This is known as the " interestingness" problem <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. To prevent the user from being overwhelmed 2 by a large number of patterns, techniques are needed to help the user identify the interesting ones. This is a real world problem that is faced by our industrial partner. <p> In view of this, our industrial partner approached us to study this problem. The interestingness issue has been an important problem ever since the beginning of data mining research <ref> [1] </ref>. Many factors that contribute to the interestingness of a discovered pattern have been proposed [e.g., 1, 6, 7]. They include: coverage, confidence, strength, statistical significance, simplicity, unexpectedness, and actionability [7, 10]. The first five factors are the socalled objective factors [7, 10]. <p> In view of this, our industrial partner approached us to study this problem.

Problem Definition and Scope of this Work From a users point of view, he/she wants to find interesting patterns from one or more databases D. <p> To simplify the users task of specifying the shape of this continuous function, we assume that the function has a curve of the form shown in Figure 1. Thus, the user merely needs to provide the values for a, b, c, and d. Assume the domain of Age is <ref> [1, 80] </ref>. <p> Since the users rule E j is regarded as a fuzzy rule, matching E j with each tuple in the database is also fuzzy, and it returns a value in the range <ref> [0, 1] </ref>. Thus, to consider a match to be satisfactory, a positive cutoff value needs to be used. Let positive_cutoff be a value in the range [0, 1] representing the minimal degree of match between the database tuple D k j E on either the conditional or conclusion part to be <p> as a fuzzy rule, matching E j with each tuple in the database is also fuzzy, and it returns a value in the range <ref> [0, 1] </ref>. Thus, to consider a match to be satisfactory, a positive cutoff value needs to be used. Let positive_cutoff be a value in the range [0, 1] representing the minimal degree of match between the database tuple D k j E on either the conditional or conclusion part to be considered satisfactory. The value of positive_cutoff can be specified by the user. <p> Related Work Subjective interestingness has long been identified as an important problem in data mining <ref> [1, 8, 7, 10, 6] </ref>. However, most data mining techniques and tools only deal with objective interestingness. It has been noted in [7, 8] that objective measures are insufficient for determining the interestingness of the discovered patterns. Subjective measures are needed. <p> However, most data mining techniques and tools only deal with objective interestingness.

Reference-contexts: In this research, we propose a general approach to help the user identify unexpected patterns. This approach is based on the conformity of the discovered patterns to a set of userspecified expected patterns. This conformity can be measured at the pattern-level and at the tuple-level. In <ref> [4] </ref>, we proposed a pattern-level fuzzy matching technique to help the user identify interesting patterns. In this paper, we propose a tuple-level fuzzy matching technique. <p> The pattern-level match method in <ref> [4] </ref> will give a high conforming match value. <p> We then define M cond k j, = A A j | | to be the degree of condition match of D k j concl k j, = V to be the degree of conclusion match. The detailed computation of V a,k,j k,j is discussed in <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. <p> Our proposed approach has been implemented and tested. In addition, our approach allows the user to specify his/her beliefs (or expectations) in fuzzy terms which we feel are more natural and intuitive than the complex probabilities that the user has to supply in [10]. In <ref> [4] </ref>, we proposed a method for finding unexpected patterns based on a pattern-level match technique. This method matches the discovered patterns against the user-expected patterns without consulting the database.

Thus, the main computation is at Step 2. For more detailed analysis of time and space complexities, see <ref> [5] </ref>. 4. An Illustration We have tested the system using a number of real databases from our industrial partner. Unfortunately, we are not allowed to use them here. Here, we give a test example using the credit screening database created by Chiharu Sano in UCI repository for machine learning.

Reference-contexts: Although our technique is general, its algorithms and formulae still depend on the type of patterns. It is well-known that many types of pattern may be discovered from databases. In this paper, we deal with only one type, i.e., classification patterns or rules such as those generated by C4.5 <ref> [9] </ref> or other induction systems. If other types of patterns are used, our technique needs to be customized for these pattern types.

Reference-contexts: These user rules are regarded as fuzzy rules because peoples knowledge is normally fuzzy. These fuzzy rules are described with the help of fuzzy linguistic variables and fuzzy sets <ref> [11] </ref>. See below. Note that the user does not have to give a complete set of expected rules at the beginning, which is difficult. He/she may try something simple at the beginning and incrementally build up the set of expected rules. Step 2. <p> These expected rules need to be described with the help of fuzzy linguistic variables. Let us now briefly review the definition of a fuzzy linguistic variable <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> may define that poor grade means: -(A, 0), (B, 0), (C, 0.2), (D, 0.8) (F, 1) - where the left coordinate is an element in the universe of Grade, and the right coordinate is the degree of membership of that element in the fuzzy set poor (denoted as m poor <ref> [11] </ref>), e.g., poor (D) = 0.8. reject can be described similarly. On the other hand, Age is a continuous variable. The semantic rule for old takes on the form of a continuous function.
