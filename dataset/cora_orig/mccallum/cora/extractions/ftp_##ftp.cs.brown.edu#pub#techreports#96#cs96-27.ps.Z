Reference-contexts: Let v j (r) and s j (r) respectively denote volume and surface of a j-dimensional ball of radius r. We recall that <ref> [Ber87, 9.12.4.6] </ref> v i (r) = i i r i for i even v i (r) = 2 i 2 ( i1 i! The probability density p (a 1 )da 1 = P rob (a 1 jOp 1 j a 1 + da 1 ) is obviously given by s ffi

Reference-contexts: particular, it has been observed that while some degree of approximation may be tolerated in geometric constructions, the evaluation of predicates ( the "tests " carried out in the execution of programs, such as which-side, incircle, insphere -) must be exact to ensure the structural (topological) correctness of the results <ref> [BMS94, Yap96, LPT96] </ref>. In principle, error-free predicate evaluation is achievable for error-free input operands, if the latter are treated as integers and the arithmetic is carried out with whatever operand length is required to express the intermediate results.

Reference-contexts: In recent years this issue has been amply debated in the literature (see, e.g., <ref> [BKM + 95, FV93, Yap96] </ref>). <p> In general, E is an approximate evaluator of , so that its use involves the adoption of a device, called a certifier, intended to validate the correctness of the evaluation. The pair (evaluator, certifier) is what has been refered to as a filter in the literature <ref> [FV93, MN94] </ref>. Typically, the certifier for E compares j (E )j with a fixed threshold "(E) 0. If j (E )j "(E), then the sign of (E) is reliable. Otherwise, the certifier is unable to validate the result and we have a failure of the filter.
