Title: On Automated Contracting in Multi-enterprise Manufacturing

Abstract: So far, most distributed scheduling systems have been designed for cooperative agents, and are inappropriate for self-interested agents, which exist for example in inter-firm interactions such as virtual enterprises. This paper discusses issues that arise in extending the Contract Net Protocol to operate among such self-interested agents whose rationality is bounded by combinatorial complexity. The new protocol allows varying the stage of commitment for flexibility in the contracting process. It also allows varying levels of commitment; associated advantages are reviewed. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are discussed. Tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. The Vickrey auction mechanism for truth-promotion and counter-speculation reduction is shown insufficient for bounded rational agents. Finally, a negotiation termination mechanism is discussed that guarantees finding a local optimum in distributed iterative task allocation among certain agent types.

Reference-contexts: For example, while the setting between companies is self-interested, the cell-wise distribution within each company is simultaneously cooperative. Up to date, automated distributed production planning and scheduling systems have been almost exclusively developed to operate among cooperative agents <ref> [18, 7, 1, 16] </ref>. Some reasons for distributing such systems have been presented. First there is the bandwidth argument: information is mostly sustained at the local level and this saves communication costs.

Reference-contexts: As to other forms of untruthful behavior, an agent can lie about the cost that it is willing to pay to another agent for taking care of some of its tasks, or about the cost that it requires in order to accept some of the other agents' tasks. Ephrati <ref> [2] </ref> presented an initial approach to solving the problem of exaggerating agents using the Clarke tax voting mechanism in a meeting scheduling domain. <p> Each agent's contracting decisions are based solely on these marginal cost estimates. The monetary payment mechanism allows quantitative tradeoffs between alternatives in an agent's negotiation strategy. Within DAI, bounded rationality (approximate processing) has been studied with cooperative agents, but among SI agents, perfect rationality has been widely assumed, e.g. <ref> [9, 2] </ref>. We argue that in most real multiagent applications, resource-bounded computation will be an issue, and that bounded rationality has profound implications on both negotiation protocols and strategies, see e.g. [13]. <p> whose information is biased is likely to take the associated loss while the agent with unbiased information is not. 3 Implications of bounded rationality Interactions of self-interested agents have been widely studied in game theory and other fields of microeconomics (e.g. [5, 20, 8]), and lately also within DAI (e.g. <ref> [9, 2] </ref>). Most of the results assume perfect rationality of the agents: flawless deduction, optimal reasoning about future contingencies and recursive modeling of other agents. In terms of negotiation, perfect rationality implies that agents can compute their marginal costs for tasks exactly, immediately, and without computation costs.

Reference-contexts: Because synergy savings from joint problem solving are often available among scheduling agents and virtual enterprises are becoming a reality, and because self-interested agents are inherently distributed, support mechanisms for distributed planning and scheduling among self-interested agents are clearly called for. The developing inter-enterprise communication infrastructure (EDI, NII, KQML <ref> [3] </ref>, Telescript [4] etc.) provides part of the appropriate technology push for distributed planning and scheduling applications. Such automated systems have to take into account the issues that arise from self-interest: an agent will take action only for a payment, and an agent may lie.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, they do not necessarily pass information truthfully| such an agent lies whenever it benefits from doing so. An agent may reveal only some of its tasks or resources or it might untruthfully reveal tasks or resources that do not exist. Rosenschein and Zlotkin <ref> [9] </ref> have formally analyzed the issue of task revelation. Unfortunately their analysis does not apply to most scheduling domains because it assumes that each agent has sufficient resources to potentially handle all of the tasks of all agents, and that the agents have symmetric costs for handling tasks. <p> Each agent's contracting decisions are based solely on these marginal cost estimates. The monetary payment mechanism allows quantitative tradeoffs between alternatives in an agent's negotiation strategy.

Reference-contexts: The original contract net protocol (CNP) [17] did not explicitly deal with issues arising from self-interest and bounded rationality. A first step towards extending the CNP to deal with these issues was the work on TRACONET <ref> [10] </ref>. It provided a formal model for bounded rational (BR) self-interested agents to make asynchronously announcing, bidding and awarding decisions. It used a simple static approximation scheme for marginal cost 2 calculation to make these decisions. Each agent's contracting decisions are based solely on these marginal cost estimates. <p> The design of truth-promoting, counterspeculation-free protocols for BR agents is a virgin area of research. Most probably, protocols themselves will actively use timing to minimize counterspeculation and bid biasing. 5 Terminating the negotiations Knowing when to terminate distributed search is difficult|especially for iterative refinement algorithms <ref> [10] </ref> that are not based on a systematic and often slow backtrack ing scheme. TRACONET used the following termination heuristic for distributed it-erative refinement: an agent stops negotiating once it has made no contracts during a certain fixed number of negotiation iterations. <p> Many other issues arise in contracting among BRSI agents, but where omitted due to space limitations. For example, the protocol should facilitate mechanisms to avoid local optima: task clustering <ref> [15, 10] </ref>, barter task exchanges [15], and contracts in-volving more than two agents [15]. Another issue is that sometimes the exchanges can be carried out without external enforcement [14]. There are also questions regarding message passing.

If the other party accepts, both parties are bound to the contract. <p> So, the choice of a protocol was based on characteristics of the environment. Alternatively, the choice can be made for each negotiation separately before that negotiation begins. We advocate a more refined protocol <ref> [15] </ref>, where agents dynamically choose the stage of commitment of a certain negotiation during that negotiation.

In order to bias its current negotiation decision towards accepting tasks that are synergic with anticipated future tasks, it is sufficient for the agent to take these future events into account in marginal cost estimation: this will cause the agent to anticipate with its negotiation decisions. <p> Many other issues arise in contracting among BRSI agents, but where omitted due to space limitations.
