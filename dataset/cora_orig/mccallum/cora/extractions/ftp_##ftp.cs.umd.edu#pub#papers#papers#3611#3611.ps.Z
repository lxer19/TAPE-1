Abstract: Several schemes for linear mapping of multidimensional space have been proposed for many applications such as access methods for spatio-temporal databases, image compression and so on. In all these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space is preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering [1, 13]. In this paper we provide closed-form formulas of the number of clusters required by a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra) for Hilbert space-filling curve. Both the asymptotic solution for a general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize the previous work [13], and they agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hyper-surface area of the query region and not on its hyper-volume. We have also shown that Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z-curve [21]. From the practical point of view, the formulas given in this paper provide a simple measure which can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and hence the total access time.

Reference-contexts: A good clustering of pixels will result in fewer long runs of similar pixel values, thus improving the compression ratio. 3. In geographic information systems (GIS), run-encoded forms of image representations are ordering sensitive as they are based on representations of the image as sets of runs <ref> [1] </ref>. 4. Heuristics in computational geometry problems use the mapping. For example, for the travelling salesman problem, the cities are linearly ordered and visited accordingly [2]. 5. Locality-preserving mappings are used for bandwidth reduction of digitally sampled signals [3] and for graphics display generation [18]. 6. <p> Peano, in 1890, discovered the existence of a continuous curve which passes through every point of a closed square [19]. According to Jordan's precise notion (in 1887) of continuous curves, Peano's curve is a continuous mapping of the closed unit interval I = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into the closed unit square S = [0; 1] 2 . Curves of this type have come to be called Peano curves or space-filling curves [26]. <p> According to Jordan's precise notion (in 1887) of continuous curves, Peano's curve is a continuous mapping of the closed unit interval I = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into the closed unit square S = [0; 1] 2 . Curves of this type have come to be called Peano curves or space-filling curves [26]. <p> Jagadish [12] derived closed form expressions of the average number of clusters for the Hilbert curve in a 2-dimensional grid using 2fi2 and 3fi3 square regions only. This is a special case of the more general formulae derived in this paper. Abel and Mark <ref> [1] </ref> reported empirical studies to explore the relative properties of such mapping functions using various metrics. They reached a conclusion that Hilbert ordering deserves closer attention as an alternative to z-curve ordering. Closely related analysis for the average number of d-dimensional quadtree nodes has been presented in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Generation of a 3-dimensional Hilbert curve was described in [13, 24].

In a d-dimensional space, H d k is derived from H d 1 by replacing each vertex in H d 1 by H d k1 , which may be rotated about a coordinate axis and/or reflected about a hyperplane perpendicular to a coordinate axis. <p> We call them i + neighbor and i neighbor of y, respectively. Butz showed in <ref> [4] </ref> that any unit increment in Hilbert order produces a unit increment in one of d coordinates and leaves the other d1 coordinates unchanged.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the applications described above, several other applications also benefit from the mapping which preserves locality: 1. In traditional databases, a multi-attribute space must be mapped into a one-dimensional space to allow efficient handling of partial-match queries [20]; in numerical analysis, large multidimensional arrays <ref> [5] </ref> have to be stored on disk, which is a linear structure. 2. In image compression, a family of methods use the mapping to transform the image into a bit string; subsequently, any standard compression method can be applied [16].

If the interval I can be mapped continuously onto the square S, then after partitioning I into four congruent subintervals and S into four congruent subsquares, each subinterval can be mapped continuously onto one of the subsquares. <p> To show the uniform distribution, it is important to understand * how the k-th order approximation of Hilbert curve is derived from lower order approximations, and * how the d-dimensional Hilbert curve is extended from the 2-dimensional Hilbert curve, which was described only in geometric form in <ref> [11] </ref>. Analytic forms for d-dimensional Hilbert curve were presented in [4].

Reference-contexts: In the mathematical context, these three mapping functions are based on different space-filling curves: z-curve, Gray code with bit-interleaving and Hilbert curve, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates linear orderings yielded by the space-filling curves for 4fi4 grids. In <ref> [13] </ref> we have studied the mapping functions from multidimensional space to one-dimensional space, and showed that under most circumstances the mapping based on Hilbert space-filling curve outperforms the others. <p> This measure is used only to render the analysis tractable, and some weaknesses of this measure were discussed in <ref> [13] </ref>. (a) (b) Definition 1.1 Given a d-dimensional query, a cluster is defined to be a group of grid points that are consecutively connected by a mapping (or a curve) inside a subspace represented by the query. <p> Generation of a 3-dimensional Hilbert curve was described in <ref> [13, 24] </ref>. A generalization of Hilbert curves, in an analytic form, for higher dimensional space was given in [4]. In this paper, d-dimensional Euclidean space with finite granularity is of our interest. <p> In <ref> [13] </ref>, we have compared clustering properties of several space mapping functions by considering only 2fi2 range queries. Among z-curve (2.625), Gray coding (2.5) and Hilbert curve (2), Hilbert curve was the best in minimizing the number of clusters. <p> The numbers within the parentheses are the average number of clusters for 2fi2 range queries. Rong and Faloutsos [21] derived a closed form expression of the average number of clusters for the z-curve, which gives 2.625 for 2 fi2 range queries (exactly the same with the result given in <ref> [13] </ref>) and in general approaches one third of the perimeter of the query rectangle plus two thirds of the side length of the rectangle in the unfavored direction. <p> For a square of side length 2, Corollary 1 (ii) provides 2 as an average number of clusters, which is exactly the same with the result given in <ref> [13] </ref>. 4 Exact Analysis : A special case In this section, we give a closed-form exact formula for the average number of clusters in 2-dimensional space. Specifically, we assume that grid space is mapped by H 2 k+n and query regions are square of size 2 k fi2 k . <p> The main contributions of this paper are: * Our result presented in Theorem 2 generalizes the previous work done only for 2fi2 query regions <ref> [13] </ref> by providing an exact closed-form formula for 2 k fi2 k for any k (k 1). * The asymptotic solution given in Theorem 1 further generalizes it for d-dimensional polyhedral query regions. * We have shown that, in a 2-dimensional space, the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z-curve;

Reference-contexts: An interesting application of the ordering arises in a multidimensional indexing technique proposed by Orenstein <ref> [17] </ref>.
