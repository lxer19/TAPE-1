Abstract: Let A be a n fi m matrix over an integral domain R. We will assume that the leading principal minors of A are nonzero. This assumption is not necessary, but simplifies the discussion by eliminating the issue of pivoting. First we offer a recursive description of Bareiss' standard fraction free Gaussian elimination [Bar68].

Reference-contexts: In this case the advantage of working with lower order minors (as SFF does when it can) is even greater. 3 Experiments To check the speedup in practice, the sparse fraction free Gaussian elimination (SFF) and Bareiss' fraction free Gaussian elimination (FF) were implemented in SAC2, <ref> [Col80] </ref>, and run on a Sequent Symmetry. The optimization detail discussed in the appendix was included in the implementation of SFF used for these measurements. Although the Symmetry had 8 processors to support multiprocessing, these measurements are sequential, using only one 5 processor.

Reference-contexts: It is reasonable to restrict our attention to the cost of the multiplications. For this analysis, we will assume the entries conform to the "dense" model of Gentleman and Johnson, <ref> [GJ76] </ref>. See also [HS75]. In this model, the cost of multiplication and division of entries of measure d and e is O (de).
