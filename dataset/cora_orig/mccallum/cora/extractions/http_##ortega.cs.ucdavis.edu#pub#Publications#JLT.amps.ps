Abstract: Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) provides the ability to utilize the enormous bandwidth offered by optical networks, using today's electronics. WDM-based optical networks employing passive-star couplers have been proposed for deployment in local and metropolitan areas. Optical amplification is often required in such networks to compensate for the signal attenuation along the fiber links and the splitting and coupling losses in the network. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem. A simplifying assumption for analytical tractability requires that all wavelengths, present at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level viz. the equally-powered-wavelengths case. However, previous studies did not minimize the total number of amplifiers while achieving power equalization. In this paper, we formulate the minimization of amplifiers with power equalization as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved by a linear program solver. Illustrative examples on sample networks are presented, which demonstrate the characteristics and the advantages of our optimal amplifier placement algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Several architectures have been proposed for broadband optical local/metropolitan area networks and access networks <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is used in such networks to support high-bandwidth applications. In this study, we focus on a class of such networks, which enables stations to broadcast along a dedicated wavelength (lightpath) to all other stations in the network. <p> The value of p sen can also be changed iteratively, after the placement of the amplifiers, in order to obtain the desired bit-error rate (BER) at each of the receivers, following the approach in <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, in this study, we do not consider system factors such as amplifier ASE noise and crosstalk at the receivers, explicitly; these factors are assumed to be implicitly incorporated in the parameter p sen . <p> These problems can be bypassed by restricting all of the wavelengths at any given point in a fiber to be at the same power level. In previous work <ref> [3] </ref>, the amplifier-placement scheme operated on a link-by-link basis by maintaining the power level of all the wavelengths at the output of each star at the lowest possible value (i.e., the receiver sensitivity level, p sen ). <p> Numerical examples will show that this global optimization method can result in a significant savings in the number of amplifiers over the link-by-link approach in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 1.2 Amplifier Gain Model Previous studies [3] used the gain model in Fig. 2. In this model, it is assumed that the full small-signal gain is realizable until the point at which the amplifier output becomes power-limited. <p> Numerical examples will show that this global optimization method can result in a significant savings in the number of amplifiers over the link-by-link approach in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 1.2 Amplifier Gain Model Previous studies [3] used the gain model in Fig. 2. In this model, it is assumed that the full small-signal gain is realizable until the point at which the amplifier output becomes power-limited. At this point, the amplifier is assumed to enter saturation and the gain starts to drop. <p> This "point" of saturation occurs in the example of Fig. 2 at a total input power of 20 dBm. At lower input powers, the amplifier is assumed to be able to supply the full small-signal gain of G max = 20 dB. mations used in previous studies <ref> [3] </ref>. used in this study. <p> At high input powers, the gain available at the amplifier is limited to the saturation output power, P max , as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 3. The value of P max is retained as 1 mW (0 dBm) as in earlier work <ref> [3] </ref>, in order to facilitate comparison of the two amplifier-placement algorithms. Hence, the model used throughout this paper, follows the solid line in Fig. 3 for low input powers and the dashed line for high input powers. <p> This is due to the fact that we employ only "passive" optical stars in the network, i.e., there is no scope for signal amplification within a star. As shown in <ref> [3] </ref>, we only need to ensure that the power level of each input signal on every input link to a star is high enough to guarantee that the signal exits the star on every output link at a power level of at least p sen . <p> A study on optimum amplifier location in spectrum-spliced WDM passive optical networks can be found in [17]. 2.6 Lower-Bound Analysis In this section, lower bounds on the number of amplifiers required for a given network to operate, using the link-by-link method (from <ref> [3] </ref>) and the global method (described in this paper), are derived.

Note that, while these lower bounds may not always be achievable, they help characterize the nature of the two methods. The link-by-link method in [3] forces the powers of all wavelengths to be equal to p sen at the beginning of all links originating at a star. The transmitter powers can be adjusted to avoid placing amplifiers on the links which originate at a station. <p> This is similar to the example network studied in <ref> [3] </ref> except that the size of group 3 has been decreased from 35 to 28 to make the network feasible for 16 the values of P max = 0 dBm and p sen = 30 dBm.

In this regard, note that the corresponding original example network in [3] was infeasible for its choice of network parameters. The network has N = 63 stations and M = 4 passive stars. The number of amplifiers required using the algorithm in [3] is 79. The optimum number of amplifiers as obtained by our algorithms in Section 2 is 77. <p> In this regard, note that the corresponding original example network in <ref> [3] </ref> was infeasible for its choice of network parameters. The network has N = 63 stations and M = 4 passive stars. The number of amplifiers required using the algorithm in [3] is 79. The optimum number of amplifiers as obtained by our algorithms in Section 2 is 77. The difference in the number of amplifiers is not significant for this topology. <p> However, if we reduce the distance of the stations from the stars to 7.13 km, our global optimum method uses only 62 amplifiers against the 79 used by <ref> [3] </ref>, a 21% savings! This savings of these 15 amplifiers (from 77 to 62) occurs at the access links from star 3 to the stations in group 2. <p> The complete MILP formulation for this network can be found in [18]. Module III contains the MILP solver and outputs the optimum value of the objective function and the variables (p i 's, n l 's and SG l 's).

We notice that our global optimum method performs much better than the link-by-link method in [3], especially for networks with short access links. We explain the difference below. The link-by-link method was designed to equalize the power levels of the wavelengths in the network, as opposed to trying to minimize the number of amplifiers in the network. <p> Finally, an amplifier-placement algorithm was run to determine the exact placement of the optical amplifiers. Numerical examples showed that this scheme has the potential to save a significant number of amplifiers over the scheme in <ref> [3] </ref>, which just attempted to perform power equalization. With optical amplifiers remaining very expensive, our scheme can significantly reduce network costs. We consider elsewhere [10] the problem of minimizing the number of amplifiers without the constraint on power equalization. This approach may result in utilizing fewer amplifiers under certain circumstances.

Reference-contexts: Due to the difference in power levels, the higher-powered wavelengths could saturate the amplifier and limit the gain seen by the lower-powered wavelengths. Moreover, allowing wavelengths in the same fiber to be at different power levels results in a mixed-integer non-linear program <ref> [10] </ref> for the optimal amplifier placement problem, and it cannot be solved exactly. These problems can be bypassed by restricting all of the wavelengths at any given point in a fiber to be at the same power level. <p> Numerical examples showed that this scheme has the potential to save a significant number of amplifiers over the scheme in [3], which just attempted to perform power equalization.
