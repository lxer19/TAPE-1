Title: Augmented and alternative NLP techniques for augmentative and alternative communication  
Author: Ann Copestake 
Address: Ventura Hall, Stanford, CA 94305, USA  
Affiliation: Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University,  
Abstract: Current communication devices designed for non-speaking users are inadequate to support conversation because the speed with which a user can input information is typically very limited. We describe some practical work on word prediction, and discuss its limitations as a technique for speeding up free text entry. We then outline an alternative approach, currently under development, which combines prediction with a constrained technique for nat ural language generation.

Reference-contexts: The research described here concentrates on the latter aspect, although the utility of various techniques is partially dependent on the interface. Techniques which have been used in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) often involve the use of alternative symbol systems for input, in particular Minspeak <ref> (Baker, 1982) </ref>. However, the work reported here was prompted by the needs of an individual who has lost the ability to speak due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). Such users would prefer to continue using their original language, rather than to learn an alternative symbol system.
