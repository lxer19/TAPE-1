Reference-contexts: In some sense, P P determines the highest bit of the #P answer. It is shown that one can use a P P oracle to determine each bit of the #P answer. This means that P P P = P #P (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Toda shows P H P P P by showing that P is in between the two classes under randomized reductions. To avoid dealing with randomized reductions, Toda calls this in-between class BP P which can be viewed as a randomized version of P .

Reference-contexts: There are two key results in this derivation, one for each inclusion. The first inclusion, P H BP P , is based on a result of Valiant and Vazirani <ref> [3] </ref>, which we present first. The second inclusion, BP P P #P , is based on a manipulation of a parity machine which makes the magnitude of the number of accepting paths on any input more predictable.
