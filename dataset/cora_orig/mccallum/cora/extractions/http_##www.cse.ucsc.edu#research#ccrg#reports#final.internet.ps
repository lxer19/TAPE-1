Abstract: This document describes the work completed at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the project "Scalable Internetworking" sponsored by ARPA under Contract No. F19628-93-C-0175. This report covers work performed from 1 April 1993 to 31 December 1995. Results on routing and multicasting for large-scale internets are summarized. The technical material discussed assumes familiarity with the content of our proposal and previous quarterly reports submitted in this project.

Reference-contexts: This complicates inter-domain multicasting if the domains involved use different unicast routing. The unicast routing is also made more complicated by incorporating the multicast-related requirements. To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture <ref> [1] </ref> and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture [3]. Although both approaches constitute a substantial improvement over the current multicast architecture, each protocol has its own limitations.

Reference-contexts: Parsa, and J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "A Protocol for Scalable Loop-Free Multicast Routing," submitted to IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 1996. Multicasting is supported in local area networks (LANs), using hardware technologies. Recently, multicasting has been extended to internetworks by Deering <ref> [2] </ref>. Based on Deering's work and built into the TCP/IP protocol suite, the internet group message protocol (IGMP) is used to disseminate multicast membership information to multicast routers. Deering's method permits routers to figure out dynamically how to forward messages. A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. <p> These results are summarized in Reference <ref> [2] </ref>. We also analyzed the behavior of the source policy in the rate-based congestion control algorithm being developed by the ATM Forum and derived approximate analytical closed-form expressions to describe the rate-increase process.

Reference-contexts: This complicates inter-domain multicasting if the domains involved use different unicast routing. The unicast routing is also made more complicated by incorporating the multicast-related requirements. To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture [1] and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture <ref> [3] </ref>. Although both approaches constitute a substantial improvement over the current multicast architecture, each protocol has its own limitations. A main limitation of CBT is that it constructs only a single tree per group and thus provides longer end-to-end delays than would be obtained along a shortest-path tree. <p> When an idle-detection policy is enabled at the source, 12 the slow-start process is significantly prolonged, and results in slower recovery upon a cell loss. The results are verified by simulation. Reference <ref> [3] </ref> contains a summary of this work.

Reference-contexts: Previous optimization techniques for multicast routing algorithms have considered the above two optimization objectives, but have treated them as distinct problems. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> can be used to generate the shortest paths from the source to destination nodes; this provides the optimal solution for delay optimization. Multicast routing algorithms that perform cost optimization have been based on minimum Steiner tree which is known to be NP-complete problem [6].

Reference-contexts: RBP works in a similar way to PIF for the case of a static network. However, in contrast to prior approaches of reliable broadcasting in dynamic networks, our proposed protocol requires the source to send each broadcast message only once, and diffusing computations <ref> [5] </ref> are used to eliminate the need for the source node to control the propagation of information in multiple rounds. An important contribution of this paper is the adaptation of Dijkstra and Scholten's basic scheme to dynamic topologies.

Multicast routing algorithms that perform cost optimization have been based on minimum Steiner tree which is known to be NP-complete problem <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Bharath-Kumar and Jaffe discuss optimization on both cost and delay [7]. However, they assume that cost and delay functions are identical. Kompella, Pasquale and Polyzos <ref> [8] </ref> propose two heuristics (which we call the KPP algorithm) that address delay-bounded 7 Steiner trees; the KPP algorithm extends the KMB algorithm by taking into account an integer-valued delay bound in the construction of shortest paths.

Some heuristics for the Steiner tree problem <ref> [9, 14, 18] </ref> have been developed that take polynomial time and produce near optimum results.

Reference-contexts: PIF terminates when the source node receives its own message from all its neighbors. All reliable broadcast protocols based on flooding that have been proposed for dynamic topologies in the past (e.g., [15]) are based on the routing protocol by Merlin and Segall <ref> [10] </ref>. These protocols proceed in cycles triggered and terminating at the source of the message. A cycle consists of two phases. First, the message propagates one additional hop away from the source, then acknowledgments to the message propagate towards the source.

Reference-contexts: A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. The tree in the existing IP architecture is the reverse shortest-path tree and shortest-path tree from the source to the group for distance-vector (i.e., DVMRP [19]) and link-state routing (i.e., MOSPF <ref> [11] </ref>), respectively. For example, the Multicast Backbone (MBone) in today's Internet consists of a set of routers running DVMRP. However, there are several shortcomings with the existing IP multicast architecture, i.e., DVMRP and MOSPF.

Reference-contexts: In Kou, Markowsky and Berman's (KMB) algorithm [9], a network is abstracted to a complete graph consisting of edges that represent the shortest paths among source node and destination nodes. The KMB algorithm applies Prim's algorithm <ref> [13] </ref> to construct a minimum spanning tree in the complete graph, and the Steiner tree of the original network is obtained by achieving the shortest paths represented by edges in the minimum spanning tree.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, little work exists on reliable broadcast protocols in dynamic networks; most broadcast protocols proposed in the past (e.g., <ref> [15] </ref>) [16] are based on what Segall calls the propagation of information (PI) protocol and the propagation of information with feedback protocol (PIF) [16]. <p> PIF terminates when the source node receives its own message from all its neighbors.

PI is basic flooding; it starts by the source node sending a message containing the information to all its neighbors, and each other node in the network sends a similar message to its own neighbors when it receives the first such message.
