Abstract: We give a linear-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths in planar graphs with nonnegative edge-lengths. Our algorithm also yields a linear-time algorithm for maximum flow in a planar graph with the source and sink on the same face. The previous best algorithms for these problems required (n log n) time where n is the number of nodes in the input graph. For the case where negative edge-lengths are allowed, we give an algorithm requiring O(n 4=3 log nL) time, where L is the absolute value of the most negative length. Previous algorithms for shortest paths with negative edge-lengths required (n 3=2 ) time. Our shortest-path algorithm yields an O(n 4=3 log n)- time algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a planar bipartite graph. A similar improvement is
