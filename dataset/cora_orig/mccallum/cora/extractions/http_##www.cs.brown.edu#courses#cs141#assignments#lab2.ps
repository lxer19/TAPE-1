Note: Computer Science 141 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Lab #2 Financial Forecasting Out  
Abstract: This lab is designed to let you play around with various forms of financial forcasting, particularly delay coordinate embedding. Unfortunately, there's a lot of black magic in forcasting financial markets, and this technology has its magic incarnations, too. You should get a good feel for what these algorithms are capable of, and where they fail miserably. Here is what financial forecasting is all about: you've got a lot of data, indexed by time (e.g. I know the price of a particular stock, or a set of stocks, each day for the past n days). Given this large body of apparently random data, we'd like to find patterns that predict (at least approximately) future trends in the data. There exist a multitude of statistical techniques/tricks/voodoo to cope with this sort of data. At the simplest level, one can use descriptive techiques to characterize the data. Usualy, these sort of methods tell you about the cyclic properties of the time series of interest, things like "grain prices are low in summer, high in the winter". You might also be able to determine information about trends in the data. However, you never know if you have enough data. What appears to be a simple rising trend, may actually be just the growth cycle of a repeating pattern. Even a high-brow text on time series will suggest a fairly naive heurstic for time series analysis: look at a plot of the data. Remember, people are still better at this than computers, and for good reason: we have an uncany ability to find patterns in data. But even in this relatively simple proposition there is ample room for confusion and complication. There are countless ways to introduce bias into your data and mask trends and cycles as a result of an unfortunate choice of scale, the way the points are plotted, ad infinitum. In the context of delay coordinate embedding, a situation corresponds to a time and a description of the events surrounding that time. In predicting a particular stock, we're really only interested in events that correlate with changes in the price of that stock. The price of a stock on a given day obviously correlates well with the price of the stock on earlier days and on the price of other stocks (especially stocks of the same sort or in the same "sector" of the market). We are going to represent the situation corresponding to a particular day as a vector of vectors of stock prices called a delay coordinate. To simplify, we assume that we have the closing prices for all m stocks on every day since the market opened n days ago (which in our case would be 100 days ago). Let P (s; t) denote the closing price of stock s on day t. The k-width delay coordinate for day t for k t n is a k-component vector consisting of m-component vectors of stock prices:
