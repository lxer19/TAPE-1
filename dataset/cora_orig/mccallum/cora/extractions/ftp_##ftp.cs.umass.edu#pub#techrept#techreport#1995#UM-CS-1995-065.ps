Abstract: CMPSCI Technical Report 95-65 July 1995 Abstract This report describes the models and features used to represent sounds in the IPUS (Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals) Sound Understanding Testbed. It also catalogues the forty-five sounds in the acoustic library used to generate scenarios for testing the C.2 configuration of the testbed.

Reference-contexts: With the exception of the impulsive sounds "Knock," and "Clap," all sounds were extracted from a commercial tape provided by Auditec of St. Louis, Incorporated <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: NOISEBED: the wideband component of impulsive areas within a sound source's acoustic signature. Microstreams (tracks) often form "ridges" on top of noisebed "plateaux," but not every noisebed has well-defined microstreams associated with it. STREAM: we apply perceptual streaming criteria developed in the psychoacoustic research community <ref> [2] </ref> to group microstreams and noisebeds as support for stream hypotheses, or entities to be recognized as sound-sources. Specifically, our testbed knowledge sources group microstreams together when they have similar fates (e.g. synchronized onset- and end-times, synchronized chirp behavior), or when they share a harmonic relationship.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The C.2 configuration of the IPUS SUT (Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals Sound Understanding Testbed) is intended to serve as a research vehicle to explore (1) the use of approximate processing techniques within the basic IPUS framework <ref> [3] </ref> and (2) the scalability of the framework in handling moderately large sound libraries and complicated acoustic scenarios.

Reference-contexts: This level also maintain statistics such as zero-crossing density and average energy for each block of signal data. SPECTROGRAM: spectral hypotheses derived for each waveform segment through algorithms such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and the Quantized Short <br>- Time Fourier Transform (QSTFT) <ref> [4] </ref>, an approximate SPA. PEAK: peak spectral energy regions in each time-slice in a spectrogram. These indicate narrow-band features in a signal's spectral representation. SHIFT: sudden energy changes in the time-domain envelope.
