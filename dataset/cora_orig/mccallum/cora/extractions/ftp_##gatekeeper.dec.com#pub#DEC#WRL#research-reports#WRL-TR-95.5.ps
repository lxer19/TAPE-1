Reference-contexts: The state would provide raw materials for the voter information, and a direct feed of returns once the polls had closed. Digital would operate both a World-Wide Web (WWW) server using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP [2]), and a Gopher <ref> [1] </ref> server. Although the state officials seemed more interested in the Gopher server, we expected that the WWW server would prove far more popular, and concentrated our efforts there.

Since MSL should be two minutes, 2*MSL should be four minutes; however, DEC OSF/1 follows 4.3BSD practice and uses a one-minute timeout here. The HTTP specification <ref> [2] </ref> requires that the server, not the client, close the TCP connection.

Reference-contexts: Almost none of the connections required more than five retransmissions. mean the interval between the original transmission, and the first retransmission.) The distribution peaks at about 3 seconds, which is consistent with the recommended initial estimate <ref> [4] </ref>. Since the SYN is the first packet of the connection, the sender should use a conservative initial estimate, to avoid retransmitting too soon. About 4% of the clients' retransmitted SYNs, however, arrived within 1 second of the previous SYN. <p> RFC1122 <ref> [4] </ref> recommends a smaller minimum, but the original TCP specification [15] specified this 1-second value. The additional 0.3 seconds probably represents an estimate of the variance in round-trip times.

Reference-contexts: Recent work by others has suggested that network arrival patterns are self-similar rather than Poisson [10], and that the self-similarity arises from the behavior of ``on/off'' sources [17]. Crovella and Bestavros have shown this specifically for other HTTP traces <ref> [5] </ref>. One characteristic of such sources is a long tail in the interarrival time distribution, such as is seen in figures 7-7 through 7-9. 8.

Reference-contexts: Many clients reach Web servers via caching relays or proxy servers <ref> [6] </ref>; these caching relays intercept the requests for HTML files and so can hide updates of the dynamic pages from clients. In most cases, properly informed users could work around this problem (for example, by hitting a ``Reload'' button).

Reference-contexts: Most of these TCP connections will be operating in the ``slow-start'' regime <ref> [7] </ref>, in which the sender uses an artificially small window, and so will not be able to obtain full network bandwidth, especially over high-delay paths. 8.2. <p> TCP retransmissions TCP senders retransmit packets when they do not receive an acknowledgement within a timeout interval. The timeout value is a function of the sender's estimated round-trip time (RTT), following algorithms that have been developed over years of experience and analysis <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. One can learn several things about the network and its packet sources by observing TCP packet retransmissions in tcpdump traces, and analyzing the retransmission counts and inter-arrival times. 8.3.1.

Reference-contexts: However, large PCB tables not only consume memory; they also consume CPU cycles, because they must be searched on each packet arrival to find the corresponding TCP state record. 11 NETWORK BEHAVIOR OF A BUSY WEB SERVER AND ITS CLIENTS McKenney and Dove <ref> [11] </ref> have pointed out that the use of a linear list for this table can lead to poor performance, and suggest using a hash table for systems with large numbers of active connections.

Reference-contexts: Circles: outgoing packets; Triangles: incoming packets; Squares: all Election-server packets 7.2. Request arrivals daemons themselves. The open circles show the arrivals seen by all server hosts taken together (the host clocks were synchronized using NTP, probably to better than 1 msec <ref> [12] </ref>). The dotted line shows the Poisson distribution with the same mean arrival rate.

Reference-contexts: We maintained an identical copy of the server contents on the disks of each of the three server machines. Since we wanted to expose only a single top-level URL, and hence a single host name, to clients, we used the Domain Name System (DNS) <ref> [13] </ref> CNAME mechanism to create a three-valued binding from www.election.ca.gov to the actual names of the three server hosts. We hoped that since modern DNS servers randomize the order in which they return the three bindings, clients would end up evenly balanced among the servers.

Reference-contexts: Each TCP connection takes up an entry in this table. One would think that the table size should be approximately the number of active connections, but this is not so. The TCP protocol specification <ref> [15] </ref> requires the host that closes a connection to remain in the TIME_WAIT state for a period of twice the maximum segment lifetime (2*MSL). This prevents a subsequent connection from accepting delayed duplicate packets from the closed connection. <p> RFC1122 [4] recommends a smaller minimum, but the original TCP specification <ref> [15] </ref> specified this 1-second value. The additional 0.3 seconds probably represents an estimate of the variance in round-trip times.

Reference-contexts: However, traceroute uses an indirect mechanism and does not always yield a full path; it can also be confused by shifting paths. Ping simply sends a series of ICMP Echo <ref> [16] </ref> packets to the destination, and measures the time until the corresponding ICMP Echo Reply packets come back. I used ping to make ten measurements to each destination with each of two packet sizes, 56 bytes and 536 bytes.
