Title: MeshView: Interactive Visualization of 3D Unstructured Meshes

Abstract: We have developed a new computational module for interactively visualizing large-scale 3D unstructured finite element meshes. The program includes two novel real-time interactive methods that overcome the difficulties of visualizing unstructured 3D grids on 2D screens: a clipping surface utility and a growth algorithm. Used separately or together, these new utilities allow the user to better explore complicated unstructured polygonal domains.

Reference-contexts: MeshView contains a suite of options to provide the user with complete interactive control. The module is part of a data-flow based computational steering system, SciRun, used for the interactive control of science and engineering boundary value problems. <ref> [1] </ref>. SciRun provides MeshView with standard viewing capabilites such as rotation, translation, and scaling. METHODS MeshView allows the user to choose from a variety of different options for exploring the mesh. These include clipping isosurfaces and a growth algorithm, each with several attributes the user can change. <p> By allowing the user to explore the mesh in different ways, the program gives the user the information needed to understand the spatial relationships be tween the 3D elements. RESULTS Data enters MeshView via SciRun, the computational steering program <ref> [1] </ref>. Set up within SciRun is a map consisting of an input module, computation module (s), and an output module. In this case, the input module reads in the data points and connectivities of the mesh. The computation module contains the algorithms developed for MeshView.

Reference-contexts: However, unstructured meshes present the more difficult task of grasping spatial relationships of unstructed 3D objects in 2-space. Mesh visualization is important for assessing solution accuracy, geometrical integrity (identifyingmissing and/or distorted elements), and interactive editing. One common technique to assist in viewing these meshes is to use clipping planes <ref> [2] </ref>. However, when applied to unstructured meshes, a clipping plane cuts through portions of elements, leaving line segments on the edges of the mesh. Speray and Kennon addressed this problem by devising a method of volume probes for interactive data exploration [4].

Reference-contexts: In this case, the input module reads in the data points and connectivities of the mesh. The computation module contains the algorithms developed for MeshView. The output module is the geometry viewer, which displays the mesh. The program is written in C++ using Tk/Tcl <ref> [3] </ref>. MeshView is currently implemented on SGI workstations, but ports to other platforms are in progress.

Reference-contexts: However, when applied to unstructured meshes, a clipping plane cuts through portions of elements, leaving line segments on the edges of the mesh. Speray and Kennon addressed this problem by devising a method of volume probes for interactive data exploration <ref> [4] </ref>. This method cuts sections of grids and displays them on 2D surfaces. However, the volume relationships between elements is lost when this technique is applied to elements displayed as 2D surfaces. To overcome these problems, we have developed a package called MeshView for visualizing 3D structured and unstructed meshes.
