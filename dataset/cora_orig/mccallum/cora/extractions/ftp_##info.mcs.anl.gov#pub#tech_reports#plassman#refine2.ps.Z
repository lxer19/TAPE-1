Abstract: Computational methods based on the use of adaptively constructed nonuniform meshes reduce the amount of computation and storage necessary to perform many scientific calculations. The adaptive construction of such nonuniform meshes is an important part of these methods. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for adaptive mesh refinement that is suitable for implementation on distributed-memory parallel computers. Experimental results obtained on the Intel DELTA are presented to demonstrate that, for scientific computations involving the finite element method, the algorithm exhibits scalable performance and has a small run time in comparison with other aspects of the scientific computations examined. It is also shown that the algorithm has a fast expected running time under the PRAM computation model.

Reference-contexts: A final requirement is that all angles in the mesh be bounded away from 0 and . The latter condition is necessary because the discretization error in a finite element approximation has been shown to grow as the maximum angle approaches <ref> [1] </ref>. We would like to avoid small angles because the condition number of the matrices arising from mesh elements has been shown to grow as O ( 1 min ), where min is the smallest angle in the mesh [5]. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: The parallel refinement algorithm is implemented as a subroutine library that can be called by an application program. Chameleon <ref> [6] </ref> is used to achieve portability across several architectures, including the Intel DELTA, which is the focus of this section. Note that in addition to the refinement algorithm, the subroutine library also includes a similarly constructed, parallel unrefinement algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. Adaptive mesh refinement techniques have been shown to be very successful in reducing the computational and storage requirements for solving many partial differential equations <ref> [12] </ref>. Rather than use a uniform mesh with grid points evenly spaced on a domain, adaptive mesh refinement techniques place more grid points in areas where the local error in the solution is large. <p> The adaptive construction of these nonuniform meshes is a crucial part of adaptive mesh solution methods and has been examined by many researchers, for example, [3], <ref> [12] </ref>, [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], and [20]. Typically, one begins with an initial mesh conforming to a particular geometry. This mesh is selectively refined, based on local error estimates, to construct a mesh that satisfies a certain error tolerance. <p> A framework for the adaptive solution of PDEs Consider the general adaptive mesh algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> shown in Figure 1. We begin by assuming that we have an initial element mesh given by the triangulation T 0 consistent with the geometry of the problem domain. <p> The propagation inherent in the bisection and regular refinement algorithms is avoided by refining triangles only in pairs. However, because of the pair restriction, it is possible that a triangle may never be able to be refined. A modification proposed by Mitchell <ref> [12] </ref> eliminates this problem by ensuring that every triangle is one of a pair of triangles that can be refined. Unfortunately, this modification requires the recursive refinement of triangles adjacent 3 to unrefinable triangles. This refinement gives rise to a propagation similar to the bisection and regular refinement algorithms. <p> This refinement gives rise to a propagation similar to the bisection and regular refinement algorithms. Mitchell compared these three methods in a series of numerical experiments and found that it was difficult to choose a consistently superior algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. In addition, he found that all three methods were superior to using uniform refinement except on smooth problems. <p> The function f (x) is a Gaussian charge distribution centered at a point (S x ; S y ) inside the domain. The mesh is selectively refined according to the energy norm <ref> [12] </ref> until the estimate of the local error on each triangle is less than a specified tolerance. Further, the point (S x ; S y ) is moved several times, and a new solution/mesh is found from the old solution/mesh.

Reference-contexts: We note, however, that our algorithms are applicable to all three algorithms. Only a simple modification to our parallel implementation is required to implement the unmodified newest-node algorithm. Williams <ref> [21] </ref> has developed a voxel database approach to the parallel mesh refinement problem. Our approach, which we present in the following section, differs from his approach in that we have explicit parallel runtime bounds.
