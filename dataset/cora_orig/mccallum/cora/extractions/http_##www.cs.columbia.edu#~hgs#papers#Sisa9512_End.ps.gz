Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ensuring both high utilization of the available bandwidth and a minimum cell loss rate requires efficient as well as fair congestion control schemes. These schemes should achieve three goals <ref> [1] </ref>: 1. At a minimum, the quality of service (QOS) negotiated during the connection establishment has to be satisfied for each source. 2. Unused bandwidth should be fairly distributed among the active connections. 3.

Reference-contexts: In this context the effects of the value of the multiplicative decrease factor in determining the throughput and fairness performance are investigated. Sisalem:End-to-End Rate Control in ABR 2 2 Simulation Environment To compare the different algorithms a simple generic fairness configuration <ref> [2] </ref> was chosen. With this topology, see Fig. 1, the fairness of bandwidth allocation can be tested for the case of cascaded congested links. For a quantitative description of fairness Jain [3] suggests using the so called fairness index.

For a quantitative description of fairness Jain <ref> [3] </ref> suggests using the so called fairness index. F = P n i x 2 with x i as the ratio of the actual throughput to the fair throughput and n as the number of connections.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we would expect the fair bandwidth share of each source to be half of the available link bandwidth, i.e., 77.5 Mbps. 3 Proportional Rate Control Algorithm The proportional rate control algorithm (PRCA) is based on the positive feedback rate control scheme <ref> [4] </ref>. In this scheme the rate can only be increased if a positive indication, in this case a RM cell, was received. Otherwise, the rate is decreased after each sent cell.

Reference-contexts: proposal, the generic fairness topology presented in Fig. 1 was used with the parameters of Tab. 1, a multiplicative decrease factor (MDF y ) of 8 and with N rm set to 32. fl Nrm was set to 32 as was done in various contributions to the ATM Forum, see <ref> [5, 6] </ref> y Rate reduction in this algorithm is done in the form of ACR = ACR 2 MDF with ACR as the allowed cell rate of the source.

As the switch specifics will not be standardized by the ATM Forum the actual algorithm for calculating the fair bandwidth share can take any other shape that fulfills the fairness requirements, see [9,10]. Sisalem:End-to-End Rate Control in ABR 5 Sisalem:End-to-End Rate Control in ABR 6 1. <p> Using the same congestion threshold the EPRCA proposal achieves high utilization of around 97% and a fairness index of 0.99. Fig. 4 shows that for this configuration a buffer of only 70 cells suffices to avoid cell losses. Under various other topologies, see <ref> [6] </ref>, similar results were achieved. z Rate reduction in this algorithm is done in the form of ACR = ACR 2 MDF with ACR as the allowed cell rate of the source.

Reference-contexts: This resulted in a fairness index of only 0.817. 4 Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm As an example for an algorithm using explicit rate indication we briefly introduce in this section the enhanced proportional rate control algorithm (EPRCA). This algorithm is based on determining the advertised rate (A-rate) <ref> [7] </ref>. This rate is computed as the capacity available (B) minus the capacity of the constrained VCs divided by the total number of VCs (N ) minus the number of constrained VCs. <p> Our results suggest the superiority of explicit rate indication schemes over the bit marking ones in terms of link utilization and fairness. However, the currently available switch algorithms for determining the per VC fair bandwidth share require per VC accounting and are therefore very computation intensive <ref> [7] </ref> or converge only very slowly to the steady state as we have seen here with the EPRCA algorithm. Therefore, further work must be done in order to implement simple yet efficient schemes for the fair rate share calculation.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, EPRCA estimates the value of the A-rate by computing a mean allowed cell rate (MACR) using exponential weighted averaging. MACR = (1 ff)MACR + ffACR Here, ff is the exponential averaging factor and is usually set to 1=6 <ref> [8] </ref>. ACR is the currently allowed cell rate of the connection. Using the EPRCA scheme for implementing the explicit rate scheme must be seen only as one possible solution that has proven to work fine and is often used in simulation studies [6].

Reference-contexts: Source End System Behavior The source starts sending cells at an initial cell rate (ICR) with EFCI set to 0. Every Nrm sent data cells a RM cell is generated by the source. The RM cells have to at least carry the following parameters <ref> [11] </ref>: * Allowed cell rate (ACR): This value is used mainly to selectively indicate congestion on connections passing a congested link.

However, instead of using the EFCI bit for congestion indication the source sends a RM cell every N sent data cells.

Reference-contexts: However, various studies [13,14] show that integrating TCP and ABR might lead to performance degradation in TCP. A simple method for overcoming this problem would be to enhance TCP with a bit marking congestion control algorithm. Our investigations <ref> [14] </ref> suggest that this would not only ease the integration of TCP and ABR but might even improve TCP's performance. However, the considerable fairness problems noticed require further work.
