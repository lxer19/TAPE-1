Abstract: How does working within a unified theory of cognition an architecture provide useful constraint when modeling large timescale tasks, where performance is primarily determined by knowledge, rather than the architecture's basic mechanisms? We present a methodology for extracting the constraint that comes from the architecture, by deriving a set of architectural entailments which afford certain model properties over others. The methodology allows us to factor the effect that various architectural properties have on a model. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study: a model of learning procedures from natural language instructions, Instructo-Soar, within the Soar architecture.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we can now make 8 arguments about what effect changing individual properties of the architecture may have on the model. Entailments provide an intermediate level of granularity to compare architectures at. Where another architecture's entailments differ, the figure indicates which model properties are affected. For instance, ACT* <ref> [Anderson, 1983] </ref> has a declarative long-term memory in addition to a production memory. This entails a fully penetrable, non-associative memory, that could be used to store instructions as they are read.

Reference-contexts: Although situated, interactive instruction has been shown to be highly effective <ref> [Bloom, 1984] </ref>, there have not been many studies of learning effects during this type of instruction. Most studies of instruction have either focussed on broad instructional strategies, or on the effect of linguistic form of individual instructions (see [Bovair and Kieras, 1990; Singley and Anderson, 1989] for reviews).

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that subjects learn better when they have more prior knowledge of the domain [Kieras and Bovair, 1984], which our model predicts. Also, subjects learning from worked-out examples learn more general knowledge when they attempt to explain each step of the example (the self-explanation effect <ref> [Chi et al., 1989] </ref>). Although not interactive instructions, the worked-out examples provide a similar kind of information to the student. The Instructo-Soar model exhibits two stages of learning behavior in learning a new procedure. Initial learning is rote and episodic in nature, and exhibits low transfer. <p> Thus, self-explanation <ref> [Chi et al., 1989] </ref> improves both (9) performance time and (10) transfer subjects who do not attempt such explanations will achieve only low-transfer; and (11) the amount and quality of transfer achieved depends on the amount and quality of prior domain knowledge of the subject subjects with minimal domain knowledge will

Reference-contexts: Interactive means that the student requests instruction when it is needed; situated means that the student is within the task domain, attempting to perform tasks, during the instruction episode. The model is embodied in a system, Instructo-Soar, which has been described elsewhere <ref> [Huffman and Laird, 1993] </ref>. Instructions are given to Instructo-Soar in natural language sentences, requested whenever there is an impasse in task performance. The system can learn completely new procedures, learning both the goal concept (what it means to successfully perform the procedure) and how to perform the procedure. <p> Empirically, we have found that this execution time decrease displays the power law of practice <ref> [Huffman and Laird, 1993] </ref>. After some number of executions, the procedure is fully generalized.

Reference-contexts: The chunking process is impenetrable to the agent; it cannot learn to alter its architectural learning process. 1 [6] 13. Monotonic learning. Productions are never removed from long-term memory; once learned, chunks cannot be forgotten. However, their effects can be overridden by other chunks to recover from incorrect learning <ref> [Laird, 1988] </ref>. [2,4,6] 14. Routine learning. Chunking is part of the routine performance of the agent, rather than a special process that is deliberately invoked by the agent.

Reference-contexts: However, as the timescale increases, to the level of minutes or hours for task performance, behavior is determined more and more by an intelligent agent's knowledge. This is Newell's intendedly rational band <ref> [Newell, 1990] </ref>, in which the agent moves towards approximating a pure knowledge-level system. The large timescale allows the agent to retrieve, compose, and apply relevant knowledge to reach its goals within the current task environment. <p> knowledge and little computational apparatus and indirection...One of the general arguments for the importance of getting the architecture right, even though it appears to recede as the time scale increases, is that doing what is natural within the architecture will tend to be the way humans actually do a task." <ref> [Newell, 1990, p. 416-17] </ref> 2.3 Human behavior data Ideally, we would like to produce operational models that reproduce human behavior. Unfortunately, human data is strongly colored by subjects' prior knowledge, especially for knowledge-level capabilities. <p> A second strategy for dealing with prior knowledge is to structure the model so that prior knowledge can be a parameter to the model. A Soar model of cryptarithmetic <ref> [Newell, 1990] </ref> provides an extreme example of this. In this model, the results of subjects' performance of particular sub-operations, such as choosing the next digit to assign to a letter, are taken directly from protocol data (i.e., parameterized). <p> Newell points out that "this allows us to test the upper levels without the lower levels, the conceptual advantage being to factor out the influences of the lower levels by 2 design beforehand, rather than by analysis from the total simulation record" <ref> [Newell, 1990, p. 376] </ref>. Within a UTC-based model of a particular task, parameters should be at the knowledge level, involving the presence (or absence) of knowledge.
