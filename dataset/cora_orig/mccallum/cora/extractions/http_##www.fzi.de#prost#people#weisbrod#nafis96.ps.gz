Title: Reinforcement-driven adaptation of control relations

Abstract: The conceptual framework of a hybrid control system architecture is briefly motivated. It employs neural and fuzzy techniques on a side-by-side basis using each one for the task it is best suited for. In this paper, our main interest is with the adaptation of the fuzzy control knowledge. The adaptation algorithm is based on reinforcement signals and directly optimizes the global fuzzy relation representing the complete knowledge base. The new approach is experimentally evaluated.

The adaptation algorithm modifies the meta control relation according to reinforcements generated by a separate adaptive critic component. The adaptation algorithm was experimentally evaluated and proved excellent performance.

Reference-contexts: It follows that the fuzzy set oriented update performs best with regard to speed of learning and smoothness of adaptation. The neighborhood incorporating update lays between the fuzzy set oriented update and the point-wise update. These results are conform with other experiments completed in <ref> [6] </ref>. Due to the static character of the task only slight effects are observable. The best performance is achieved with fl close to 1. The second graph in figure 3 shows set oriented update (r = 2; fl = 1).

Reference-contexts: The discount factor fl was introduced to discount the relation in situations where the process response patterns change. A similar operator was introduced in <ref> [10] </ref>. IV Experiments In this section the adaptation scheme is applied to function approximation tasks. In these tasks a controller is adapted such that it approximates a given function. <p> It should be noted that the error measure depends on the chosen discretization and the range of function values. The error should therefore be interpreted in a relative manner. IV.1 Adaptation with and without a priori knowledge of f (x) = x; x 2 <ref> [0; 10] </ref>. The meta relation was initialized with a set of rules describing f in straight forward manner (uniform partitioning of domain, 4 rules). The rules were randomly distorted. <p> The best performance is achieved with fl close to 1. The second graph in figure 3 shows set oriented update (r = 2; fl = 1). Second row: Adapted fuzzy relations for the approximation of f 1 (x) = x; x 2 <ref> [0; 10] </ref>. set oriented update (both figures, solid line, fl = 1, r == 5), two dimensional update fixed variance (left figure, dashed line, oe = 0:4), two dimensional update time-decaying variance (left figure, solid line, oe i = 1:5; oe f = 0:2) and point-wise update (right figure, solid upper <p> This is achieved by altering the function underlying the approximation task in the above experiments. Figures 6 and 7 show the results for different parameters. (cf. <ref> [10] </ref> for similar experiment in a supervised learning setting.) V Conclusions We discuss a reinforcement-driven fuzzy relation adaptation algorithm which is part of a complexer hybrid con fl (fl = 1 (solid line), fl = 0:8 (dash dot line), fl = 0:5 (dashed line), fl = 0:3 (solid line)).
