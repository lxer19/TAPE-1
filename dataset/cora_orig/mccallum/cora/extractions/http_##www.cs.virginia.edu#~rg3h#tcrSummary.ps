Abstract: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE Many existing virtual environments/graphics systems, such as Sense8s WorldToolkit [6] and IRIS Inventor [8], work within a single process. This couples the graphics rendering rate (based on the movement of the users head) to the underlying simulations computation speed. If one were simulating a billiard table, for example, and the collision detection module were only capable of calculating at two frames per second, the users visual system would be forced to update at two frames per second as well. If I separate the simulation computation rate from the rendering frames, I gain the ability to render scenes in real-time, even when simulation computations become more complicated. RENDERING SCHEDULER Within the rendering engine a rendering scheduler adaptively executes time-critical rendering algorithms based on the frame-rate and scene-complexity. Since these decisions are made at run-time, and since a non-deterministic user may abruptly change the complexity of the scene simply by turning his or her head, the scheduler must be reactive, seeking feasible, rather than optimal solutions. This differs from other time-critical rendering techniques which pre-process the 3D model and construct data-structures to be used at run-time [1] [2] [9]. The run-time dynamics allow the rendering scheduler to orchestrate different degradation mechanisms, degrading for overloaded scenes, and for only a few objects, rather than for all objects over the entire period of the application. Degradation mechanisms include:
