Title: A Methodology for Behavioural Retrieval from Class Libraries  
Author: Steven Atkinson Roger Duke 
Keyword: class libraries, reuse, behavioural compatibility.  
Affiliation: Software Verification Research Centre Department of Computer Science University of Queensland  
Abstract: The central problem associated with libraries of reusable software components such as classes is that of retrieval: how to find in the library those classes that can be used in the construction of a particular application. At the heart of class retrieval is the issue of behaviour: to decide if a library class is appropriate for a particular application it is necessary to know how objects of that class behave, i.e. how they react when sent messages by their environment. In this paper a methodology for searching libraries to find classes whose objects behave in some specified manner is defined. In general, it will not be possible to find a class whose objects behave exactly as required. In this case the methodology finds classes whose objects best approximate the specified behaviour in a precisely defined sense. The aim is to retrieve classes that can be easily modified to define objects that behave exactly as required.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between instances of the abstract class model described in Section 2 and classes specified in object-oriented specification languages such as Object-Z <ref> [2] </ref> needs to be investigated, particularly to determine a method of deriving behaviour from formal specifications. The aim is to enable the methodology to be applied to a library of classes described by formal specifications.

Reference-contexts: The principle of behavioural retrieval from software libraries has been suggested by Podgurski and Pierce [9]; the idea of using a lattice structure as the basis of behavioural retrieval has been suggested by Mili <ref> [7] </ref>. In our paper we combine this work and extend it in three directions. Firstly, an abstract model of classes and class behaviour is defined, laying the foundation for a general theory of behavioural retrieval, independent of any particular language formalism.
