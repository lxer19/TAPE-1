Reference-contexts: This extension is unavailable on the InfoPad system since all graphics data must be transferred across the network before display. To run vic efficiently, we decided to transcode the video display data to the InfoPad VQ format. A video gateway (vgw) <ref> [AMZ95] </ref> that supports conversions in real time between H261, MJPEG and the InfoPad VQ formats is used to perform the transcoding. The vic also required minor modifications to uses this video gateway.

Reference-contexts: The video is stored at host A. Host B, which is near the InfoPad on the network, synchronizes the video with the audio. Pad FIGURE 6. InfoPad video controls 11 dictionary in order to obtain reasonable accuracy . Furthermore, with the advent of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) <ref> [BF93] </ref> capable mail readers, electronic mail may not necessarily be in ASCII but in forms such as electronic ink. Recognition is therefore not strictly necessary for email, although a cursive recognizer would ease the use of ASCII email.

Reference-contexts: These overlay networks are characterized by dif ferent coverage, bandwidth, latency, and bit-error rates. The Daedalus group is developing network management software and application support services to allow mobile computers to dynamically adapt to the state of their network connectivity. The problems being examined include: improving TCP performance <ref> [BSAK95] </ref>, supporting routing and handof f in heterogeneous networks, characterizing network performance, and supporting applications that are aware of the quality of their network connections and adapt to changes in this quality [Kat94].

Reference-contexts: This form of handoff has been implemented and measured in a similar system that uses conventional laptops as mobile devices. Handof fs take between 5 and 70ms to complete independent of the amount of data in ight <ref> [BSK95] </ref>. The frequency-hopped radios currently used by InfoPad limit the radio resource allocation needed and the quality of service support possible. We statically choose the appropriate hopping sequence for different cells to eliminate interference between users. Therefore, the cell server uses error coding alone to control available bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: The primary goal of the InfoPad project is to combine these trends to create a system that provides ubiquitous information access. The system is built around a low power , lightweight, wireless, multimedia terminal <ref> [CBB94] </ref> that operates in indoor environments and supports a high density of users. The InfoPad system uses a number of innovative techniques to provide the high bandwidth connectivity , portability, and user interface needed for this environment. <p> The hardware in the pad supports the operation of the wireless link, and the acquisition and display of multimedia data. The processing in the terminal is primarily performed by a set of application specif ic integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for low power dissipation <ref> [CBB94] </ref>. The embedded software on the pad currently executes on a combination of a low power processor (ARM 610) and special purpose programmable logic. This software initializes and controls the ASICs, implements wireless link level and reliable transport protocols, and monitors the quality of the wireless channel.

Reference-contexts: replaced by a newly designed 2 Mbps, 50 channel custom CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) radio [SCB92] and the uplink by a TDMA (T ime D iv ision Multiple A ccess) radio loo sely b ased o n th e D EC T (Digital E uropean C ordless Telecommunications) protocol <ref> [DEC92] </ref>. We approach the crucial problem of power consumption at the circuit, algorithmic and architectural levels. The custom ASICs on the pad use a low-power VLSI cell library designed to operate at 1.5 V olts rather than the usual 3.3 or 5 Volts found in most commercial systems.

Reference-contexts: Multicast provides a natural, low overhead mechanism to deliver the same packets to both the new and current gateways. Each type server transmits packets to an IP Multicast <ref> [Dee91] </ref> group. For each pad in the system there is a unique IP Multicast address. The gateway responsible for a pad joins the associated multicast channels and forwards any packets it receives across the wireless network.

Reference-contexts: The demand for portability is clearly demonstrated by the rapid growth in sales of equipment such as portable computers. The main limitation of current portable computers is short battery life. Unfortunately, battery technology is improving at the relatively slow rate of 30% every 5 years <ref> [Eag92] </ref> with no breakthrough technologies expected. The typical approach to improving battery life is to re-engineer chips and systems for lower voltage operation.

Conf. on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, </booktitle> <address> Atlanta, GA, </address> <month> May </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: MPEG is def icient in a fading and interference-limited wireless environment because it minimizes the bit rate without regard for the traf fic penalty of the high reliability requirements imposed thereby <ref> [HYM96] </ref>. We are therefore designing and implementing in future InfoPad prototypes coordinated video and graphics coding and transport systems that introduce a number of innovations beyond past ef forts.

Reference-contexts: For example, a modified X11R6 [SG91] server provides access to the pad s screen. Similarly, the audio server is built using AudioFile [LPG+93], the video server is built on top of the Continuous Media Toolkit [RPSL94] and the handwriting recognizer provides an interface based on a Sun Microsystems API <ref> [Kem93] </ref>. For some of the devices there are no established standards. These servers use custom interfaces that suit our needs.

Reference-contexts: Wide-area Overlay Networks Regional-Area Metropolitan-Area Campus-Area Packet Relay In-Building 23 [YM95], and delay and loss will be controlled using earliest-deadline scheduling of packets in the base station. In a coordinated innovation, we have proposed <ref> [LRM94, RYLM95] </ref> and will implement a new approach to asynchronous video coding that achieves joint source/channel coding in the delay as well as loss and corruption dimensions (by abandoning the conventional synchronous model of frame-by-frame video reconstruction).

Reference-contexts: Currently, the most popular conferencing tools on the Internet are the MBone utilities: vat (Visual Audio Tool), wb (White Board), and vic (Video Conference) <ref> [MBo95] </ref>. We felt it was important to provide special support for the use of these tools on the pad. Vat and wb run on our system as standard X11 and AudioFile applications. Unfortunately, vic performs very poorly as a standard X11 application on the pad.

Reference-contexts: Using this API, the application tells the recognizer which areas of the screen to monitor. To facilitate investigation of the role of handwriting in user interfaces, we have extended the Tk <ref> [Ous94] </ref> GUI toolkit with a pen input widget that transparently handles stroke data collection, digital ink display, cutting and pasting of stroke data, and interaction with one or more recognizer engines.
