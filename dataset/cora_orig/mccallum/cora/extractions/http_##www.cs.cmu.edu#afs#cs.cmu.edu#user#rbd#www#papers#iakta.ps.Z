Title: Music Understanding By Computer  
Author: Roger B. Dannenberg 
Address: Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA  
Affiliation: School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: Music Understanding refers to the recognition or identification of structure and pattern in musical information. Music understanding projects initiated by the author are discussed. In the first, Computer Accompaniment, the goal is to follow a performer in a score. Knowledge of the position in the score as a function of time can be used to synchronize an accompaniment to the live performer and automatically adjust to tempo variations. In the second project, it is shown that statistical methods can be used to recognize the location of an improviser in a cyclic chord progression such as the 12-bar blues. The third project, Beat Tracking, attempts to identify musical beats using note-onset times from a live performance. Parallel search techniques are used to consider several hypotheses simultaneously, and both timing and higher-level musical knowledge are integrated to evaluate the hypotheses. The fourth project, the Piano Tutor, identifies student performance errors and offers advice. The fifth project studies human tempo tracking with the goal of improving the naturalness of automated accompaniment systems.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, once the foot tapper gets off the beat, it is very difficult to lock back into synchronization. Paul Allen and I used a more elaborate approach to overcome this problem of losing synchronization. <ref> [Allen 90] </ref> Our observation was that simpler foot tappers often came to a situation where the interpretation of a note onset was ambiguous.

Reference-contexts: Note that the computer performs a pre-composed part, so there is no real-time composition involved but rather a responsive synchronization. Several computer accompaniment systems have been implemented by the author and his colleagues [Dannenberg 84, Bloch 85, Dannenberg 88]. These differ from the accompaniment systems of others <ref> [Vercoe 85, Lifton 85, Baird 93] </ref> primarily in the algorithms used for score following. Only the score following component developed by the author will be described here. Score following can be considered to have two subtasks as shown in Figure 1. 3 2.1.

This work was performed with Joshua Bloch <ref> [Bloch 85] </ref> and the reader is referred to our paper for further details. The Matcher performs a fairly low-level recognition task where efficiency is important and relatively little knowledge is required.

Reference-contexts: The Piano Tutor maintains a student model which reflects the skills that the student is believed to possess. The student model is used to find lessons that the student is prepared to take, and the model is updated as the student masters lessons. This approach <ref> [Capell 93] </ref> turns out to have little to do specifically with music, and we are starting to build a tutoring system for Computer Science using the same representation and lesson selection mechanism. 11 6.

Dr. Mont-Reynaud designed the beat follower or ``foot tapper'', and I designed the harmonic analysis software.

(Since only the relative likelihood is of interest, the computed values are not normalized to obtain true probabilities, and the plotted values are the direct result of integer computations. See <ref> [Dannenberg 87] </ref> for details.) Both the graph and the 12-bar blues form are periodic with a period of 96 eighth notes. Slightly more than one period is plotted so that the peak at zero is repeated around 96.

Reference-contexts: Learning and classification techniques might be used here. Another promising direction is to use harmonic or other information to help rate various interpretations. 5. The Piano Tutor The projects described above concern basic music listening skills. In the Piano Tutor project <ref> [Dannenberg 90] </ref>, we attempted to capture the knowledge and skills of a piano teacher, a problem that is in some ways much more difficult, but in other ways actually simpler.

Reference-contexts: The fifth skill concerns music synchronization: How is it that performers adjust their tempo or score position to synchronize with another player? The first part of this paper is taken almost verbatim from an earlier report <ref> [Dannenberg 91a] </ref>. That report is extended here with current information. It should be noted that this paper focuses almost entirely on work by the author with various students and colleagues. It should not be interpreted as a survey of the state of the art.

Reference-contexts: When matches are found, they are output for use by an Accompaniment Performance subtask, which uses knowledge about musical performance to control a synthesizer. Several systems have been implemented based on these techniques, and the results are quite good. <ref> [Dannenberg 91b] </ref> The matcher has been extended to handle trills, glissandi, and grace notes as special cases that would otherwise cause problems [Dannenberg 88], and this version has been used successfully for several concerts. <p> The tempo estimation software tends to start reliably but eventually loses synchronization with the performance unless the performance is very precise. The ``correlation'' software can locate the beginning of the blues form only when the performance is very obvious in outlining the harmonic structure. <ref> [Dannenberg 91b] </ref> When the harmonic structure is not so obviously outlined, the correlation peaks are not so distinct. The peaks become sharper as more measures of input are analyzed, but requiring many measures of input makes the technique unsuited to real-time performances.

Reference-contexts: One of the interesting elements of interaction in the Piano Tutor is the sort of ``conversation'' that develops between teacher and student. <ref> [Dannenberg 92] </ref> This is not a natural language dialog, but it is nevertheless a two-way interaction. The student communicates to the computer teacher by performing specified tasks. The machine responds with multimedia presentations, most often pre-recorded voice and highlighted notes in the graphical music display.

Reference-contexts: To be specific, we asked human accompanists to follow machine-sequenced music which we carefully altered in order to study how humans respond to tempo changes and other timing deviations. Thus far, we have conducted only a pilot study <ref> [Mecca 93] </ref>, so there is much more work to be done, but even the preliminary results are quite interesting. Five experiments were conducted: Playing scales. This experiment characterized the accuracy with which humans could play along with a steady stream of quarter notes. Catching up.

Reference-contexts: The matcher described here overcomes this problem and works well in practice. The matcher is derived from the dynamic programming algorithm for finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings <ref> [Sankoff 83] </ref>. Imagine starting with two strings and eliminating arbitrary characters from each string until the the remaining characters (subsequences) match exactly. If these strings represent the performance and score, respectively, then a common subsequence represents a potential correspondence between performed notes and the score (see Figure 2).
