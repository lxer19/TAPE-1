Abstract: Many designs for integrated service networks offer a bounded delay packet delivery service to support real-time applications. To provide bounded delay service, networks must use admission control to regulate their load. Previous work on admission control mainly focused on algorithms that compute the worst case theoretical queueing delay to guarantee an absolute delay bound for all packets. In this paper we describe a measurement-based admission control algorithm for predictive service, which allows occasional delay violations. We have tested our algorithm through simulations on a wide variety of network topologies and driven with various source models, including some that exhibit long-range dependence, both in themselves and in their aggregation. Our simulation results suggest that, at least for the scenarios studied here, the measurement-based approach combined with the relaxed service commitment of predictive service enables us to achieve a high level of network utilization while still reliably meeting the delay bound.

Reference-contexts: The fARIMA model takes three parameters, the autoregressive process order with the corresponding set of weights, the degree of integration, and the moving average process order with the corresponding set of weights, it also requires an innovation with a Gaussian marginal distribution (see <ref> [BJ76, Hos84] </ref> for details). We first generate a normally distributed innovation with mean N and standard deviation s packets. If the minimum of the fARIMA output is less than zero, we shift the whole series by adding the absolute value of its minimum to every number in the series.

Reference-contexts: In our scheme, the admission control algorithm at each switch enforces the queueing delay bound at that switch. We leave the satisfaction of end-to-end delay requirements to the end systems. An end system could, for example, use adaptive source routing, such as the one in <ref> [Bre95] </ref>, to select a route that satisfies its end-to-end requirements. We also assume the existence of a reservation protocol, such as the one in [Z + 93], which the end systems could use to communicate their resource requirements to the network.

Reference-contexts: 1 Bounded Delay Services and Predictive Service There have been many proposals for supporting real-time applications in packet networks; see [OON88, FV90, GAN91] for a few representative examples. Most of these proposals provide some form of bounded delay packet delivery service. The CSZ proposal <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> introduced predictive service which is designed to achieve higher utilizations than more traditional bounded delay services by allowing occasional delay bound violations. The ability of bounded delay services to achieve high utilizations and also meet their service commitments depends crucially on the admission control algorithm. <p> Many real-time applications, such as vat, nv, and vic, have recently been developed for packet-switched networks. These applications adapt to actual packet delays and are thus rather tolerant of occasional delay bound violations; they do not need an absolutely reliable bound. For these tolerant applications, references <ref> [CSZ92, SCZ95] </ref> proposed predictive service, which offers a fairly, but not absolutely, reliable bound on packet delivery times. It is important to note that the service definition itself does not specify the acceptable level of delay violations. This is for two reasons. <p> This can't possibly be predicted in advance with any degree of accuracy. For this reason, we think that measurement based admission control will play a key role in achieving high network utilizations. The measurement based admission control approach advocated in <ref> [CSZ92, JSZC92] </ref> uses the a priori source characterizations only for incoming flows (and those very recently admitted); it uses measurements to characterize those flows that have been in place for a reasonable duration. Therefore, network utilization does not suffer significantly if the traffic descriptions are not tight. <p> The authors of [DKPS95] have also replicated some of our results on their independently developed network simulator. 1.1 Implementation and Use of Predictive Service We now describe the implementation of predictive service in more detail. In <ref> [CSZ92] </ref>, the authors described an unified scheduling algorithm for providing both guaranteed and predictive services. Guaranteed service is provided with the weighted fair queueing (WFQ) scheduling discipline described in [DKS89, Par92]. Predictive service is provided with the priority queueing discipline. <p> We also assume the existence of a reservation protocol, such as the one in [Z + 93], which the end systems could use to communicate their resource requirements to the network. Sources requesting service must characterize the worst-case behavior of their flow. In <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> this characterization is done with a token bucket filter. A token bucket filter for a flow has two parameters: its token generation rate, r, and the depth of its bucket, b, i.e. no more than b tokens can be accumulated.

Typically, sources are described by either peak and average rates <ref> [FV90] </ref> or a filter like a token bucket [OON88]; these descriptions provide upper bounds on the traffic that can be generated by the source. <p> Calculating the worst-case delays may be very complex, but the underlying admission control principle is conceptually simple: does granting a new request for service cause the worst-case behavior of the network to violate any delay bound? (See <ref> [FV90] </ref> for an example of this approach.) Network utilization under this model is usually acceptable when flows are smooth; when flows are bursty, however, their traffic characterizations necessarily must be quite loose, in that the average behavior of the flows is significantly less than the upper bound of the traffic descriptions,

Reference-contexts: Each fARIMA source then picks an uniformly distributed number between 1 and 15,000 to be used as its index into that series. On reaching the end of the series, the source wraps around to the beginning. This method is similar to the one used by the authors of <ref> [GW94] </ref> to simulate data from several sources using one variable bit rate (VBR) video trace. The fractional ARIMA model generates long-range dependent series. <p> The fractional ARIMA model generates long-range dependent series. However, the marginal distribution of fARIMA generated series is Gaussian, whereas VBR video traces exhibit low average with high peaks; thus we can not use the fARIMA output to model traffic from a single VBR video source. Nevertheless, simulation results in <ref> [GW94] </ref> indicated that aggregate of fARIMA generated series may well model aggregate VBR video trafficsuch as that coming from a subnetwork.

Reference-contexts: The fARIMA model takes three parameters, the autoregressive process order with the corresponding set of weights, the degree of integration, and the moving average process order with the corresponding set of weights, it also requires an innovation with a Gaussian marginal distribution (see <ref> [BJ76, Hos84] </ref> for details). We first generate a normally distributed innovation with mean N and standard deviation s packets. If the minimum of the fARIMA output is less than zero, we shift the whole series by adding the absolute value of its minimum to every number in the series.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that the service definition itself does not specify the acceptable level of delay violations. This is for two reasons. First, it is not particularly meaningful to specify a failure rate to a flow with a short duration <ref> [NK92] </ref>. Second, reliably ensuring that the failure rate never exceeds a particular level leads to the same worst-case calculations that predictive service was designed to avoid.

Reference-contexts: 1 Bounded Delay Services and Predictive Service There have been many proposals for supporting real-time applications in packet networks; see <ref> [OON88, FV90, GAN91] </ref> for a few representative examples. Most of these proposals provide some form of bounded delay packet delivery service. The CSZ proposal [CSZ92] introduced predictive service which is designed to achieve higher utilizations than more traditional bounded delay services by allowing occasional delay bound violations. <p> When a flow requests real-time service, it must characterize its traffic so that the network can make its admission control decision. Typically, sources are described by either peak and average rates [FV90] or a filter like a token bucket <ref> [OON88] </ref>; these descriptions provide upper bounds on the traffic that can be generated by the source. Traditional approaches to admission control, like those used for guaranteed service, use the a priori characterizations of sources to calculate the worst-case behavior of all the existing flows in addition to the incoming one. <p> The possibility of using ongoing measurements of load in making admission decisions was suggested, but not fully developed nor explored, in <ref> [OON88, GAN91, AS94] </ref>. Several recent papers, such as [SS91, Hir91, CLG95] presented measurement-based admission control algorithms. <p> The Whittle maximum likelihood estimator [Ber94] confirms that our shifting, cropping, and overlaying of the fARIMA generated series does not destroy its long-range dependence. To ease discussion on the effect of different source models on traffic characteristics, it is useful to define the following additional concepts <ref> [OON88] </ref>: is a source's density (the ratio of its average to peak rate, a=p), R a source's grain size (the ratio of its peak rate to link bandwidth, p=). The burstiness of a source is measured by 1=.

Reference-contexts: In [CSZ92], the authors described an unified scheduling algorithm for providing both guaranteed and predictive services. Guaranteed service is provided with the weighted fair queueing (WFQ) scheduling discipline described in <ref> [DKS89, Par92] </ref>. Predictive service is provided with the priority queueing discipline. The priority queue providing predictive service consists of several levels of priority and is served by the bandwidth left over from serving guaranteed service. <p> Cruz, in [Cru91], derived a tight bound for the worst-case delay, D fl j , of priority queue level j. Our derivation follows Parekh's <ref> [Par92] </ref>, which is a simpler, but looser, bound for D fl j that assumes small packet sizes, i.e. the transmission time of each packet is sufficiently small (as compared to other delays) and hence can be ignored. <p> This assumption of small packet sizes further allows us to ignore delays caused by the lack of preemption. Further, we assume that the aggregate rate, aggregated over all traffic classes, is within the link capacity ( P Theorem 1 Parekh <ref> [Par92] </ref>: The worst-case class j delay, with FIFO discipline within the class and assuming infinite peak rates for the sources, is D fl P j i=1 r i for each class j. <p> a new flow ff of predictive class k by changing the class's token bucket parameters to (-k + r ff k ), where (r ff k ; b ff k ) are the token bucket parameters of 3 For a proof of Theorem 1, we refer the interested readers to <ref> [Par92] </ref> or [Jam95]. the new flow: D fl 0 P k1 -G i=1 i b k + b ff -G i=1 i k + k P k1 : (2) We see that the delay of class k grows by a term that is proportional to flow ff's bucket size. 2. <p> A higher priority predictive flow not only squeezes the pipe available to lower priority traffic, but also pre empts it. We have observed this phenomenon predicted by the analytical models in our simulations. 2.2 Worst-case Delay: Guaranteed Service In reference <ref> [Par92] </ref>, Parekh proved that in a network with arbitrary topology, the WFQ scheduling discipline provides guaranteed delay bounds that depend only on flows' reserved rates and bucket depths. Under WFQ, each guaranteed flow is isolated from the others. <p> When a flow with token bucket parameters (r; b) requests guaranteed service, the maximal queueing delay (ignoring terms proportional to a single packet time) is given by b=r <ref> [Par92] </ref>. Column 11, labeled D j , lists the predictive delay bound assigned to each source. We simulate only two classes of predictive service. A predictive bound of 16 msecs. means first class predictive service, 160 msecs. second class.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies ([LTWW94, DMRW94, PF94, KM94, GW94, BSTW95]) have shown that network traffic often exhibits long-range dependence (LRD), with the implications that congested periods can be quite long and a slight increase in number of active connections can result in large increase in packet loss rate. Reference <ref> [PF94] </ref> further called attention to the effect long-range dependent traffic might have on the feasibility of measurement-based admission control. To investigate this and other LRD related questions, we augmented our simulation study with two LRD source models. EXP Model. <p> The Pareto location parameter is N fl (fi 1)=fi. The OFF times are exponentially distributed with average I milliseconds. Each Pareto-ON/OFF source by itself does not generate LRD series. However, the aggregation of them (of degree greater than 10 [Wil95]) does <ref> [LTWW94, PF94, KM94] </ref>. LRD: Fractional ARIMA. We use each number generated by the fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) process ([HR89]) as the number of fixed-size packets to be sent back to back in the next ON period. Interarrival of ON periods are of fixed length. <p> We use exponentially distributed CHT for the EXP model, following [Mol27]. The CHTs for the LRD models, however, are taken from a lognormal distribution, following [Bol94, DMRW94]. The interarrival times of all flows are exponentially distributed <ref> [PF94] </ref>. 5 4.3 Parameter Choices We chose six instantiations of the above three source models, as summarized in Table 1. In the table, p = 1 means that after each OFF time, packets for the next ON period are transmitted back to back.

Reference-contexts: Many real-time applications, such as vat, nv, and vic, have recently been developed for packet-switched networks. These applications adapt to actual packet delays and are thus rather tolerant of occasional delay bound violations; they do not need an absolutely reliable bound. For these tolerant applications, references <ref> [CSZ92, SCZ95] </ref> proposed predictive service, which offers a fairly, but not absolutely, reliable bound on packet delivery times. It is important to note that the service definition itself does not specify the acceptable level of delay violations. This is for two reasons.

Reference-contexts: In such an approach, each flow is allotted an effective bandwidth that is larger than its average rate but less than its peak rate; network utilization is thus increased. In most cases the a priori characterization of flows is based on a statistical model <ref> [Hui88, SS91] </ref> or on a fluid flow approximation [GAN91, Kel91]). 2 We think it will be quite difficult, if not impossible, to provide accurate and tight statistical models for each individual flow. Therefore the a priori traffic characterizations handed to admission control will inevitably be fairly loose upper bounds. <p> The possibility of using ongoing measurements of load in making admission decisions was suggested, but not fully developed nor explored, in [OON88, GAN91, AS94]. Several recent papers, such as <ref> [SS91, Hir91, CLG95] </ref> presented measurement-based admission control algorithms. In general, these references do not report extensive simulations of their approaches; in addition, the authors of [AS94, GAN91, SS91] assume certain stationary bit rate distributions and use measurements to obtain the parameters of the distributions. <p> Several recent papers, such as [SS91, Hir91, CLG95] presented measurement-based admission control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: An end system could, for example, use adaptive source routing, such as the one in [Bre95], to select a route that satisfies its end-to-end requirements. We also assume the existence of a reservation protocol, such as the one in <ref> [Z + 93] </ref>, which the end systems could use to communicate their resource requirements to the network. Sources requesting service must characterize the worst-case behavior of their flow. In [CSZ92] this characterization is done with a token bucket filter.

Reference-contexts: under this model is usually acceptable when flows are smooth; when flows are bursty, however, their traffic characterizations necessarily must be quite loose, in that the average behavior of the flows is significantly less than the upper bound of the traffic descriptions, and guaranteed service inevitably results in low utilization <ref> [ZF94] </ref>.
