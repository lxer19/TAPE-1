Reference-contexts: In this paper, we extend the study of d (G) to graphs embeddable on the torus, and surfaces of higher genera. 1.1 Previous Work Defective coloring was introduced almost simultaneously by Burr and Jacobson (see <ref> [1] </ref>), Harary and Jones [11] and Cowen, Cowen and Woodall [5], and has continued to be an active area of research. Surveys of this and related colorings are given in [8] and [16]. <p> Corollary 1.2 d (G) + 1 d + 1 + 1: - 2 - The papers <ref> [1, 8, 9] </ref> provide other bounds on the defective chromatic number in terms of other parameters and in terms of other defective chromatic numbers. The complexity of constructing defective colorings is less well-studied. However, R. Cowen [7] showed that (2; 1)-coloring is NP-Complete for general graphs.

Reference-contexts: For general surfaces, it was shown in [5] that for each genus g 0, there exists a k = k (g) such that every graph on the surface of genus g is (4; k)-colorable. This was improved to (3; k)-colorable by Archdeacon <ref> [2] </ref>. For general graphs, a result of Lovasz from the 1960s [13], which has been rediscovered many times since (cf. [3, 4, 12, 16]), provides an upper bound on the defective chromatic number of a graph. <p> Second, we consider defective colorings of graphs on arbitrary surfaces. For genus fl, let d (fl) be the maximum d-defect coloring number of all graphs embeddable on the surface S fl . We show that d (fl) 0 (fl)=(d + 1) + 4. Also, Archdeacon <ref> [2] </ref> showed that every graph embeddable on the surface S fl is (3; 3fl +O (1))-colorable. <p> The above theorem shows that the number of colors needed is only a few more than those needed for the maximum clique on that surface. For fixed number of colors, namely 3, Archdeacon <ref> [2] </ref> showed that a graph is approximately (3; 3fl)-colorable. The next theorem shows that this is improveable to (3; c p fl)-colorable, which shows that the maximum defect needed for 3-colorability is within a constant factor of that needed for the maximum clique on that surface.

Reference-contexts: So a (k; 0)-coloring is a proper coloring, and 0 (G) is the usual vertex chromatic number of the graph. The parameter d (G), also called the defective chromatic number of G, has been well-studied for planar graphs (see, for example, <ref> [5, 8, 10, 14, 16] </ref>). <p> In this paper, we extend the study of d (G) to graphs embeddable on the torus, and surfaces of higher genera. 1.1 Previous Work Defective coloring was introduced almost simultaneously by Burr and Jacobson (see [1]), Harary and Jones [11] and Cowen, Cowen and Woodall <ref> [5] </ref>, and has continued to be an active area of research.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of constructing defective colorings is less well-studied. However, R. Cowen [7] showed that (2; 1)-coloring is NP-Complete for general graphs. Recently, <ref> [6] </ref> extended this, showing that determining if a graph is (2; 1)-colorable is NP-complete for planar graphs, and this generalizes to (2; d)-coloring for d 1, and also showed that determining if a planar graph is (3; 1)-colorable is also NP-Complete. <p> In general graph (k; d)-coloring is NP-Complete for all k 3, and all d 0, as expected, and <ref> [6] </ref> go on to generalize approximate coloring algorithms to defects. 1.2 This paper In this paper, we first extend the results on the plane to the torus. First, we show that any graph embeddable on the torus is (3; 2)-colorable.
