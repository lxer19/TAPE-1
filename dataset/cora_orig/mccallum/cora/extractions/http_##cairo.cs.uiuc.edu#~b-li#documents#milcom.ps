Title: Synchronized End-to-End Multicast in Real-Time Packet Cellular Networks  
Author: Dongyan Xu and Baochun Li 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Abstract: In this paper we present and evaluate protocols (SMP and SMP-MH) for synchronized end-to-end mul-ticast in real-time packet cellular networks. Our protocols extend current delay jitter control mechanisms to achieve synchronized real-time packet delivery to mobile hosts in multiple cells. We show that for a mul-ticast session using SMP and SMP-MH: (1) the end-to-end delay bounds of each packet to the subscribing mobile hosts are identical, with small and bounded jitters, and (2) a mobile host can experience smooth, brief, and lossless handoffs, and thus receive seamless Quality of Service (QoS).
