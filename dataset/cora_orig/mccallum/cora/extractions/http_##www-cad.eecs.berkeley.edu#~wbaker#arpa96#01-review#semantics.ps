Abstract: The central issue in the semantics of these sorts of systems is the definition of a computation within step, whether that be a clock cycle or some other more abstract temporal unit. A language semantics which exposes the aspects of coordination and concurrency within a step is called a nonabstract semantics whereas a semantics which hides such intra-step details is called a fully abstract semantics. The semantic theory is constructed by making a very detailed examination of the topological structure of time within a cycle and produces a condition of substitutability when a nonabstract semantics can be projected down to the fully abstract case. Such a result is useful for it explains when a cycle-level abstraction of an HDL specification always exists. This leads to two important results:
