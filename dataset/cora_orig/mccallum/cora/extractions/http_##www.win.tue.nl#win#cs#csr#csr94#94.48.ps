Title: Fixed-Point Calculus Mathematics of Program Construction Group  
Date: October 14, 1994  
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a small calculus of extreme fixed points and to show it in action. The fixed-point theorem that was the main incentive for writing this paper is the fusion theorem presented in Section (3). It exploits the calculational properties of Galois connections.

Reference-contexts: This example was inspired by Augusteijn [2]. The transformation given here is a special case of a more general transformation of a recursive-descent algorithm into a recursive-ascent algorithm. For more on relational calculus |and Galois connections| see Aarts et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. 7 Epilogue We have found it encouraging to experience how a small calculus like the one presented here can have a variety of applications (although inevitably it also has its limitations).

Reference-contexts: The latter is quite a different recursive definition of factorial from (24). This example was inspired by Augusteijn <ref> [2] </ref>. The transformation given here is a special case of a more general transformation of a recursive-descent algorithm into a recursive-ascent algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This is the rule we call the Unique Extension Property (UEP) of Regular Algebra. It was first mentioned in <ref> [3] </ref>. In view of (17), the UEP can be formulated as (23) [UEP of regular algebra] If hx 7! x bi = 0, then for all a and x a + x b = x j x = a bfl .
