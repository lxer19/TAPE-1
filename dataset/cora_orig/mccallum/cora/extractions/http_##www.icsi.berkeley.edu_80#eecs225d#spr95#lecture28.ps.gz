Abstract: Sid Fells described the operation and utility of the Glove-TalkII system. Glove-TalkII is a gesture-to-speech device. An operator would generate input to a speech synthesizer by motions of his hands. Adaptive neural networks learn the gestures of an operator and convert the operator's hand motions to speech parameters. A formant-based speech synthesizer takes the parameters and generates the speech in real-time. Neural networks are used because they are adept at finding mappings between inputs and outputs. Since there would be a great deal of variation between the gestures of different operators and even the same operator, the neural network would need to adapt. An adaptive interface is useful for high-bandwidth devices. The idea behind the gesture-to-speech device is to model an artificial vocal tract with a different part of the body. This would be useful for someone who did not have use of his/her vocal tract.
