Reference-contexts: Stochastic resonance is said to occur when, for some noise levels, the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the output unit can be higher than in the input. Stochastic resonance was first reported in the context of periodic variations of the climate of the earth <ref> (Benzi, Sutera, & Vulpiani, 1981) </ref>. In a later study, it was suggested that neural processing might employ such a mechanism to improve performance (Longtin, Bulsara, & Moss, 1991).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, its synchronous, or resonant, neural states have been proposed to initiate synaptic learning on a slower time scale (Carpenter & Grossberg, 1993; Grossberg, 1976, 1980) that is consistent with known properties of long-term potentiation or LTP <ref> (Bliss & Collingridge, 1993) </ref>. Perceptual framing may thus be utilized not only for perception, but also for learning about the visual environment.

Reference-contexts: The reaction time paradigm has been used to study the dependence of reaction time on the contrast of a flash of light, and it was found that the reaction time decreases with increasing contrast <ref> (Burkhardt, Gottesman, & Keenan, 1987) </ref>, even if the energy of the flash is kept constant, provided the flash is not too close to threshold, in which case Bloch's law holds.

Reference-contexts: In many such models, the phase of the oscilla March 11, 1996 5 tion is taken to encode all the features that belong within a single object. Some models also require that attention be focused upon an object or object part before it can synchronously oscillate <ref> (Crick & Koch, 1990) </ref>. It is hard to understand, however, how an object's phase can remain constant as its image size and position on the retina change radically, while the same is happening to other objects, due to changes in their distances and angles with respect to an observer.

Solid line: internal time difference in the presence of noise. Dashed line: internal time difference in the absence of noise. A simulation showing how the network maintains, and can even improve, its synchronization in noise is shown in Figure 8.

Reference-contexts: No synchronization occurred if two separate bars were swept through both receptive fields simultaneously in opposite directions. Similar results were also found in the awake monkey (Kreiter & Singer, 1992). Synchronization has been shown to occur across wide cortical distances (Gray et al., 1989), and even across hemispheres <ref> (Engel, Konig, Kreiter, & Singer, 1991) </ref>. Initially it was postulated that synchronization occurs between oscillating cell sites (Gray & Singer, 1989), a claim that has been controversial (Ghose & Freeman, 1992; Young, Tanaka, & Yamane, 1992).

Reference-contexts: that at about 20ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) subjects begin to obtain a reliable representation of the temporal order of two brief stimuli (Hirsch & Sherrick, 1961). * Spatial pooling effects lead to a reduction of the contrast threshold as the length of stimuli is increased up to 2.5 degrees <ref> (Essock, 1990) </ref>. * Stochastic resonance can improve performance in the presence of noise at small levels of noise. This improvement manifests itself in an enhanced signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the output compared to that in the input (McNamara & Wiesenfeld, 1989). * Synchronization also occurs in the presence of intercellular competition. <p> Along with this argument goes that finding that the receptive field sizes of simple and complex cells (Hubel & Wiesel, 1968) are in line with the dimensions used in some psychophysical studies (Bacon & King-Smith, 1977; Thomas, 1978). Other studies have used gratings that are substantially longer <ref> (Essock, 1990) </ref>. Here, an effect of spatial pooling was observed which asymptoted only after the stimulus length reached 2.5 degrees. <p> In the threshold-contrast simulations, the presentation time was kept constant (20 ms), and the input strength was varied. The threshold input was the lowest value (up to 0.01) that led to oscillations. Inputs below threshold led to non-oscillatory activities. Normalization was done for comparison with psychophysical data <ref> (Essock, 1990) </ref>. Both simulation results and psychophysical data were normalized. Normalization was performed by dividing the input size by the value of that size at which no further threshold reduction occurred (i.e., the asymptotic value). The contrast was normalized in a similar way. The result is shown in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: It has also been shown that synchronization cannot be mediated by a clocking mechanism such as the cortical alpha-rhythm <ref> (Gho & Varela, 1989) </ref>, because triggering stimuli in a temporal order judgment task (see Section 2.1) to the alpha rhythm did not affect performance. Here we model how synchronization of distributed cortical activities by recurrent cooperative-competitive interactions that can temporally realign out-of-phase image parts.

Reference-contexts: This length is significantly bigger than the receptive fields size of simple and complex cells in monkey (Hubel & Wiesel, 1968), and hence speaks in favor of a process involving oriented interactions between cortical neurons. Such interactions may be mediated by horizontal connections within cortical area V1 <ref> (Gilbert, 1993) </ref> or V2 (von der Heydt et al., March 11, 1996 14 two stimuli, and the ordinate gives the resulting time difference (in simulated ms) between peaks of activity in the internal representations of the two stimuli.

Reference-contexts: Similarly the reaction time depends on the wavelength of the stimulus (Ueno, Pokorny, & Smith, 1985) and the spatial frequency <ref> (Gish, Shulman, Sheehy, & Leibowitz, 1986) </ref>. Such RT studies show that changing the stimulus along a feature dimension may change the rate of processing.

Reference-contexts: Competition is well-known to be an essential component of visual processing (Ku*er, 1953; Ratliff, 1965). Competition tends to sharpen, or contrast-enhance, activities across a neural representation, while normalizing the network's total activity and preventing saturation of cell activities in response to variable inputs <ref> (Grossberg, 1973) </ref>. Figure 9 shows how competition could occur within the model between two oscillators coding different orientations at the same location.

Reference-contexts: This process leads to rapidly synchronized cortical activities that define a perceptual frame in which object percepts may be elaborated. The cooperative bipole interactions that comprise the model's main synchronization mechanism were predicted to exist in visual cortex in Cohen and Grossberg (1984) and <ref> (Grossberg, 1984) </ref> and were reported in cortical area V2 by von der Heydt et al. (1984). The first BCS computer simulations of boundary segmentation used V2 model bipole cells to simulate the long-range interactions that help to form illusory contours (Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985a, 1985b).

Reference-contexts: The ratio R = D 2 =D 1 indicates the strength of competition. The same parameters as before were used, and R was varied between 0 and 1. In the simulations shown in Figure 10, R = 1=9. Larger values of R lead to a decrease of oscillator frequency <ref> (Grossberg & Grunewald, 1993) </ref>. March 11, 1996 22 The network model is made up of 128 coupled differential equations when there is no competition, and 256 when there is competition. Such a large system can exhibit very complex dynamics.

Reference-contexts: Here, key properties of framing are attributed to interactions of long-range cooperative cells that are called bipole cells. Although we simulate this model in a parameter range where oscillations occur, segmentation can also occur using the present type of model in parameter ranges where oscillations do not occur <ref> (Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985a, 1985b) </ref>.

Bottom-up convergence of signals in visual cortex does not suffice as a mechanism for synchronization, if only because cortical cells have a fast rate of integration <ref> (Mason, Nicoll, & Stratford, 1991) </ref>, yet the responses of cortical cells within the first 5ms after response onset is a 95% accurate predictor of the entire response strength (Celebrini, Thorpe, Trotter, & Imbert, 1993; Oram & Perrett, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Several neurophysiological studies addressed this issue and concluded that the standard deviation of response onset latencies in the visual cortex is just 10 ms (Celebrini et al., 1993; Maunsell & Gibson, 1992; Vogels & Orban, 1991). A careful analysis of the response onset latencies <ref> (Maunsell & Gibson, 1992) </ref> by cortical layer showed that the standard deviation is as small as 6ms. These data suggest that, contrary to the expected increase in variability, a decrease is taking place.

Reference-contexts: Similarly the reaction time depends on the wavelength of the stimulus <ref> (Ueno, Pokorny, & Smith, 1985) </ref> and the spatial frequency (Gish, Shulman, Sheehy, & Leibowitz, 1986). Such RT studies show that changing the stimulus along a feature dimension may change the rate of processing.

Reference-contexts: In summary, RT studies and TOJs do not yield the same results about relative rates of processing. It has been shown that the motor component of RT is not independent of stimulus properties <ref> (Ulrich & Stapf, 1984) </ref>. Thus it is possible that the dependence of motor reaction time on the visual stimulus may corrupt RT times too much for them to be a useful tool in the present context. For this reason, TOJ results are preferable over RT results as an explanatory target.

Reference-contexts: This problem is illustrated in Figure 1. Under extreme conditions, such as the rapid presentation of visual stimuli, it can happen that illusory conjunctions do occur (Intraub, 1985). Perceptual framing is the process whereby the parts of an image are resynchronized <ref> (Varela, Toro, John, & Schwartz, 1981) </ref>. In the present study, a neural network model is presented that exhibits perceptual framing, so that inputs to the network are resynchronized if they are temporally offset by less than a critical delay. <p> the same result: Temporal processing of visual information can be variable, due to different rates of processing for different stimulus features, yet when several features belonging to the same object are presented simultaneously, that variability is reduced, except in extreme circumstances such as RSVP, through a process of perceptual framing <ref> (Varela et al., 1981) </ref>. The data suggest that perceptual framing occurs only in the presence of several stimuli within the visual field.
