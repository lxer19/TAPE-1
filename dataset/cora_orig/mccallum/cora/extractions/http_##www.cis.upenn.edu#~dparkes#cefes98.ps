Abstract: We present a new investment group model for the portfolio selection problem. Members of the group adjust their portfolio as they observe movements of the market over time and communicate to each other their current portfolio and its recent performance. Investors can choose to switch to any portfolio performing better than their own. We show that a group of adaptive investors will outperform a single adaptive investor for a simple market model. Furthermore, a group of investors can improve their performance through communication. Finally we show that communication is redundant in an extended market model that includes efficiency-constraints on correlations between stock price dynamics.

Reference-contexts: The optimal portfolio strat-egy will depend on the risk-preferences of the investor. Non-linear programming techniques can be used to solve this optimization problem for a restricted class of utility functions, given a statistical model for the future dynamics of the stock market <ref> (Bertsekas, 1987) </ref>. Modern portfolio theory introduced approximate "mean-variance analysis", to simplify the portfolio selection problem (Markowitz, 1959).

Reference-contexts: The model satisfies the "Efficient Market Hypothesis", that states that an informationally efficient market has random price changes <ref> (Campbell et al., 1997) </ref>. 3 A constant rebalanced portfolio maintains the same proportion of wealth invested in each stock across all periods by selling stocks that outperform the market, and buying stocks that under-perform the market. <p> For example, the mean monthly return on stock in IBM between 1962 and 1994 was 1.0081, and the standard deviation in monthly return was 0.062 <ref> (Campbell et al., 1997, Page 21) </ref>. 8 This distribution of learning rates was found experimentally to give good performance of a wide range of investment group sizes, and helps to maintain a diversity of strategies within the investment group.

Reference-contexts: The parameter estimation problem for an economic random-variable is difficult in general (Borch, 1968; Campbell et al., 1997). 2.1 A Model-free Strategy for Portfolio Selection A recent game-theoretic approach to portfolio-selection makes no statistical assumptions about the underlying stock prices, and therefore "sidesteps" the parameter estimation problem <ref> (Cover, 1991) </ref>. A new algorithm, Exponentiated Gradient (EG) (Helmbold et al., 1996), presents a rule with which an adaptive investor can dynamically update her portfolio from period-to-period, without forming an explicit statistical model of the market.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we introduce a new investment group model that builds on a recent computationally-efficient algorithm for portfolio selection that has a worst-case performance guarantee <ref> (Helmbold et al., 1996) </ref>. We present a quantitative assessment of the performance of our model in simulated stochastic markets.

Reference-contexts: These results are applicable to economic approaches to hard computational problems, where it has been shown that a suitable portfolio of heuristics can improve the performance of programs for solving very hard problems <ref> (Huberman et al., 1997) </ref>. If individual processes choosing among possible heuristics are allowed to communicate, the final portfolio to which they converge will have the same optimal characteristics as the one we considered in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Portfolios are an effective way of increasing returns while decreasing risk when investing in the stock market <ref> (Markowitz, 1959) </ref>. For this reason there has been considerable attention to portfolio selection strategies in the financial (Campbell et al., 1997; Cover, 1991) and statistics (Samuelson, 1969; Cover and Gluss, 1986; Algoet and Cover, 1988) literature. <p> Non-linear programming techniques can be used to solve this optimization problem for a restricted class of utility functions, given a statistical model for the future dynamics of the stock market (Bertsekas, 1987). Modern portfolio theory introduced approximate "mean-variance analysis", to simplify the portfolio selection problem <ref> (Markowitz, 1959) </ref>. The "risk" of a portfolio is quantified as the standard deviation of return from period to period, and the portfolio selection problem is reduced to computing an "efficient" portfolio that minimizes risk for a given return.

Reference-contexts: An equivalent utility-theoretic interpretation for this performance measure is the expected final-period utility of an investor with a logarith mic utility function over return-on-investment, U (R) = log (R) <ref> (Parkes and Huberman, 1998) </ref>. As with other studies we ignore all transaction costs. 3.1 The Communicating Investment Group Model The investors in a communicating investment group manage an equal share of the initial group wealth over a number of investment periods. <p> We do not limit 6 The optimal choice depends on factors such as the volatility of the market and the number of investors in the group. There is a tradeoff between allowing migration of strategies, but maintaining sufficient diversity in the system <ref> (Parkes and Huberman, 1998) </ref>. the number of times that an investor can change strategies, other than forcing an investor to use a new strategy for at least t investment periods before posting to the blackboard or switching to another strategy. <p> In general the choice of learning-rate represents a classic tradeoff between return and risk. A high learning rate enables adaptive investors to perform well on average, but with a high chance of performing worse than non-adaptive investors <ref> (Parkes and Huberman, 1998) </ref>. Fig. 3.

The slow improvement in performance for the group of non-adaptive investors as the number of investors increases shows the effect of simple diversification.

Reference-contexts: We simulate the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which models an equilibrium for mean-variance investors with homogeneous beliefs <ref> (Sharpe, 1970) </ref>. CAPM augments the standard geometric Brownian motion model with correlations between stock prices. <p> We then assign covariances to satisfy "efficiency constraints" and complete a multivariate Normal distribution that will induce a sequence of stock prices with statistics that fall approximately onto the "security market line" <ref> (Sharpe, 1970) </ref>, such that the excess return of each stock is proportional to its covariance with the market portfolio. 2000 trials. <p> The CAPM market model is derived under assumptions that investor's hold homogeneous beliefs about the future dynamics of stocks <ref> (Sharpe, 1970) </ref>. Communication between investors is implicit in the realized price dynamics of stocks. The CAPM model "closes the loop" between investor actions and price dynamics, and there is nothing more to be gained from further communication. Fig. 7.
