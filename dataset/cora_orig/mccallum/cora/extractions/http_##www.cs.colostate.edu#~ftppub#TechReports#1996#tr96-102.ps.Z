Failure modes such as gate-oxide shorts, bridging defects, parasitic transistor leakage, defective p-n junctions, and transistors with incorrect threshold voltages, do not affect the logical behavior.

Reference-contexts: Quiescent power supply currents can be monitored during parallel access of locations or subset of locations (blocks) of each partition. Test speed is enhanced by comparing currents in the two partitions using a built-in current comparator (BICC). This paper is an extension of the differential concept proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> Each segment holds one bit of each logical word. A segment decoder is required to route input data to different segments. To achieve a I DDQ testable scheme with high test accuracy and speed with small hardware overhead, design modifications are required to meet three basic goals <ref> [9] </ref>: 1 Efficient partitioning of memory array into identical blocks of a reasonable size. 2 Block write/read operations during the testing mode to access locations within a block in each partition in parallel. 3 Efficient BICC circuit with high sensitivity and accurate I th selection. <p> Since b t n, the testing process is speeded-up proportional to (n/b). However the accuracy of testing depends also on the performance and sensitivity of the comparator BICS used for current monitoring. 5 Conclusions We have extended the differential concept in <ref> [9] </ref> for a general I DDQ testable SRAM design. The proposed scheme employs memory array partitioning and parallel write/read operations, during which several faults are activated with elevated quiescent power supply current. The currents are compared in one phase for each opearion.

Reference-contexts: Identical partition sizes imply similar ground line capacitance values for each partition. A built-in current comparator (BICC) is used to compare the quiescent power supply currents of two partitions during the testing mode while accessing their locations simulta-neously. A sensor similar to the Differential BIC (D-BIC) proposed in <ref> [10] </ref> may be used as the BICC. With the D-BIC, testing is performed in two phases. The circuit is partitioned into two identical parts CUT1 and CUT2. Test vectors are applied to CUT1 and the current is compared to a reference current value in one phase.

Reference-contexts: From this design shown in 4 Test Scheme Faults that enhance I DDQ are mainly transition faults, state coupling and bridging faults, and neighborhood pattern sensitive faults. To detect state coupling and bridging faults, all states of two adjacent cells i and j in a segment should be considered <ref> [11] </ref>. The testing sequence contains a set of parallel write/read operations to the blocks, such that if a test vector v is applied to block i, then v is applied to block (i + 1). A minimal test sequence contains two patterns each of (00000000) and (11111111) test vectors.
