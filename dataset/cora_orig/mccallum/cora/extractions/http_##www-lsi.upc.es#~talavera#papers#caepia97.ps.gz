Abstract: Conceptual clustering is an important form of unsupervised learning. Although the original formulation of this paradigm proposes the use of a body of background knowledge in the clustering process, most of the approaches to this task assume that no external knowledge exists. This paper argues for a background knowledge guided conceptual clustering approach, that is, a conceptual clustering scheme capable of using prior knowledge to guide the inductive search. These ideas are briefly compared to previous attempts to achieve an integration of empirical and theory-driven learning which usually put the stress in the analytical learning component. The role of attribute relevances as background knowledge is explored and exemplified with the ISAAC/2 conceptual clustering system. Preliminary results seem to suggest at least two possible benefits of using this approach: constructing a goal-driven conceptual clustering framework and achieving a more interactive knowledge discovery.

Reference-contexts: Any conceptual clustering system can benefit from the first approach without adaptation by just using a subset of the initial attribute set. An example of the second approach is the LINNEO + <ref> (Bejar et al., 1997) </ref> system which allows experts to define a domain theory in the form of a set of classifying rules expressing a partial domain theory.

Reference-contexts: A clear example is the application of unsupervised learning methods to knowledge discovery tasks in which the use of domain knowledge is deemed to be an important feature for learning systems <ref> (Fayyad et al., 1996) </ref>. This paper explores the feasibility of using background knowledge in the form of attribute relevances in the conceptual clustering task. First, some ideas about the role of background knowledge in learning are given in order to introduce the concept of background knowledge guided conceptual clustering.

Reference-contexts: Background knowledge can also change the preference ordering of hypotheses during search. Reich (1994) proposes the use of knowledge to override the concept quality measure used in the COBWEB system <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref> by constraining the sort of concepts to be created. The presence of background knowledge might alter the way in that COBWEB traverses the search space, leading the system to create quite different categories from those that would be created in the absence of knowledge. <p> This sort of representation provides greater flexibility than the logical ones, allowing graded concept descriptions to be created. Probabilistic representations are present in a number of conceptual clustering systems, COBWEB <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref> being the most representative example. ISAAC allows the user to specify some preferences about the hierarchies it produces. The user can decide the degree of generality of the induced partitions via the N G parameter, which is in the [0,1] range.

Reference-contexts: Also, ISAAC/2, a simple adaptation of the system for using external background knowledge in the form of attribute relevances is detailed. Following that, some preliminary experiments are reported and finally, some 1 This term includes the so called concept formation systems <ref> (Gennari, Langley & Fisher, 1989) </ref> since they are a special case of conceptual clustering with a somewhat more constrained requirements. 2 conclusions and future work are presented. 2 Background knowledge and learning Inductive (or empirical) learning is a form of learning concerned with the generation of new knowledge as opposed to

Reference-contexts: Such a search space is extremely large, so conceptual clustering systems (and inductive systems in general) must constraint this space and determine which are the best hypotheses. This preference for one hypothesis over another is known as the inductive bias <ref> (Gordon & Desjardins, 1995) </ref>. From 3 this perspective, background knowledge can help to guide the inductive process and act as a semantic bias. We can refer to this approach as background knowledge guided conceptual clustering.

Reference-contexts: Fisher and Langley (1986) refer to these two tasks as the aggregation and characterization problems respectively. The aggregation problem is the focus of statistical cluster analysis techniques <ref> (Jain & Dubes, 1988) </ref> and the characterization problem is the focus of supervised learning. Thus, a natural solution to the unsupervised learning task is to first group all the observations using some statistical clustering technique, and then characterize the resulting clusters using some form of supervised learning.

Reference-contexts: In the actual implementation of the system, it computes the relevance of each individual attribute using a relevance measure formerly used in attribute selection in decision trees, called the distance measure <ref> (Lopez de Mantaras, 1991) </ref>, and the current set of concepts. The attributes which do not score high enough are declared irrelevant and are discarded. ISAAC assumes that in more general levels the set of attributes necessary to discriminate among the concepts created is smaller than in more specific levels.

Reference-contexts: However, the number of partitions in which a collection of observations can be divided is exponential and a lot of iterations between the two phases may be needed before finding a suitable clustering. Methods of conceptual clustering 1 <ref> (Michalski & Stepp, 1983) </ref> approach the unsupervised learning problem proposing that clusters have to be created if there is a conceptual cohesiveness between instances. Conceptual cohesiveness depends not only of the syntactic similarity between objects, but also in any contextual information and background knowledge available.

Reference-contexts: Unsupervised learning deals with domains in with instances are unclassified so that the amount of background knowledge assumed to be available is always minimum. In Machine Learning, deductive learning is generally referred to as analytical learning. The most popular form of analytic learning is probably Explanation Based Learning (EBL) <ref> (Mitchell et al., 1986) </ref>. Typically, an EBL system uses the background knowledge contained in a domain theory to prove that an example is a member of a class and deduce a new rule which classifies more efficiently new similar examples.

Reference-contexts: A number of systems make use of two separate learning modules which interact in an unidirectional manner. For example, OCCAM (Pazzani et al., 1987) uses empirical learning to learn domain knowledge which is then used by the analytical component. In contrast, IOU (Induction Over the Unexplained) <ref> (Mooney, 1993) </ref> uses a domain theory to acquire part of a concept description and then uses induction focusing in the unexplained aspects.

Reference-contexts: It would seem that EBL learning is better suited to deal with complex real-world problems since it is widely recognized that prior knowledge plays an important role in human learning processes <ref> (Murphy & Medin, 1985, Medin, 1989) </ref>. However, EBL systems require a large body of background knowledge which must also satisfy a number of constraints (consistency, completeness, correctness, etc.). Hence, they cannot solve some learning problems in which some of these constraints do not hold.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the ISAAC/2 conceptual clustering system has been presented as an example of combining empirical relevances with relevances obtained from background knowledge. Preliminary results indicate at least two interesting roles for background knowledge in such as system. The first is concerned with considering conceptual as a goal-driven process <ref> (Ram & Leake, 1995) </ref>, which may rely on purely empirical procedures when no knowledge is available. The learning goals would be expressed with some knowledge representation mechanism from which attribute relevances relevances would be inferred. The second role is related to interactive knowledge discovery.

Reference-contexts: Since the system is designed to make use of attribute relevance information gathered during the induction process, it makes possible to include knowledge about prior relevances in a natural manner. ISAAC organizes its concepts in probabilistic concept hierarchies. A probabilistic concept <ref> (Smith & Medin, 1981) </ref> is represented as a summary description that lists attribute values and its associated probabilities.

Reference-contexts: Next, the use of attribute relevances as a knowledge source is discussed. In order to show the applicability of the proposed ideas, the ISAAC conceptual clustering system <ref> (Talavera & Cortes, 1996) </ref> is outlined. Also, ISAAC/2, a simple adaptation of the system for using external background knowledge in the form of attribute relevances is detailed. <p> Therefore, attribute relevances are viewed as knowledge expressed in a form suitable to be used by the inductive system and inferred by means of some independent inference mechanism. 4 Combining empirical and external relevances in conceptual clustering: the ISAAC system In this section the main features of the ISAAC <ref> (Talavera & Cortes, 1996) </ref> conceptual clustering system are presented. Since the system is designed to make use of attribute relevance information gathered during the induction process, it makes possible to include knowledge about prior relevances in a natural manner. ISAAC organizes its concepts in probabilistic concept hierarchies.

Reference-contexts: Also, Reich (1994) outlines the idea of using attribute weights in clustering using an extension of COBWEB. A similar approach is taken in the CONFORT system <ref> (Vasco et al., 1996) </ref>, another COBWEB-like method. However, none of these proposals account for a combination of empirical and external relevances as ISAAC/2 does. Future research should be addressed to identify weaknesses of the attribute relevance based approach in the context of more complex domains and preferably, real applications.

Reference-contexts: He also outlines that background knowledge can suggest important features of observations. This effect of theoretical knowledge in training data is also pointed out by psychologists, who have noted that people selectively attend to different features in the input according to different theories <ref> (Wisniewski & Medin, 1991) </ref>. This idea may be adapted to conceptual clustering by giving learning systems the capability of using contextual information about the importance of the attributes. It is relatively easy to derive attribute relevances from a domain theory.
