Title: Porting UNIX* to Windows NT  
Author: David G. Korn 
Address: Murray Hill, N. J. 07974  
Affiliation: AT&T Laboratories  
Abstract: The Software Engineering Research department at Murray Hill writes and distributes several widely used development tools and reusable libraries that are portable across virtually all UNIX platforms. [1] To enhance reuse of these tools and libraries, we want to make them available on systems running Windows NT [2] and/or Windows 95 [3] . We did not want to support multiple versions of these libraries, and we wanted to minimize the amount of conditionally compiled code. This paper describes an effort of trying to build a UNIX interface layer on top of the Windows NT and Windows 95 operating system. The goal was to build an open environment rich enough to be both a good development environment and a suitable execution environment. This meant that the overhead needed to be small enough so that there was no incentive to program to the native operating system directly. The openness meant that the complete facilities of the native operating system were accessible through this environment. The result of this effort is a set of libraries, headers, and utilities that we collectively refer to as UWIN. UWIN contains nearly all the X/Open Release 4 [4] headers, interfaces and commands. We discuss alternative porting strategies, commercial products, design goals, problems that had to be overcome, and the current status. Some performance measurements of the current system are presented here.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it often limits you to the least common denominator of features of the different operating systems. An alternative is to build a middleware layer based on existing standards. This has been the approach followed by IBM with the introduction of OpenEdition <ref> [5] </ref> for the MVS operating system, URL http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe. OpenEdition is X/Open compliant so that a large collection of existing software can be transported at little cost. Windows NT is an operating system developed by Microsoft to fill the needs of the high-end market.

Reference-contexts: Windows NT is an operating system developed by Microsoft to fill the needs of the high-end market. It is a layered architecture, designed from the ground up, built around a microkernel that is similar to Mach. <ref> [6] </ref> One or more subsystems can reside on top of the microkernel which gives Windows NT the ability to run different logical operating systems simultaneously. For example, the OS/2 subsystem allows OS/2 applications to run on Windows NT.

Reference-contexts: For example, the OS/2 subsystem allows OS/2 applications to run on Windows NT. The most important subsystem that runs on Windows NT is the WIN32 subsystem. The WIN32 subsystem runs all applications that are written to the WIN32 Application Programming Interface (API) <ref> [7] </ref> . The API for the WIN32 subsystem is also provided with Windows 95, although not all of the functions are implemented. In most instances binaries compiled for Windows NT that use the WIN32 API will also run on Windows 95.

Reference-contexts: In most instances binaries compiled for Windows NT that use the WIN32 API will also run on Windows 95. The POSIX subsystem allows applications that are strictly conforming to the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 operating system standard <ref> [8] </ref> to run on Windows NT. Since the POSIX standard contains most of the standard UNIX system call interface, many UNIX utilities are simple to port to any POSIX system.

Reference-contexts: Thus, you cannot even invoke the Microsoft C compiler from within the POSIX subsystem. However, since you can invoke POSIX commands from the WIN32 subsystem, it is possible to port some stand alone programs to the POSIX subsystem. For example, we ported the pax utility, the POSIX 1003.2 <ref> [9] </ref> replacement for cpio and tar, to Windows NT, and it can be invoked from any WIN32 program. Softway System, Inc., URL http://www.softway.com, has an agreement with Microsoft to enhance the POSIX subsystem so that they can achieve POSIX 1003.2 conformance.

Reference-contexts: After the initial set of utilities was running, we wanted to get several socket based tools working. Several projects at AT&T that became interested in using our libraries, required the System V IPC facilities. The S graphics system <ref> [10] </ref> and ksh-93 [11] required runtime dynamic linking. As the project progressed, the need for privileged users, such as root on UNIX systems, surfaced. We decided that it was important to have setuid and setgid capabilities.

Reference-contexts: We needed to have a complete set of UNIX development tools since we didn't want to get into the business of rewriting makefiles or changing build scripts. Most code written at AT&T, including our own, uses nmake <ref> [12] </ref> , (no relation to the Microsoft nmake), but we also wanted to be able to support other make variants. We didn't want to do manual configuration on tools that have automatic configuration scripts.

Reference-contexts: There is no distinction between upper and lower case although the case is preserved. HPFS, which stands for High Performance File System, was designed for OS/2. NTFS, the native NT File System, is similar to the Berkeley file system. <ref> [13] </ref> It allows long file names (up to 255 characters) and supports both upper and lower case characters. It stores file names as 16 bit Unicode names. The file system namespace in Win32 is hierarchical as it is in UNIX and DOS.
