Reference-contexts: The capacitance matrix method has been further employed as a discrete analogy to the potential theory for partial differential equations by Proskurowski and Wildlund [9] [10], Shieh [12] [13], O'Leary and Wildlund [8], Dryja [3], Borgers and Wildlund <ref> [1] </ref>, and others. They used the framework of the capacitance matrix method to solve the second-order elliptic boundary value problems. Although the matrix B could be singular for the Neumann problem, the chosen matrix A was assumed to be nonsingular. <p> The traditional capacitance matrix method <ref> [2, 9, 12, 13, 8, 10, 3, 1] </ref> has been primarily applied to solve the second-order elliptic boundary value problems, whereas our modified capacitance matrix method ( presented above ) can be used to solve higher-order elliptic boundary value problems.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the choice of a well-structured matrix A which is close to the original matrix is limited to be nonsingular.

Reference-contexts: When A 2 &lt; nfin , U; V 2 &lt; nfip , and both the matrices A and (I + V T A 1 U) are nonsingular, the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula <ref> [4] </ref> gives an expression for the inverse of (A + UV T ) as (A + UV T ) 1 = A 1 A 1 U (I + V T A 1 U) 1 V T A 1 : (1) The above assumptions imply that the matrix (A + UV T <p> Thus, we have 0 B 1 m B C A = T B @ . . . 1 C where T 2 &lt; m B fim A is of full rank. By using the Householder or Givens transformation <ref> [4] </ref>, we can obtain the factorization of T as follows: T = 0 T Q; (7) where 0 is an m B fi (m A m B ) zero matrix, T 2 &lt; m B fim B is nonsingular, and Q 2 &lt; m A fim A is orthogonal.

Reference-contexts: The matrix (I + V T A 1 U) is called the capacitance matrix and is denoted by C: Note that a similar formula can be obtained for the inverse of (A + UGV T ), where the matrix G 2 &lt; pfip is nonsingular <ref> [5] </ref>. Let B = A + UV T , with A, B, and C being nonsingular, then the linear system Bx = b can be solved using the traditional capacitance matrix method, which involves the following steps: 1. Solve Ax = b for x: 2.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, efficient numerical algorithms can be designed [14, 7] based on an appropriate choice of the matrix A. Some works on the extension of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula in equation 1 to singular A, B, and the associated capacitance matrix C have been reported in <ref> [6] </ref>, [11], and references therein. However, the generalized inverse forms of (A + UGV T ) have been derived under restrictive assumptions. Although we can make use of these generalized inverse formulas to design the corresponding capacitance matrix methods, these assumptions restrict them from being applied to general linear systems.
