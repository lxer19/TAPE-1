Reference-contexts: In either case, errors would be introduced to subsequent feature measurements. Based on the underlying intensities distributions, various techniques have been developed for automatic selection of an optimal threshold value <ref> [1] </ref>. Employing different specialized principles, these algorithms usually require that the intensity distribution of the image be bimodal. The relative high contrast between vegetative cuttings and the background allows most of these thresholding algorithms applicable to our problem. <p> The adaptive threshold can account for the spatial variations in image contrast and compensate for a variety of local spatial context effects by using a spatially varying threshold. The adaptive thresholding we implemented is a modified version of the technique developed by Chow and Kaneko <ref> [1] </ref>. The technique starts with dividing an entire image into mutually exclusive blocks. Based on experimentation, the optimal block size for our project was found to be 80x54.

Reference-contexts: Our assumption is that the length and width of the best fitting rectangle should constitute an optimal estimate of the length and width of the stem. To fit a rectangle to a stem blob, we developed an iterative gradient-descent rectangle-fitting method. Like the popular ellipse fitting algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, this algorithm is based on the premise that the spatial moments of a mass can fully characterize its orientation, location, its shape, and its contour. Though having been successfully applied to ellipse fitting, this method for rectangle fitting has not been found in literature. <p> Figure 11 shows a rectan gle that has been fitted to the stem shown in Figure 10. (2) L L pL W W pW 16 An alternative for determining the length and caliber of the stem blob is to use the extreme points method as introduced by Haralick <ref> [2] </ref>. It computes the lengths of the major and minor axis using the eight extreme points. The shortcoming with this method is that it is very sensitive to noise since the extreme points of a blob may be subject to local irregularities. 5.2.

Reference-contexts: The task of segmentation is therefore to segment the plant blob we obtained from thresholding into three distinct smaller blobs representing leaves, leaf petioles, and stem respectively. Various techniques have been developed to perform segmentation. For example, Peleg <ref> [3] </ref> suggested use of curvature of boundary edge pixels for segmenting a plant image into distinct blobs. The basic premise of this method is that each blob can be delimited by two edge points with maximal curvatures.

Reference-contexts: Employing different specialized principles, these algorithms usually require that the intensity distribution of the image be bimodal. The relative high contrast between vegetative cuttings and the background allows most of these thresholding algorithms applicable to our problem. Among these algorithms, we have used the algorithm developed by Otsu <ref> [4] </ref> due to its simplicity in implementation and fast execution speed. According to this algorithm, given a threshold, it divides the intensity distribution into two groups, representing the object and background respectively. Means and variances are then computed for each group.

Reference-contexts: Since we do not have prior information about the underlying distribution of our data, a non-parametric technique was implemented. We have used a method called Memory Based Learning implemented in a package called GMBL <ref> [5] </ref>. The classifiers it implements include k-nearest neighbor averaging and local regression. One of the most important features of this package is that given a dataset, it can be used to automatically choose optimal features and their weights (relative importance associated with each feature).
