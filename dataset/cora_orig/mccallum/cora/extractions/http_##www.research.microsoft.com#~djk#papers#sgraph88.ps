Abstract: Graphical search is a technique for finding all instances of a graphical pattern in a synthetic picture in which objects are regions bounded by lines and curves. The pattern may describe shape, color and other properties. Matched objects may be allowed to differ from the pattern in rotation and scale or may differ in shape by a specified tolerance. Graphical replace is a technique for replacing the shape, color, or other properties of matched objects with new properties described in a replacement pattern. Combined, the two techniques are similar to textual search and replace in text editors. Graphical search and replace can be used to make global changes to illustrations with repetitive patterns, independent of the means used to make those patterns. It can also be used to create a class of iterative or recursive shapes that can be specified by replacement rules.

Reference-contexts: Such relational metrics have appeared in the literature [3]. We would also like a better way to search for objects that "look like" the search pattern. We may be able to apply string matching techniques <ref> [2] </ref> to this problem. Exact pattern matches on curves of known type are an important special case for graphical search. By comparing the curve control points directly instead of comparing polyline representations, we could significantly speed up the majority of searches.

Reference-contexts: The representation of graphical information in databases has been studied [7, 15]. Graphical search and replace can also be viewed as a method for specifying graphical grammars that generate recursive shapes. Shape grammars, a subset of graphical grammars, have been analyzed extensively <ref> [5, 12] </ref>, and grammars have been used in graphics to make realistic imagery [11]. Pattern recognition algorithms have been used to search for occurrences of a particular shape [6, 8]. Some of these algorithms are appropriate for use in graphical search and replace.
