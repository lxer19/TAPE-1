Abstract: 1.0 Abstract Distributed systems in use today depend heavily on network communications between clients and servers. In this report, we describe the design and implementation of the network architecture (hardware, software and protocols) of the RAID-II system. RAID-II is a high speed network file server connected to an UltraNetwork. In order to support high bandwidth network transfers with the RAID-II server, we partitioned the networking software among the various processors in the system. Measurements of the system show that the RAID-II server can sustain 21MB/ s of data bandwidth to the Ultranet. Over the past decade, we have experienced a major shift from centralized computing using mainframes to a distributed model of computing using workstations connected via high-performance networks. In the traditional mainframe-centered view of computer systems, storage devices are tightly coupled to the computation system. In the newer workstation model of computing, storage is attached to file servers distributed throughout a network. The workstation clients make file requests

Reference-contexts: These numbers indicate that the 29K CPUs would limit the network to approximately 32Mbytes/second for both reads and writes to RAID-II. 7.0 Conclusions The two basic goals of the RAID-II network software were to provide high bandwidth to clients on the UltraNetwork and reduce the load on the host CPU. <ref> [Chen93] </ref> measurements indicate that the RAID-II system hardware can support a raw bandwidth of 38.5MBytes/sec between memory and the network.

This provides a maximum aggregate bandwidth of 10.5MBytes/second. RAID-II is capable of completely satisfying this network load. Under the current maximum load, all clients receive data at their full desired bandwidth. Therefore, bandwidth limitations of the RAID-II network interface can currently only be estimated from scaling arguments.

Reference-contexts: Upgrading the host CPU to more modern hardware would allow the RAID-II system to source 32MBytes/second to the network. This bandwidth is significantly higher than that of Ethernet-based file servers in our environment. For comparison, our Sprite OS file server supports a bandwidth of about 1MByte/sec to the network <ref> [Welch90] </ref>. These results show that the RAID-II network interface is effective at providing a high bandwidth to clients on the Ultranet.
