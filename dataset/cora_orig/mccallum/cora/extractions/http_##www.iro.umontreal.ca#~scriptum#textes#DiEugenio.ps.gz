Reference-contexts: Following <ref> [Pollack, 1986; Balkanski, 1993] </ref> I will call such plans recipes. <p> This problem is often bypassed in action representation formalisms | e.g. in <ref> [Goldman, 1970; Pollack, 1986; Balkanski, 1993] </ref> | by requiring that the agent be in standard conditions with respect to the action to be performed. 116 I am mentioning all this in order to justify my representation: the qualifiers and effects I list are merely a part of the required list of <p> Allen's work has had an enormous impact on research on temporal issues in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics; for example the predicates HOLDS and OCCURS used in [Pollack, 1986] and <ref> [Balkanski, 1993] </ref> derive from Allen's formalization. Given that temporal relations are not the focus of my work, I won't have anything else to contribute about them | in fact they won't play any particular role in the examples I will present in the next chapter. <p> I am also fully aware that such representation is not sufficient to account for miscommunication, as Pollack showed in her thesis [1986]; moreover, that a fuller representation could benefit from Balkanski's findings about beliefs and intentions in PCs and in Means Clauses <ref> [Balkanski, 1993] </ref>. <p> My answers to these questions affect both the knowledge about actions to be represented, and the algorithm that processes such instructions. In particular my analysis, by showing that 166 purpose clauses express generation or enablement between ff and fi, lends support to the proposal, made in <ref> [Pollack, 1986; Balkanski, 1993] </ref>, that these two relations should be used in modelling actions. 4. I proposed an action representation formalism that provides the required flexibility. Its two main components are the TBox which encodes linguistic knowledge about actions, and the Action Library, which encodes planning knowledge about actions. <p> A well developed Speaker / Hearer Model would build on top of Balkanski's findings about beliefs and intentions in PCs and in Means Clauses <ref> [Balkanski, 1993] </ref>, discussed in Sec. 4.1.2.2, to include also cases in which instructions describe general rules of behavior, or advice on how to act in particular situations: these are cases in which a PC provides, not so much a goal to achieve, but a description of the situation in which a

Reference-contexts: CLASSIC's designers have taken advantage of their experience regarding user needs, implementational methods, complexity measures, and the importance of certain distinctions. The result is a tractable and reasonably expressive KR system. CLASSIC's language is described as follows in <ref> [Brachman et al., 1991, p.407-409] </ref>: Concept Forming Operators. * PRIMITIVE, DISJOINT-PRIMITIVE. They allow a user to form concepts that cannot be fully specified by necessary and sufficient conditions. <p> Finally, one can express rules of the form A ) B where A and B are concepts. Rules are not considered by the classifier and are thus considered assertional. <ref> [Brachman et al., 1991, p.405] </ref> describes the deductive inferences that CLASSIC provides: * Completion: Logical consequences of assertions about individuals and descriptions of concepts are computed; there are a number of "completion" inferences CLASSIC can make: Inheritance: Restrictions that apply to instances of a concept must also apply to instances of <p> The information is then propagated that the individual Chateau-d-Yquem-Sauterne must be a dry wine. <ref> [Brachman et al., 1991, p.411] </ref>. 99 Contradiction detection: It is possible to accidentally assert two facts about an individual that are logically impossible to conjoin. CLASSIC detects this kind of contradiction. <p> In Figs. 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, I present part of the T-Box that I have implemented in CLASSIC <ref> [Brachman et al., 1991] </ref> and whose complete CLASSIC version the reader can find in Appendix C. The graphical conventions are as follows (adapted from [Woods and Schmolze, 1991, p.9]. Concepts are represented by ellipses and roles are represented by small circles containing inscribed squares.

Reference-contexts: However, there are only few systems known to me that exploit subsumption to perform reasoning about plans: SUDO-PLANNER [Wellman, 1988], CLASP <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991] </ref> and T-REX [Weida and Litman, 1992]. 17 In SUDO-PLANNER actions | those events controllable by the planner | are defined by means of the T-Box of NIKL [Moser et al., 1983]. <p> In particular, the CLASP algorithms for plan subsumption integrate work in automata theory with work in term subsumption. Plans are built out of actions, whose definition reproduces the classic STRIPS planning operator definition, as it includes the roles precondition, add-list, delete-list, goal, all restricted to be state | <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991, p.132] </ref>: (DEFINE-CONCEPT Action (PRIMITIVE (AND Classic-Thing (AT-LEAST 1 ACTOR) (ALL ACTOR Agent) (ALL PRECONDITION State) (ALL ADD-LIST State) (ALL DELETE-LIST State) (ALL GOAL State)))) As far as plans are concerned, plan concept expressions are compositionally defined from action and state concepts using the plan description forming operators <p> (AND Classic-Thing (AT-LEAST 1 ACTOR) (ALL ACTOR Agent) (ALL PRECONDITION State) (ALL ADD-LIST State) (ALL DELETE-LIST State) (ALL GOAL State)))) As far as plans are concerned, plan concept expressions are compositionally defined from action and state concepts using the plan description forming operators SEQUENCE, LOOP, REPEAT, TEST, OR, and SUBPLAN. <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991, p.132] </ref> The ordinary subsumption algorithm provided by CLASSIC and called o-subsumption, where o stays for object , is extended into p-subsumption to deal with plan and scenario classification, where scenarios are individual plans. The details of p-subsumption can be found in [Devanbu and Litman, 1991, p.134-135]. <p> The details of p-subsumption can be found in <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991, p.134-135] </ref>. Finally, T-REX [Weida and Litman, 1992] is similar in spirit to CLASP, but is able to capture finer temporal relations, and integrates terminological reasoning with constraint network reasoning to classify plans. <p> I will report on work whose motivations stem either from Natural Language processing or from plan inference and planning. Obviously, the classification algorithm itself performs structure matching. In Sec. 6.2.2, I already discussed two systems that extend subsumption to actions and plans, [Wellman, 1988] and CLASP <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991] </ref>. 7.3.1 Rule systems and pattern matching It is clear that the problem of structure matching arises for example in rule-based systems. I will report here on some work by Joshi and Rosenschein [1976; 1978], which addresses the problem of performing matches with only partial information. <p> The results he 15 Although the solutions in [Tenenberg, 1989] hold for an arbitrary number of levels of abstraction, he refers to two levels in particular, abstract and concrete. 163 obtains with first order theories could probably be obtained as well exploiting subsumption, as was done in CLASP <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991] </ref>: in fact, CLASP subsumption between plans seems to be more flexible than Tenenberg's model. <p> This type of reasoning is performed in CLASP <ref> [Devanbu and Litman, 1991] </ref>, which is built on top of CLASSIC: therefore a first extension to my formalism would be to integrate the more complex action descriptions I use with the subsumption mechanisms proposed in CLASP.

Reference-contexts: The problem of listing all necessary and sufficient conditions plagues AI systems: for example, well-known are the qualification and the frame problems. The first arises with regard to universally quantified sentences, such as "All birds fly". <ref> [Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987, p.117] </ref> notes that we might express this as 8x Bird (x) ) Flies (x). This sentence might be useful for certain limited purposes, but we would soon be confronted by the fact that ostriches, which are birds, do not fly. <p> Work on default reasoning addresses this problem. On the other hand, the frame problem is the problem of characterizing the aspects of a state that are not changed by an action, and it arises for example in the context of defining planning operators <ref> [Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987, p.271-2] </ref>. These operator descriptions are not complete, as they describe the facts that become true as a result of executing instances of each operator, and indirectly they describe the facts that become false.

Reference-contexts: According to [Levin and Pinker, 1991, p.2-3] 6 Note that object-oriented programming languages usually have inheritance, but not classification. 7 This was called recognition or realization in Sec. 6.1.1. 8 For example <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990] </ref>. 100 The assumption underlying much of this current linguistic research | that syntactic properties of phrases reflect, in large part, the meanings of the words that head them | also provides a powerful new methodology for studying word meaning. ... <p> An important CS primitive that will play a role in the following is CAUSE | <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990, p.44] </ref>: An Event [can be elaborated] as the Event-function CAUSE plus two arguments. The first argument, if a Thing, is the agent; if an Event, is Cause. The second argument, an Event, is the Effect. <p> For example, in (6.11) Bill is both Theme and Actor, but the room is only the Goal, not also the Patient: in fact, in (6.11) there is no Patient. (6.11) Bill entered the room. According to <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990, p.128] </ref> The action tier enables us to dissect the traditional notion of Agent into a number of independent parts ... One sense of Agent, "extrinsic instigator of action", is captured by the role "first argument of CAUSE", an element in the thematic tier. <p> Notice the purpose clause in the example: the function FOR is used in <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990] </ref> to encode the subordinating function for purpose clauses. Another CS primitive that I haven't mentioned so far is INCH, which is used to encode inchoative readings of verb phrases. <p> Jackendoff notes that apparently INCH introduces a redundancy, as (6.15a) and (6.15b) appear to encode the same event. (6.15a) [GO ([X], [ Path TO ([ Place Y])])] (6.15b) [INCH ([BE ([X], [ Place Y])])] I refer the reader to <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990, p.93-95] </ref> as regards the reasons why this is not the case. The conceptual atom fill, introduced by [White, 1992], serves as a pointer to semantic information not captured by the decomposition. 10 Finally, AT-END-OF is another Place function introduced in [Jackendoff, 1990]. <p> The conceptual atom fill, introduced by [White, 1992], serves as a pointer to semantic information not captured by the decomposition. 10 Finally, AT-END-OF is another Place function introduced in <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990] </ref>. This representation makes evident features that are not explicit in the given sentence, such as where the fuel cap has to be removed from. The representation finesses this as AT ([fuel-cap]), namely, where the fuel cap is now. <p> On the other hand, a KL-ONE style representation will make it possible to use Conceptual Structures in a computational framework, by endowing it with a hierarchical organization and with the possibility of extending the lexicon. A flavor of hierarchical organization is present in <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990] </ref> itself. Consider (6.3), repeated here for convenience: (6.16a) [ Thing kitchen] (6.16b) [ Thing room] room and kitchen are atoms in Conceptual Structures, and so are many other entities, such as liquid and wine. <p> However, it wouldn't be difficult to finesse the representation and to give a more accurate account of volitionality, along the lines of <ref> [Jackendoff, 1990, p. 128-129] </ref>. caused-role be go-sp-from-to.

Reference-contexts: Such knowledge is specified declaratively, with the specifications mapped into a structure of low-level actions that can be input to the simulator.

Reference-contexts: The idea of having plan abstraction hierarchies is not new in plan inference / planning work, as it is present in different forms in various systems, for example <ref> [Kautz, 1990; Tenenberg, 1989] </ref>, that will both be described in Sec. 7.3. <p> I will now go back to some of those systems and focus on whether and how their algorithms perform some sort of structural matching. In general in all these approaches action descriptions are primitive terms, while in my case they are structured. 7.3.3.1 Kautz The problem that <ref> [Kautz, 1990] </ref> sets out to solve is to infer the plan (s) underlying a sequence of events. Kautz's representation is based on event hierarchies . An event hierarchy is a collection of first-order axioms expressing abstraction and decomposition relations among events.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between BASIC-RECIPE and NON-BASIC-RECIPE is due to the fact that basic-act-types are considered as primitives at this level of representation, and they don't have hierarchical decomposition | I take here advantage of the AnimNL system, that will provide the necessary decomposition in lower level actions <ref> [Webber et al., 1992; Levison, 1993] </ref>. It is a notorious difficult problem to define what a basic act-type is, as I already mentioned in Sec. 5.1.3. <p> Characterized as a door however, the agent develops different expectations about the object than if it had been characterized as a window (e.g., about constraints on its motion, locations of possible latches, etc.).

Qualifiers, alternatively called applicability conditions [Schoppers, 1988], constraints <ref> [Litman and Allen, 1990] </ref>, or usewhen conditions [Tate, 1987], express conditions that must hold for an action to be relevant, and are not meant to be achieved.

Reference-contexts: Thus AnimNL agents have to open doors, closets, boxes, etc., if they want to know what is inside, or go into other rooms to find out what is there, namely, they have to explore their environment. This is done through search plans <ref> [Moore, 1993] </ref>: search plans give an agent the ability to try out hypotheses about the environment (e.g. cracking a safe by trying out various combinations, opening and looking into kitchen cabinets to find a bowl of sugar, etc.) and thereby expand its knowledge and ability to act in its environment.

Reference-contexts: Following <ref> [Pollack, 1986; Balkanski, 1993] </ref> I will call such plans recipes. <p> It is a notorious difficult problem to define what a basic act-type is, as I already mentioned in Sec. 5.1.3. From <ref> [Pollack, 1986, p.59] </ref> Basic actions are, essentially, actions that can be performed at will; typical examples in the literature are an agent's raising his arm, or turning his head. But there is a second important condition on basic actions: they are not performed by doing another action. ... <p> Also notice that in certain recipes, as in Fig. 7.10, the operator ACHIEVE is used; ACHIEVE is defined as a function from states to actions <ref> [Pollack, 1986] </ref>. The CLASSIC definition for ACHIEVE can be found in Appendix C. As we can see from the BNF, individual action entries have a header , body , qualifiers and effects. <p> This problem is often bypassed in action representation formalisms | e.g. in <ref> [Goldman, 1970; Pollack, 1986; Balkanski, 1993] </ref> | by requiring that the agent be in standard conditions with respect to the action to be performed. 116 I am mentioning all this in order to justify my representation: the qualifiers and effects I list are merely a part of the required list of <p> Allen's work has had an enormous impact on research on temporal issues in Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics; for example the predicates HOLDS and OCCURS used in <ref> [Pollack, 1986] </ref> and [Balkanski, 1993] derive from Allen's formalization. Given that temporal relations are not the focus of my work, I won't have anything else to contribute about them | in fact they won't play any particular role in the examples I will present in the next chapter. <p> In general, events are terms rather than structures, and terminological inferences are not of concern. 7.3.3.2 Pollack I already discussed the main contributions of <ref> [Pollack, 1986; Pollack, 1990] </ref> in Sec. 3.2.1.2; here I would like to briefly discuss the algorithm she implements. <p> My answers to these questions affect both the knowledge about actions to be represented, and the algorithm that processes such instructions. In particular my analysis, by showing that 166 purpose clauses express generation or enablement between ff and fi, lends support to the proposal, made in <ref> [Pollack, 1986; Balkanski, 1993] </ref>, that these two relations should be used in modelling actions. 4. I proposed an action representation formalism that provides the required flexibility. Its two main components are the TBox which encodes linguistic knowledge about actions, and the Action Library, which encodes planning knowledge about actions.

Reference-contexts: The issue is then to find a representation that is both linguistically motivated, and that is also useful with respect to the representation of planning knowledge. I think that work done in lexical semantics, and in particular in its subfield of lexical decomposition, answers these two requirements. In <ref> [Shapiro, 1992, p.812-813] </ref>, Pustejovski characterizes lexical semantics as follows: The study of natural language semantics is the investigation of how and what linguistic utterances denote. The subdiscipline of lexical semantics, then, can be seen as the study of how and what the words in a language denote. <p> Within lexical semantics, work on lexical decomposition is the closest to my concern of providing a principled representation for action verbs. Fass and Pustejovsky in <ref> [Shapiro, 1992, p.806] </ref> note that lexical decomposition is that branch of lexical semantics concerned with the internal semantic structure of lexical and conceptual items within a lexicon. <p> A comment before introducing the notation and some minor modifications to the theory as presented in [White, 1992], and applying it to the representation of the clause Go into the kitchen. According to Fass and Pustejovski in <ref> [Shapiro, 1992, p.808-809] </ref>, Jackendoff believes in the cognitive primacy of the primitives used within his system, and the role of these primitives in performing inferences. <p> Spatial and Possessional, are intended to capture the similarities between sentences like Jack went into the kitchen and The gift went to Bill , as shown in (6.8) below: (6.8a) [GO Sp ([jack], [TO ([IN ([kitchen])])])] (6.8b) [GO Poss ([gift], [TO ([AT ([bill])])])] In fact, in Fass and Pustejovsky's words <ref> [Shapiro, 1992, p.809] </ref> Jackendoff ... explores the idea that the predicates within the spatial domain may be used to analyze concepts within other semantic domains.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between BASIC-RECIPE and NON-BASIC-RECIPE is due to the fact that basic-act-types are considered as primitives at this level of representation, and they don't have hierarchical decomposition | I take here advantage of the AnimNL system, that will provide the necessary decomposition in lower level actions <ref> [Webber et al., 1992; Levison, 1993] </ref>. It is a notorious difficult problem to define what a basic act-type is, as I already mentioned in Sec. 5.1.3. <p> Note that I make the same assumption made in AnimNL, namely, that instructional text is processed in steps <ref> [Webber et al., 1992, p.5] </ref>: Instructions are given to AnimNL in steps consisting of one or more utterances. ... While there are no firm guidelines as to what a single instruction step should encompass, often steps are organized around small coherent substasks (such as adjusting a switch). <p> Thus agents have to open doors, lids, etc., to explore other spaces. Within the active space, we make the simplified assumption that agents can see everything up to closed portals. <ref> [Webber et al., 1992] </ref> Further, notice that the inferences about object locations are in a sense secondary, the primary inference being as follows: if one executes an action ff that changes H's perceptual space, and / or the space that is accessible to H, and ff either enables fi, or is

Reference-contexts: A comment before introducing the notation and some minor modifications to the theory as presented in <ref> [White, 1992] </ref>, and applying it to the representation of the clause Go into the kitchen. According to Fass and Pustejovski in [Shapiro, 1992, p.808-809], Jackendoff believes in the cognitive primacy of the primitives used within his system, and the role of these primitives in performing inferences. <p> To complete the representation of Go into the kitchen, it remains only to add the conceptual function GO: Thing fi Path ! Event: (6.6) [ Event GO ([you] i , m)] [ Path TO ([IN ([kitchen])])] m To distinguish Walk into the other room from (6.6), <ref> [White, 1992] </ref> adds an indication of manner to the basic representation: 9 (6.7) GO (i; m) [ Manner walking] # White's final addition to Jackendoff 's theory is a new semantic field. <p> The conceptual atom fill, introduced by <ref> [White, 1992] </ref>, serves as a pointer to semantic information not captured by the decomposition. 10 Finally, AT-END-OF is another Place function introduced in [Jackendoff, 1990]. This representation makes evident features that are not explicit in the given sentence, such as where the fuel cap has to be removed from. <p> Both will benefit from this integration. Defining terms in the T-Box by means of linguistically sound primitives will transform the T-Box into a real lexicon, or at least, into a Knowledge Base onto which the logical form produced by the parser can be easily mapped to | see <ref> [White, 1992] </ref> on the reasons why CS is particularly suitable as the logical form produced by a parser based on the Combinatory Categorial Grammar formalism [Steedman, 1990; Steedman, 1991]. <p> The algorithm is embedded in the AnimNL system described in Appendix D [Webber et al., 1991; Webber et al., 1992; Webber et al., 1993], and assumes the existence of separate AnimNL modules for 1. parsing the input and providing a logical form expressed in terms of Conceptual Structures primitives <ref> [White, 1992] </ref>; 2. managing the discourse model and solving anaphora. 1 The plan graph, whose data structure I will describe in Sec. 7.1.7, should be thought as representing the structure of H's beliefs and intentions. <p> The Logical Form of the input sentence is produced by the parser described in <ref> [White, 1992] </ref>, and expressed in terms of Conceptual Structures. The content of each clause, which I take to be an action description, is reified; therefore there is one "major" CS component for each clause expressed in the sentence, plus the necessary connectives.

Reference-contexts: In Figs. 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, I present part of the T-Box that I have implemented in CLASSIC [Brachman et al., 1991] and whose complete CLASSIC version the reader can find in Appendix C. The graphical conventions are as follows (adapted from <ref> [Woods and Schmolze, 1991, p.9] </ref>. Concepts are represented by ellipses and roles are represented by small circles containing inscribed squares. Attached to roles are value restrictions and other role "facets" (e.g., names and number restrictions), and attached to concepts are roles and structural conditions, i.e. SAME-AS constraints. <p> In the literature on hybrid systems, there is a constant debate on the trade-off between expressive power of the terminological and / or assertional languages and the computational tractability of the relevant algorithms. <ref> [Woods and Schmolze, 1991, p.34-35] </ref> notes that [Brachman et al., 1983a] made initial arguments, and [Brachman and Levesque, 1984] later made stronger arguments that the answers given by a KR system should be fully correct with respect to a formal semantics and that the operations should be performed in a predictable

Reference-contexts: In particular, Fig. 6.5 shows part of the recipe hierarchy, while Fig. 6.6 shows some auxiliary concept definitions, such as annotation-type, and a small portion of the state hierarchy. No SAME-AS relation is shown.
