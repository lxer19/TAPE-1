Abstract: We address the problem of estimating 3-d space occupancy using video imagery in the context of mobile robotics. A stationary robot observes a cluttered scene from a single viewpoint, and a second robot illuminates the scene from a sequence of directions thus producing a sequence of grey-level images. Differences of successive images are used to compute a sequence of shadowimages. The problem is to compute free space and occupied space from these shad-owimages. Solutions to this problem are known for the special case of terrain scenes. We generalize these solutions to non-terrain scenes by making two key observations. First, there is a subset constraint on the shadowimages of a non-terrain scene, which allows the visible surfaces of a non-terrain scene to be recovered by a terrain-based technique. Second, the remaining regions of the shadowimages provide a conservative estimate of the occupied space hidden by these visible surfaces.

Reference-contexts: For a point x in a scene, let V (x) H src denote the set of directions, called the visibility field at x <ref> [6] </ref>, in which the source is visible from x. In particular, let V surf (x) denote the restriction of the visibility field to points on the visible surfaces. Observe that the surface visibility field, V surf (x), corresponds exactly to the un-shadowed region of a shadowgram.
