Abstract: As networking technology brings us into the information age, 3D and multimedia applications become more prevalent and the emerging norm. Improvements in communication infrastructure also allow us to explore the realm of group interaction and collaboration over the information superhighway. Our work focuses on providing a small group of geographically distributed scientists the means of sharing their data and interactively creating visualizations and analyzing them. This allows for shorter turn around time compared to more traditional means which in turn allows for greater research productivity. The key features of our system include: different levels of information sharing, incremental updates to reduce network traffic, an intuitive floor control strategy for coordinating access to shared resources, a built in session manager to handle participants who either join late or leave early, and a host of collaborative 3D visualization aids. An added feature is that while the system is designed for small group collaborations, it can also be used for briefing a larger audience. These features are included in the CSpray collaborative 3D visualization system.

Reference-contexts: There are many excellent examples of group collaboration dealing with networking issues to human interaction issues that are reported in books such as Groupware <ref> [1] </ref> and in proceedings such as Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Human factors in computing systems (CHI), and Graphics Interface. However, only a handful deal directly with issues associated with distributed and collaborative 3D visualization. We discuss some recent work in this focus area below.

NPSNET <ref> [2] </ref> uses IP multicast to manage very large distributed battle simulations over the Internet. This is achieved by partitioning the virtual battle field based on spatial and temporal proximity as well as functionally related entities. DEDICATED [3] is a distributed heterogeneous multimedia learning environment with a device-independent and application-independent architecture.

Reference-contexts: We also had opportunity to use CSpray in educational settings which provides a more accurate assessment of its effectiveness. In the REINAS project <ref> [9] </ref>, we work with faculty members from the meteorology and oceanography departments at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). NPS has a teaching laboratory of Silicon Graphics workstations, in which they used CSpray to demonstrate the features of the current day's data.

Reference-contexts: Regional research in oceanography is supported through visualization of real-time collected ocean data. Work on how to visualize uncertainty in such ocean data has also resulted from this collaboration <ref> [10] </ref>. Other related research projects have spun off from CSpray, including compression research. Because of the slower bandwidth links used to connect through the Internet, savings achieved through compression can be substantial.

Reference-contexts: Because of the slower bandwidth links used to connect through the Internet, savings achieved through compression can be substantial. We have investigated the compression of frames of images to be communicated, and traded this off to the compression of the visualization primitives themselves. Currently an active area of research <ref> [11] </ref>, the compression and transmission of geometric primitives is important for fast inexpensive collaborative scientific visualization. For a summary of compression efforts related to CSpray, see [12]. Currently, the collaboration layer in CSpray is tightly coupled with the rest of the visualization system.
