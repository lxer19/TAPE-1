Abstract: One method of speeding up traditional engineering activities is by introducing parallel development paths. Although cycle time is reduced, coordination and project documentation become more difficult and are further exacerbated by synchronous collaboration. These needs can be addressed by capturing, accessing, and reusing knowledge consisting of the design, together with its rationale and development history. Successful capturing of design knowledge includes these elements and answers to several questions: What is the design? How was the design achieved? Why were choices made? This paper describes how to capture the history of the informal phase of the specification and design process using the Collaborative Environment for Concurrent Engineering Design (CECED) 1 .

Reference-contexts: Our current choice for automated process capture is X events, which do not easily translate into segments of the design suitable for design reuse. We are investigating the development of a dialog manager <ref> [CRAI-92] </ref> that will give us more compact representations of the semantics of user interactions with the design tools. The objective of the dialog manager design will again be to minimize the recoding necessary in the (VLSI) design tools. 4.
