Reference-contexts: Tracking which is a central component in temporal registration has been addressed by using lines [15, 4, 16], edges [10, 20] including edge contours [5, 13] and intensity [18, 11, 17] including optic flow <ref> [1] </ref>. For example Crowley [4] used a set of parameterized line tokens which were matched using the Mahalanobis distance with predicted feature vectors. Sawhney [16] extended this approach to triples of lines, grouped under the shallow structure assumption under affine transformations. These techniques however are slow. <p> These techniques however are slow. Other model-based tracking such as [11] uses a hierarchy of features to represent a model. Constraints on the state of the feature are propagated down the hierarchy and at the lowest level tracking is accomplished using convolutions (edges) or SSD methods <ref> [1] </ref>. Hager does not explicitly address the issue of mismatches as is done by Shi and Tomasi [17]. Affine feature dissimilarity over multiple frames is used to identify good features to track. This method is image based, while ours is model based and can detect outliers after just one frame.

Reference-contexts: Under these assumptions the correlation measure is normalized in that it is independent of the illumination incident on the surface. However, good experimental results have been obtained with this measure on surfaces that do not under 2D feature rotation fit the Lambertian assumption (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a derivation and [7] for experiments with this measure). Normalized cross-correlation degrades when there is a relative rotation between the templates and image patches.

To compensate for 2D rotations it is sufficient to note that equation 1 is linear shift invariant in cartesian space and hence is translation invariant.

Reference-contexts: A feature template is defined as a pair ht; t i where t is an image patch centered over a dominant image edge and t * [; ] is the phase of the maximum response of a steered Gaussian derivative filter <ref> [9] </ref> with the edge at the patch center. Templates are then localized within a search window fl in a new image as follows: 1. Spatial gradients and their orientations are computed by filtering fl with steerable Gaussian derivative filters and suppressing non-maximal edges within the search window. 2. <p> The advantage of using steerable filters is that they can be represented as a set of basis filters from which an arbitrary orientation of a template can be estimated <ref> [9] </ref>. For edges, first derivatives of Gaussian masks can be used. Their performance is better than that of box filters, for example, when there are non-step edges.

Reference-contexts: So long as the actual feature is within the search window, un-occluded and free from specular reflections in the image, the tracker locates features correctly.

Kumar's algorithm is an iterative approach that minimizes the squared image-plane distance from the data points to the projected model points. <p> The third source of variance is pose computation error. As shown in simulation studies by Kumar <ref> [14] </ref>, the residual pose error resulting from simple noise in the positions of point features is very small for most images.

A second extension to the project is the automatic extraction of feature templates. Tomasi's work lays a basis for measuring feature dissimilarity over small frames of motion <ref> [17] </ref>. Small dissimilarities over a range of motion typically yield a good feature. This work is currently under examination. Finally alternative techniques such as M-estimation that provide a faster computation and yet are robust statistical methods need to be examined for pose computation.
