Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 293 Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Jerusalem, Israel, October 9-13, 1994 Abstract One of the fundamental challenges in pattern recognition is choosing a set of features appropriate to a class of problems. In applications such as image retrieval, it is important that features used by the system in pattern comparison provide good measures of "perceptual similarity." We present here a new set of features and an image model based on the three mutually orthogonal components produced by the 2-D Wold decomposition of random fields. These components have visual properties which approximate the three most important perceptual dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented here is different from the existing Wold-based models in that it tolerates certain local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and reduces computation for comparison of patterns subjected to transformations such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. The effectiveness of the new Wold features for retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated by comparing it to that of other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity.

Reference-contexts: To build such a system, it is important that the features used for pattern recognition are faithful to those used by humans in comparing patterns. A human texture perception study conducted by Rao and Lohse <ref> [1] </ref> indicated that the three most important perceptual dimensions in natural texture discrimination can be described as "repetitiveness", "directionality", and "granularity and complexity". <p> However, when the harmonic components are significant, they usually dominate the perceptual pattern discrimination. By Rao and Lohse <ref> [1] </ref>, the existence of periodic structure is the strongest perceptual cue in texture discrimination. The distinct spectral signatures of some textures from the Brodatz database are shown in Figure 1. The reptile skin in (a) has a prominent harmonic component. <p> However, when the initial stage indicates that the harmonic information is sufficient for the pattern comparison, this operation can be avoided and results in substantial savings. Furthermore, consideration of first the harmonic component and then the other Wold components is consistent with the perceptual saliency of these components <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 Experiments The retrieval experiments are carried out on the Brodatz texture database using the Photobook test environment described in [14].

Reference-contexts: The Wold model implementations in the literature were not designed to meet these requirements; therefore, a new implementation is necessary. The Wold model implementations reported to date take one of two approaches. One is Lebesgue decomposition <ref> [2] </ref> [3], and the other is direct maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation [10]. Compared to the ML method, the algorithms based on Lebesgue decomposition are computa-tionally more efficient. Also, Fourier spectral analysis has the advantage of being shift-invariant; humans, too, are relatively insensitive to shifts in a texture.

The orthogonality of the two components allows them to be treated separately. 2.2 Approximations To apply the 2-D Wold decomposition theory to texture modeling, Francos et al. made some approximations on the deterministic random field <ref> [5] </ref>. A half-plane deterministic field is approximated by a harmonic random field which in the spectral domain appears as the 2-D Dirac ffi-functions supported by discrete points. The spectral distribution function of an evanescent field is absolutely continuous in one dimension and singular in the orthogonal dimension.

Reference-contexts: For all the experiments in this paper, we used the "Bro-datz texture database" which contains 1008 natural texture patches cropped from all 112 pictures in the Bro-datz Album <ref> [11] </ref>. Each Brodatz texture provides nine 128 fi 128 subimages in 8-bit gray levels. This collection contains a large variety of natural textures, including the many inhomogeneous Brodatz textures which are not usu ally included in texture studies.

Reference-contexts: Various AR implementations have been used in texture modeling. In this work, we use the multiscale second order symmetric SAR model of Mao and Jain <ref> [12] </ref>. At each of the second, third, and fourth scales, four SAR coefficients are estimated by the least squares error method. These coefficients and the estimation error compose a five-parameter vector. The vectors from three scales are cascaded to form a fifteen-parameter SAR feature vector of each image.

Reference-contexts: The evanescent information is described here as the dominant orientations of an image. These orientations are found by using a basis set of oriented bandpass filters and a decision process based on thresholding orientation histograms <ref> [13] </ref>. The Wold feature set of a texture without prominent harmonic component is composed of the SAR features and the number of dominant orientations in the image.
