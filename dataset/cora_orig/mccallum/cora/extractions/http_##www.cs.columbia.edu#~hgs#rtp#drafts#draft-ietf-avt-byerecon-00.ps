Reference-contexts: To resolve the BYE flood problem, we propose a BYE reconsideration mechanism. To help alleviate premature timeouts, we propose a reverse timer reconsideration algorithm. Both algorithms are simple, and require minimal state and computation. 2 Introduction Recently, a number of problems related to RTP <ref> [1] </ref> scalability to large multicast groups have been identified [2]. The most serious of these problems is RTCP congestion in simultaneous joins. In this scenario, a large number of users join a session at nearly the same time. <p> This implies that each user will not see the other users, which is undesirable for the post-class discussion scenario just mentioned. 4.1 Quantifying the Problem The difficulty is related to the way timeouts are handled. In the current specification <ref> [1] </ref>, a user is timed out if they have not sent an RTP or RTCP packet within the last five RTCP intervals. In dynamic groups, the interval itself is dynamic. As many users leave a group, their BYE packets cause the group size estimate to rapidly decrease.

Reference-contexts: The most serious of these problems is RTCP congestion in simultaneous joins. In this scenario, a large number of users join a session at nearly the same time. This can happen if the join is an automatic response to an announced session on the mbone <ref> [3] </ref>, or if RTP is being used for broadcast applications, and a popular show comes on. When this happens, each user joins the group believing that they are the only user. They then send their initial RTCP packets within a short period of time, causing a flood of RTCP reports.

Reference-contexts: This can result in network and/or access link congestion. For modem dial-in users, the slow access links can cause congestion even with moderate simultaneous joins. To combat this problem, an algorithm called reconsideration has been proposed <ref> [4] </ref> [5]. This algorithm causes backoff in the transmission of RTCP packets as group sizes increase. However, several new problems have recently been discovered relating to RTCP scalability. These difficulties are similar to the step-join congestion problem, but different in that they require additional algorithms to resolve.

Reference-contexts: Users can be expected to leave a group simultaneously for much the same reasons they might join simultaneously an automatic leave as a result of the end of the session (as indicated in the SDP <ref> [6] </ref> announcement for the session), or because the "show" is over, and the users manually exit their applications. A number of aspects of the BYE flood problem make it different than the simultaneous join problem. These must be taken into consideration when designing an algorithm to reduce the flood.
