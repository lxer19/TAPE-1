Title: Towards a Principled Representation of Discourse Plans  
Author: R. Michael Young Johanna D. Moore Martha E. Pollack 
Abstract: ISP Technical Report 94-2 May 1994 Abstract We argue that discourse plans must capture the intended causal and decompositional relations between communicative actions. We present a planning algorithm, DPOCL, that builds plan structures that properly capture these relations, and show how these structures are used to solve the problems that plagued previous discourse planners, and allow a system to participate effectively and flexibly in an ongoing dialogue. A version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, Atlanta, GA, 1994.

Reference-contexts: The action operator captures the action's preconditions and effects. These preconditions and effects are sets of first-order quantified sentences similar to the typical precondition and add/delete lists of STRIPS <ref> (Fikes and Nilsson, 1971) </ref>. Each decomposition operator represents a single-layer expansion of a composite step, essentially providing a partial specification for the subplan that achieves the parent step's effects given its preconditions.

Reference-contexts: Previous Approaches Discourse is typically viewed as having a hierarchical structure and therefore many discourse planners are based on the original NOAH <ref> (Sacerdoti, 1977) </ref> model of hierarchical planning (Appelt, 1985; Cawsey, 1993; Hovy, 1991; Maybury, 1992; Moore and Paris, 1993). These systems rely on customized planning algorithms with procedural semantics for the purposes of solving specific text-planning problems.

Reference-contexts: We then show how more recent planning algorithms, called partial-order causal link (POCL) planners (McAllister and Rosenblitt, 1991; Penberthy and Weld, 1991), can be used to generate discourse plans. The particular planning algorithm we use is DPOCL, an algorithm that introduces action decomposition into a POCL framework <ref> (Young, Pollack and Moore, 1994) </ref>. <p> Figure 4 summarizes the DPOCL planning algorithm. For more details of the algorithm and a discussion of its formal properties, see <ref> (Young, Pollack and Moore, 1994) </ref>. The representation of each action is separated into two parts corresponding to the causal and decompositional roles the action plays: the action operator, and a possibly empty set of decomposition operators. The action operator captures the action's preconditions and effects. <p> Conclusions In this paper, we have presented a structure for discourse plans that draws on state-of-the-art AI planning research. Both the plan representation and the discourse planning algorithm that we use to construct it have a well-defined semantics whose formal properties can be analyzed <ref> (Young, Pollack and Moore, 1994) </ref>. Further, we have shown how DPOCL discourse plan structures can be used for determining appropriate responses to utterances that indicate a failure of some part of the discourse plan.
