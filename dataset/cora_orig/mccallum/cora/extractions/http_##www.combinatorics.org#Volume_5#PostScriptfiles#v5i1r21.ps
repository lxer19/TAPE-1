Abstract: Using Zeilberger's factorization of two-stack-sortable permutations, we write a functional equation | of a strange sort | that defines their generating function according to five statistics: length, number of descents, number of right-to-left and left-to-right maxima, and a fifth statistic that is closely linked to the factorization. Then, we show how one can translate this functional equation into a polynomial one. We thus prove that our five-variable generating function for two-stack-sortable permutations is algebraic of degree 20.

Reference-contexts: We believe that our method can be applied to, or at least inspire, the solution of other functional equations having similar features.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The aim of this paper is twofold. Our first intention is to draw attention on the factorization of two-stack-sortable permutations described by Zeilberger in <ref> [22] </ref>. Among other advantages, this factorization preserves many standard statistics defined on permutations, and hence, constitutes an efficient first step for their enumeration. We thus obtain a functional equation | of a strange kind | that defines a five-variable generating function for these permutations (see Eq. (1)). <p> In particular, he conjectured [21] that the number of two-stack sortable permutations of length n, i.e. of permutations such that T 2 () = 12 : : : n, is 2 (3n)!=((2n + 1)!(n + 1)!). This conjecture was first proved by Zeilberger: in <ref> [22] </ref>, he describes a clever factorization of these permutations that gives a functional equation for their generating function; then, he solves this equation via a very complicated method that we will simplify below. <p> By convention, the "empty" permutation is given the weight v. We shall not prove the following proposition, as it is a direct consequence of Zeilberger's factorization <ref> [22] </ref>. Proposition 1.1 Let (x; z; u; v; t) be the generating function for two-stack sortable permutations. <p> Most combinatorialists probably think they have a better knowledge of a series when they know it satisfies a differential or algebraic equation. In this particular case, it is known <ref> [22] </ref> that the length generating function for two-stack-sortable permutations, in other words (x; 1; 1; 1; 1), is cubic over IR (x). <p> Can we derive this information from (1)? Other partial results, like the expansions of (x; z; 1; 1; 1) and (x; 1; u; 1; 1) [8], or the algebraic equation (of degree 6) satisfied by (x; 1; 1; 1; t) <ref> [22] </ref>, suggest that the complete generating function (x; z; u; v; t) could be algebraic over IR (x; z; u; v; t), but Eq. (1) does not permit to prove this immediately. <p> The quadratic method and Zeilberger's result (z = u = v = 1) The two-variable generating function (x; 1; 1; 1; t) = Z (x; t) satisfies Z (x; t) = 1 xt 1 t Z (x; 1) tZ (x; t) This is exactly the equation established by Zeilberger in <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> If the recurrence relation (7) had not been of order 1, we could still have looked for its hypergeometric solutions via Petkovsek's algorithm [17]. 2. The expression of Z (x; 1) was first conjectured by West [20], then proved by Zeilberger <ref> [22] </ref>, Dulucq, Gire and Guibert [8], and finally Goulden and West [14]. Zeilberger solves (2) by first guessing Eq. (6), and then checking that (6) and (2) have a common solution.
