Abstract: A mobile ad hoc network consists of wireless hosts that may move often. Movement of hosts results in a change in routes, requiring some mechanism for determining new routes. Several routing protocols have already been proposed for ad hoc networks. This report suggests an approach to utilize location information (for instance, obtained using the global positioning system) to improve performance of routing protocols for ad hoc networks. By using location information, the proposed Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocols limit the search for a new route to a smaller "request zone" of the ad hoc network. This results in a significant reduction in the number of routing messages. We present two algorithms to determine the request zone, and also suggest potential optimizations to our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The existing MANET routing algorithms do not take into account the physical location of a destination node. In this report, we propose two algorithms to reduce route discovery overhead using location information. Similar ideas have been applied to develop selective paging for cellular PCS (Personal Communication Service) networks <ref> [1] </ref>. In selective paging, the system pages a selected subset of cells close to the last reported location of a mobile host. This allows the location tracking cost to be decreased. We propose and evaluate an analogous approach for routing in MANET.

Reference-contexts: In this report, we suggest an approach to decrease overhead of route discovery by utilizing location information for mobile hosts. Such location information may be obtained using the global positioning system (GPS) <ref> [7, 14] </ref>. We demonstrate how location information may be used by means of two Location-Aided Routing (LAR) protocols for route discovery.

We propose and evaluate an analogous approach for routing in MANET. In a survey of potential applications of GPS, Dommety and Jain <ref> [7] </ref> briefly suggest use of location information in ad hoc networks, though they do not elaborate on how the information may be used. Other researchers have also suggested that location information should be used to improve (qualitatively or quantitatively) performance of a mobile computing system [17, 19]. <p> Location information used in the LAR protocol may be provided 3 by the Global Positioning System (GPS) <ref> [7, 14] </ref>.

In reality, position information provided by GPS includes some amount of error, which is the difference between GPS-calculated coordinates and the real coordinates.

Since in our simulation, we assume that the mobile nodes do not pause between moves, with this mobility model, the routing overhead for any scheme would be higher, as compared to results reported in other papers (for instance, <ref> [11] </ref>) that assume pauses between consecutive moves. 4.2 Simulation Results Initially, we assume that a node knows its current location accurately, without any error. At the end of this section, we briefly consider the impact of location error on performance of our algorithms.
