Abstract: CSPL TECH. REPORT 307, MAR. 1997 1 Abstract We introduce methods for detection and classification of noise contaminated patterns which are based on performing subspace decomposition on a matrix of higher order spatial moments. The subspace decomposition permits signal-alone moments to be recovered from signal-plus-noise observations arising from an unknown mixture distribution. The methods use normalized power moments and normalized factorial moments as pattern descriptors. While the set of L-th order factorial moments are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of L-th order power moments, digital computation of factorial moments is more numerically stable permitting a larger number of moments to be utilized. We illustrate these methods for wordspotting in automatic processing of documents, and for digital modulation classification in communications.

Reference-contexts: via Eigendecomposition Let f s (x; y) and f n (x; y) be two probability densities and consider the case where the observations X; Y are generated by the additive mixture model f (x; y) = fif s (x; y) + (1 fi)f n (x; y); (7) where fi 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The mixture model arises in many applications [18], [19], [20]. Typically the density f n (x; y) is a known "nominal" or "noise" density, f s (x; y) is an unknown "signal" density of interest, and fi plays the role of a proportional signal-to-noise ratio. <p> A. Scaling the Power Moment Matrix When X and Y are contained in the interval [x min ; x max ] and [y min ; y max ], respectively, we can improve conditioning of C by centering and scaling X and Y into the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. This forces C ij = 0 for all odd off-diagonal entries (i + j odd integer) and all other entries to be bounded in magnitude by 1. By making C more sparse its upper triangular Cholesky decomposition inherits sparseness and becomes better conditioned, see Fig. 1. <p> A. Wordspotting Example Given a group of documents, it is frequently desirable to know whether any of the documents contain a certain word or set of words [21], <ref> [1] </ref>. It would be useful if this process could be automated and work reliably on documents with different fonts, font sizes, and noise contamination, e.g. in faxed doc uments. here we illustrate the moment matrix methodology for a simple wordspotting example. <p> This can be explained by the fact that, as the variables x = (r; ; z) are prenormalized to the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the higher order moments pairs E [r p e jq ], E [e jq z s ] and E [r p z s ] are exponentially decreasing to zero as p; q; s become large. <p> They are positive definite for x &gt; 0. Proof: The case s = 0 is quickly disposed of since for this case A (x; s) reduces to the outer product U U T where U = <ref> [1; x; : : : ; x L ] </ref> T . When x = 0, A (x; s) is non-negative definite since it is a matrix of zeros except for a 1 at the (1; 1) element. We henceforth assume x; s &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Note that the use of more moments in the raw moment discriminant D1 actually degrades discrimination performance. This is consistent with the well known variance increase in estimation of higher order statistics as the order increases <ref> [22] </ref>. Interestingly, the opposite trend is observed in the whitened moment discriminant D3 where variance reduction has been acheived in the higher order moments via the subspace eigendecomposition of the raw 37 fi 37 moment matrix.
