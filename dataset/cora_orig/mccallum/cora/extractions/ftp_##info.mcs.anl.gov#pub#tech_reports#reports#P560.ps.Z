Abstract: This paper describes a suite of codes as well as associated testing and timing drivers for computing rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorizations of dense matrices. The main contribution is an efficient block algorithm for approximating an RRQR factorization, employing a windowed version of the commonly used Golub pivoting strategy and improved versions of the RRQR algorithms for triangular matrices originally suggested by Chandrasekaran and Ipsen and by Pan and Tang, respectively. We highlight usage and features of these codes and give an example of their use in the context of solving rank-deficient least-squares systems. Given a m fi n matrix A with singular values oe 1 oe 2 : : : oe n 0 and a threshold o , we define the numerical rank r of A through the smallest singular value oe r that satisfies oe r oe 1 =o . That is, if there is a reasonable gap between oe r and oe r+1 , and oe r+1 is small, it makes sense to consider A to numerically have rank r. Our goal is to compute a QR factorization This work was supported by the Applied and Computational Mathematics Program, Advanced Research Projects Agency, under contracts DM28E04120 and P-95006.
