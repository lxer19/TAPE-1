Title: Translation Analysis and Translation Automation  
Abstract: We argue that the concept of translation analysis provides a suitable foundation for a new generation of translation support tools. We show that pre-existing translations can be analyzed into a structured translation memory and describe our TransSearch bilingual concordancing system, which allows translators to harness such a memory. We claim that translation analyzers can help detect translation errors in draft translations and we present the results of an experiment on the detection of deceptive cognates conducted as part of our TransCheck project. Finally, we claim that translation analysis can facilitate the speech-to-text tran scription of dictated translations and introduce our new TransTalk project.

Reference-contexts: There the question arises: Which parts of the process should be given to a human partner? (Bar-Hillel <ref> [1] </ref>, p. 230) Forty-two years and three generations of systems later, pure MT is not more widely applicable than it was then (1) . More discouraging still, neither is mixed MT.

Reference-contexts: This equation is strongly reminiscent of the fundamental formula of statistical speech-recognition (Bahl & al <ref> [2] </ref>): where the distributions p (s | f) and p (f) are known as the acoustic model and language model respectively. <p> The main advantage of this approach is that, for each source sentence e, the conditional language model in effect reduces to a simple Hidden Markov Model , and the translation dictation problem then takes the form familiar in speech-recognition: for which powerful search techniques are available (Bahl & al <ref> [2] </ref>). 6. Conclusions A new generation of translation support tools is just around the corner. Thanks to the development of translation analysis techniques, translator's workstations will soon be able to offer much more to their users than mere office automation functions.

Reference-contexts: This difference stems from the practical requirements that different tasks (MT versus translation analysis) impose on the level of precision in the formal characterization of tr L1,L2 (S,T). Consider for example the model that underlies the sentence alignment method proposed by Brown & al. <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It seems reasonable to hope that a weak translation model could make this composition available to the speech recognizer. This idea was independently advanced by Dymetman, Foster & Isabelle [9] and by Brown & al. <ref> [4] </ref>. We have launched a joint project with the speech-recognition group at CRIM (Centre de Recherche Informatique de Montral), the TransTalk project, aimed at proving the feasibility of the approach, using English as the source language and French as the dictation language. <p> Brown et al. <ref> [4] </ref> report the results of an experiment with the Hansards, using one of their simpler translation models (from French to English, in their case), which show the per-word perplexity of their pure (English) language model to average 63.3, while the perplexity of their conditional language model drops to an average of

Reference-contexts: The first family of parameters can be estimated reliably on a sufficiently large French corpus, while the second family of parameters, depending on e, can be estimated if certain simplifying assumptions akin to the Translation Model 1 of Brown & al. <ref> [5] </ref> are made. Basically, each is considered to be the average of the contributions made by each English word w e in e to the probability of realis ing part-of-speech POS i as the French word w f . <p> In order to estimate the parameters , it is necessary to have a pre-aligned training corpus of English-French bitexts (see section 3). It is then possible to start with initial guesses for the parameters, and use standard reestimation techniques (see <ref> [5] </ref>) on this training corpus to maximize the predictive power of these parameters, while holding grammatical parameters fixed.

Reference-contexts: It has already been suggested that a tool capable of producing bilingual concordances would be useful to bilingual lexicographers (see for example Church & Gale <ref> [6] </ref>). It is rather obvious that bilingual concordancing would also be useful to translators.

Reference-contexts: A reversible MT system (see for example Dymetman [8], Van Noord [21]) can in addition compute, for any value of T, the values S for which &lt;S,T&gt; belongs to tr L1,L2 . While MT systems deal with the problem of producing translations, we can also, as noted by Debili <ref> [7] </ref>, view translations from a recognition perspective. We will call a translation acceptor any procedure which, given some particular pair &lt;S,T&gt;, can decide whether or not tr L1,L2 (S,T) holds.

Reference-contexts: An ordinary MT system embodies some (possibly partial) specification of a translation relation tr L1,L2 , together with a procedure which, given any value of S, will return one or several values T such that &lt;S,T&gt; belongs to tr L1,L2 . A reversible MT system (see for example Dymetman <ref> [8] </ref>, Van Noord [21]) can in addition compute, for any value of T, the values S for which &lt;S,T&gt; belongs to tr L1,L2 . While MT systems deal with the problem of producing translations, we can also, as noted by Debili [7], view translations from a recognition perspective.

Reference-contexts: It seems reasonable to hope that a weak translation model could make this composition available to the speech recognizer. This idea was independently advanced by Dymetman, Foster & Isabelle <ref> [9] </ref> and by Brown & al. [4]. We have launched a joint project with the speech-recognition group at CRIM (Centre de Recherche Informatique de Montral), the TransTalk project, aimed at proving the feasibility of the approach, using English as the source language and French as the dictation language. <p> a division of work between p (f), responsible for the well-formedness of French sentences, and p (e|f), responsible for pairing between English and French sentences (hence the somewhat misleading terminology translation model) without much regard for either the internal structure of French or the internal structure of English (4) (see <ref> [9] </ref> for details). The method has, however, one important shortcoming in terms of processing: it requires an extensive search among the sentences f in order to maximize p (e|f) p (f) (not counting the p (s|f) factor, which only makes matters worse).

Reference-contexts: Given these figures, POS tagging was obviously called for. The translation analyzer was therefore replaced with a new one, TA2, that differed from TA1 only in that its two language models were augmented with the POS tagger of Foster <ref> [10] </ref>. The search process was modified so as to take into account POS information associated with our 145 pairs of DCs. This scheme produced much better results, as shown in Tables 3 and 4. <p> One possibility that we are currently investigating is to adapt a language model proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>. This model is a kind of tri-POS hidden Markov model, depending on two families of parameters. The first family gives the probability of generating a word having part-of-speech POS k , given that words with parts-of-speech POS i and POS j have been previously generated.

Reference-contexts: One invaluable addition to the translators workstation would be an automatic dictation module: many professional translators prefer to dictate their translations rather than doing the typing themselves (Gurstein & Monette <ref> [11] </ref>). At the present time, speech-recognition technology is severely limited when confronted with large-vocabularies, and is therefore inapplicable to the task of most translators. An intriguing possibility, however, is that of teaming the speech-recognition module with a (weak) translation model.

Reference-contexts: In any case, the market response to this kind of man/machine modus vivendi has consistently been less than enthusiastic. (1) Though it has been shown that MT can be remarkably successful in the rather marginal case of some extremely narrow sublanguages like weather bulletins (Isabelle <ref> [12] </ref>). -2--It has become obvious that, generally speaking, machines still cannot successfully assume control over the core part of the translation process.

Reference-contexts: A TAT makes explicit the -3--compositional makeup of the translation relation. For example, given some suitable definition of the English-French translation relation, a translation analyzer could produce a TAT such as the one shown in Figure 1. Isabelle <ref> [13] </ref> uses the term bi-text to designate structures which, like TATs, are meant to decompose translations into their constituent correspondences. TATs are structural descriptors for translation analyses in the same way that parse trees are structural descriptors for grammatical analyses.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 is a general discussion of the notion of translation analysis. Sections 3, 4 and 5 describe our work on three applications: the translation memory, the translation checker and the translators dictation machine. 2. Translation Analysis In recent literature (e.g. Isabelle, Dymetman & Macklovitch <ref> [14] </ref>), translation is often conceptualized as a relation tr L1,L2 (S, T) whose extension is a set of pairs &lt;S,T&gt; such that S is a text of language L 1 and T is a text of language L 2 .

Reference-contexts: quantitative measure of this sharpening can be given in terms of perplexity, an information-theoretic quantity which measures the average uncertainty a given language model entertains about the next word to appear in a natural text, having seen the preceding words: the less the perplexity, the more predictive the model (Jelinek <ref> [15] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Bilingual concordancing would enable him/her to retrieve examples of these expressions together with their translations in a database of the TransBase kind. This could be useful not only for idiomatic expressions, but also for specialized terminology or domain-specific formulae (To whom it may concern..., Attendu que...). See Macklovitch <ref> [16] </ref> for a more detailed discussion of this issue. TransSearch is just such a tool: it allows one to extract occurrences of specific expressions from the database, and to visualize them within their bilingual context.

Reference-contexts: In its current incarnation, the CITIs workstation provides the translator with a windowing environment where he/she has simultaneous access to a number of tools such as split screen word processing, spelling correction, terminology and dictionary lookup, file comparison, word counting, full-text retrieval, etc. (Macklovitch <ref> [17] </ref>). Admittedly, this has more to do with office automation for translators than with translation automation per se. But following Kays proposed scenario, we can now take advantage of this computer base and progressively enrich it with translation-oriented tools.

Reference-contexts: This information is stored in two distinct language-specific components of the database, and indexed so as to allow rapid access to any part of the text. A correspondence analyzer based on the techniques described in Simard, Foster & Isabelle <ref> [20] </ref> then uses these language-specific analyses to construct a sentence-level translation map, which is also stored into the database. The structure and construction scheme of the database are illustrated in Figure 4. The texts of the source and target languages are handled symmetrically in the database. <p> The correspondence model used in TA1 is simply the sentence alignment program of Simard, Foster & Isabelle <ref> [20] </ref>.
