Abstract: Results on two-bit gate design for quantum computers Abstract We present numerical results which show how two-bit logic gates can be used in the design of a quantum computer. We show that the Toffoli gate, which is a universal gate for all classical reversible computation, can be implemented using a particular sequence of exactly five two-bit gates. An arbitrary three-bit unitary gate, which can be used to build up any arbitrary quantum computation, can be implemented exactly with six two-bit gates. The ease of implementation of any particular quantum operation is dependent upon a very non-classical feature of the operation, its exact quantum phase factor.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is legitimate to ask the following general question: Given an arbitrary desired computation U (2 n ) (i.e., arbitrary unitary operation on n bits), how may it be implemented by a sequence of quantum logic gates? Deutsch went most of the way towards answering this question in 1989 <ref> [6] </ref>, when he showed that just a single three-bit quantum logic gate is "universal", i.e., that a concatenation of this one gate applied in turn to different triplets of bits, could implement any U (2 n ). <p> Deutsch's work also had nothing to say about the efficiency of the implementation of the U (2 n ) computation by quantum gates, and it is this issue which we will address in the present paper. Indeed, his calculation <ref> [6] </ref> only showed that an infinite sequence of U (2 3 ) operations would be capable of approximating, to arbitrarily high accuracy, a desired U (2 n ); likewise, the recent proof of the universality of two-bit gates only shows that an infinite sequence of U (2 2 ) operations would <p> If for example, the matrices are invariant under a relabeling of bits 1 and 2, then (12123)=(21213). Conjugation by Swapping. The swapping of the states of any pair of bits is a special two-bit logic gate <ref> [6] </ref>, and this gate can be used to change the network topology. <p> We also find that for the (121) topology, other choices of phase factors in the matrix Eq. (5) besides Margolus' can be implemented.) To further illustrate the difficulty of achieving the desired phase in quantum gates, we investigated the two-bit implementation of perhaps the simplest possible three-bit gate, which Deutsch <ref> [6] </ref> calls "X": U = B B B @ 1 1 1 e i C C C A for which the state is unchanged except for the modification of one phase factor. It turns out that even this simple matrix is not very simple to implement with two-bit gates.

Reference-contexts: He did not address the question of whether there might be a two-bit quantum logic gate which is universal. It was widely suspected that there was not, because it was known that no set of two-bit gates was sufficient for another formal system, classical reversible computation. Toffoli <ref> [7] </ref> showed that for the classical problem, the minimal universal gate operates on three bits (this is now known as the Toffoli gate). <p> All classical reversible logic can be generated by the Toffoli gate <ref> [7] </ref>, U T = B B B 1 1 1 0 1 1 C C A so we have explored the minimal implementation of this U (8) element. Of course, from the preceding section we know that it is implementable with six gates in the (121212) topology.

Reference-contexts: Toffoli [7] showed that for the classical problem, the minimal universal gate operates on three bits (this is now known as the Toffoli gate). Nevertheless, recently one of us showed that Deutsch's three-bit gates could be created by a sequence of two-bit quantum gates <ref> [8] </ref> (Deutsch's work had never excluded this possibility). Deutsch's work also had nothing to say about the efficiency of the implementation of the U (2 n ) computation by quantum gates, and it is this issue which we will address in the present paper. <p> While purely numerical, our approach takes advantage of a set of analytic results which could be more generally useful, so we mention them now. 2.1 Notation and Constraints particular analytic equivalence discovered in Ref. <ref> [8] </ref>, between a particular three-bit gate designated "U " and a sequence of four two-bit gates (ignoring the two one-bit gates labeled "N" for the moment).

The horizontal lines in the figure may be taken to denote the world lines of the three bits (they may be spin-1/2 degrees of freedom in a physical implementation). <p> First, since the approach is purely numerical, no result in this paper can be taken as strictly proved, only strongly suggested. In <ref> [8] </ref> we proved, using the generator calculus of the Lie groups, that representation of any three-bit gate by a sequence of two-bit gates was possible, provided that arbitrarily many two-bit gates are permitted.

Reference-contexts: We will also present the corresponding results for three-bit gates of special importance. We show that the Toffoli gate also requires exactly five two-bit gates for its exact implementation, which is somewhat surprising given its simple form. It has recently been shown <ref> [11] </ref> that Toffoli and Fredkin gates, but with the wrong quantum phases, can be exactly implemented in just three two-bit gates. We will present a few other calculations illustrating more generally that the requirement of exact phase control [12] can substantially increase the complexity of implementation. <p> To illustrate this, we quote a result from N. Margolus <ref> [11] </ref> for the implementation of a slight modification of the Toffoli gate: U M = B B B 1 1 1 0 1 1 C C A which differs from U T only in that it changes the phase of the j1; 0; 1 &gt; component of the quantum state.

This routine is, of course, only capable of finding local minima, having no way to determine if the minimum is indeed global.

Reference-contexts: Thus, by the criterion of length of its two-gate implementation, the Toffoli gate is only slightly less complex that the general three-bit gate! Previously, the best known implementation of the Toffoli gate was a six-gate implementation of topology (121231) found by Coppersmith <ref> [16] </ref>. (We do not obtain the same matrices as Coppersmith when we study this topology numerically, which is indicative of a weakness of our approach: since there are many unneeded free parameters in the (121231) implementation, our procedure does not pick out the one with "simple" two-bit gates which Coppersmith found.)

Sleator and Weinfurter <ref> [17] </ref> have also recently shown a two-bit-gate implementation of U T ; while their implementation involves a greater number of gates, it respects the practical constraints involved in implementing unitary transformations in cavity QED, which of course have also not been considered here. 2.5 Results: Margolus' modification of Toffoli-the phase problem <p> A second weakness of the present approach is a more physical one: we assume that any arbitrary two-bit unitary operation is possible (see Eq. (2)). Whether this is true or not depends on the details of the physical implementation of the quantum system. As Ref. <ref> [17] </ref> illustrates, for any specific system (e.g., cavity QED) certain two-bit operations are much easier to implement that others.

Reference-contexts: It seems likely that in most circumstances where several different two-bit operations are easy to accomplish, that suitable concatenations of these operations can generate any arbitrary U (4); probably the most is known about this in the context of multiple-resonance NMR <ref> [18] </ref>. Still, no definite results have been obtained on this question yet, and it should be the subject of future study. It would also be sensible to include the ease of construction of particular classes of U (4) operations into our numerical optimizations.
