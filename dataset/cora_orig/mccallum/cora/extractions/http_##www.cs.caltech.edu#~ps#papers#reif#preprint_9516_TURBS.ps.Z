Abstract: We present a new approach to the construction of piecewise polynomial or rational C k -spline surfaces of arbitrary topological structure. The basic idea is to use exclusively parametric smoothness conditions, and to solve the well known problems at extraordinary points by admitting singular parametrizations. The smoothness of the spline surfaces is guaranteed by specifying a regular smooth re-parametrization explicitly. The resulting space of topologically unrestricted rational B-splines (TURBS) is linear and possesses a natural refinement property. Compared with all known methods the construction principle of TURBS is of striking simplicity and the required polynomial bi-degree is essentially decreased from O(k 2 ) to d = 2k + 2.

Reference-contexts: Besides the simplicity of the construction principle, the major benefit of this approach is the fact that the resulting spline spaces possess a natural refinement property. This important feature, which might give multi-scale methods access to surfaces of arbitrary topological genus, is discussed in [Rei93], [Rei94]. In <ref> [Boh95] </ref> the method of singular splines is generalized to C 2 -surfaces and the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing geometric smoothness are specified. Their high complexity indicates that, in general, the problem of extending the method to surfaces of higher regularity is extremely intricate. <p> + c v 2k+2 + h:o:t: (4.7) and consequently, since H = a + c 6= 0, the bi-degree of z j (u; v) is at least 2k + 2. fl 13 D 1 -patches are characterized in [Rei93], [Rei94], and conditions for D 2 -patches can be found in <ref> [Boh95] </ref>. While tangent plane continuity can be guaranteed essentially by a simple coplanarity constraint, already curvature continuity leads to extremely complicated nonlinear necessary conditions. Characterizations for D k -patches for general k seem to be too intricate to be useful, or even to be determinable with reasonable effort. <p> Second, the idea of TURBS can be adapted to splines over domains formed by triangles. Some promising results have already been obtained for C 1 and C 2 -spline surfaces incorporating degenerate triangular Bezier patches, see [Rei93], [Str93], [NP94], <ref> [Boh95] </ref>. Third, the refinement property can be dropped in order to lower the polynomial degree of the regular segments. For instance, it is possible to construct essentially bicubic C 2 -spline surfaces, i.e. only the irregular segments and their neighbors have bi-degree six, all other segments are bicubic.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, at least two regular vertices must lie between any two extraordinary vertices. This is no essential limitation since any polyhedral mesh can be transformed into a structure of the desired type by at most a triple binary split of Catmull-Clark type, <ref> [CC78] </ref>. * TURBS are a natural extension of a certain class of standard NURBS. * The order of smoothness k 2 N can be chosen arbitrarily. * The polynomial bi-degree of the spline segments is d = 2k + 2.

Reference-contexts: A very general result on refineable non-regular spaces of piecewise polynomial spline surfaces states that non-trivial smoothness of order k is possible only if the bi-degree of the surface segments is at least 2k + 2, cf. <ref> [Rei] </ref>. Consequently, the chosen degree is optimal. An alternate verification of this is given in Theorem 4.1. The simplifying assumption on the equidistance of knots is not necessary, but can be justified by the following argument.
