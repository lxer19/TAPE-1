Title: Recognizing Activities  
Author: Ramprasad Polana and Randal Nelson 
Address: Rochester, New York 14627  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Rochester  
Abstract: The recognition of repetitive movements characteristic of walking people, galloping horses, or flying birds is a routine function of the human visual system. It has been demonstrated that humans can recognize such activity solely on the basis of motion information. We demonstrate a general computational method for recognizing such movements in real image sequences using what is essentially template matching in a motion feature space coupled with a technique for detecting and normalizing periodic activities. This contrasts with earlier model-based approaches for recognizing such activities.

Reference-contexts: Ander son et al. [ Anderson et al., 1985 ] describe a method of change detection for surveillance applications based on the spectral energy in a temporal difference image. Finally, there is a body of work based on the analysis of trajectories [ Gould and Shah, 1989 ] , <ref> [ Allmen and Dyer, 1990 ] </ref> and [ Tsai et al., 1993 ] . All these require robust computation of the trajectories or spatiotem-poral curves from image sequences before attempting recognition.

Reference-contexts: The classic demonstration of pure motion recognition by humans is provided by Moving Light Display exper iments <ref> [ Johansson, 1973 ] </ref> , where human subjects were able to distinguish activities such as walking, running or stair climbing, from lights attached to the joints of an actor.

Reference-contexts: All these require robust computation of the trajectories or spatiotem-poral curves from image sequences before attempting recognition. We define activities to be the motion patterns which are temporally periodic and possess compact spatial structure as opposed to temporal textures <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1992 ] </ref> which exhibit statistical regularity but have indeterminate spatial and temporal extent. In this paper, we describe a robust method for recognizing activities, including ones, such as walking, that involve simultaneous translation of the actor.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe a robust method for recognizing activities, including ones, such as walking, that involve simultaneous translation of the actor. An earlier paper <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1994 ] </ref> , described an algorithm to detect periodic activities in an image sequence. Motion recognition algorithms, both for temporal texture and activity, have potential applications in several areas. One area is automated surveillance. <p> In an earlier paper we have described a technique for accomplishing this <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1994 ] </ref> . The present work will utilize the information computed in the detection stage for recognition and classification of specific activities. Activities involve a regularly repeating sequence of motion events.
