Title: Grasp Analysis as Linear Matrix Inequality Problems  
Author: Li Han Jeffrey C. Trinkle Zexiang Li 
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Eng. Texas A M Univ. Hong Kong Univ. of Science and Technology  
Abstract: Three important problems in the study of grasping and manipulation by multifingered robotic hands are: (a) Given a grasp characterized by a set of contact points and the associated contact models, determine if the grasp has force closure; (b) If the grasp does not have force closure, determine if the fingers are able to apply a specified resultant wrench on the object; and (c) Compute "optimal" contact forces if the answer to problem (b) is affirmative. In this paper, based on an early result by Buss, Hashimoto and Moore, which transforms the nonlinear friction cone constraints into positive definiteness of certain symmetric matrices, we further cast the friction cone constraints into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and formulate all three of the problems stated above as a set of convex optimization problems involving LMIs. The latter problems have been extensively studied in optimization and control community and highly efficient algorithms with polynomial time complexity are now available for their solutions. We perform simulation studies to show the simplicity and efficiency of the LMI formulation to the three problems.

Reference-contexts: the BHM observation and a detailed analysis of the structure of the symmetric positive definite matrices arising from the friction cone constraints, we further cast the friction cone constraints into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and formulate the basic grasp analysis problems as a set of convex optimization problems involving LMIs <ref> [1] </ref>.

We perform simulation studies to show the simplicity and efficiency of the LMI formulation to the three problems. 2 Problem Review Consider an object grasped by a k-fingered robotic hand. <p> Replacing in equation (15) by &gt; defines the constraint of the interior of the friction cone, int (F ). An inequality of the form (15) is a special case, with S 0 being zero, of what is called a nonstrict linear matrix inequality (LMI) <ref> [1] </ref> Q (x) = S 0 + l=1 where x 2 R m is the variable and the constant matrices S 0 l s are symmetric. <p> The interior friction cone constraint corresponds to a strict linear matrix inequality whose general form is Q (x) = S 0 + l=1 Recall that a set A ae R m is convex if 8a 1 ; a 2 2 A; 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, a 1 + (1 )a 2 is also in A. One key property of LMIs is that both nonstrict LMIs (16) and strict LMIs (17) are convex constraints on x, i.e., their feasible sets are convex, as shown in the following proposition [7]. <p> In general, LMIs can be viewed as an extension of linear inequality constraints where the componentwise inequalities between vectors are replaced by matrix inequalities. It is shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that the LMIs (16) (17) can represent a wide class of convex constrains on x such as linear inequalities, (convex) quadratic inequalities and matrix norm inequalities. Here we will only take a linear inequality constraint as an example. <p> In this section, we will analyze these problems and transform them into standard convex optimization problems involving LMIs. The resulting problems can be efficiently solved in polynomial time using recently developed interior-point methods <ref> [16, 1] </ref>. 4.1 Force Closure Problem It is shown that a grasp has force closure if and only if the grasp map G has full row rank and there exists a strictly internal grasping force [14]. <p> The latter problem is a standard LMI fea sibility problem <ref> [1] </ref> and efficient algorithms exist for its solution. 4.2 Grasping Force Existence Problem The grasping force existence problem is very simi lar to the internal force existence problem and can be solved using a similar approach: First, determine if there exists a solution x 0 2 R m for the linear <p> In order to apply the convex optimization algorithms in <ref> [16, 1] </ref> to the above problems we need to show that the objective function and the domain of the function are both convex [7]. Proposition 3 The constraint domains A x in (28) and A z in (29) are convex.

Reference-contexts: Nonlinear programming approaches [15] have also been proposed for the grasping force optimization problem. However, current computing resources can only allow off-line analysis. One major progress in the study of grasping force optimization was made by Buss, Hashimoto and Moore (BHM) <ref> [3] </ref>. They made the important observation that the nonlinear friction cone constraints are equivalent to positive definiteness of certain symmetric matrices. <p> Consequently, the grasping force optimization problem was formulated as an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of linearly constrained symmetric positive definite matrices and solved by projected gradient flow methods <ref> [3, 2] </ref>.

Figure (2) shows the optimization of the normal forces for different weights. As observed by Buss, Hashimoto and Moore <ref> [3] </ref>, a smaller weight resulted in larger normal wrenches and therefore a tighter grasp on the object. Similar trends were observed for soft finger contacts with elliptic approximations [7]. 5.3 Three-Fingered Grasps Consider two three-fingered grasps of a unit sphere on its equator. <p> The major stumbling block has been the nonlinear friction cone constraints imposed by the contact models. In this paper, based on the important observation by Buss, Hashimoto and Moore <ref> [3] </ref>, that the nonlinear friction cone constraints are equivalent to the constraint that certain symmetric matrices be positive definite, we further cast the friction cone constraints into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and formulate the basic grasp analysis problems as a set of convex optimization problems involving LMIs.

Reference-contexts: These three problems will collectively be referred to as grasp analysis problems. One may note that these problems also arise in the study of foot-step planning and force distribution by multilegged robots <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One key property of LMIs is that both nonstrict LMIs (16) and strict LMIs (17) are convex constraints on x, i.e., their feasible sets are convex, as shown in the following proposition <ref> [7] </ref>. Proposition 1 Given Q (x) = S 0 + P m l=1 x l S l , where S l = S T l ; l = 0; ; m. <p> the null space and the friction cone constraints for strictly internal forces: ~ P (z) := P (V z) = l=1 z l ~ S l &gt; 0 (23) ~ P (z) is indeed a LMI since LMI structure is preserved under affine transformations as shown in the following proposition <ref> [7] </ref>. Proposition 2 Given Q (x) = S 0 + P m l=1 x l S l , where S l = S T l ; l = 0; ; m. <p> In order to apply the convex optimization algorithms in [16, 1] to the above problems we need to show that the objective function and the domain of the function are both convex <ref> [7] </ref>. Proposition 3 The constraint domains A x in (28) and A z in (29) are convex. Proposition 4 The functions (x) and ~ (z) are strictly convex functions on the sets A x and A z , respectively. <p> All simulations presented here used -10 and 10 as lower and upper bounds for all contact wrenches. Other simulation parameters can be found in our technical report <ref> [7] </ref>. All our simulations were done within matlab5 on a Sun SPARCstation 4. <p> All simulations observed monotone decreasing objective values during the optimization procedure and we will only show the trend of the objective function for one example. More simulation results can be found in our technical report <ref> [7] </ref>. 5.1 A Four-Fingered Grasp Here we considered the same numerical example as given in paper [2]. It has four hard fingers grasping a rectangular prism with PCWF contacts. <p> Figure (2) shows the optimization of the normal forces for different weights. As observed by Buss, Hashimoto and Moore [3], a smaller weight resulted in larger normal wrenches and therefore a tighter grasp on the object. Similar trends were observed for soft finger contacts with elliptic approximations <ref> [7] </ref>. 5.3 Three-Fingered Grasps Consider two three-fingered grasps of a unit sphere on its equator. The first scenario is that two fingers, say, finger 2 and 3, are close to each other and are both close to the antipodal point of finger 1. <p> In this section, these two grasps will be referred to as the antipodal grasp and the equilateral grasp. It is easy to prove that both grasps have force closure under our simulation parameters <ref> [7] </ref>, no matter what contact models are used. However, because of the constraints on the contact wrenches, they cannot generate arbitrary object wrenches. Figure (3) shows the simulation results for generating object wrench (17.000,- 0.5472,0,0,0,0) by the three-fingered PCWF antipodal grasp. <p> The feasibility, optimization and computation times were 0.32sec, 0.21sec and 0.82 sec, respectively. It took maxdet 0.31sec to determine the infeasibility of the given object wrench for the PCWF equilat eral grasp. This conclusion can be easily verified by straightforward computation <ref> [7] </ref>. Remark 2. The simulation in this subsection (in fact, all simulations we performed) required more time to determine feasibility than to optimize the wrenches. This implies that feasibility is a harder problem than optimization.

As for frictional grasps, the force closure theorems <ref> [17, 20] </ref> have been expressed in geometric terms such as antipodal positions and specialized for the grasps characterized by the number of contact points and the associated contact models.

Reference-contexts: Then the whole friction cone P (x) 0 will be used in the optimization. Such a linear objective function will lead the grasping force optimization problem to a standard semi-definite programming problem <ref> [22] </ref> or a standard second order cone programming problem [11], depending on the friction cone constraints being cast into LMIs (7, 8, 9) or the conventional cone constraints (2,3, 4).

Reference-contexts: Problems (31) and (32) are thus shown to be convex optimization problems involving LMIs. Problem (32) is also in the standard form of determinant maximization problem with LMI constraints <ref> [23] </ref> and can be efficiently solved using existing software package. Remark 1. The barrier term ln detP 1 (x) in the objective function (30), in fact, requires P (x) &gt; 0. Another way to define a convex objective function is to only include the linear term w T x. <p> We downloaded the source code of maxdet (written in ANSI C) from http://www.stanford.edu/boyd/MAXDET.html and extended it to record the contact forces and objective values during the optimization procedure. Please refer to paper <ref> [23] </ref> and manual [24] for the information of the algorithm and the software package. To simplify the presentation, we assumed lower and upper bounds for the contact force components as a simplified way to incorporate joint effort constraints.
