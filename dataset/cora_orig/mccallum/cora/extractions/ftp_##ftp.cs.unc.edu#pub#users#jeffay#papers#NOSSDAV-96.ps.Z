Abstract: Many distributed multimedia applications require real-time network communication services to be effective. Although architectural models for real-time communication on the Internet are evolving (e.g., [2]), none appear to consider the problem of realizing real-time performance on existing local-area networks. This is important as the first and last mile of a network connection the portion from a sending workstation to an Internet-bound router on the originating campus, and the portion from an inbound router to a receiving workstation on the destination campus are likely to employ conventional LAN technologies that cannot reliably provide real-time service. We are investigating the problem of congestion control in a campus-area network. We advocate the placement of a set of simple, generic media adaptations into campus routers for the purpose of ameliorating the effects of congestion along the first/last mile of a connection. The adaptations and their implementation are designed to complement proposed schemes such as RSVP for real-time communication through the wide-area network. We demonstrate empirically that our router-based congestion control scheme is capable of supporting an effective, best-effort, real-time transmission service across congested campus networks. To be effective, distributed applications that manipulate real-time continuous media require continuous, low-latency delivery of media units from sender to receiver(s). One of the major obstacles to realizing these requirements on local-area networks (LANs) is the fact that the vast majority of todays LANs (e.g., ethernet, token ring, and FDDI networks) provide little support for real-time communication. Without such support, competition for network resources can lead to network congestion that adversely affects the playout of media streams and, in the case of highly interactive applications such as desktop videoconferencing, can render an application useless. Packet delays and losses have a severe impact on the playout of continuous media such as audio and video. For example, in a desktop videoconferencing system, packet delays increase end-to-end latency and can seriously impair and impede interaction. Similarly, packet loss, and variable packet delays, can lead to gaps in the playout of media streams intervals in which no audio/video data is played that disrupt communication between conference participants. Thus, a fundamental problem in the transmission and management of real-time continuous media data on current LANs is ameliorating the effects of congestion to provide adequate throughput and latency.
