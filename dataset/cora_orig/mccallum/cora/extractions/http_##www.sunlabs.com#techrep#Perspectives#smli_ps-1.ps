Reference-contexts: If the technology you do isn't fun for you, you may wish to seek other employment. Without the fun, none of us would go on. I tried to capture the spirit of research as a game in my paper about our walking robot <ref> [2] </ref>. Unfortunately, the editors removed from my paper all of the personal comments, the little poem about the robot by Claude Shannon, the pranks and jokes, and in short, the fun. The only fun they left was the title: Footprints in the Asphalt.
Reference: [3] <author> Sutherland, </author> <title> I.E., Sproull, R.F., and Schumacker, R.A. "A Characterization of Ten HiddenSurface Algorithms." </title> <journal> Computing Surveys: Journal of the ACM. </journal> <month> March </month> <year> 1974. </year> <note> Summarized in Naval Research Reviews. </note> <month> June </month> <year> 1975, </year> <pages> pp. 21-23. </pages>
Reference-contexts: No wonder it was so hard to prove. 28 I stopped doing graphics research just after Bob Sproull, Bob Schumacker , and I wrote A Characterization of Ten Hidden Surface Algorithms <ref> [3] </ref>. We discovered that the task of computing which surfaces of a solid object are hidden and which are visible is a sorting problem.
Reference: [4] <author> Sutherland, I.E., and Oestreicher, D. </author> <title> "How Big Should a Printed Circuit Board Be?" IEEE Transactions of Computers. </title> <booktitle> Vol. </booktitle> <address> C22, </address> <month> May </month> <year> 1973, </year> <pages> pp. 537-542. </pages>
Reference-contexts: This simple observation led us to explore other wiring patterns, gather some data from real printed circuit boards, and eventually to publish a paper <ref> [4] </ref> called How Big Should a Printed Cir cuit Board Be? Follow your curiosity. Beauty provides another form of personal encouragement for me. Some of the products of research are just pretty, although mathematicians prefer to use the word elegant.
Reference: [5] <author> Sutherland, </author> <title> I.E. "A Method of Solving Arbitrary W all Mazes by Computers." </title> <journal> IEEE Transactions on Computers. </journal> <volume> Vol. C18, No. 12, </volume> <month> December </month> <year> 1969, </year> <pages> pp. 1092-1097. </pages>
Reference-contexts: Recall the maze solving work I did in 1960 as a warm-up project. I was so sure no one would care about it that I never bothered to publish it until 1969 <ref> [5] </ref>. It turned out that my 1960 work drew questions even many years after publication, so someone must have cared. 24 This very talk is another example for me. The chronology of this paper is shown in Table 1 on the next page.
Reference: [6] <author> Myer, T.H., and Sutherland, </author> <title> I.E. "On the Design of Display Processors." </title> <journal> Communications of the ACM. June 1968, </journal> <volume> Vol. 11, No. 6, </volume> <pages> pp. 410-414. </pages>
Reference-contexts: The incremental reward always seems to outweigh the incremental effort. 3.14 Overcoming Risks Ted Meyer and I once noticed that every architecture for a computer display system can be improved for just a little more money <ref> [6] </ref>. This kind of observation offers a reason to stop a research program because it has proven to be recursive. Another example of a good reason to stop is that you are proven wrong.
Reference: [7] <author> Sutherland, </author> <title> I.E. "SketchpadA ManMachine Graphical Communication System." </title> <booktitle> Proceedings of the Spring Joint Computer Confer ence, </booktitle> <address> Detroit, Michigan. </address> <month> May </month> <year> 1963, </year> <institution> and MIT Lincoln Laboratory Technical Report #296, </institution> <month> January </month> <year> 1963. </year>
Reference-contexts: I may have been more sensitive to this risk than some of you might be, because I achieved some fame from writing an early drawing program <ref> [7] </ref>. It would be especially embarrassing for me if I should ask dumb questions about a drawing program. My unwillingness to learn new things, risking frustration or failure, is related to another familiar phenomenon. <p> After finishing it, I knew that I could write a complex computer program and make it work. My warm-up project encouraged me to go on to the larger programming task involved in thesis work <ref> [7] </ref> and it encouraged my sponsors to support the more complex project. My point is that a warmup project not only teaches, but also encourages. Some universities, including MIT , even require a Master's thesis, a formal warmup project, before the student embarks on a Ph.D.

Reference-contexts: After each of two extended vacations in Australia, I returned with patentable ideas <ref> [8, 9] </ref>, and on a third such trip developed a new algorithm for building vector quantization code books [13]. I sometimes jokingly start out describing these ideas by saying, When I was lying on the beach...

Reference-contexts: Now every under graduate electrical engineer becomes familiar with the square root of minus one, although they spell it j, rather than i, as mathematicians do. Many of my young friends at Apple Computer know the Gouraud shading <ref> [10] </ref> and Phong shading [11] algorithms. When I asked them who Gouraud and Phong were, none knew that both were graduate students at the time of their discoveries, nor even thought of them as real people.

Some universities formalize such changes as sabbatical leave.

Reference-contexts: It's always much easier in hindsight. Indeed, I think of scientific progress as the reduction of subjects from complete mystery to teachable form. 2. 1995 update: Still no book, but we did publish a paper <ref> [14] </ref> on the subject. 30 The best personal sources of courage are self confidence and comfort with yourself and your peers. In some people, these develop early. In others, they never appear.
