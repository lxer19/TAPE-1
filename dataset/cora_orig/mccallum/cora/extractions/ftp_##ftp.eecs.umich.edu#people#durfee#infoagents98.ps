Abstract: One of our goals when building the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) has been to prototype an architecture that can continually reconfigure itself as users, contents, and services come and go. We have worked toward this goal by developing a multi-agent information economy, where agents buy and sell information goods and services from each other using our commerce and communication protocols. We refer to the services and protocols offered by this economic infrastructure as the Service Market Society (SMS). Within the SMS, agents are able to find, work with, and even try to outsmart each other, as each agent attempts to accomplish the tasks for which it was created. When we open the door to decentralized decision-making among self-interested agents, there is a risk that the system will degenerate into chaos. In this chapter, we describe the protocols, services, and agent abilities embedded in the SMS infrastructure that combat such chaos while permitting flexibility, extensibility, and scalability of the system.

Reference-contexts: We refer to the services/protocols offered by this infrastructure as the Service Market Society (SMS). The SMS requires the integration of numerous agent technologies for knowledge exchange, commerce, learning, and modeling. Some of our earlier publications <ref> [1] </ref> have already explained the general agent architecture of the UMDL, along with the agents' communication system. In this paper we concentrate on how agents reason about and interact with each other, and how this in turn can lead to structural adaptation on the part of the entire system. <p> Bootstrapping the process to the point where third-parties have sufficient incentive to join is, not surprisingly, hard! 5 Agent communications use KQML primitives implemented using CORBA objects, see <ref> [1] </ref> for details.

Reference-contexts: They have even implemented some commerce interfaces [4]. However, in contrast to the work in this paper, they do not address the higher-level problem of agents finding each other (i.e. finding the services they want) and effectively taking part in the economy. The Alexandria Project <ref> [2] </ref> also addresses the issue of communication between users, collections, and mediators, but it does not use an economic framework for making resource allocation decisions. 2 THE SERVICE MARKET SOCIETY The UMDL SMS implements a multi-agent information economy where agents buy and sell services from each other.

Reference-contexts: If the agents were to determine their bid prices based on a fixed utility function, we might expect to find periodic or chaotic behavior <ref> [3] </ref>, which we wish to avoid. 1-level Agents 1-level QPAs take advantage of price fluctuations by keeping models of the QPAs and UIAs and using these to make better predictions as to what they should bid.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4 illustrates these agents' interactions with the SCA. Agents are in ovals, ontologies in rectangles, and the arrows connecting agents represent messages, paraphrased in natural language. These messages are expressed in Loom, a description logic in the KL-ONE family <ref> [5] </ref>. To communicate with the SCA, agents use terminology from the nested ontologies. In the figure, the thin line around the SCA is jagged to show that the set of available terms is dynamic; both QPAs and the AMA add concepts to the agent services ontology.

However, when we take the log files collected over several weeks at the schools, and simulate having 40 classrooms with 15 workstations each using UMDL over a one-hour period, the load triggers the creation of two more QPAs via the mechanisms we have described. </title>
Reference-contexts: In the case of negotiation mechanisms, UMDL uses a generalized auction specification to allow goods and services to be offered under a wide variety of terms <ref> [6] </ref>. While generalized auctions are not the only possible kinds of negotiation mechanisms, they offer many advantages. They provide a structured, yet flexible market infrastructure promoting automated negotiation due to the following characteristics: 1. Mediated (vs.

Reference-contexts: A Strategy based on stochastic modeling (p-strategy) We have developed an agent's bidding strategy based on stochastic modeling (called p-strategy) for the UMDL SMS, the details of which are given in <ref> [7] </ref>. The main idea behind the p-strategy is to capture the factors which influence the expected utility for the agent, using Markov chains. For instance, a seller is likely to raise its offer price when there are many buyers or when it expects more buyers to come. <p> The number of buyers and sellers at the auction, the arrival rates of future buyers and sellers, and the distribution of buy and sell prices are among the identified factors. The p-strategy is able to take those factors into account in its stochastic model. In our previous research <ref> [7] </ref>, we have shown that an agent possessing the p-strategy has an advantage over agents that do not possess it when they compete in multi-agent auctions. Given that the p-strategy is effective in the UMDL auction, nothing prohibits any self-interested agent from adopting the p-strategy.

Reference-contexts: We expect many p-strategy agents to coexist in the UMDL, and thus are interested in the collective behavior of such agents. In what follows, we briefly summarize our observations which are more completely detailed elsewhere <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this scenario, users want to find sources of information for various topics (e.g. history, science or mathematics) and various audience levels (e.g. middle school, high school, or professional). Query Planning Agents (QPAs) <ref> [10] </ref>, act as middlemen, accepting queries from users and returning collections related to those queries. Initially, the user sends a query, via a web-based Java interface, to the UIA. The UIA must then find an agent that can service this query.

Reference-contexts: A QPA's only preference was to increase its immediate profit, i.e. place its bid in order to maximize its expected profit (remember that failing to get a sale means the QPA gets zero profit). We gave the agents different learning abilities (see <ref> [11] </ref>). 0-level agents used reinforcement learning on the prices/values received. 1-level agents actually tried to model the other agents as 0-level agents. <p> The 1-level models, while computationally expensive, allow QPAs to track the individual agents more closely, thereby identifying when a UIA is willing to pay more than the going rate. Previous research has shown that the advantages of 1-level models can be correlated to the price volatility (see <ref> [11] </ref>). However, this strategic thinking is only successful against 0-level UIAs. When we tested the 1-level QPAs against the 1-level UIAs, as seen in Figure 10, we found the QPA's performance on par with other similar 0-level QPAs.

Reference-contexts: Declarative formalisms with less expressiveness than ontologies, such as relational databases, force a commitment to particular levels of granularity and particular perspectives. Fig. 3. Multi-dimensional, multi-perspective complexity To promote reuse, the UMDL ontology is divided into nested modules (each of which is itself called an ontology) <ref> [12] </ref>. The most general includes library content and services that we consider to be part of a "generic" digital library. The second module adds concepts specific to the UMDL implementation, such as auctions. The third module describes agent services.
