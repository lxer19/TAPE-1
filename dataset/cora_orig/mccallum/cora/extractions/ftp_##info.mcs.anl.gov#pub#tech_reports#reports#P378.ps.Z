Abstract: At CADE-10 Ross Overbeek proposed a two-part contest to stimulate and reward work in automated theorem proving. The first part consists of seven theorems to be proved with resolution, and the second part of equational theorems. Our theorem provers Otter and its parallel child Roo proved all of the resolution theorems and half of the equational theorems. This paper represents a family of entries in the contest.

Reference-contexts: Equality is still required and is indeed quite useful for demodulation. Although not explicitly stated in the contest rules, we believe that demodulation is permitted, but that paramodulation is not. This has been the traditional approach when using the P-formulation <ref> [5, 4] </ref>, and we have followed it. Theorem 1. x 2 = e groups are commutative, stated in the P-formulation. Theorem 2. The commutator theorem: if a group has the property x 3 = e, then [[x; y]; y] = e, where [x; y] = xyx 1 y 1 .

This option causes Otter and Roo to automatically set a collec-tion of options that approximate a Knuth-Bendix completion procedure.
