Abstract: At the Institute of Control and Automation Engineering Design/CPN has been used to model the European Control System (ETCS) within a project for the Deutsche Bahn AG (German railways). This paper reports of experiences in modelling this complex, distributed automation system using Coloured Petri Nets and the Design/CPN tools. We will concentrate on some technical issues. However, for motivation we will give a brief overview of the application and will describe the modelling paradigms that we applied.

Reference-contexts: The second one is a time consuming solution, which leads to increased operational costs. Thus, it is important to define a train control system which is standard for all countries and provides a uniform and language-independent signalling information for the man-machine-interface (MMI). <ref> [Frosig95] </ref> Moreover, the increase of new developed trains' maximum speed demands a communication-based train control system, because at a travelling speed of more than 160 km/h the trackside signals aren't surely recognisable any more. So for high-speed railway service the application of a communication-based train control system is necessary.

Reference-contexts: For an overview of the overall architecture of ETCS and the main components see figure 1. Further information on the topic can be found in <ref> [JaLeMeSc97] </ref>. For simulation purposes, we substitute the missing components by dummy solutions or by manually providing the missing stimuli directly to the interfaces of the receiving component nets. ETCS is a modular and communication based approach to train control systems.

Reference-contexts: A specific model for system functionality will be quite different from a model used for availability considerations. In modelling the European Train Control System, different modelling aspects have been integrated <ref> [JaLePtSc97] </ref>: * components * scenarios * functions, are shown on different model levels. When modelling the component view, the focus is on communication and interaction of different subsystems. A general representation of these nets shows the subsystems and their interfaces, every subsystem being detailed on additional levels.

When modelling the component view, the focus is on communication and interaction of different subsystems. A general representation of these nets shows the subsystems and their interfaces, every subsystem being detailed on additional levels. In [JaLePtSc97] this was called the process aspect. The scenario-based view is the modelling of operational procedures. Its main elements are the interaction between on-board and trackside equipment and the sequence of events required to maintain operation. <p> For structuring the main component models of the onboard system and the radio block centre, we adopted a layered approach, proposed by <ref> [JaLePtSc97] </ref>. Dynamics and functionality are described while distinguishing between scenarios and functions. Scenarios show the behaviour of a system in it's environmental context, especially regarding the technical process and railway operations. Functions are used to process input data that has been received from external components or internal sources.

Reference-contexts: For further details concerning the concept of hierarchy in Design/CPN see <ref> [Jensen92] </ref>. At a first quick glance, we identified the problem as a need of sharing a local process by a number of other processes, sometimes even at the same time.

Reference-contexts: for completeness but was not yet studied in our project and therefore will not be considered in this paper. 3.5 Synchronization Mechanism for Discrete Time For the distributed model execution we developed a preliminary version of a synchronization mechanism for discrete time simulation, adopting the method of barrier sychronization (see <ref> [Lange97] </ref>) for CP-nets and Design/CPN. The mechanism is based on a central process serving the global time to the local Design/CPN clocks. These clocks are maintained by the distributed Design/CPN simulation tasks. The synchronization of a Design/CPN simulation is realized by adding a special net page to each component net.
