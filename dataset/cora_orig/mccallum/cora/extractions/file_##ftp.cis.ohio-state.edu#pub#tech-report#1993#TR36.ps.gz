Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for implementing broadcast on k-ary n-cube wormhole-routed systems. Instead of using the traditional Hamiltonian-path-based or the unicast-based solution, this scheme uses multidestination worms on a set of dimension-disjoint paths. These worms are capable of delivering a message to a set of destination nodes from a single source node on a given path. Using a phase-disjoint scheduling of these worms on the dimension-disjoint paths, we show that one-to-all and all-to-all broadcasting can be implemented on k-ary n-cube systems in maximum n phases, incurring maximum n communication start-ups. The number of startups can be reduced further by using multidimensional paths. Though better broadcasting solutions exist for hypercubes (k=2), our solution is the best for systems with larger k. As low-dimensional systems (2D/3D meshes with larger k) are becoming popular, the proposed solution demonstrates significance in implementing collective communication on these systems efficiently.

Reference-contexts: For all-to-all broadcasting, this scheme also incurs significant blocking. Their enhanced scheme [16] allows multicasting/broadcasting using unicast messages. However, such schemes need O (log d) startups for a destination set of size (d). The scheme proposed by Van de Geijn <ref> [2] </ref> uses n (log k) communication startups to implement one-to-all broadcasting on a k-ary n-cube. However, no scheme has been proposed to reduce the number of startups any further. <p> Thus, n startups are required, one per phase. Also, since all the paths cover only a single dimension, a message never makes a turn from one dimension to another. Thus, the possibility of blocking or deadlock doesn't arise. The Unicast based scheme in <ref> [2] </ref> uses log k startups to broadcast in a single dimension as compared to just a single startup using the new scheme. Hence , the new scheme is seen 5 scheme. The broadcast consists of 3 phases. to be faster than the earlier one by a factor of log k.

Reference-contexts: This scheme requires n communication startups using single-dimensional paths. Based on this approach, we present algorithms for both one-to-all and all-to-all broadcasting under single-and multiple-port models.

Using multiple-dimensional paths, we show that the number of startups can be reduced further. The paper is organized as follows. We define single and multiple-dimensional paths in Section 2 and show their differences with Hamiltonian path. Section 3 presents algorithms for one-to-all broadcasting.

Reference-contexts: For 2 a 3D system, this grouping can be identified as ((1; 2); 3). Similarly, other groupings like ((2; 3); 1) and ((3; 1); 2) are also possible. In general, for higher dimensional meshes, the number of possibilities increases. As discussed in <ref> [18] </ref>, the n dimensions can be divided into l groups and this division can be represented as a l-component tuple (n 1 ; n 2 ; : : : ; n l ), where n = n 1 + n 2 + : : : + n l . <p> Depending on the values of t s ; t p and k, a particular combination of multidimensional paths might give the optimal (in terms of time taken for broadcast) solution to the broadcast problem. A decision-tree approach similar to optimized synchronization cost in <ref> [18] </ref> can be used to decide on the combination of multidimension paths to be used, given the values of t s ; t p and k.
