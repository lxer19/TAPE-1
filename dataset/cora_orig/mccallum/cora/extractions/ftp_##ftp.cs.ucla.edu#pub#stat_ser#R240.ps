Title: Axioms of Causal Relevance  
Author: David Galles and Judea Pearl 
Address: Los Angeles, CA 90024  
Affiliation: Cognitive Systems Laboratory Computer Science Department University of California,  
Abstract: This paper develops axioms and formal semantics for statements of the form "X is causally irrelevant to Y in context Z," which we interpret to mean "Changing X will not affect Y if we hold Z constant." The axiomization of causal irrelevance is contrasted with the axiomization of informational irrelevance, as in "Learning X will not alter our belief in Y , once we know Z." Two versions of causal irrelevance are analyzed, probabilistic and deterministic. We show that, unless stability is assumed, the probabilistic definition yields a very loose structure, that is governed by just two trivial axioms. Under the stability assumption, probabilistic causal irrelevance is isomorphic to path interception in cyclic graphs. Under the deterministic definition, causal irrelevance complies with all of the axioms of path interception in cyclic graphs, with the exception of transitivity. We compare our formalism to that of [Lewis, 1973], and offer a graphical method of proving theorems about causal relevance.

Reference-contexts: Axiomatic characterization of causal relevance may serve as a normative standard for theories of action as well as a guide for developing representation schemes (e.g., graphical models) for planning and decision-making applications. For example, instead of explicitly storing all possible effects of an action, as in STRIPS <ref> [Fikes and Nilsson, 1972] </ref>, such representation schemes should enable an agent to examine only direct effects of actions, and infer which actions are relevant for a given goal, and which actions cease to be relevant once others are implemented.

The unique feature of our formulation of actions, which sets it apart from the formulations in control theory or decision analysis <ref> [Savage, 1954, Heckerman and Shachter, 1995] </ref>, is that an action is treated as a modality, namely, it is not given an explicit name but acquires the names of the propositions that it enforces as true. <p> This definition of irrelevance bears some similarity to the idea of limited unresponsiveness presented in <ref> [Heckerman and Shachter, 1995] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the graphoid axioms cap ture the most important features of informational relevance, "Learning irrelevant information 7 should not alter the relevance status of other propositions in the system; what was relevant remains relevant, and what was irrelevant remains irrelevant." <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref> One of the most salient difference between informational and causal relevance is the property of symmetry, axiom 1.1. Informational relevance is symmetric, stating that if X is relevant to Y , then Y is relevant to X as well. <p> Conversely, wetting the grass has no physical effect on the state of the sprinkler, and gives us no information about whether the sprinkler was on or off. Another basic difference between informational and causal relevance is that in the former the rule of hypothetical middle <ref> [Pearl, 1988, p. 17] </ref> always holds: MIN x P (yjx) P (y) MAX x P (yjx) (7) In causal relevance, P (y) might greater than MAX x P (yj^x), or less than MIN x P (yj^x).

Reference-contexts: Following <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref> we will adopt here a definition that generalizes most causal models used in engineering and economics. <p> There is a strong connection between the the sentence above and our interpretation of Y x (u) <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref>. Definition 2 interprets the abstract, counterfactual sentence above in terms of the processes responsible for Y taking on the value Y x (u) as X changes to x. <p> "Z can be selected if, for every x, the value that Y would obtain had X been x is conditionally independent of X, given Z." A criterion for selecting Z can be obtained from the graph G (T ) underlying a causal theory, as given by the "back-door criterion" in <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref>. The question we attempt to answer in this section is whether the relation of causal irrelevance, CI P (), is governed by a set of axioms similar to those governing informational irrelevance I (). <p> This affinity leads to graphical methods of proving theorems about causal relevance and explains, in part, why graphs are so prevalent in causal talk and causal modeling. 7 Philosophers, statisticians, and economists have been notoriously sloppy about confusing "holding Z constant" with "conditioning on a given Z" <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref>. 23 Acknowledgments This research was partially supported by Air Force grant #AFOSR/F496209410173, NSF grant #IRI-9420306, and Rockwell/Northrop Micro grant #94-100.

Reference-contexts: In fact, Definition 3 is stronger than Eq.

The two concepts are however different. Ignorability allows us to ignore HOW X obtained its value x, while irrelevance allows us to ignore which value X actually obtained.

Reference-contexts: Graphical ramifications were explicated in [Spirtes et al., 1993] and [Pearl, 1993]. Interpretations of causal and counterfactual utterances in terms of Y x (u) are given in [Pearl, 1996a].Other formulations of causality, in terms of event trees are given in [Robins, 1987] and <ref> [Shafer, 1996] </ref>. Note that Y x (u) is well defined even when U = u and X = x are incompatible in T , thus allowing for actions to enforce propositions that are not realized under normal conditions.

Reference-contexts: irrelevance is concerned with statements of the form "X is causally irrelevant to Y given Z," which we take to mean "Changing X will not alter the value of Y , if Z is fixed." The notion of causal relevance has its roots in the philosophical works of [Good, 1961], <ref> [Suppes, 1970] </ref> and [Salmon, 1984], who attempted to give probabilistic interpretations to 1 The term "relevance" will be used primarily as a generic name for the relationship of being relevant or irrelevant.
