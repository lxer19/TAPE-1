Title: Configurable Adaptors for Multimedia Delivery an End System Middleware Solution  
Author: Baochun Li, Klara Nahrstedt 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Abstract: Current distributed multimedia applications demand Quality of Service (QoS) from the supporting system to facilitate effective services to the end users. However, within the range of QoS demands specified by the application, lower level transport facilities may not be able to constantly provide guaranteed QoS without perturbations, especially in the case of wireless communication. In this scenario, we introduce facilities in the middleware level of the end systems to perform QoS adaptations on a specific QoS metric that is measured from the raw QoS provided by the underlying layers. We refer to the facility performing this task as adaptors. We are able to analyze the behavior of QoS adaptations using developed theories from digital control systems, based on a simplified model for QoS metrics. In particular, we are able to configure these adaptors according to the desired adaptation agility of their adaptation behavior, while still preserving their stability. We show the viability of the approach by some preliminary experiments in the context of Video-On-Demand applications.

Reference-contexts: Recent research interests in mobile computing are addressing the issues in QoS adaptations for mobile transmissions over heterogeneous wireless networks <ref> [1] </ref> [17]. These research efforts focus on graceful adaptations to dynamic QoS variations in a mobile environment. Current state-of-the-art mobile environments must deal with scarce and dynamically varying resources in the end systems or delivery paths. <p> If we have a function H () whose magnitude at some frequency is G, then the equivalent value in decibels (dB) is 20log 10 G. Furthermore, it is often convenient to normalize the frequency response function to unity, namely in the range of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, giving a logarithmic plot with a maximum of 0 dB in the passband. We illustrate the frequency response plotted to the logarithmic scale in figure 10 (b). We now apply this adaptor to actual QoS metrics generated by the network QoS simulator illustrated in figure 9.

Reference-contexts: In more practical aspects, previous research efforts also focus on the preservation of Quality of Service, particularly in the case of audio and video transmissions, over best effort environments such as the Internet. Outstanding examples include the work at University of Illinois <ref> [2] </ref>, in which a real time protocol referred to as the Video Datagram Protocol (VDP) for transmitting video and audio data over best effort environments was developed. VDP reduces inter-frame jitter and dynamically adapted to the client CPU load and network congestion.

Reference-contexts: A more detailed design of the system is illustrated in Figure 9. For the purpose of fast prototyping and achieving capabilities to execute on heterogeneous environments, we used the Java language <ref> [5] </ref> for the implementation of the prototype adaptor. The Video-On-Demand application testbed, though, was implemented in a combination of C and Java languages, in which the MPEG-2 decompression engine was implemented in ANSI C due to the nature of MPEG-2 decompression complexity, and the display controls were implemented in Java.

Reference-contexts: Like other digital systems, adaptors can be classified with respect to time-invariance, causality, linearity and recursiveness [19]. In this paper, we only address the analysis and configuration of a subset of adaptors that are time-invariant, causal, and linear. We characterize this subset of adaptors in terms of difference equations <ref> [6] </ref>. Furthermore, we only discuss non-recursive adaptors in this paper, issues with recursive adaptors are discussed in [9]. <p> Similar to the theories of digital control systems, we propose to study the adaptation process in the frequency domain instead of the time domain. According to developed theories in digital control systems and digital signal processing <ref> [6] </ref> [19], it is possible to quantitatively express the frequency spectrum of the excitation signal and the frequency response of the transformation. By analyzing the adaptation process in the frequency domain instead of in the time domain, we could propose transformations that have the abilities to eliminate unwanted short-term perturbations. <p> In order to analyze an excitation signal or a transformation in its frequency domain, the common practice is to apply the Discrete Fourier Transform <ref> [6] </ref> on the signal. As known to the digital control theory, the transform preserves all the energy carried in the signal without any loss. By applying the Discrete Fourier Transform on an excitation signal,we are able to fully generate and analyze the frequency spectrum of an excitation signal. <p> By applying the Discrete Fourier Transform on an excitation signal,we are able to fully generate and analyze the frequency spectrum of an excitation signal. We could also apply Fourier Transform to analyze the frequency domain performance of the transformations performed by the adaptor. As noted in <ref> [6] </ref>, the frequency response H () of a transformation can be obtained by applying the Fourier Transform on the output response signal y (n) after applying the transformation on an unit impulse excitation signal. We illustrate a comparison between time and frequency domain analysis on a signal in Figure 5. <p> to be stable if and only if any bounded excitation results in a bounded response, i.e., if implies that jy (n)j &lt; 1 for all n (16) If we model the adaptation behavior as a transformation process expressed in difference equations as discussed previously, we could utilize the z Transform <ref> [6] </ref> to analyze the stability of such transformation. through the use of the z transform, the transformation of an adaptor can be characterized by a discrete-time transfer function, which profoundly facilitates time domain and frequency domain analysis on the transformation behavior. According to [6], the transfer function of an adaptor is <p> previously, we could utilize the z Transform <ref> [6] </ref> to analyze the stability of such transformation. through the use of the z transform, the transformation of an adaptor can be characterized by a discrete-time transfer function, which profoundly facilitates time domain and frequency domain analysis on the transformation behavior. According to [6], the transfer function of an adaptor is the z transform of the impulse response H (z). <p> If we plot the poles and zeros in the complex plane referred to as the z-plane <ref> [6] </ref>, the condition in equation (19) satisfies if and only if all poles p i are located inside the unit circle jzj = 1. 3.2.4 Configuring Adaptation Agility: the Fourier Transform Approach As noted previously, Discrete Fourier Transform could be used to analyze the frequency spectrum of a series of excitation <p> Starting with the ideal low pass characteristics of Figure 6, we can assume a zero-phase system for which H () is real, and assume unity gain between frequencies off . We could thus solve the integral in the inverse Discrete Fourier Transform <ref> [6] </ref> over the range of = to : Thus: h (n) = 2 = 2 off 1 " jn off 1 fe j off n e j off n g 1 sin (n off ) (20) For example, if we specify off to be 5 , using equation (20) we have <p> However, in order to improve the quality of the generated result after Inverse Fourier Transform, we may need to use more complex windowing functions such as the well known von Hann window or the Hamming window <ref> [6] </ref> [9]. 14 4 A Middleware Design of QoS Adaptors 4.1 General Infrastructure In order to verify the validity and performance issues of the proposed approach given by the previous sections, we developed prototype adaptors based on the proposed methods, and analyzed the performance and adaptation behavior of these prototype adaptors

Because of the limitations in measurements, the original values rate fl s [i] are a series of discrete-time values, or signals, rather than continuous-time signals. <p> It can be proved <ref> [7] </ref> that, if we express all the poles of H (z) defined in equation (17) in polar forms: p i = r i e j i ; f or i = 1; 2; : : : ; N (18) where r i is the radius and i is the angle. then: <p> The general form of difference equation for a non-recursive adaptor was introduced in Equation (14).

Reference-contexts: The goal of this work is also similar with the work presented in this paper, though the former only focuses on delay jitter adaptations during audio transmissions, and our work proposes a generic approach for modeling adaptation behavior. Similar research work is presented in <ref> [8] </ref>, which also focuses on jitter control of playing back continuous media streams.

Reference-contexts: We could therefore analyze and configure the adaptation subtask in the frequency domain, which proves to be more expressive of properties such as adaptation agility and stability <ref> [9] </ref>. Once these adaptors are configured, they are applied to the input quality of the subtask to generate the desired adapted quality, which is fed into the main task illustrated in Figure 1. Work for active adaptation is planned in the future. This paper is structured as follows. <p> Given above, we are able to define the common Quality of Service metrics such as system rate, generating rate, delay, loss and jitter <ref> [9] </ref>. As an example, we give a definition for the QoS metric System Rate, which will be used in our prototype QoS adaptors discussed in Section 5. System rate is generally referred to as transfer rate, bandwidth or throughput in a network transmission context. <p> In this paper, we only address the analysis and configuration of a subset of adaptors that are time-invariant, causal, and linear. We characterize this subset of adaptors in terms of difference equations [6]. Furthermore, we only discuss non-recursive adaptors in this paper, issues with recursive adaptors are discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> As the focus of this section, we will present the Fourier Transform approach to configure non-recursive adaptors, the Chebyshev approach was discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. One of the common characteristics of these approaches is that they both operate in the frequency domain, thus requiring the result of the configuration be converted back to the time domain in the form of difference equations. <p> However, in order to improve the quality of the generated result after Inverse Fourier Transform, we may need to use more complex windowing functions such as the well known von Hann window or the Hamming window [6] <ref> [9] </ref>. 14 4 A Middleware Design of QoS Adaptors 4.1 General Infrastructure In order to verify the validity and performance issues of the proposed approach given by the previous sections, we developed prototype adaptors based on the proposed methods, and analyzed the performance and adaptation behavior of these prototype adaptors in
