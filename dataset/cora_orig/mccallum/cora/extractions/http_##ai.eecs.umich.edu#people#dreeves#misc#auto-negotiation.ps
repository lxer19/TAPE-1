Abstract: We are examining ways to automate the negotiation of business contracts. We are developing a language for both fully-specified contracts that are to be executed and partially-specified contracts that are in the midst of being negotiated. This language begins with Courteous Logic Programs, a form of declarative logic-based knowledge representation. We are using this declarative language not only to express full or partial contracts, but also to express which aspects of a contract are negotiable. Specifying the negotiable aspects of a good or service includes specifying its attributes, their possible values, constraints, and dependencies. From the negotiable aspects, we are developing methods to structure negotiations, especially to select and configure auction mechanisms to carry out the negotiation. This work brings together two strands of our previous work on business process automation in electronic commerce: representing business rules shared between enterprises; and configurable auction mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: This is the current state of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). We are in the sparsely occupied middle ground, aiming for considerable expressive power but also considerable automatability. Our point of departure in developing the KR is pure logic programs (in the knowledge-representation-theory sense, not Prolog). (Baral and Gelfond <ref> [1] </ref> provide a helpful review.) Logic programs are not only declarative and relatively powerful expressively, but also practical, relatively computationally efficient, and widely deployed. We embody the representation concretely as XML messages. This choice enhances human readability and supports inclusion and generation of textual information.

Reference-contexts: Multiattribute auctions, typically 1 Looking at Yahoo alone yields 104 auction services listed, and 120,000 active auctions on their own service (http://auctions.yahoo.com/). 3 employed in procurement, allow specification of offers referring to multiple attributes of a single good <ref> [2] </ref>. Whether a multiattribute auction, a combinatorial auction, or an array of one- or zero-dimensional auctions is appropriate depends on several factors. Although a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper, we observe that these factors can bear on any of: * The legality of auction configurations. <p> Price and quantity parameters will remain distinguished by the mechanism since they are used in the scoring algorithm for multiattribute 6 auctions <ref> [2] </ref>. If there are multiple prices in the contract, they will need to be aggregated into a single payment. Prices for options, on the other hand, may be treated as any other attribute. Quantity is also distinguished since it is an additive attribute of a good.

Reference-contexts: We embody the representation concretely as XML messages. This choice enhances human readability and supports inclusion and generation of textual information. It will also facilitate parsing and integration with EDI components. 2 Our KR builds on our prior work representing business rules in "courteous logic programs" <ref> [3, 4] </ref> (see also Section 4.1). To express executable contracts, these rules must specify the goods and services to be provided, along with applicable terms and conditions. Such terms include customer service agreements, delivery schedules, conditions for returns, usage restrictions, and other issues relevant to the good or service provided. <p> We will thus later expressively generalize further to Situated Courteous LP's. Situated logic programs <ref> [3] </ref> hook beliefs to drive procedural API's. More precisely, situated LP's permit two semantically-clean kinds of procedural attachments for condition-testing ("sensing") and action-performing ("effecting"). Later we will also want to take a further step of expressive generalization to relax the cyclicity/recursion prohibition.

Reference-contexts: Auctions are rapidly proliferating on the Internet. 1 Although typical online auctions support simple negotiation services, researchers have begun to deploy mechanisms with advanced features. For example, our own Michigan Internet AuctionBot supports a high degree of configurability <ref> [8] </ref> (http://auction.eecs.umich.edu/), and IBM's auction system supports one-sided sales auctions integrated with other commerce facilities [6].
