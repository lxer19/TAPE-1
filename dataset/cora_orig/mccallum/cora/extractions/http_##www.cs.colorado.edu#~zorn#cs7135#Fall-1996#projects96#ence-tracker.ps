Reference-contexts: This tag uniquely identifies the user throughout the session and is kept in the URL. When a page is requested, the ManagIt CGI can strip the tag, make a session entry, and dynamically create the page. This is the same scheme as described in <ref> [1] </ref>. There are several drawbacks to systems that keep the identifier in the URL. Firstly, this method is not transparent to the user. Secondly, if the user does not identify himself at the beginning of each session, the same tag cannot be used for the same user.

Reference-contexts: There are several scheams that make session tracking possible, but they have some drawbacks. In the next section I present these scheams and their drawbacks. THE STATE OF THE ART Apart from writing a browser or HTTP server to provide session tracking data as described in <ref> [3] </ref>, there are a few commercial tools that do session tracking. One of these is ManageIt [8]. ManageIt is a pseudo object-based site building tool that allows one to specify classes of web pages and their attributes. The web pages are created dynamically when they are requested from the server. <p> Since I restarted the logs late in the project, I did not have enough data to generate meaningful probability matrices. Another issue th at needs to be addressed is the fact that someone can leave their browser unattended for hours. In <ref> [3] </ref> the authors use a time limit of 25.5 minutes to delineate new sessions. CONCLUSION The c urrent session tracking systems fall short in a number of ways. Some use methods that are not transparent to the user. Some require complicated software.

Reference-contexts: Within the Netscape distribution there is a package called netscape.javascript. This package defines a class (JSObject) that allows one to query and set the properties of JavaScript objects. The interface to the JSObject is very simple. Consult <ref> [5] </ref> for more information. Live Connect is very new. It has not become a standard and is subject to change. In some instances it is not very reliable. This aspect of Live Connect will be discussed later in this paper.

Reference: 9. <author> Netscape, </author> <title> Persistent Client State HTTP Cookies, </title> <note> Preliminary spec. http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html </note>
Reference-contexts: The state information is called a cookie. The cookie on the client side is set by a CGI by adding a string to the HTTP header. A possible (consult <ref> [9] </ref> for the full specification of HTTP cookies) form for the string is: Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; expires=DATE; path=PATH where: NAME specifies the name of the cookie. VALUE specifies the value to assign to the cookie of name NAME . DATE specifies the expiration date of the cookie.

Reference-contexts: The problem with this scheme is that if the client views the source, the client can see that cookies are being set. This is not as transparent as setting a cookie via CGI. Java Java is an objectoriented, platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. <ref> [10] </ref> Java allows a web page author to develop programs (called applets) that are downloaded from a web server to a client browser. These programs then run within the browsers to which they are downloaded.

Reference-contexts: The appended string after the ? is stripped from the URL by the server and is put into an environment variable called QUERY_STRING <ref> [12] </ref>. The program can extract the string from the environment and parse it. In this fashion arguments may be passed from the client to the program that runs on the server. The program does its computing on these arguments and produces output.
