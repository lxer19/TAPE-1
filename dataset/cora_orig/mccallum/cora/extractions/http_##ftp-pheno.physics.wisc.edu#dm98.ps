Abstract: With an effective telescope area of order 10 4 m 2 , a threshold of ~50 GeV and a pointing accuracy of 2.5 degrees, the AMANDA detector represents the first of a new generation of high energy neutrino telescopes, envisaged over 25 years ago. We describe its performance, focussing on the capability to detect halo dark matter particles via their annihilation into neutrinos.

Reference-contexts: 1 The Indirect Detection of Halo Dark Matter High energy neutrino telescopes are multi-purpose instruments; their science mission covers particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics, cosmology and cosmic ray physics. Their deployment creates new opportunities for glaciology and oceanography, possibly geology of the earth's core <ref> [1] </ref>. Astronomy with neutrinos does have definite advantages. They can reach us, essentially without attenuation in flux, from the largest red-shifts. The sky is, in contrast, partially opaque to high energy photons and protons because of energy-loss suffered in interactions with infrared light, CMBR photons and radio waves [2].

Reference-contexts: point back to their sources.) The drawback is that neutrinos are difficult to detect: the small interaction cross sections that enable them to travel without attenuation over a Hubble radius, are also the reason why kilometer-scale detectors are required in order to capture them in sufficient numbers to do astronomy <ref> [3] </ref>. Some opportunities may, however, be unique. If, for instance, the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays are beyond 10 2 Mpc, conventional astronomy is unlikely to discover them. Some science missions do not require a detector of kilometer size.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1 displays the neutrino flux from the center of the earth calculated in the context of su-persymmetric dark matter theories <ref> [4] </ref>. The direct capture rate of the WIMPs in germanium detectors is shown for comparison. Contours indicate the parameter space favored by grand unified theories. Most of this parameter space can be covered by improving the capabilities of existing detectors by 2 orders of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: Existing neutrino detectors have already excluded fluxes of neutrinos from the earth's center of order 1 event per 1000 m 2 per year. The best limits have been obtained by the Baksan experiment <ref> [5] </ref>. We will show that, with data already on tape, the AMANDA detector should have a discovery reach which is as good or larger for WIMP masses in excess of 100 GeV. The potential of neutrino telescopes as dark matter detectors has been documented in detail [6].

It consists of 300 optical modules deployed at a depth of 1500-2000 m; see Fig. 3. An optical module (OM) consists of an 8 inch photomultiplier tube and nothing else.

Reference-contexts: The optical properties of the ice are quantified by studying the propagation in the ice of pulses of laser light of nanosecond duration. The arrival times of the photons after 20 m and 40 m are shown in Fig. 5 for the shallow and deep ice <ref> [9] </ref>. The distributions have been normalized to equal areas; in reality, the probability that a photon travels 70 m in the deep ice is ~10 7 times larger. <p> We conclude from Fig. 6 that the agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulation is adequate. Less than one in 10 5 tracks is misreconstructed as originating below the detector <ref> [9] </ref>. Visual inspection reveals that the remaining misreconstructed tracks are mostly showers, radiated by muons or initiated by electron neutrinos, misreconstructed as up-going tracks of muon neutrino origin. At the 10 6 level of the background, candidate events can be identified; see Fig. 7.

Reference-contexts: Calibration of this detector is in progress, although data has been taken with 80 OM's which were deployed one year earlier in order to verify the optical properties of the ice (AMANDA-80). As anticipated from transparency measurements performed with the shallow strings <ref> [11] </ref> (see Fig. 3), we found that ice is bubble-free at 1400-1500 meters and below. The performance of the AMANDA detector is encapsulated in the event shown in Fig. 4. <p> The reality is that: * the absorption length is 100 m or more, depending on depth <ref> [11] </ref>; * the scattering length is 25~30 m (preliminary, this number represents an average value which may include the combined effects of deep ice and the refrozen ice disturbed by 6 to ice with some remnant bubbles above 1.4 km. the hot water drilling); * because of the large absorption length,

Reference-contexts: We reconstructed 6 months of filtered AMANDA-80 events subject to the conditions that 8 OMs report a signal in a time window of 2 microseconds.
