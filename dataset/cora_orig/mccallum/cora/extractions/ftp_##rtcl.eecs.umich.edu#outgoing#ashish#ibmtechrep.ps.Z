Details on different service classes can be found in [7, 9]. 2.1 RSVP: An End-to-End View D1,D2, and D3 are destinations of data.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, we have enhanced it from a NO QOS level to a STD QOS level by providing the traffic queueing and scheduling structure in Figure 6. These enhancements for reservation and scheduling functions are realized via extensions to the Network Services (NS) component of Common Data Link Interface (CDLI) <ref> [5] </ref> and the NDD (see Figure 3). We do not address the problem of resource reservation on a multi-access LANs. In that sense our solution is more appropriate for switched Token Ring or Ethernet.

Reference-contexts: Note that with this design, only the control path incurs the overhead of associating data sockets with reservations. Since the reservation handle is passed in the mbuf extension header, there is no additional packet classification <ref> [10, 8] </ref> overhead in the data path, thus keeping it efficient. 4.2 ATM Network Interface The Turboways adapter is an example of high-function network interface that supports shaping and scheduling of traffic in hardware. Consequently, no device driver extensions are required to support QoS connections on this interface.
