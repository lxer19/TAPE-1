Reference-contexts: The actual process of combination itself is straightforward. Since a group of refinements is generated to solve each incorrect behaviour, all possible combinations, where one refinement is chosen from each group, are generated. However, this is immediately followed by a repeat of KRUSTs usual refinement filtering <ref> (Craw & Sleeman, 1995) </ref>. This is necessary, for example, to remove duplicate refinements generated when a single fault leads to many incorrect behaviours. Conicting combinations of refinements are also removed.

Reference-contexts: This KB, given information about a particular student, determines whether or not they should be required to repay an educational loan. It should be noted that this example KB makes use of variables within the rules. The ability to refine KBs containing variables is a recent extension to KRUST <ref> (Palmer, 1995) </ref>. Since the supplied KB is correct, these examples were created by introducing faults artificially. Even in a small KB like the student loans example, it is not difficult to find combinations of corruptions that cause certain students to be classified correctly, but for the wrong reasons.
