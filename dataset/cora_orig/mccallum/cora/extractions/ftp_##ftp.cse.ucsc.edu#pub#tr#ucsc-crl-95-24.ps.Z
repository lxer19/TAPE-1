Reference-contexts: As the time-of-ight of the signal across the interconnect is greater than, or comparable to, the input signal rise-time (i.e. long interconnects), it is most difficult to capture the time-of-ight delay with a finite order of approximation [80, 83], whether a finite sum of exponentials <ref> [9, 54] </ref> or an exponentially decayed polynomial function [19, 49]. Hence, the time-of-ight , (more precisely the factor ), must be captured explicitly from the transfer function of the circuit. As we know, a transfer function will be called ideal if it is of the form .

Reference-contexts: Recently, the Pad technique has been used to get an approximated explicit analytical expression of the transfer function to evaluate charging delay of interconnect networks [60, 54, 21, 48, 64, 29]. However, the Pad technique suffers from an instability problem: unstable poles may be generated for known stable networks <ref> [16] </ref>. Instead of using the Pad technique, based on the method of inversion of Laplace transform, F. Y. Chang [19] introduced Laguerre function (or Exponentially-Decayed Polynomial Function) to approximate the impulse response functions, together with a recursive convolution formula. <p> However, it suffers two known problems. Right half plane approximate poles may be generated for known stable networks; and the approximation error depends on network topology, element values, input waveform, and output choice <ref> [16] </ref>. In order to overcome these problems, Exponentially-Decayed Polynomial Functions (EDPF) are used to approximate the transfer function of the macromodel. A -th order EDPF has the following form: (4.6) where is the time constant. <p> of Pad approximation with guaranteed stable solution. 4.4 Accuracy and Stability Issues Although the moment matching technique is a fast and simple approximation or reduction method and is widely used, there are no efficient means of determining the appropriate order of the reduced model for a desired accuracy or tolerance <ref> [16] </ref>. The reason for this is that the finite moments, which are the first several coefficients of a Taylor series expansion around some frequency point, do not have enough information about the original function along the entire frequency axis. <p> The equivalent circuit of a two port macromodel is shown in Fig. 5.2. 5.3 Stability of Macromodel As pointed out in <ref> [16, 1, 22] </ref>, the Pad approximation suffers from the instability I i Z 0 V' i Z 0 V i = 1 1 Z 0 V' i Z 0 a i S ij a j j 1= +( )= 2 0 V' i 2 0 S ij V' j j 1=

Reference-contexts: for example, the power and ground planes where all sources and drains of CMOS transistors are modelled as current sources, and for the circuits with initial conditions which may exist in the form of static charge during the idle-period of logic switching and the fetch/store transition period of memory circuits <ref> [17] </ref>. Such cases are often ignored in the transient simulations of large interconnect networks. Although Pad approximation provides a feasible and accurate model for RC circuits, it tends to yield unstable poles when the number of poles (order of approximation) exceeds seven.

Reference-contexts: While finding the explicit analytical expression of the transfer function for an arbitrary interconnect system to compute the time-of-ight is impractical, several attempts have been made to extract the time-of-ight delay. They either require an explicit analytical expression of the transfer function <ref> [18] </ref> or can only deal with one set of transmission lines [54, 10]. The extracted time-of-ight of one transmission line is also used as the lower bound of the delay for the lossy transmission lines [80, 83]. <p> This contradicts the definition: the time-of-ight is the maximum delay during which the output response is zero for a finite input signal.

In the following, we state a simplified recursive convolution formula. For the derivation of the formula, see Appendix B.

Though it is not easy to find a criteria to automatically determine the approximation order, efforts to increase approximation accuracy have been made <ref> [22, 29] </ref>. The general way is to increase the approximation order by avoiding numerical ill-condition problem. However, increasing the order usually increases reduction time and simulation time. This becomes evident for large networks with large number of external ports. The difficulty can be dealt with by partitioning. <p> The equivalent circuit of a two port macromodel is shown in Fig. 5.2. 5.3 Stability of Macromodel As pointed out in <ref> [16, 1, 22] </ref>, the Pad approximation suffers from the instability I i Z 0 V' i Z 0 V i = 1 1 Z 0 V' i Z 0 a i S ij a j j 1= +( )= 2 0 V' i 2 0 S ij V' j j 1= <p> On the other hand, trying to model the huge full matrix by lower order approximation with moment matching techniques is impractical.

The complex frequency hopping method <ref> [22] </ref> and the PVL (Pad approximation via the Lanczos process) [29] are efforts to compute high order moments while avoiding the ill-condition problem. However, increasing the approximation order will increase the modeling and simulation time. <p> Since only neighboring edges change their weights, these weights can be updated in constant time [31]. 6.2 Efficiency and Accuracy of Reduced Networks The common method to increase accuracy of modeling a large interconnect network with moment matching techniques is to increase approximation order <ref> [22, 29, 41] </ref>. This will increase the modeling and simulation time. The problem becomes evident when the number of port is very large. <p> We have introduced mixed-exponential functions to deal this problem. However, extremely ill-conditioned matrices because of the severe numerical problems may still exist when computing high order moments. The complex frequency hopping method <ref> [22] </ref> and the PVL (Pad approximation via the Lanczos process) [29] help to compute high order moments by avoiding the ill-condition problem. However, difficulty of determining approximation order with moment matching technique hinders their use. In addition, increasing the approximation order will increase the modeling and simulation time.

In this method, the scattering-matrix of the network is partitioned into blocks based on classification of internal and external ports. The scattering-matrix can be obtained using block operations including time-consuming matrix inversion. Connecting two multiports at a time from bottom up may reduce the computation time.

MEF is the combination of exponential functions and EDPF. Reference <ref> [73] </ref> gives the derivation of the recursive convolution formula of an exponential with any input function. Actually, an exponential is a special function of the 38 Norton Equivalent Circuits Based on Recursive Convolution EDPF when the order is zero.

Reference-contexts: We have proposed an efficient partitioning method to speed up the reduction and simulation. Efficient data modeling beyond moment matching methods still to be developed. Scattering-parameter-based macromodel can compute S-matrix at sampling frequency points [50]. Although least-squares, which can compute the error norm of approximation <ref> [74] </ref>, could be used, a more robust data modeling technique is needed to avoid numerical problems when the number of poles goes larger. Linear system identification technique [71] could be one of choices. Approximating the multiport macromodel is another open question.

Reference-contexts: The scattering-parameter-based macromodel has been extended to analyze sensitivity of interconnect networks <ref> [75] </ref>. The sensitivity and time-of-ight can be kept during network reduction. The technique that keeps the track of information of time-of-ight and sensitivity during reduction can be used to merge all linear independent sources, that is, the ports which are connected to those sources need not to be kept external.

Reference-contexts: When the inverter is slightly loaded, and output rise and fall time are relatively short as compared to the input rise and fall time, then the short-circuit dissipation will increase to the same order of magnitude as the dynamic dissipation <ref> [76] </ref>. Therefore, the analysis of 63 A CMOS Driver Model for Transient and Power Dissipation Analysis the short-circuit dissipation is important for the low power design. <p> When the rise time of the output voltage is comparable to the rise time of the input signal, the leakage current become significant, and the corresponding leakage dissipation will be similar in magnitude as the dynamic dissipation <ref> [76] </ref>. Previous methods of evaluating the leakage current are all based on the assumption that the load is a lumped capacitor [35, 76]. <p> Previous methods of evaluating the leakage current are all based on the assumption that the load is a lumped capacitor <ref> [35, 76] </ref>. In order to accurately estimate the leakage current of the CMOS driver with a general interconnect load, we analyze the leakage current of the nMOS transistor for the falling ramp input signal shown in Fig. 8.1.

Reference-contexts: Section 2: . As the input voltage decreases, the source to gate voltage of the pMOS transistor exceeds its threshold voltage, causing it to turn on in saturation. Thus, the pMOS current increases quadratically in this section <ref> [79] </ref>. <p> the current owing into the interconnect is (8.3) where is the maximum current that the pMOS transistor could provide, the rise time (to be precise, the fall time here) of the input signal, and the time when the pMOS transistor starts conducting current, or when the following condition is true <ref> [79] </ref>, (8.4) If the output voltage is low enough, the section 2 model is employed until the time at which the input transition reaches its final value, then switches to section 3. <p> If the output voltage goes up quickly, pMOS turns on in the linear region, the gate thus enters section 4 directly. The method to determine which case will occur is by computing , which meets the following equation <ref> [79] </ref>: (8.5) If , pMOS is in the saturation region for , the gate enters section 3 at . Otherwise, if , the pMOS turns on in the linear region at , the gate thus enters section 4 directly (See Fig. 8.2). <p> This section begins at , when the input voltage is down to zero and the pMOS transistor is still in the saturation region. A constant current source with magnitude represents the model.

When the output voltage rises to a value such that pMOS transistor enters its linear region (See Eq. (8.5)), the output current of the pMOS becomes <ref> [79] </ref> (8.9) where and . Although this region is commonly called the linear region, varies lineally with only when the quadratic term is small. Instead of modeling the remaining pMOS current in one section such as [63], we model this region into two sections.

Reference-contexts: As the time-of-ight of the signal across the interconnect is greater than, or comparable to, the input signal rise-time (i.e. long interconnects), it is most difficult to capture the time-of-ight delay with a finite order of approximation <ref> [80, 83] </ref>, whether a finite sum of exponentials [9, 54] or an exponentially decayed polynomial function [19, 49].
