Title: Portal Textures: Texture Flipbooks in A rchitectural Models

Abstract: This paper outlines a method to use (compressed) flipbooks of textures to represent portals in 3D models. A portal is a generalization of windows and doors. It connects two adjacent cells (or rooms). This method accelerates portal visibility culling by reducing the depth of portal sequences to one. Each portal of the current cell that is some distance away from the viewpoint is rendered as a texture. The portal texture returns to geometry when the viewpoint gets too close to the portal. This way all portal sequences (not too close the viewpoint) have a depth complexity of one. The size of each texture and distance at which the transition occurs is configurable for each portal.

Reference-contexts: Then, it will describe how multiple textures are sampled and how the best texture is dynamically chosen. Section 4 will explain how smooth transitions between portal texture and cell geometry are accomplished. Section 5 will describe the portal texture extension, called pfPortalTextures, to pfPortals <ref> [3] </ref>. Finally, Section 6 will end with some conclusions. 2. Portal Textures in a Cell-Partitioned Model When viewing a 3D model from a specific viewpoint, the user typically only interacts with the local geometry.

Reference-contexts: Specifying a maximum distance from the texture sample point will bound the maximum error of the portal texture representation to a specific angular deviation <ref> [5] </ref>. When this threshold is reached, the portal texture can be resampled, another precomputed texture sample can be used or the geometry can be displayed. 0 2 4 The pfPortalTextures system stores a set of textures with each portal.

Reference-contexts: The overall lighting error can be removed by using precomputed diffuse illumination models (i.e. radiosity illumination models) or flat shading. 4. Geometry-to-Texture Transitions In general texture-based simplification [4][5], the simplification process must also be concerned with performing smooth transitions when switching between geometry and texture (and vice versa) <ref> [6] </ref>. Furthermore, the boundary between the geometry and texture must maintain at least positional continuity (i.e. zero-order continuity). In the case of portal textures, the boundary between geometry and texture is not visible (since it is hidden by the wall surrounding each portal).
