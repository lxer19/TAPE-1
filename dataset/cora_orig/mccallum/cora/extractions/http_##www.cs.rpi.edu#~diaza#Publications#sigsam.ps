Reference-contexts: As a consequence of the design presented in this objectives document, the Communications Committee was created to study the lowest level of the OpenMath hierarchy, namely the "transport layer". The resulting final report <ref> [1] </ref> reveals and resolves several issues concerning the transmission of OpenMath encodings. Currently, the OpenMath design and development committee is the most active. This committee's goal is to specify the core of OpenMath via theoretical study and practical experience, in particular, the implementation and testing of prototypes (see x5).

Reference-contexts: Progress is visible through reports and/or code produced by the various committees. To date, five OpenMath workshops have convened resulting in the formation of three committees. The OpenMath Objectives committee was formed to identify and clarify the ambition of OpenMath. This committee produced the Objectives Paper <ref> [2] </ref> which states precisely the goals, purposes and a framework for the basic design of OpenMath. As a consequence of the design presented in this objectives document, the Communications Committee was created to study the lowest level of the OpenMath hierarchy, namely the "transport layer".

Reference-contexts: These new prototypes will incorporate lessons learned from the previous implementations [6]. Implementations are initially planned for a few general purpose computer algebra systems (e.g. Axiom REDUCE, Maple) , as well as a few specialized applications (e.g. Co--CoA <ref> [3] </ref>, Singular [4], techexplorer [5]). A set of simple contexts and phrase books are under development. A principal prototype is targeted for the summer of 1996, with alpha testing projected for the consequent autumn.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the semantics largely dictate the visual form, but sometimes expli cit "hints" are needed: e.g. p x and x 1=2 are usually interchangeable. OpenMath plans to support such "hints". Indeed, the developers of techexplorer <ref> [5] </ref> at IBM Research intend to support OpenMath for the distribution of mathematical objects within documents distributed via the Internet. <p> These new prototypes will incorporate lessons learned from the previous implementations [6]. Implementations are initially planned for a few general purpose computer algebra systems (e.g. Axiom REDUCE, Maple) , as well as a few specialized applications (e.g. Co--CoA [3], Singular [4], techexplorer <ref> [5] </ref>). A set of simple contexts and phrase books are under development. A principal prototype is targeted for the summer of 1996, with alpha testing projected for the consequent autumn. The next prototype is intended to be sufficient for exchanges of polynomials and similar structures between general computer algebra systems.
