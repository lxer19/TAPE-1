Abstract: In this paper, an approach is presented to incorporate problem specific knowledge into a genetic algorithm which is used to compute near-optimum solutions to traveling salesman problems (TSP). The approach is based on using a tour construction heuristic for generating the initial population, a tour improvement heuristic for finding local optima in a given TSP search space, and new genetic operators for effectively searching the space of local optima in order to find the global optimum. The quality and efficiency of solutions obtained for a set of TSP instances containing between 318 and 1400 cities are presented.

Reference-contexts: We believe that this also holds for tours produced by other improvement heuristics, such as 3-opt or LK. In support of this claim, Boese <ref> [1, 2] </ref> argues that the cost surfaces of TSPs exhibit a "big valley" structure, i.e. the optimum lies near the center of a single valley of near-optimal solutions. <p> If this distance between two individuals is zero, then these two individuals are said to be identical, because all edges of the first can be found in the second. This distance is also used in <ref> [1, 2, 20] </ref>. It can be seen as a counterpart to the Hamming distance for bitstrings. It is easy to see that the smaller the distance between two parents, the higher the probability of falling back in one of the two local minima.

In many cases, the search efficiency of the general methods is strongly increased when some form of domain knowledge about the TSP is provided to them.

Reference-contexts: The results of Johnson [13] indicate that additional implementation optimizations can reduce the runtimes drastically. Furthermore, additional tests of the proposed algorithm on other possibly more complex or asymmetric TSP instances <ref> [4] </ref> and comprehensive comparisons with other (possibly non-GA) approaches, in particular the ILK heuristic, are required to provide a detailed assessment of the merits of the proposed approach.

Reference-contexts: A new crossover operator, called MPX (maximum preservative crossover), has been proposed for recombination. The population structure also differs from the one of a traditional GA, as described by Gorges-Schleuter <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. In this approach, the improvement rate is set to 1, hence all individuals are local minima; the tour improvement operator is 2-opt. <p> Compared to the above results, the solutions are much better: for the 532-cities problem a best tour length of 0.10% and an average tour length of 0.19% above the optimum has been obtained <ref> [6] </ref>. Mathias and Whitley [18] have shown that MPX is the most suitable crossover for the TSP, since it outperforms edge-3 and several others.

Reference-contexts: For example, Grefenstette [9] used a heuristic crossover and got solutions as far as 25% above the optimum for a 50-cities TSP. In <ref> [8] </ref> he reports results of experiments with tour construction heuristics for generating the initial population as well as using a heuristic crossover and local hill-climbing as the mutation operator.

Reference-contexts: A heuristic GA template Although the integration of TSP domain knowledge into GAs according to Fig. 1 seems to be a promising approach, several previous attempts to use TSP heuristics at particular steps of the template were rather discouraging. For example, Grefenstette <ref> [9] </ref> used a heuristic crossover and got solutions as far as 25% above the optimum for a 50-cities TSP. In [8] he reports results of experiments with tour construction heuristics for generating the initial population as well as using a heuristic crossover and local hill-climbing as the mutation operator.

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, the results are better than those obtained using 2-opt. For the 532-cities instance an average tour length of 0.17% above the optimum has been found. Homaifar et al. <ref> [10] </ref> recently developed another crossover for the TSP, called matrix crossover. Using 2-opt as the improvement operator, their GA is able to find tours up to 1.96% above the optimum in case of a 318-cities problem.

Reference-contexts: Suh and van Gucht [25] have applied 2-opt to some individuals of a GA population and reached a quality of 1.73% above the optimum for a 100-cities problem. In <ref> [11] </ref>, Jog, Suh and van Gucht present better solutions for the same 100-cities problem: using 2-opt and Or-opt [15] as the tour improvement operator leads to a quality of 1.37% above the optimum on the average.

Reference-contexts: Using 2-opt as the improvement operator, their GA is able to find tours up to 1.96% above the optimum in case of a 318-cities problem. The probably most effective approach to the TSP is the one proposed by Johnson <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. His Iterated Lin-Kernighan heuristic (ILK) works as follows: a locally optimal solution produced by LK is slightly mutated by a random nonsequential 4-change [17] and LK is applied again to the modified solution. This is repeated until the results are satisfactory.

Although ILK has recently been regarded by Johnson as a "genetic" approach <ref> [13] </ref>, we do not refer to ILK as a GA since the key concepts of GAs, a population of individuals and recombination of (parts of) several individuals, are missing. In ILK, a single individual rather than a population of individuals is considered at each iteration step. <p> Our results are qualitatively superior to any of the results obtained by all other GA approaches known to us and comparable to the best non-GA approaches such as ILK; for example, the average quality produced by ILK for att532 <ref> [13] </ref> is slighly worse, but its runtimes are significantly better than ours. Actually, ILK may be regarded as a special case of our approach, since it is obtained by setting the population size and the mutation rate to 1 and the crossover rate to 0. <p> For example, the efficiency of the implementation must be increased to reduce the computation times; in particular our implementation of the Lin-Kernighan heuristic is a target for improvement, and a parallel version of the whole approach would be desirable. The results of Johnson <ref> [13] </ref> indicate that additional implementation optimizations can reduce the runtimes drastically.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem <ref> [15] </ref> in which a salesman tries to find the shortest closed tour to visit a set of N cities under the condition that each city is visited exactly once. <p> The main possibilities to augment GAs with such heuristics are as follows: Instead of generating random tours which form the individuals of the initial population of a GA, it is possible to use a tour construction heuristic, such as the nearest neighbor (NN) heuristic or various insertion heuristics <ref> [15, 24] </ref>. Since an entire population has to be created, the heuristic in use must be able to produce different tours. <p> Suh and van Gucht [25] have applied 2-opt to some individuals of a GA population and reached a quality of 1.73% above the optimum for a 100-cities problem. In [11], Jog, Suh and van Gucht present better solutions for the same 100-cities problem: using 2-opt and Or-opt <ref> [15] </ref> as the tour improvement operator leads to a quality of 1.37% above the optimum on the average. However, the results obtained with these heuristic GA approaches are still rather poor when compared to conventional heuristics.
