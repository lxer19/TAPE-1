Title: Shared autonomy in a robot hand teleoperation system

Abstract: This paper considers adding autonomy to robot hands used in teleoperation systems. Currently, the finger positions of robot hands in teleoperation systems are controlled via a robot master using a Dataglove or exoskeleton. There are several difficulties with this approach: accurate calibration is hard to achieve; robot hands have different capabilities from human hands; and complex force reflection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a model of hand teleoperation in which the input device commands the motions of a grasped object rather than the joint displacements of the fingers. To achieve this goal, the hand requires greater autonomy and the capability to perform high-level functions with minimal external input. Therefore, a set of general, primitive manipulation functions that can be performed automatically is defined. These elementary functions control simple rotations and translations of the grasped objects. They are incorporated into a teleoperation system by using a simple input device as a control signal. Preliminary implementations with a Utah/MIT are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on the coordination of two-arm manipulation has discussed master/slave control for quasistatic manipulation (Kopf and Tetsura [12]). The selection vectors for the master and slave fingers, S m and S s , are: S m = [0; 0; 0] T and S s = <ref> [1; 0; 0] </ref> T . In master/slave control, there is no communication between the two fingers. As the master finger pushes, the slave finger reacts solely to the sensed motion of the grasped object. Hybrid force/position control enables the hand to maintain grasp stability during manipulation. <p> A general finite state machine is shown in The system at Columbia University currently uses a keyboard and monitor to control the hand system and re Michelman and Allen IROS # A-1069 6 lay information to the master. The system is described in Allen et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. The elementary manipulation functions outlined in the preceding section have been implemented and work autonomously. hand to control the applied finger forces in some directions and the The Utah/MIT hand includes an analog position controller, but no method to control applied finger forces.

Reference-contexts: Without a high-level function, it is difficult to enhance a robot's autonomy. Furthermore, in situations in which there are long communication delays between the master and the robot (greater than 1 second), it is useful for the robot to perform certain functions au tonomously (Bejczy and Kim <ref> [2] </ref>). 5. High degree-of-freedom force feedback is still experimental and expensive. Burdea et al. [4], however, have developed a hand master that returns the grasping forces in three directions to the user.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 (4) illustrates a common strategy used to rotate rectangular objects with the fingertips, the twiddle manipulation. Figure 2 (5) is the pivot rotation, an example of using controlled slip (Brock <ref> [3] </ref>). A final rolling strategy is shown in Figure 2 (6), in which the contacts cause a rectangular object to rotate around the circumference of a finger, a variant of the twiddle rotation. As noted above, each of these strategies can be used in different start configurations.

Reference-contexts: Generally, the finger positions of the human master are translated to the robot and visual or force feedback are returned from the robot to the master. (See Speeter et al. [21, 18], Burdea et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, Hong and Tan [8]). There are several difficulties with this approach: 1.

Burdea et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, however, have developed a hand master that returns the grasping forces in three directions to the user. The traditional means of control is manual control, in which the interface between the robot and the user primarily transfers data and performs coordinate transformations.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there are only two main patterns and two subsidiary patterns (p. 75). Other researchers have taken claimed more than these few patterns in manipulation. The biologist Bernard Campbell <ref> [5] </ref> stated that there are fifty-eight basic manipulation motions. The take-off point is that there is a limited set. of tasks. For example, the same motions used to turn the top of a jar may be used to turn a screwdriver.

Reference-contexts: Task partitioning is used to control the grasping force easily. Normally, one finger (or virtual finger, Iberall <ref> [9] </ref>) remains rigid in the direction of the grasp and the opposing finger modulates the grasping force.

Reference-contexts: For example, Hong and Tan [8] developed a complex three-step process each user must repeat. 2. The capabilities of robot hands are different from those of human hands. For example, the human hand can translate objects along only a single axis while a hand such as the Utah/MIT <ref> [10] </ref> hand has the ability to translate objects in three Cartesian directions. Using a Dataglove thus reduces the ma nipulatory capabilities of the robot hand. 3. Controlling the many degrees of freedom of these hands (e.g., 16 degrees of freedom for the Utah/MIT hand) requires high-bandwidth communication. 4.

These manipulations (described in Michelman [15]), which the hand performs autonomously, are translations and rotations of objects with circular and rectangular cross sections.

Reference-contexts: The control of the pushing finger is based on position error, while the slave finger control is based on force errors. Previous work on the coordination of two-arm manipulation has discussed master/slave control for quasistatic manipulation (Kopf and Tetsura <ref> [12] </ref>). The selection vectors for the master and slave fingers, S m and S s , are: S m = [0; 0; 0] T and S s = [1; 0; 0] T . In master/slave control, there is no communication between the two fingers.

Reference-contexts: The individual fingers in a manipulation are given specific roles in a manipulation. The roles can often be described using C-surface specifications (Mason <ref> [13] </ref>) and implemented with a hybrid position/force controller (Raibert and Craig [19]). For example, suppose the task is to rotate a cylinder with two fingers.

Reference-contexts: Here the internal grasping forces are seen clearly from the equilibrium condition: f 0y + f 1y = 0, where f 0y is the component of the thumb's contact force in the y direction. There are an infinite number of solutions for the internal grasping forces (Salisbury <ref> [14] </ref>), and the selection of internal grasping forces is an active area of research. For the simple two-contact case, in which the forces are diametrically opposed to each other, the grasping forces are always equal and opposite.

These manipulations (described in Michelman <ref> [15] </ref>), which the hand performs autonomously, are translations and rotations of objects with circular and rectangular cross sections. It is assumed that all finger contacts are on the fingertips and that motions are performed slowly enough to allow quasistatic analysis of forces to be used. <p> After the grasp is established, the input device controls object manipulation purely. Since the manipulation primitives control only a single rotational or translational degree of freedom of a grasped object, the mapping from the input device is straightforward. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the autonomous functions are described. For teleoperation, the internal command signals are replaced by the external master control of the teleoperator.

Reference-contexts: There seems to be a limited number of the types of manipulations that a person can perform. Napier <ref> [17] </ref> has written of human hands: Considering the enormous variety of activities that the hand is called upon to perform, it might be supposed that prehensile movements would be too numerous for simple analysis.

Currently, feedback information during grasp is relayed numerically to the user. Single-axis force reflection is a desirable enhancement to the system and could possibly be achieved with a joystick. Anthropomorphic, dextrous robot hands have been developed to be used with teleoperation control systems.
