Reference-contexts: However, the corresponding network of type N E,FCFS is a product-form network (more specifically it can be modeled as a classed Jackson queueing network) and the average packet delay is easy to determine for networks of this type ([8], <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Likewise, define N C,PS to be the queueing network N where the service time at server s is a constant c s and the contention resolution protocol is processor-sharing. Harchol-Balter and Wolfe, <ref> [3] </ref>, demonstrate that many real-world packet-routing networks can be modeled by queueing networks of type N C,FCFS . <p> In this section we discuss which networks which satisfy this easy test. We make two points: 1. We demonstrate a class of networks with non-Markovian routing which satisfies the test for being in S Light . (Because the routing is not Marko-vian, the result in <ref> [3] </ref> on networks in S does not apply to these networks.) 2. In [3], a network N is constructed for which the expected delay in the case of two packets is significantly greater in N C,FCFS than in N C,PS . <p> We make two points: 1. We demonstrate a class of networks with non-Markovian routing which satisfies the test for being in S Light . (Because the routing is not Marko-vian, the result in <ref> [3] </ref> on networks in S does not apply to these networks.) 2. In [3], a network N is constructed for which the expected delay in the case of two packets is significantly greater in N C,FCFS than in N C,PS . This property is highly dependent on the fact N 's servers have different service times. <p> If in the above proof the routes had crossed repeatedly, it is possible that the two packets in N C,FCFS might meet repeatedly with high probability and the two packets in N C,PS might never meet again, resulting in greater average delay for N C,FCFS . <ref> [3] </ref> shows such an example involving servers with different service times, where the expected delay in the case of two packets is fi (n) for N C,FCFS and only fi (1) for N C,PS , where n is the number of servers in N .

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the significance of the above result is that it suggests that many more networks are contained in S than has already been proven. Reiman and Simon ([6], <ref> [7] </ref>) prove a light traffic result which is somewhat similar to ours, as well as many other light traffic results. Their technique involves computing derivatives of the delay at the point of zero arrival rate.
