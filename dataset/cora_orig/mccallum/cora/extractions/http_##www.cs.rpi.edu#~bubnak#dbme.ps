Abstract: Many problems in computer vision require estimation of both model parameters and boundaries, which limits the usefulness of standard estimation techniques from statistics. Example problems include surface reconstruction from range data, estimation of parametric motion models, fitting circular or elliptic arcs to edgel data, and many others. This paper introduces a new estimation technique, called the Domain Bounding M-Estimator, which is a generalization of ordinary M-estimators combining error measures on model parameters and boundaries in a joint, robust objective function. Minimization of the objective function given a rough initialization yields simultaneous estimates of parameters and boundaries. The DBM-Estimator has been applied to estimating line segments, surfaces, and the symmetry transformation between two edgel chains. It is unaffected by outliers and prevents boundary estimates from crossing even small magnitude discontinuities.

For 2D domains, this growth is similar to that of a balloon model <ref> [6] </ref> with no need to simulate an artificial force! * The DBM-Estimator inherits local robustness properties of standard M-estimators while avoiding their susceptibility to leverage points, which causes their poor global robustness (breakdown point). * Domain growth is determined by the cumulative effect of points in small regions near the domain <p> Segments growing too large are split; those shrinking too small are merged. Changes in topology are detected and corrected along the polygons [17]. The overall effect is similar to that of a snake or balloon model <ref> [6, 16] </ref>, without any simulation of artificial forces. Currently there is no smoothing of the DBM-Estimator boundary polygon, so it appears jagged.

Reference-contexts: This means the objective function does not need to be tuned to the tail of the error distribution to ensure proper domain growth <ref> [19] </ref>, allowing the DBM-Estimator to distinguish between noise and small scale discontinuities. An example illustrating the behavior of the DBM-Estimator is shown in Fig. 1. Despite its advantages, the DBM-Estimator does have limitations. <p> See Sec. 6 for an example of the effect of this. Third, s, whether estimated or fixed externally, should not be used directly in calculating the scale normalized residual u i for points in W (D). The calculation of u i must instead use prediction interval techniques <ref> [19] </ref> to factor in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters. <p> Observe that currently the results show double boundaries at discontinuities because adjacent domain estimates are unrelated.
