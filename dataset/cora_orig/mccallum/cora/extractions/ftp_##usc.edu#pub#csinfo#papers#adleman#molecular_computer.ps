Address: Los Angeles, California 90089, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Southern California  
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that under some circumstances computers based on molecular interactions may be a viable alternative to computers based on electronics. Here, some practical aspects of constructing a molecular computer are considered.

It was asserted that for certain problems, molecular computers might compete with electronic computers. At the time that [Ad] appeared, there seemed to be formidable obstructions to creating a practical molecular computer. <p> It is likely that some computational problems which can be efficiently handled using the unrestricted model cannot be efficiently handled using the restricted model. However, it is hoped that the restricted model will be more easily implemented. First, despite its use in <ref> [Ad] </ref>, the Amplify operation is a concern. Amplification is a complex and rare process. Currently, it can be only be applied to certain special biological molecules (e.g. DNA and RNA) and some living things (e.g. E. coli., phages). <p> For example, the magnetic bead system employed in <ref> [Ad] </ref>, or an affinity column. If a Detect is required on a tube T , then PCR with primers appropriate for the common 5' and 3' sequences is performed followed by gel electrophoresis. <p> While this is a rather large quantity by the standards of current molecular biology, there do not seem to be reasons in principle why dealing with such quantities would not be feasible in practice. To create T one could proceed as described in [Li] using the methods of <ref> [Ad] </ref> (see also [BS]). Alternatively, it is possible to proceed in the following manner well known in `combinatorial chemistry' [Al]. First, all of the O i are produced separately. Initially, approximately 2 70 , O 5 0 are placed in tube T . <p> If the final tube contained many DNA molecules (i.e. if there were many truth assignments which satisfied ) then the detect operation could be performed with coarser techniques such as optical density measurement. Performing separations might be done using the magnetic bead system of <ref> [Ad] </ref>. Each bead is approximately 1 micron in diameter and has a mass of approximately 1.3 pg. Each bead can bind approximately 7:8 fi 10 5 biotinylated oli-gos.

Reference-contexts: This is an informal, speculative `work in progress' which refelects the author's impressions as of January 1995. y Research supported by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-9214671. email: adleman@cs.usc.edu. 1 Happily, there has been rapid and significant progress toward overcoming these obstructions. Lipton <ref> [Li] </ref> has directly addressed the question of versatility by demonstrating a large class of computational problems which are apparently amenable to molecular computation. <p> In the sections which follow physical incarnations of some of these models are given. The reader most interested in practical issues may wish to go immediately to An Example Application: in section 3. We begin with the model described in <ref> [Li] </ref>. The Unrestricted (DNA) Model: A (test) tube is a set of molecules of DNA (i.e. a multi-set of finite strings over the alphabet fA; C; G; T g). Given a tube, one can perform the following operations: 1. <p> Hence the restricted program answers the 3-colorability problem for the graph G in `linear' time (in the number of edges) while an electronic compute might require exponential time. This is the value of parallelism, each steps act on as many as 3 n inputs simultaneously. Lipton <ref> [Li] </ref> gives a method for efficiently solving the well known (NP-complete) `satisfiability problem': given a propositional formula (not necessarily in conjunctive normal form) decide if it is satisfiable. <p> While this is a rather large quantity by the standards of current molecular biology, there do not seem to be reasons in principle why dealing with such quantities would not be feasible in practice. To create T one could proceed as described in <ref> [Li] </ref> using the methods of [Ad] (see also [BS]). Alternatively, it is possible to proceed in the following manner well known in `combinatorial chemistry' [Al]. First, all of the O i are produced separately. Initially, approximately 2 70 , O 5 0 are placed in tube T .

Following the example a potential application of a computational concepts is described. Recently, Bartel and Szostak <ref> [BS] </ref> have used the methods of combinatorial chemistry to make what might be called a `pseudo-enzyme'. We will describe their basic approach briefly. For the sake of clarity many simplifications will be made and many important details will be omitted. <p> For example P A would be all 25-mers which begin with A (there would be a total of 4 24 ), and P ACCU would be all 25-mers which begin with ACCU (there would be a total of 4 21 ). One can begin as in <ref> [BS] </ref> by creating an RNA pool consisting of all 25-mers (i.e. begin with P ). One then incubates P , and excess ffi 1 and ffi 2 in an appropriate buffer. <p> Further, by doing the incubation under `unfavorable' conditions where only the `best' winners will have a chance to act, the need for `evolving' the answer as done for example in <ref> [BS] </ref> might be removed and this should save considerable time.

Initially, approximately 2 70 , O 5 0 are placed in tube T . <p> The ability to create molecules with desired properties (e.g. enzymes, drugs) `on demand' is of great importance in these areas. Historically, the process of creating such molecules has been difficult (if possible at all) and expensive. Very recently, a new promising approach to this problem, called `combinatorial chemistry' <ref> [Al] </ref>, has arisen. Below is an example of its use. It should be clear that combinatorial chemistry is closely related to molecular computation. It seems possible that concepts useful in designing molecular comput 16 ers may be of value in combinatorial chemistry and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: There appear to be reasons to be optimistic about the existence of such systems. It may be possible to detect single molecules in solution using fluorescence labeling <ref> [ER] </ref>. It appears that physicists are able to detect a single subatomic event in a huge volume of space when 15 detecting neutrinos. Another operation which might be considered in a molecular computer is Describe. Roughly, decode a molecule back into the set of symbols it encodes.
