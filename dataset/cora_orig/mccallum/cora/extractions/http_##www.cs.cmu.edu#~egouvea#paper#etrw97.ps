Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: Speech recognition systems perform poorly on speech degraded by even simple effects such as linear filtering and additive noise. One solution to this problem is to modify the probability density function (PDF) of clean speech to account for the effects of the degradation. However, even for the case of linear filtering and additive noise, it is extremely difficult to do this analytically. Previously-attempted analytical solutions for the problem of noisy speech recognition have either used an overly-simplified mathematical description of the effects of noise on the statistics of speech, or they have relied on the availability of large environment-specific adaptation sets. In this paper we present the Vector Polynomial approximationS (VPS) method to compensate for the effects of linear filtering and additive noise on the PDF of clean speech. VPS also estimates the parameters of the environment, namely the noise and the channel, by using statistically linearized approximations of these effects. We evaluate the performance of this method (VPS) using the CMU SPHINX-II system on the alphanumeric CENSUS database corrupted with artificial white Gaussian noise. VPS provides improvements of up to 15 percent in relative recognition accuracy over our previous best algorithm, VTS, while being up to 20 percent more computationally efficient.

Reference-contexts: Such compensation algorithms tend to be based on an analytic characterization of the nature of the degradation, rather than a mere empirical characterization of a lar ge number of examples. The CDCN algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> is an example of this class of model- based algorithms that has been applied with success to several databases. <p> EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The effectiveness of the VPS algorithm was evaluated by artificially contaminating utterances from the CMU census database <ref> [3] </ref> with white noise at different SNRs.

Reference-contexts: Estimation Of Environment Parameters The statistics of clean speech can be modeled as a mixture of Gaussian distributions as specified in Eq. (4). The parameters describing these statistics are estimated using basic EM methods. In previous work <ref> [4] </ref>, it was shown that it is reasonable for Gaussian densities for clean speech to be assumed to transform into Gaussian densities for noisy speech.

Reference-contexts: Many of these environment compensation algorithms take advantage of the availability of stereo data, i.e. speech databases that are simultaneously recorded in high-quality and degraded environments (e.g. [1][2]). Other algorithms make use of non- simultaneously-recorded adaptation data from the degraded environment (e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>). Still other algorithms ( e.g. [6]) use knowledge of noise statistics and extensive computation to adapt the HMMs of clean speech to a new environment. Unfortunately, stereo data, a priori knowledge about the testing environment, and/or the computational resource requirements needed for such algorithms are frequently unavailable. <p> We used the SPHINX-II continuous speech recognition system. In Figure 4 we compare the effectiveness of the VPS algorithm to the effectiveness of other model-based compensation algorithms, CDCN [3] and VTS [7] (which do not require stereo data), and RATZ <ref> [5] </ref> (our best empirical algorithm that compensates input speech feature vectors using stereo data). The VPS algorithm outperforms CDCN and RATZ at all SNRs, and it provides an improvement in relative recognition accuracy of up to 15 percent compared to VTS.

The estimates for the mean and variance can be improved by using better approximations for the environment function and the Gaussian densities. 6.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the CDCN algorithm has some limitations in that it does not model the ef fects of the environment on the variance of speech distributions, and that the noise is estimated with only limited accuracy at low SNRs. In <ref> [7] </ref> we introduced a Vector Taylor Series (VTS) method, which approximated the environment function by a T aylor series truncated after two terms, resulting in a straight line approximation. <p> We compare statistics of these noisy data with results obtained using the VPS method, as well as results obtained from using a first order Taylor series approximation, as in <ref> [7] </ref>. can be approximated extremely well by VPS. In this figure we show the mean of the simulated noisy input signal, as well as the mean computed using the polynomial approximation and the first-order vector Taylor series expansion referred to as VTS (cf. [7]). <p> first order Taylor series approximation, as in <ref> [7] </ref>. can be approximated extremely well by VPS. In this figure we show the mean of the simulated noisy input signal, as well as the mean computed using the polynomial approximation and the first-order vector Taylor series expansion referred to as VTS (cf. [7]). As we see, the Taylor series provides a reasonably good approximation, but the polynomial approximation outperforms it and cannot be distinguished from the actual mean itself. Similarly, in Figure 3 we present the VPS and first-order Taylor series approximations to the variance. <p> We used the SPHINX-II continuous speech recognition system. In Figure 4 we compare the effectiveness of the VPS algorithm to the effectiveness of other model-based compensation algorithms, CDCN [3] and VTS <ref> [7] </ref> (which do not require stereo data), and RATZ [5] (our best empirical algorithm that compensates input speech feature vectors using stereo data). The VPS algorithm outperforms CDCN and RATZ at all SNRs, and it provides an improvement in relative recognition accuracy of up to 15 percent compared to VTS.
