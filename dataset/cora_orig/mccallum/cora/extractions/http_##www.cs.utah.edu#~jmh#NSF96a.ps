Abstract: The objective of this project is to add a haptic interface to a CAD design system, so that a user can actively touch and manipulate parts as well as passively see them on a CRT screen. The Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master, a 10 degree-of-freedom force-reflecting hydraulic exoskeleton, is being interfaced to ff1, Utah's CAD system. The interaction between haptic interface and CAD system imposes stringent real-time requirements on collision detection with surface models and dynamical simulation to generate contact forces and virtual object motions. The aim of virtual prototyping is to allow a designer to interact with an assembly of parts in a "virtual" manner, prior to creation of any physical prototypes. Our contribution to this goal is the incorporation of a haptic interface into a CAD system, so that a designer will be able to touch, hold, and move models of parts and assemblies as well as see them in rendered views. The result will be an environment in which part interactions can be considered in a more natural manner than is possible with current technology. Creating a haptic interface for virtual prototyping systems involves four main problems. (1) Collision detection determines contact and interference between separate parts of the virtual prototype and between the prototype and the end effector used to manipulate the prototype. Rapid hierarchical algorithms for this computation are beginning to appear [2]. (2) Dynamical simulation computes the time evolution of assemblies in response to forces, such as applied virtually by the haptic interface, and the reaction force reflected back to the haptic interface. Approaches in the literature divide between constraint-based [1] and impulse-based [5]. (3) Visual rendering creates realistic views of configuration of parts. Rapid hierarchical algorithms for rendering of complex scenes are also beginning to appear [4]. (4) Haptic rendering gives the user a realistic sensation of touching and manipulating physical objects. To avoid severe bandwidth requirements on the haptic interface to reflect faithfully high-frequency contact transients, advantage is taken of human perceptual limitations and illusions in presenting hard contact, friction, etc. [6,7].
