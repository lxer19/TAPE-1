Reference-contexts: The idea of integrated documentation was born with the development of the T E X program; it was crystallized in Pascal with the Web system. The advantages of this method are plain to see (it's easy to make comparisons <ref> [2] </ref>). Since this development, systems similar to Web have been developed for other programming languages. But for one of the most complicated programming languages (T E X) the documentation has however been neglected.

Reference-contexts: The next line consists of the L A T E X definition of "par used in "verbatim and should result in blank lines being shown as blank lines. 28 "blank@linefalse "def"par-"ifblank@line 29 "leavevmode"fi 30 "blank@linetrue"@@par 31 "penalty"interlinepenalty-What use is this definition of "par ? We use the macro "obeylines of <ref> [3] </ref> which changes all ^^M to "par so that each can control its own indentation. Next we must also ensure that all special signs are normalized; that is, they must be given "catcode 12. 15 The font change has to be placed after the "item.

Reference-contexts: This prevents the generation of an unnecessary .idx file. 2.8 Producing the actual index entries Several of the aforementioned macros will produce some sort of index entries. These entries have to be sorted by an external program|the current implementation assumes that the makeindex program by Chen <ref> [4] </ref> is used. But this isn't built in: one has only to redefine some of the following macros to be able to use any other index program. All macros which are installation dependent are defined in such a way that they won't overwrite a previous definition. <p> With the default definitions of "SpecialMainIndex, etc., the index file generated is intended to be processed by Chen's makeindex program <ref> [4] </ref>. Of course, in this package file itself we've sometimes had to make | take the role of T E X's escape character to introduce command names at places where " has to belong to some other category.

Reference-contexts: If your macros "catcode anything other than @ to `letter', you should redefine"MakePrivateLetters "MakePrivateLetters so that it also makes the relevant characters `letters' for the benefit of the indexing. The default definition is just "makeatletter. The `module' directives of the docstrip system <ref> [6] </ref> are normally recognised and"DontCheckModules "CheckModules "Module "AltMacroFont invoke special formatting. This can be turned on and off in the .dtx file or the 14 There are two percent signs in each line. <p> at the start of each macrocode line to check whether it starts with module information. (Such information is of the form %&lt;hswitchi&gt;, where the % must be at the start of the line and hswitchi comprises names with various possible separators and a possible leading +, -, * or / <ref> [6] </ref>.
