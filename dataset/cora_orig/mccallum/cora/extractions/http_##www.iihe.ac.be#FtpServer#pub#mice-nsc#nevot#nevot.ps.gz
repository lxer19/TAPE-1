Abstract: NEVOT (Network Voice Terminal) is a media agent that provides packet-voice communications across internetworks. It operates in either unicast, simulated multicast or IP multicast environments, using the vat or RTP protocols. NEVOT is part of the SPOKES conferencing systems that allows to create flexible multimedia applications from independent components. This document describes installation, operation and implementation of NEVOT.

Reference-contexts: This division into modules simplifies the creation of integrated multimedia applications consisting of several media handlers. For example, a single join panel could be used to create both audio and video sessions. The basic approach is outlined in <ref> [2] </ref>. Other uses include the integration of the media handler with WorldWide Web browsers such as Mosaic. The daemon could also be modified to be integrated as a library into other applications or as a CORBA server. <p> In SunOS, for example, a separate device /dev/audioctl may be used to set these parameters through ioctl () calls. In NEVOT, this functionality is handled by external applications. 10.8 Program Control NEVOT is controlled through ASCII commands <ref> [2] </ref>. Depending on the configuration variable controller, these commands can come through a TCP port (with NEVOT connecting to the given port), a UDP port, or stdio.

Reference-contexts: The daemon could also be modified to be integrated as a library into other applications or as a CORBA server.

Reference-contexts: The reference count is used when attaching a single copy of an audio mbuf to several different sessions. 10.2 Control Data: The Session Protocol NEVOT can use either the RTCP or vat session protocol. The RTP session protocol (RTCP) is described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Only the sending side needs to be configured for the desired session protocol. NEVOT handles sessions with a mixture of RTCP or vat-speaking members.

Reference-contexts: Its main purpose is to suppress background noise and reduce network load during multi-participant conferences. The adaptive silence detector is borrowed from the VT (voice tool) and described in <ref> [7, p. 6,7] </ref>. It computes a measure reflecting the average sample amplitude of the packet and declares it silent if this energy measure is below the current threshold.

Reference-contexts: For -law audio, the energy measure is the average of the sign-stripped sample values and is really a geometric mean since the sum of logarithms is equivalent to the product of the sample values). The geometric average is known to be no greater than the mean <ref> [8, p. 293] </ref>. For linearly encoded audio, we apply a -law transformation to the sample average so that we again arrive at scaled amplitude values of between 0 and 127.

Reference-contexts: Other, more elaborate voice activity detectors, could be used. Of particular interest is the one used in the GSM audio codec, as it is based on energy measures and spectral information already computed within the GSM codec <ref> [9] </ref>. 3 This change from the original design avoids drop outs during sustained audio material, e.g., orchestral music. 21 A somewhat simpler, non-adaptive silence detector is used by ivs: If any -law sample within the audio packet exceeds a given threshold, the packet is declared non-silent. <p> System [5]. * SNMP management interface (to monitor QoS parameters). * Achieve audio and video synchronization using RTP timestamps and pmm. * Stereo location of audio sources [16-21] * Echo suppression and/or cancellation [22], using either the workstation CPU or the external digital signal processors. * Implement GSM silence suppression <ref> [9] </ref>. * Encoding of recorded audio files. * Distributed (prioritized FCFS) or centralized (token) floor control using session control packets. * True LPC-10 audio encoding. * Drag-and-drop for audio output files * Transparent switch from unicast UDP to multicast UDP if conference expands beyond two parties. * Display mugshot of users

Reference-contexts: The delay variance is estimated as the absolute difference between the current estimated mean delay and the delay sample. The first absolute moment is considered a more robust estimator and not as sensitive to outliers as the standard deviation. For normal random variables, it is known <ref> [10, p. 111] </ref> that E [jxj] = oe 2= = 0:798oe: Note that this differs from the conclusion drawn in [11, p. 325].

The same basic filter is used by TCP in the round trip time estimator [14, p. 188,192], [15, p. 278] and was suggested by Van Jacobson <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: When a session member is about to be deleted, the array is cleansed of any pointers to it. 10.5 Audio Encoding The most common audio encoding is -law companding. The -law transfer characteristic is given by <ref> [12] </ref> c (x) = x m 1 + where c (x) is the coded value corresponding to input x, with the maximum absolute value of x given by x m . has a value of 255. The companding gain is given by = log (1 + ).
