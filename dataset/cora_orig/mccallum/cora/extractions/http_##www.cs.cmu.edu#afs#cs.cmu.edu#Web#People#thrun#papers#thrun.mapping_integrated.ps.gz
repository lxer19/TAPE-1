Abstract: The problem of concurrent mapping and localization has received considerable attention in the mobile robotics community. Existing approaches can largely be grouped into two distinct paradigms: topological and metric. This paper proposes a method that integrates both. It poses the mapping problem as a statistical maximum likelihood problem, and devises an efficient algorithm for search in likelihood space. It presents an novel mapping algorithm that integrates two phases: a topological and a metric mapping phase. The topological mapping phase solves a global position alignment problem between potentially indistinguishable, significant places. The subsequent metric mapping phase produces a fine-grained metric map of the environment in floating-point resolution. The approach is demonstrated empirically to scale up to large, cyclic, and highly ambiguous environments.

Reference-contexts: Our definition of significant places follows closely the notion of distinctive places in Kuipers's Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (Kuipers & Byun 1991), and the notion of meetpoints in Choset's Generalized Voronoi Graphs <ref> (Choset 1996) </ref>. In our experiments, we simulated these methods by manually pressing a button whenever the robot crossed a significant place. To test the most general (and difficult) case, our approach assumes that the significant places are indistinguishable.

Reference-contexts: Maps will be denoted by m = fm x;y g x;y . A map is an assignment of properties m x;y to each x-y-locations in the world. In topological approaches to mapping, the properties-of-interest are usually locations of landmarks <ref> (Chown, Kaplan, & Kortenkamp 1995) </ref> or, alternatively, location of significant places (Kuipers & Byun 1991; Choset 1996). Metric approaches, on the other hand, usually use the location of obstacles as properties-of-interest (Chatila & Laumond 1985; Moravec 1988; Lu & Milios 1997).

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, there exists an efficient and well-understood technique for hill-climbing in likelihood space: the EM algorithm <ref> (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin 1977) </ref>, which in the context of Hidden Markov Models is often referred to as Baum-Welch or alpha-beta algorithm (Rabiner & Juang 1986). EM is a hill-climbing routine in likelihood space, which alternates two steps, an expectation step (E-step) and a maximization step (M-step).

Reference-contexts: In the topological mapping step, the robot can only observe whether or not it is at a significant place. Our definition of significant places follows closely the notion of distinctive places in Kuipers's Spatial Semantic Hierarchy <ref> (Kuipers & Byun 1991) </ref>, and the notion of meetpoints in Choset's Generalized Voronoi Graphs (Choset 1996).

Reference-contexts: Gaus-sians have a dual advantage: First they permit determining robot poses and location of obstacles with floating-point resolution, yielding high-resolution maps. Second, they make possible to apply highly efficient linear programming methods when maximizing the likelihood function <ref> (Lu & Milios 1997) </ref>. However, Gaussians are uni-modal; Thus, the metric mapper cannot represent two distinct hypothesis, as can the topological mapper. <p> Our approach differs from most work in the field (see also the surveys in (Thrun 1998; Lu & Milios 1997)) in two important technical aspects. First, robot poses are revised forward and backwards in timeas pointed out by Lu and Milios <ref> (Lu & Milios 1997) </ref>, most existing approach do not revise pose estimations backwards in time. Second, by using probabilistic representations, the approach considers multiple hypotheses as to where a robot might have been, which facilitates the recovery from errors.
