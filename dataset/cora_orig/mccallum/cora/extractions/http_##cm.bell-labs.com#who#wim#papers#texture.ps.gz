Title: Spherical Wavelets: Texture Processing

Abstract: Wavelets are a powerful tool for planar image processing. The resulting algorithms are straightforward, fast, and efficient. With the recently developed spherical wavelets this framework can be transposed to spherical textures. We describe a class of processing operators which are diagonal in the wavelet basis and which can be used for smoothing and enhancement. Since the wavelets (filters) are local in space and frequency, complex localized constraints and spatially varying characteristics can be incorporated easily. Examples from environment mapping and the manipulation of topography/bathymetry data are given.

Reference-contexts: Environment mapping images were ray traced while the texture mapping images were rendered with RenderMan. 4.1 Environment Mapping A common technique employed in the rendering of highly reflective objects is the use of an environment map <ref> [2] </ref>. In this technique the radiance reflected across a mirror like surface in the direction of the viewer is approximated by a table lookup in a texture map. The texture map corresponds to a sphere at infinity, giving the incoming radiance as a function of direction.

The main difficulty in applying these techniques to environment maps is that we seek to filter a spherical map, not a planar one.

Reference-contexts: An environment map is typically given as a cubic map, i.e., as six faces of a cube. Since the reflection vector is used as an index into these maps they are effectively point sampled. As with all point sampling techniques care must be taken to avoid aliasing artifacts. Greene <ref> [9] </ref> suggested the use of MIP maps [19] on each face of the cubic map. The basic idea of a MIP map is to build an image pyramid by recursive averaging over 4 neighboring pixels. <p> Another application of appropriately filtered environment maps is the approximation of glossy (or mixed diffuse and directional) reflection as pointed out by Greene <ref> [9] </ref>. Assume a BRDF which is centered around the mirror direction with a symmetric falloff away from it. Integrating such a BRDF against the environment map is equivalent to the convolution of the map with an appropriately shaped filter. <p> Integrating such a BRDF against the environment map is equivalent to the convolution of the map with an appropriately shaped filter. For simple reflection models these convolutions can be precomputed, in effect resulting in an appropriately smoothed environment map.

Reference-contexts: The problems are exacerbated by the fact that proper filtering of a cubic map implies spatially variant filtering, since the desired filter is a function of the distortion between the sphere of directions and its cubic projection. To address this problem, Greene and Heckbert <ref> [10] </ref> proposed the use of weighted elliptical average filters. They did not, however, use prefiltered environment maps but instead computed each convolution directly.

Reference-contexts: Once in the wavelet domain, operators such as smoothing, enhancement, edge finding, and noise removal can be performed in a straightforward fashion. Recently, the authors introduced a construction of wavelets on the sphere <ref> [15] </ref>. Having a fast wavelet transform on the sphere and a family of wavelets with various properties to choose from, the present paper considers their use in the processing of spherical texture maps. Examples of such textures in computer graphics include environment maps 1 and textures on spheres. <p> Next we explain the construction of spherical wavelets. We limit ourselves to the construction of bases arising from interpolating subdivision schemes. Other constructions are described in <ref> [15] </ref>. We present the fast spherical wavelet transform and its implementation. level 0) and the next 2 subdivision levels. Successivelevels are generated cutting each triangle into four children. <p> Successivelevels are generated cutting each triangle into four children. This is accomplished by adding vertices at the midpoint of edges and connecting them with geodetics. 2.1 Subdividing a Sphere The construction of spherical wavelets in <ref> [15] </ref> relies on a recursive partitioning of the sphere into spherical triangles. This is done starting from a Platonic solid of triangles and recursive subdivision of the triangles (see Figure 1) and is known as the geodesic sphere construction [6].

Spherical wavelets are not formed as translates and dilates of one particular function. In fact they are a typical example of socalled second generation wavelets <ref> [17] </ref>. The idea behind this development is precisely to give up the translation and dilation structure of wavelets, without compromising on the desirable aspects such as localization and fast transforms. This allows construction of wavelets in much more general settings.
