Reference-contexts: Recent studies in the field of IR and human-computer interaction have shown that small changes in the layout have a significant impact on the performance of humans when using such a system (e.g., <ref> [All94] </ref>). When databases with complex object structures are used in an interactive mode, layout structure will also be an important issue. For retrieving objects, queries may specify conditions on all three structures of objects.

Reference-contexts: For multimedia IR, vague predicates are even more important, since term-based approaches can hardly be used in such an environment; instead, similarity of values (i.e., vague equality) plays a major role. <ref> [Fal96] </ref> describes a rather general approach for dealing with similarity of multimedia data types such as time series or images, along with an access structure that allows for efficient processing. Given this concept of data types with vague predicates, the specification of the conceptual level of IR systems is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: The only differences are the construction of event expressions for result tuples during the evaluation process and the final computation of the tuple probabilities. 4.3 A probabilistic NF2 model As a step towards increased data modelling capability, we developed a probabilistic nested relational model (probabilistic non-first-normal-form, or pNF2 for short) <ref> [FR96a] </ref>. Using the NF2 model (instead of flat relations) for IR has been proposed by several authors, e.g., [SP82].

Reference-contexts: In order to arrive at a model that can be implemented and also satisfies the needs of typical applications, one has to take a data model from the DB field and generalize it so that it also comprises probabilistic inference. 4.1 A probabilistic relational algebra In <ref> [FR96b] </ref>, we present a probabilistic relational algebra (PRA) generalizing standard relational algebra, suitable as the basis of an integrated IR-DB system. Below, we briefly describe PRA. <p> Now we show how vague predicates can be handled in PRA. We only give an intuitive explanation here; a more formal treatment can be found in <ref> [FR96b] </ref>. As a simple example, assume that a person searching for relevant articles published after 1993 may also be interested in a highly relevant paper published one or two years before.

Reference-contexts: But IR systems consider the intrinsic vagueness of query formulations|a user may be uncertain about the spelling of an author's name, or when he requests documents from this year a paper from last December may also be relevant. For this problem, the concept of vague predicates was proposed in <ref> [Fuhr90] </ref>. Here a query condition consists of an attribute name, a predicate, and a comparison value (e.g., AUTHOR `Meier').

Reference-contexts: For 5 a specific attribute value (e.g., `Maier') the vague predicate yields an estimate of the probability that the condition is fulfilled from the user's point of view|instead of a Boolean value as in DB systems. In <ref> [Fuhr92a] </ref>, we showed how vague predicates can be integrated into a (probabilistic) IR system.

Reference-contexts: For example, a letter may belong to the conceptual document type "offer", consisting of frame (with sender and recipient) and body, where the latter is a set of product infos with name, description, and price. In <ref> [Fuhr92b] </ref>, this approach is extended from documents to all kinds of database objects. It is claimed that for databases comprising a large number of different object types, there is a need to support all three types of structures. Typically, the DB field deals only with the logical structure of objects.

Reference-contexts: Below, we present two approaches addressing these issues. 4.2 Probabilistic Datalog New IR applications require inferential capabilities that are not available with relational algebra. In <ref> [Fuhr95a] </ref>, we show that hierarchical document structures, hypertext documents, or retrieval employing terminological structures such as thesauri raise the need for recursive query languages. Given PRA, Datalog is a suitable candidate for such a query language. In [Fuhr95b], a probabilistic version of Datalog is presented.

Reference-contexts: In [Fuhr95a], we show that hierarchical document structures, hypertext documents, or retrieval employing terminological structures such as thesauri raise the need for recursive query languages. Given PRA, Datalog is a suitable candidate for such a query language. In <ref> [Fuhr95b] </ref>, a probabilistic version of Datalog is presented. We only want to mention the major ideas of this approach here. Probabilistic Datalog is an extension of stratified Datalog (e.g., [Ull88]).

Reference-contexts: This index supports efficient processing of typical IR queries. However, IR systems only allow for queries that can be processed this way. Thus, there is no physical data independence in these systems! In <ref> [Fuhr96] </ref>, we describe some problems where this approach falls short even in typical text retrieval systems: search for full word forms vs. stemming, noun phrase search, and treatment of compound words. <p> The query formulation should also be independent of the presence of an index|in contrast to some commercial IR systems that provide scanning capabilities, but not in a form that yields physical data independence. In <ref> [Fuhr96] </ref>, we describe an approach to implementing data independence in IR systems. As an underlying concept, we present data types with vague predicates. In the usual IR systems, the concept of data type does not show up explicitly, mainly because there is only one data type: text. <p> Our further work will use the pNF2 model as a starting point for the development of an OO data model with uncertainty. As a major extension to other OO models, we also consider inheritance on attributes (see <ref> [Fuhr96] </ref>), which is essential for performing networked IR. A related topic is the development of an OO retrieval logic. In traditional IR approaches, the unit to be retrieved is always fixed|namely documents as a whole.

Reference-contexts: As a basic model, we have developed PRA. Probabilistic Datalog yields a more expressive query language, whereas the pNF2 model is more appropriate for modelling document structures. Clearly, using object-oriented (OO) models for integrated IR-DB systems is the next step. The approach described in <ref> [HW92] </ref> focuses on the behavioral aspects of IR objects, but does not address the issue of uncertain inference. OO modelling of multimedia objects is used by many authors from the DB field, but the uncertainty issue is hardly ever mentioned.

Reference-contexts: There are powerful data models for representing a broad range of possible object structures, for retrieving and manipulating these structures. Recently, there has also been increasing interest in data models supporting the complex logical structure of text documents (e.g., <ref> [Loef94] </ref>). However, the more complex the logical structures, the greater the need for considering the content structure. For example, assume that we have an object-oriented DBMS as part of a CASE tool. In a bank application, the software manager might search for all modules affected by a new tax law.

In electronic publishing, one distinguishes between the logical and the layout structure of documents. For example, for document type "letter", there is a logical structure containing sender, recipient, salutation, several paragraphs, closing, and signature.

Reference-contexts: problems can be overcome only by duplicating attributes first (for which we use the colon symbol in the projection list), and a final projection on the relevant attributes (see Figure 9): BL30A = [BNO,PRICE]([PRICES &lt; 30]([PRICE0:PRICES] ([BNO,PRICE,PRICE:PRICE0](BOOK)))) In order to overcome these problems, nested NF2 algebras have been proposed (e.g., <ref> [SS86] </ref>). For this purpose, the pNF2 algebra supports path expressions as an additional parameter for all operators. In addition, we also allow for path expressions in selection formulas, which we call selection paths.
