Title: The Relative Importance of Concurrent Writers and Weak Consistency Models

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed comparison of the relative importance of allowing concurrent writers versus the choice of the underlying consistency model. Our comparison is based on single- and multiple-writer versions of a lazy release consistent (LRC) protocol, and a single-writer sequentially consistent protocol, all implemented in the CVM software distributed shared memory system. We find that in our environment, which we believe to be representative of distributed systems today and in the near future, the consistency model has a much higher impact on overall performance than the choice of whether to allow concurrent writers. The multiple writer protocol performs an average of 9% better than the single writer LRC protocol, but 34% better than the single-writer sequentially consistent protocol. Set against this, MW-LRC required an average of 72% memory overhead, compared to 10% overhead for the single-writer protocols.

Reference-contexts: All of our applications are free of data-races. The cost of creating a diff is substantial (approximately three fourths of the cost of an RPC in our system), and will probably grow relative to processor speed as memory latency falls further behind processor speed. 4 Systems such as Midway <ref> [1] </ref> avoid the page-length copies and comparison by using a modified compiler to annotate all shared writes with code that tracks accesses by using software dirty bits [17]. When the diff needs to be created, the software dirty bits are used to determine exactly which words have been modified.

Reference-contexts: DSM's larger coherence granularity causes it to suffer from increased coherence traffic because of false sharing, or simultaneous accesses by different processors to unrelated parts of the datum. Since relaxed consistency models can hide the effects of false sharing, software DSMs such as Tread-Marks [9], Munin <ref> [2] </ref>, and CarlOS [12], therefore, support multiple-writer protocols. These protocols allow multiple nodes to simultaneously modify different sections of the same page. The modifications are later reconciled by creating summaries of each of the modifications, called diffs [2], and applying the diffs to all copies of the page. 1 The advantages <p> hide the effects of false sharing, software DSMs such as Tread-Marks [9], Munin <ref> [2] </ref>, and CarlOS [12], therefore, support multiple-writer protocols. These protocols allow multiple nodes to simultaneously modify different sections of the same page. The modifications are later reconciled by creating summaries of each of the modifications, called diffs [2], and applying the diffs to all copies of the page. 1 The advantages of multiple-writer protocols for software DSMs are clear: the effects of false sharing are minimized and processors can locally decide to write any valid page without communicating with other processors. <p> Note that this is the case for any single-writer protocol, including the sequentially consistent protocol implemented in IVY [13] and the eager release consistent protocol implemented in Munin <ref> [2] </ref>. The obvious disadvantage of multiple-writer protocols is that they must use diffs to merge concurrent updates to the same page.

Reference-contexts: When the diff needs to be created, the software dirty bits are used to determine exactly which words have been modified. While the copy and comparison are avoided, the software dirty bit approach requires language support and adds overhead to every shared write. Recent work <ref> [3] </ref> shows that diffing outperforms software dirty bits in object-based systems, but the tradeoff is less clear for page-based systems. 2.3.4 Tradeoffs The most obvious advantage of the multiple-writer protocol is that it allows concurrent modifications of the same page without network communication.

Reference-contexts: Our comparison of the protocols shows that the performance of SW-LRC trails MW-LRC's by nine percent overall, but SW-LRC actually averages three percent better than MW-LRC for six of the eight applications This result has several causes. First, write-write false sharing is more rare than read-write <ref> [4] </ref> sharing. Second, the weak memory model hides most of the effects of read-write false sharing. Finally, communication in this environment has a high startup cost for each message, while the per-byte cost is relatively low.

Reference-contexts: Ownership could be retained by the current owner while servicing read faults, but the status of the owner's page still needs to be downgraded to read-only. We chose to migrate ownership as an optimization favoring migratory data. Like Mirage <ref> [5] </ref>, we address the ping-pong problem by guaranteeing a processor a minimum quantum of time with any newly retrieved page before it can be invalidated by another processor. The ping-pong problem occurs when multiple processors simultaneously attempt to write the same page.

Simplifying matters somewhat, shared memory accesses are labeled either as ordinary or as synchronization accesses, with the latter category further divided into acquire and release accesses.

Reference-contexts: Since MW-LRC does not currently implement garbage collection, we summarize the mechanism implemented in TreadMarks <ref> [7] </ref>. Garbage collection is initiated whenever any process notices that diff or write notice buffers are becoming exhausted. The initiating processor adds a garbage collection request to its next barrier arrival message, and the master re-distributes this request to all processors with the barrier release.

Reference-contexts: For the comparison described in this paper, we implemented three protocols: a multiple-writer LRC protocol (MW-LRC), a single-writer LRC protocol (SW-LRC), and a single-writer SC protocol (SW-SC). SW-LRC and MW-LRC are single- and multiple-writer protocols that implement the lazy release consistent (LRC) <ref> [8] </ref> memory model. We compare the performance of the two protocols in order to gauge the importance of allowing multiple simultaneous writers. LRC was chosen as the consistency model because it allows false sharing to be hidden more effectively than other memory models. <p> Finally, in Section 4, we present our conclusions. 2 2 CVM and Protocols This section provides a brief overview of lazy release consistency, a description of the CVM system in which the protocols are implemented, and a description of the protocols themselves. 2.1 Lazy Release Consistency Lazy Release Consistency <ref> [8] </ref> is a variant of eager release consistency (ERC) [6], a relaxed memory consistency that allows the effects of shared memory accesses to be delayed until selected synchronization accesses occur.

Since relaxed consistency models can hide the effects of false sharing, software DSMs such as Tread-Marks <ref> [9] </ref>, Munin [2], and CarlOS [12], therefore, support multiple-writer protocols. These protocols allow multiple nodes to simultaneously modify different sections of the same page. <p> Like commercially available systems such as TreadMarks <ref> [9] </ref>, CVM is written entirely as a user-level library and runs on most UNIX-like systems. Unlike TreadMarks, CVM was created specifically as a platform for protocol experimentation. The system is written in C++, and opaque interfaces are strictly enforced between different functional units of the system whenever possible. <p> The underlying system calls protocol hooks before and after page, synchronization, and I/O events take place. Since many of the methods are inlined, the resulting system is able to perform within a few percent of a severely optimized system, TreadMarks <ref> [9] </ref>, running a nearly identical protocol. However, CVM was designed to take advantage of generalized synchronization interfaces, as well as to use multi-threading for latency toleration. We therefore expect the performance of the fully functional system to improve over the 3 existing base.

Reference-contexts: Despite the two extra rounds of communication required to validate the pages, garbage collection in the TreadMarks system never reduced performance by more than 4%, and usually less than 1% <ref> [11] </ref>. Neither of the other protocols use either diffs or twins, but SW-LRC does use write notices.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, unless single-writer protocols are carefully crafted, producer-consumer interactions will require two network RPCs, each of which can consist of up to three messages. Note that this is the case for any single-writer protocol, including the sequentially consistent protocol implemented in IVY <ref> [13] </ref> and the eager release consistent protocol implemented in Munin [2]. The obvious disadvantage of multiple-writer protocols is that they must use diffs to merge concurrent updates to the same page. <p> Both IVY and Munin use a scheme based on following chains of probable owners until the real owner is located, collapsing the probable owner pointers as a request is forwarded. Li and Hudac <ref> [13] </ref> showed that in the worst case, k faults of a page in an n-processor system can result in a worst case of O (n + k log n) hops.

Reference-contexts: The SP-2 has a high-performance Omega switch in which each bi-directional link is capable of a sustained bandwidth of approximately forty megabytes per second. Each processor is a 66MHz RS/6000 Power2 processor. The applications were run on a version of CVM ported to MPI <ref> [14] </ref>. MPI does not yet allow handlers to be called asynchronously on receipt of messages, so the system polls for incoming messages when outgoing messages are sent.

Reference-contexts: TSP performs well despite fine-grained sharing because it synchronizes infrequently (see Table 2). 3.3.1 Sharing We used our run-time system to generate traces showing all page protection changes during executions. These traces, timestamped by the globally synchronous clock on the switch of the SP-2 <ref> [15] </ref>, drive a post-mortem analyzer that tracks how long individual pages are shared in various modes. Table 4 shows the results. Several items are of interest. First, two applications, Spatial and QS, have substantial write sharing under MW-LRC.

Reference-contexts: A "2-Hop Lock" takes three messages. Page fault terms are similar. The "segv handler" is the time consumed by AIX in calling a user-level handler for a page fault. 3.2 Applications The applications used in this study include four applications from the SPLASH-2 <ref> [16] </ref> suite of shared-memory programs: Water-Nsquared (Water), Water-spatial (Spatial), FMM, and LU. The other four programs were locally written: FFT, SOR, Quicksort (QS), and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Table 2 summarizes the inputs and characteristics for the applications.
