Abstract: A number of exact algorithms have been developed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks in recent years. These algorithms use graph-theoretic techniques to analyze and exploit network topology. In this paper, we examine the problem of efficient probabilistic inference in a belief network as a combinatorial optimization problem, that of finding an optimal factoring given an algebraic expression over a set of probability distributions. We define a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal factoring problem, and discuss application of this problem in belief networks. We show that optimal factoring provides insight into the key elements of efficient probabilistic inference, and present simple, easily implemented algorithms with excellent performance. We also show how use of an algebraic perspective permits significant extension to the belief net representation.

Reference-contexts: Not described here are algorithms which can exploit this structure to perform efficeint inference. For details see <ref> [1] </ref>. ( Noisy Or) The time and space complexity of Bayes net inference is typically exponential in the number of antecedents to a variable. However, a special interaction structure has been identified, known as the "noisy or," which is linear in the number of antecedents.

Reference-contexts: The most important conclusion from the experimental results is that OFP is a useful way of efficiently solving probabilistic inference problems in a belief network. We have also studied the opportunities for parallelism in belief network inference. Set-factoring has shown good factoring results for parallelizing probabilistic inference <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Local Expressions As we have seen, a belief net is a compact, localized representation of a probabilistic model. All is not as rosy at it might seem, though. The graphical level is not capable of representing all interesting structural information which might simplify representation or inference.

Reference-contexts: The noisy-or [7], for example, can be used to model independent causes of an event, and inference complexity is linear in both space and time in the number of antecedents for many inferences. Similarly, contingencies [9], as well as the value-dependent independence exploited in similarity nets <ref> [4] </ref> are inefficiently represented using a full conditional.

Reference-contexts: We can combine the above lemmas in a simple algorithm with provably optimal performance for singly connected networks. Further, the factoring portion of the algorithm runs in linear time. Due to space limitations we omit the algorithm, see <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> We have developed an efficient algorithm based on the latter heuristic <ref> [6] </ref>. The main idea behind this algorithm is, at each step, to find a pair of factors to combine which yield the smallest result. The set-factoring algorithm only considers information one step in advance for choosing each pair, so it can be implemented efficiently.
