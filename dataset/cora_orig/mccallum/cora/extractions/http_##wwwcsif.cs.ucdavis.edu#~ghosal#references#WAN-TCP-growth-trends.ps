Abstract: We analyze the growth of a large research laboratory's wide-area TCP connections over a period of three years. Our data consisted of eight month-long traces of all TCP connections made between the site and the rest of the world. We find that many TCP protocols exhibited exponential growth in the number of connections made and bytes transferred, even though the number of hosts at the site only grew linearly. While the exponential growth of some of the protocols began tapering off with the final datasets, relatively new information-retrieval protocols such as Gopher and WorldWide Web exhibited explosive growth during the same time. Our study also found that individual users greatly affected the site's traffic profile by the inadvertent or casual initiation of multiple, periodic wide-area connections; that exponential growth is fed in part by more users "discovering" the Internet and in part by existing users increasingly incorporating use of the Internet into their work patterns; and that wide-area traffic geography is diverse and dynamic.

Reference-contexts: X500 refers to the X.500 Directory Services protocol [WRH92]; the protocol exhibited very rapid growth, about 165%/year, but declined between LBL-7 and LBL-8, suggesting that its use may have peaked. The gopher document search and retrieval protocol <ref> [AML+93] </ref> showed even more dynamic growth: the final five datasets fit fairly well to growing by nearly a factor of 40 each year.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the number of different hosts making connections over the backbone is not available. The NSFnet T1 backbone traffic is further studied by Claffy et. al. <ref> [CPB93] </ref>, who found that the number of bytes traversing the T1 backbone grew quadratically between June, 1988, and June, 1992, though this growth trend is at least partially influenced by the traffic switch ing over to the T3 backbone later in the study period. * Statistics for USENET network news traffic <p> We only attempted to identify the most popular. In comparison, [Rutkowski93] reports 1,066 different identifiable services present on the NSFnet backbone during May, 1993. We also note that the rapid growth of such connections ( 90%/year) is in keeping with the finding in <ref> [CPB93] </ref> that the "other" protocol traffic on the NSFnet T1 backbone steadily increased. <p> We now look at the growth in connections generated by individual hosts. We first note that our datasets support the "busy-source" and "favorite-site" effects, first noted by [Kleinrock76] and later confirmed by <ref> [DJCME92, CPB93] </ref>, that only a handful of hosts dominate network traffic. For telnet, the 5 busiest local hosts generated between 25-40% of all connections; for ftp, about 40-50%; and for smtp, about 50-70%. We next turn to gauging whether individual users are increasingly using wide area connections.

While the Internet grew exponentially over this period, the rate lessened with time. Fitting an exponential to the entire body of data yields a growth rate of 140%/year.

Reference-contexts: The acquisition of the traces, which we summarize here, is discussed in greater detail in <ref> [Paxson93] </ref>. The University of California operates LBL, which is dedicated to basic research, under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy. <p> The "Drops" column gives the drop count reported by the Ethernet driver followed by the drop count reported by tcpdump; this last value represents dropped SYN/FIN/RST packets. As noted in <ref> [Paxson93] </ref>, the increasing number of dropped packets in the later datasets appears correlated with "RST storms"|periods during which two hosts furiously exchange RST packets. We reduced the traces by extracting only full TCP connections, i.e., two exchanged SYN packets followed by two exchanged FIN packets. <p> We also removed connections that transferred no data, and those that purported to transfer implausibly large amounts of data 6 , attributing the latter to protocol errors. Details of the removed connections are given in <ref> [Paxson93] </ref>; the number removed was almost always less than 1% of a protocol's connections. <p> The X-axis gives the year, and the Y-axis plots log 2 of the average number of connections made each day.

Addressing now each protocol in turn: * The number of smtp (electronic mail) connections grew at an approximately exponential rate. <p> This rate varied from a low of 15% (LBL-3) to a high of 45% (LBL-2). The final factor is the proportion of "failed" nntp connections. As explained in <ref> [Paxson93] </ref>, an nntp connection during which the originator transfers exactly 6 bytes corresponds to a "failure" in the sense that the responder stated it was unable to accept news at that time.

We find that shell connections vary enormously. <p> In comparison, the recent NSFnet growth rate has been 126%/year <ref> [Rutkowski93] </ref>. * X11 traffic showed impressive exponential growth between LBL-2 and LBL-5, increasing by more than a factor of 10 each year, much higher than the connection growth of a factor of 4 each year.
