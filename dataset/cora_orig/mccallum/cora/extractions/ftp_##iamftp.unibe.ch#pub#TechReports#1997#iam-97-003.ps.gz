Abstract: This report describes work on handwritten numeral string recognition. In particular, we address the building of a continuous recognition system based on hidden Markov models and the combination of this system with a previously developed discrete recognition system. We describe experiments with a simple combination scheme, called score summation, that turns out to be capable of improving the recognition rates of both individual systems.

Reference-contexts: To study combination schemes, it is necessary to have at least two independent systems. Currently, handwritten numeral string recognition systems are either based on the discrete or the continuous approach. Since we had already implemented one system based on the discrete approach <ref> [15] </ref>, we investigated and implemented another one based on the continuous approach, and then studied appropriate schemes to combine the two systems. Ha & Bunke Numeral String Recognition 4 Section 2 summarises the discrete recognition system that had been implemented in our previous works. <p> Section 4 discusses the combination of the two systems, including experimental results and Section 5 concludes the report. 2 Discrete Recognition System (DRS) This section provides a brief description of our discrete recognition system. The full description can be found in <ref> [15, 17] </ref>. In the discrete approach, the numeral isolation (separation) takes place at a number of points where the image exhibits some special characteristics. <p> We also introduced the concept of dummy symbol in order to overcome the problem of noisy parts that cannot be eliminated Ha & Bunke Numeral String Recognition 5 by standard filtering algorithms. Experiments on totally unconstrained data showed that the results compare favorably to other published methods <ref> [15, 17] </ref>. More details will be provided in Section 4. 3 Continuous Recognition System (CRS) In the continuous approach, a sliding window scans the input image from left to right. Each position of the window defines a sub-image which is extracted and analysed.

Reference-contexts: Another method consists in using a recurrent neural network (a general architecture that includes time-delay neural networks) to encode information between neighbouring vertical strips (thin vertical sliding windows) [20].

Reference-contexts: For instance, the analysis of the vertical projection of black pixels provides a simple (but not always correct or sufficient) way to segment the input string into numerals or groups of numerals. Other special characteristics are line end-points, crossings, and T-joints <ref> [24] </ref>. Our DRS is able to simultaneously segment and recognise totally unconstrained data. The system is built upon a number of components, namely, a presegmen-tation module, an isolated numeral recogniser, a segmentation-free module and a merging module; see Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the precision of the combined system is nearly as high as the second system while increasing the speed to something between the two systems. The serial scheme is of great importance to practical applications and is already routinely used <ref> [25] </ref>. In our work, we are interested in the parallel scheme, which has the potential to improve the precision over those of the individual systems, at the price of a higher computation time.

Reference-contexts: Our continuous recognition system is built on the software package HTK provided by Entropic Cambridge Research Laboratory <ref> [29] </ref>. We first describe the HMM framework, then explain the feature extraction. 3.1 HMM Framework The idea of HMM is the decomposition of a complex stochastic process into two simpler but nevertheless coupled processes. <p> The solution to this problem is provided by a dynamic programming technique, called Viterbi algorithm, together with a backtracking mechanism; see <ref> [29] </ref> for more details. In sum, applying HMM to numeral string recognition consists of the following steps: 1. Select a feature extraction method. 2. Choose the HMM design parameters for each numeral. 3. Train the remaining HMMs parameters. 4. Test the models. <p> Therefore, its description is given in the Section 3.2. The second step is mostly heuristic, i.e., based on trial and error. The last two steps correspond to standard functionalities of the HTK package for which full details can be found in <ref> [29] </ref>. 3.2 Feature Extraction Although HMM can be applied directly to the raw pixels within a thin vertical sliding window, our past experience in the field of isolated numeral recognition suggests that more sophisticated features can significantly enhance the discrimination power of the system.
