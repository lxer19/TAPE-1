Author: Mark Hayter and Derek McAuley 
Note: To appear in ACM Operating Systems Review

Affiliation: University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory  
Abstract: A novel architecture for use within an end computing system is described. This attempts to extend the concepts used in modern high speed networks into computer system design. A multimedia workstation is being built based on this concept to evaluate the approach.

Reference-contexts: A separate loopback path also exists between the output and input. The port controllers run a microkernel called Wanda, a locally developed multiprocessor operating system. This supports the ANSA Testbench 4 <ref> [1] </ref> over the Multi-Service Network Architecture (MSNA) [7]. ANSA provides a distributed computing environment, while MSNA is a network architecture designed to support multimedia by providing ATM internetworking.

Reference-contexts: We propose an architecture for the internal interconnection of a computer system, which combines various aspects of ATM LANs and traditional interconnection networks. An ATM switch is used to provide interconnections between the components 1 We use ATM in the general sense defined in CCITT I.113 <ref> [2] </ref>, `A transfer mode in which information is organized in to cells; : : : ', rather then to refer to specific properties of the ATM Layer in B-ISDN 1 of the machine and from these components directly to a high speed ATM network.

Reference-contexts: A similar divergence of uses can be seen with FDDI and the Cambridge Backbone Ring <ref> [3] </ref> (MANs used as LANs) and SMDS (DQDB MAN used as access link to WAN).

Reference-contexts: For example although the Cambridge Fast Ring (CFR) was designed as a LAN, it has been used as an ATM switch in the Unison project [11], a LAN in the Pandora project <ref> [4] </ref> and an Ethernet bridging MAN in the Metrobridge [8]. A similar divergence of uses can be seen with FDDI and the Cambridge Backbone Ring [3] (MANs used as LANs) and SMDS (DQDB MAN used as access link to WAN). <p> However, with a comparable speed LAN, dedicated file servers may be a better approach. 2 An initial experimental system may use separate displays, but the Pandora <ref> [4] </ref> project has shown the benefits of an integrated approach 7 In the workstation there will be two main types of communication. One due to the real time streams, and the other control information. Both are implemented on top of the ATM substrate.

The switch fabric will be of either 4 or 8 ports. In its use as a LAN there is a combined input and output port controller for each switch fabric port.

Reference-contexts: This is discussed below (section 3.1). Of interest for a DAN based multiprocessor, are some of the techniques developed for distributed virtual memory <ref> [6] </ref>. In these systems, a collection of machines on a LAN are used as a pseudo-multiprocessor by arranging that some memory is shared between all the processors.

Reference-contexts: * Display In the case of a multimedia workstation the display will need to support a windowing system as well as real time streams 2 . * Synchronisation Streams coming over the network will suffer from skew and jitter, and will need resynchronising (the lip-sync problem being a classic example). <ref> [9] </ref> has proposed that a synchronisation service for multimedia needs to be placed in the end system, or on a network node with a low jitter path to the end system.

Reference-contexts: The processors compete for DAN bandwidth into the LAN interface node, where the ATM cells are forwarded onto the LAN connection. Incoming cells are similarly demultiplexed to the appropriate processor or memory unit. The Axon project proposes a similar system for a host interface to a high speed LAN <ref> [10] </ref>. The main difference is that in the Axon design the network interface will plug into an existing interconnection network.

Reference-contexts: However, in categorising a network, often it is the protocols and management techniques that differ rather than the underlying networks themselves. For example although the Cambridge Fast Ring (CFR) was designed as a LAN, it has been used as an ATM switch in the Unison project <ref> [11] </ref>, a LAN in the Pandora project [4] and an Ethernet bridging MAN in the Metrobridge [8]. A similar divergence of uses can be seen with FDDI and the Cambridge Backbone Ring [3] (MANs used as LANs) and SMDS (DQDB MAN used as access link to WAN).

Reference-contexts: The main difference is that in the Axon design the network interface will plug into an existing interconnection network. Thus the point at which the ATM multiplex is lost is the network interface rather than the communication end points. 4 Similarly, the DataMesh project at HPlabs <ref> [12] </ref> proposes using a high speed inter-connect to link a collection of storage nodes within a single storage server on a LAN.
