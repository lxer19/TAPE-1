Abstract: Several authors have proposed specifying semantics for representational systems by translating them into logic. Unfortunately, such translations often introduce unnecessary detail and complexity. We indicate how many kinds of informal semantics can be transformed directly into formal semantics of no greater complexity. The key to avoiding the difficulties of logical translations is to recognize the difference between internal and external meanings. This paper will appear in IEEE Computer.
