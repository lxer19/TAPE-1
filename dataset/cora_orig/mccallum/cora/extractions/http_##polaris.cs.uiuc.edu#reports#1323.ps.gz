Reference-contexts: Step sizes of femptoseconds (10 15 seconds) are common. Simulation of the solvation process for even a single picosecond can require thousands of time steps. For this reason, interesting molecular dynamics simulations incur considerable computational expense. 2 2 Overview of the sequential code The computer simulation package McMOLDYN <ref> [1] </ref> models a water system with a cubic box filled with water molecules. Calculations are simplified by using a periodic boundary. Swamy and Clementi [2] modified the McMOLDYN package to consider a turn of B-DNA in solution with the 1,500 water molecules and twenty potassium counterions.

Swamy and Clementi <ref> [2] </ref> modified the McMOLDYN package to consider a turn of B-DNA in solution with the 1,500 water molecules and twenty potassium counterions. The time of the simulation is 4 picoseconds (10 12 seconds), with a step size of 0:5 femptoseconds (10 15 seconds.), for a total of 8,000 time steps.

Reference-contexts: The added point charge is an approximate model for the polarizability of the water molecule. The simulation employs the potential function of Matsuoka, Clementi and Yoshi-mine (the MCY potential) <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Temperature is obtained from the translational and rotational kinetic energies from a relation using the Boltzmann constant, k, 3N kT = E tr + E rot : (2:11) Solution to the equations of motion come from application of the Gear predictor-corrector approach <ref> [4] </ref> based on the Taylor expansion. The sixth-order accuracy of this method is needed to follow the behavior, which can change dramatically even with extremely short time steps.

Reference-contexts: difference of the predicted second derivative from the actual is used to correct the others, r corr k = r pred k f 2 r c = t 2 ! F pred m H 2 O r pred 2 : (2.15) The corrector constant f 2 k is tabulated in <ref> [5] </ref>. The simulation performs only one correction for each time step. 2.1 Baseline Performance Using a 28 processor cluster of an Alliant FX/2800, performance tests executing the serial program for five time steps produced the profile shown in Table 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Parallel speedup is the ratio of the execution time on one processor to the time using N processors, Speedup = T 1 : (3:2) A predicted value for speedup comes from an application of Amdahl's Law <ref> [6] </ref>, Speedup = 1 : (3:3) Ratios may be substituted for time in equation (3.3). Performance results for the optimized code appear in Figure 3.5. Note especially the difference between the measured data and the ideal and theoretical curves.

Reference-contexts: On the Alliant FX/2800 the best execution time for the sequential code is compared with timings obtained for the optimized code. For reference, the same results appear for an implementation on a Cray Y-MP system. Performance data for the Cray along with many other high-performance computers appears in <ref> [7] </ref>. Neither the performance nor the performance improvement on the Alliant FX/2800 matches that of the Cray. This may be attributed to the faster clock and the efficient implementation of vectorization on the Cray processors.

Reference-contexts: Simulations that use algorithms of complexity O (N 2 ) result. A recent advance in the solution of the N -body problem may prove promising for molecular dynamics simulations. A new approach to the solution of the N -body problem appears in a thesis by Leslie Greengard <ref> [8] </ref>. The fast multipole method can determine the forces due to interacting bodies in time proportional to N , using a refined-grid approach. Application of this algorithm to the problem of interacting molecules should result in simulations faster by an order of magnitude.
