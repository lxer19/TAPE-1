Title: The Convergence of Query and Object-Oriented Languages  
Author: Zachary Ives Craig Wilcox 
Date: December 10, 1998  
Abstract: The area of custom database applications is a large and rapidly growing domain, as evidenced by the appearance of tools for developing web front-ends to databases (e.g. Microsoft Visual InterDev), the large number of commercial programming environments now providing "database wizards" (e.g. Symantec Visual Cafe, Microsoft Visual C++) and the emergence of database interconnectivity standards (e.g. JDBC, ODBC). Most sophisticated database applications are a combination of code in a full object-oriented host language such as C++ or Java and a series of queries written in a declarative language such as SQL or OQL. The combination of object-oriented and declarative languages, as well as of different underlying data representations, creates an impedance mismatch the two languages have different data and execution models. This paper explores the compromises made by different methods of reconciling those models. We contrast embedded SQL languages (C++ with embedded SQL, SQLJ), which offer static pre-compiled query capabilities, with dynamic implementations (ODBC, JDBC), which support ad-hoc queries. We also examine the effects of different data models (relational, object-relational, and object-oriented) on the impedance mismatch problem, as well as their effects on optimizing declarative queries. We conclude with an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and offer suggestions about where the database field may be moving.

Reference-contexts: However, there is no way for the user to define an operator that applies only to a given domain <ref> [Dat95] </ref>. SQL includes commands for querying and updating databases, as well as for creating and managing tables. However, the most commonly used queries are of the form "SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...".

Reference-contexts: Codd in the late 1960s <ref> [KS91] </ref>. The relational model is based on tables, generally referred to as relations, with a fixed set of columns, or attributes. An individual record, or tuple, comprises one row in the table; the tuple has either data or a null value for each attribute.

Reference-contexts: ODL defines the basic data layout, and has many similarities to a CORBA Interface Def 7 inition Language specification or a C++ header file. It contains a series of interface (class) definitions, which consist of attributes, operations (methods), and relationships <ref> [Lev98] </ref>. Attributes, naturally, have a type (primitive, container, or user-defined object) and a name. Operations are simply declarations of functions which are implemented in a separate language such as Java.

Reference-contexts: In an object-oriented database (OODB), objects can hold references (much like references in a conventional programming language) to other objects using their OIDs <ref> [Ram98, p. 634] </ref>. 4 Somewhat surprisingly, object-oriented databases have not established themselves as a major segment of the database market. This is primarily because they are so dramatically different from relational databases that few optimization techniques and algorithms apply. <p> The SQL3 data definition language is much more reminiscent of the SQL DDL, lacking the 8 clean structure of ODL. In particular, SQL3's DDL supports "CREATE TABLE", "CREATE ABSTRACT DATA TYPE", and "CREATE FUNCTION" primitives <ref> [Ram98, pp. 618-622] </ref>. ODL defines classes in a block-structured fashion, like C++; SQL3 DDL defines them in a less structured fashion, like ML or Cecil, where function declarations may be scattered throughout the code. <p> If such a plan includes arbitrary functions, it may be impossible to give a useful estimate. Most existing systems simply require that the user supply a fixed cost estimate for each function (or a means of computing that cost, if it is variable) <ref> [Ram98, p. 641] </ref>. This is, of course, extremely difficult, and poor estimates will result in suboptimal performance. Another compromise comes in the area of auxiliary data structures designed to increase execution efficiency. <p> Although an object-relational database still has difficulty estimating costs for user-defined functions, the database is still structured such that many optimization issues can be resolved using relational techniques. Indexing of tuples, for instance, is still possible, although the indexing schemes must be more extensible <ref> [Ram98, p. 638] </ref>. Another very important factor contributing to interest in the object- relational data model is that, since it is not as seamless as the OO model, object-relational database applications tend to be implemented in two separate pieces. <p> Basic techniques such as indexing may no longer be applicable. Query optimization with user-defined functions is challenging, although some have proposed that in some cases test runs of the functions on different data sets might be useful in forming cost estimates <ref> [Ram98, p. 641] </ref>. The trend both in research and in the industry is a general movement to the object-relational data model. This model includes most of the benefits of the relational model, plus it adds the flexibility of user-defined objects.

Reference-contexts: histograms, which are extremely valuable to the relational data model, will provide useful. 12 Yet another problem with most existing object-oriented database implementations is that the application and database code are integrated, and thus tend to run on the client side, rather than the server side, in a client-server application <ref> [Tiw98] </ref>. This potentially results in much greater traffic, as large quantities of data may have be "shipped" across the network in order to perform a query.
