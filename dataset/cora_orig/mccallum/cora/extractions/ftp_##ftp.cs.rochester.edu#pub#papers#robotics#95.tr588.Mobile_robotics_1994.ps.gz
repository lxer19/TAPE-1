Abstract: On 7 December 1994, four student-built autonomous robots demonstrated various strategic, tactical, and mechanical approaches to a delivery task. That event was preceded by approximately two years of history and two days of frenzied preparation. Our robotics efforts were based on materials from MIT's well-known 6.270 course. This report summarizes our experiences, from pedagogical goals and organizational matters through mechanical and electronic techniques. Our intended audience is future robot-builders, and organizers of robot-building courses. We assume familiarity with material in Jones and Flynn's Mobile Robotics text, and with the various materials available from MIT over the internet.

Reference-contexts: The space of motor codes was searched via stochastic hill-climbing, and the resultant motor codes were scored on their fitness through a reinforcement learning type algorithm. We refer the interested reader to <ref> [1] </ref> for more details. In addition, we have also been working on methods for perception-based navigation using self-organizing sensory-motor networks [4]. The Cyclops robot has a complex control structure that is reported in the Spring AAAI Symposium on Instantiated Agents. <p> This gave a (very) low-resolution view of the area in front of the robot. The robot used these inputs and a form of reinforcement learning to learn how to avoid obstacles <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The first issue is board kits. A.1 Rug Warrior: Jones and Flynn Book One choice: Rug Warrior kits from AK Peters (publisher of <ref> [2] </ref>). Rug Warrior is a robot board designed to support the examples in [2]. The kit supplies all the control and sensor circuitry needed to construct a custom designed, fully autonomous mobile robot. <p> The first issue is board kits.

The microprocessor, memory, and interface circuits are assembled and tested at the factory so that kits arrive ready to connect to the user's computer.

Reference-contexts: The way in which we ensure that a timely scheduling of the lower level task processes is done is by statically describing the "lazy" or "eager" type of process to be created. This is similar in function to the types of sensed feature refreshing in <ref> [3] </ref>. One might be able to postulate a distinction between layers that is based on scale of action, that is, the resolution of the goal. In the case of line following or bump behaviors, the robot response (or goal) is rather subtle.

The Cyclops robot has a complex control structure that is reported in the Spring AAAI Symposium on Instantiated Agents. The Meccano Monster was re-programmed and re-instrumented to do obstacle recognition with a triad of photo-resistors, each looking down a tube. <p> The robot used these inputs and a form of reinforcement learning to learn how to avoid obstacles [1]. Later, a simulator for the robot world was built and a simulated version of the robot learned to find its way home from any position on the arena <ref> [4] </ref>. 32 A Parts Lists and Information The following is to set up the lab with two workstations and to get four kits, one for assembly over summer by the course organizers, three for Fall 1994 Grad course. The first issue is board kits.
