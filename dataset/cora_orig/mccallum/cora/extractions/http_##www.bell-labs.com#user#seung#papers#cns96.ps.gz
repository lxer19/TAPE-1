Abstract: The neural integrator of the oculomotor system is modeled as a network of spiking, conductance-based model neurons. The static function of the integrator, holding the eyes still when the head is fixed in space, is the focus of the modeling. The synaptic weight matrix, which is of outer product form, is tuned by minimizing the mean squared drift velocity of the eyes over a range of eye positions, leading to an approximate line attractor dynamics. The conductance-based model is reduced to a rate-based one to simplify the tuning procedure.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In the time intervals between saccades, the eyes are held still by a neural network integrator located in the hindbrain <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. With the head fixed in space, constant neural activity in the integrator is necessary for gaze stabilization. The pattern of activity is different for each eye position, even though the visual and vestibular inputs to the integrator remain the same.

Thus Eq. (3) describes an attractive line of fixed points, otherwise known as a line attractor <ref> [2] </ref>. Fig. 2 illustrates what happens to the line attractor when g (u) is nonlinear. The upper part of the figure shows the optimal approximation G (m) m achievable with four nonlinear neurons.

Reference-contexts: The firing rates of six of the neurons are shown being driven by pulses of input from saccadic command neurons at the times indicated by the arrows. Conductance-based model Previous models of the integrator have relied on positive feedback in networks of completely linear neurons <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. In contrast, the present work uses conductance-based model neurons as described by Hansel and Sompolinsky [7]. Their nonlinear current-discharge relationships qualitatively match intracellular measurements of real integrator neurons [8, 9]. <p> The minimization is done with respect to the i parameters only. If g (u) were linear, then i could be tuned so that G (m) = m in Eqs. (4) and (7) exactly. Such linearity has been the basis of previous network models of the integrator <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. This implies that the drift velocity dm=dt is zero at all positions m and that every point on the line is a fixed point of the dynamics. Thus Eq. (3) describes an attractive line of fixed points, otherwise known as a line attractor [2].

Reference-contexts: Both types of error lead to a drift velocity that depends on eye position. In our current research, we are trying to understand these two sources of error and their relative contribution in real networks. Measurements of eye position in the dark generally reveal a position-dependent drift velocity <ref> [10] </ref>, which can be compared with model results like those shown in Fig. 2 (b). Our model is able to relate the physiological properties of neurons and synapses in the integrator with a behavioral quantity, the drift velocity of the eyes.
