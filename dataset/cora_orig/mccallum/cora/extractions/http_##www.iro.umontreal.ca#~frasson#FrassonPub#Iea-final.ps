Abstract: In this paper, we present a knowledge-based system intended to support automatic course generation for a particular target group. This generation is realized by a reasoning process on the curriculum and is guided by the set of knowledge which should be acquired by the learner. The idea is to produce a modifiable course graph that would allow to control the evolution of a learners cognitive structure. The course produced is directly exploitable by an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) or by a human professor.

Reference-contexts: It is part of a complete authoring and ITS system that makes use of the course produced for learning purposes. It has been used for the construction of several courses in the SAFARI project <ref> [FG94] </ref>. In particular, a course for beginners nurses on the handling of an intravenous infusion pump, a course for first year medicine students on the clinic exam in the intensive care unit and also a course on the Quebec highway code.

Reference-contexts: brief presentation of the subject-matter model, we present the problematic of course generation, the generation process we developed and how CREAM sustains it. 2.CREAM: A SUBJECT MATTER REPRE SENTATION MODEL FOR ITS We consider the curriculum in ITS as a structured representation of the subject matter in terms of capabilities <ref> [GBW92] </ref>, instructional objectives and pedagogical resources (learning materials). Achievement of instructional objectives contributes to the acquisition of capabilities. This achievement is supported by pedagogical resources through learning activities (exercises, demonstrations, problems, simulations...).

Reference-contexts: Thus, a system that permits to rapidly build a course according to some needs could contribute to decrease these costs. Researches have been made to ease this process. Systems such as ISD Expert [Mer87], ISD Expert [Ten93], the GAIDA project <ref> [Gag93] </ref> have been specified to that effect. These systems offer a set of tools that are used in the instructional design process. However, the course building process still remains an explicit task of the instructional designer.

Reference-contexts: This entry level is specified by using a qualifying value taken from an evaluation (or acquisition) vocabulary. For example, in Klausmeiers vocabulary <ref> [Kla90] </ref>, a capability of type concept can be recognized, identified, classified or generalized (4 acquisition levels) whereas a capability rule can be applied or transferred (only 2). Evaluation vocabularies are denoted in our system by an ordered set of integers representing different levels of acquisition.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Industrial training is time consuming and expensive. For instance, IBM US spends $2 billion a year on training including $1 billion for trainers salaries; Each year, the US government spends $20 billion on military training <ref> [MW93] </ref>. Part of this training cost is relied to the instructional design and to the teaching process. Thus, a system that permits to rapidly build a course according to some needs could contribute to decrease these costs. Researches have been made to ease this process.

Reference-contexts: These links can be defined by the instructional designer or generated by the curricular system by reasoning on its knowledge structures <ref> [NG96] </ref>. 2.3. LEARNING RESOURCE MODELLING Pedagogical resources are the means used by the teaching system to support the teaching/learning process.

Reference-contexts: INSTRUCTIONAL-OBJECTIVE MODEL An instructional objective is the description of the behavior (or performance) that the student must demonstrate following a learning process. Several studies have shown the necessity of objective specification in teaching systems ([Les88]; <ref> [Web94] </ref>). We have taken this into account in our representation approach by introducing an instructional objectives model (CREAM-O) in which instructional objectives are represented and organized together by links of type prerequisite, complementary or pretext. <p> In general, a specific objective is composed of several terminal objectives. This set of objectives is centered on a well-defined educational purpose and can tackle various themes around it. If we group some parts that became apparent after our study of the different representations of the course concept ([Koe94], <ref> [Web94] </ref>), we state that a course is composed of three main parts: descriptive part: its title, its description and the set of general objectives.
