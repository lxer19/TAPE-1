Abstract: Fanout routing for Ball Grid Array(BGA) packages becomes non-trivial when the I/O pin count increases. With large number of I/Os, the number of I/Os we can put on a package is not always limited by the available area but sometimes by the ability to fan them out on the next level of interconnect|the PCB or MCM substrate. This paper is the first to consider this problem and offers an efficient algorithm (EVENFANOUT) to solve it. EVENFANOUT generates the optimal uniform distribution of wires. Another important contribution is that we analyzed the relationship between pin pitch and the routability of fanout so that the package designer can choose an optimal pitch for maximum routability. Knowing this relationship, we know whether a fanout routing is routable or not before it is routed. This is implemented in the Package Early Analysis and Routing Tool (PEART) for rapid development of Ball Grid Array Packages.

Reference-contexts: Hence we know a package is routable (or not) before it is routed. This is implemented in the Package Early Analysis and Routing Tool (PEART) for designing BGAs. Darnauer and Dai <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a similar algorithm, although under a different context. They have shown that their algorithm generates a routing whose critical density is no more than p times the density of the perimeter cuts. Since our algorithm creates the same topological routing, it also has this property.

Reference-contexts: The EVENFANOUT Algorithm This definition is similar to the MTR definition for PGA routing <ref> [2] </ref>. Intuitively, MTR specifies a class of topological routing where all wires originate from the pads enter the pin array without any detours. Once a wire enters a ring, it never leaves. Figure 2 shows a simple example of an MTR and a non-monotonic topological routing. <p> Once a wire enters a ring, it never leaves. Figure 2 shows a simple example of an MTR and a non-monotonic topological routing. Note that the assignment order on ring 2 is violated in the non-monotonic routing. Yu and Dai <ref> [2] </ref> showed that an MTR has a unique pin assignment known as the monotonic pin assignment (MPA) where MPA is formally defined as follows: Definition 2: A monotonic pin assignment (MPA) is a pin assignment such that for all r, ( r i ) &gt; j ) if and only if

Reference-contexts: After the assignment, we can generate the topological routing using the simple algorithm MAKEMTR (Figure 5). The routing from r i to ( r i ) is created by the shortest-path algorithm described by Dai, Dayan and Staepelaere <ref> [3] </ref>. After the topological routing is created, design rules can be enforced as proposed by Dai, Kong and Sato [4] which is based on Maley's [5] routability test using the rubber-band sketch model. The rubber-band representation of topological routing of Surf is described by Dai, Kong, Jue and Sato [6].

Surf also provides the user interface. The time required to do the assignment is negligible compared to generating the rubber band topological routing. Surf serves as the routing tool to route packages designed by PEART, the Package Early-Analysis and Routing Tool.

In general we need to check O (G 2 ) cuts under the Euclidean wiring metric where G is the number of obstacles.
