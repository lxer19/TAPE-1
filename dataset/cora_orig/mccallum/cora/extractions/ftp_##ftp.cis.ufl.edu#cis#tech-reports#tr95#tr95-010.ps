Reference-contexts: This spectral function is then used to modulate the frequency characteristics of the chosen wavelet basis leading to the construction of the preconditioner. A third early vision problem that we consider in this paper is the computation of optical flow from an image sequence. Recently, Barron et al., <ref> [1] </ref> have presented a comprehensive survey of various optical flow computation techniques along with a quantitative comparison of them. We note that the survey did not do any comparison of the computation time required by the various algorithms. <p> We get drastically better and more robust estimates of optical flow than any gradient based optical flow technique reported in Barron et al., <ref> [1] </ref>. Using wavelet basis, we develop a preconditioner 8 for this problem which assists our algorithm in converging very fast. <p> Compared to the results for the other gradient based methods reported in Barron et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, our new formulation gives the best solution with 100% flow density. In fact, our adaptive preconditioner can also be used with the other gradient based regularization formulations of the optical flow problem.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Pentland [19] presented a technique for surface interpolation using a change of basis to orthonormal wavelets as a preconditioning transform. He uses the results of Beylkin et al., <ref> [2] </ref> which states that the application of (N fi N ) matrices corresponding to any pseudo-differential and Calderon-Zygmund operators to arbitrary vectors requires either O (N ) or O (N log N ) operations based on whether nonstandard or standard wavelet transform is used. <p> Thirdly, it is not known if the matrix (K + S) in his linear system (K + S)U = D being solved for the interpolation problem would satisfy the conditions set forth in Beylkin et al., <ref> [2] </ref> in order for their bandwidth reduction scheme to be applicable in this case. Further, we found that his algorithm fails to converge in reasonable number of iterations to the correct solution for very sparse data that is used in the examples of this paper.

More recently, the capacitance matrix technique [5] has been generalized to solve the linear system arising from the early vision problems very efficiently [28, 17]. <p> Yaou and Chang [32] report a fast surface interpolation algorithm using the multiresolution wavelet transform. This work is almost exactly similar to that of Szeliski with the exception that Yaou and 4 Chang use a wavelet basis instead of the hierarchical basis and a Jacobi iteration <ref> [8] </ref> instead of the conjugate gradients used in Szeliski [22]. As in Szeliski, the full potential of a preconditioning technique was not exploited in Yaou and Chang i.e., the design of the preconditioner did not make use of any information about the problem being solved. <p> Since P is a positive-definite matrix, it can be shown that there exists a positive-definite matrix C such that C 2 = P <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> The stiffness matrix K is symmetric positive definite and therefore, the conjugate gradient algorithm can be used to solve the problem guaranteeing a unique solution. When a preconditioner P is used to accelerate the convergence, we have what is known as the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm (see <ref> [8] </ref>) given as follows. 0.

In [32], the biorthogonal wavelet basis transfer is used in the preconditioning process. We found that this wavelet basis transfer must be combined with appropriate scaling to improve the convergence, which was not mentioned in [32]. <p> Note that the preconditioner was used in a gradient decent iteration in [19]. In our experiments, the preconditioners are used in conjunction with the conjugate gradient algorithm, which is known to be much more efficient than a gradient decent algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. We use the sub-sampled data set in figure 3 (a) with a membrane stabilizer in a 32 fi 32 problem for testing this preconditioner. The convergence curves for Pentland's preconditioner with CG, CG and our APCG algorithms are shown in figure 8.

Reference-contexts: We develop a new formulation which modifies the Horn and Schunk formulation [13] to incorporate a separate condition along discontinuities in the image intensity <ref> [10] </ref>. This modification drastically enhances the performance of our method over other gradient-based methods because the optical flow constraint equation is invalid along intensity discontinuities and causes large errors in the computed flow. <p> G fl E) * u) + (r 2 G fl E) t ) 2 dx (6) Where u (x; t) = (u (x; t); v (x; t)) is the velocity field to be estimated, E is the image brightness function, and r 2 G is the Laplacian of Gaussian operator <ref> [10] </ref>. The first term is the gradient constraint which is active away from discontinuities, the second term is the smoothness constraint on the velocity field with controlling the contribution of the smoothness term and the third term is the flow constraint along edges which is disabled away from the edges. <p> Our APCG outperforms the other methods in terms of convergence speed for all of the three different measures. 34 5.3 Optical Flow Computation In section 2, we presented a new formulation of the optical flow computation problem. Our regularization-based formulation combines the region-based [13] and contour-based <ref> [10] </ref> gradient constraints. <p> In our implementation, we locate the zero-crossings of r 2 G fl E and label them as discontinuities <ref> [10] </ref>. Accurate estimation of E x , E y and E t is necessary to obtain a reliable flow constraint. When E is the brightness function, we use the Gaussian spatial-temporal pre-smoothing prior to applying the two-point central difference to approximate the partial derivatives.

For a comprehensive set of papers on this topic, we refer the reader to the book edited by Horn and Brooks [12] and the work in <ref> [24, 21, 11, 23] </ref>. In this problem, it is required to recover the shape of surfaces from image irradiance which depends on surface geometry and reflectance, scene illuminance and imaging geometry. <p> After discretization, we need to solve the system Kx = b. If the linear approximation of the reflectance function technique <ref> [11] </ref> is used to improve the convergence, the stiffness matrix K 2 &lt; 3Nfi3N has the following form. <p> Very accurate solution is obtained after 10 iterations of the APCG algorithm, as shown in figure 10 (b). 5.2 Shape from Shading For the shape-from-shading experiment, we use the synthetic bump images with size 64 fi 64 used in <ref> [23, 11] </ref>, as shown in figure 11. These two images are generated from the Lambertian reflectance model with the light source directions (p s ; q s ; 1) being (0:34; 0:3467; 1) and (0:34; 0:3467; 1) for the left and right images, respectively.

Reference-contexts: In fact, we always use 0 as the initial guess in our experiments. To resolve the above problem for minimizing the SFS energy function by gradient-based methods, we include the boundary conditions obtained from the occluding boundary <ref> [14] </ref> as an additional data constraint in the energy function to be minimized. By incorporating the boundary conditions into the SFS energy function, the CG-type algorithms can approach the true solution. In our experiment, we use the active contour model [16] to locate the occluding boundary at first. <p> In our experiment, we use the active contour model [16] to locate the occluding boundary at first. By using the property that the surface normal at a point on the occluding boundary is parallel to the normal of the silhouette in the image plane <ref> [14] </ref>, we impose the Direchelet boundary condition on (p; q) along the occluding boundary. In addition, we use the occluding boundary to incorporate the discontinuities in (p; q) or z representing orientation discontinuities or depth discontinuities respectively. In this experiment, we incorporate the orientation discontinuities along the occluding contour.

Reference-contexts: More recently, the capacitance matrix technique [5] has been generalized to solve the linear system arising from the early vision problems very efficiently <ref> [28, 17] </ref>. However, this technique can prove to be inefficient for dense data problems with nonuniform weighting on the data constraints, such as the optical flow problem, since the size of the associated ( dense ) capacitance matrix is too large.

Reference-contexts: The wavelet decomposition and reconstruction can be efficiently achieved via a QMF (Quadrature Mirror Filters) implementation as shown in figure 1 (see <ref> [18] </ref>).

In our experiment, we use the cubic B-spline wavelet given in <ref> [18] </ref> with the QMF filters truncated to a length of 11.

In [22, 23], Szeliski presented a preconditioning technique based on the use of hierarchical basis functions. <p> More recently, Pentland <ref> [19] </ref> presented a technique for surface interpolation using a change of basis to orthonormal wavelets as a preconditioning transform. <p> This compression takes O (N ) time if the structure of the singularities of the matrix are known a priori. There are three issues to be noted with regards to Pentland's reported results. Firstly, after a change of basis to orthonormal wavelets, the off-diagonal terms were discarded in <ref> [19] </ref>, under the claim that the transformed stiffness matrix was diagonally dominant. This diagonal dominance behavior was depicted via the profiling of a row of the transformed stiffness matrix at a high resolution. <p> This figure establishes the falsity of the diagonal dominance behavior of K s claimed in <ref> [19] </ref>. We attempted to incorporate the preconditioner developed in Pentland's [19] into the comparison however, we found that the convergence of conjugate gradient with this preconditioner is even slower than that of the CG algorithm (without preconditioning) for the very sparse data case. <p> This figure establishes the falsity of the diagonal dominance behavior of K s claimed in <ref> [19] </ref>.

We can see that Pentland's preconditioning is worse than the conjugate gradient iterations without preconditioning. This is because the diagonal dominance behavior of K s after wavelet transform claimed in <ref> [19] </ref> doesn't hold in general. Pentland's preconditioner was constructed by approximating 28 the wavelet transform of the stiffness matrix by its diagonal entries based on the diagonal dominance assumption of K s . <p> The falsity of the diagonal dominance claim is evident in figure 9 where we profile arbitrarily selected rows of the wavelet transformed membrane matrix K s of size (64 fi 64) for the 1D problem. In <ref> [19] </ref>, the preconditioner was chosen as the diagonal of the stiffness matrix K in the wavelet basis. Note that for the sparse data case, the matrix K s dominates K d .

Empirical convergence results were shown for preconditioned conjugate gradient in comparison with the standard conjugate gradient method. A key piece of information that was overlooked in Szeliski's work <ref> [22, 23] </ref> was that, in designing a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient algorithm, no information about the problem being solved was used i.e., once a basis set was chosen, the same preconditioner was used regardless of the imposed smoothness or data constraints. 3 Thus, the true power of a preconditioning transform <p> This work is almost exactly similar to that of Szeliski with the exception that Yaou and 4 Chang use a wavelet basis instead of the hierarchical basis and a Jacobi iteration [8] instead of the conjugate gradients used in Szeliski <ref> [22] </ref>.

The formulations involve minimization of an energy functional E, which is the sum of the energy contribution from the smoothness constraint (S) and the data constraint (P) (see <ref> [25, 22] </ref> for details of this formulation). For the surface reconstruction problem, we are faced with recovering surface shape from either sparse or dense range data.

Reference-contexts: This global-to-local shape recovery phenomenon can be predicted by the choice of the weighting function (i). In fact, the weighting function can be adapted during the iterations instead of following a preset schedule. The adaptation concept is similar to the adaptive step scheme in the 20 scale space tracking <ref> [31] </ref>. The preconditioner construction for the shape-from-shading and the optical flow computation problems is very similar to the one outlined here for the surface reconstruction problem.
