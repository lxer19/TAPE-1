Reference-contexts: In general, all of the algorithms above for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems are divided into two classes: integral equation methods and differential equation methods <ref> [2, 31] </ref>. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Since the 1960s, breakthroughs and developments in one group or the other have made 5 researchers and users shift back and forth from one class to the other.

Therefore, there is a demand for faster and more accurate algorithms that are able to solve more general, inhomogeneous, three-dimensional (3-D) scattering problems. <p> Few heterogeneous geometries yield explicit solutions, thus research in the discipline has focused on numerical techniques. Despite the tremendous progress made in recent years, the calculation of induced electromagnetic (EM) fields in irregularly shaped, heterogeneous dielectric bodies is still a difficult problem <ref> [37] </ref>.

We shall consider here only the case of (2.1), since that of (2.2) is almost exactly the same. One dimensional Sinc-convolution is based on the following: 1. In [40] Stenger determined the Sinc basis T for approximating functions over an arbitrary interval (a; b) such that for a <p> (x) = x for x 2 (a; b): The procedure for obtaining these approximations is described in detail in <ref> [40] </ref>, Section 4.6.

A.1 Sinc Function, Cardinal Function In engineering literature, the term sinc (z) is well known; it is defined by sinc (z) = sin (z) : (A.1) However, there exists a more powerful notation for the sinc function, also known as Cardinal function. <p> and k is an integer, then the Cardinal function, S (k; h), is defined by S (k; h) ffi (z) = (z kh)=h 97 S (k; h) shall thus be referred to as the k 0 th Sinc function with step size h; evaluated at z: It is proven (see <ref> [40, 41, 28, 26] </ref> for proofs) that for h &gt; 0, the sequence h 1=2 S (k; h) k=1 is a complete orthonormal sequence in a certain Wiener space of functions. <p> (1) where ffi k = 2 (A.7) Z k sin (t) dt: Moreover, for all z 2 C, Z z f (t) dt = h k=1 &lt; 1 X k` f (`h) = S (k; h) ffi (z): (A.8) 98 Again, the proofs for the above claims are documented in <ref> [40] </ref>. <p> Chapter 3 in this dissertation): D = z 2 C : fi fi arg z fi fi 101 onto the strip D d : This selection of enables us to consider problems whose solution f are analytic in the "eye-shaped" region D; and which satisfy the relation (For proofs, see <ref> [40] </ref>): fi fi fi (T z)f (0) zf (T ) fi fi fi Similarly, for indefinite x-axis and y-axis intervals where (a; b) = (1; +1); one can define by w = (z) = z; (A.18) this function provides a conformal transformation of "the strip" region (see Fig. (3.3) in chapter <p> in chapter 3 of the dissertation text): D = fz 2 C : j=zj &lt; dg ; (A.19) onto the strip D d : This selection of enables us to consider problems whose solution f are analytic in the "strip" region D; and which satisfy the relation (For proofs, see <ref> [40] </ref>): e ffjzj and e fijzj Finally, for semidefinite z-axis interval where (a; b) = (0; 1); one can define either by w = (z) = ln (sinh (z)); (A.22) 102 which provides a conformal transformation of "bullet shape" region (see Fig. (3.4) of Chapter 3 in this dissertation): D = <p> the sector region D; and which satisfy the relation f (z) f (0) = O (jzj ff ) ; as z ! 0 (A.28) f (z) f (+1) = O jzj fi : as z ! 1 (A.29) 103 The analysis and proofs for these statements are documented in reference <ref> [40] </ref>. All of these mapping functions, (there are several other mappings of the same class possible for problems on R), guarantee the same order of accuracy in the final approximations in M ff;fi (D). <p> Thus, the rapid convergence of Sinc-convolution approximation method described in this dissertation as well as other Sinc based approximation methods, many of them described in details and documented in <ref> [40, 28] </ref>, are guaranteed.
