Abstract: We study the following problem. Suppose G is a graph and TC G its transitive closure. If G 0 is a new graph obtained from G by inserting or deleting an edge e, can the new transitive closure TC G 0 be defined in first-order logic using G, TC G and e? In this paper, we show that the answer is positive for (1) acyclic graphs (main result), (2) graphs where the vertices of the deleted edge are not in the same strongly-connected component, and (3) graphs where there exists at most one path between each pair of vertices (0-1-path graphs). It is left open whether the new transitive closure is definable in first-order logic for all graphs. We also consider the first-order on-line computation of the dominator relation.

Reference-contexts: Then for D = f (ff; fi)g, there is a first-order formula defining TC GD from G, D, and TC G . 2 6 We conclude this section by briefly considering the computation of dominators <ref> (cf. Aho et al 1974) </ref> (using a slightly more general definition).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Transitive closure is an interesting and useful database query in many practical applications. Unfortunately, the transitive closure query cannot be expressed in first-order logic, or equivalently, the relational calculus and algebra <ref> (Aho and Ullman 1979) </ref>. Previous work considered extending first-order query languages to express the transitive closure query (Aho and Ullman 1979; Chandra and Harel 1980, 1985) and, in particular, efficient algorithms for evaluating the transitive closure query (Yannakakis 1990; Lu 1987).

Reference-contexts: Can the new transitive closure TC G 0 be defined in first order using G, TC G and e? For the insertion case, it was known that the answer to this question is yes <ref> (Dong and Topor 1992) </ref>. Unfortunately, the deletion case is more difficult and requires new techniques.

Reference-contexts: Organizationally, Section 2 reviews some basic terminologies and introduces the notion of first-order incremental/decremental definability, and Sections 3 and 4 consider acyclic and 0-1-path graphs (resp.). 1 2 Basic Definitions We review the basic notions of relations and the transitive closure query <ref> (familiarity with the relational model, e.g. Ullman 1988, is assumed) </ref> and then present the central notions of first-order incremental and decremental definability of the transitive closure query.
