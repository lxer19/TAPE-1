Abstract: This paper reports on the learning of spatial concepts in the L 0 project. The challenge of designing an architecture capable of learning spatial concepts from any of the world's languages is first highlighted by reviewing the spatial systems of a number of languages which differ strikingly from English in this regard. A partially structured connectionist architecture is presented which has successfully learned concepts from the languages outlined. In this architecture, highly structured subnetworks, specialized for the spatial concept learning task, feed into an unstructured, fully-connected upper subnetwork. The system's success at the learning task is attributed on the one hand to the constrained search space which results from structuring, and on the other hand to the flexibility afforded by the unstructured upper subnetwork.

Reference-contexts: a role in terms such as "along". 2 an auf LM LM moddhay, bhethoray moddhay LM LM 3 "moddhay" is applicable in any situation in which the trajector is at least somewhat inside the landmark, while the term "bhethoray" is reserved for those situations in which the inclusion is complete <ref> [Ahmad, 1990] </ref>. 2.4 Some Others An exhaustive cataloging of cross-linguistic variations in spatial systems is well beyond the scope of this paper, and indeed probably beyond the scope of any single paper. Nonetheless, there are a number of additional phenomena from other languages which deserve mention.

Reference-contexts: This paper provides an overview of the current system, including several features not covered in the earlier papers. 2 Crosslinguistic Variation in Spatial Systems As pointed out in <ref> [Brugman, 1983; Bowerman, 1989; Talmy, 1983] </ref>, among others, languages differ dramatically in the ways in which they express spatial relations. <p> In this example, Mixtec is picking up on a visual feature which English is not, namely the orientation of the major axis of the landmark. 1 2.2 German Interestingly, even closely related languages can differ substantively in their spatial systems, as pointed out in <ref> [Bowerman, 1989] </ref>. Figure 3 shows two scenes which would both be classified as "on" in English, but which do not fall in the same category in German. <p> mostly loose, and hanging by a corner. * Korean: the verbs "kki-ta" and "ppay-ta" can be used only when there is a tight fit between the landmark and trajector (e.g. a ring on a finger, a finger in a ring, a lid on a jar, a cassette in its case) <ref> [Bowerman, 1989] </ref>. * Palestinian colloquial Arabic: the term "fawq", usually glossed as "up" or "above", can also be used to refer to situations in which there is contact between trajector and landmark provided the trajector is located high with respect to the deictic center.

Reference-contexts: For example, the English lexeme "in" may be used to denote either static inclusion: The ball is in the box. or motion into a situation of inclusion, synonymously with "into": He walked in the room. 15 The structure of some polysemous locative terms have been worked out in detail (e.g. <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref> on English "over"), and accounting for such data will be a focus of work in the near future. 9 Conclusions The connectionist system presented in this report was designed to learn spatial concepts from arbitrary natural languages.

Thus, a trajector above a long, wide landmark is considered to be located at the landmark's "animal-back", by analogy to the dorsum of a horizontally-extended quadruped.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned earlier, the motivation behind this is the desire to capture, in a single network, the learning tractability afforded by structuring, and the flexibility in feature combination which results from unstructured hidden layers. 7 Results The system was trained under quickprop <ref> [Fahlman, 1988] </ref>, a variant of back-propagation which exhibits fast convergence. Figure 10 presents a typical training set, that for the English preposition "on". Here, nine positive instances of "on" are presented in (a), and nine negative instances in (b).

Reference-contexts: This yields a very simple center-surround receptive field. * The weights of corresponding links at different positions are constrained to be identical (see <ref> [LeCun, 1989] </ref> for details on this technique of weight-sharing). In addition, all links in the surround are constrained to be of the same weight.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, in Figure 6, the proximal orientation is perfectly aligned with upright vertical, while the CoM orientation is not. All orientations in the system are represented in (sin,cos) pairs. Given this, we can easily measure the degree of alignment of two orientations by using a Gaussian (see <ref> [Moody and Darken, 1988] </ref> for earlier work using Gaussian nodes in a somewhat different way in connectionist networks): f (sin i ; cos i ) = exp [ 2 ] (1) where (sin i ; cos i ) encodes the relational orientation, and (sin ; cos ) encodes the reference orientation
