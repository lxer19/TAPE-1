Title: VISOR: Schema-based Scene Analysis with Structured Neural Networks

Abstract: A novel approach to object recognition and scene analysis based on neural network representation of visual schemas is described. Given an input scene, the VISOR system focuses attention successively at each component, and the schema representations cooperate and compete to match the inputs. The schema hierarchy is learned from examples through unsupervised adaptation and reinforcement learning. VISOR learns that some objects are more important than others in identifying the scene, and that the importance of spatial relations varies depending on the scene. As the inputs differ increasingly from the schemas, VISOR's recognition process is remarkably robust, and automatically generates a measure of confidence in the analysis.

Reference-contexts: Following Biederman's theory of human object perception <ref> [2] </ref>, the feature pattern describes shape attributes such as length, breadth, closure, vertical tilt, horizontal tilt, degree of expansion, and curvature. Each attribute is represented by a set of feature cells that are maximally sensitive to different ranges of values (e.g., small, medium, large).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The basic paradigm in many image understanding systems is the "hypothesize and test" technique <ref> [3, 14] </ref>. The system contains a large number of models that represent typical objects and scenes. Based on the input image, the system invokes models that are likely to match the scene well|a process called hypothesis activation.

Reference-contexts: If the focused object is a region with approximately uniform texture but no specific shape (such as a grass patch), the texture of the region is extracted and encoded in the texture feature cells (Fig. 2). Based on the model of Bovik et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, each texture feature cell corresponds to the output of a filter channel that is maximally sensitive to a particular type of texture. The featural and positional information extracted by the LLVM are fed into the Schema Module (Fig. 1c) where it is matched with the schema representations.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the environment will deliver a punishment signal to VISOR, suppressing the knife schema-net's activation so that a different schema-net can become most active. The punishment signal is analogous to the mismatch-reset signal in the ART network <ref> [5] </ref>. It tells the Schema Module to find a different schema-net for the spoon without specifying which one.

Reference-contexts: The process continues until the system discovers a set of consistent hypotheses that best matches the scene. This set constitutes an interpretation of the scene. The "hypothesize and test" technique involves tedious and complex search procedures. Alternatively, it can be formulated in terms of interactions among visual schemas <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. The models are replaced by object and scene schemas that cooperate and compete to match the inputs. Data-driven and expectation-driven activation of hypotheses becomes simple bottom-up and top-down activation of schemas.

Reference-contexts: Connectionist schema systems have been proposed before [1], and there are systems that simulate parts of the process such as hierarchical structures <ref> [7, 9] </ref>, cooperation and competition [13], and dynamic bindings [10].
