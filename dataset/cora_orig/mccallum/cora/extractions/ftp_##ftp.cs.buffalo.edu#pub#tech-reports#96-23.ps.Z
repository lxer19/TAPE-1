Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction There is an increasing demand on capacity of video servers in large-scale video-on-demand systems <ref> [8, 1] </ref>. Interactive scan operations, such as fast-forward and fast-backward 1 are desirable features in video-on-demand and other multimedia servers. It is necessary to provide efficient supports for interactive operations with Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantee.

Reference-contexts: Such a fine-grain partition presents the largest flexibility of video data distribution. However, it may suffer large overhead depending on disk seek and rotation penalty, as well as disk scheduling. This scheme has been used in project MARS <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 In case of MPEG compression [7], the video frames are varied in size and possess some dependencies. Usually, several frames can be grouped together so that the frames that depend on each other are confined into the same group as a group of picture. <p> Moreover, a general 17 segment layout scheme is proposed for arbitrary values of the ff ratio and the number of storage nodes for a balanced load. Different data layout schemes for interactive operations to maximize support of different ff ratios have been described in <ref> [2] </ref>. Their technique is applied to fine-grain blocks or segments. Also, a method is de-scibed to divide the sequence of frames into two sequences: a sequence of frames from a single storage node for normal playout followed by frames from possibly all storage nodes for fast-forward.

Reference-contexts: A number of works describe clustered systems [13, 10, 11]. The clustered architecture can be extended to the direct-access architecture which provides an interface between the storage system and the network. Project MARS uses an ATM-based interconnect to connect storage devices to an ATM-based broadband network <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, we assume a clustered architecture. Figure 1 shows a diagram of clustered video servers. The storage nodes, each with a local disk array, are responsible for storing video data in some storage medium, such as disks.

Reference-contexts: The small granularity may lead to high bookkeeping overhead and storage access cost. Though this assumption might not be realistic, this study provides a basic strategy for scheduling interactive operations. Furthermore, this method can be extended to segments which includes a number of continuous frames. An experiment described in <ref> [4] </ref> found that the client got the impression of watching each scene (segment) at regular speed with jumps between scenes, similar to watching a slide projector operating at a high speed. Clients can see the details in each scene so that they are able to locate the position of interest. <p> Scans to points outside of the VCR-window requires renegotiation. Displaying frames at a higher speed yields an f -fold increase in the bandwidth. The bandwidth requirement can be reduced by skip frames. A segment skipping approach for interactive operations has been proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach can solve the bandwidth problem and is easy to implement. It is found that the segment skipping is an acceptable method for fast-forward and fast-backward.

Reference-contexts: Previous Work Interactive operations can be accommodated by display frames at a rate higher than the normal playout. An analysis shows that statistical guarantees can be provided by reserving only a small portion of its total bandwidth if a small percentage of requests are interactive <ref> [5] </ref>. Bandwidth smoothing techniques are used to solve the bandwidth problem for interactive operations [6]. It provides the ff and fb capacity within a VCR-window by using large buffers. Scans to points outside of the VCR-window requires renegotiation.

Reference-contexts: The video data is sent to the memory buffer through a high-speed network or bus, and then to the clients. A mass storage system has presented the capacity of supporting hundreds of requests <ref> [9] </ref>. However, it is not yet clear that a multiprocessor video server can be scalable. A clustered architecture is easy to scale to thousands of server nodes. In such a system, a set of storage nodes and a set of delivery nodes are connected by an interconnection network. <p> Depending on a selected block size s and the base stream rate R, time is divided into time cycles, where the length of a cycle is t f = s=R. The optimal block size is around 256 KBytes to 512 KBytes <ref> [11, 13, 9] </ref>, and an MPEG-2 compressed video rate is about 0.5 MBytes/sec. In general, the data transfer rate of a single disk or a disk array can be much higher than base stream rate R.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, either higher bandwidth must be allocated or the quality of interactive operations must be reduced. Here, we assume that the low-resolution component will be retrieved to keep the bandwidth invariant <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus, the size of 1=f frames can be the same of 1=f of the size of all frames. The prefetching approach can be applied to intra-block skipping. <p> This idea is similar to the grouping approach. A method has been described by using the characteristics of video streams and human perceptual tolerances to reduce the bandwidth of interactive operations <ref> [12] </ref>. Combining sub-stream block placement and access of low-resolution component of the base sub-stream, the bandwidth of interactive operations can be reduced to the same as the normal playout. This technique is applied to the coarse-grain blocks. 7.

In this paper, we assume a clustered architecture. <p> The logical storage and delivery nodes can be mapped to different physical nodes of the cluster. This configuration is called the two-tier architecture in <ref> [13] </ref>. Also, a node can be both a storage node and a delivery node, called the flat architecture. 3. Data Layout and Scheduling We assume that a number of video files are stored in a parallel storage server of N storage nodes. <p> Depending on a selected block size s and the base stream rate R, time is divided into time cycles, where the length of a cycle is t f = s=R. The optimal block size is around 256 KBytes to 512 KBytes <ref> [11, 13, 9] </ref>, and an MPEG-2 compressed video rate is about 0.5 MBytes/sec. In general, the data transfer rate of a single disk or a disk array can be much higher than base stream rate R.

Reference-contexts: The conflict-free schedule is a schedule where in each time slot, no two video streams request a block from the same storage node. The algorithms for scheduling normal playout have been presented in <ref> [14] </ref>. In this paper, we will propose scheduling algorithms for interactive operations. Since fast-forward (ff) and fast-backward (fb) impose similar requirements, the techniques developed for ff can easily be extended to fb. Thus, we will only discuss the ff operation. <p> Scheduling algorithms can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. 2 Assume there are K groups in the system. The following lemma gives the sufficient condition for expanding. <p> If (g j mod N ) = 0, apply expanding to allocate one time slot and schedule request r k to the time slot. Otherwise, schedule r k to one of the empty spaces. If all empty spaces have conflict, algorithms described in <ref> [14] </ref> can be applied to obtain a conflict-free schedule. 2 Sometimes the shrinking operation can be postponed until an expanding operation needs a free time slot. This is called lazy shrinking. Lazy shrinking can avoid unnecessary re-scheduling. 15 An example is shown in Figure 9.
