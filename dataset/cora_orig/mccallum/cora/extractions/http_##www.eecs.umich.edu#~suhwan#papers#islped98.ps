Abstract: In dynamic logic families that rely on energy recovery to achieve low energy dissipation, the flow of data through cascaded gates is controlled using multi-phase clocks. Consequently, these families require multiple clock generators and can exhibit increased energy consumption on their clock distribution networks. Moreover, they are not attractive for high-speed design due to clock skew management problems. In this paper, we present TSEL, the first energy-recovering logic family that operates with a single-phase clocking scheme. TSEL outperforms previous energy-recovering logic families in terms of energy efficiency and operating speed. In HSPICE simulations with a standard 0.5m technology from MOSIS, pipelined carry-lookahead adders in TSEL function correctly for operating frequencies exceeding 280MHz. For operating frequencies above 80MHz, they dissipate considerably less energy per operation than alternative implementations of the same adder architecture in other energy-recovering logic families. In comparison with their CMOS counterparts, the TSEL adders dissipate about half as much energy at 280MHz. Our results indicate that TSEL is an excellent candidate for high speed and low power VLSI system design.
