DAAL03-90-G- 0008. This paper considers an optimal control problem for sampled- data systems. After defining a new norm for sampled-data systems, we give a state space solution to the optimal controller synthesis problem. We show that the optimal control problem for a sampled-data system is equivalent to a standard optimal control problem for a related discrete-time system.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if we find the optimal FDLSI discrete-time controller for the equivalent FDLSI discrete-time plant, then we have a solution to the main synthesis problem. The problem of finding (or ) optimal controllers for FDLSI discrete-time systems is by now a classical problem <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. In the next section, we define the -norm for sampled-data systems and also pose the main synthesis problem. In Section 3, we solve the optimal control problem in state-space form. We conclude the paper with some remarks regarding current and future research directions.

Reference-contexts: This in particular implies that the inter-sample behavior must be taken into account. There have been some studies of the linear-quadratic regulator problem for sampled-data systems taking inter-sample behavior into account, see for example [15, 6, 13]. Recently, Chen and Francis <ref> [5] </ref> have formulated and solved an optimal control problem for sampled-data systems, while the optimal control problem has been investigated by Kabamba and Hara [9, 10], Chen and Francis [4], Toivonen [17], and Bamieh and Pearson [2]. <p> For a multi-input system, one applies delta functions at each input channel and then take the square root of the sum of integral squares of the resulting outputs.) Chen and Francis <ref> [5] </ref> generalize precisely this concept of the norm to sampled-data systems and solve the corresponding optimal control problem. <p> Motivated by the recent work of Chen and Francis <ref> [5] </ref>, in this paper, we define a new norm for sampled-data systems. We begin by considering a general exponentially stable linear periodic input-output system, and define an norm for it. <p> The set is a discrete set (see [11]). Thus, if the sampling time is chosen outside then is also stabilizable and detectable. In this case, admits an internally stabilizing controller. The following follows directly from <ref> [5] </ref>. ( ) ( ) We will next introduce a few matrix factorizations.

Reference-contexts: This notion of the norm for periodic systems leads to a suitable definition of the norm for sampled-data systems. Our notion of the norm is also closely related to the work of Juan and Kabamba <ref> [7] </ref> who have investigated the use of Generalized Sampled-Data Hold Function Control (GSHF) to optimize quadratic performance measures for sampled-data systems. We then consider the synthesis problem for optimal control of sampled-data systems.
