Title: Using lexical chains to build hypertext links in newspaper articles

Abstract: We discuss an automatic method for the construction of hypertext links within and between newspaper articles. The method comprises three steps: determining the lexical chains in a text, building links between the paragraphs of articles, and building links between articles. Lexical chains capture the semantic relations between words that occur throughout a text. Each chain is a set of related words that captures a portion of the cohesive structure of a text. By considering the distribution of chains within an article, we can build links between the paragraphs. By comparing the chains contained in two different articles, we can decide whether or not to place a link between them. We also present the results of an experiment designed to measure inter-linker consistency in the manual construction of hypertext links between the paragraphs of newspaper articles. The results show that inter-linker consistency is low, but better than that obtained in a previous experiment.

Reference-contexts: The chains can be built using any lexical resource that relates words semantically. While the original work was done using Roget's Thesaurus (Chapman 1992), our current chainer (St-Onge 1995) uses the WordNet database <ref> (Beckwith et al. 1991) </ref>. Each type of link between WordNet synsets is assigned a direction of up, down, or horizontal. Upward links correspond to generalization, for example, an upward link from apple to fruit indicates that fruit is more general than apple.

Reference-contexts: Morris and Hirst (1991) showed that the organization of the lexical chains contained in a document mirrors, in some sense, the discourse structure of that document. The chains can be built using any lexical resource that relates words semantically. While the original work was done using Roget's Thesaurus <ref> (Chapman 1992) </ref>, our current chainer (St-Onge 1995) uses the WordNet database (Beckwith et al. 1991). Each type of link between WordNet synsets is assigned a direction of up, down, or horizontal.

Reference-contexts: With this in mind, we are currently working on a method for automatically constructing hypertext links within and between newspaper articles using lexical chains <ref> (Morris & Hirst 1991) </ref>. Testing inter-linker consistency When automatically constructing hypertext, we need to know when we have generated a "good" hypertext. The obvious choice is to take manually linked hypertexts and assume that they are "good", and then train our algorithm to produce similar hypertexts. <p> A possible followup experiment would determine how humans would place links between articles. In this case, it seems that the decisions as to which articles are related would be more straightforward, and we would therefore expect to see a greater consistency between linkers. Lexical chains Lexical chains <ref> (Morris & Hirst 1991) </ref> are sequences of semantically related words that occur throughout a text. Generally speaking, a document will contain many chains, each of which captures a portion of the cohesive structure of the document.
