Abstract: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of a single site in the somatosensory cortex of rats and monkeys for 2-6 hours produces a large increase in the number of neurons responsive to the skin region corresponding to the ICMS-site receptive field (RF), with very little effect on the position and size of the ICMS-site RF, and the response evoked at the ICMS site by tactile stimulation (Recanzone et al., 1992b). Large changes in RF topography are observed following several weeks of repetitive stimulation of a restricted skin region in monkeys (Jenkins et al., 1990; Recanzone et al., 1992acde). Repetitive stimulation of a localized skin region in monkeys produced by training the monkeys in a tactile frequency discrimination task improves their performance (Recanzone et al., 1992a). It has been suggested that these changes in RF topography are caused by competitive learning in excitatory pathways (Grajski & Merzenich, 1990; Jenkins et al., 1990; Recanzone et al., 1992abcde). ICMS almost simultaneously excites excitatory and inhibitory terminals and excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons within a few microns of the stimulating electrode. Thus, this paper investigates the implications of the possibility that lateral inhibitory pathways too may undergo synaptic plasticity during ICMS. Lateral inhibitory pathways may also undergo synaptic plasticity in adult animals during peripheral conditioning. The "EXIN" (afferent excitatory and lateral inhibitory) synaptic plasticity rules
