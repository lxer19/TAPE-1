Reference-contexts: Several years of work on multicast group communication protocols have produced a number of systems that provide these services, including Isis [7], Horus [18], Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) [19], Trans/Total [12], Transis [2] and Totem <ref> [1, 14] </ref>. All of these systems were designed for local-area networks (LANs) and do not, in general, scale well to large numbers of nodes and wide-area networks, such as the Internet. With the increasing popularity of the Internet, there is an increasing interest in protocols that are scalable. <p> As an example of message delivery guarantees in existing group communication systems, we now consider those defined by the Totem system <ref> [1, 14] </ref>. Totem provides two message delivery guarantees: agreed delivery and safe delivery. Agreed delivery guarantees that the message is in a total order with respect to messages from the current processes that comprise the application.

Reference-contexts: The coordinator then multicasts this timestamp to its local group, thus allowing every process in its local group to remove those messages from its message buffers. Further details about the timestamp acknowledgment mechanisms can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.1.2 Reliable Message Delivery The InterGroup protocols use an SRM-based approach to negative acknowledgments, adapting the algorithms in [9]. Due to space constraints, we present here only an outline of the reliable delivery protocols. More details can be found in [3].

Reference-contexts: Timestamped delivery and certified delivery are the strongest message delivery guarantees provided by the InterGroup protocols. The weaker ones are not mentioned here because they do not fall into the traditional guarantees provided by group communication protocols. They are discussed in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 The Logical Hierarchies of InterGroup The InterGroup system employs two orthogonal logical hierarchies to achieve scalability. The first is a self-organizing two-level hierarchy of nodes, adapted from that of SRM [17], whose structure depends on the nodes in the physical network. <p> To simplify the explanations, we assume that all of the processes request timestamped delivery on startup. A more general description involving the other cases and heterogeneity of the message delivery guarantees is presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.1 The Node Hierarchy The logical structure of this hierarchy considers the location of, and the latencies between, nodes in order to reduce the global control traffic of the protocols and allow scalable buffer management and reliable message delivery.

Reference-contexts: The coordinator group of the hierarchy consists of all coordinators in the hierarchy. The coordinator group membership supports a form of virtual synchrony in order to perform buffer management correctly (for more details see <ref> [6] </ref>). <p> This is done using timers and Keep Alive messages that each sender transmits when it has no data messages to send. The membership repair algorithm and sender fault detection are described in more detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 Conclusion The motivation for the InterGroup protocols is the lack of a group communication system that is scalable and runs effectively over the Internet. In this paper we have given an overview of the InterGroup suite of group communication protocols.

Reference-contexts: For multicasting, sender-initiated protocols suffer from the ACK implosion problem; thus, focus has shifted to the other classes of protocols. Receiver-initiated protocols with NACK-avoidance (RINA) have been shown [16] to improve performance over the basic receiver-initiated protocols, which suffer from the NACK implosion problem. SRM <ref> [9] </ref> and LBRM [10] are two examples of RINA protocols. Because they do not use ACKs, these protocols still suffer from the need for the application (SRM) or a hierarchy of log servers (LBRM) to keep the entire global state. <p> Further details about the timestamp acknowledgment mechanisms can be found in [4]. 4.1.2 Reliable Message Delivery The InterGroup protocols use an SRM-based approach to negative acknowledgments, adapting the algorithms in <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is no service provided that determines who received the message or even who the group members are. Reliable multicast protocols can be classified <ref> [11, 16] </ref> as sender-initiated, receiver-initiated with NACK-avoidance and tree-based protocols. Sender-initiated protocols place the responsibility for retransmission on the sender alone.

It has been shown <ref> [11] </ref> that tree-based protocols do not suffer from the problems encountered in the other classes of protocols, but currently they require manual setup of the retransmission tree.
