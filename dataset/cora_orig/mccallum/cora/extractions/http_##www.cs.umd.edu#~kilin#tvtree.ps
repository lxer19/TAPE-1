Abstract: We propose a file structure to index high-dimensionality data, typically, points in some feature space. The idea is to use only a few of the features, utilizing additional features whenever the additional discriminatory power is absolutely necessary. We present in detail the design of our tree structure and the associated algorithms that handle such `varying length' feature vectors. Finally we report simulation results, comparing the proposed structure with the R fl -tree, which is one of the most successful methods for low-dimensionality spaces. The results illustrate the superiority of our method, with up to 80% savings in disk accesses.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to aid forecasting, by examining similar patterns that may have appeared in the past. In <ref> [1] </ref> we used as features the co-efficients of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). * Multimedia databases, with audio (voice, music), video etc. [25]. <p> Since the retained components carry most of the information, the JPEG standard achieves good compression with negligible loss of image quality. We have observed similar behavior for the Discrete Fourier Transform in time series <ref> [1] </ref>. For example, random walks (also known as brown noise or brownian walks) exhibit a skewed spectrum, with the lower-frequency components being the strongest (and, therefore, most `important' for indexing). Specifically, the amplitude spectrum is approximately O (f 1 ), where f is the frequency).

Reference-contexts: Users might want to retrieve, eg., similar music scores, or video clips. * DNA databases where there is a large collection of strings from a four-letter alphabet (A,G,C,T); a new string has to be matched against the old strings, to find the best candidates. The BLAST algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> uses successive overlapping n-grams to index on. Regarding n-grams as features, we need 4 n features or 1,024 features for n=5. * Searching for names or addresses, say in a customer (mailing) list, where these are partially specified or have errors.

Reference-contexts: John Smith" instead of "Dr. J. Smith, Jr." Similar applications include spelling, typing [22] and OCR error correction [20]. There, given a wrong string, we should search a dictionary to find the closest strings to it. Triplets of letters are often used <ref> [3] </ref> to assess the similarity of two words, in which case we have at least 26 3 = 17,576 features per word (assuming that words consist exclusively of the 26 English letters, ignoring digits, upper-case letters etc.).

Reference-contexts: For colors, we used the color histograms (64-256 attributes per image) as feature vectors; for shapes we used the first 20 moments. * Medical databases, where 1-d objects (eg., ECGs), 2-d images (eg., X-rays) and 3-d images (eg., MRI brain scans) <ref> [4] </ref> are stored. Ability to retrieve quickly past cases with similar symptoms would be valuable for diagnosis, as well as for medical teaching and research purposes. * Time series, such as financial databases with stock-price movements.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 lists the conclusions. 2 Survey As mentioned above, for a variety of applications, feature extraction functions map objects into points in feature space; these points must be stored in a spatial access method. The prevailing methods form three classes: (a) R fl -trees <ref> [6] </ref> and the rest of the R-tree family [14, 18]; (b) linear quadtrees [31]; and (c) grid-files [27]. Different kinds of queries arise; the most typical ones are listed below: * Exact match queries. Find if a given query object is in the database.

Reference-contexts: Their results show that each data structure is suited for different kind of queries. However most multidimensional indexing methods explode exponentially with the dimensionality, eventually reducing to sequential scanning. For linear quadtrees, the effort is proportional to the hypersurface bounding the query region <ref> [17] </ref>; the hypersurface grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Grid files face similar problems, since they require a directory that grows exponentially with the dimensionality.
