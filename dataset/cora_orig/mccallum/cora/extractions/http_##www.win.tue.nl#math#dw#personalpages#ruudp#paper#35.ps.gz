Title: ON WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS AND THE REDUNDANCY OF IMPROVED GEOMETRIC GOPPA CODES  
Author: RUUD PELLIKAAN AND FERNANDO TORRES 
Abstract: Improved geometric Goppa codes have a smaller redundancy and the same bound on the minimum as ordinary algebraic geometry codes. For an asymp totically good sequence of function fields we give a formula for the redundancy.

Reference-contexts: Let H be a numerical set of genus g and C 2 N such that C c (H). Then, 1. ae l+1 (H) = g + l for l C g. This follows from G (H) [0; c (H)] [0; C]. 2. H has at least g non-gaps in <ref> [1; 2g] </ref>. Remark 3.3. Let H be a numerical semigroup of genus g. <p> In fact, suppose that c 2g + 1. Let n 1 ; : : : ; n g be non-gaps of H in <ref> [1; 2g] </ref> (cf. Remark 3.2 (2)). Then H would have g + 1 gaps, namely c 1; c 1 n g ; : : : ; c 1 n 1 , a contradiction. 3. <p> + 2 (resp. 0 l ) if ae 1 = 0 (resp. ae 1 1); 1 l C g 1; j j = 1; : : : ; C g; l g + 1 if l 2C g; where ae 0 := 0, 0 l (H; C) := #fi 2 <ref> [1; ae l+1 1] </ref> : i; ae l+1 i 2 Hg ;(3.2) l = l (H; C) := #fae l+1 ae Cg ; : : : ; ae l+1 ae j g " H j = 1; : : : ; C g :(3.3) The proof of the proposition follows from <p> By the remark stated before the proposition, we can assume l 1, i.e. ae l+1 1. Lemma 3.5. Let H = (ae l : l 2 N) be a numerical set of genus g. For l 2 N set l = l (H) := #fi 2 <ref> [1; ae l+1 1] </ref> : i; ae l+1 i 2 G (H)g : 1. Then l = 2l + 1 ae l+1 + l . 2. Let C 2 N such that C c (H). <p> Then l = (ae l+1 + 1) 2 (ae l+1 l) + #(A " B). Since (i; j) 2 A " B , 0 &lt; i &lt; ae l+1 ; i; ae l+1 i 2 G (H) ; the proof follows. (2) Let i 2 <ref> [1; ae l+1 1] </ref> be such that i; ae l+1 i 2 G (H). <p> Let ae l+1 2C 2. We consider two cases according as ae l+1 C 1 (, 0 l C g 1; cf. Remark 3.2 (1)) or ae l+1 C (, l C g; cf. loc. cit.). Case 1: ae l+1 2 <ref> [1; C 1] </ref>: Here we have l = ae l+1 1 #fi 2 [1; ae l+1 1] : i 2 H or ae l+1 i 2 Hg l : Now, since # [1; ae l+1 1] " H = l 1 if ae 1 = 0 ; we obtain Lemma 3.5 <p> We consider two cases according as ae l+1 C 1 (, 0 l C g 1; cf. Remark 3.2 (1)) or ae l+1 C (, l C g; cf. loc. cit.). Case 1: ae l+1 2 [1; C 1]: Here we have l = ae l+1 1 #fi 2 <ref> [1; ae l+1 1] </ref> : i 2 H or ae l+1 i 2 Hg l : Now, since # [1; ae l+1 1] " H = l 1 if ae 1 = 0 ; we obtain Lemma 3.5 (2) for l 2 [1; C g 1]. <p> Case 1: ae l+1 2 [1; C 1]: Here we have l = ae l+1 1 #fi 2 <ref> [1; ae l+1 1] </ref> : i 2 H or ae l+1 i 2 Hg l : Now, since # [1; ae l+1 1] " H = l 1 if ae 1 = 0 ; we obtain Lemma 3.5 (2) for l 2 [1; C g 1]. <p> have l = ae l+1 1 #fi 2 [1; ae l+1 1] : i 2 H or ae l+1 i 2 Hg l : Now, since # [1; ae l+1 1] " H = l 1 if ae 1 = 0 ; we obtain Lemma 3.5 (2) for l 2 <ref> [1; C g 1] </ref>. <p> Question 3.8. Which H do satisfy (3.5) for each d 2 [0; 2c (H) 2g (H) 1], or equivalently (3.6) for each d 2 <ref> [1; 2c (H) 2g (H)] </ref>? Next we are going to study Condition (3.6). For C c (H), we set * I (0) = I (0) (H; C) := [0; C g 1]; * S j * s j d (H; C). Remark 3.9. <p> Now the results follows from Remark 3.9 (1). (2) It follows from the fact that l C g whenever l 2 I (0) . Corollary 3.11. Let H and C be as in Proposition 3.4. Then s 2C2g 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and s 2C2g1 2 [ae Cg ae Cg1 1; ae Cg ae Cg1 + 1]. Moreover, 1. If C g 2, then s 2C2g = 1 , ae Cg+1 ae Cg ae Cg ae Cg1 . WEIERSTRASS SEMIGROUPS AND IMPROVED GOPPA CODES 11 2. <p> Proposition 3.15. With the above notations and assumptions, if H satisfies condition (3:6) for each d 2 N, then ~ H does. Proof. We have to show that ~ H satisfies (3.6) for each d 2 <ref> [1; 2~c 2~g] </ref>. We are going to apply Proposition 3.4 and its corollaries to ~ H and C = ~c, and to H and C = b.
