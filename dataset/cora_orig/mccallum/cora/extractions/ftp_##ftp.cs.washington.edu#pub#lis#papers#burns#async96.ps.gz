Title: General Conditions for the Decomposition of State Holding Elements

Abstract: A fundamental problem in the design of speed-independent asynchronous circuits is the decomposition or splitting up of high-fanin operators into two or more lower-fanin operators. In this paper, we develop general techniques to decided whether a particular decomposition of an arbitrary state-holding or combinational element into two elements with an isolated internal signal is correct. These techniques are extended to determine efficiently all legal decompositions in a parameterized family.

Reference-contexts: The primary motivation for this work is the desire to implement asynchronous circuits generated using the Martin's synthesis methodology [8] in fixed fanin structures such as the Montage field programmable gate array [6]. The work described here differs significantly from previous work on the decomposition problem <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. Instead of performing decompositions into particular structures, for example, AND-OR-C forms, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for an element to be split into two elements with an isolated interconnecting signal.

Using the main result of this paper, we state an alternative decomposition using two state-holding elements.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, z must not fire prematurely, that is, if a change of z 0 is pending, then it must be this change that in turn causes a transition on z and not some other change in the system. The relationship between acknowledgment and stability is discussed in [9] and <ref> [2] </ref>. To check stability, we first determine those states in which z 0 is enabled to fire but has not yet been acknowledge by a change on z.

Again, we perform a Montage style parameterized decomposition, this time with 24 parameter bits. This is a much larger example (32120 reachable states in the original system), i.e., of practical interest, and demonstrates the utility of the proposed techniques.

The current implementation of Montage uses four-input lookup tables, and thus individual RLBs (routing logic blocks) can implement either a three-input state holding element or a four-input combinational element.

The other main contribution is our ability to test the legality of an entire parameterizable family of de compositions simultaneously. <p> Full Montage style decompositions can be performed in time on the same order as the time need to perform the reachability analysis of the original system.
