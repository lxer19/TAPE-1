Abstract: Models of unsupervised correlation-based (Hebbian) synaptic plasticity are typically unstable: either all synapses grow until each reaches the maximum allowed strength, or all synapses decay to zero strength. A common method of avoiding these outcomes is to use a constraint that conserves or limits the total synaptic strength over a cell. We study the dynamical effects of such constraints. Two methods of enforcing a constraint are distinguished, multiplicative and subtractive. For otherwise linear learning rules, multiplicative enforcement of a constraint results in dynamics that converge to the principal eigenvector of the operator determining unconstrained synaptic development. Subtractive enforcement, in contrast, typically leads to a final state in which almost all synaptic strengths reach either the maximum or minimum allowed value. This final state is often dominated by weight configurations other than the principal eigenvector of the unconstrained operator. Multiplicative enforcement yields a "graded" receptive field in which most mutually correlated inputs are represented, whereas subtractive enforcement yields a receptive field that is "sharpened" to a subset of maximally-correlated inputs. If two equivalent input populations (e.g. two eyes) innervate a common target, multiplicative enforcement prevents their segregation (ocular dominance segregation) when the two populations are weakly correlated; whereas subtractive enforcement allows segregation under these circumstances. These results may be used to understand constraints both over output cells and over input cells. A variety of rules that can implement constrained dynamics are discussed.

Reference-contexts: constraint plane to be the hyperplane tangent to the constraint surface at the fixed point, and the constraint vector c to be the vector normal to the constraint plane. c is a left eigenvector of D. 9 The stability of a fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of D <ref> (Hirsch and Smale, 1974) </ref>. If one eigenvalue is positive, the fixed point is unstable; if all eigenvalues are negative, the fixed point is stable. In assessing the outcome of the constrained dynamics, we are only concerned with stability of the fixed point to perturbations within the constraint surface.

Reference-contexts: more closely in systems where sharp receptive fields are achieved, and in visual cortex where ocular dominance columns are likely to develop without requiring anticorrelation between the eyes; while multiplicative constraints might resemble biology more closely in situations like adult cortical plasticity where continually moving and graded representations may occur <ref> (Kaas, 1991) </ref>. We do not advocate that one or the other of these is the biologically correct choice.

This rule does not ensure a selective outcome: as noted in <ref> (Kohonen, 1989, Section 4.3.2) </ref>, it converges either to the principal eigenvector of C = D E , or else to w = 0.

Suppose PCw FP = "0" when synapses w FP i and w FP j are both not saturated. By "0", we mean that each component of the vector is either 0, or else of a sign that would take an already saturated synapse beyond its limiting value.

Thus, the present analysis also applies in these representations, as further described in (Miller and MacKay, 1992, App. <p> The principal eigenvector is typically a zero-sum vector in Hebbian learning when correlations among input activities oscillate in sign as a function of input separation <ref> (Miller, 1990a) </ref>. Such oscillations lead to a principal eigenvector in which weights oscillate in sign, and sum approximately to zero; such a vector is approximately perpendicular to the constraint vector (1; 1; : : : ; 1) T . <p> Thus, S1 constraints lead to linear dynamics driven by PCP rather than by C. These dynamics have been characterized in <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990a, Appendices B and E) </ref>. To understand them, consider first the eigenvectors of PCP. These are of two types: 1.

He explored Hebbian dynamics under S1 constraints with a Gaussian correlation function, using w min = w max and a spatially Gaussian distribution of inputs. Then, as analyzed in <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990a,b) </ref>, the leading eigenvector of C is an all-positive eigenvector, and the zero-sum vector derived from this is a center-surround vector. The leading zero-sum eigenvectors of C, and leading eigenvectors of the constrained operator PCP, are two vectors that are bilobed, half positive and half negative. <p> two input layers, the eigenvectors of the unconstrained equation can be divided into sum eigenvectors, 13 w S = e S a , w D = 0, with eigenvalues S a ; and difference eigenvectors, w D = e D a , w S = 0, with eigenvalues D a <ref> (Miller, 1990a) </ref>. Now an additional critical distinction emerges between subtractive and multiplicative con straints. A type 1 constraint conserves the total synaptic strength P i . Patterns of w D have zero total synaptic strength, i.e. are zero-sum vectors. <p> Therefore, w D grows freely under an S1 constraint, whereas under a multiplicative constraint growth of w D is suppressed unless a difference eigenvector is the principal eigenvector of the unconstrained development. In models of ocular dominance segregation, the principal eigenvector is typically determined as follows <ref> (Miller, 1990a) </ref>. Let S max and D max be the largest sum and difference eigenvalues respec tively. If there are positive correlations between the activities of the two eyes, then S max &gt; D If there are no between-eye correlations, then S max = D max . <p> First, in the absence of constraints, the RFs of the dominant patterns are primarily determined by a particular input correlation function, and the PFs of the dominant patterns are similarly determined by the output layer lateral interaction function <ref> (Miller, 1990a) </ref>. If the correlations are all positive, the RFs have a single sign; if correlations oscillate in sign with input separation, the RFs oscillate in sign with a similar wavelength. <p> When jk 2 j is large, this term enforces the constraint n w = k 1 (Linsker, 1986) and is equivalent to an S1 constraint <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990a, Appendix E) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Again, an increase in w max or decrease in w tot leads to sharpening of the positive part of the receptive field under subtractive constraints (column 4). Finally, consider ocular dominance segregation <ref> (Miller et al., 1989) </ref> (Fig. 1C). We suppose the output cell receives two equivalent sets of inputs: left-eye inputs and right-eye inputs. A Gaussian correlation function C describes correlations within each eye as before, while between the two eyes there is zero correlation; and w min = 0. <p> For example, in the visual system, inputs serving the left eye and right eye each project to the visual cortex, in an initially completely overlapping manner <ref> (Miller et al., 1989) </ref>. Similarly, ON-center and OFF-center cells make initially equivalent projections to visual cortex (Miller, 1992). Let w 1 , w 2 respectively be the synaptic weight vector from each input projection. <p> If these correlations are negative, then D max . Thus, under a multiplicative constraint, w D cannot grow, and ocular dominance segregation cannot occur, unless the two eyes are negatively correlated 7 <ref> (Miller et al., 1989) </ref>. Such anticorre-lations could be produced by intralaminar inhibition within the LGN. However, it seems unlikely that ocular dominance segregation depends on anticorrelations, since ocular dominance develops in the presence of vision in some animals, and vision should partially correlate the two eyes. <p> Subtractive input constraints thus determine the width of a left-eye plus a right-eye ocular dominance column to be an arbor diameter when the unconstrained dynamics would lead to larger columns, but have little effect on ocular dominance segregation otherwise <ref> (Miller et al., 1989) </ref>. 4 How Can Constraints Be Implemented? 4.1 Learning rules that converge to constrained dynamics The formulations in Eqs. 3-5 confine the dynamics to the constraint surface that contains the initial weight vector.

Reference-contexts: Such sharpening under subtractive constraints can create a precise match between two spatial maps, for example maps of auditory and of visual space, despite spatially broad correlations between the two maps <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1992) </ref>. If w min is decreased below zero, center-surround receptive fields can result under subtractive constraints (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the results under multiplicative constraints or unconstrained dynamics are unaltered by this change. <p> For example, in the visual system, inputs serving the left eye and right eye each project to the visual cortex, in an initially completely overlapping manner (Miller et al., 1989). Similarly, ON-center and OFF-center cells make initially equivalent projections to visual cortex <ref> (Miller, 1992) </ref>. Let w 1 , w 2 respectively be the synaptic weight vector from each input projection. Define the sum, w S j w 1 + w 2 , and the difference, w D j w 1 w 2 . <p> Both types of coupling may take the mathematical form of an output layer "lateral interaction function" (Miller, 1990b; Miller et al., 1989). Formulation of constraints in the case of a full layer is discussed in <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1992, Appendix C) </ref>. We have not studied constraints over a full layer in detail. However, the following heuristics, based on the single cell studies of section 2, appear to be compatible with the studies cited in the previous paragraph and with unpublished observations.

Reference-contexts: The instability of subtractive constraints depends on the unconstrained operator having at least two positive eigenvalues, which is typical for Hebbian learning. An interesting alternative is anti-Hebbian learning <ref> (Mitchison, 1991) </ref>: in this case, all unconstrained eigenvalues are reversed in sign from the Hebbian case, so typically no eigenvalue is positive. <p> <ref> (Mitchison, 1991) </ref>: in this case, all unconstrained eigenvalues are reversed in sign from the Hebbian case, so typically no eigenvalue is positive. Our analysis applies to this case also: multiplicatively constrained dynamics flow to the principal eigenvector, which is the vector that would have the smallest eigenvalue under Hebbian dynamics (Mitchison, 1991); while subtractively constrained dynamics flow to the fixed point, which is stable. Multiplicative and subtractive constraints represent two fundamentally different methods of controlling the size of the weight vector. Multiplication equally rescales all weight patterns, while subtraction directly acts on only a single weight pattern.
