Abstract: The goal of image understanding by computer is to identify objects in visual images and (if necessary) to determine their location and orientation. Objects are identified by comparing data extracted from images to an a priori description of the object or object class in memory. It is a generally accepted premise that, in many domains, the timely and appropriate use of knowledge can substantially reduce the complexity of matching image data to object descriptions. Because of the variety and scope of knowledge relevant to different object classes, contexts and viewing conditions, blackboard architectures are well suited to the task of selecting and applying the relevant knowledge to each situation as it is encountered. This paper reviews ten years of work on the UMass VISIONS system ([12, 13]) and its blackboard-based high-level component, the schema system ([6, 7]). The schema system could interpret complex natural scenes when given carefully crafted knowledge bases describing the domain, but its application in practice was limited by the problem of model (knowledge base) acquisition. Experience with the schema system convinced us that learning techniques must be embedded in vision systems of the future to reduce or eliminate the knowledge engineering aspects of system construction.

Reference-contexts: PSEIKI ([1]) combined the blackboard programming model with the Shafer-Dempster theory of evidence to recognize 2D objects. Some of the difficulties and advantages of using 2 blackboards for vision are discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 Summary of the VISIONS Schema System From the beginning, the goals of the schema system were different from those motivating the designs of most other computer vision systems. First, the schema system was designed to recognize both man-made and natural objects in outdoor scenes.

Reference-contexts: Each of these is discussed very briefly in the following sections; more detail may be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.1.1 The Schema Hierarchy The schema system partitions both knowledge and computation in terms of natural object classes for a given domain. <p> While this information is crucially important within the schema instance for making dynamic control decisions, it is of little importance to other schema instances. If the strategies associated with multiple concurrent schema instances continually dump this 6 system (from <ref> [7] </ref>). 7 information to the global blackboard and then read it back again, the blackboard quickly be-comes a computational bottleneck. The local blackboards alleviate this problem by reducing the message traffic on the global blackboard. <p> Although this 8 method of evidence representation and accumulation may lack considerably from a theoreti-cal point of view, it has worked surprisingly well in interpretation experiments on images of New England house and road scenes <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.2 Knowledge Engineering in the Schema System Schemas are assembled by specifying (1) the appropriate set of knowledge sources to be used, (2) a set of strategies which conditionally sequence their application, and (3) a function to translate internal evidence into a confidence in the global hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: Instead of making the knowledge base easier to program, we have decided to take the programmer out of the loop. Our goal is a knowledge-directed vision system that learns its own interpretation strategies. As a first step in this direction we have designed the Schema Learning System (SLS; <ref> [8] </ref>), as shown in Figure 3. SLS's task is to learn interpretation strategies for object classes. In particular, it learns object recognition strategies that minimize the cost of achieving a recognition goal, specified by a level of representation and accuracy parameters.

Reference-contexts: In general, we will describe SLS as if all KSs took just one argument in order to keep the description brief; see <ref> [9] </ref> for a more complete description. 15 The purpose of exploration is twofold. First, it generates examples of how correct hypotheses (i.e. hypotheses that match the user's solutions) are generated from images, for use by the learning from examples algorithm. Second, it provides a basis for characterizing KSs.

Reference-contexts: A heuristic scheduler associated with the central blackboard decides which knowledge source should be executed on each cycle, invoking only those KSs which involve promising hypotheses. Reviews of blackboard technology can be found in [20] and <ref> [10] </ref>. Faced with many of the same problems that arise during speech recognition, some vision researchers adopted the blackboard model. The VISIONS system used a blackboard model to recognize common 2D views of 3D objects ([12]).

Reference-contexts: When sufficient evidence is accumulated for a hypothesis, a GKS transforms it to another level of abstraction, where the process repeats itself. As defined in the field of operations research (e.g. <ref> [14] </ref>, Chapter 15), decision trees are a form of state-space representation composed of alternating choice states and chance states. When searching for a path from the start state to a goal state, an agent at a choice state is allowed to choose which chance state to go to next.

Reference-contexts: A heuristic scheduler associated with the central blackboard decides which knowledge source should be executed on each cycle, invoking only those KSs which involve promising hypotheses. Reviews of blackboard technology can be found in <ref> [20] </ref> and [10]. Faced with many of the same problems that arise during speech recognition, some vision researchers adopted the blackboard model. The VISIONS system used a blackboard model to recognize common 2D views of 3D objects ([12]). <p> Schemas communicate with each other by writing to and reading from the blackboard, dynamically exchanging information about their respective hypotheses. Although the blackboard is divided into sections corresponding to the object classes (rather than processing levels, as in other systems <ref> [20] </ref>), schemas may read and write freely over the entire blackboard. The division into sections gives some assurance that a schema will not have to search through a large number of irrelevant messages.
