Abstract: We present a method for self-focusing through inhomogeneous media, which uses the inverse scattering problem to estimate the array Green's function. In particular, the distorted Born iterative method is used to solve the nonlinear inverse scattering problem for a region of interest. Optimal single and multiple focus field patterns can be synthesized by using the estimated Green's function in the pseu-doinverse pattern synthesis method. This approach is non-invasive. It simply requires measurements of the scattered field outside the region of interest. It can be used for high resolution imaging and enhanced therapeutic effects through inhomogeneous media without making any assumptions on the shape, size, or location of the inhomogeneity. We outline this technique, and show numerical simulations using a circular array.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm terminates when G falls below a preset threshold parameter, j, where G is a normalized distance measure between the current and previous estimate of the Green's function. 4 Pattern Synthesis Method Following the theoretical development of the PI pattern synthesis method <ref> [2] </ref>, we write the modulated (or focused) incident field, in matrix form, as OE i = G T where the N fi 1 vector, OE f i , contains samples of the focused incident field, G 0 is the M fi N homogeneous Green's function matrix, and u is a M <p> The n fi 1 control pattern vector, p, can be set to [1 1] T as we do in the simulations presented in Section 5. The excitation weight satisfying the control pattern vector can be computed using the pseudoinverse of H <ref> [2] </ref>, ^u = H flT H H flT p: (8) where the () flT denotes the conjugate transpose, and the op erator H y = H flT HH flT (9) is the pseudoinverse of H .
