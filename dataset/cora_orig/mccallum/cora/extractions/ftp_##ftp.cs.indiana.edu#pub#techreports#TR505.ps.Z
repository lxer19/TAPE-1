Reference-contexts: Rubber Sheet [SSTR93] is based on an algorithm which uses vector-pair (morphing) techniques to generate transformations. It allows for constrained transformations, areas of linear magnification, and multiple transformations. Pad++ <ref> [BH94b] </ref> is primarily a pan-and-zoom system, although there is also some application of nonlinear magnification through the use of multi-scale representations of sets of documents. Example applications of this include directory browsing and WWW navigation.

Reference-contexts: This is but one simple example of how LOD rendering can be incorporated into nonlinearly magnified spaces, many other approaches are possible; for example the Pad++ <ref> [BHP + 96] </ref> WWW navigation system uses page thumbnails with a LOD function so that the node at the focus of the transformation becomes an actual web page which the user can interact with (follow links, etc).

Reference-contexts: For example, a user viewing textual data would prefer to see the letters at the area of maximal magnification without the distortions presented by nonlinear transformations. This is relevant when texture mapping <ref> [BN76] </ref> is used to fit arbitrary images (often containing text) to the transformed grid [KR96b]. As the grid points are transformed, the image is transformed along with them. <p> Two examples of transformations at the image level are magnification of digital images (gif, jpeg, etc.), and direct magnification of the computer screen (the contents of the screen buffer). Given a spatial nonlinear magnification system, it is a relatively straightforward task to use texture-mapping techniques <ref> [BN76] </ref> to map such images onto the transformed spatial coordinates. As 4. Application of Nonlinear Magnification 118 we magnify the image, we create space between the pixels (and also compress multiple pixels into a single pixel at regions of demagnification).

Fracchia, </author> <title> 3D pliable surfaces: For the effective presentation of visual information, </title> <booktitle> Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, </booktitle> <year> 1995, </year> <pages> pp. 217-226. </pages>
Reference-contexts: The simplicity of extension to higher dimensions distinguishes these techniques from many other nonlinear magnification systems which rely on perspective projections of 3D surfaces to achieve the magnification affect (such as Perspective Wall [MRC91], Document 2. Transformation-Based Magnification 28 Lens [RM93], 3D Pliable Surfaces <ref> [CCF95a] </ref> and Perspective Tunnel [MK97]). These perspective-based systems are view dependent; they rely on a physical viewing model in 3D space to create magnifications of 2D data. While perspective-based systems can take advantage of accelerated graphics hardware, a dimension is a terrible thing to waste. <p> This produces a partitioning of the domain space similar to Voronoi diagrams from computational geometry, so that each transformation has its own "domain of influence". The visual result of this method is similar to that produced by the vector blending method in <ref> [CCF95a] </ref>, except that with this system the boundaries between transformations are independent of the degree of magnification, and each region can be magnified or de-magnified without affecting the partitioning of the space. The pipeline configuration for partitioned transformations is shown in Figure 2.14. <p> a further example of how these techniques can be used to determine the implicit magnification generated by existing systems, we use the example of Perspective Wall [MRC91], which is representative of the class of nonlinear magnification systems that are based on a perspective projection of 3D surfaces (other examples include <ref> [RM93, CCF95a, MK97] </ref>). By sampling a perspective wall transformation function with a regular grid, we obtain a transformation grid which is used to generate the associated magnification mesh (see Figure 3.5). <p> We refer to systems which rely on transformation functions to produce nonlinear magnification as transformation-based systems. Another class of systems use a physical viewing model and perspective projections to produce nonlinear magnification effects <ref> [MRC91, RM93, CCF95a, MK97] </ref>. In general such perspective-based systems have an irregular correspondence between elevation and magnification, and require careful attention to the orthogonality of surface normals to the view vector, thus adding 3. Magnification-Based Magnification 100 additional degrees of complexity to the magnification specification task. <p> These problems are compounded further for 2D, and issues of converting magnifications to transformations (and vice-versa) are not addressed in this work. The pliable surfaces described in 3DPS <ref> [CCF95a] </ref> may appear to be similar to nonlinear magnification fields, however closer inspection reveals that the two systems have fundamental differences. <p> Document Lens [RM93] addresses some of the shortcomings of Perspective Wall, and makes better use of available screen space. 2D information is mapped onto truncated 3D pyramid; the pyramid is the viewed in perspective from above to create the nonlinear magnification effect. 3D Pliable Surfaces <ref> [CCF95a] </ref> uses perspective projections of suitably constructed meshes to achieve the effect of 2D nonlinear magnification. The mesh is composed of "hills and valleys", with elevation being inconsistently proportional to magnification. In order to avoid occlusion, the hills are slightly tilted towards the view point, although some combinations of 5. <p> Sheet [SSTR93] ffi * ffi ffi ffi 500 Focus+Context [LRP95] ffi 1; 000 3D Hyperbolic [MB95] ffi 20; 000 Text Viewer [GGC96a] ffi * ffi * ?

Reference-contexts: In particular, the problem of occlusion arises, and areas of magnification may be blocked from view. The occlusion problem is inherent to 3D visualizations in general, and there are many different techniques for dealing with it. Such techniques include transparency, clipping planes and recent work on distortion-oriented techniques <ref> [CCF96a] </ref>. There are some applications however where occlusion does not present as much of a problem. One example of this involves visualization of high-dimensional clusters. Typically the data in these applications is composed of tight clusters of data in a sparse information space. <p> For the text viewer, each user is allowed some control of the degree and shape of the magnification. Magnification of the text is simulated by changing the font size. Distortion Viewing for 3D Data <ref> [CCF96a] </ref> uses gaussian-sine displacements to build tunnels through 3D data to the region of interest. Although these tunnels are not magnification as we have defined it, they can be used in conjunction with simple unbounded radial and orthogonal 3D transformations.

Reference-contexts: Texture mapping of this sort has been used extensively for mapping complete document images onto physical surfaces for perspective-based magnification [MRC91, RM93]. Using nonlinear magnification within images was first described in [KR96b], and subsequently used in <ref> [CCF96b] </ref>. Both of these systems use foci-based approaches to magnification; much more sophisticated image magnification effects are possible using the magnification brushing techniques described in Section 3.5.3. Several examples of image magnification have already been shown in earlier chapters (see Figures 1.2 2.9 3.30 3.31).

Reference-contexts: However the task becomes more difficult when complex transformations with multiple foci and/or constrained domains are used; simple Euclidean distance is no longer effective as a measure on which to base object size in such cases. A recent article <ref> [CCF97] </ref> extols the benefits of separating magnification and transformation functions, however the authors do not address the issue of how to ensure that these functions are reasonably synchronized.

Reference-contexts: The 2. Transformation-Based Magnification 53 core concepts of this system have been adopted by other researchers as a basis for the design of similar systems for nonlinear magnification, particularly in the application of collaborative geographic information system browsers <ref> [CPC97] </ref>. The transformation-based approach to nonlinear magnification is by far the most prevalent among the systems described in the literature. Although these systems encompass a high degree of variation in the methods used, they all have two characteristics in common. <p> Distortion Viewing for 3D Data [CCF96a] uses gaussian-sine displacements to build tunnels through 3D data to the region of interest.

Reference-contexts: A clear area for further refinement of this algorithm would be to incorporate well-established multi-level computation techniques such as those surveyed in <ref> [Dou96] </ref> to obtain greater performance. Figure 3.22 shows the effect of changing stride on convergence times for an unconstrained radial transformation while varying the smoothing filter to change the error volume. Not unexpectedly, mesh resolution is also a significant factor in the performance 3. Magnification-Based Magnification 94 of our algorithm.

Reference-contexts: One of the goals of this research has been to provide a more rigorous treatment of some of the issues which they raise, in particular the non-trivial magnification to transformation conversion for more than one dimension. Space-scale diagrams <ref> [FB95] </ref> are well suited for dealing with typical pan-and-zoom systems; however such systems do not share basic properties of nonlinear magnification systems, such as preserving a view of the global context.

Reference-contexts: Some of these will be mentioned here, and Chapter 5 will contain a fuller description of these and other systems. In this chapter we will describe the construction of transformation-based magnification effects via a pipeline paradigm, similar to the rendering pipelines commonly encountered in the computer graphics literature <ref> [FvDFH90] </ref>. This pipeline provides a modular RISC-type approach to nonlinear magnification, reducing complex transformations into their constituent components, which can be easily manipulated and combined. By applying this transformation pipeline to a regular grid of points covering the source domain, we obtain a transformation grid T .

Reference-contexts: Although the solution is numerically correct (the window size has been enlarged to encompass the new boundaries), the result suffers from all of the previously mentioned shortcomings and does not present an effective visualization. The second method is based on histogram equalization techniques <ref> [GW93] </ref>. For the case of 1D magnification to transformation conversion, it is a simple matter to use histogram equalization to translate the magnification values into suitable transformations.

This application is described in greater detail in Section 4.1.2.2. 2. <p> Figure 4.2 shows one simple implementation of such a text browser, where the spacing between lines of text is adjusted with nonlinear magnification (the size of the text characters themselves remains constant).

Reference-contexts: More recent work has seen application of nonlinear magnification to the visualization of text files in a groupware environment [GGC96b]. This work is particularly notable in that it provides some controls for directly specifying the 1D magnification function. 4.1.2.3 Graph Visualization HyperLINK.

Reference-contexts: For example, a user viewing textual data would prefer to see the letters at the area of maximal magnification without the distortions presented by nonlinear transformations. This is relevant when texture mapping [BN76] is used to fit arbitrary images (often containing text) to the transformed grid <ref> [KR96b] </ref>. As the grid points are transformed, the image is transformed along with them. <p> Texture mapping of this sort has been used extensively for mapping complete document images onto physical surfaces for perspective-based magnification [MRC91, RM93]. Using nonlinear magnification within images was first described in <ref> [KR96b] </ref>, and subsequently used in [CCF96b]. Both of these systems use foci-based approaches to magnification; much more sophisticated image magnification effects are possible using the magnification brushing techniques described in Section 3.5.3. Several examples of image magnification have already been shown in earlier chapters (see Figures 1.2 2.9 3.30 3.31).

Reference-contexts: Chapter 5 will provide pointers to related work, and Chapter 6 will summarize the conclusions. 2 Transformation-Based Magnification The distinction between transformation functions and magnification functions (in the context of nonlinear magnification) was originally defined by Leung and Apperley in [LA94] and expanded upon in <ref> [KR96d] </ref>. The transformation function is the function that is used to perform the actual transformations, whereas the magnification function (which is the derivative of the transformation function) indicates the actual degree of magnification implicit in the transformation function. <p> By applying this transformation pipeline to a regular grid of points covering the source domain, we obtain a transformation grid T . Viewing T shows the effects of the transformation pipeline across the entire source domain. Much of the functionality described in this chapter was originally reported in <ref> [KR96d] </ref>, although without describing the pipeline paradigm for integrating the constituent components. 2.1 Single Transformations We begin our construction of the full transformation pipeline by first creating a pipeline for single transformations (i.e. only one center of magnification). <p> Another possibility is a modified logistic function (f (x; fi) = 2:0 (1:0+e 2fix ) 1:0) which is visually very similar to tanh, but is computationally less expensive on many machines <ref> [KR96d] </ref>. It will also be shown in section 2.5.1 that piecewise linear functions can be used to provide a reasonable approximation to these 1D transformation functions. Figure 2.3 shows a comparison of the fisheye, tanh and logistic transformation functions. Throughout the rest of 2. <p> This is in contrast to perspective based systems such as perspective wall [MRC91], where elevation and magnification do not correspond directly, but are also dependent on viewing parameters. and linear magnification; the transformation grid was generated using the techniques 3. Magnification-Based Magnification 66 described in <ref> [KR96d] </ref>. <p> Although these tunnels are not magnification as we have defined it, they can be used in conjunction with simple unbounded radial and orthogonal 3D transformations. Collaborative GIS Browsers [CPC97] uses a technique based on the techniques in <ref> [KR96d] </ref> and Chapter 2 to provide fisheye views of GIS systems in a groupware environment. 5.2 Perspective-Based Systems Another approach for producing nonlinear magnification of 2D surfaces involves mapping those surfaces onto a 3D structure, and then using a perspective projection of that structure to create the effect of nonlinear magnification. <p> The direct scalar representation creates no multi-dimensional dependencies: z = m (x; y) (5.3) The work described in Chapter 3 represents the only fully magnification-based system to date for spatial nonlinear magnification. Other systems allowing simple manipulation of 1D magnification functions are described in <ref> [GGC96a, KR96d] </ref>. 5.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 5 will provide pointers to related work, and Chapter 6 will summarize the conclusions. 2 Transformation-Based Magnification The distinction between transformation functions and magnification functions (in the context of nonlinear magnification) was originally defined by Leung and Apperley in <ref> [LA94] </ref> and expanded upon in [KR96d]. The transformation function is the function that is used to perform the actual transformations, whereas the magnification function (which is the derivative of the transformation function) indicates the actual degree of magnification implicit in the transformation function. <p> Magnification-Based Magnification 57 can be layered on top of these low level magnification fields. 3.1 Magnification Fields When describing nonlinear magnification systems, it is useful to distinguish between magnification and transformation functions, as first described for the one-dimensional case in <ref> [LA94] </ref>. The transformation function directly stretches and compresses the space, while the magnification function (which is the derivative of the transformation function) represents the magnification values which are implicit in the transformation function. This distinction is central to the work described in this chapter. <p> Before exploring the mathematics for determining the local 2D magnification, it is illustrative to look at the simple 1D case, where the the relationship between transformation and magnification functions was first established by Leung and Apperley 3. Magnification-Based Magnification 58 in <ref> [LA94] </ref>. In particular, they identify magnification as the derivative of the transformation function. <p> Developing applications which are able to use this new functionality to advantage represents a major avenue for future research. 3.6 Related Work Leung and Apperley <ref> [LA94] </ref> provide a comprehensive review and taxonomy of major nonlinear magnification systems. Through the introduction of the distinct concepts of transformation and magnification functions, they describe the basic one dimensional properties of nonlinear magnification systems in a systematic fashion. <p> The authors of that work have also redefined the mathematical definition of "magnification function" as originally established in <ref> [LA94] </ref> into a less quantifiable conceptual "distinction" relating to node-size for graph visualization. The implicit magnification fields which we developed in Chapter 3 are very well suited for this task when complex transformations are involved. <p> Many of the systems mentioned here have already been discussed in greater detail in relevant sections of the preceeding chapters. A good overview of the research up to 1994 can be found in A Review and Taxonomy of Distortion-Oriented Presentation Techniques <ref> [LA94] </ref>. In addition, Noik [Noi94b] has produced a substantial categorization of many systems, especially of those systems specialized for graph visualization.

Similar terminology is scattered through much of the literature since that time [BW96a, Hol97]. Our definition of the problem has significant differences from these approaches. Traditional focus+context techniques are designed to create "focus" by enlarging spaces, and reduced "context" by compressing the surrounding spaces. <p> Pad++ [BH94b] is primarily a pan-and-zoom system, although there is also some application of nonlinear magnification through the use of multi-scale representations of sets of documents.

Reference-contexts: The simplicity of extension to higher dimensions distinguishes these techniques from many other nonlinear magnification systems which rely on perspective projections of 3D surfaces to achieve the magnification affect (such as Perspective Wall [MRC91], Document 2.

These perspective-based systems are view dependent; they rely on a physical viewing model in 3D space to create magnifications of 2D data. While perspective-based systems can take advantage of accelerated graphics hardware, a dimension is a terrible thing to waste. <p> a further example of how these techniques can be used to determine the implicit magnification generated by existing systems, we use the example of Perspective Wall [MRC91], which is representative of the class of nonlinear magnification systems that are based on a perspective projection of 3D surfaces (other examples include <ref> [RM93, CCF95a, MK97] </ref>). By sampling a perspective wall transformation function with a regular grid, we obtain a transformation grid which is used to generate the associated magnification mesh (see Figure 3.5). <p> We refer to systems which rely on transformation functions to produce nonlinear magnification as transformation-based systems. Another class of systems use a physical viewing model and perspective projections to produce nonlinear magnification effects <ref> [MRC91, RM93, CCF95a, MK97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It seems quite possible that nonlinear magnification transformations within the planar space of the image coordinates can be used to similarly enhance perception. An example of a more subtle enhancement is shown in Figure 3.31, which shows how an image from NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission <ref> [Nat97] </ref> can be enhanced to emphasize the presence and features of the rock referred to as "Barnacle Bill" by the mission specialists. Certainly there is a potential for these magnification techniques to produce misleading visualizations, however the same can also be said for many of the other enhancement techniques.

Reference-contexts: Many of the systems mentioned here have already been discussed in greater detail in relevant sections of the preceeding chapters. A good overview of the research up to 1994 can be found in A Review and Taxonomy of Distortion-Oriented Presentation Techniques [LA94]. In addition, Noik <ref> [Noi94b] </ref> has produced a substantial categorization of many systems, especially of those systems specialized for graph visualization. It is worth noting that some of the classification criteria in these overviews do not account very well for the new features of the magnification-based system which we developed in Chapter 3.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4.15 shows an example of this operation. This differs from single image magnification in that we are now dynamically incorporating additional detail within the context provided by our nonlinear magnification transformation. PARC Map Server <ref> [PAR93] </ref>. Two views of the California Bay Area are provided, with one map showing more detail (roads, railway tracks etc.) than the other. As the simple view is magnified, additional detail is pulled in from the detailed view.

Reference-contexts: The simplicity of extension to higher dimensions distinguishes these techniques from many other nonlinear magnification systems which rely on perspective projections of 3D surfaces to achieve the magnification affect (such as Perspective Wall [MRC91], Document 2. Transformation-Based Magnification 28 Lens <ref> [RM93] </ref>, 3D Pliable Surfaces [CCF95a] and Perspective Tunnel [MK97]). These perspective-based systems are view dependent; they rely on a physical viewing model in 3D space to create magnifications of 2D data. While perspective-based systems can take advantage of accelerated graphics hardware, a dimension is a terrible thing to waste. <p> a further example of how these techniques can be used to determine the implicit magnification generated by existing systems, we use the example of Perspective Wall [MRC91], which is representative of the class of nonlinear magnification systems that are based on a perspective projection of 3D surfaces (other examples include <ref> [RM93, CCF95a, MK97] </ref>). By sampling a perspective wall transformation function with a regular grid, we obtain a transformation grid which is used to generate the associated magnification mesh (see Figure 3.5). <p> We refer to systems which rely on transformation functions to produce nonlinear magnification as transformation-based systems. Another class of systems use a physical viewing model and perspective projections to produce nonlinear magnification effects <ref> [MRC91, RM93, CCF95a, MK97] </ref>. In general such perspective-based systems have an irregular correspondence between elevation and magnification, and require careful attention to the orthogonality of surface normals to the view vector, thus adding 3. Magnification-Based Magnification 100 additional degrees of complexity to the magnification specification task. <p> This creates the effect of a continuous image, although the underlying data are actually only discrete samples of a continuous image. Texture mapping of this sort has been used extensively for mapping complete document images onto physical surfaces for perspective-based magnification <ref> [MRC91, RM93] </ref>. Using nonlinear magnification within images was first described in [KR96b], and subsequently used in [CCF96b]. Both of these systems use foci-based approaches to magnification; much more sophisticated image magnification effects are possible using the magnification brushing techniques described in Section 3.5.3. <p> Application of Nonlinear Magnification 136 different levels: the underlying space, between objects, and within individual objects. Prominent examples of this type of embedded object are found in the Perspective Wall [MRC91] and the Document Lens <ref> [RM93] </ref>. Figure 4.11 shows an example of using embedded objects for our interactive atlas. There are a number of problems with embedded objects. <p> The center panel is perpendicular to the line of sight, and the two adjoining panels slope away from the viewer. Perspective projections of this wall then provide a single area of linear magnification with two areas of reduced resolution to either side. Document Lens <ref> [RM93] </ref> addresses some of the shortcomings of Perspective Wall, and makes better use of available screen space. 2D information is mapped onto truncated 3D pyramid; the pyramid is the viewed in perspective from above to create the nonlinear magnification effect. 3D Pliable Surfaces [CCF95a] uses perspective projections of suitably constructed meshes <p> Fisheye [SB94] ffi 150 Rubber Sheet [SSTR93] ffi * ffi ffi ffi 500 Focus+Context [LRP95] ffi 1; 000 3D Hyperbolic [MB95] ffi 20; 000 Text Viewer [GGC96a] ffi * ffi * ?
