Title: Bisimulation for probabilistic transition systems: a coalgebraic approach  
Author: E.P. de Vink J.J.M.M. Rutten 
Keyword: Bisimulation, probabilistic transition systems, coalgebras, ultrametric spaces, Borel measures, final coalgebra  
Abstract: The notion of bisimulation as proposed by Larsen and Skou for discrete probabilistic transition systems is shown to coincide with a coalgebraic definition in the sense of Aczel and Mendler in terms of a set functor, which associates to a set its collection of simple probability distributions. This coalgebraic formulation makes it possible to generalize the concepts of discrete probabilistic transition system and probabilistic bisimulation to a continuous setting involving Borel probability measures. A functor M 1 is introduced that yields for a metric space its collection of Borel probability measures. Under reasonable conditions, this functor exactly captures generalized probabilistic bisimilarity. Application of the final coalgebra paradigm to M 1 then yields an internally fully abstract semantical domain with respect to probabilistic bisimulation, which is therefore well-suited for the interpretation of probabilistic specification and stochastic programming concepts.

Reference-contexts: a; s 0 ) 2 ! iff (a; s 0 ) 2 ff (s), is clearly a transition system. (See [Rut96] for more details.) One of the advantages of the coalgebraic view on transition systems is the existence of a general definition of F -bisimulation, for any functor F (cf. <ref> [AM89] </ref>). For instance, applying that definition to the functor L above yields the standard notion of strong bisimulation of [Mil80, Par81]. (Cf. [RT94], see also Section 2). <p> Firstly, one can resort to the rich literature for standard measure theory on metric spaces (see, e.g., [KV84]). Secondly, we can apply the recently developed theory on coalgebraic bisimulation and final coalgebras in the metric setting <ref> [AM89, RT94] </ref>. Notably, we shall see that M 1 is locally contractive, from which it follows that it has a final coalgebra. Because of the coalgebraic definition of bisimulation, we thus obtain an internally fully abstract domain.

Reference-contexts: Here, final means that there exists a unique homomorphism from any coalgebra to the final one.

In turns out that we are only able to show the existence of a final coalgebra when we consider an adaptation of M 1 , say M 0 1 , which delivers Borel probability measures with so-called compact support, i.e., measures that vanish outside a compact set.

The following is proved in <ref> [Bar93] </ref> (see also [Rut96]): Any bounded set functor has a final coalgebra. Any subcoalgebra hsi of an D 0 -coalgebra ff: S ! D 0 (S) is at most countable. Therefore, the set of natural numbers is a bound for D 0 .

Reference-contexts: For the exploration of probabilistic transition systems and stochastic equivalences in the setting of modeling continuous systems, such as real-time or hybrid systems, one usually wants to allow more general probability measures than the more limited discrete probability distributions. The current work of Blute et al. <ref> [BDEP96] </ref> is the single proposal into this direction that we know of. <p> Moreover, exploiting parts of the theory of coalgebras, both for the discrete case and for the continuous case, internally fully abstract domains are constructed. Further investigations of the proposed notion of Borel decomposition should clarify how the latter relates to the use of Polish spaces as in <ref> [BDEP96] </ref>. We expect that the technical result obtained there, on the existence of weak pullbacks, applies also to our setting. Another direction for future research concerns the bisimulation domain that can be constructed with the functor on metric spaces.

Finally, it is expected that the process equivalences and fully abstract domains presented in this paper may be fruitfully applied in the semantical study of dynamical and hybrid systems.

Reference-contexts: D (X) denotes the collection of all simple probability distributions on X. For E X, [E] is short for P x2E (x). This way, a simple probability distribution corresponds to a convex linear combination of Dirac-measures. Metric spaces (See, e.g., the monograph <ref> [BV96] </ref>.) A pair (M; d) with M a nonempty set and d: M 2 ! [0; 1] is called an ultrametric space if, for all x; y; z 2 M : d (x; y) = d (y; x), d (x; y) = 0 , x = y, and d (x; z) <p> As mentioned in the introduction, we prefer the use of ultrametric (cf. <ref> [BV96] </ref>) above order, because of a combination of the following two reasons: (1) the technical advantage of a close relationship between standard measure theory and metric topology, and (2) the availability of a final coalgebra theorem in the metric setting, leading to a fully abstract domain for general probabilistic bisimulation.

We expect that a nonuniform extension of the CSP-style language treated by Seidel [Sei95] can be interpreted in this model.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction For discrete probabilistic transition systems the notion of probabilistic bisimilarity of Larsen and Skou [LS91] is regarded as the basic process equivalence. The definition was given for reactive systems. However, Van Glabbeek, Smolka and Steffen showed, in a systematic study of a process language with probabilistic choice <ref> [GSS95] </ref>, that the usual notion of strong bisimilarity and the probabilistic concepts of reactive, generative and so-called stratified bisimulation constitute a hierarchy of observational congruences. <p> We will show that D-bisimilarity implies probabilistic bisimilarity, and, using the notion of z-closure, that probabilistic bisimulation and totality imply D-bisimilarity. Then it is shown how this leads to the existence of a fully abstract domain. 4 Definition 3.1 <ref> [LS91, GSS95] </ref> A discrete probabilistic transition system is a tuple (Pr; Act; ) where Pr is a nonempty set of processes, Act is a given set of actions, and : Pr fi Act fi Pr !

This shows that Definition 3.1 is a special instance of Definition 3.2 (`modulo' the presence of labels and termination). Next we relate D-bisimulation to the notion of probabilistic bisimulation of Definition 3.2.

Reference-contexts: The presence of `=2' in the definition of F results in (a). (The other constituent functors are locally nonexpansive.) Only for part (b) the assumption of measures having a compact support is necessary. Its proof is non-trivial (cf. <ref> [HV97] </ref>). Finally, part (c) follows from (a), (b), and (a minor variation of) [RT93], Theorem 4.8. Let Q be the final F -coalgebra: Q ~ = Act ! (M 0 1 (Q )=2 + f0g). From Theorem 2.1 and 4.8 we then immediately obtain the following result.

It is however not clear how their notion of probabilistic specification extends to the continuous setting of Section 4. It is straightforward to adapt the above line of reasoning to a functor D 0 given by D 0 = Act ! (D () + f0g).

We shall show that it follows from general coalgebraic considerations <ref> [AR89, Bar93, RT93] </ref> that both our functors D and M 1 have a final coalgebra, which consequently are internally fully abstract with respect to (discrete and continuous) probabilistic bisimulation. Therefore these final coalgebras can be exploited as semantic domains for probabilistic bisimulation (an important direction for future research). <p> two reasons: (1) the technical advantage of a close relationship between standard measure theory and metric topology, and (2) the availability of a final coalgebra theorem in the metric setting, leading to a fully abstract domain for general probabilistic bisimulation. (Point (2) would also apply to the order-theoretic case, see <ref> [RT93] </ref>.) The generalization of the notion of a discrete probabilistic transition system and the associated concept of bisimulation as proposed by Larsen and Skou is as follows. <p> (s) = ff ( 1 (s; t)) and M 1 ( 2 )(fl s;t ) = fi (t) = fi ( 2 (s; t)). 2 In the remainder of this section, we shall again use some general insights from the theory of coalgebras, this time by applying a result from <ref> [AR89, RT93] </ref>. In turns out that we are only able to show the existence of a final coalgebra when we consider an adaptation of M 1 , say M 0 1 , which delivers Borel probability measures with so-called compact support, i.e., measures that vanish outside a compact set. <p> Let M 0 1 (M ) denote the collection of all Borel probability measures of an ultrametric space M . Similarly as for M 1 , the new M 0 1 extends to a functor on UMS. Additionally, to ensure the technical property of local contractivity (see, e.g., <ref> [RT93] </ref>), we put in a scaling functor =2. The functor =2: UMS ! UMS maps a space M to the space with the same underlying set but now with all distances multiplied by a factor 1 2 . This operation is harmless from a semantical point of view. <p> Its proof is non-trivial (cf. [HV97]). Finally, part (c) follows from (a), (b), and (a minor variation of) <ref> [RT93] </ref>, Theorem 4.8. Let Q be the final F -coalgebra: Q ~ = Act ! (M 0 1 (Q )=2 + f0g). From Theorem 2.1 and 4.8 we then immediately obtain the following result.

Reference-contexts: For instance, applying that definition to the functor L above yields the standard notion of strong bisimulation of [Mil80, Par81]. (Cf. <ref> [RT94] </ref>, see also Section 2). In general, the coalgebraic theory gives a generic approach to the definition and description of bisimulation: First define or characterize the transition systems one is interested in as coalgebras of a suitably chosen functor F . <p> Firstly, one can resort to the rich literature for standard measure theory on metric spaces (see, e.g., [KV84]). Secondly, we can apply the recently developed theory on coalgebraic bisimulation and final coalgebras in the metric setting <ref> [AM89, RT94] </ref>. Notably, we shall see that M 1 is locally contractive, from which it follows that it has a final coalgebra. Because of the coalgebraic definition of bisimulation, we thus obtain an internally fully abstract domain.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, any L-coalgebra corresponds to a transition system: If (S; ff) is a coalgebra for L, then (S; A; !), with ! S fi A fi S given by (s; a; s 0 ) 2 ! iff (a; s 0 ) 2 ff (s), is clearly a transition system. (See <ref> [Rut96] </ref> for more details.) One of the advantages of the coalgebraic view on transition systems is the existence of a general definition of F -bisimulation, for any functor F (cf. [AM89]). <p> Then obtain a definition of bisimulation for those systems by applying the categorical definition of F -bisimulation. The coalgebraic approach is applicable to many kinds of transition systems |see <ref> [Rut96] </ref> for many examples| including nondeterministic automata, infinite data structures, and object-based systems [Rei95, Jac96]. In the present paper, this scheme is used to describe discrete and continuous probabilistic transition systems and bisimulations. The functor M 1 assigns to a metric space its collection of Borel probability measures. <p> for V T , E [V ] = t2V E (t). (Please note the different usage of brackets in E [] and F [] yielding subsets of S and T , compared to the notation [], introduced above, yielding a real number, for is simple probability distribution.) Coalgebras (See, e.g., <ref> [Rut96] </ref>.) Let C be either the category of sets and functions, or the category of ultrametric spaces and nonexpansive mappings. (These are the only categories playing a role in this paper.) Let F: C ! C be a functor. <p> t 0 ) () s ! ff s 0 ^ t ! fi t 0 : Then, in a similar style as above, we obtain that R is a L-bisimulation for (S; ff) and (T; fi) with mediating function fl. (More details, and many more examples, can be found in <ref> [Rut96] </ref>.) 2 An F-coalgebra (D; ffi) is called final if there exists for any F -coalgebra (S; ff) a unique homomorphism from (S; ff) to (D; ffi). We have the following result. <p> We have the following result. Theorem 2.1 (Internal full abstractness) For a final F-coalgebra (D; ffi) and x; y 2 D, x = y if and only if x ~ y. The proof is easy, see, e.g., <ref> [Rut96] </ref>, Theorem 9.2. <p> Proof Let a functor F be called bounded if there exists a set V such that for any F -coalgebra S and any s 2 S, the subcoalgebra hsi of S generated by s can be embedded injectively into V . The following is proved in [Bar93] (see also <ref> [Rut96] </ref>): Any bounded set functor has a final coalgebra. Any subcoalgebra hsi of an D 0 -coalgebra ff: S ! D 0 (S) is at most countable. Therefore, the set of natural numbers is a bound for D 0 . <p> Let P be the final D 0 -coalgebra, so P ~ = Act ! (D (P) + f0g): (Note that final coalgebras are always fixed points. See, e.g., <ref> [Rut96] </ref>, Theorem 9.1.) The following is immediate by Theorem 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Once a suitable continuous process language is identified (such as PCCS [GJS90] for the discrete case), the domain Q of Section 4 (or a variation thereof) may serve a promising candidate for its modeling. We expect that a nonuniform extension of the CSP-style language treated by Seidel <ref> [Sei95] </ref> can be interpreted in this model. Also, the relationship with other work of the research group at Oxford, in particular on weakest precondition semantics, can now be studied using the dualities as studied in [Bon96].
