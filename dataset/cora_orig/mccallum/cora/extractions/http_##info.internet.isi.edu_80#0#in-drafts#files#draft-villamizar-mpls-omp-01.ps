Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract MPLS ingress routers may establish one or more explicit paths to a given egress to the MPLS domain. Load can be balanced across a complex topology using MPLS and the technique referred to here as MPLS-OMP (Multiprotocol Label Switching Optimized Multipath). The technique requires the use of a link state interior gateway protocol (IGP) such as OSPF or IS-IS with extensions to the link state protocol to flood loading information. It requires the ingress router be capable of computing a hash with a sufficiently fine level of granularity based on the IP source and destination and selecting a forwarding entry based on the outcome of the hash.

Reference-contexts: The MPLS framework and architecture are defined by [2, 3]. The generic forwarding encapsulation is defined by [7]. MPLS-OMP involves the setup of MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) with strictly routed Explicit Routes (ERLSPs). There are two methods of setting up LSPs, the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) <ref> [11, 1] </ref>, and use of RSVP extensions [6, 5]. Both methods of setting up LSPs support strict (and loose) routed ERLSPs. In an underutilized topology, criteria such as minimum delay dominate routing decisions.
