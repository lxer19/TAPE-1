Abstract: The torus network, whose two-dimensional version is often referred to as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN), has received significant attention in the literature. Analysis of the hop distance properties for this network when its links are bidirectional is straightforward. However, the analysis of this network with unidirectional links is more complex, and the literature only provides the mean hop distance for the unidirectional version when the nodal degree is two. Our contribution in this paper is to provide a closed-form, analytical formula for the average hop distance in a three-dimensional torus network with unidirectional links, and to hypothesize an approximate result for higher dimensions. The importance of this work stems from the fact that the torus is a useful candidate for the construction of an optical network with a multihop virtual topology based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). So far, it has not been possible to conduct fair comparisons between the torus and other multihop topologies with nodal degree greater than two, but our work will now enable such comparisons.

Reference-contexts: Virtual topologies which have a regular interconnection pattern have proven to be particularly useful in building multihop structures, since they simplify routing (processing) at intermediate nodes to a great extent. Some widely-studied multihop networks include Shu*eNet <ref> [1, 8] </ref>, deBruijn graph [19], and the torus [9]. embedding a 4x2 torus. In an optical network, the conventional store-and-forward packet switching techniques result in large packet delays due to the lack of advanced optical buffering technology.

Reference-contexts: Some properties of the bidirectional torus network have been studied in [11].

In this paper, we derive closed-form, analytical results for the average hop distance for a birectional torus with any dimensionality as well as for the three-dimensional, unidirectional torus. <p> Hence, even if the torus does not compare very favourably with other multihop topologies in terms of average hop distance, its favourable routing strategies might make the torus more attractive for future applications in lightwave networks. Optimal routing algorithms in the MSN have been studied extensively in <ref> [2, 13] </ref> while deflection routing strategies in the MSN have been proposed and compared with conventional store-and-forward techniques in [14, 18].

Reference-contexts: WDM is a technique used to divide the tremendous bandwidth of a single strand of fiber (potentially a few tens of terabits per second) into many non-interfering wavelengths (WDM channels) <ref> [3, 15, 16, 17] </ref>. Each of these wavelengths can be operated asynchronously and in parallel at whatever speed one desires, e.g., peak electronic speed of a few gigabits per second. In a multihop WDM network, virtual communication channels are established between node pairs through proper tuning of the nodal transceivers.

Reference-contexts: The MSN was introduced as a two-dimensional, unidirectional torus network designed for packet communications in a local or metropolitan area network [12, 13]. It has been found to possess many desirable properties. A closed-form, analytical solution for the mean hop distance for this network has been determined to be <ref> [6] </ref> H 2 X 1 + X 2 + 1 X 1 X 2 An extension of MSN to higher dimensions without changing the nodal degree is reported in [7]. Some properties of the bidirectional torus network have been studied in [11]. <p> result follows directly from the previous lemma. 3 Average Hop Distance in a Di rected Torus The N-dimensional directed torus is symmetrical, because permuting the number of nodes X j in any dimension j does not change the network topology, and every node views the graph in the same manner <ref> [6] </ref>. Also, we need 0, 2, or 4 extra hops over the distance in the undirected case to reach any node in a directed torus [13]. We now derive the expression for the average hop distance in a three-dimensional, directed torus.

Example two-dimensional and three-dimensional torus networks, each with eight nodes and unidirectional links, are shown in 1 Supported by the National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR-9205755.
