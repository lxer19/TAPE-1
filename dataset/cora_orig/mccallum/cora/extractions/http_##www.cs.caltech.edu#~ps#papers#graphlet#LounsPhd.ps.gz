Reference-contexts: Wavelets are well understood for B-spline curves, and Chui [Chui 92a, Chui 92b] treats the subject exhaustively. For B-spline wavelets, translations and dilations of the B-spline basis functions <ref> [Bartels et al. 87] </ref> are used as scaling functions. These translations and dilations are sufficient to set up the nested sequence of linear spaces V j required for a multiresolution analysis over the 16 infinite real line.

Reference-contexts: Equation 3.3 shows an analogy with B-splines, where the j i (x) are comparable to the B-spline basis functions, and the V j are akin to the control points. As a corollary to Theorem 1, the scaling functions j i are continuous, hence they are also integrable <ref> [Bartle 64] </ref>. We may now establish the refinability of the scaling functions defined in Theorem 1. Theorem 2 The scaling functions j i (x) are refinable.

Reference-contexts: Muraki [Muraki 93] uses wavelets parametrized over IR 3 to approximate volume data in 3D. He finds them useful for efficient approximation of volume data at various levels of detail. Muraki's scaling functions are based on Blinn's blobby model <ref> [Blinn 82] </ref> for algebraic surface modeling. Muraki models volumes that are parametrized over the regular IR 3 grid. Therefore, his method is likely to require a very large number of coefficients to accurately represent a surface, and is unable to explicitly control topological type. 7.1.2 Finkelstein and Salesin.

Reference-contexts: For B-splines, there is rich theory to relate a coarse-level B-spline basis function to a combination of finer-level basis functions. Examples are the Oslo algorithm for knot insertion [Lyche et al. 80], Boehm's knot insertion algorithm <ref> [Boehm 80] </ref>, and blossoming [Ramshaw 87]. Another property that is used to construct wavelets from B-splines is integrability.

Reference-contexts: Wavelets have roots in approximation theory, signal processing, and physics. The formal development of multiresolution analysis as a rigorous theory dates to Mallat in 1989 [Mallat 89], although related pyramidal techniques for image analysis <ref> [Burt & Adelson 83] </ref> precede his work.

Reference-contexts: The construction of subdivision wavelets described herein applies directly to a variety of already existing subdivision schemes. These include piecewise linear subdivision (which produces polyhedra); the schemes of Catmull & Clark <ref> [Catmull & Clark 78, Halstead et al. 93] </ref>, Loop [Loop 87] or Dyn et al. [Dyn et al. 90] (which produce tangent-plane-smooth G 1 subdivision surfaces); and the modifications by Hoppe et al. [Hoppe et al. 94, Hoppe 94] that produce piecewise smooth surfaces with selected discontinuities. <p> Subdivision surfaces are discussed at length throughout the rest of this chapter. The study of subdivision surfaces traces back to 1978, when papers by Doo and Sabin [Doo 78, Doo & Sabin 78] and by Catmull and Clark <ref> [Catmull & Clark 78] </ref> developed subdivision procedures for defining tangent-plane smooth surfaces. Although subdivision 20 procedures are simple to implement, the idea failed at first to catch on because there were no convenient methods of analyzing the surfaces, which are only defined implicitly as the limit of an infinite process. <p> Subdivision schemes can be categorized as primal or dual. A subdivision scheme is primal if the faces of the mesh are refined into subfaces by the refinement procedure. Catmull-Clark subdivision <ref> [Catmull & Clark 78, Halstead et al. 93] </ref> is a primal scheme based on subdivision of quadrilateral faces. <p> These results hold for any uniformly convergent continuous and local primal subdivision scheme, including polyhedral subdivision, the butterfly method [Dyn et al. 90], Loop's method [Loop 87], and Catmull-Clark surfaces <ref> [Catmull & Clark 78] </ref>. The results also hold for piecewise smooth subdivision as described in Hoppe et al. [Hoppe et al. 94, Hoppe 94], and for open surfaces that possess holes or boundary curves.

Reference-contexts: On spherical domains, subdivision wavelets enjoy advantages over spherical harmonics in much the same way that standard wavelets provide advantages over Fourier analysis. 2.2.6 B-Spline Curve and Tensor-Product Wavelets. Wavelets are well understood for B-spline curves, and Chui <ref> [Chui 92a, Chui 92b] </ref> treats the subject exhaustively. For B-spline wavelets, translations and dilations of the B-spline basis functions [Bartels et al. 87] are used as scaling functions. <p> We are now in a position to construct wavelets, that is, a set of functions j (x) = ( j j 2 (x); :::) that span the orthogonal complement space W j (M 0 ). (The elements of j (x) are not mutually orthogonal. Some authors, including Chui <ref> [Chui 92a] </ref>, refer to such functions as pre-wavelets.) It is of significant practical importance that the decomposition and reconstruction filters associated with these wavelets are constructed and applied in linear time. This practical concern drives much of the development in this section. 40 3.3.1 The Construction. <p> In order to apply these operations in linear time, we must build wavelets that are locally supported. Constructing wavelets of local support is a common problem in the wavelet literature and has been handled in various ways. Chui <ref> [Chui 92a] </ref> is able to develop unique locally supported wavelets for B-spline curves. Mallat [Mallat 89] builds wavelets that, in addition to being orthogonal to the scaling functions, are mutually orthogonal. Unlike Chui, Mallat's conditions do not allow the construction of locally supported wavelets.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we will see that such estimation is unnecessary, and that exact integration is still possible for the general case. The approach presented here for computing integrals of wavelets based on their refinement equations is similar to independent work by Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [Dahmen & Micchelli 93] </ref>. Their method, however, is restricted to integration over the uniform (spatially invariant) setting.

Reference-contexts: Impressive "lossy" compression rates for images have been achieved using this type of approximation [DeVore et al. 92]. Two-dimensional wavelets are important for a variety of applications, including image compression. They are generally constructed by forming tensor products of univariate wavelets <ref> [Daubechies 92] </ref>, in much the same way that tensor-product B-spline surfaces are formed by products of univariate B-splines. Unfortunately, tensor-product constructions require the functions to be decomposed be defined on IR 2 or on a periodic version of IR 2 such as the cylinder or torus. <p> Unfortunately, tensor-product constructions require the functions to be decomposed be defined on IR 2 or on a periodic version of IR 2 such as the cylinder or torus. There also exist nontensor-product constructions for wavelets on IR <ref> [Daubechies 92, Jia & Micchelli 91] </ref>, but none of these methods are applicable to functions defined on more general topological surfaces, such as over the sphere. <p> In one respect, this is a generalization of the approach taken by Daubechies <ref> [Daubechies 92] </ref>, whose locally supported orthogonal scaling 27 functions are also defined through a recursive subdivision procedure. Although in general the j+1 (x) are not simple dilates of the j (x), one can nonetheless use them to define a sequence of nested spaces. 3.1.1 Refinable Basis Functions through Subdivision.

Reference-contexts: For many of the functions encountered in practice, a large percentage of the wavelet coefficients are small, meaning that good approximations can be obtained by using only a few of the largest coefficients. Impressive "lossy" compression rates for images have been achieved using this type of approximation <ref> [DeVore et al. 92] </ref>. Two-dimensional wavelets are important for a variety of applications, including image compression.

Mallat [Mal-lat 89] and DeVore et al. <ref> [DeVore et al. 92] </ref>, among others, use wavelet techniques for efficient image compression.

These include piecewise linear subdivision (which produces polyhedra); the schemes of Catmull & Clark [Catmull & Clark 78, Halstead et al. 93], Loop [Loop 87] or Dyn et al. <ref> [Dyn et al. 90] </ref> (which produce tangent-plane-smooth G 1 subdivision surfaces); and the modifications by Hoppe et al. [Hoppe et al. 94, Hoppe 94] that produce piecewise smooth surfaces with selected discontinuities. <p> Polyhedral subdivision converges to the original polyhedron covering M 0 , that is, to a C 0 surface. Other schemes have also been developed that converge to tangent-plane smooth limit surfaces that either approximate or interpolate the vertices of M 0 . The Dyn, Levin and Gregory butterfly scheme <ref> [Dyn et al. 90] </ref> is a subdivision method that converges to a tangent-plane smooth surface. Butterfly subdivision interpolates the vertices of the mesh, and thus, as is shown in Section 3.3.4, is especially practical for the implementation of wavelets on smooth surfaces. <p> If P j and ffff j are sparse, then Q j is sparse. Unfortunately, the analysis filters derived from Equation 3.16 need not be sparse. For interpolating subdivision schemes such as polyhedral subdivision and the G 1 "butterfly" scheme of Dyn et al. <ref> [Dyn et al. 90] </ref>, the situation is much improved. Such interpolating schemes have the property that O j is the identity matrix. <p> Chapter 8 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK In this dissertation, we have established a theoretical basis for applying multiresolu-tion analysis to surfaces of arbitrary topological type.

Reference-contexts: More recently, wavelets have been applied to a wide range of computer graphics problems, including curve modeling <ref> [Finkelstein & Salesin 94] </ref>, image editing [Berman et al. 94], improved global illumination [Schroder et al. 93, Gortler et al. 93, Christensen et al. 94], optimization for surface interpolation [Pentland 92], creating surfaces from contours [Meyers 94a, Meyers 94b], and animation control [Liu et al. 94]. <p> Both coordinates in a pair are weighted when choosing coefficients to add back. We use this technique of independent coordinates to develop wavelet analysis of surfaces. Multiresolution editing of B-spline curves and tensor-product surfaces is presented by Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [Finkelstein & Salesin 94] </ref>. Their implementation is not based on simple translates and dilates, because the scaling functions and wavelets near the ends of the curve must be defined specially. The extension of B-spline wavelets to tensor-product surfaces parametrized over the infinite grid is straighforward. <p> We leave both these practical concerns for future work. Chapter 4 WAVELET COMPRESSION OF SURFACES Multiresolution analysis is widely used for data compression applications. Mallat [Mal-lat 89] and DeVore et al. [DeVore et al. 92], among others, use wavelet techniques for efficient image compression. Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [Finkelstein & Salesin 94] </ref> develop a wavelet-based method for approximating B-spline curves within an L 1 tolerance. Other examples of wavelet-based compression techniques abound [Chui & Shi 92, Lucier 92, Mallat & Hwang 92, Berman et al. 94]. <p> The changes shown in Figure 6.1 (c)-(d) were created by simply modifying a single value in the wavelet representation. It is preferable to make these changes under a more powerful user interface. Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [Finkelstein & Salesin 94] </ref> discuss inter faces that are more appropriate for wavelet editing of curves and surfaces. Chapter 7 COMPARISON TO RELATED WORK In this chapter, we compare subdivision wavelets to other techniques for modeling and polyhedral compression. 7.1 Modeling. 7.1.1 Muraki. <p> Muraki models volumes that are parametrized over the regular IR 3 grid. Therefore, his method is likely to require a very large number of coefficients to accurately represent a surface, and is unable to explicitly control topological type. 7.1.2 Finkelstein and Salesin. Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [Finkelstein & Salesin 94] </ref> develop a wavelet-based method for mul-tiresolution editing of B-spline curves. Using filter bank techniques, a fine-level B-spline curve is decomposed into its approximation at various levels of detail. <p> Using subdivision wavelets, it is possible to approximate BRDFs with wavelets truly parametrized over a hemispherical domain. This can lead to improved computation for radiance distribution. 8.1.2 Multiresolution Editing. The techniques of Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [Finkelstein & Salesin 94] </ref> demonstrate the usefulness of wavelets for editing B-spline curves and tensor-product B-spline surfaces. Their method may be adapted to provide multiresolution editing for surfaces of arbitrary topological type.

Reference-contexts: For example, image or texture data, normal information, and temperature or air pressure information may all be compressed over surfaces of arbitrary topological type through the use of subdivision wavelets. * Multiresolution editing of surfaces. Hierarchical B-splines, as introduced by Forsey and Bartels <ref> [Forsey & Bartels 88] </ref>, provide a powerful mechanism for editing shapes at various levels of detail. However, hierarchical B-splines can only represent a restricted class of surface topologies. Subdivision wavelets provide an alternative to hierarchical B-splines, and are capable of representing tangent-plane smooth mul-tiresolution surfaces of arbitrary topological type. <p> Although their method works well for modeling tensor-product patches, tensor-product representations, unlike subdivision wavelet, are inadequate for modeling arbitrary topological types. 7.1.3 Forsey and Bartels. Hierarchical B-splines are an earlier method for modeling tensor-product B-spline surfaces at multiple resolutions. First developed in 1988 by Forsey and Bartels <ref> [Forsey & Bartels 88] </ref>, hierarchical B-splines establish fundamental paradigms for editing surfaces at multiple levels of detail. The essential idea is to provide finer-level control over selected rectangular regions of a B-spline surface. <p> The examples of Section 6.2 show that subdivision wavelets have the potential for mul-tiresolution editing of surfaces of arbitrary topological type. However, this implementation lacks an acceptable user interface. Following Forsey and Bartels <ref> [Forsey & Bartels 88] </ref> and Finkelstein and Salesin, it may be desirable to represent the surface geometry as a function of the surface normal.

Reference-contexts: As the object gets closer, more detail may be added. This process is known as level-of-detail control. Level of detail has been used in flight simulators for many years [Newhard & Nicol 84]. More recently, Funkhouser and Sequin <ref> [Funkhouser & Sequin 93] </ref> use level-of-detail control for real-time walkthroughs through architectural models. They use simplified models for objects that are distant, and detailed models for close-up views. However, their progression of models at various levels of detail is not automatically generated from a single detailed representation.

Reference-contexts: The ideal algorithm would remove the maximum number of such vertices that is possible, but such an algorithm is related to bin-packing, a problem known to be NP-hard <ref> [Garey & Johnson 79] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Tensor-product wavelets have recently been used to rapidly solve physical simulation problems such as radiosity [Gortler et al. 93, Hanrahan et al. 91, Christensen et al. 94].

Reference-contexts: The construction of subdivision wavelets described herein applies directly to a variety of already existing subdivision schemes. These include piecewise linear subdivision (which produces polyhedra); the schemes of Catmull & Clark <ref> [Catmull & Clark 78, Halstead et al. 93] </ref>, Loop [Loop 87] or Dyn et al. [Dyn et al. 90] (which produce tangent-plane-smooth G 1 subdivision surfaces); and the modifications by Hoppe et al. [Hoppe et al. 94, Hoppe 94] that produce piecewise smooth surfaces with selected discontinuities. <p> More recently, subdivision surfaces have enjoyed a resurgence of interest. Papers by Reif [Reif 92, Reif 93], Cavaretta et al. [Cavaretta et al. 91], Dyn et al. [Dyn et al. 93], and Halstead et al. <ref> [Halstead et al. 93] </ref> have provided convenient tools for analyzing and implementing subdivision surfaces. As a result, their use has become more practical. 2.5.1 Subdivision Rules: Split and Average. <p> Subdivision schemes can be categorized as primal or dual. A subdivision scheme is primal if the faces of the mesh are refined into subfaces by the refinement procedure. Catmull-Clark subdivision <ref> [Catmull & Clark 78, Halstead et al. 93] </ref> is a primal scheme based on subdivision of quadrilateral faces. <p> The lack of an explicit expression for the evaluation of subdivision surfaces makes it difficult to analyze their behavior in the limit, and made early experiences with these surfaces unsatisfactory for many applications. Many of these problems have been recently overcome. Halstead et al. <ref> [Halstead et al. 93] </ref> apply techniques from Eigenanalysis to examine the behavior of the Catmull-Clark scheme in the limit. Their methods also apply to other kinds of subdivision procedures based on local linear averaging.

Hanrahan et al. <ref> [Hanrahan et al. 91] </ref> present a hierarchical method for radiosity. Their technique assumes that a scene is represented by large polygonal patches that may be broken up into smaller elements of constant brightness. They describe a hierarchical algorithm to determine how to break up the larger patches into smaller pieces.

Polyhedral subdivision, the butterfly scheme, and Loop's method <ref> [Loop 87] </ref> are primal schemes based on subdivision of triangular faces.

In the brief time since their development, wavelets have found use in signal analysis <ref> [Mallat 89, Rioul & Vetterli 91] </ref>, image processing [DeVore et al. 92, Mallat & Hwang 92], physics [Arneodo et al. 94], and numerical analysis [Beylkin et al. 91]. <p> An excellent tutorial on the use of wavelets in computer graphics is presented by Stollnitz et al.

Multiresolution analysis as formulated by Mallat <ref> [Mallat 89] </ref> provides a convenient framework by which to develop the analysis and synthesis filters. <p> These translations and dilations are sufficient to set up the nested sequence of linear spaces V j required for a multiresolution analysis over the 16 infinite real line. Mallat's original B-spline wavelets <ref> [Mallat 89] </ref> are constructed to be mutually orthogonal, but have global support and exponential decay. Chui's B-spline wavelets are specially constructed to have minimal support, though at the cost of giving up mutual orthogonality. <p> Constructing wavelets of local support is a common problem in the wavelet literature and has been handled in various ways. Chui [Chui 92a] is able to develop unique locally supported wavelets for B-spline curves. Mallat <ref> [Mallat 89] </ref> builds wavelets that, in addition to being orthogonal to the scaling functions, are mutually orthogonal. Unlike Chui, Mallat's conditions do not allow the construction of locally supported wavelets. Instead, in practice Mallat approximates his wavelets with locally supported truncations that are not strictly orthogonal to their scaling functions.

Reference-contexts: Because of the complexity of the function being minimized, nonlinear optimization with nonlinear constraints requires iterative techniques to converge to a solution.

The surface optimization implemented by Moreton and Sequin <ref> [Moreton 92, More-ton & Sequin 92] </ref> searches to find the optimal setting of hundreds of free variables; their modified conjugate-gradient method requires hours or days to converge for relatively simple surface shapes.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution analysis shares similarities with Fourier analysis. The Fourier transform may also be used to extract frequency information from a discrete set of samples, and the Danielson-Lanczos Lemma <ref> [Press et al. 89] </ref> for the Fast Fourier Transform bears a strong resemblance to the filter bank process used in multiresolution analysis. A significant difference is that wavelet analysis gives information not only about the frequency of the sampled signal, but also about location.

Reference-contexts: Mallat's original B-spline wavelets [Mallat 89] are constructed to be mutually orthogonal, but have global support and exponential decay. Chui's B-spline wavelets are specially constructed to have minimal support, though at the cost of giving up mutual orthogonality. Quak and Weyrich <ref> [Quak & Weyrich 93] </ref> make use of a clever technique that allows them to develop linear time reconstruction filters for B-spline wavelets. When wavelets are used to represent vector-valued functions, such as curves and surfaces, each coordinate in the range space may be described by a separate scalar-valued function. <p> Furthermore, even if locally supported wavelets can be shown to exist, their analysis filters will still be global. Thus, an analogue of the Quak-Weyrich trick for linear time decomposition <ref> [Quak & Weyrich 93] </ref> would also need to be developed for a linear time filter bank. 8.2.5 Real-time Level-of-Detail Control.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, although the Fast Fourier Transform decomposes a signal in time O (n log n), a filter bank can usually be constructed to run in linear time. Spherical harmonics extend Fourier analysis to functions on spherical domains. Spherical harmonics have been used in computer graphics by Sillion et al. <ref> [Sillion et al. 91] </ref> for modeling bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) in global illumination solutions. In this dissertation, methods for developing multiresolution analysis on arbitrary topological types include spherical domains as a special case. <p> Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) are used to model light reflectance in global illumination. BRDFs are defined over a hemispherical domain, but are usually modeled with either an approximation parametrized over the grid [Christensen et al. 96 94] or with spherical harmonics <ref> [Sillion et al. 91] </ref>. Using subdivision wavelets, it is possible to approximate BRDFs with wavelets truly parametrized over a hemispherical domain. This can lead to improved computation for radiance distribution. 8.1.2 Multiresolution Editing.
