Abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model the structure of internetworks, for the study of problems ranging from routing to resource reservation. A variety of graph models are found in the literature, including regular topologies such as rings or stars, "well-known" topologies such as the original ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. Less common is any discussion of how closely these models correlate with real network topologies. We consider the problem of efficiently generating graph models that accurately reflect the topological properties of real internetworks. We compare properties of graphs generated using various methods with those of real internets. We also propose efficient methods for generating topologies with particular properties, including a Transit-Stub model that correlates well with Internet structure. Improved models for internetwork structure have the potential to impact the significance of simulation studies of in-ternetworking solutions, providing basis for the validity of the conclusions.

Reference-contexts: The state of the art in modeling includes: * Regular topologies, such as rings, trees and stars (e.g., [3, 8, 14]) * "Well-known" topologies, such as the ARPAnet or NSFnet backbone (e.g., <ref> [1, 9, 15] </ref>) * Randomly generated topologies (e.g., [10, 11, 12]) The limitations of each of these are obvious: well-known and regular topologies reflect only parts of current or past real networks; random topologies may not reflect any (past, present or future) real network.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, most of the models do not admit an analytic expression even for fairly simple properties. There are two exceptions to this: first, a wide body of work on the properties of (pure) random graphs has been developed, particularly for n ! 1 (e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>); second, we have extended a number of these results to the Locality model. For the remaining models, we rely on empirical results. The expected node degree in the Pure Random model is given by p (n 1), thus p = :035 will produce graphs with m = 175 edges. <p> The fraction of connected graphs sharply increases as ff is increased; this is typical of all of the types of random graphs we study, and has a basis in theoretical analysis of random graphs <ref> [2] </ref>. The relationship between the number of edges and the parameters of the Waxman model is somewhat more complex.

Reference-contexts: In fact, some administrations go to great lengths to hide the topology of their network from the outside world, for reasons of security <ref> [4] </ref>. We do have data for several backbone networks and one campus network (namely the Georgia Tech campus). The results are shown in Table 1. The ARPAnet entries refer to the "old ARPAnet" backbone, which has been used as a topology in a number of simulation studies.

Reference-contexts: in assessing algorithms, consider the following results: * Doar and Leslie found that the inefficiency of their dynamic multicasting algorithms was up to twice as large when using random graphs versus using hierarchically structured graphs designed to reflect some of the properties of real internet works. (See Figure 5 in <ref> [6] </ref>.) * Wei and Estrin found that the traffic concentration in core-based trees is comparable to traffic concentration in shortest-path trees for a network model with average node degree of about 3.0, but the traffic concentration is almost 30% higher in core-based trees than shortest-path trees when average node degree increased <p> have been proposed, including (1) replacing d by a random number between 0 and L [12], (2) scaling P (u; v) by a factor k*=n, where * is the desired average node degree, n is the number of nodes and k is a constant that depends on ff and fi <ref> [6] </ref>, and (3) allowing ff &gt; 1:0 [13]. The second variation, proposed by Doar and Leslie, is included in our study. <p> Clearly, if the random graphs generated are all connected, this construction results in a connected graph. We note that Doar and Leslie proposed a graph model that has a similar hierarchical structure to our model, but is more limited in scope <ref> [6] </ref>. In our implementation, which uses the Stanford Graph Base [7] for portable representation and storage of graphs, different random graph methods and parameters may be plugged in to construct transit and stub domain subgraphs with different characteristics.

By imposing a domain structure resembling that of the Internet, the Transit-Stub model allows creation of large random graphs having realistic average node degree.
