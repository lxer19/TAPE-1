Abstract: Dartmouth Technical Report PCS-TR98-331 fl Abstract Mobile agents are programs capable of migrating from one host machine to another. We propose that mobile agents purchase resource access rights from host machines thereby establishing a market for computational resources and giving agents a metric to evenly distribute themselves throughout the network. Market participation requires quantitative information about resource consumption to define demand and calculate utility. We create a formal utility model to derive user-demand functions, allowing agents to efficiently plan expenditure and deal with price fluctuations. By quantifying demand and utility, resource owners can precisely set a value for a good. We simulate our model in a mobile agent scheduling environment and show how mobile agents may use server prices to distribute themselves evenly throughout a network.

Reference-contexts: Such an option might stabilize prices even further. [SHC96] shows that speculation on these options might further stabilize the market. Standard stock pricing models are based upon random walks, or modified Weiner processes <ref> [Chr97] </ref>. In the absence of shifts in demand, our model's prices definitely do not display the behavior of a random walk since prices tend to return to an equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: Rising prices encourage prospective agents to look elsewhere. This gives agents a mechanism to compare server congestion as well as incentive to distribute themselves evenly across the network.

In this context, utility denotes the satisfaction that a user or agent derives from consuming a given resource. <p> There are two methods: systems can compute the optimal equilibrium prices exactly or estimate the equilibrium prices based upon the past. We are primarily interested in the former, and we build upon ideas taken from WALRAS <ref> [CW98] </ref> and Smart Auctions [MMV95] where sellers compute equilibrium prices by soliciting bids from buyers. In WALRAS, bids are demand functions constructed from a vector of current prices. There is an auctioneer for every good. Bids are submitted to the auctioneers, who compute a price to match supply and demand.

Reference-contexts: If budget information is truly sensitive, the agent should not be trusted with it; however the agent is already at the mercy of the host site, since the host can examine the agent in any fashion it likes <ref> [Gra96] </ref>. Certainly, hosts that abuse agents will earn a bad reputation, and agents will be reluctant to travel to such sites, thus lowering potential earnings from resource sales.

Reference-contexts: An important aspect of this approach is setting up the auction so that there is incentive for prospective buyers to be honest in their bidding. We study this style of market with the intent of applying it to an existing mobile-agent system, D'Agents <ref> [Gra97] </ref>, and to other related applications. One problem mobile-agent system designers face is how to allocate resources to agents. Here, we define resources as access to any computing device or service an agent may use. Examples include compute or network access time and database access.

In economic systems, participants generally try to maximize their utility, but we have yet to quantify utility or see it quantified elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: In this context, utility denotes the satisfaction that a user or agent derives from consuming a given resource. A commonly used utility model in microeconomics is the Cobb-Douglas utility function <ref> [PR92] </ref>, which we apply to generate functions to model user demand and simulate agent resource markets. In this model, an agent's demand function takes the market price for a good and determines the amount that the agent would like to buy. <p> In economic systems, participants generally try to maximize their utility, but we have yet to quantify utility or see it quantified elsewhere. We use a modification of the traditional Cobb-Douglas model from textbook microeconomics. The Cobb-Douglas utility function is a frequently used method of expressing an individual's utility <ref> [PR92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Locating the clearing price can be done relatively quickly using one of several algorithms from <ref> [PTVF92] </ref> since the aggregate demand is well behaved around the market-clearing price. Since hosts have preferences for resource access similar to agents, the host's consumption can be taken into account by including the host's demand in these calculations, and effectively having the host pay itself for access. <p> Figure 1 shows a diagram of the simulation execution of each server. 5.1 A Single Server We first proceed by assuming that there is only a single site agents. The simulation is implemented in C++ with numerical routines from <ref> [PTVF92] </ref>. In our simulation, the server allocates execution time to incoming agents by searching the aggregate demand function for a market clearing price every time an agent enters or exits the system. Agents arrive at a Poisson arrival rate with exponentially distributed job sizes, Q. <p> The simulation shows what we expected: resource price is positively cor 10 related with the number of users present. To measure market efficiency, we use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient <ref> [PTVF92] </ref> of price to load, where load is the sum of the sizes of jobs waiting to be completed. Varying the client arrival intensity has little effect on the load-price correlation. Interestingly, the market requires some variation in user preference to efficiently allocate resources. <p> In reality, agents consume many resources. Computing general equilibrium prices exactly when the market consists of more than two goods is possibly intractable <ref> [Ygg98, PTVF92, p. 379] </ref>. We will address the problem of adding more commodities to our market by investigating the needs of actual mobile-agent applications to construct a general profile of consumable resources.

Reference-contexts: Certainly, hosts that abuse agents will earn a bad reputation, and agents will be reluctant to travel to such sites, thus lowering potential earnings from resource sales. It is possible that important tasks could be performed jointly by several agents in a "chunking" scheme as in <ref> [San97] </ref> to give hosts incentive to act honestly. 14 On the other side of the transaction, there is the question of whether it is an agent's best interest to announce its preference for scheduling (a). Intuitively, overvaluing a could oblige an agent to pay an inflated price.

Reference-contexts: For applications where this is undesirable it would be possible for servers to sell call options for scheduling, which are contracts allowing the holder to access the resource for sometime in the future at a prearranged price. Such an option might stabilize prices even further. <ref> [SHC96] </ref> shows that speculation on these options might further stabilize the market. Standard stock pricing models are based upon random walks, or modified Weiner processes [Chr97].

Reference-contexts: An active unregulated mobile-agent system has a propensity to allow significant groups of agents to accumulate at a single site. A quick calculation gives us a rough estimate of the expected highest load in the network by using a standard application of the Chernoff bound <ref> [SW94] </ref>. If X is a sum of independent random variables, X i , where each X i 2 [0; 1], then for any * &gt; 0: where is the expected value of X.

Reference-contexts: midway through an agent's execution, one would expect a utility model to account for the possibility that the agent cuts its losses and exits the market, but it is generally desirable to construct market mechanisms such that an agent will be better off utilizing the mechanism than abstaining from use <ref> [WW98] </ref>. 6.3 Strengthening Stability One important quality of our model is that it quickly calculates a relatively stable price even given a bursty stream of incoming requests. Approximately 80 percent of all transactions occur within five percent of the mean price. Infrequently, prices can jump well beyond the mean price.
