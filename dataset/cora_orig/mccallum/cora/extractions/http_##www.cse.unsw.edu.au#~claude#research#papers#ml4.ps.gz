Abstract: This paper describes a program which observes the behaviour of actors in a simulated world and uses these observations as guides to conducting experiments. An experiment is a sequence of actions carried out by an actor in order to support or weaken the case for a generalisation of a concept. A generalisation is attempted when the program observes a state of the world which is similar to a some previous state. A partial matching algorithm is used to find substitutions which enable the two states to be unified. The generalisation of the two states is their unifier.

Reference-contexts: As an object is added to a cluster, a generalisation may be performed in order to arrive at a concise description of the cluster. 5. CAP and Magrathea The CAP system works within the the simulated world called Magrathea <ref> (Hume, 1985) </ref>. It is worth noting some of the compromises required in order work with reasonable efficiency in this domain. Magrathea produces a large number of predicates for each state of the world. In order to deal with this overload of information some heuristics are used to eliminate unwanted data.
