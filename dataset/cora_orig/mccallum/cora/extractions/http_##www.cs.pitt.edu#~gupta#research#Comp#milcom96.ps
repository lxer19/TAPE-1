Abstract: This paper describes and evaluates distributed wavelength reservation protocols for all-optical WDM networks. These protocols are essential for applying WDM techniques to large scale all-optical networks. The protocols ensure that the wavelengths on the links along a path are reserved before communication takes place. A message is transmitted using the reserved wavelengths and remains in the optical domain utill it reaches the destination. Based upon the timing at which the reservation is performed, the protocols are classified into two categories: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Although forward reservation protocols are simpler, our performance study shows that backward reservation protocols provide better performance.

Reference-contexts: Upon receiving the probe packet, the destination node start reserving wavelengths along the path towards the source node. Although the protocols are described in this paper for PM, they can easily be modified to apply to LM. Many studies of WDM in optical networks assume a wavelength assignment <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. Few works [6, 7] consider the on-line control mechanisms used to find that assignment. In [6], a distributed control algorithm to establish connections in multiplexed multistage networks is proposed.

Reference-contexts: No optical/electronic or electronic/optical conversion, and thus no electronic processing, is needed at intermediate nodes. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in optical networks can provide multiple channels on each link by making different virtual channels communicate at different wavelengths <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Two approaches, namely link multiplexing (LM) and path multiplexing (PM), can be used to establish connections in optical WDM networks. In WDM networks supporting LM, wavelength conversion devices are needed and a connection can be established if each link along the path has an available wavelength.

Reference-contexts: In optical networks, however, the signal transmission rates are much higher than the electronic processing speeds. The communication bottleneck is thus shifted from the transmission medium to the processing medium. All-optical communication schemes were proposed to reduce the impact of electronic processing on network control <ref> [3] </ref>. In an all-optical network, communications are carried out in pure circuit-switching fashion in the optical domain. No optical/electronic or electronic/optical conversion, and thus no electronic processing, is needed at intermediate nodes. <p> No optical/electronic or electronic/optical conversion, and thus no electronic processing, is needed at intermediate nodes.

Reference-contexts: The protocols described in the above works fall into the forward reservation category. They are extensions of reservation schemes to establish connections in circuit-switching non-multiplexed networks <ref> [4] </ref>. The backward reservation schemes applied to multiplexed networks have not been described and evaluated before. Our study shows that, although backward reservation protocols are slightly more complex than forward reservation protocols, they consistently provide better performance.
