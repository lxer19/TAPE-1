Title: Encoding Plans in Propositional Logic

Abstract: In recent work we showed that planning problems can be efficiently solved by general propositional satisfiability algorithms (Kautz and Sel-man 1996). A key issue in this approach is the development of practical reductions of planning to SAT. We introduce a series of different SAT encodings for STRIPS-style planning, which are sound and complete representations of the original STRIPS specification, and relate our encodings to the Graphplan system of Blum and Furst (1995). We analyze the size complexity of the various encodings, both in terms of number of variables and total length of the resulting formulas. This paper complements the empirical evaluation of several of the encodings reported in Kautz and Selman (1996). We also introduce a novel encoding based on the theory of causal planning, that exploits the notion of lifting from the theorem-proving community. This new encoding strictly dominates the others in terms of asymptotic complexity. Finally, we consider further reductions in the number of variables used by our encodings, by compiling away either state variables or action-variables.

Reference-contexts: The operation of our SATPLAN system can also be viewed as a form of refinement planning, as shown by Kambhampati and Yang (1996). 2 DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL FRAMEWORK Planning problems are specified using standard STRIPS notation <ref> (Fikes and Nilsson 1971) </ref>. A planning problem P is a tuple hOps; Dom; S 0 ; S 1 i, where Ops is a set of operator definitions, Dom is a domain of individuals, and S 0 and S 1 are the initial and goal states, respectively.

Reference-contexts: The results in this paper are dealt with in more detail in Kautz et al. (1996). While this paper concentrates on reductions of planning to Boolean satisfiability, it is important to note that there is related work that views planning as general constraint satisfaction <ref> (e.g., Joslin and Pollack 1995) </ref>. We believe that the various techniques introduced in our reductions, such as operator splitting, lifting, and compilation, will also prove to be applicable in the more general CSP setting.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In recent work we have shown that planning problems can be efficiently solved by general propositional satisfiabil-ity algorithms <ref> (Kautz and Selman 1996) </ref>. On instances drawn from logistics and blocks-world planning problems, both systematic and local-search SAT algorithms often dramatically outperform earlier domain-independent planning systems. A key issue in this approach is the development of practical reductions of planning to SAT. <p> When both operator splitting and explanatory frame axioms are employed, the size of the entire reduction is then dominated by the size of the frame axioms. We will discuss this issue in the expanded version of this paper <ref> (Kautz et al. 1996) </ref>. When explanatory frame axioms are used, one may optionally weaken the exclusiveness axioms, so that they assert that at most one action occurs at each time instance. Furthermore, it is no longer necessary to introduce null actions to account for solutions that are shorter than n.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we use m to denote the maximum combined length of the precondition, add, and delete lists for any operator. 3 LINEAR ENCODINGS Linear encodings, introduced by Kautz and Selman (1992), are quite similar to a propositionalized version of the situation calculus <ref> (McCarthy and Hayes 1969) </ref>, but with additional axioms included to rule out certain unintended models that are harmless for deductive formalizations, but problematic for the model-finding (SAT) approach.

Reference-contexts: Of course, not all SAT problems of a given size are equally difficult, and the known results that quantify the hardness of randomly-generated SAT problems based on its size and clause-ratio <ref> (Mitchell, Selman, and Levesque 1992) </ref> cannot be directly applied to structured problems. However, experiments reported in Kautz and Selman (1996) using the SATPLAN system on problems derived from planning provide some rough guidelines.

Reference-contexts: When combined with a linear time algorithm for Boolean Horn clauses, the schemas define a cubic time unification algorithm. The classical Robinson unification algorithm is exponential time but a linear time algorithm is known <ref> (Patterson78) </ref>. It is also worth noting that in the lifted SAT problems that result from encodings of planning problems we need only schemas 1 through 5. In these lifted problems variables can only be bound to constants so no occurs-check reasoning is needed.
