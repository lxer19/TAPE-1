Title: Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite  
Author: S.M. Bellovin* 
Address: Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974  
Affiliation: AT&T Bell Laboratories  
Abstract: The TCP/IP protocol suite, which is very widely used today, was developed under the sponsorship of the Department of Defense. Despite that, there are a number of serious security flaws inherent in the protocols, regardless of the correctness of any implementations. We describe a variety of attacks based on these flaws, including sequence number spoofing, routing attacks, source address spoofing, and authentication attacks. We also present defenses against these attacks, and conclude with a discussion of broad-spectrum defenses such as encryption.

Reference-contexts: Despite that, there are a number of serious security flaws inherent in the protocols. Some of these flaws exist because hosts rely on IP source address for authentication; the Berkeley ``r-utilities'' <ref> [3] </ref> are a notable example. Others exist because network control mechanisms, and in particular routing protocols, have minimal or non-existent authentication. When describing such attacks, our basic assumption is that the attacker has more or less complete control over some machine connected to the Internet. <p> The Berkeley manuals <ref> [3] </ref> have always stated that the authentication protocol was very weak, but it is only recently that serious attempts (i.e., Kerberos [35] and SunOS 4.0's DES authentication mode [52] ) have been made to correct the problem.

Reference-contexts: We do discuss some problems with Berkeley's protocols, since these have become de facto standards for many vendors, and not just for UNIX systems. 2. TCP SEQUENCE NUMBER PREDICTION One of the more fascinating security holes was first described by Morris <ref> [7] </ref> . Briefly, he used TCP sequence number prediction to construct a TCP packet sequence without ever receiving any responses from the server.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, one could wait until T was down for routine maintenance or a reboot. A variant on this TCP sequence number attack, not described by Morris, exploits the netstat <ref> [8] </ref> service. In this attack, the intruder impersonates a host that is down. If netstat is available on the target host, it may supply the necessary sequence number information on another port; this eliminates all need to guess 1 .

Reference-contexts: How accurately can the trip time be measured? If we assume that stability is good, we can probably bound it within 10 milliseconds or so. Clearly, the Internet does not exhibit such stability over the long-term <ref> [9] </ref> , but it is often good enough over the short term. 2 There is thus an uncertainty of 2500 in the possible value for ISN S .

Reference-contexts: A combination of a fine-granularity increment and a small random number generator, or just a 32-bit generator, is better. Note, though, that many pseudo-random number generators are easily invertible <ref> [10] </ref> . In fact, given that most such generators work via feedback of their output, the enemy could simply compute the next ``random'' number to be picked.

Reference-contexts: It is not comforting to know that the security of a network relies on its low quality of service. - 4 - Rather than go to such lengths, it is simpler to use a cryptographic algorithm (or device) for ISN S generation. The Data Encryption Standard <ref> [11] </ref> (DES) in electronic codebook mode [12] is an attractive choice as the ISN S source, with a simple counter as input. Alternatively, DES could be used in output feedback mode without an additional counter. Either way, great care must be taken to select the key used.

Reference-contexts: Performance of the initial sequence number generator is not a problem. New sequence numbers are needed only once per connection, and even a software implementation of DES will suffice. Encryption times of 2.3 milliseconds on a 1 MIPS processor have been reported <ref> [13] </ref> . An additional defense involves good logging and alerting mechanisms. Measurements of the round-trip time essential for attacking RFC-compliant hosts would most likely be carried out using ICMP Ping messages; a ``transponder'' function could log excessive ping requests.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of this idea is probably not worthwhile. Some protocols (i.e., Berkeley's rlogin and rsh) permit ordinary users to extend trust to remote host/user combinations. In that case, individual users, rather than an entire system, may be targeted by source routing attacks. 4 Suspicious gateways <ref> [14] </ref> will not help here, as the host being spoofed may not be within the security domain protected by the gateways. 3.2 Routing Information Protocol Attacks The Routing Information Protocol [15] (RIP) is used to propagate routing information on local networks, especially broadcast media. Typically, the information received is unchecked.

This allows an intruder to send bogus routing information to a target host, and to each of the gateways along the way, to impersonate a particular host.
Reference: 16. <author> Mills, </author> <title> D.L. Exterior Gateway Protocol Formal Specification . RFC 904, </title> <year> 1984. </year>
Reference-contexts: Permitting ordinary users to extend trust is probably wrong in any event, regardless of abuse of the protocols. But such concerns are beyond the scope of this paper. - 6 - 3.3 Exterior Gateway Protocol The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) <ref> [16] </ref> is intended for communications between the core gateways and so-called exterior gateways. An exterior gateway, after going through a neighbor acquisition protocol, is periodically polled by the core; it responds with information about the networks it serves. These networks must all be part of its autonomous system.
Reference: 17. <author> Postel, J. </author> <title> Internet Control Message Protocol . RFC 792, </title> <year> 1981. </year>
Reference-contexts: the core. (More accurately, the core could only speak to a few particular hosts, though as noted such checks are not currently implemented.) It may thus be hard to get the raw data needed for such an attack. 3.4 The Internet Control Message Protocol The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) <ref> [17] </ref> is the basic network management tool of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It would seem to carry a rich potential for abuse. Surprisingly, ICMP attacks are rather difficult; still, there are often holes that may be exploited.
Reference: 18. <author> St. Johns, M. </author> <title> Authentication Server . RFC 931, </title> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: If the genuine response is not blocked by the intruder, though, the target will receive multiple replies; a check to ensure that all replies agree would guard against administrative errors as well. 4. THE ``AUTHENTICATION'' SERVER As an alternative to address-based authentication, some implementations use the Authentication Server <ref> [18] </ref> . A server that wishes to know the identity of its client may contact the client host's Authentication Server 7 , and ask it for information about the user owning a particular connection.

Reference-contexts: The author has seen situations where RIP instability following a gateway crash has led to erroneous ICMP Redirect messages. These had the effect of permanently corrupting the routing tables on other hosts. 7. The Internet Activities Board does not currently recommend the Authentication Server for implementation <ref> [19] </ref> . However, the decision was not made because of security problems [5] . - 8 - A less-obvious risk is that a fake authentication server can always reply ``no''. This constitutes a denial of service attack.

Reference-contexts: TCP by itself is inadequate. 5. HERE BE DRAGONS Some protocols, while not inherently flawed, are nevertheless susceptible to abuse. A wise implementor would do well to take these problems into account when providing the service. 5.1 The ``Finger'' Service Many systems implement a finger service <ref> [23] </ref> . This server will display useful information about users, such as their full names, phone numbers, office numbers, etc.

Reference-contexts: This server will display useful information about users, such as their full names, phone numbers, office numbers, etc. Unfortunately, such data provides useful grist for the mill of a password cracker. <ref> [24] </ref> By running such a service, a system administrator is giving away this data. 5.2 Electronic Mail Electronic mail is probably the most valuable service on the Internet. Nevertheless, it is quite vulnerable to misuse. As normally implemented [25][26] , the mail server provides no authentication mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, it is quite vulnerable to misuse. As normally implemented [25][26] , the mail server provides no authentication mechanisms. This leaves the door wide open to faked messages. RFC 822 does support an Encrypted header line, but this is not widely used. (However, see RFC 1040 <ref> [27] </ref> for a discussion of a proposed new encryption standard for electronic mail.) 5.2.1 The Post Office Protocol The The Post Office Protocol (POP) [28] allows a remote user to retrieve mail stored on a central server machine.

Reference-contexts: RFC 822 does support an Encrypted header line, but this is not widely used. (However, see RFC 1040 [27] for a discussion of a proposed new encryption standard for electronic mail.) 5.2.1 The Post Office Protocol The The Post Office Protocol (POP) <ref> [28] </ref> allows a remote user to retrieve mail stored on a central server machine. Authentication is by means of a single command containing both the user name and the password. However, combining the two on a single command mandates the use of conventional passwords.

Reference-contexts: In one major respect, PCMAIL is more dangerous: it supports a password-change command. This request requires that both the old and new passwords be transmitted unencrypted. __________________ 8. One-time passwords were apparently first used for military IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) systems <ref> [29] </ref> . - 9 - 5.3 The Domain Name System The Domain Name System (DNS) [32][33] provides for a distributed database mapping host names to IP addresses.

Reference-contexts: And since the user does not know the key it is irretrievably stored in the device the password cannot be given away without depriving the user of the ability to log in. The newest version of POP <ref> [30] </ref> has split the user name and password into two commands, which is useful. However, it also defines an optional mechanism for preauthenticated connections, typically using Berkeley's mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: However, it also defines an optional mechanism for preauthenticated connections, typically using Berkeley's mechanisms. Commendably, the security risks of this variant are mentioned explicitly in the document. 5.2.2 PCMAIL The PCMAIL protocol <ref> [31] </ref> uses authentication mechanisms similar to those in POP2. In one major respect, PCMAIL is more dangerous: it supports a password-change command. This request requires that both the old and new passwords be transmitted unencrypted. __________________ 8.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there is no authentication mechanism provided in the AXFR request; source address authentication is the best that can be done. Recently, a compatible authentication extension to the DNS has been devised at M.I.T. The Hesiod name server <ref> [34] </ref> uses Kerberos [35] tickets to authenticate queries and responses. The additional information section of the query carries an encrypted ticket, which includes a session key; this key, known only to Hesiod and the client, is used to compute a cryptographic checksum of the both the query and the response.

Kerberos and SunOS 4.0 have their weaknesses, but both are far better than their predecessor.
Reference: 36. <author> Postel, J. </author> <title> File Transfer Protocol . RFC 959, </title> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: These checksums are also sent in the additional information field. 5.4 The File Transfer Protocol The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) <ref> [36] </ref> itself is not flawed. However, a few aspects of the implementation merit some care. 5.4.1 FTP Authentication FTP relies on a login and password combination for authentication. As noted, simple passwords are increasingly seen as inadequate; more and more sites are adopting one-time passwords.

Reference-contexts: The second problem is that anonymous FTP is truly anonymous; there is no record of who has requested what information. Mail-based servers will provide that data; they also provide useful techniques for load-limiting 9 , background transfers, etc. 5.5 Simple Network Management Protocol The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <ref> [37] </ref> has recently been defined to aid in network management. Clearly, access to such a resource must be heavily protected. The RFC states this, but also allows for a null authentication service; this is a bad idea.

Reference-contexts: If such networks are used, physical access must be strictly controlled. It is also unwise to trust any hosts on such networks if any machine on the network is accessible to untrusted personnel, unless authentication servers are used. If the local network uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) <ref> [42] </ref> more subtle forms of host-spoofing are possible. In particular, it becomes trivial to intercept, modify, and forward packets, rather than just taking over the host's role or simply spying on all traffic. It is possible to launch denial of service attacks by triggering broadcast storms .

Reference-contexts: At the conclusion of the dialog, each side is convinced of the identity of the other. Versions of the algorithm exist for both private-key and public-key <ref> [43] </ref> cryptosystems. How do these schemes fit together with TCP/IP? One answer is obvious: with them, preauthenticated connections can be implemented safely; without them, they are quite risky.

Reference-contexts: Many portions of the DARPA Internet employ forms of link encryption. All Defense Data Network (DDN) IMP-to-IMP trunks use DES encryption, even for non-classified traffic; classified lines use more secure cryptosystems <ref> [46] </ref> . These, however, are point-to-point lines, which are comparatively easy to protect. A multi-point link encryption device for TCP/IP is the Blacker Front End (BFE) [47] . The BFE looks to the host like an X.25 DDN interface, and sits between the host and the actual DDN line.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted, of course, that any of these encryption schemes provide privacy. Often that is the primary goal of such systems. 7.3 Trusted Systems Given that TCP/IP is a Defense Department protocol suite, it is worth asking to what extent the Orange Book <ref> [48] </ref> and Red Book [49] criteria would protect a host from the attacks described above. That is, suppose that a target host (and the gateways!) were rated B1 or higher. Could these attacks succeed? The answer is a complex one, and depends on the assumptions we are willing to make.

Reference-contexts: IP also makes use of the security option <ref> [50] </ref> . A packet may not be sent over a link with a lower clearance level. If a link is rated for Secret traffic, it may carry Unclassified or Confidential traffic, but it may not carry Top Secret data. Thus, the security option constrains routing decisions.

Reference-contexts: Thus, many B-division systems do not implement such servers. In a practical sense, some of the technical features we have described may not apply in the military world. Administrative rules <ref> [51] </ref> tend to prohibit risky sorts of interconnections; uncleared personnel are not likely to have even indirect access to systems containing Top Secret data. Such rules are, most likely, an accurate commentary on anyone's ability to validate any computer system of non-trivial size. 8.

Reference-contexts: The Berkeley manuals [3] have always stated that the authentication protocol was very weak, but it is only recently that serious attempts (i.e., Kerberos [35] and SunOS 4.0's DES authentication mode <ref> [52] </ref> ) have been made to correct the problem. Kerberos and SunOS 4.0 have their weaknesses, but both are far better than their predecessor.
