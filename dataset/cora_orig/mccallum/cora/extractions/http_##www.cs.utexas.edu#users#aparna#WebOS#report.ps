Title: PERK A Scalable Distributed Virtual Storage System Report  
Author: by Aparna D. Chennapragada 
Date: May 29, 1998  
Abstract: An ideal storage subsystem for distributed systems has to meet the demands of high availability, huge capacity, reliability and performance and yet require minimal amount of management. This paper describes the approach, design and implementation of PERK, a system that attempts to meet these requirements using a combination of two existing systems Petal and RIO. PERK consists of a collection of network-connected servers that co-operatively manage a pool of physical storage resources (reliable RAM backed up by physical disks). To a PERK client (a file system or database), this collection appears as a highly available block-level storage system that provides large abstract containers called virtual disks. The system is aimed to support multiple per-virtual-file-system data redundancy schemes and tolerate disk and server failures. The system builds this virtual storage interface on top of a RAM file cache that is made reliable using virtual mem ory protection techniques.
