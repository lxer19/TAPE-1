Abstract: We found that of the cognitive abilities tested in our study, only spatial ability could be related to the time spent in completing a set of tasks in a large, hypermedia, information structure. We furthermore found that it was only certain aspects of spatial ability which were related to the ability navigate in hypermedia, namely those related to solving spatial problems mentally rather than solving spatial problems in the physical world.

Reference-contexts: There are studies that show that previous experience is the most important factor for determining the ability to navigate in hypermedia (Karlgren 1992), while other claim that search tactics are influenced by, among other, spatial scanning abilities <ref> (Allen 1992) </ref>. For other kinds of human-computer interaction situation, spatial ability seem to one crucial factor. For example, Vicente and Williges found that spatial ability could be linked with whether users get lost in a hierarchical file system (1988).

Reference-contexts: In particular, cognitive and personality traits are most resis tant to change, (Carroll 1983). Attempts to isolate individual cognitive differences are generally based around the production of various aptitude tests and other devices designed to isolate specific factors <ref> (Dillon and Schmeck 1983, Dillon 1985) </ref>. Cognitive abilities, or cognitive skills, seek to describe the methods by which humans process information (van der Veer 1994). The relationships between navigation in hypermedia and the users cognitive abilities, is not clear.

In general, is recognised that navigation is a complex activity which substantially adds to the users cognitive load. Individual differences influence navigation Individual differences appear to have a big impact on human-computer interaction in general (Egan 1988).

Reference-contexts: In general, is recognised that navigation is a complex activity which substantially adds to the users cognitive load. Individual differences influence navigation Individual differences appear to have a big impact on human-computer interaction in general <ref> (Egan 1988) </ref>. When designing tools for navigation in hypermedia, individual differences may be one crucial factor that a system should accommodate to. It has been suggested, (van der Veer 1989), that some characteristics of people are more resistant to change than others.

Reference-contexts: Spatial ability is a cognitive characteristic which offers a measure of a user's ability to conceptualise the spatial relationships between objects. It is closely allied to the notion of a cognitive map <ref> (Neisser 1976) </ref>, and (following (Vicente et al. 1987) and (Vicente and Williges 1988)), may also be related to a user's ability to navigate through a complex space.

Reference-contexts: Navigation is a difficult cognitive activity Navigation in large hypermedia information structures has long been recognised as a difficult and demanding task. The expression lost in hyperspace describes what happens when users loose track of where they are and where to go next in the hypertext (see for example <ref> (Nielsen, 1990) </ref>). Navigation is a concept which has been studied with respect to such things as Polynesian sailors crossing the sea (for an overview, see (Hutchins, 1994)) and finding ones way around cities (Streeter and Vitello 1985, Streeter et al. 1985, Streeter and Vitello 1986, Hk and Karlgren 1991).

Reference-contexts: This would have helped the users to know where in the information space they were currently at. On the other hand, it is not clear that all users with low spatial ability would be helped by such maps. We know that there are many users with low map-reading skills <ref> (Streeter and Vitello 1986) </ref>. Still, since map-reading skill was correlated with factor 1 and not with factor 3, we could achieve a better interface for those with high ability in factor 1 but not so high ability in factor 3.

Reference-contexts: Spatial ability is a cognitive characteristic which offers a measure of a user's ability to conceptualise the spatial relationships between objects. It is closely allied to the notion of a cognitive map (Neisser 1976), and (following (Vicente et al. 1987) and <ref> (Vicente and Williges 1988) </ref>), may also be related to a user's ability to navigate through a complex space. Conceptual issues While there are similarities between navigation in the real world and navigation in the virtual world of hypermedia, there are also at least one important difference. <p> Thirdly, it has been shown that users with low spatial ability are helped by system which achieves visual momentum <ref> (Vicente and Williges 1988) </ref>. Visual momentum is achieved when parts of the previous state of the interface is visible after the user has made an action at the interface. Let us take a hierarchical file system with folders and files in folders as an example.
