Title: The Lovasz Theta Function and a Semidefinite Programming Relaxation of Vertex Cover  
Author: Jon Kleinberg Michel Goemans 
Date: April 1995  
Abstract: Let vc(G) denote the minimum size of a vertex cover of a graph G = (V; E). It is well-known that one can approximate vc(G) to within a factor of 2 in polynomial time; and despite considerable investigation, no (2 ") approximation algorithm has been found for any " &gt; 0. Because of the many connections between the independence number ff(G) and the Lovasz theta function #(G), and because vc(G) = jV j ff(G), it is natural to ask how well jV j #(G) approximates vc(G). It is not difficult to show that these quantities are within a factor of 2 of each other (jV j#(G) is never less than the value of the canonical linear programming relaxation of vc(G)); our main result is that vc(G) can be more than (2") times jV j#(G) for any " &gt; 0. We also investigate a stronger lower bound than jV j #(G) for vc(G).

Reference-contexts: Semidefinite programming relaxations have recently proved useful in obtaining improved approximation algorithms for a number of well-studied optimization problems, including maximum cut and satisfiability problems [6], vertex coloring [9], and the maximum independent set problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Probably the most well-known semidefinite programming relaxation is the theta function #(G) of Lovasz [10]. This was introduced as a relaxation of the maximum independent set problem and used in [10] to show the polynomial-time solvability of the maximum independent set and minimum vertex coloring problems in perfect graphs. <p> This was introduced as a relaxation of the maximum independent set problem and used in [10] to show the polynomial-time solvability of the maximum independent set and minimum vertex coloring problems in perfect graphs. More recently it has been used in the approximation algorithms of [9] and <ref> [1] </ref>. Let ff (G) denote the maximum weight of an independent set of G, and W = P the sum of all vertex weights in G. Since vc (G) = W ff (G), it is natural to ask how well W #(G) approximates vc (G). <p> The gap between vc (G) and n #(G) can also be obtained from a construction due independently to Alon and Kahale <ref> [1] </ref> | their concern was with the complement of our problem: graphs G with small independence number for which #(G) converges to 1 2 n.

Reference-contexts: Thus this linear program leads to a 2-approximation algorithm for the vertex cover problem.

Reference-contexts: We also note that the recent construction of Feige <ref> [4] </ref>, showing that the ratio 2 #(G)=ff (G) can be as large as n 1o (1) , is of no use for our purposes; for the graphs he deals with, the ratio of vc (G) to n #(G) converges to 1, not 2.

Reference-contexts: Thus sd (G " ) is close to n=2. But using a theorem of Frankl and Rodl <ref> [5] </ref>, we can show that G " does not have large independent sets, and thus that vc (G " ) is close to n. The details are as follows. Let " 0 be a rational number such that " 0 ". <p> Moreover, the value of the objective function with these vectors is equal to 1 2 (1 + ff)n, sd (G " ) 2 5 Now we show a lower bound on vc (G " ); for this we need the following theorem of Frankl and Rodl <ref> [5] </ref>. Let C be a collection of m-bit strings, ~ a constant satisfying 0 &lt; ~ &lt; 1 2 , and d an even integer satisfying ~m &lt; d &lt; (1 ~)m.

Reference-contexts: Then clearly vc (G) lp (G); but we also have lp (G) vc (G)=2, as the set fi : x i 1=2g in any feasible solution x to (LP) is easily seen to be a vertex cover for G (Hochbaum <ref> [7] </ref>). Thus this linear program leads to a 2-approximation algorithm for the vertex cover problem. There has been considerable work on the problem of finding a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with an improved performance guarantee; the best bound currently known is 2 log log n 2 log n [2, 11].

The new formulation is obtained by observing the following.
