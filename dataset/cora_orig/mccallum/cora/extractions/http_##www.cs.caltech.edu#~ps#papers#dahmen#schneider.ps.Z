Reference-contexts: To explain this we need the notion of Sobolev spaces H s () defined on . Depending on the regularity of the surface they are for a certain range of exponents naturally defined as trace spaces (see <ref> [A, G] </ref> for details). For smooth boundaries , K is known to be a pseudodifferential operator of order r = 0. The order r may be defined as the degree of homogeneity of the symbol of the operator.

This turns out to remain true under much more general circumstances. To describe the mechanism one has to be a bit more specific about the setting.

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, e.g. <ref> [BP, BWY] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If A has positive order and is self-adjoint it should be noted that closely related alternative preconditioners referred to as BPX preconditioners or multilevel Schwarz schemes <ref> [BPX, DK, O1, O2, GO] </ref> are available. These techniques do not require explicit knowledge of the complement bases j .

Reference-contexts: The whole system (2.7) is indefinite though and it is well-known that the stable solvability of (2.7) is equivalent to the validity of the Ladysenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi condition (LBB) <ref> [BF, GR] </ref> q2M h v2V h kvk H 1 0 () n kqk L 2 ()=IR This condition seriously constrains the choice of trial spaces. For n = 3 the list of known admissible pairs of finite element trial spaces is significantly shorter than that for n = 2. <p> As explained in (II) we seek for pairs of finite dimensional spaces V j V , M j M such that (5.12) holds uniformly in j 2 IN 0 (see (2.8)). Our starting point is the following well-known observation due to Fortin <ref> [BF, GR] </ref>. Proposition 5.1 Suppose that V , M satisfy (5:12).

Reference-contexts: As soon as one has to deal with function spaces defined on domains other than IR n or the torus, such techniques are usually not applicable. The common 28 theme of <ref> [D1, D2, D3, CDP] </ref> is to develop an appropriate general framework for multiscale techniques which are applicable to more realistic problems. Two major issues arise in this context. <p> On the other hand, one has to develop new tools for actually realizing these properties for concrete constructions. We briefly review next one general concept that has proven to be quite useful in several applications <ref> [CDP] </ref>. <p> The idea is to generate from such an initial completion ^ M j;1 another stable completion M j;1 which possesses better properties <ref> [CDP, Sw] </ref>. As a first step one has to parametrize the set of all stable completions in order to see then how to choose the parameters for a suitable one. <p> j;1 ; G j;1 = K 1 ^ G j;1 : (5.46) Moreover, one can show that whenever M j;1 and ^ M j;1 are any two stable completions of M j;0 then they are related by (5.44) for some L j , K j with the properties stated above <ref> [CDP] </ref>. This can be used in several ways. The point of view taken in [Sw] may be roughly described as follows. Given some `simple' initial bases j with refinement matrices M j;0 , e.g. <p> Once the projectors Q j satisfying (5.48) are known one has to identify complement basis j , ~ j such that D E 1 [ (fjg fi r j ): (5.52) Given some initial stable completion ^ M j;1 of M j;0 this can indeed be facilitated as follows <ref> [CDP] </ref>. Theorem 5.2 Let f j g, f ~ j g, M j;0 , ~ M j;0 be related by (5:38), (5:50) and (5:51). Suppose that ^ M j;1 is some stable completion of M j;0 and that ^ G j = ^ M 1 j .

Reference-contexts: These facts have been already observed in <ref> [CDM] </ref>. They have also been utilized in [LRT] for the purpose of evaluating univariate refinable functions and also integrals of the form (5.29) in one dimension (called connection coefficients there). However, in order to make this approach work one has to deal with the following uniqueness questions. <p> In <ref> [CDM] </ref> it is shown that convergence of S a implies the existence of a unique ' 2 C 0 (IR mn ) which is refinable with respect to a. Conversely, a-refinability and ` 1 -stability of ' 2 C 0 (IR mn ) imply convergence in the above sense.

Reference-contexts: In the following we will briefly review some recent first results about adaptive strategies for multiscale basis methods which rely on an a-posteriori error estimate and can be proved to converge for a wide range of elliptic problems <ref> [DDHS] </ref>. We adhere to the general setting from Sections 3 and 4.1. A key role will again be played by norm equivalences of the form (3.18) or (3.25).

Before describing this in more detail let us briefly pause to indicate the usefulness and consequences of this fact in the context of the above applications. <p> When jj &gt; 0 and n &gt; 1 the corresponding refinable integrals already give rise to different eigenvectors. So one has to find additional conditions which uniquely determine these eigenvectors. These problems have been addressed and solved first in <ref> [DM1] </ref>. One of the conditions derived there is based on certain factorizations of the symbols a i (z). In the multivariate case these factorizations may not always exist. Alternative conditions which are always applicable can be derived with the aid of subdivision techniques.

As a first step one has to parametrize the set of all stable completions in order to see then how to choose the parameters for a suitable one. <p> This can be used in several ways. The point of view taken in <ref> [Sw] </ref> may be roughly described as follows. Given some `simple' initial bases j with refinement matrices M j;0 , e.g. <p> This can be exploited to increase the efficiency of corresponding multiscale transformations T j significantly <ref> [Sw] </ref>. Next one can exchange the roles of M j and G fl j (the formal adjoint of G j ) which results in modifying the original 30 bases j .

Reference-contexts: A further reduction of the solution complexity may be expected by adapting the trial spaces to the particular problem at hand. Adaptive procedures have been studied on various levels of generality. The messages conveyed by some of these results differ significantly as to the actual success of such techniques <ref> [DY, KN1, KN2, TWW] </ref> on a principal level. On the other hand, practical experience gained in connection with solving partial differential equations clearly confirms a tremendeous power of adaptive techniques which make certain problems computable at all [HJ].

Reference-contexts: Similar saddle point problems arise through mixed formulations of the second order problems from (I) where, in particular, the same form b (u; q) = (div u; q) appears motivating the study of divergence free basis functions <ref> [DKU1, U] </ref>. (III) Boundary integral equations The computation of electrostatic fields or scattering from obstacles are typical problems where a boundary value problem is to be solved on the exterior of some bounded domain. <p> j 0 )); (4.25) we employ Gaussian quadrature with order D = ff [(minfj 0 ; jg J + ff 1 )r + (J j)d 0 + (J j 0 )d 0 + log 2 *] + with d &lt; d 0 , ff ~ (log 2 q) 1 and <ref> [u] </ref> + := maxf0; ug.

Reference-contexts: Adaptive refinement strategies based on a-posteriori local error estimators or indicators have been particularly far developed in a finite element context <ref> [BEK, BR, HJ, Ve] </ref>. Nevertheless, rigorous proofs for the precise convergence behavior of such techniques are by far less advanced.
