Abstract: Surface reconstruction from range data acquired using a vareity of sources has been a very active area of research in computational vision over the past decade. Generalized splines have emerged as the single most popular approximation tool to this end. In this paper we present a new and fast algorithm for solving the surface reconstruction problem using the membrane spline which yields a C 0 surface. Our algorithm for dense data constraints takes O(N ) computational time, where N is the number of nodes in the discretization. For sparse data constraints, the algorithm requires O(log N= 2 ) iterations with each iteration taking O(N ) time. The number of iterations in this case depends on a prespecified error tolerance. We demonstrate the algorithm performance on synthesized sparse range data.

Reference-contexts: To be more specific, division by 0 (or a number very close to 0) may occur in computing ff k and fi k . These two different breakdowns may be avoided by using the look-ahead Lanczos algorithm or the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. As in the CG-algorithm, preconditioning techniques can speed up the convergence of the BCG algorithm. In this paper, we use the technique similar to the hierarchical conjugate gradient (HCG) method, which involves smoothing the residual vector in each step.

We will now briefly present a variational principle formulation of the surface reconstruction problem <ref> [9] </ref>.

To compute a numerical solution to the above minimization problem, we first discretize the functionals E s and E d using finite element techniques <ref> [9] </ref>. For constant (x; y) and t (x; y) the energy function is a quadratic form. <p> The minimum of this energy function u is found by solving the large sparse linear system Kx = b (7) Another way of approaching the solution to the minimization of the energy E is using calculus of variations <ref> [9] </ref>. The necessary condition for the minimum of the energy functional is a partial differential equation called the Euler-Lagrange equation. Discretization of this PDE leads to a system of algebraic equations as given in 7.
