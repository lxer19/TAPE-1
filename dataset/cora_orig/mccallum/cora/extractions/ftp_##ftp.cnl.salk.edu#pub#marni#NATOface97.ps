Abstract: In natural visual experience, different views of an object or face tend to appear in close temporal proximity. A set of simulations is presented which demonstrate how viewpoint invariant representations of faces can be developed from visual experience by capturing the temporal relationships among the input patterns. The simulations explored the interaction of temporal smoothing of activity signals with Hebbian learning (Foldiak, 1991) in both a feed-forward system and a recurrent system. The recurrent system was a generalization of a Hopfield network with a lowpass temporal filter on all unit activities. Following training on sequences of graylevel images of faces as they changed pose, multiple views of a given face fell into the same basin of attraction, and the system acquired representations of faces that were approximately viewpoint invariant.

Reference-contexts: There were twenty individuals at each of five poses, ranging from 30 ffi to 30 ffi . The faces were automatically located in the frontal view image by using a feature-based template matching algorithm <ref> (Beymer, 1994) </ref>. The images were normalized for luminance and scaled to 120 x 120. Images were presented to the model in sequential order as the subject changed pose from left to right (Figure 2).

In the feedforward system, the Competitive Learning rule (Rumelhart & Zipser, 1985) is extended to incorporate an activity trace on the output unit activities <ref> (Foldiak, 1991) </ref>. The recurrent component of the simulation examines the development of temporal associations in an attractor network. Perceptual representations have been related to to basins of attraction in activity patterns across an assembly of cells (Amit, 1995; Freeman, 1994; Hinton & Shallice, 1991).

Reference-contexts: We show that the combination of basic Hebbian learning with temporal smoothing of unit activities produces a generalization of an attractor network learning rule that associates temporally proximal input patterns into basins of attraction <ref> (Griniasty, Tsodyks, & Amit, 1993) </ref>. <p> ) + (y i j y 0 ) + 2 (y i (t1) y 0 ) (5) This learning rule is a generalization of an attractor network learning rule that has been shown to associate random input patterns into basins of attraction based on serial position in the input sequence <ref> (Griniasty, Tsodyks & Amit, 1993) </ref>. The first term in this equation is basic Hebbian learning. The weights are proportional to the co variance matrix of the input patterns at time t. The second term performs Hebbian association between the patterns at time t and t 1. <p> The third term is Hebbian as sociation of the trace activity for pattern t 1. The following update rule was used for the activation V of unit i at time t from the lateral inputs <ref> (Griniasty, Tsodyks, & Amit, 1993) </ref>: V i (t + ffit) = h X i Where is a neural threshold and (x) = 1 for x &gt; 0, and 0 otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Such view-based representations may be particularly relevant for face processing, given the psychophysical evidence presented in this volume for face representations based on low-level filter outputs (see Biederman, Bruce, this volume). In example-based models of recognition such as radial basis functions <ref> (Poggio & Edelman, 1990) </ref>, neurons with view-independent responses are proposed to pool responses from view-dependent neurons. This model suggests a mechanisms for how this pooling could be learned.

Reference-contexts: The time course of the modifiable state of a neuron, based on the open time of the NMDA channel, has been modeled by a lowpass temporal filter on the post-synaptic unit activities <ref> (Rhodes, 1992) </ref>. This paper examines the contribution of such temporal smoothing to the development of viewpoint invariant responses in both a feedfor stimuli in the fixed training sequence. Stimuli were in color. Bottom: Autocorrelograms on the sustained firing rates of AIT cells along the serial position number of the stimuli. <p> We showed that a lowpass temporal filter on unit activities, which has been related to the time course of the modifiable state of a neuron <ref> (Rhodes, 1992) </ref>, cooperates with Hebbian learning to (1) increase the viewpoint invariance of responses to faces in a feedforward system, and (2) create basins of attraction in an attractor network which associate temporally proximal inputs.
