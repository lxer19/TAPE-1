Abstract: We present a new environment for browsing a visual landscape inhabited by digital movies that live, interact and play in a graphical virtual world. The movies are modeled as autonomous agents which have their own sensors and goals and which can interpret the actions of the participant and react to them. Our environment allows one|or more|people to interact with the HyperPlex world through the use of vision techniques. No goggles, gloves or wires are needed: interaction takes place with the use of computer vision techniques that analyze the image of the person. An extension of this system to a multi-user game is currently being considered.

Reference-contexts: The behavior of each visual object is modeled using Blumberg's computational model of action-selection <ref> [ Blumberg, 1994a ] </ref> . In Blumberg's framework an agent's set of activities is organized as a loose hierarchy with the top of the hierarchy representing more general activities magic room and the leaves representing more specific activities.

Reference-contexts: Blumberg's behavior based autonomous agents' model <ref> [ Blumberg, 1994b ] </ref> offers an ideal framework to develop dynamic displays. It provides tools to build animated characters for interactive virtual environments that are not only capable of autonomous action but respond also to the user's input.

Reference-contexts: It is much better if interaction takes place by the use of gesture and voice recognition systems (multi-modal interaction). The user becomes a 3D-mouse that can point at or highlight different portions of the screen, and give simple commands <ref> [ Darrell et al., 1994 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The user becomes a 3D-mouse that can point at or highlight different portions of the screen, and give simple commands [ Darrell et al., 1994 ] . Research at the Interactive Cinema group has created a video browsing environment for large databases of digital video <ref> [ Davenport, 1993 ] </ref> , by making the spatial dimension of the displayed information (i.e., where things appear on the screen) as important as its temporal dimension (i.e., what comes after what in a video sequence).

Reference-contexts: The key design idea of their collaborative medium is to make use of translucent overlay to combine the workspaces of the different users together with the users' image. Other solutions that involve interactive control of the camera in the virtual world are also being taken into consideration <ref> [ Drucker et al., 1992 ] </ref> . The design of the user interface is based on the analysis of popular computer games [ Crawford, 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: The art of game design comes in constructing a set of different possible interactions with the environment. "The difference between the New Hollywood and the Old is that computer games are 'interactive cinema' in which the game player takes on the role of the protagonist" <ref> [ Friedman, 1995 ] </ref> . However most of the adventure or explorative type of computer games currently on the market do not have a "content orchestrator" or story-telling system.

Reference-contexts: However most of the adventure or explorative type of computer games currently on the market do not have a "content orchestrator" or story-telling system. They import a narrative structure from popular stories and reduce the narrative trajectory of the user to a succession of enchanted worlds to explore <ref> [ Fuller and Jenkins, 1995 ] </ref> . Our approach aims to orchestrate the presentation of the visual material in the HyperPlex with respect to the content and the temporal structure [ Davenport et al., 1993 ] , all embedded in a game.

Reference-contexts: However we make use of two distinct levels of representation: the plot level and the presentation level <ref> [ Galyean, 1994 ] </ref> . At the plot level the orchestrator of the environment records the past events and plans ahead while the user's input continuously influences the presentation.

Reference-contexts: Each user would "connect" to the world from its own location and engage in a game with the other users present at the same time. An interesting solution to having many users sharing the same environment that we would like to explore is the one proposed by <ref> [ Ishii et al., 1994 ] </ref> . The key design idea of their collaborative medium is to make use of translucent overlay to combine the workspaces of the different users together with the users' image.

Reference-contexts: Each movie clip appears in the form of a window on the screen showing a keyframe from the clip. Keyframe windows can move around in a manner that tries to reflect the "personality" of each clip (see <ref> [ Las-seter, 1987; Johnson, 1995 ] </ref> ); keyframe windows also react to the user's gestures and voice in a manner characteristic of the clip. The behavior of each visual object is modeled using Blumberg's computational model of action-selection [ Blumberg, 1994a ] .

Reference-contexts: First of all, in certain interface tasks using a gesture, rather than clicking or choosing from a menu, can give the user a better feeling of the responsiveness of the system. Also there are tasks that can be given uniquely with gesture input <ref> [ Kurtenbach and Hulteen, 1990 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: They also satisfy some of the criteria for creating com-pelling interactive systems proposed by Brenda Laurel in A Taxonomy of Interactive Movies <ref> [ Laurel, 1989 ] </ref> : : : : you need to think about intelligent animation| characters who know what they look like and how they move : : : it means generating (or retrieving) and then manipulating backgrounds as the action is pieced together: : : 4 Content Orchestration and Game <p> At the plot level the orchestrator of the environment records the past events and plans ahead while the user's input continuously influences the presentation. Although the user is engaged in exploring the HyperPlex, the interactive form of our system is not uniquely "navigational" <ref> [ Laurel, 1989 ] </ref> . Where the user goes does affect the world and the user's previous choices of the content also determines the subsequent material presented.

Reference-contexts: Research by the Autonomous Agents group has considered how computer programs ("agents") should respond to user's activity given their internal motivation, past history and a perceived environment with its attendant opportunities, challenges and changes <ref> [ Maes, 1995 ] </ref> . Moreover, the pattern and rhythm of the chosen activities should be such that it neither dithers between multiple activities nor persists too long in a single activity.

Reference-contexts: The use of a computer vision system to measure the user eliminates the need to harness the user with many sensors and wires. A large display format allows an immersive experience without the need for head-mounted displays and opens the environment up to multiple users <ref> [ Russell et al., 1995 ] </ref> . The vision system is composed of several layers. The lowest layer uses adaptive models to segment the user from the background. This allows the system to track users without the need for chromakey backgrounds or special garments.

Reference-contexts: It provides tools to build animated characters for interactive virtual environments that are not only capable of autonomous action but respond also to the user's input. Dynamic displays may also offer one possible answer to the aesthetic question raised by <ref> [ Youngblood, 1989 ] </ref> : How has the corpus of aesthetic strategies in herited in a medium like photography or film transferred over to electronic media and espe cially to the code? They allow: image transformation ("if mechanical cinema is the art of transition, electronic cinema is the art of transformation"),
