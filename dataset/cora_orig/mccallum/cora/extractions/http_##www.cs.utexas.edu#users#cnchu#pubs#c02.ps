Abstract: In this paper, we consider the delay minimization problem of a wire by simultaneously considering buffer insertion, buffer sizing and wire sizing. We consider three versions of the problem, namely using no buffer, using a given number of buffers, and using optimal number of buffers. We provide elegant closed form optimal solutions for all these versions.

Reference-contexts: Although this flexibility is not useful in minimizing delay, it can be used to optimize other objectives such as total wire area, total power consumption or maximum wire width. We can extend our results to handle nets with tree topology by a similar technique as <ref> [4] </ref>. That is we use an iterative algorithm to size the tree edges one at a time. At each time we manipulate an edge, we keep the sizes of all the other edges fixed and apply our solution to that edge.

Reference-contexts: We will also discuss how to extend our results to handle nets with tree topology and to handle wire fringing capacitance. Many proofs in this paper contain a lot of tedious manipulation of complicated mathematical expressions and so only proof outlines are given due to space limitation. Please read <ref> [5] </ref> for proof details.

Reference-contexts: That means using different segment lengths does not have any advantage with respect to delay. For previous papers which consider delay minimization by wire sizing, the problems are usually formulated as changing segment widths while segment lengths are given as input. In <ref> [7] </ref> and [9], they assume that the input segment lengths are all equal and then they solve the problems by iterative algorithms. Our results justify the assumption they made.
