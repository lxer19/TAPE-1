Reference-contexts: Many of them are based on a database-style modeling of data, global schema, and use of meta-information such as provided by a common ontology or different domain ontologies for a content-based source selection <ref> [7, 1, 25, 6] </ref>.

Alternative solutions towards an adaptive process for revealing semantic interdependencies among heterogeneous data objects is proposed, e.g., by SCOPES [20]. <p> Complex reasoning has to be restricted to allow meaningful semantic matches of requests and advertisements in a reasonable time. Unlike other approaches to matchmaking or brokering in multia-gent systems <ref> [1, 16, 19] </ref>, the presented matchmak-ing process using Larks offers a flexible approach to satisfy both requirements. It does not deal with a global integration of heterogeneous source descriptions in terms of database schemas, but with comparing descriptions of functional capabilities such as constrained actions to provide services. <p> The matchmaker agent does not need to perform any complex query activities such as, e.g., by broker agents in InfoSleuth [19] or the mediator agent in SIMS <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition, we have developed protocols for efficient, distributed matchmaking among multiple matchmaker agents [10]. 5 Implementation We did implement the language Larks and the matchmaking process using Larks in Java. The following figure shows the user interface of the matchmaker agent.

Reference-contexts: Service providers provide some type of service, such as finding information, or performing some particular domain specific problem solving. Requester agents need provider agents to perform some service for them. Agents that help locate others are called middle agents <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For performance reasons the match maker does not deal with dynamically resolving ambiguities due to potential genericity and polysemy in the AN (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). 4 Related Works For dealing with semantic heterogeneity among distributed, autonomous information sources there exist solutions in the multidatabase and information systems area for years.

Reference-contexts: The AN is the partial global ontology of the matchmaker dynamically built In our implementation an associative network is created by the matchmaker by using the computed concept subsumption hierarchy and additional associations extracted from the WordNet ontology <ref> [4] </ref>. We assume that the terminological subsumption relation among two concepts in the partial global ontology of the matchmaker may be identified with a real world semantical relation among them.

Reference-contexts: The language should support the use of domain or common ontologies for specifying agents capabilities. Since none of the existing languages for program description such as Z [21], knowledge representation, like KIF <ref> [13] </ref>, or description formats, like RDF [22], satisfies our requirements, we propose an agent capability description language, called Larks (Language for Advertisement and Request for Knowledge Sharing), that enables for advertising, requesting and matching agent capabilities. A specification in Larks is a frame with the following slot structure.

Reference-contexts: Besides, one has to devise an efficient mechanism to determine a structural and semantic match of descriptions in that language. This means in particular to use methods for reconciling potentially semantic heterogeneous informations <ref> [14] </ref>. There is an obvious trade-off between the quality and efficiency of matchmaking on the Internet. In the following, we briefly present the agent capability description language, Larks, and then discuss the matchmaking process using Larks. The paper concludes with a brief comparison with related works.

Reference-contexts: In our implmentation the logical implication among constraints is computed using polynomial - subsumption checking for Horn clauses <ref> [18] </ref>. Plug-in matching of Larks specifications is valuable for selecting advertisements which are not as constrained in the input parameters as the considered request, but will return equal or greater number of more specific output parameters.

Alternative solutions towards an adaptive process for revealing semantic interdependencies among heterogeneous data objects is proposed, e.g., by SCOPES <ref> [20] </ref>. However, the main problem of dynamic match-making in the Internet is to deal with the tradeoff between performance and quality of matching. Complex reasoning has to be restricted to allow meaningful semantic matches of requests and advertisements in a reasonable time.

Reference-contexts: Descriptions should not only be easy to read and understand, but also easy to write by the user. The language should support the use of domain or common ontologies for specifying agents capabilities. Since none of the existing languages for program description such as Z <ref> [21] </ref>, knowledge representation, like KIF [13], or description formats, like RDF [22], satisfies our requirements, we propose an agent capability description language, called Larks (Language for Advertisement and Request for Knowledge Sharing), that enables for advertising, requesting and matching agent capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Word distance is computed using the trigger-pair model <ref> [23] </ref>. If two words are significantly co-related, then they are considered trigger-pairs, and the value of the co-relation is domain specific. In the current implementation we use the Wall Street Journal corpus of one million word pairs to compute the word distance.

Reference-contexts: This is done with a profile filter that compares two Larks specifications by using a variant of the known TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) technique <ref> [24] </ref>. According to that, any specification is treated as a document. TF-IDF determines the degree of similarity between two documents based on frequency and relevance of words in a document considering a finite set of documents. (in our case the advertisement database of the matchmaker).

Reference-contexts: This means, that the logical constraints defined in the term of the concept C 0 logically imply those of the more general concept C 2 . We assume that the subsumption relation among two concepts may be identified with a real world semantic relation among them. Like in <ref> [25] </ref>, we utilize an injective, domain-independent mapping among primitive components which occur in the concept definitions based on given synonym relations 3 . The matchmaker computes the subsumption relations among the concepts included in any advertisement he receives from registered provider agents. <p> Many of them are based on a database-style modeling of data, global schema, and use of meta-information such as provided by a common ontology or different domain ontologies for a content-based source selection <ref> [7, 1, 25, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The matchmaker determines the relationship among two semantic descriptions written as concepts in Itl by computing the respective concept subsumption relation <ref> [27] </ref>: A concept C subsumes another concept C 0 if the extension of C 0 is a subset of that of C. This means, that the logical constraints defined in the term of the concept C 0 logically imply those of the more general concept C 2 .
