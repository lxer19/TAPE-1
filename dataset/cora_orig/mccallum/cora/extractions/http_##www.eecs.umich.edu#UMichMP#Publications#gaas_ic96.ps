Abstract: A DARPA-funded project at the University of Michigan has as a goal the development of technologies and tools needed to implement microprocessors that can be clocked at GHz speeds. A Complementary GaAs HIGFET technology from the Motorola CS-1 facility (CGaAs) is the target semiconductor process. While this technology is immature, it is years ahead of CMOS in terms of fast gate delay at low power supply voltages. A major focus of this work is advanced packaging, which supports partitioning of the design into multiple integrated circuits, each having an integration level that should be achievable in CGaAs. This paper touches on the major aspects of the project, process technology, circuit design, packaging, architecture, CAD tools and software, with an emphasis on application of the CGaAs technology.

Reference-contexts: The remarkable decrease in cost vs. performance for microprocessors has made computing ubiquitous in our society. Through their astonishing advances in performance, microprocessors have replaced traditional mainframes and supercomputers with workstations and servers <ref> [1] </ref>. Current processor trends can be seen by surveying the microprocessors presented at ISSCC over the past ten years: gate delays have decreased at 12% per year; clock frequencies have increased at 40% per year; and transistor counts have grown at 40% per year [2].

The performance of systems made from these processors, as measured by the integer SPEC benchmarks, has been growing at 59% per year, resulting in an increase in computing power of more than 100 fold over the decade.

Reference-contexts: For example, the designers of the Intel Pentium Pro reduced the initial instruction-issue width of four to three in order to reduce chip size and complexity and enable an increase in the initial clock frequency from 100 to 150 MHz <ref> [3] </ref>. A general industry trend at the 1995 Hot Chips conference toward simpler CPUs running with higher clock frequencies was noted in [4].

Reference-contexts: Scaling of CMOS to channel lengths of 0.35 mm, together with planarization techniques which can produce five levels of fine-pitch metal interconnect have pushed the clock speed of commercial CMOS processors to as high as 500 MHz <ref> [5] </ref>. A number of leading semiconductor manufacturers will offer 0.25-mm CMOS processes in the first half of 1997. The importance of semiconductor technology to future high-end computer performance warrants evaluation of exotic processes such as complementary GaAs.

Reference-contexts: The state-of-the art in CMOS low-power processors is exemplified by the IBM 401GF, which consumes just 40 mW (typical) from a 2.5-V supply at 25 MHz; 100-MHz parts are expected before the end of 1996 <ref> [6] </ref>. CGaAs, operating with a 1-V supply, would have a dynamic-power advantage of 1:6.25 over this 2.5-V CMOS process if parasitic capacitances were equivalent. II. COMPLEMENTARY GAAS CGaAs overcomes many of the problems of E/D MESFET DCFL technology, in which we have designed several prototype microprocessors [7, 8, 9].

COMPLEMENTARY GAAS CGaAs overcomes many of the problems of E/D MESFET DCFL technology, in which we have designed several prototype microprocessors <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref>. Digital circuits are less efficient in DCFL than CMOS because the MESFET source 2 of 4 resistance prohibits the stacking of enhancement devices, resulting in a NOR-only logic family. Furthermore, a large off-state leakage current limits the fan-in of high-speed gates to four.

Reference-contexts: The most difficult challenge in implementing an E/D MESFET microprocessor is on-chip memory design. The current-leakage problem and lack of a complementary pull-up device make these circuits large and power-hungry compared to CMOS memories. A complementary heterostructure-insulated-gate FET process, on the other hand <ref> [10] </ref>, has many of the characteristics of CMOS. Though it, too, has a Schottky-diode gate, the forward voltage of the heterostructure diode is large enough to make gate current negligible under static operating conditions.

Reference-contexts: III. MICROPROCESSOR PROJECT In addition to semiconductor process technology, which has been described, the UM GaAs microprocessor project, called PUMA, includes architecture, operating system, compiler, packaging, CAD tool and circuit design aspects. A. Architecture The general architecture of the PUMA processor follows that of the PowerPC <ref> [11] </ref>, but we view the fabrication process as the performance driver, so the instruction set and microar-chitecture are being tailored to fit the CGaAs technology.

Reference-contexts: CAD tool developments are also vital to the packaging strategy. D. CAD Tools The proposed packaging approach requires CAD developments in order for the tools to directly place and route the array pads. The integrated circuits are being designed with the Cascade Design Automation EPOCH <ref> [12] </ref> circuit compiler. This tool suite is being extended to enable it to distribute pads, pad-drivers and receivers in an array. In addition, a number of MCM-specific capabilities are being added to the tools.
