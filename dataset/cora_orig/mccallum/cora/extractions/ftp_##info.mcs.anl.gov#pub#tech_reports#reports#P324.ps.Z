Reference-contexts: The time integration uses a fourth-order finite difference scheme (Brown and Campana, 1978) with optional split-explicit time stepping. Model physics is highly configurable across a variety of convection, clouds, planetary boundary layer, radiative transfer, and other standard and optional parameterizations. The model may be run nonhydro-statically for high-resolution simulations <ref> (Dudhia, 1992) </ref>. The model provides a nested-grid capability. A four-dimensional data assimilation module allows observed weather data dynamically incorporated into a simulation. The MM is used for a range of compu-tationally demanding applications, including real-time forecasting, storms research, and climate research.

Reference-contexts: This can be done efficiently and with a minimum of recoding by using a fine-grained decomposition and software tools that abstract out mechanisms for redistributing work between processors from the parallel model code. One such tool is Program Composition Notation (PCN), a high-level language for expressing parallel programs <ref> (Foster et al., 1992) </ref>. Parallel processes and communication streams between parallel processes are easily and abstractly represented in this language. Another benefit of MPP software tools such as PCN is that they provide portability over a wide range of parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: Third, we expect future parallel computers to provide either multitasking or vectorization facilities within each node, allowing vertical parallelism to be exploited by compilers. 3.3 Load Balancing Atmospheric models are subject to load imbalances resulting from varying amounts of work over the model grid <ref> (Michalakes, 1991) </ref> when decomposed over a set of distributed memory processors in a multicomputer.
