Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new algorithms for the dynamic maintenance of approximated solutions of Min-Weighted Node Cover and Min-Weighted Set Cover. For what concerns Min-Weighted Node Cover, for any sequence of edge insertions and deletions, the algorithms maintain an solution whose approximation ratio (that is, the ratio between the approximate and the optimum value) is equal to the best asymptotic one for the static case. The algorithms require O(1) time for edge insertion, while an O(1) amortized time is required for edge deletion. For what regards Min-Weighted Set Cover, we present dynamic algorithms whose approximation ratio matches one of the two different and incomparable best approximate bounds for the static case. The time complexity for element insertion and its amortized complexity for element deletion are proportional to the maximum redundancy of an element in the approximate solution. fl The work of the first two authors was partially done while visiting the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, Ca. Work partially performed in the framework of Esprit BRA projects "ALCOM" and "ALCOM 2", and of Italian MURST 40% project "Algoritmi, Modelli di Calcolo e Strutture Informative" and partially supported by the National Research Council (CNR) Project "Sistemi Informatici e Calcolo Parallelo"

Reference-contexts: Many research efforts have been aimed to the design of efficient off-line approximation algorithms for such problems ([4], [5], [7], [8], [13], [14], [17], [20], [22], [23]) and in order to design efficient on-line algorithms we will start from the approach introduced in [13] and then exploited in <ref> [3] </ref>.

The approximation ratio of our algorithm is equal to the one given in [13] and in <ref> [3] </ref>, while its complexity for element insertion and its amortized complexity for element deletion are proportional to the maximum redundancy of an element in the approximate solution. <p> Several efficient (polynomial-time) approximation algorithms for Min-Weighted Node Cover have been introduced in the literature. In particular, in [13] and in <ref> [3] </ref> it was shown how to derive an approximated solution whose value is at most two times the optimum value. This result has been slightly improved in [14], in [22], [5], where the ratio between the approximated value and the optimum is bounded by 2 o (1). <p> Let S k 2 F j such that w k = min weight; 11. for each S i 2 F j do 12. w i := w i min weight; 13.

Because of this reason we will start from the Bar-Yehuda, Even algorithm. <p> The following theorem has been proved in [13] and in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> It is easy to see that such a sequence corresponds to a possible sequence of edges (and nodes) chosen during some application of the Bar-Yehuda and Even algorithm. The Lemma derives by observing that any Node Cover returned by the algorithm in <ref> [3] </ref> has an approximation ratio bounded by 2. 2 Theorem 3.5 Algorithms insert edge and delete edge maintain an approximate solution of the Min-Weighted Node Cover problem with approximation ratio 2.
