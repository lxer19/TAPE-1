Abstract: Latent dependencies and relationships between groups of attributes in databases can produce inference channels which pose serious security threats. This paper uses a powerful knowledge discovery formalism for modeling and identifying latent inference channels in relational databases. The inference discovery methodology supports the analysis of precise and imprecise inference in database schemes and extensions. A prototype tool for aiding inference discovery in Oracle databases is described. This interactive graphical tool is useful for identifying compromising inference channels in large databases with many hidden dependencies.

Reference-contexts: This paper uses a powerful knowledge discovery formalism for modeling and identifying FD-based imprecise inference channels in relational databases <ref> [5] </ref>. The inference discovery methodology supports the analysis of precise, imprecise, and catalytic inference in mixed databases. A prototype tool for aiding inference discovery in Oracle databases is described. <p> The concept of a "context" or domain partition is used to formulate generalized domain integrity and entity integrity properties, and the important notion of an imprecise functional dependency. Readers are referred to <ref> [5] </ref> for details about the context model. 2.1 Contexts and Database Relations A "context" C is a partition on a set ^ D generated by an equivalence relation on ^ D, a subset of the underlying database domain D. <p> An inference channel is created by threading original and/or induced FDs. An imprecise inference channel, like its precise counterpart, is composed of a "use set" of FDs [8]. Linear inference channels are considered because it is always possible to express nonlinear channels as combinations of linear channels <ref> [5] </ref>. 5 Definition: An imprecise inference channel from X (C X ) to Z (C Z ) is a sequence of imprecise FDs, F = F 1 ; F 2 ; :::; F n , such that X (C X ) = LHS (F 1 ), Z (C Z ) =

Reference-contexts: Imprecise inference analysis and knowledge discovery also play a major role in investigating inference attacks based on external knowledge. These attacks occur when users engage common knowledge and existing database data to infer sensitive information. Common sense knowledge, typically expressed in imprecise terms, could be introduced as "catalytic relations" <ref> [6] </ref> to existing precise databases. The catalytic relations expand the inference closure and help manifest new, potentially compromising inference channels. The presence of imprecise relations fl To whom correspondence should be addressed (email: sujeet@euler.mcs.utulsa.edu).

It is defined with respect to the channel contexts C 1N and C IS , and establishes the granularity of the actual information inferred through the channel. 3.3 Catalytic Inference Analysis The introduction of common sense information catalyzes knowledge discovery in databases <ref> [6] </ref>. The expanded inference closure contains new, potentially compromising inference channels. The first step in catalytic inference analysis is to augment an existing database with catalytic information in the form of rules (functions), or, more generally, catalytic relations and associated FDs. Thereafter, the methodology is similar to imprecise inference analysis. <p> Our approach to knowledge discovery is more general in that it can be applied to identify precise and imprecise inference paths. The catalytic inference analysis feature is motivated by the work of Hinke and Delugach <ref> [6] </ref>. However, our tool extends their work by modeling and identifying catalytic inference channels in mixed databases containing precise and imprecise relations. The knowledge discovery tool operates on Oracle databases. It performs a variety of tasks including defining inference paths and relations, deriving inference channels, and querying relations.

Reference-contexts: Several researchers have considered the problem of detecting and eliminating "precise" inference channels [2-4,6,9,12,14]. Precise inference channels allow low users to infer the exact values of sensitive attributes. Su and Oszoyoglu showed that the detection and elimination of precise inference compromises in multilevel secure (MLS) databases are NP-complete problems <ref> [14] </ref>. More recently, researchers at SRI International developed DISSECT, a tool for detecting and eliminating precise inference channels due to foreign key FDs in MLS database schemes [3,12]. Imprecise inference models the ability to infer approximations (sets or intervals).
