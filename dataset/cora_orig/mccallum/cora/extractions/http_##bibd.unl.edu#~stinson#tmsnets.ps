Abstract: In this paper, we provide a generalization of the classical Rao bound for orthogonal arrays, which can be applied to ordered orthogonal arrays and (t; m; s)-nets. Application of our new bound leads to improvements in many parameter situations to the strongest bounds (i.e., necessary conditions) for existence of these objects.

Reference-contexts: is a collection of points, in the s-dimensional unit cube, that satisfies certain desirable uniformity properties which are useful for applications in numerical integration and pseudorandom number generation. 1 There has been considerable interest in both constructions and bounds for existence of (t; m; s)-nets. (For a recent survey, see <ref> [1] </ref>.) In this paper, we study bounds (necessary conditions) for (t; m; s)-nets. Most previous general bounds for (t; m; s)-nets are derived from the observation that the existence of a (t; m; s)-net implies the existence of an orthogonal array with certain parameters. <p> This is discussed in more detail in <ref> [1] </ref>, where various bounds on orthogonal arrays are also reviewed. <p> When we consider the application of our bound to (t; m; s)-nets, we make use of some observations that simplify the computations required. Finally, in Section 5, we compile some tables of bounds, which provide numerous improvements to the best previous bounds from <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 A new bound for ordered orthogonal arrays Suppose A is an OOA (k; s; `; v), where C denotes the set of columns of A. Suppose D is a function, D : C ! Z v . <p> maxfs : b n GR (nt; s; nt; b) for nt even, t+2 n mg: We tabulate S fl (t; m; 2) for 1 t 11, t + 2 m 15, m t even, in Table 1, where we also record the best previously known upper bounds on s from <ref> [1] </ref> (as given in the Tables on the web site http://www.emba.uvm.edu/~colbourn/jcd/toappear.html in the version of September 12, 1997). (As mentioned before, we can restrict our attention to m t odd since S fl (t; m; b) = S fl (t; m 1; b) if m t is odd.) For the values <p> we can restrict our attention to m t odd since S fl (t; m; b) = S fl (t; m 1; b) if m t is odd.) For the values of m and t considered in Table 1, our new bound is at least as good as the bound from <ref> [1] </ref>, except for (t; m) = (2; 6) and (5; 13). There are numerous cases where our bound improves the bound from [1]. The reader may have noticed that we have omitted the cases m = t and t + 1. <p> if m t is odd.)

There are numerous cases where our bound improves the bound from [1]. The reader may have noticed that we have omitted the cases m = t and t + 1. This is because a (t; m; s)-net in base b exists for any s if m = t or m = t + 1 (see [9]). <p> In a similar manner, we tabulate S fl (t; m; 3) for 1 t 11, t + 2 m 15, m t even, in Table 2, comparing it to the best previously known bounds upper bounds on s from <ref> [1] </ref>. As was the case in Table 1, we find a significant number of improvements. 6 Comments We have derived a generalized Rao bound that can be applied to ordered orthogonal arrays and (t; m; s)-nets.

Reference-contexts: An equivalent result, shown independently by Lawrence [3, 4], was stated in terms of generalized orthogonal arrays. We will present our results in terms of ordered orthogonal arrays. We use the definition of Edel and Bierbrauer <ref> [2] </ref>, which is equivalent to Schmid's.

Then A is balanced with respect to D 0 . We now define ordered orthogonal arrays, using the notation of Edel and Bierbrauer <ref> [2] </ref>. An OOA (k; s; `; v) is a v k fi s` array of v elements, say A, which satisfies the following properties: 1. The set of columns, C, is partitioned into s groups of ` columns, denoted C 1 ; : : : ; C s .

Reference-contexts: Thus, it has been conjectured that the bounds on (t; m; s)-nets that are derived from orthogonal array bounds are generally not the strongest possible bounds. This conjecture in fact was verified in one parameter situation by Lawrence <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we prove a generalization of the classical Rao bound for orthogonal arrays, which can be applied to (t; m; s)-nets. This extends the result of Schmid and Wolf [12, Proposition 1], who proved an identical bound for the special case of digital (t; m; s)-nets. <p> (2n; s) = i=0 i ; then it is not hard to prove that a n;0 = 1 a n;i = a n1;i1 + 2a n1;i : An interesting test case is that of a (1; 5; 6)-net in base 2, which has been shown not to exist by Lawrence <ref> [5] </ref> by an ad hoc argument (non-existence of this object does not follow from any previously known general bound).

Reference-contexts: This raises the question if other bounds for orthogonal arrays could be generalized in a similar fashion.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1987, Niederreiter <ref> [9] </ref> introduced the idea of a (t; m; s)-net in base b. (In fact, a restricted class of these objects, having b = 2, were studied by Sobol' in 1967 [13].) A (t; m; s)-net is a collection of points, in the s-dimensional unit cube, that satisfies certain desirable uniformity properties <p> There is one other result that is useful in computing bounds for (t; m; s)- nets. Niederreiter <ref> [9] </ref> has proven that the existence of a (t; m; s)-net in base b implies the existence of a (t; n; s)-net in base b for all integers n such that t + 2 n m. <p> The reader may have noticed that we have omitted the cases m = t and t + 1. This is because a (t; m; s)-net in base b exists for any s if m = t or m = t + 1 (see <ref> [9] </ref>).

Appealing to Theorem 2.2, we have the following bound for (t; m; s)-nets in base b.
