Abstract: Genetic algorithms have been extensively used in different domains as a means of doing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. However, in some realistic engineering design optimization domains it was observed that a simple classical implementation of the GA based on binary encoding and bit mutation and crossover was sometimes inefficient and unable to reach the global optimum. Using floating point representation alone does not eliminate the problem. In this paper we describe a way of augmenting the GA with new operators and strategies that take advantage of the structure and properties of such engineering design domains. Empirical results (initially in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft and the domain of high performance supersonic missile inlet design) demonstrate that the newly formulated GA can be significantly better than the classical GA in terms of efficiency and reliability. http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~shehata/papers.html

Reference-contexts: slab structure, the line joining two evaluable points is likely to remain in the evaluable region and is not unlikely to uncover better points of the search space as well. * Shrinking window mutation: This operator may be viewed as a simplified version of the Dynamic Mutation operator introduced in <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> . When crossover is done using the line crossover operator described above, the point resulting from crossover is not directly introduced to the GA population as a new individual.

Reference-contexts: Therefore there are evaluable and unevaluable points in the search space and among the evaluable points there are feasible points (representing physically realizable designs) and infeasible points. The evaluable points were observed to form slab-like evaluable regions that are not axis parallel and therefore, as <ref> [ 20 ] </ref> pointed out, the classical crossover operator of the GA is not likely to give any good results. <p> Rank selection prevents the first discovered evaluable/feasible points from dominating the population. * Line crossover: This operator may be viewed as a generalized version of the linear crossover operator introduced in <ref> [ 20 ] </ref> . After two candidates for crossover have been selected, the crossover is done by joining a line between the two candidates and choosing a point at random along this line or its extensions from either side.
