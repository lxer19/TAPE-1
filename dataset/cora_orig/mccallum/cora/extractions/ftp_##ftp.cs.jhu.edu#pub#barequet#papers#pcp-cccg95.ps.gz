Reference-contexts: Likewise, @t (P ) is the boundary of the translated polygon t (P ). In addition to this notation, we also use the following definitions. Given two polygons P and Q such that P contains Q. Chazelle <ref> [1] </ref> defines a contact point between P and Q as an intersection of a vertex of Q with an edge of P . <p> Note that unlike Chazelle's original general definition, a translation stable placement is not defined by contact points but by two distinct points in S both on the boundary of t (P ). Using these definitions, we may now proceed with the preliminary results. 2.1 Limiting the Search Space Chazelle <ref> [1] </ref> showed that if a polygon P contains a polygon Q, then there exists a rigid motion (translation and rotation) of P containing Q and in a stable placement.

Reference-contexts: Problem 1 also relates to the fixed radius search problems and to problems of optimal object placement. Chazelle and Lee <ref> [2] </ref> first solved the problem of placing a fixed radius circle to contain the largest subset of a given set S. Their algorithm requires O (n 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: For example, finding the smallest circle enclosing a given point set S is a famous problem in computational geometry. (See [13, pp. 255-259] for a brief summary.) This problem has been naturally extended to the smallest enclosing triangle <ref> [7, 11, 3] </ref>, square, and rectangle [15], and the smallest enclosing convex polygon. Another variant of this problem is: Given a set S of planar points and a fixed integer k, find a region that contains a k-subset of S and minimizes some measure such as area, radius, or circumference.

Reference-contexts: Their algorithm for minimizing circumradius (equivalent to finding the smallest k-enclosing circle) requires O (n log n + kn log k) time and O (n log n + kn + k 2 log k) space. Recent work by Datta, Lenhof, Schwartz, and Smid <ref> [4] </ref> has also provided further improvements and refinements. A closely related problem is to find a placement of a region that maximizes the size k of the subset contained.

Reference-contexts: Efrat, Sharir, and Ziv [6] give algorithms for computing the smallest k enclosing circle in O (nk log 2 n) time and O (nk) space, or O (nklog 2 n log (n=k)) time and O (n log n) space.

Reference-contexts: Both of the algorithms make use of a method for computing in O (log m) time the intersections between two translated copies of an m-vertex convex polygon. This method is based on prune-and-search techniques presented by Kirkpatrick and Snoeyink <ref> [9] </ref>. 2 Geometric Preliminaries We now present some geometric results necessary for our latter algorithms. We begin with some definitions and notation that will be used throughout the paper. We use q i to represent the ith point in our input set S. <p> The proof of this lemma follows from recent results of Kirkpatrick and Snoeyink <ref> [9] </ref> on tentative prune-and-search techniques for computing fixed-points. The intersections between @t 1 (P ) and @t 2 (P ) can be found from the two parallel chords of P of length and direction t 2 t 1 . It is shown in [9] that the fixed-point of the composition of <p> from recent results of Kirkpatrick and Snoeyink <ref> [9] </ref> on tentative prune-and-search techniques for computing fixed-points. The intersections between @t 1 (P ) and @t 2 (P ) can be found from the two parallel chords of P of length and direction t 2 t 1 . It is shown in [9] that the fixed-point of the composition of a monotone increasing piecewise-basic function and a monotone decreasing piecewise-basic function can be computed in O (log m) time using tentative prune-and-search techniques. <p> The algorithms are conceptually simple, using either a plane sweep or an anchored sweep. They are also self-contained except for the use of the tentative prune-and-search technique of Kirk-patrick and Snoeyink <ref> [9] </ref> for computing intersections of the polygons in O (log m) time, beating the more straightfor ward nested binary search which would require O (log 2 m) time.

Reference-contexts: If A S =A P is !(n), then we use either a hash table to explicitly store only those buckets actually containing points from S, or a degraded grid approach as suggested in various papers by Lenhof and Smid <ref> [10] </ref>. Both of the algorithms make use of a method for computing in O (log m) time the intersections between two translated copies of an m-vertex convex polygon. <p> Every bucket reference is resolved with a lookup to this O (n) sized hash table, which can be done in O (1) expected case time. A second approach is that of so-called degraded grids introduced by Lenhof and Smid <ref> [10] </ref>. The idea is to use varying sized buckets, whose size is the same as R P if they contain a point, but which grow maximally long and maximally wide if empty.

Reference-contexts: Their algorithm requires O (n 2 ) time.

This approach solves in O (n log n) time the problem of finding an optimal translation of a rectangle to cover the maximum sized subset of S.

Reference-contexts: Applications include optimal object placement (CAD), clustering, and statistical data analysis. As may be expected, there are many variants of this generally stated problem. For example, finding the smallest circle enclosing a given point set S is a famous problem in computational geometry. (See <ref> [13, pp. 255-259] </ref> for a brief summary.) This problem has been naturally extended to the smallest enclosing triangle [7, 11, 3], square, and rectangle [15], and the smallest enclosing convex polygon.
