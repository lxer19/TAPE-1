Reference-contexts: One can let A (!) coincide with ^ e '(!) on the interval [; ]. This will lead to the exact result in case the function f is band limited. A sampling theorem similar to the classical Shannon sampling theorem can then be proven <ref> [2] </ref>. Note that A (!) is not a trigonometric polynomial such that the scheme will be non local. The decay of the coefficients depends on the smoothness of A (!) as a 2 periodic function.

Reference-contexts: Recently several constructions of wavelet on an interval became available <ref> [4, 8, 12, 13, 29] </ref>. These constructions all have in common that the functions that are supported, in some sense, away from the endpoints correspond to the ones from the real line, while new basis functions are constructed near the boundary. <p> This assures that smooth sequences will have small wavelet coefficients which is one of the basic reasons why wavelets are suited for data compression. In <ref> [4] </ref> so called recursive wavelets are introduced. We explain the idea first on the real line. The V 0 space is here defined as the space of the functions that are piecewise constant on the intervals [k; k +1).

Reference-contexts: Comparing equations (8) and (11), we see that the degree of accuracy should be at least equal to N 1, otherwise the quadrature formula will ruin the asymptotic convergence order of the wavelet approximation. Quadrature formula for use in connection with multiresolution analysis were studied in <ref> [5, 36] </ref>. 3.2 Trapezoidal rule A simple quadrature formula is the trapezoidal rule, where Q [f (x)] = k In general the application of this rule is limited because it only has a degree of accuracy equal to one but here the following lemma holds: Lemma 6 If the scaling function <p> This formula was used in numerical analysis applications in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In fact one get exactly the same function starting from any pair of compactly supported biorthogonal scaling functions from [11] with N + e N = 4.

For more detailed treatments, one can consult <ref> [9, 15, 24, 26, 28] </ref>. A multiresolution analysis of L 2 (IR) is defined as a set of closed subspaces V j with j 2 ZZ that exhibit the following properties: 1. <p> Moreover in case its degree is less than N we will recover the function exactly since P 0 f (x) = f (x). This means we can reconstruct a polynomial from its samples. Such a method is usually referred to a as quasi-interpolating scheme <ref> [9] </ref>. In case the scaling function is compactly supported this property holds also locally. Evidently the asymptotic error estimates are only useful whenever one has the opportunity of increasing the sampling rate and when the underlying function is smooth.

A typical example are the B-splines of odd order, which are symmetric around an integer + 1=2, such that one can take t = 1=2.

Reference-contexts: Comparing equations (8) and (11), we see that the degree of accuracy should be at least equal to N 1, otherwise the quadrature formula will ruin the asymptotic convergence order of the wavelet approximation. Quadrature formula for use in connection with multiresolution analysis were studied in <ref> [5, 36] </ref>. 3.2 Trapezoidal rule A simple quadrature formula is the trapezoidal rule, where Q [f (x)] = k In general the application of this rule is limited because it only has a degree of accuracy equal to one but here the following lemma holds: Lemma 6 If the scaling function <p> Evidently, if t = M 1 , the degree of accuracy is equal to 1. In the case of orthogonal wavelets, the following lemma holds <ref> [36] </ref>: Lemma 7 If '(x) is an orthogonal scaling function with N &gt; 1, then the one point quadrature formula has a degree of accuracy equal to 2. Consequently it can be used in case N 6 3 without ruining the convergence rate. <p> This formula was used in numerical analysis applications in [5]. In the case of a multiple point formula, a general numerical scheme to find the shift and weights is described in <ref> [36] </ref>. 3.4 Remarks When using a quadrature formula we get the exact projection P 0 f (x) in case f is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to the degree of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The relationship (9) can then be written as ^ d (!) = ^-(!) ^p (!): This leads to the following result: 3 Lemma 3 The interpolation problem (9) has a unique solution if ^p (!) does not vanish. This technique was studied in <ref> [1, 3, 37] </ref>. A problem here is that 1=^p (!) is not a trigonometric polynomial and that thus each coefficient -l depends on all the data samples d k . This is evidently not very useful computation wise.
