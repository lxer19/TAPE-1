Abstract: We lay the foundation for ontological mediation as a method for resolving communication difficulties resulting from different ontologies. The notion of hierarchical relations enables a theory of orientation or direction of ontologies to be presented. We describe an ontologcial mediator as being able to think about (or conceptualize) concepts from ontologies and find equivalences between them. Algorithms for finding the meanings of unfamiliar words by asking questions are introduced and evaluated experimentally.

Reference-contexts: Work on pruning this sort of search is being considered. Meanwhile we plan to apply ontological mediation algorithms to other ontologies including the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <ref> (Humphreys and Lind-berg, 1993) </ref>. Mediating between two different ontologies, UMLS and WordNet will lead to new ideas for ontological mediation algorithms. Another experiment could involve human subjects, for example, those searching a database and are looking for just the right keyword to find some target.
