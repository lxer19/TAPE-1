Abstract: Most manufacturing processes involve several process variables which interact with one another to produce a resultant action on the part. A fault is said to occur when any of these process variables deviate beyond their specified limits. An alarm is triggered when this happens. Detection schemes based on threshold bounds often suffer from high false alarm and missed detection rates when the process measurements are not properly conditioned. They are unable to detect frequency or phase shifted fault signals whose amplitudes remain within specifications. They also provide little or no information about the multiplicity 1 or location 2 of the fault condition. A method of overcoming these limitations is proposed in this paper. The Haar transform is used to generate sets of detection signals from the original measurements of process monitoring signals. By partitioning these signals into disjoint segments, mutually exclusive sets of Haar coefficients can be used to locate faults at different phases of the process. The lack of a priori information on fault condition is overcomed by using the Neyman-Pearson criteria for the uniformly most powerful form (UMP) of the likelihood ratio test (LRT).

Reference-contexts: The development of the global detector is described in section 3 and the summary and conclusion are found in section 4. 2 The Haar Transform 2.1 The Continuous Haar Transform The Haar transform is a member of a class of nonsinusoidal orthogonal functions <ref> [1] </ref>. It consists of rectangular waves distinguished by time scalings and time shifts. The set of continuous Haar functions fh (r; m; t)g is periodic, orthonormal and complete, and was proposed by Alfred Haar in 1910.

Reference-contexts: The Haar transform is defined over the entire signal length, and its wavelet structure allows the detection of multiple faults occuring within the same press cycle. The Haar transform is also one of the most efficient transformation algorithms in terms of computational speed and memory usage <ref> [2] </ref>, [7], and thus ideal for implementation as an on-line monitoring system.

It can be performed in (2n 2) additions and subtractions and is considerably less than the n log 2 n multiplications for the fast Fourier transform.

While the more familiar orthogonal Fourier transform is ideal for sinusoidal narrow-band signals, the Haar transform is especially well-suited to represent spectrally wide-band signals [5] with step-like discontinuities. 3.

Reference-contexts: Thus i i = oe c i (13) For a given region of support, 0 p &lt; q &lt; 1, a subset of fh (r; m; t)g exists which spans the region [p : q]. Of these, an optimal subset of Haar coefficients <ref> [3] </ref> can be found which maximizes (12) and minimizes (13). 2.6 Moments of the Haar Coefficient A Haar coefficient is a linear combination of consecutive points in the original data. Its statistical properties are therefore dependent on the behavior of these points.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the more familiar orthogonal Fourier transform which uses complex exponentials as its basis functions and is ideal for sinusoidal narrow-band signals, the Haar transform is especially well-suited to represent spectrally wide-band signals <ref> [5] </ref>. Fault signatures which are frequency or phase shifted, and invisible to time domain control limits, can now be easily detected. The Haar transform is defined over the entire signal length, and its wavelet structure allows the detection of multiple faults occuring within the same press cycle. <p> Fast algorithms for computing the Haar transform can be found in [2], [7], [8]. 2. Signal Bandwidth. While the more familiar orthogonal Fourier transform is ideal for sinusoidal narrow-band signals, the Haar transform is especially well-suited to represent spectrally wide-band signals <ref> [5] </ref> with step-like discontinuities. 3. Data Reduction. The uncertainty of process repeatability makes it is undesirable to monitor the process at a particular fixed instant. The lower indexed Haar functions have large regions of support and are proportional to the signal averages over these regions.

Reference-contexts: Hence, higher-indexed Haar coefficients represent mostly noise and may be neglected resulting in a further reduction of data. 4. Measure of System Entropy. The complexity of a signal with respect to a given dis crete basis can be defined as the Shannon entropy of the basis expansion coefficients <ref> [6] </ref>. The Haar coefficients can be used to estimate the entropy of the system. 4 5. Isolation of Fault.

Reference-contexts: A UMP test must be as good as any other test for every m 1 and exists if and only if the LRT for every m 1 can be completely defined (including threshold) without knowledge of m 1 <ref> [9] </ref>. The existence of the UMP in the sense of the Neyman-Pearson criterion is proven in the following section. 3.2 Proof of Existence of the UMP Using the Neyman-Pearson criterion, the probability of false alarm is denoted by P F = ff, where ff is the prespecified level of significance.
