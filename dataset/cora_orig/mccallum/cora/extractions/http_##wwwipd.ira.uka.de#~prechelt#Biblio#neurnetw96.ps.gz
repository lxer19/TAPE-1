Abstract: 190 articles about neural network learning algorithms published in 1993 and 1994 are examined for the amount of experimental evaluation they contain. 29% of them employ not even a single realistic or real learning problem. Only 8% of the articles present results for more than one problem using real world data. Furthermore, one third of all articles do not present any quantitative comparison with a previously known algorithm. These results suggest that we should strive for better assessment practices in neural network learning algorithm research. For the long-term benefit of the field, the publication standards should be raised in this respect and easily accessible collections of benchmark problems should be built.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by this impression, I decided to investigate this hypothesis by studying the current research practice empirically. In a recent study of experimental evaluation in computer science publications, the journal Neural Computation had quite good results, far above average <ref> (Tichy, Lukowicz, Prechelt and Heinz, 1995) </ref>. However, the only measure used in that work was the fraction of article space devoted to the evaluation and the articles considered were not only those about learning algorithms.
