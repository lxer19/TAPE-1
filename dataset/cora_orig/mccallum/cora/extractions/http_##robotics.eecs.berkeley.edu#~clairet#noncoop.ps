Abstract: Next Generation Air Traffic Management will allow for the possibility of free flight, in which each aircraft chooses its own optimal route, altitude and speed. In a free flight environment, the trajectories of several aircraft may be conflicting, in which case aircraft may or may not cooperate in resolving the conflict. This paper presents a method for noncooperative conflict resolution in which each aircraft develops a resolution strategy for the worst possible actions (within known bounds) of the other aircraft. The resolution strategy is based on noncooperative game theory: the solution to the game partitions the state space of each aircraft into safe and unsafe sets which represent level sets of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and the control strategies are abstracted into discrete protocols within each partition. Two examples of conflict resolution using speed and heading changes are worked out in detail.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An area of great interest in the aviation community is that of free flight for future air traffic systems <ref> [1] </ref>. In a free flight environment, pilots would have the freedom to select their path and speed in real time, using, for example, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) as navigational tools instead of following indirect routes over the current Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) transmitters. <p> The unsafe sets of states are illustrated in Figure 7 for various values of r , and speed ranges as illustrated. 4 Conclusions In this paper, a conflict resolution strategy for free flight based Air Traffic Management is presented. A <ref> [1; 5] </ref> and r = =2, 0, =4, and =2. noncooperative method based on game theory is described, and two examples are presented to illustrate the methodology.

Reference-contexts: Communication between aircraft would exist in the near future with the proposed Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) <ref> [2] </ref>, in which each aircraft broadcasts to all other aircraft in its vicinity its current state as well as intent in the form of its next two proposed way points. State information about surrounding aircraft could also be provided by on-board radar. <p> The algorithms of this paper do not require any additional structure to the airspace than what currently exists. Each aircraft is surrounded by two virtual hockey pucks, the protected zone and the alert zone <ref> [2] </ref>, shown in Figure 1. A conflict between two aircraft occurs if the protected zones of the aircraft overlap. The radius and the height of the en-route protected zone is currently 5 nautical miles and 2,000 ft respectively.

Reference-contexts: In our work, we strive for an approach and a modeling scheme for which we can verify the safety of the conflict resolution method. We present in <ref> [8] </ref> a decentralized architecture for Air Traffic Management to use as a framework for our conflict resolution algorithms. In this framework, aircraft in en-route airspace are allowed to self-optimize in the spirit of free flight and coordinate with neighboring aircraft in order to resolve potential conflicts. <p> In our current research, we are extending the verification methodology of this paper to dynamic rather than kinematic models of the aircraft, with different flight modes. In a hierarchical flight vehicle management system, such as the one proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>, we have explained the role of dynamic models. Some preliminary results in this context have been presented in [15], [16].

Reference-contexts: The implicit switching control law derived from the saddle so lution to the game may be modeled by finite automata with differential equations associated with each state, and the resultant hybrid system is safe by design. Our safe set computation gives the same geometric solution to that of <ref> [12] </ref>, yet we work in the context of steady state solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The algorithms of this paper do not require any additional structure to the airspace than what currently exists.
