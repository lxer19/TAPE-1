Reference-contexts: Maintenance is an acute challenge to any effort to model organisational knowledge, since the modern organisation is the epitome of a changing, and strongly nondeterministic domain. Analysis of knowledge workers in the field <ref> (Kidd, 1994) </ref> shows that they perform many different roles that resist classification, and rarely conform to their official titles; they build up informal networks of communication that rarely conform to the organisational chart; project teams form and disband in the space of days.

Reference-contexts: The centrality of stories Once war stories have been told, the stories are artifacts to circulate and preserve. Through them, experience becomes reproducible and reusable. <ref> (Orr, 1990, p.156) </ref> War stories preserve and circulate hard-won information within the community. (p.157) What does it mean to become part of a group, to understand, share in, and contribute to its culture? Sociologists, particularly anthropologists and ethnographers such as Orr, point to the importance of stories in this process.

Reference-contexts: for management policy (appropriate questions can then be raised if there are concerns about the sufficiency of the representation or reasoning); the right to participate in any modelling of ones work domain. 6 At this early stage, it is hard to predict the implications of a truly established knowledge economy <ref> (Stefik, 1986) </ref> operating within and between organisations. The wide-ranging issues raised in this section are intended simply to open up the space of legitimate issues that should be of concern within the knowledge systems community.

Reference-contexts: Fischer et al. (1995) discuss the implications of multiple, often conflicting, domain models for knowledge-based support, and describe an approach and tools that can support multiple representations and incremental formalisation of domain concepts. The requirement to incrementally formalise has been identified from studies of designers using self-selected tools <ref> (Sumner, 1995) </ref>, and designers testing new design notations for capturing design rationale (i.e. design-specific organisational memory) (Buckingham Shum and Hammond, 1994). However, these issues are relevant to knowledge-intensive work of many types.
