Note: Finally, I thank my parents and my sister Hamsa (who I'm sure will be thrilled to see her name in print!) for all the support and encouragement they've given me.  
Abstract: I sincerely thank Dr. C. Pandu Rangan for having introduced me to the field of algorithms and for having suggested the various problems I have worked on. I am deeply indebted to him for his enthusiastic help, guidance and valuable advice, all of which made him much more than a project guide. Anand has been a wonderful friend and research collaborator I don't think I will ever forget the several hours (every day) we spent discussing various things (not just algorithms!), as well as the several days (every month) we spent trying to refine our half-baked solutions to various problems solutions where counterexamples were more the rule than the exception! All my classmates and several "Alakites" made my stay here an enjoyable and unforgettable one. Special thanks are due to Bobby, Cheeku, Has, Jyer, Kat and Veena for interesting discussions on numerous varied topics, and the help many of them gave me at various times. Kamakoti, Jayanth, Vamsi, Easwar and Kishore were very nice guys to work with in the TCS lab.

Reference-contexts: Two vertices u and v such that (u; v) 2 E are said to be adjacent to each other, or neighbours of each other. Common representations of graphs involve the specification of adjacencies in terms of adjacency lists and matrices <ref> [1] </ref>. A path is a sequence of distinct vertices v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . ; v k such that v i and v i+1 are adjacent for all 1 i &lt; k. A path from u to v is denoted by u v. <p> Step 2 takes linear time. Each iteration of steps 3 and 4 takes O (n 2 ) time, and so steps 3 and 4 require O (n 3 ) time. Step 5 takes O (n 3 ) time using the standard All Pairs Shortest Paths algorithm <ref> [1, 26] </ref>. Step 6 takes O (n 2 ) time because there are totally O (n 2 ) pairs of distances to be compared. Step 7 takes constant time. <p> In other words, a hanging is simply what is obtained upon doing a breadth first search (BFS) <ref> [1] </ref> of G, starting from vertex u. Define the interval , I (u; v), of two vertices u and v of a distance-hereditary graph G as follows. I (u; v) = fx : x lies on some shortest u v pathg.

Lemma 4.2 <ref> [4] </ref> A graph G is distance hereditary if and only if none of the con figurations shown in Figure 4.1, and C n ; n &gt; 4, is a subgraph of G. <p> Cographs are the class of graphs which contain no induced path 29 e e ee on four vertices (denoted by P 4 ). They are exactly the class of distance-hereditary graphs with diameter less than or equal to two <ref> [4] </ref>, and may be defined recursively starting from K 1 as follows: if G 1 and G 2 are cographs, so are their disjoint union and join (Chapter 1 defines these terms). Lemma 4.3 All cographs are distance-hereditary, and there are distance-hereditary graphs that are not cographs. Lemma 4.4 [4] All <p> two <ref> [4] </ref>, and may be defined recursively starting from K 1 as follows: if G 1 and G 2 are cographs, so are their disjoint union and join (Chapter 1 defines these terms). Lemma 4.3 All cographs are distance-hereditary, and there are distance-hereditary graphs that are not cographs. Lemma 4.4 [4] All distance-hereditary graphs can be obtained starting from K 1 by an application of the following operations: 1. Operation F A fraternal vertex split: Create a new vertex v similar to an existing vertex u such that N (u) = N (v), and (u; v) 62 E. 2. <p> This completes the proof. 2. Lemma 4.8 <ref> [4] </ref> For any vertex u, N k (u) is a cograph. Proof. If N k (u) had a P 4 , P , then by the previous lemma there is a vertex v in N k1 (u) adjacent to all the vertices of P . <p> Since (x; y) 62 E, there is a P 4 (x; t; w; y) in N k1 (u). This is not possible since, by Lemma 4.5, the induced subgraph on each level is a cograph. 2 The above lemma (due to Bandelt and Mulder) originally appeared in <ref> [4] </ref>, but the requirement that x and y be non-adjacent was not mentioned, which was an error. If they were adjacent, the statement wouldn't necessarily be true see 34 e ee x y v Lemma 4.10 Same conditions as in the previous lemma.

We present efficient linear algorithms for 39 both problems using the properties of separators; more precisely, by exploiting the manner in which minimal separators are connected with one another. <p> This approach has been used to solve the problem of computing the treewidth of a distance-hereditary graph as well. The previous best known algorithm for the connected domination problem was O (n 3 ) <ref> [11] </ref>; we have improved the complexity to O (m + n). We feel that this paradigm can be used to solve some other problems on distance-hereditary graphs, that are NP -complete on general graphs.

Reference-contexts: In other words, a graph is distance-hereditary if and only if every two vertices have the same distance in every connected subgraph containing both of them; alternatively, all induced paths in a distance-hereditary graph are isometric. Distance-hereditary graphs were first introduced by Howorka <ref> [22] </ref>. Further characterizations in terms of metric properties, forbidden subgraphs, separators and relationships 28 e e e e e e e e e with other graph classes have appeared in [4] and [11]. <p> We state below some important known facts about distance-hereditary graphs as lemmas. We don't formally prove all of them here, but sometimes refer the reader to the appropriate papers where these are proved. Lemma 4.1 <ref> [22] </ref> Distance-hereditary graphs are precisely the class of graphs in which every cycle on five or more vertices has at least two crossing chords. Here, two chords (u; v) and (w; z) cross if the vertices u; w; v; z are distinct and in this order on the cycle.

Reference-contexts: White, Farber and Pulleyblank [28] consider this problem on chordal graphs and some of its subclasses such as strongly chordal graphs. Various approximate and (exponential) exact algorithms are also known for this problem; see <ref> [24] </ref> for a survey. 10 In this thesis, we present polynomial-time algorithms for this problem on AT--free graphs and distance-hereditary graphs. On AT-free graphs, our approach is based on the properties of dominating paths, and we obtain an O (n 3 ) algorithm.

Reference-contexts: An asteroidal triple-free (AT-free) graph is a graph that contains no asteroidal triples. AT-free graphs were first considered by Lekkerkerker and Boland <ref> [25] </ref> in the early 1960s, when they introduced and studied the properties of interval graphs.The following facts about the AT-free graphs are well-known. Observation 3.1 AT-free graphs are not necessarily perfect. Consider C 5 , for example, which is AT-free but not perfect. <p> 3 [ P 1 &% e e e e 6 Homeomorphic to 3P 1 e e &% e e Homeomorphic to P 4 &% 6 Homeomorphic to C 3 e ee e ee Induced Observation 3.2 G is an interval graph if and only if it is chordal and AT-free <ref> [25] </ref>. Actually, an equivalent result states that a graph is interval if and only if it is chordal and cocomparability. Since AT-free graphs strictly contain the cocompa-rability graphs, this observation is stronger one way, and weaker the other. Observation 3.3 [9] Perfect AT-free graphs strictly contain the cocomparability graphs.

Reference-contexts: Step 2 takes linear time. Each iteration of steps 3 and 4 takes O (n 2 ) time, and so steps 3 and 4 require O (n 3 ) time. Step 5 takes O (n 3 ) time using the standard All Pairs Shortest Paths algorithm <ref> [1, 26] </ref>. Step 6 takes O (n 2 ) time because there are totally O (n 2 ) pairs of distances to be compared. Step 7 takes constant time.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to investigate if the same or similar techniques can be extended to obtain efficient algorithms for some other problems too. We mention here that we have solved the problem of computing the treewidth of distance-hereditary graphs <ref> [27] </ref> using an extension of the techniques presented in this Chapter. 47 Chapter 6 Concluding Remarks and Open Problems 6.1 Conclusions An important method of overcoming the intractable nature of problems in graphs is to focus attention on special classes of graphs and try to obtain solutions for them.

Reference-contexts: Connected domination is N P -complete for split and chordal graphs too, while polynomial-time algorithms are known for strongly chordal <ref> [28] </ref>, and permutation graphs [2, 8]. In this thesis, we present polynomial-time algorithms for the connected domination problem on two special classes of graphs AT-free graphs and distance-hereditary graphs. On AT-free graphs, our result generalizes the result of [2], but 8 uses a totally different method based on dominating paths. <p> We briefly review the current status of this problem on various classes. Arvind and Pandu Rangan [2] provide an O (m + n log n) algorithm for this problem on permutation graphs. White, Farber and Pulleyblank <ref> [28] </ref> consider this problem on chordal graphs and some of its subclasses such as strongly chordal graphs. <p> The method used to solve this problem is similar to that used to solve the M CDS problem in the previous section. It has already been observed that these two problems are algorithmically closely related <ref> [28] </ref> in the sense that they are either both polynomial or both NP-complete on all classes of graphs investigated so far. However, their precise relationship with each other is unknown. <p> This class is a proper superset of the class of AT-free graphs (e.g., C 6 belongs to this class, but is not AT-free). Our results also strengthen the conjecture in <ref> [28] </ref> that 26 the connected domination and Steiner set problems are algorithmically closely re-lated. <p> We feel that this paradigm can be used to solve some other problems on distance-hereditary graphs, that are NP -complete on general graphs. Our algorithms for connected domination and Steiner set on AT-free and distance-hereditary graphs strengthen the conjecture in <ref> [28] </ref> that these two problems are algorithmically closely related, in the sense that they have the same complexity status on any special class of graphs. 6.2 Open Problems We conclude this chapter by suggesting some related open problems and directions for future work.
