Title: Nonlinear Magnification Fields

Abstract: We introduce nonlinear magnification fields as an abstract representation of nonlinear magnification, providing methods for converting transformation routines to magnification fields and vice-versa. This new representation provides ease of manipulation and power of expression. By removing the restrictions of explicit foci and allowing precise specification of magnification values, we can achieve magnification effects which were not previously possible. Of particular interest are techniques we introduce for expressing complex and subtle magnification effects through magnification brushing, and allowing intrinsic properties of the data being visualized to create data-driven magnifications.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows an example of a transformation and its associated magnification mesh calculated with this method. This technique allows any nonlinear magnification sys tem to create a landscape representation of its implicit magnification with elevation-based shading.

We have already described significant differences between 3DPS <ref> [1] </ref> and our system in Section 2.1. In addition, 3DPS uses explicit foci to define the magnification, so that increasing complexity of the magnification function entails additional computation.

Reference-contexts: One of the goals of the current paper is to provide a more rigorous treatment of some of the issues which they raise, in particular the non-trivial magnification to transformation conversion for more than one dimension. Space-scale diagrams <ref> [3] </ref> are well suited for dealing with typical pan-and-zoom systems; however such systems do not share basic properties of nonlinear magnification systems, such as preserving a view of the global context.
