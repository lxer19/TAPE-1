Abstract: The Design of the All Terrain Viewer April 19, 1995 21 finally reaches the Root Viewer, which replaces the current top-level viewer. The Root Viewer calls Unmap on the top-level viewer, which recursively Unmaps and then checks in its child viewers (if any) to the Connection Managers cache. The Root Viewer then checks in its old Top-Level Viewer and installs the new viewer as discussed before. When the automatic inlining option is turned off, the HTML module will substitute a text link for the content of child viewers which are not loaded. In this case, the module can tell immediately that the link that was clicked on is the stub of an embedded document, and will install the new viewer as its child in the appopriate region of its display space.
