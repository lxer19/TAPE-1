Abstract: In recent years, several new architectures have been developed for supporting multimedia applications such as digital video and audio. However, quality of service routing is an important element that is still missing from these architectures. In this paper we consider a number of issues in QoS routing. We first examine the basic problem of QoS routing, namely, finding a path that satisfy multiple constraints, and its implications on routing metric selection, and then present three path computation algorithms for source routing and for hop-by-hop routing.

Reference-contexts: Source Routing and Hop-by-Hop Routing Source routing and hop-by-hop routing are the two basic routing architectures for data networks. Hop-by-hop routing is the common form of general-purpose routing in current networks while source routing is mainly used for network diagnosis and special policy routes <ref> [4] </ref>. We now examine their implications for - 9 - path computation for QoS routing. In source routing, a forwarding path is computed on-demand at the source and listed in the packet header. Packets are forwarded according to the path in the packet.

Reference-contexts: The packet header can be much smaller compared with source routing as the packets do not have to carry the full forwarding path. Hop-by-hop routing can use fully distributed computation algorithms <ref> [7] </ref> which has lower memory requirements for the routers. We believe that both source routing and hop-by-hop routing architectures have important roles to play in QoS routing. Since QoS requirements are diverse, it is difficult to specify a set of general requirements that can apply to most applications. <p> We will examine some issues in this area. g We will study the convergence speed of our algorithms after link or node failures, and work out a revised algorithm based on the diffusing computation approach suggested by Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [7] </ref>. g We will investigate approximation algorithms for metrics with NP-complete search problems, and carry out simulation experiments to evaluate their performance. 5. Acknowledgement We would like to thank Dr David S. Johnson (AT&T Bell Labs) invaluable help with the problem of NP-completeness, and anonymous reviewers for their useful comments.

Reference-contexts: Multiple Metrics Multiple metrics can certainly model a network more accurately. However, the problem is that finding a path subject to multiple constraints is inherently hard. Polynomial-time algorithms for the problem may not exist. A simple problem with two constraints called "shortest weight-constrained path" was listed in <ref> [8] </ref> as NP-complete but the proof has never been published. Jaffe [11] investigated this particular problem further and proposed two approximation algorithms that solve the problem in pseudopolynomial-time or polynomial-time if the lengths and weights have a small range of values. <p> First we show that 2 Additive Metrics Problem is NP-complete. It is easy to see that 2 Additive Metrics Problem NP. Since Partition is a well-known NP-complete problem <ref> [8] </ref>, we show Partition 2 Additive Metrics Problem to prove its NP-completeness.

The running time of such NP-complete problems for real-world network topologies is investigated in <ref> [15] </ref>. The problem in QoS routing is much more complicated since the resource requirements specified by the applications are often diverse and application-dependent. The computation complexity is primarily determined by the composition rules of the metrics.
