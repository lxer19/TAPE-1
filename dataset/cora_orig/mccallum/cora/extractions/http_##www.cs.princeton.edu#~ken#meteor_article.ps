Abstract: The usual way of designing a filter is to specify a filter length and a nominal response, and then to find a filter of that length which best approximates that response. In this paper we propose a different approach: specify the filter only in terms of upper and lower limits on the response, find the shortest filter length which allows these constraints to be met, and then find a filter of that order which is farthest from the upper and lower constraint boundaries in a mini-max sense. Previous papers have described methods for using an exchange algorithm for finding a feasible linear-phase FIR filter of a given length if one exists, given upper and lower bounds on its magnitude response. The resulting filters touch the constraint boundaries at many points, however, and are not good final designs because they do not make best use of the degrees of freedom in the coefficients. We use the simplex algorithm for linear programming to find a best linear-phase FIR filter of minimum length, as well as to find the minimum feasible length itself. The simplex algorithm, while much slower than exchange algorithms, also allows us to incorporate more general kinds of constraints, such as concavity constraints (which can be used to achieve very flat magnitude characteristics). We give examples that illustrate how the proposed and the usual approaches differ, and how the new approach can be used to design filters with flat passbands, filters which meet point constraints, minimum phase filters, and bandpass filters with controlled transition band behavior.

Reference-contexts: The necessary number and values of filter coefficients for which the frequency response remains within the prescribed limits are then determined. The limit approach was used in the earliest work on analog filter design more than 50 years ago. Cauer <ref> [1] </ref> designed analog filters to meet prescribed, limit type tolerance schemes using elliptic functions. It is possible to use the approximation approach to meet limit constraints and to use the limit approach described in this paper to solve approximation problems.

Reference-contexts: The Algorithm There are 4 different types of linear-phase filters. For both even and odd symmetry of the impulse response, we obtain linear phase with either even or odd number of coefficients. In Rabiner and Gold <ref> [17] </ref> it is shown that the frequency response for each of the 4 types of linear-phase filters has the form H () = e j 2 ) A () where the real-valued amplitude function A () is a weighted sum of trigonometric functions, where N is the length of the filter

Reference-contexts: complete the optimization when the original problem is infeasible.) This has the additional advantage of being useful for the final design when the length is known, and also does not interfere with the resolution of ties based on size of the pivot elements, which is important for numerical stability (see <ref> [19] </ref>). A special case arises unavoidably, however, when there are no constraints designated as optimized. In that case, h = 0 and DUAL is always infeasible.

Mode b) allows us to do things like find the best stopband rejection, while keeping passband ripple within limits.
