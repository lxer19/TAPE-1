Title: UW VLSI Chip Tester  
Author: Neil McKenzie 
Date: December 1, 1989  
Affiliation: University of Washington  
Abstract: We present a design for a low-cost, functional VLSI chip tester. It is based on the Apple Macintosh II personal computer. It tests chips that have up to 128 pins. All pin drivers of the tester are bidirectional; each pin is programmed independently as an input or an output. The tester can test both static and dynamic chips. Rudimentary speed testing is provided. Chips are tested by executing C programs written by the user. A software library is provided for program development. Tests run under both the Mac Operating System and A/UX. The design is implemented using Xilinx Logic Cell Arrays. Price/performance tradeoffs are discussed.

Reference-contexts: See Figure 6. In the XC3000 family of LCAs, each CLB contains two flip-flops and it computes any function of 5 10 Boolean variables, or two functions of 4 variables. The IOBs can be programmed as inputs, outputs, or bidirectional. Refer to <ref> [1] </ref>, chapter 2, for a more complete treatment of the LCA's internals. The LCA used in the UW Chip Tester is the XC3020, which has 64 IOBs 1 and 64 CLBs. The 3020 costs about $45. <p> LCAs are programmed in-circuit at power-on time. The bit stream that represents its circuit is clocked into the LCA in bit-serial fashion, using a two wire interface. This is LCA Slave Mode, as it is described in <ref> [1] </ref>, page 2-20. The LCA bit streams are stored on disk on the host computer. An application program is used to initialize the LCAs. The initialization takes less than 100 milliseconds; this is negligible compared to the time it takes to launch an application. <p> Since the Xilinx LCA is CMOS, it has limited current sinking ability. The 3020 has only two power and two ground pins. If many of its outputs switch simultaneously, some signal degradation could occur. According to <ref> [1] </ref>, a maximum of 32 outputs should switch simulateously.

Reference-contexts: In order to run tests o*ine from the CPU, the controller has an address counter, a loop counter and a delay counter. These counters are implemented using discrete TTL parts. In particular, 74LS693's are used which have buried registers (see <ref> [2] </ref>). These registers are used to store the counter's default value. This is useful for infinite loop mode, as the counters can be easily reloaded at the end of the loop in order to start over. The address counter provides addresses to the RAMs in local memory.

Reference-contexts: The tester code is written to be slot-independent; at boot time, the Mac determines what cards are installed and what slots they occupy. The low level package queries the operating system to determine the slot number of the tester interface card. Refer to <ref> [3] </ref> for further discussion of NuBus slot addressing methods. 6.2 Test package The test package contains a number of high-level constructs for creating test programs. There are two abstract data types that the test package uses: PinType and SignalType.

Reference-contexts: Functions with side effects (e.g. scanf ()) must not execute during both passes of an OFFLINE block to ensure portability. Further discussion of the test package is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. 17 7 Future work There is room for further experimentation with both the hardware and the software. One idea that we wish to implement is the four-vector queue for performing true speed testing.
