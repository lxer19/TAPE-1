Abstract: A key question in the definition of new services for the Internet is whether to provide a single class of relaxed real-time service or multiple levels differentiated by their delay characteristics. In that context we pose the question: is service priority useful in networks? We argue that, contrary to some of our earlier work, to properly address this question one cannot just consider raw network-centric performance numbers, such as the delay distribution. Rather, one must incorporate two new elements into the analysis: the utility functions of the applications (how application performance depends on network service), and the adaptive nature of applications (how applications react to changing network service). This last point is especially crucial; modern Internet applications are designed to tolerate a wide range of network service quality, and they do so by adapting to the current network conditions. Most previous investigations of network performance have neglected to include this adaptive behavior. In this paper we present an analysis of service priority in the context of audio applications embodying these two elements: utility functions and adaptation. Our investigation is far from conclusive. The definitive answer to the question depends on many factors that are outside the scope of this paper and are, at present, unknowable, such as the burstiness of future Internet traffic and the relative offered loads of best-effort and real-time applications. Despite these shortcomings, our analysis illustrates this new approach to evaluating network design decisions, and sheds some light on the properties of adaptive applications.

Reference-contexts: It can discard the packet, or it can play the packet and adjust the playback points of subsequent packets in the talkspurt. It is unclear in general which strategy is better. For the purposes of this study we adopt the latter strategy based on previous studies (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) that have observed correlations in packets with large delays and on our own simulations that have shown that late packets generally arrive in bursts; given the choice between discarding several packets or introducing some jitter, the latter seems preferable.

Reference-contexts: Determining the playback point for each packet is a key issue in the design of these applications. Any playback strategy can make use of timestamps in packets, such as those provided by the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [11] </ref>, to determine the relative send times of successive packets, and thus need not assume synchronized clocks at the sender and receiver. If the receiving application knows a priori the maximum possible delay experienced in the network it can buffer the first packet for this maximum before playing it.

Reference-contexts: Given this wide disparity in delay requirements, it seems only natural that one can increase the overall welfare by offering different levels of service. One can model this analytically (following a very similar model in <ref> [14] </ref>). In the following simple example with two kinds of applications we compare a network with two priority classes to one with a single class of FIFO service. Let U i denote the performance level, or utility, of application i as a function of average network delay. <p> For example, when considering other questions, such as whether or not the network should provide multiple levels of dropping pri ority, appropriate models of applications are needed. Conversely, if nothing else, this study has shown us that previous research (such as <ref> [14] </ref>) that models applications as rigid and does not take application adaptivity into account can lead to incorrect or misleading results. In the Internet, design analyses must incorporate the adaptive nature of applications.
