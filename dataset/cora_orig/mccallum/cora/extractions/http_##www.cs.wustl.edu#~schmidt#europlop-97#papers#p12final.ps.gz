Title: GOF patterns for GUI Design  
Author: James Noble 
Date: June 1, 1997  
Address: Sydney.  
Affiliation: MRI, School of MPCE, Macquarie University,  
Abstract: The Design Patterns book introduced twenty-three patterns for object oriented software design. These patterns are used widely, but only in their intended domain of software design. We describe how six of these patterns can be used for the conceptual design of graphical user interfaces. By using these patterns, designers can produce interfaces which are more consistent, make good use of screen space, and are easier to use.

Reference-contexts: That is, GUIs don't have pointers. Related Patterns Given that the first software pattern language was about user interface design <ref> [3] </ref>, it is quite surprising that so few patterns and pattern languages have been written for this domain. The tools and materials metaphor has been described in a pattern language, although the language concerns implementation as much as design [16].

Reference-contexts: The tools and materials metaphor has been described in a pattern language, although the language concerns implementation as much as design [16]. Pattern languages have also been written for designing essay based web sites [14] and form style windows <ref> [4] </ref>. Envoi We believe that many GOF patterns capture deep general properties of object oriented software design. This paper is an experiment to determine whether (and how well) the patterns appear in the related, but significantly different, domain of GUI design.

Reference-contexts: Netscape uses icons as virtual proxies for images which haven't been down loaded. Many web pages use small image thumbnails as proxies for larger images. See Also Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture also describes the Proxy pattern <ref> [5] </ref>. GUI Strategy Object Behavioural Intent Define a family of algorithms, and make them interchangeable. Problem An object uses several algorithms, each with its own interface and customisable parameters. The user needs to set the parameters for the algorithm they have chosen.

Reference-contexts: This translation highlights an important difference between the GOF domain and the GUI domain: GOF patterns can address the implementation of objects, while GUI patterns necessarily address only the interfaces of GUI objects <ref> [7] </ref>. For those patterns that are mainly concerned with interfaces, such as Proxy or Prototype, this makes little difference. For patterns where the main concern is encapsulation, such as Strategy, the corresponding GUI pattern brings out a secondary aspect of the pattern, such as factoring or locating objects.

Reference-contexts: We believe these patterns are orthogonal to other techniques for user interface design (such as walkthroughs, prototype, metrics, or visualisation), just as patterns for software development are mostly orthogonal to other software development techniques. 1 A GOF Pattern is a pattern from the Design Patterns book <ref> [8] </ref>, written by the so-called Gang of Four | Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides.

Reference-contexts: Introduction This paper presents six patterns for graphical user interface (GUI ) design (Prototype, Singleton, Adaptor, Composite, Proxy, and Strategy), each inspired by the GOF 1 pattern of the same name. These patterns have been used widely in GUIs beginning with the early work on the Star [10] and Smalltalk <ref> [9] </ref>, and we have illustrated these patterns with examples from more recent GUIs. To apply these patterns to GUI design, we have translated the GOF patterns from the domain of OO software design to that of GUI design.

Reference-contexts: Windows and Macintosh interfaces can be adapted to run under X, and vice versa. Web browsers adapt the WWW user interface to wide range of host interfaces. See Also A Legacy Wrapper is a more general form of this pattern <ref> [12] </ref>. GUI Composite Object Structural Intent Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Problem Many GUI objects are made up recursively of other GUI objects. For example, disks contain directories, and directories contain other directories and files.

Reference-contexts: The GUI is less consistent, because singletons can't be copied or deleted, A singleton is always present, occupying screen real estate. Known Uses The Macintosh and Windows95 GUIs use this pattern for several desktop icons. The VisualWorks Launcher <ref> [15] </ref> is a variant of singleton, since although it is created on startup, it can be deleted. See Also GUI Proxy can allow a Singleton object to appear to be in more than one place.
