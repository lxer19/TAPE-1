Abstract: Calibration of polarimetric imaging SARs using point calibration targets is discussed in this paper. The four-port network calibration technique [5] is used to describe the radar error model. The processor ambiguity function and the radar distortion matrices are then combined to form a generalized polarimetric ambiguity function. The polarimetric ambiguity function of the SAR is then found using a single point target, namely a trihedral corner reflector. Based on the resultant polarimetric ambiguity function, an estimate for the backscattering coefficient of the terrain is found using a modified version of the STCT technique [5]. A radar image recorded by the JPL aircraft SAR, which includes a variety of point targets, is used for verification of the new calibration method. The calibrated responses of the point targets are compared both with theory and responses based on the POLCAL technique [8]. Also, using a uniform area of the imaged scene, responses of a distributed target are compared using the modified STCT and POLCAL techniques.

Reference-contexts: Among the point-target calibration techniques, the generalized calibration technique by Whitt et al. [10] characterizes the distortion matrices of the receive and transmit antenna by using three calibration targets. In a similar technique by Barnes <ref> [1] </ref> the distortion matrices are obtained by using targets with specific scattering matrices. Although, in principle, these techniques can fully characterize the distortion matrices, they are very sensitive to target alignment and to precise knowledge of the theoretical values of the scattering matrices of the calibration targets.

Reference-contexts: In an imaging radar, the processor performs an operation on the received signal U pq (t) to retrieve the reflectivity of the scene, S 0 pq (x; y). One such operation is to pass the signal through a matched filter having an impulse response G fl c <ref> [2] </ref>, leading to an output U 0 Z Z S 0 2R 0 ! 2R By performing the integration with respect to time, the quantity (x; y; x 0 ; y 0 ) = t 2R 0 ! 2R known as the ambiguity function can be obtained.

Reference-contexts: Although, in principle, these techniques can fully characterize the distortion matrices, they are very sensitive to target alignment and to precise knowledge of the theoretical values of the scattering matrices of the calibration targets. A third calibration technique for point targets by Sarabandi, et al. <ref> [4] </ref> uses a sphere and any other depolarizing calibration target (scattering matrix of this target need not be known), and is therefore immune to errors caused by target orientation and lack of precise knowledge of the theoretical values of the calibration targets' scattering matrices.

Reference-contexts: To remove this drawback while maintaining insensitivity to orientation of the calibration target, a single target calibration technique (STCT) was recently developed <ref> [5] </ref>. The main thrust of this paper is to show how the point target calibration techniques can be applied to imaging SARs. In particular, the STCT will be employed here since it only requires one calibration target. <p> Excluding the propagation phase and amplitude factor, the measured scattering matrix of a target with real scattering matrix S is given by <ref> [5] </ref> U = RST " C 2 R h R h S T v C 2 T h # The complex quantities R p , T q are the receive and transmit channel distortions with p; q = v; h and C 1;2 are the antenna cross-talk factors.

Reference-contexts: To compare the absolute levels, the signatures are computed by summing over the same region that is used to sum the powers of the calibration target. The Stokes scattering operator <ref> [7] </ref> for each pixel in this region is summed. These results are given in Table 2. Note that generally the signatures do not as closely resemble a trihedral as did those when using just a single pixel.
