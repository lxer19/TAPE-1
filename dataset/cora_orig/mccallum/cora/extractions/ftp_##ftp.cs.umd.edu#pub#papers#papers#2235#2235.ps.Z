Title: FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION  
Author: BEN SHNEIDERMAN 
Address: College Park, MD 20742, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland,  
Abstract: This paper offers a set of goals for user interface development and then scenarios of future developments. The applications include home control, hypermedia, office automation, digital photography , collaborative meeting/classrooms, public access, professional workstations, and medical record-keeping. Also, predictions are made for some of the underlying technologies such as User Interface Management Systems, remote control, flexible search, display devices, and touchscreens.

Reference-contexts: These tools will have a profound effect on the pace of user interface developments because they provide approximately an order of magnitude increase in productivity where they can be applied. UIMSs will play a role quite similar to the Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) that emerged 15 years ago <ref> (Carey, 1988) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While prototypes with a few dozen nodes seem appealing, strategies for dealing with larger networks are needed. Hardware to permit rapid and continuous zooming/panning of large networks would help, but aggregation methods may be more effective or at least a useful complement <ref> (Conklin and Begeman, 1988) </ref>. The addition of still frame and full motion video creates a compeling hypermedia environment that designers are only beginning to exploit.

Reference-contexts: Voice mail will continue to expand and provide an appealing, more personal, easy-to-use, and accessible alternative. Electronic filing of correspondence and enhanced search capabilities seem within reach <ref> (Malone et al., 1986) </ref>. There are numerous P ersonal Information Managers that are suitable bases for such development (PC Magazine reviews, December 13, 1988) and the relevant hardware/software is improving steadily .

Reference-contexts: While many textbooks and previous implementations limited touchscreen resolution to the size of the user's finger, newer strategies enable pointing to single pixels <ref> (Sears and Shneiderman, 1989) </ref>. Instead of simply pointing to targets, users can now touch the screen surface to produce a small cursor above the center of their fingers. Then they can drag the cursor and when the placement is as desired, they merely lift-off their fingers to initiate action.

Reference-contexts: On a more complex plane, NASA is pursuing telescience to allow ground-based scientists to operate experiments or telescopes on orbiting laboratories <ref> (Sheridan, 1987) </ref>. In general, I expect tele-operations will become more productive and exciting than autonomously operating robots. T ele-operations offer the attraction of greater human control, more flexibility and the rewards and satisfaction of accomplishment.

Reference-contexts: APPLICATIONS In the past decade improved user interfaces have opened up the door to the widespread use of word processors for writing, spreadsheet software in accounting, computer assisted design for engineering, and desktop publishing plus graphics in organizational communications <ref> (Shneiderman, 1987) </ref>. Here are some predictions about which applications will be similarly expanded in the next decade. The first group of applications have personal impact such as home control, public access information resources, and medical record keeping. <p> This field is still new , but already it shows promise of becoming one of the major software classes such as operating systems, compilers, or database management systems. Progress is needed in dealing more effectively with visually-oriented direct manipulation interfaces <ref> (Shneiderman, 1987) </ref> Remote control - do it there, do it then An exciting opportunity exists in designing remote control mechanisms. The remoteness may be in space, that is, controlling equipment at different locations, or it may be remoteness in time, controlling equipment operations at future times.

Reference-contexts: Catalogs, diagnostic problemsolving guides, business procedures manuals, organizational guides, museum exhibits, encyclopedic sources, reference books, and cookbooks seem likely candidates for practical commercial 5 applications, but there is already lively activity among interactive fiction writers and visionary hypermedia designers who will tap the affective and emotional side <ref> (Slatin, 1988) </ref>. Hypertext authors are only beginning to come to grips with effective organizing principles that permit users to recognize the structure and contents. There is still much work to be done in improving the user interface for hypertext systems.
