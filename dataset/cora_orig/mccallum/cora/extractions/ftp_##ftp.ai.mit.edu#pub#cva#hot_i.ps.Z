Title: Transmitter Equalization for 4Gb/s Signalling  
Abstract: To operate a serial channel over copper wires at 4Gb/s, we incorporate an 4GHz FIR equalizing filter into a differential transmitter. The equalizer cancels the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by the skin-effect resistance of copper wire giving a frequency response that is flat to within 5% over the band from 200MHz to 2GHz even over wires with 6dB of high-frequency attenuation. All but the last stage of the transmitter operates at 400MHz. The transmitter output stage uses a stable 10-phase 400MHz clock to sequence an array of drivers that implement the FIR filter. This paper introduces the concept of digital-signal equalization, describes the system design and circuit design of our equalizing transmitter, and presents simulation results from a 4Gb/s 0.5 m m CMOS transmitter.

Reference-contexts: Narrow-band voice, video, and data modems have long used equalization to compensate for the linear portion of the line characteristics <ref> [LeeMes 94] </ref>. However, it has not been used to date in broadband short-distance digital signalling. We equalize the line using an 4GHz FIR filter built into the current-mode transmitter. The arrangement is similar to the use of Tomlinson precoding in a modem [Tomlin 71].

Reference-contexts: Several of our techniques are motivated by those described in <ref> [ManHor 93] </ref>. 4. A clocked receive amplifier with a 50ps aperture time is used to sense the signal during the center of the eye at the receiver. The availability of 4Gb/s electrical signalling will enable the design of low-cost, high-bandwidth digital systems. <p> The right panel illustrates the dynamics of the loop converging by showing the two signals that control delay during pow-erup. The feedback loop directly drives the currentsource bias voltage (bottom) and the load control voltage (top) is generated by a replica-bias circuit <ref> [ManHor 93] </ref>. The figure shows that the loop converges to a stable state after less than 250ns. Dout Dout+ (a) x4 i i+1 Dout+ Dout x2 x1 i i+1 L j Equalized 4Gb/s Signalling Dally and Poulton 5.

Reference-contexts: attenuation in more detail. 2.1 Skin depth determines line attenuation At high frequencies (above 100MHz), current is carried primarily on the surface of the conductor, dropping off to a value of e -1 at a depth of (1) where s is the conductivity of the material (5.8E7 mhos/m for copper) <ref> [Matick 69] </ref>.

The arrangement is similar to the use of Tomlinson precoding in a modem <ref> [Tomlin 71] </ref>. In a highspeed digital system it is much simpler to equalize at the transmitter than at the receiver, as is more commonly done in communication systems. Equalizing at the transmitter allows us to use a simple receiver that just samples a binary value at 4GHz.
