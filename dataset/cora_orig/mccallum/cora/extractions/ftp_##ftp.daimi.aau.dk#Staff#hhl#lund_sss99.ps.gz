Abstract: We have made a number of robot applications as children toys. The design principles behind these applications are based on different artificial intelligence techniques. One of our main principles is to go away from the traditional play scenario of two intelligent agents such as child and "intelligent" computer game to a physical reality of the second intelligent agent. Hence, the game consists of a child playing with a physical robot that can be manipulated to different performances. For instance, we constructed a physical model of the old, popular computer game Pacman, where the child is to navigate a semi-autonomous LEGO Mind-storms robot around in a labyrinth while avoiding two fully autonomous "ghost robots". In other cases, we extend the games to include three intelligent agents: child, robot, and computer game, and in some cases, we even have four intelligent agents to interplay: child, robot, computer, and "intelligent" room.

Reference-contexts: Our experience with children tells us, that they find changing the morphology of the robot simpler, and it allows the children to immediately observe the effect of their changes in the physical reality. Initially, we have implemented a couple of Braitenberg-type <ref> (Braitenberg 1984) </ref> controllers as the fixed control programs, and provided the children with around 6-10 different hardware modules that they can combine in order to develop new behaviours for their robot.

Reference-contexts: In this sense, the control system of the LEGO spider robot is a behavior-based system <ref> (Brooks 1986) </ref>. Young children have great joy in observing, touching and steering the LEGO robot spider, and often use a lot of time to investigate the walking behaviour. The wheeled robot models include a LEGO fire engine that children can steer towards a house and have to spray water into.

Reference-contexts: There was no central control of the wave, but it emerges from the interaction between small units of spectators with a local feedback control. RoboCup is an international initiative to promote artificial intelligence robotics and the task of robot soccer as a landmark project <ref> (Kitano et al. 1997) </ref>. As a land mark project, RoboCup differs from earlier artificial intelligence landmark problems, such as constructing an artificial chess player.

Reference-contexts: Another way to allow children to develop their own robots is by the Toybots approach <ref> (Lund et al. 1998) </ref>. The Toybots approach is an evolutionary robotics approach that develops robot controllers through an interactive genetic algorithm. Here, we allow children to "program" by selecting which robots should reproduce among a population of robots that are shown graphically on the computer monitor. <p> After the evolutionary process, the controller that the child has developed is downloaded to the physical LEGO robot. More details about this approach can be found in <ref> (Lund et al. 1998) </ref>. All these approaches put emphasis on the play with a physical model, either through the construction of models or by interaction/play in order to understand the functioning of the physical models.

Reference-contexts: We find that children can learn about the real world (including math, physics, engineering, real world systems) by working with robots when using a constructionism approach (Papert 1980), especially when using a guided construc-tionism approach rather than the unguided construc-tionism approach <ref> (Lund 1999) </ref>. In the guided construc-tionism approach, lectures/guidance and hands-on experience is combined in order to allow the students to learn about a subject. <p> Our educational experience shows us that if the artifact is virtual, then at least in a number of cases, students tend to use abstraction about different characteristics of the artifact abstractions that have no validity in reality! <ref> (Lund 1999) </ref> | see also (Miglino, Lund, & Cardaci 1999). Therefore, we believe that some subjects need to be taught in a way that puts emphasis on the child/student interacting with a physical entity. <p> Our educational experience shows us that if the artifact is virtual, then at least in a number of cases, students tend to use abstraction about different characteristics of the artifact abstractions that have no validity in reality!

Therefore, we believe that some subjects need to be taught in a way that puts emphasis on the child/student interacting with a physical entity. <p> For the robot soccer model, we constructed a stadium out of LEGO pieces, including stadium light, rolling commercials, moving cameras projecting images to big screens, scoreboard and approximately 1500 small LEGO spectators who made the "Mexican wave" as known from soccer stadiums (for more details, see <ref> (Lund et al. 1999) </ref>. These devices were controlled using the LEGO Dacta Control Lab system and the LEGO CodePilot system that allow programming motor reactions which can be based on sensor inputs. The wave of the LEGO spectators was made using the principle of emergent behaviour.
