Abstract: A scattered volumetric dataset is regarded as a sampled version of a scalar field defined over a three-dimensional domain, whose graph is a hypersurface embedded in a four-dimensional space. We propose a multiresolution model for the representation and visualization of such dataset, based on a decomposition of the three-dimensional domain into tetrahedra. Multiresolution is achieved through a sequence of tetrahedralizations that approximate the scalar field at increasing precision. The construction of the model is based on an adaptive incremental approach driven by the local coherence of the scalar field. The proposed model allows an efficient extraction of compact isosurfaces with adaptive resolution levels as well as the development of progressive and multiresolution rendering approaches. Experimental evaluations of the proposed approach on different scattered datasets are reported.

Reference-contexts: We are also studying and testing alternative multiresolu-tion models, that are still based on simplicial comlexes, but exhibit different hierarchical structures, and might be competitive with respect to the pyramidal model discussed here. A first model, whose basic principles have been presented in <ref> [1] </ref>, is based on a hierarchy of simplicial models described by a tree: each node in the tree corresponds to a simplicial model that refines (at a higher precision) the portion of data covered by a simplex in its parent node.

Reference-contexts: In a different paper [3], a tool is proposed, called Magic-Sphere, that applies the idea of "focus area" without dealing with the problem of "cracks". Following the approach carried on at Xerox Park <ref> [2] </ref>, MagicSphere has been designed as a generic 3D widget, that defines a spherical volume of interest in the data modeling space. Data contained in such a volume can be visualized with different modalities, according to suitable filters associated with MagicSphere.

Reference-contexts: A multiresolution representation is critical for the implementation of these tools. Unfortunately, rebuilding an isosurface from a multiresolution representation creates consistency problems [8]: for instance, possible "cracks" on the common boundary of the low and high resolution submeshes must be fixed.

Our model is basically a three-dimensional extension of the model introduced in [5] for the multiresolution representation of surfaces defined by bivariate scalar fields through triangulations. <p> A cell complex that admits one such ordering with respect to a viewpoint v is called acyclic with respect to v. Delaunay simplicial complexes are projective, and thus they are acyclic with respect to any viewpoint <ref> [4] </ref>.

We are currently developing an improved model, that avoids storing explicitly all layers of the pyramid, while keeping track of the history of the refinement through the Delaunay selector applied at the highest precision.

Reference-contexts: The vertex inserted at each iteration is the point that causes the maximum error in the approximation. This method is called the Delaunay selector and is a three-dimensional generalization of a refinement criterion proposed for the two-dimensional case in <ref> [6] </ref>. Let " be a tolerance value, let S be a finite set of points in IR 3 , and let f be a three-dimensional scalar field known at the points of S.

Reference-contexts: Simplicial complexes have been used to represent irregular volume datasets; a number of Volume Visualization techniques are well-suited for tetrahedralized datasets <ref> [7, 18, 23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this context, it is extremely useful to supply the user with tools to set a "focus area", and render the data accordingly to that selection. A multiresolution representation is critical for the implementation of these tools. Unfortunately, rebuilding an isosurface from a multiresolution representation creates consistency problems <ref> [8] </ref>: for instance, possible "cracks" on the common boundary of the low and high resolution submeshes must be fixed.

Reference-contexts: Mesh simplification has been the goal of a number of recent proposals which significantly reduce the mesh complexity through a post-processing filtering <ref> [9, 11, 17, 16] </ref>. A more general approach consists in using approximated representations of the dataset, defined on meshes at reduced resolutions, so as to allow fast visualization when exact precision is not needed. The idea is therefore to work on data simplification rather than on output simplification. <p> Given the three configurations, the MT lookup table, which consists of 16 entries, can be simply defined. The use of simplification techniques in isosurface fitting is very popular, as they decrease the cost of rendering by reducing the complexity of the meshes produced <ref> [9, 11, 17] </ref>. These solutions generally accept a loss in representation precision in order to reduce its size. If a multiresolution hyper-surface model is available, an alternative solution is to directly produce simplified meshes by applying MT to an approximated low resolution " i hypersurface model.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the difficult part of the algorithm is implementing procedure ADD VERTEX: such procedure must update the simplicial complex by maintaining the whole data structure consistent. A simple, yet efficient, procedure to update a tetrahe-dralization by inserting one new vertex has been proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>. Such procedure is based on a sequence of actions that modify the tetrahedralization only locally (face flips): each flip action consists in replacing one, two, or three adjacent tetrahedra with four, three, or two new tetrahedra, respectively. <p> Other face flips may be needed when the new point lies either on a triangular face or on an edge of . For further details on the triangulation procedure see <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Thus, the total contribution of procedure ADD VERTEX to the time complexity is O (n a N ), where n a is the total number of local actions performed. It has been proved in <ref> [10] </ref> that the expected value of n a to build a Delaunay tetrahedralization with O (n 2 ) tetrahedra is O (n 2 ). Thus, the total time complexity of the Delau-nay selector is bounded by O (n 2 N ).

Reference-contexts: An example is the use of the octree representation to speed up isosurface fitting [22]. A relevant problem in isosurface fitting is also the high complexity of output data: very large surface meshes are often produced when the Marching Cube technique <ref> [13] </ref> is applied to high resolution datasets.

An isosurface fitting algorithm can easily be derived as a simplification of the Marching Cubes (MC) algorithm <ref> [13] </ref>. MC was defined to fit isosurfaces on regular rectilinear cells: it is based on the classification of the value returned by function f on each vertex of the cell with respect to a threshold value q.
