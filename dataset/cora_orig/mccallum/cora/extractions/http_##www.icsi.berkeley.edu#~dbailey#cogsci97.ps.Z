Abstract: This paper presents an implemented computational model of lexical development for the case of action verbs. A simulated agent is trained by an informant giving labels to the agent's actions (here hand motions) and the system learns to both label and carry out similar actions. Computationally, the system employs a novel form of active representation and is explicitly intended to be neurally plausible. The learning methodology is a version of Bayesian model merging (Omohundro, 1992). The verb learning model is placed in the broader context of the L 0 project on embodied natural language and its acquisition.

Reference-contexts: Bailey solves this by incorporating the Jack <ref> (Badler et al., 1993) </ref> human simulation system as part of his model. A shortcoming of the standard view of lexical acquisition is that it provides no account of how a child learns to make use of the concepts she learns and the words that label them.

Reference-contexts: One motivation for x-schemas comes from motor control. Simple behaviors like grasping involve coordinated movement of a range of muscles in a stereotyped yet parameterized manner called a synergy <ref> (Bernstein, 1967) </ref>. At a higher level, motor control involves the coordination of such synergies and the accompanying perception and control. The concept of motor-schema, which pervades the literature on motor control, is a flow-chart like depiction of such activity patterns (e.g. Arbib (1987)).

Reference-contexts: One such principle is children's tendency to learn action verbs corresponding to their own actions before extending the meanings to others' actions (Huttenlocher et al., 1983)|thus the focus on motor schemas. Another principle is that learning occurs without explicit negative evidence. Third, the principle of fast mapping <ref> (Carey, 1978) </ref> notes that children often learn to use a word sensibly after as little as one observation of its use. Our solution relies on the intimate relation between x-schemas and the passive linking f-struct.

Reference-contexts: Focal clusters, which in the shruti reasoning system represent assertions and queries of predicates plus their arguments, are extended to trigger and coordinate primitive synergies plus their parameters. A connectionist account of the model-merging algorithm has been sketched in the framework of recruitment learning <ref> (Feldman, 1982) </ref>. Binder nodes represent the conjunction of lexical item, motor parameters and world state features which make up a word sense.

Reference-contexts: The L 0 group at ICSI and UC Berkeley has been pursuing this research strategy for almost a decade <ref> (Feldman et al., 1996) </ref>. This paper is an overview of our recent results and challenges. From our perspective, modeling lexical development is an ideal task for studying embodied cognition. We can isolate linguistically and conceptually simple situations and construct and test detailed models.

Reference-contexts: Since Petri nets involve only local control, x-schemas could be straightforwardly modeled using connectionist units to represent places and transitions|if it weren't for the complication of passing parameters. A solution to this problem has been developed <ref> (Grannes et al., 1997) </ref> using a temporal synchrony approach to binding. Focal clusters, which in the shruti reasoning system represent assertions and queries of predicates plus their arguments, are extended to trigger and coordinate primitive synergies plus their parameters.

Reference-contexts: Several principles from the literature are incorporated into the learning model. One such principle is children's tendency to learn action verbs corresponding to their own actions before extending the meanings to others' actions <ref> (Huttenlocher et al., 1983) </ref>|thus the focus on motor schemas. Another principle is that learning occurs without explicit negative evidence. Third, the principle of fast mapping (Carey, 1978) notes that children often learn to use a word sensibly after as little as one observation of its use.

Reference-contexts: It also provides an explanation for children's ability to learn typological patterns such as verbs' tendency to encode manner (English) vs. path (Korean), although this feature is not discussed here. Yet, the model has several shortcomings. It offers no account of the radial category structure connecting word senses <ref> (Lakoff, 1987) </ref>. Nor does it explain how x-schemas might interact with image schemas such as Regier's to model phrases like push through. An account of x-schema learning and how it relates to lexical learning would also be desirable.

Reference-contexts: The concept of motor-schema, which pervades the literature on motor control, is a flow-chart like depiction of such activity patterns (e.g. Arbib (1987)). We currently represent x-schemas using a formalism known as Petri nets in computer science <ref> (Murata, 1989) </ref>. Their most important features are clean ways to capture concurrency and event-based asynchronous control in addition to the standard ideas of sequence, hierarchy and parameterization. A Petri net is a bipartite graph containing places (drawn as circles) and transitions (rectangles).

Reference-contexts: There are many ways of doing this in the computational learning literature. One way that won't suffice is the standard back-propagation used by Regier and the PDP modelers, since we require that the learning technique produce invertible solutions. Our current experiments use a version of Bayesian model-merging <ref> (Omohundro, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Lexical development is an active field with its own methods and results. One critical empirical finding is that the child's first words label not only things, but also relationships, actions and internal states <ref> (Tomasello, 1995) </ref>. Only by addressing the broader lexical acquisition problem can one appreciate the role of embodiment. In this paper, we will focus on the learning of verbs describing simple hand motions such as push and yank.
