Title: A General Purpose Proxy Filtering Mechanism Applied to the Mobile Environment  
Author: Bruce Zenel Juno Online Services, L.P. Dan Duchamp 
Affiliation: AT&T Labs Research  
Abstract: In recent years, proxies have become more prevalent. Generally, these systems are used to process data flowing between two endpoints using an intermediary. More specifically, they can be used to filter or process traffic flowing to and from a network-limited host. Benefits include more efficient use of network resources, reduced cost, and increased security. In this paper, we describe the design and capabilities of such a system, how it has been applied to the mobile environment, and provide an evaluation of the work.

Reference-contexts: Most of the issues are related to how the congestion control algorithm used by TCP is not valid in the weakly connected environment. Most solutions improve TCP performance at the cost of breaking TCP's end-to-end semantics. An alternative solution investigated by Balakrishnan et. al. <ref> [1] </ref> at Berkeley propose the use of an intermediary that snoops TCP conversations, but does not break the end-to-end semantics. <p> The latency introduced by the error insertion mechanism was negligible. Inserted errors were exponentially distributed around a particular mean value. This error model was chosen primarily so that the results could be compared with those in <ref> [1] </ref>, from which the TCP filter is derived. Testing was performed using a simple TCP client and server; throughput measured was the amount of data received by the client. <p> At the 8K mark, even though the performance of the TCP Proxy is beginning to drop, it is performing more than 4 times as well as the Baseline case. Comparing these results to those found in <ref> [1] </ref>, we see the same basic curves, with the TCP Proxy (called Snoop in their paper) performing better than standard TCP as the error rate increases. 4.2 Qualitative Analysis Qualitative evaluation was less precise, we looked at various issues and how we either solved them or decided they could not be

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this type of filtering is rather coarse; all image data will be filtered, which may include material that might be of interest to the user. * NFS: Network File System protocol The NFS <ref> [25, 2] </ref> protocol is a UDP based RPC protocol used for stateless file transfer. Within the environment that our system exists, an NFS client on the Mobile Host makes NFS requests to servers within the wired network. Most requests are NFS READ requests, which return file data to the MH.

Reference-contexts: Examples include firewalls [12], protocol specific proxies [10], programmable routers [26], and gateways that reduce traffic over low bandwidth or heterogeneous network links <ref> [3, 18] </ref>. As part of our research on mobile computing, we have spent two years building a general purpose proxy system. <p> Accordingly, we have designed and implemented an NFS filter specifically to handle NFS READ requests and replies. * TCP: Transport Control Protocol A number of problems (and solutions) with the TCP protocol in the weakly connected environment have been raised <ref> [3, 29, 11] </ref>. Most of the issues are related to how the congestion control algorithm used by TCP is not valid in the weakly connected environment. Most solutions improve TCP performance at the cost of breaking TCP's end-to-end semantics.

Therefore, it is desirable to use a protocol suited to the current network environment. <p> To remove a filter, the proxy-client connection is closed and the proxy endpoint of the original connection is moved back to the client. Once again, the server notices no change. The High Level Proxy mechanism relies heavily on socket mobility, which was first developed by Bakre and Badrinath <ref> [5] </ref>. In addition, the kernel running on the Proxy Server has been modified to allow filters to bind to sockets having an IP address of their associated Mobile Host.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we looked at applications and protocols that perform poorly in the mobile environment. These include: * HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The HTTP [7] protocol is used by most HTML <ref> [6] </ref> browsers to transfer data from an HTTP server to a browser. In an HTTP transaction, the client (browser) makes a request for a document, which is returned by the server using the same connection.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is two-fold. First, the routing system described in Section 2.1 ensures that the proxy can be placed on a trusted host. Second, we use a two-party authentication scheme from the KryptoKnight <ref> [8] </ref> protocol suite to authenticate the proxy and the mobile host to each other. Once authenticated, control information passed between the proxy and mobile host is encrypted.

Reference-contexts: An email header can contain all sorts of information, some of which may be considered superfluous. There are many image and voice standards, such as MIME <ref> [9] </ref>, that are used to encode voice/image data within an email message. To the mobile user, these images may be considered a waste of bandwidth if the image data is nothing more than a picture of the sender.

Reference-contexts: Actions a proxy filter might take include: * Run an optimized protocol between itself and the mobile host. An example is the Low Bandwidth X (LBX) protocol <ref> [15] </ref>, a compressed version of X11 [24]. * Selectively drop structured data. Examples are frames in an MPEG data stream, and superfluous header information in Email. * Compress data instead of dropping it.

Reference-contexts: A proxy facilitates this by implementing a single logical connection between endpoints as two physical connections, one between the proxy and each of the two end points. * More generally, through use of emerging mobile code models such as Java <ref> [16] </ref>, a proxy can enable a highly dynamic approach to trading off computation and communication. Applications can be split, and computation performed nearer to or farther from the server as conditions dictate. These advantages can be achieved without the use of proxies. <p> These filters are controlled primarily by applications executing on the Mobile Host. The filters are in effect mini-applications, and will be referred to interchangeably as applets (applet term originates from <ref> [16] </ref>). The Proxy Server (PS) has been realized as a process executing on the PMSR. Depending on the applet execution environment, there may actually be one or more Proxy Servers running.

Reference-contexts: In the world of stationary hosts, a simple solution can be provided by using static routes that force data between the two hosts to follow a strict path. When mobile hosts are considered however, the problem becomes complicated. The Columbia Mobile IP Protocol (MICP) <ref> [17] </ref> supports host mobility by changing the path that the data takes depending on the location of the mobile host (MH). This is accomplished by keeping track of the location of the MH and using Mobile Support Routers (MSR) to direct data to its current location.

Bandwidth reduction can be accomplished by discarding intermediate MPEG frames based on some criteria. The criteria to be used for filtering decisions is the amount of network bandwidth currently available.
