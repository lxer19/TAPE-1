Reference-contexts: Our auction server uses the former method because the latter is not incentive compatible: it falls prey to demand reduction lies by the bidders <ref> [ Ausubel and Crampton, 1996 ] </ref> . For multi-item auctions (with one or more units per item), the Groves-Clarke mechanism, discussed earlier, is the appropriate generalization of the Vickrey auction.

Reference-contexts: To allow an efficient allocation to be reached, it would be desirable to extract truthful valuation revelations as the bids to the auctioneer. Bidding truthfully can be made incentive compatible (a dominant strategy) by using the Groves-Clarke mechanism <ref> [ Groves, 1973, Clarke, 1971 ] </ref> . This means that each bidder is motivated to bid truthfully irrespective of what the others bid. This renders counterspeculation unnecessary. The Groves-Clarke mechanism can be applied to the combinatorial auction setting as follows.

Reference-contexts: This cannot be done in general in polynomial time in the number, n, of bids received, unless P = N P: Proposition 2.1 Winner determination is N P-complete. Proof. Winner determination is weighted set packing, and set packing is N P-complete <ref> [ Karp, 1972 ] </ref> . 2 Even approximate winner determination is hard if one is interested in worst case guarantees: Proposition 2.2 No polytime algorithm can guarantee an allocation within a bound 1 n 1* from optimum for any * &gt; 0 (unless N P equals probabilistic polytime).

Reference-contexts: These features are now discussed in order. 2.1 Combinatorial auctions In a sequential auction, items are auctioned one at a time. If a bidder has preferences over bundles, i.e. combinations of items (as is often the case 2 e.g. in electricity markets, equities trading, bandwidth auctions <ref> [ McAfee and McMillan, 1996, McMillan, 1994 ] </ref> , and transportation exchanges [ Sandholm, 1993 ] ), then bidding in such auctions is difficult. To determine her valuation for an item, the bidder needs to guess what items she will receive in later auctions.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a contract may have too low expected payoff ex ante, but in some realizations of the future events, it may be desirable. Contingency contracts have been suggested for utilizing the potential provided by future events among self-interested agents <ref> [ Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . The contract obligations are made contingent on future events. In some games this increases the expected payoff to both parties compared to any full commitment contract. However, contingency contracts are often impractical because the space of combinations of future events may be large and unknown.

Reference-contexts: A shorter representation of preferences without loss of expressive power could be possible by allowing a richer input language. One idea toward this direction was presented early on by Rassenti et al <ref> [ Rassenti et al., 1982 ] </ref> . They allowed the bidder to place combinational bids and to state the maximal number of combinations that could be accepted. An XOR-bid is a special case of this where that number is one.

Reference-contexts: Our auction server supports a variety of combinatorial auctions. The following subsections discuss some of them. 3 2.1.1 OR-bids In the combinatorial auction setting that has been most commonly discussed <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1998 ] </ref> , each bidder can bid on combinations of indivisible items, and her bids are joined with non-exclusive OR, meaning that any number of her bids can be accepted. <p> Polynomial time winner determination can be achieved by restricting the combinations on which the agents are allowed to bid <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1998 ] </ref> . However, because the agents may then not be able to bid on the combinations 4 they want, similar economic inefficiencies prevail as in the non-combinatorial auctions. We recently generated another approach to optimal winner determina tion.

Reference-contexts: However, contingency contracts are often impractical because the space of combinations of future events may be large and unknown. Also, when events are not mutually observable, the observing agent can lie about what transpired. Leveled commitment contracts are another method for capitalizing on future events <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1996 ] </ref> . Instead of conditioning the contract on future events, a mechanism is built into the contract that allows unilateral decommitting. This is achieved by specifying in the contract the level of commitment by decommitment penalties, one for each agent. <p> a given contract One concern is that a rational agent is reluctant in decommitting because there is a chance that the other party will decommit, in which case the former agent gets freed from the contract, does not have to pay a penalty, and collects a penalty from the breacher. <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1996 ] </ref> showed that despite such insincere decommitting the leveled commitment feature increases each contract party's expected payoff, and enables contracts in settings where no full commitment contract is beneficial to all parties.

Reference-contexts: The second-price (Vickrey) auction charges the winning bidder the price of the second highest bid. Under certain restrictions <ref> [ Sandholm, 1996 ] </ref> , it is each bidder's dominant strategy to bid her true valuation [ Vickrey, 1961 ] . The multi-unit Vickrey auction is a generalization of the Vickrey auction to settings with multiple units of an item, or in other words, multiple indistinguishable goods.

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage of these third party escrow companies like i-Escrow Inc. and Trade-Direct is the cost of running such an intermediary, which is recovered as fees currently about 5% of the contract price from the contract parties. A method to tackle this problem without third parties was developed by <ref> [ Sandholm, 1997 ] </ref> . The exchange is divided into chunks where each party delivers a small amount at a time, and the exchange proceeds with such alternation.

Reference-contexts: The proof is based on [ Hastad, 1999 ] , and we present it in <ref> [ Sandholm, 1999 ] </ref> . <p> If the bids exhibit special structure, better approximations can be achieved in polynomial time [ Chandra and Halldorsson, 1999, Halldorsson, 1998, Hochbaum, 1983, Halldorsson and Lau, 1997 ] , but even these guarantees are so far from optimum that they are irrelevant for auctions in practice <ref> [ Sandholm, 1999 ] </ref> .
