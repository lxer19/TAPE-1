Abstract: Dynomite is a portable electronic notebook that merges the benifits of paper note-taking with the organizational capabilities of computers. Dynomite incorporates four complementary features which combine to form an easy to use system for the capture and retrieval of handwritten and audio notes. First, Dynomite has a paper-like user interface. Second, Dynomite uses ink properties and keywords for content indexing of notes. Third , Dynomites properties and keywords allows retrieval of specific ink and notes. The user is shown a view, or a subset of the notebook content, that dynamically changes as new information is added. Finally, Dynomite continuously records audio, but only permanently stores highlighted portions so that it is possible to augment handwritten notes with audio on devices with limited storage.

Reference-contexts: However, since Dynomite is intended to run on mobile devices which do not have much storage, only those portions of the audio highlighted by the user are stored permanently. Degen et al. <ref> [2] </ref> designed an audio-only device that also uses audio marking. The audio toolbar (at the top of Figure 1) provides a visual display of the entire audio recording and the highlights within this period. During recording, users can mark new highlights using a button or gesture.

Reference-contexts: Another constraint on our design is that handwriting recognition is neither fast nor accurate and therefore distracts the user from the task at hand. Thus our system uses digital ink without interactive recognition. Consequently, in contrast to systems whose main input is text and whose index is keywords <ref> [ 3] </ref>, we also provide indexing of the ink itself. As stated above our first design goal was to match the ease of use of paper notebooks.
