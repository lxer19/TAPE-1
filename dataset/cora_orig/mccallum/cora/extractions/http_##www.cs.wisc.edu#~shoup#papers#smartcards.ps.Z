Title: Session Key Distribution Using Smart Cards

Affiliation: Bellcore,  
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a method by which smart cards can be used to enhance the security of session key distribution in the third-party setting of Needham & Schroeder. We extend the security model of Bellare & Rogaway to take into account both the strengths and weaknesses of smart card technology, we propose a session key distribution protocol, and we prove that it is secure assuming pseudo-random functions exist.

Reference-contexts: Faced with such a powerful adversary, the goal of a session key distribution protocol is basically to prevent the adversary from obtaining any information about session keys that it should not "obviously" have. In the important paper of Bellare & Rogaway <ref> [1] </ref>, these notions were for the first time properly formalized, and a protocol was presented and proved secure, assuming the existence of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) [2]. Many papers have addressed the session key distribution problem, and we refer the reader to [1] for more references and a discussion of its history. <p> In the important paper of Bellare & Rogaway <ref> [1] </ref>, these notions were for the first time properly formalized, and a protocol was presented and proved secure, assuming the existence of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) [2].

At system initialization, a security parameter k is specified, along with some number n of hosts.

Reference-contexts: We of course allow this as a possibility, but require that session keys unrelated to this host are still secure. We shall formalize the above security model, and present a protocol that is secure in this model. We build on the work of Leighton & Micali <ref> [3] </ref>, designing a protocol in which the server is essentially just another smart card, and in which access to the server is required only the first time a process on one host talks to a process on another host. <p> This protocol is a modification and extension of one proposed by Leighton & Micali <ref> [3] </ref> before the Bellare-Rogaway security model was proposed, and indeed, no formal statements about security are claimed or proved in that paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Let us recall the basic session key distribution problem in the third-party setting of Needham & Schroeder <ref> [4] </ref>. We have a server and a set of hosts, all of which contain secret keys. During the course of the protocol, on each host several processes attempt to establish session keys with processes on other hosts. The processes communicate with each other and with the server.
