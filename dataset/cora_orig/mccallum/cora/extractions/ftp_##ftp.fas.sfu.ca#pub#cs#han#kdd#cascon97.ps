Abstract: A data mining system, DBMiner, has been developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases and data warehouses. The system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions, including characterization, comparison, association, classification, prediction, and clustering. By incorporating several interesting data mining techniques, including OLAP and attribute-oriented induction, statistical analysis, progressive deepening for mining multiple-level knowledge, and meta-rule guided mining, the system provides a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment with good performance.

Reference-contexts: When a cube structure is quite sparse, the sparse cube technology <ref> [1, 18] </ref> should be applied to compute and store sparse cube efficiently. Both data structures have been implemented in the evolution of the DBMiner system: the 4 Characterizer generalized relation structure is adopted in version 1.0, and a multi-dimensional data cube structure without using sparse cube technology in version 2.0.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, interactive drill-down and roll-up can be performed synchronously in both target class and contrasting class (es) in a similar way as in characterization. These functions have been implemented in the discriminator. 4.4 Multiple-level association Based on many studies on efficient mining of association rules <ref> [2, 17, 8] </ref>, a multiple-level association rule miner (called "associator") has been implemented in DBMiner. An output of the as-sociator is shown in Figure 5. Different from mining association rules in transaction databases, a relational associator may find two kinds of associations: inter-attribute association and intra-attribute association. <p> Since the nested tuples (or values) can be viewed as data items in the same transaction, the methods for mining association rules in transaction databases, such as <ref> [2, 8] </ref>, can be applied to such transformed relations in relational databases. The multi-dimensional data cube structure facilitates efficient mining of multi-level, inter-attribute association rules.

Different from the study by [16] where a meta-predicate may match any relation predicates, deductive predicates, attributes, etc., we confine the match to only those predicates corresponding to the attributes in a relation. One such example is illustrated as follows. Example 3.

For example, a meta-rule "P (x; y) !
