Title: Estimating L 1 Error of Kernel Estimator: Monitoring Convergence of Markov Samplers  
Author: Bin Yu 
Keyword: KEY WORDS: fi-mixing; Diagnostic; Normalization constant.  
Note: referees for their very helpful comments.  
Abstract: In many Markov chain Monte Carlo problems, the target density function is known up to a normalization constant. In this paper, we take advantage of this knowledge to facilitate the convergence diagnostic of a Markov sampler by estimating the L 1 error of a kernel estimator. Firstly, we propose an estimator of the normalization constant which is shown to be asymptotically normal under mixing and moment conditions. Secondly, the L 1 error of the kernel estimator is estimated using the normalization constant estimator, and the ratio of the estimated L 1 error to the true L 1 error is shown to converge to 1 in probability under similar conditions. Thirdly, we propose a sequential plot of the estimated L 1 error as a tool to monitor the convergence of the Markov sampler. Finally, a 2-dimensional bimodal example is given to illustrate the proposal, fl Bin Yu is Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3860.
