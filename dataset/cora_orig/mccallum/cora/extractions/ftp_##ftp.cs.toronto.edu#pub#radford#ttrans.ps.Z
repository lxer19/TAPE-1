Abstract: Technical Report No. 9421, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently-developed method of "simulated tempering", the "tempered transition" method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that unfortunately is cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are "deceptive".

Reference-contexts: These normalizing constants will generally be estimated using preliminary runs, a process that can be tedious and time-consuming. Two other methods have also been proposed for sampling from multimodal distributions. 2 The multicanonical method <ref> (Berg and Celik 1992) </ref> can be viewed as an elaboration of simulated tempering in which the temperature parameter is eliminated by explicit summation. Its properties are similar to those of simulated tempering; in particular, it too explores via a random walk, and requires preliminary estimates for normalization constants.

Reference-contexts: Its properties are similar to those of simulated tempering; in particular, it too explores via a random walk, and requires preliminary estimates for normalization constants. Metropolis-coupled Markov chains <ref> (Geyer 1991) </ref> maintain state variables for each interpolating distribution (temperature). These states are updated using both transitions operating on each state independently, and transitions that may swap states at adjacent temperatures. <p> The answers to the first three questions determine the speed of sampling, which is perhaps the most important characteristic for most problems. In this respect, simulated tempering and tempered transitions have the advantage over Metropolis coupled Markov chains <ref> (Geyer 1991) </ref>. However, the latter method is the only one that produces good estimates of normalization constants without requiring preliminary estimates to start.

Reference-contexts: In the initial stages, some of the observed frequencies q i may be zero, in which case some extrapolation is necessary. Various other elaborations of the estimation procedure are also possible <ref> (Geyer and Thompson 1994) </ref>. This process of finding suitable weights for the distributions used in simulated tempering can be tedious and time-consuming. <p> Simulated tempering also allows use of "regenerative" simulation methods <ref> (Geyer and Thompson 1994) </ref>, though it is unclear whether these provide any real advantage. The trade-offs evident in the above comparison prompt one to wonder whether it is possible to devise a tempered sampling scheme that combines all or many of the advantages of the various present schemes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using Markov chains have long been used in statistical physics, and have recently become popular in Bayesian inference <ref> (for reviews, see Kennedy 1990, Smith and Roberts 1993, Neal 1993) </ref>. These methods encounter problems when the distribution to be sampled has isolated modes, which the Markov chain moves between only rarely.

Reference-contexts: One approach to sampling from such a multimodal distribution is to run the sampling 1 procedure several times, with different random number seeds, in the hopes that differ-ent runs will end up in different modes. Simulated annealing <ref> (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, and Vecchi 1983) </ref> is sometimes used within each run in an attempt to avoid finding modes with low total probability.

Reference-contexts: This remains true even when simulated annealing is used. Annealing may, however, reduce the magnitude of this discrepancy, provided the distribution at a high temperature is a good guide to the distribution at the lower final temperature. In contrast, the method of simulated tempering <ref> (Marinari and Parisi 1992, Geyer and Thompson 1994) </ref> is guaranteed to sample from the correct distribution, given enough time. <p> In the simulated tempering method <ref> (Marinari and Parisi 1992, Geyer and Thompson 1994) </ref>, a Markov chain is defined whose states consist of both a value for x and an index, i, of one of the distributions in the series.
