Abstract: An evolutionary tree, or phylogeny, is a tree without degree two vertices whose vertices are labelled by species. An ordinal assertion, in an evolutionary context, is a statement of the form "species a and b are as similar as species c and d" and is supported by a distance matrix M of evolutionary data if M[a; b] M[c; d]. Many phylogenetic inference methods commit to the assumption that the observed evolutionary dissimilarity M[s; t] approximates the true evolutionary dissimilarity d T (s; t). However, when M is derived from sequence comparison this assumption can lead to erroneous inferences. A more plausible assumption is that ordinal assumptions supported by the true phylogeny T are also supported by the observed evolutionary dissimilarities M . A phylogeny T is an ordinal representation of the distance matrix M if for all species a, b, c and d labelling T Ordinal representations are interesting from an evolutionary perspective since they represent ordinal assertions supported by observed data. Ordinal representations are equally interesting from a combinatoric perspective as their analysis is rich in structure. In this paper the applicability of ordinal assertions to phylogenetic inference is discussed and the following results are presented: The ordinal representation of a distance matrix is unique. This generalizes the well-known result that no two phylogenies share the same distance matrix [10, 20]. The ordinal representation of a distance matrix can be found in O(n 2 log 2 (n)) time. The algorithm presented improves upon an O(n 3 ) algorithm by Kannan and Warnow [13] that finds binary ordinal representations of distance matrices. Under certain conditions weighted ordinal representations can be found in polynomial d T (a; b) d T (c; d) if and only if M [a; b] M [c; d]:

Reference-contexts: This brings into question the appropriateness of the assumption of additivity. Recently alternative inference methods using ordinal assertions have been examined <ref> [15, 14, 13] </ref>. <p> As a by-product of the algorithm it is shown that ordinal representations are unique (section 3.5). Finally, in section 4 it is shown how weighted ordinal representations can be found under certain conditions. 2 Midpath Phylogenies: A Starting Point Midpath phylogenies were introduced in <ref> [14] </ref> as representations of evolutionary data. Here it is shown that an ordinal representation is a midpath phylogeny and, in fact, is an expansion of the minimal midpath phylogeny. Hence our understanding of ordinal representations begins with an articulation of these concepts. <p> T is a contraction of T 0 if T 0 is an expansion of T . T is a minimal midpath phylogeny of M if no contraction of T is a midpath phylogeny of M . Theorem 2 <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> This is also true when T R is a weighted ordinal representation of M . An optimal O (n 2 ) algorithm exists for finding the minimal midpath phylogeny of a distance matrix where n is the number of species <ref> [14] </ref>. In section 3 an algorithm is presented that expands the minimal midpath phylogeny T of a distance matrix M to an ordinal representation T R of M . In section 4 a method for expanding the minimal midpath phylogeny to a weighted ordinal representation is discussed. <p> Each of these operations can occur just once, hence, the complexity of maintaining D ON and D OF F is O (n 2 ). Step 1 of the algorithm requires O (n 2 ) as a minimal midpath phylogeny can be found in O (n 2 ) time <ref> [14] </ref>. The complexity of step 2 is a function of the complexity of determining Solution (v) for each vertex v of T . The while loop of step c iterates m v 1 times where m v denotes the number of v's children. <p> Often it is the topology of an evolutionary tree that is of primary interest and not the amount of evolution. The reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref> for more results on midpath phylogenies. This paper is an effort to better understand the relationship between a phylogeny T and the ordinal assertions supported by T . The understanding of this relationship is vital to the development of ordinal methods for phylogenetic inference.
