Abstract: This work is part of a joint project between IBM Almaden Research Center and the Ohio State University. The goal of the project is to facilitate the querying and browsing of multimedia databases over a wide spectrum of networks and media. In this paper, we focus on the related issues of data abstraction, navigation and presentation. We are proposing an integrated form of querying and hierarchical navigation that is similar to the methods used by data analysis systems to allow "drill down" operations on statistical data. We have applied our solution to hypertext style database publishing and developed a user customizable database visualization paradigm. The data visualization is interactive and enables users, even ones who have minimal familiarity with the database contents and schema, to easily pinpoint data in which they are interested. A pilot implementation for the project, using a web interface, is already operational. It provides access to tourist related data of the Greek National Tourist Organization, including on-line brochures, slides, video clips and other travel related information. In addition to this web interface, an interactive TV browsing interface is also under development.

Reference-contexts: Many Web sites, for example the well known Yahoo site, support only this type of loose integration. The area of On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP), which includes data analysis and decision support systems along with multidimensional databases, also deals with many of the problems we are addressing <ref> [GBLP95, CC94] </ref>. These systems group together subsets of the database and present aggregates and common features of the data items in each group. <p> For example, a user may want to navigate hotels based on how close they are to a specific city or based on their similarity 1 to another hotel. Most of the existing solutions deal only with a small (often less than twenty) and fixed number of hierarchies <ref> [CC94] </ref>. * The hierarchies built on top of the database need to be customizable. As a system is used, new hierarchies of interest may be discovered. <p> In developing an integrated query and navigation model, we have built upon techniques from declarative query languages (including visual query languages [Cru94, VAO93]) along with paradigms for navigating, summarizing and understanding data which are drawn largely from the arena of data analysis applications including multidimensional databases <ref> [CC94, GBLP95] </ref> and hypertext query interfaces [CT89]. Our approach permits both the use of conventional declarative queries and the use of navigational techniques, including drill down and roll up operators (explained below). <p> For a novice user, this might involve the initial specification of an imprecise, high level query and the incremental refinement of the query using summary and aggregate information provided about the requested data. This style of interaction has been called drilling down in the data analysis literature <ref> [CC94] </ref>. As a simple example, suppose the initial query is specified declaratively through a simple visual query language. 3 For our travel application, a user may begin by entering a query requesting inexpensive hotels in Greece. <p> In addition to this drill down style of navigation, a user may relax an over-specified query or incrementally change the requirements of a query. This mode of operation is similar to the roll up operators described in the data analysis literature <ref> [CC94] </ref>. In our example, after determining that the hotels in Rhodes are not of interest, the user may backup in the navigation to a higher level of abstraction either in the same hierarchy used to drill down or in another hierarchy. <p> This functionality is especially important for enabling navigation over heterogeneous data sets which may require arbitrary computations to integrate. * Hierarchies are extensible and are not limited to a fixed set as used in hypertext systems or to a fixed number as advocated for multidimensional analysis <ref> [CC94] </ref>. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the data and to the diverse requirements of users, it must be possible to add new hierarchies of data domains. * The user will have a predefined set of hierarchies available for navigating through the data.

Reference-contexts: A price of $50 per night may (in Greece) be considered on the borderline between inexpensive and moderate and should therefore be classified as both. 4 We are using the QBIC system to provide data retrieval operators that are based on image content including color composition and shape <ref> [LBN + 94] </ref>. 4 * Hierarchies may be computed or stored. Many hierarchies can be expressed as some computation over the base data. Specifically, for each level of an abstraction, the grouping (s) into which a data item maps can be calculated via some computed relation or function. <p> The Shark server offers appropriate quality of service guarantees for real time video display and also doubles as a generic high performance BLOB (Binary Large Object) server. The image files stored in the Shark server may be processed using operators provided by QBIC <ref> [LBN + 94] </ref>. These operators can be used to extract image features and query images by content, for example by shape, color and texture. Hierarchies, user-defined functions, and metadata may be characterized by a complicated structure and behavior.
