Abstract: The theory of [RS2] is applied to yield compactly supported tight affine frames (wavelets) in L 2 (IR d ) from box splines. The wavelets obtained are smooth piecewise- polynomials on a simple mesh; furthermore, they exhibit a wealth of symmetries, and have a relatively small support. The number of "mother wavelets", however, increases with the increase of the required smoothness.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known (cf. <ref> [BHR] </ref>) that the box spline satisfies the following properties: (a) It is a piecewise-polynomial of local degree 2 (m 1 + m 2 1), on the four-direction mesh (that is obtained by adding the diagonals to each square of integer vertices). 3 (b) It is globally C 2 with := minf2m

Reference-contexts: The only construction of compactly supported four-directional spline frames that we are aware of, appears in <ref> [CJS] </ref>. There, the same dilation matrix s is employed, and a compactly supported spline wavelet that is orthogonal to the box spline space while lying in the next dilation level is identified. <p> This wavelet is then complemented by one of its translates, and the affine system is then generated by these two mother wavelets, and is proved, by an involved argument, to be a frame. The resulted frame is not tight, and no estimates for the frame bounds are given in <ref> [CJS] </ref>. In fact, the problem of finding a dual frame is not addressed in [CJS], and it is likely that a dual frame of compact support does not exist.

To fill in an entire dyadic level using integer shifts of our elements, we need the three elements of support area of 7 each, and 6 elements of half-size support, with total area of supports 42. Finally, the <ref> [CJS] </ref> construction provides here two smooth symmetric spline wavelets each supported in a domain of area 28. However, as mentioned before, this frame is not tight, and no simple recipe for a dual frame is known. 1:0 is obtained by rotation. Example.

Reference-contexts: In order for T fl to exhibit good space-frequency localization, the functions should be local in the space domain (ideally compactly supported), should be smooth (which leads to good decay in the frequency domain), and should provide positive approximation order.

Reference-contexts: The theory established in <ref> [RS2] </ref>, however, makes the construction of useful simple nonseparable compactly supported tight frames with high smoothness and a variety of symmetries an easy task. <p> In fact, one can essentially construct tight frames with the aid of the shifts of any refinable function, and therefore it is possible to impose a simple structure on the wavelets by selecting a refinable function with such desired structure. Indeed, we constructed in <ref> [RS2] </ref>, for every positive integer m, a tight frame for L 2 (IR) that is generated by m wavelets, each of which is a spline of degree m 1, support [0; m], and smoothness C m2 . <p> Further, all knots of the spline-wavelets are half-integers, and each spline is either symmetric or anti-symmetric. (The case m = 4 of this construction is discussed in x4). 2 Since the variety of possible constructions of multivariate (and univariate) tight frames based on the <ref> [RS2] </ref> theory is unlimited, we carefully selected for the present article those constructions which, in our opinion, may be used in practical applications. <p> In fact, the problem of finding a dual frame is not addressed in [CJS], and it is likely that a dual frame of compact support does not exist. In contrast, our constructions of tight frames are obtained with relative ease. The main reason for that is that the <ref> [RS2] </ref> theory provides us with a simple criterion for tight frames, that does not impose any a priori assumption on the refinable function . <p> Our construction invokes the following theorem, which is a special case of Corollary 6.7 of <ref> [RS2] </ref>. Theorem 2.3. Let be any box spline that is refinable with respect to the dilation matrix s of (2.2), and has a (2-periodic) refinement mask t 0 . Let n be a positive integer, and let (t j ) n j=1 be n 2-periodic essentially bounded measurable functions. <p> The theory of <ref> [RS2] </ref> allows us to pay less attention to the properties of the scaling function: "bad" properties of the latter may not at all be inherited by the wavelets! Specifically, the smoothness of the wavelets and the tightness of the frame they generate do not compete any more. <p> On the other hand, 1 , in all examples we carry in mind, is a function. In fact, if 1 is a function, Corollary 6.7 of <ref> [RS2] </ref> "almost" implies that, under the condition (b) of the conditions (4.1), the system generated by the wavelets that are defined via their Fourier transforms by 13 is a tight frame for L 2 (IR d ). <p> The only missing condition is a very mild smoothness re-quirement of 1 , that all box splines, for example, satisfy (cf. (4.6) of <ref> [RS2] </ref>). Note that significantly weaker conditions are assumed on T 2 . <p> Rather than quoting the complicated condition (4.6) of <ref> [RS2] </ref>, we assume in the following corollary smoothness conditions that are slightly stronger but more transparent. Corollary 4.3. <p> The function 2 is refinable with respect to the dilation matrix s employed in x3, and with mask (up to an exponential factor) cos m 1 (! 1 =2). Since this mask is univariate, one can use our univariate construction from <ref> [RS2] </ref> to obtain the T 2 masks T 2 := fy j (! 1 ) : j = 1; : : : ; m 1 g: As to 1 , the box spline 1 is refinable with mask (up to an exponential factor) cos m 2 (! 2 =2), and hence <p> In the final example of this section, we employ the gen-eral algorithm of this section in the construction of a univariate compactly supported tight frame generated by C 2 cubic splines. Prior to doing that, we recall that <ref> [RS2] </ref> already provides such a construction. Its construction yields four generators ( j ) 4 j=1 , each supported in the interval [2; 2] whose Fourier transforms satisfy b j (2!) = 4 (!=2) 4 : The graphs of these four functions are given in Figure 4.1. [2; 2].
