Abstract: Inf-sup conditions are proven for three finite difference approximations of the Stokes equations by using the average values over certain oblique lines. This approximation technique preserves the divergence-free property which is important to the study of the Stokes equations. Moreover the approximation gives bounds on the norms of the divided differences of functions in the approximated space by the norms of the derivatives of functions in the continuous space. In a subsequent work we use the inf-sup conditions to prove estimates on the order of accuracy of the finite difference schemes.

Reference-contexts: Hence (4.2), (4.5) and (4.6) may hold when p e is a piecewise constant function and ~u e is a piecewise linear constant function. The inf-sup conditions of this case for both the conforming and non-conforming finite element spaces for Stokes equations are discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. Consider the case when one uses the triangles generated by dividing S l;m into two equal triangles as we show in Figure 8.

Using the average values over horizontal and vertical line segments, Temam [14] mentions that the divergence-free property is kept in the resulting finite difference space. The divergence-free property holds in almost all applications. Hence it is important to study this finite difference space.
