Abstract: Many artificial intelligence tasks (e.g., planning, situation assessment, scheduling) require reasoning about events in time. Temporal constraint networks offer an elegant and often computationally efficient framework for formulation and solution of such temporal reasoning tasks. Temporal data and knowledge available in some domains is necessarily imprecise - e.g., as a result of measurement errors associated with sensors. This paper introduces stochastic temporal constraint networks thereby extending constraint-based approaches to temporal reasoning with precise temporal knowledge to handle stochastic imprecision. The paper proposes an algorithm for inference of implicit stochastic temporal constraints from a given set of explicit constraints. It also introduces a stochastic version of the temporal constraint network consistency verification problem and describes techniques for solving it under certain simplifying assumptions.

Reference-contexts: Further, to simplify analysis using standard techniques of probability theory <ref> (e.g. Von Mises, 1964) </ref>, we also assume that the probability density functions satisfy the assumptions under which the maximum likelihood approach can be used. <p> A simple rule of thumb suggests the selection of the derived implicit constraint that has the smallest variance and ignore the rest. A potentially better alternative is suggested by the maximum likelihood approach in statistics <ref> (Von Mises, 1964) </ref>. Within a maximum likelihood framework, it is natural to treat possible mismatches between different estimates of a derived constraint obtained from using different paths in the constraint graph as a result of stochastic imprecision associated with the explicit constraints. <p> Stochastic hypotheses testing problem have been treated in detail in the probability theory literature <ref> (Von Mises, 1964) </ref>.Therefore, we limit our discussion below to an outline of the key results. The interested reader is referred to Von Mises (1964) or other advanced texts on probability theory for details.
