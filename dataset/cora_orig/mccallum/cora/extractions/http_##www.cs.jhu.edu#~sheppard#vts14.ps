Abstract: Using nearest neighbor classification with fault dictionaries to resolve inexact signature matches in digital circuit diagnosis is inadequate. Nearest neighbor focuses on the possible diagnoses rather than on the tests. Our alternativethe information flow modelfocuses on test information in the fault dictionary to provide more accurate diagnostics.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, with a proper model, high confidence tests, and a reasonable fault universe, many faults will be identified in this manner. For illustration purposes, we use a simple digital circuit <ref> (Abramovici, Breuer, and Friedman, 1990) </ref>. This circuit is given in Figure 1. From this figure, and assuming a single stuck-at fault model, we can identify 26 possible stuck-at faults.

Reference-contexts: only the sample circuit and used both Hamming distance ( d ( , ) | |s s s s i j i j b = - ) and the overlap metric ( d ( , ) | | | |s s s s s s = ) as distance measures <ref> (Debaney and Unkle, 1995) </ref>. The matching procedure was limited to 1-NN; we would expect worse results for k-NN with k &gt; 1 because faults are only represented by a small number (e.g., one) of signatures.

Reference-contexts: Dempster-Shafer theory then combines information from multiple tests using Dempsters rule of combinations <ref> (Dempster, 1968) </ref>. As tests are performed, Dempsters rule is applied iteratively to allow test information to be accumulated and the diagnostic process to be optimized. 4 Converting the Fault Dictionary The information flow model specifies the inferences that can be drawn given each test outcome.

Reference-contexts: Additional research in using fault dictionaries for diagnosis has attempted to improve the performance of the matching algorithms. This research focuses on issues such as fault dictionary compression (Ryan, 1994), probabilistic matching <ref> (Denux, 1995) </ref>, and error bounding (Kliger et al., 1995). Unfortunately, none of these approaches satisfy the requirements of Cover and Hart (1967).

Reference-contexts: Further, faults within the system affect more than one test indicating some form of dependence among the test outcomes.

Reference-contexts: Because of the inherent difficulties in processing erroneous test data in fault dictionaries, we present an alternative approachthe information flow modelfor processing these data <ref> (Sheppard and Simpson, 1991) </ref>. This alternative considers test results as evidence for or against the presence of a fault in the system. Test results are processed sequentially, and the evidence supporting or denying the presence of a failure mode is attributed to the set of failure modes in the system.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in addition to the inference process described above (i.e., the set partitioning process), we use a modification of Dempster-Shafer statistical inference which has its root in Bayesian inference <ref> (Simpson and Sheppard, 1994) </ref>. Shafer (1976) added the concept of uncertainty to the Bayesian approach (of applying Bayes rule) which resulted in two measures being applied to a conclusion. Using this approach, we compute values for two extremes of a credibility interval for every conclusion in the model. <p> Conversely, if any of those tests pass, then the failure mode must not be present. Converting fault dictionaries to information flow models is easily achieved by interpreting these representations as attribute maps which have been discussed at length <ref> (Simpson and Sheppard, 1994) </ref>. As with the fault dictionary, the information flow model closes the fault universe by defining the special conclusion no fault. The no fault conclusion has no specified inference relationships with any tests because a failed no fault cannot imply the failure of any test.
