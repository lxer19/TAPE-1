Abstract: The development of two tools to study the performance of automated highways is presented. The first is a spacing tool that produces the minimum spacing necessary for two vehicles not to collide, as a function of their initial velocities and their deceleration capabilities. The second tool investigates the multiple collisions that may occur in a string of vehicles if the requirements made by the first tool are violated. We show how the tools can be used to obtain estimates of the safety and throughput that can be expected if various automated highway concepts are implemented.

Reference-contexts: Assume that vehicle B is leading while vehicle C comes last, i.e. x B &gt; x A &gt; x C &gt; 0. Following <ref> [1] </ref>, assume that the longitudinal dynamics of vehicle A can be modeled by a third order system and that the acceleration of vehicle B can not be measured by vehicle A. <p> The candidate saddle solution simply dictates that both vehicles decelerate as hard as possible and both collisions take place at time t = 0 with the maximum allowable change in velocity. In <ref> [1] </ref> it was shown that: Lemma 1 (u fl ; d fl ) is globally a saddle solution for cost J (x 0 ; u; d). Using the saddle solution, we calculate optimal cost J fl (x 0 ) for a given initial condition x 0 .

Reference-contexts: that the acceleration of A and B follow the trajectories of Figure 2 until the vehicles stop or collide 2 . 1 This may be the case in a platoon of vehicles undergoing emer gency deceleration due to a fault for example. 2 For more elaborate deceleration profiles refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. As _x B 0 and we are interested in investigating the cases where the vehicles collide, we restrict our attention to the interval of time when _x A &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: As _x B 0 and we are interested in investigating the cases where the vehicles collide, we restrict our attention to the interval of time when _x A &gt; 0. It is easy to show <ref> [3] </ref> that under these conditions the spacing and relative velocity between vehicles A and B is given by: x 3 (t) = 2 3 (6) The values of a; b, and c depend on the parameters of the problem (a ij and d i ). <p> Figures 4, 5 represent results for informa tion structures 2 and 3. From the figures it seems that if available, platoon size N available, platoon size N partial information is available much higher throughputs are possible using large platoons. Results for information structure 1 are similar (refer to <ref> [3] </ref>). It should be noted that this pipeline calculation will produce the maximum throughput that can be obtained under the assumed conditions. <p> Figure 6 shows collision statistics collected using the collision tool. The results indicate that even though most of the collisions occur at small relative velocities, there is a significant probability of high relative velocity collisions. This probability increases with the size of the platoon. Other statistics <ref> [3] </ref> reveal that the average number of collisions per vehicle due to hard braking by the platoon leader increases roughly linearly with the platoon size. The collision calculation imposes a restriction on the throughput that can be achieved safely.

Reference-contexts: In addition the class of trajectories characterized in this way can be shown to contain trajectories which are in some sense optimal (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Based on these calculations a computational collision tool was developed.

Reference-contexts: The iteration terminates when no more collisions are possible. 3. Throughput/Safety Tradeoff Analysis We use a probability distribution on the minimum acceleration of vehicles, constructed in <ref> [5] </ref> by averaging over manufacturers specifications for a number of current pro duction models (Figure 3). The values of throughput and passenger vehicles safety obtained here are essentially the expected values over this probability distribution. 3.1. Normal Operation The throughput estimates we produce here are the so called "pipeline" estimates.

Reference-contexts: For platoons of length N &gt; 1 the deceleration exerted by the leader should be limited by the deceleration capabilities of the followers, to guarantee the string stability of the platoon. Motivated by the work of <ref> [6] </ref> we use the following formula to calculate the minimum allowable deceleration, a allow , for a leader: a allow = max min ; min ; min ; min ; min for i 4 (11) where a i min is the deceleration capability of the i th fol lower.
