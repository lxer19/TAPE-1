Abstract: These wavelength cross-connect switches have the property that they may configure themselves into unspecified states. Each input port of a switch is always connected to some output port of the switch whether or not such a connection is required for the purpose of information transfer. Due to the presence of these unspecified states, there exists the possibility of setting up unintended all-optical cycles in the network (viz. a loop with no terminating electronics in it). If such a cycle contains amplifiers (e.g., Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs)), there exists the possibility that the net loop gain is greater than the net loop loss. The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from amplifiers can build up in such a feedback loop to saturate the amplifiers and result in oscillations of the ASE noise in the loop. Such all-optical cycles as defined above (and hereafter referred to as "white" cycles) must be eliminated from an optical network in order for the network to perform any useful operation. Furthermore, for the realistic case in which the wavelength cross-connects result in signal crosstalk, there is a possibility of having closed cycles with oscillating crosstalk signals. We examine algorithms that set up new transparent optical connections upon request while avoiding the creation of such cycles in the network. These algorithms attempt to find a route for a connection and then (in a post-processing fashion) configure switches such that white cycles that might get created would automatically get eliminated. In addition, our call-set-up algorithms can avoid the possibility of crosstalk cycles.

Reference-contexts: The ASE from the EDFAs passes through the AOTFs in the BAR state and forms closed feedback loops. Hence, such cycles must be eliminated as a first principle. This paper builds up on previous work <ref> [2] </ref>, and proposes network-layer solutions to this problem. Furthermore, the presence of crosstalk in the cross-connects can exacerbate the problem. Our algorithms can eliminate crosstalk as well. <p> Crosstalk problems are addressed by our algorithms, but we have not addressed the problems created by switching multiple wavelengths on a fiber. 7. We may design the network's physical connections such that "fl 0 cycles" are eliminated when switches are in default (BAR) state <ref> [2] </ref>. Alternatively, the network must have been previously designed this way. 3 Overview of Solution/Algorithms In this section, we provide an outline of our network-layer solution approach to eliminate all-optical cycles in a wavelength-routed optical network (see Fig. 4). The solution approach consists of six modules.
