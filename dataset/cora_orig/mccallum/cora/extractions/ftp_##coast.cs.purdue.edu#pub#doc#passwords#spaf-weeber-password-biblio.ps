Abstract: 195] Raymond M. Wong, Thomas A. Berson, and Richard J. Feiertag. Polonius: An identity authentication system. In IEEE 1985 Symposium on Security and Privacy, pages 101-107, Silver Spring, MD, April 1985. IEEE Computer Society Press. This paper describes an authentication method making use of personal authentication devices known as PassPorts. The devices implement a form on one-time pad encryption. When a user attempts to logon to a host, the host transmits a seven digit challenge. The user keys the challenge along with a PIN into the PassPort and receives a seven digit response. The response is keyed into the terminal, and if it matches what the host expected, the user is authenticated.

A quantitative measure of password strength and `lasting' power is developed. Five password encryption techniques are discussed and compared using several criteria. Finally, ten authentication guidelines are presented. </title>

A list of recommended techniques for password selection is provided. Passwords and methods crackers have used to break into systems as well as security guidelines for system managers are also discussed. 1 User Authentication and Related Topics: An Annotated Bibliography Eugene H.
