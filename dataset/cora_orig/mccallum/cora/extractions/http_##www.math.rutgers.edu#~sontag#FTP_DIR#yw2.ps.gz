Abstract: This paper studies fundamental analytic properties of generating series for nonlinear control systems, and of the operators they define. It then applies the results obtained to the extension of facts, which relate realizability and algebraic input/output equations, to local realizability and analytic equations.

Reference-contexts: the series 1 X M l converges uniformly for jz t 0 j N M t 0 (m + 1) 7 Now let 1 Then the series of complex functions X defines an analytic function in B ~ ffi (t 0 ) since it converges uniformly, (cf: Theorem 5.1 in <ref> [1] </ref>). For t real, F d [v](t t 0 ) = hd; iV [v](t t 0 ) = hd; iV [~v](t t 0 ): Thus, F d [v](t t 0 ), i.e. F c [u](t), is analytic for jt t 0 j &lt; ~ ffi. <p> holds for all C k i/o pairs of F c if and only if it holds at any point at which u (t) is C k , for every u 2 V T . 2 To prove Lemma 4.1, we need the following Lemma: Lemma 4.3 Assume f 2 C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and f (0) = 0. Then for each given integer n 0, there exists a sequence of polynomial functions ff k g such that f k ! f; as k ! 1 uniformly and f (i) 14 Proof.

Reference-contexts: In particular, generating series have been a popular choice for representing input/output operators, starting with the work of Fliess in the late 1970s (see for instance the references <ref> [2] </ref>, [4]). This paper has two main goals. First, we study a number of properties of generating series and the operators they define.

Reference-contexts: Notice that, for every multiindex , V [u](t) is absolutely continuous as a function of t. It follows immediately from the fact that F c [u] defined by (4) converges uniformly that F c [u](t) is continuous on [0; T ]. If fact, it was shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that for any u 2 V T , F c [u]() is absolutely continuous. <p> However, in contrast to its algebraic analogue, the converse of Theorem 3 does not hold in the analytic case. By a small modification of a construction due to Respondek, it is shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that the following system defines an i/o operator F so that F [u] is defined for 0 t 1 and all u for which ku 2 k 1 1, but F does not satisfy any analytic i/o equation.

Note that Q 1 (c) is always defined since A 1 (c) is an integral domain (cf [15]). <p> (c) is the IR-algebra generated by the elements of F 1 (c), under the shu*e product (see <ref> [15] </ref>), and the observation field Q 1 (c) is the quotient field of A 1 (c). Note that Q 1 (c) is always defined since A 1 (c) is an integral domain (cf [15]). <p> Since ju# t ! (s)j &lt; 1 for s 2 [0; t + ffi] for some small ffi, it follows that jv j (s)j &lt; 1 for s 2 [0; t + ffi] if j is large enough. Similar to the algebraic case discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>, we have the following result: 16 Lemma 4.4 If F c satisfies an analytic i/o equation, then it satisfies a meromorphic i/o equa- tion. Proof. <p> Again, Q 2 (c) is always well defined since A 2 (c) is an integral domain (cf <ref> [15] </ref>). The following Theorem relates the existence of analytic i/o equations to analytic finiteness properties of the observation algebra and field. An analogous result holds in the algebraic case (see [15]). Theorem 2 Assume c is a convergent power series. <p> Again, Q 2 (c) is always well defined since A 2 (c) is an integral domain (cf <ref> [15] </ref>). The following Theorem relates the existence of analytic i/o equations to analytic finiteness properties of the observation algebra and field. An analogous result holds in the algebraic case (see [15]). Theorem 2 Assume c is a convergent power series. Then (a) Q 2 (c) is meromorphically finitely generated if F c satisfies an analytic i/o equation; 18 (b) A 2 (c) is analytically finitely generated if F c satisfies an analytically recursive i/o equation. Proof. <p> Then (a) F c is realizable by an analytic system if F c satisfies an analytically recursive i/o equation. (b) F c is locally realizable by an analytic system if F c satisfies an analytic i/o equation. 6 Remarks We have shown in <ref> [15] </ref> that the existence of an algebraic i/o equation is equivalent to realizability by a singular polynomial system. However, in contrast to its algebraic analogue, the converse of Theorem 3 does not hold in the analytic case. <p> Details will be given in a future paper. An alternative, but closely related, idea is being developed by W. Respondek (personal communication). 7 Comparison With Algebraic Results Throughout the paper we have mentioned analogies with the algebraic case considered in <ref> [15] </ref>. In this section, we summarize these analogies and we point out the major differences with the analytic case. 21 The definition of input/output operator is the same in both papers, but while here we deal with analytic systems (17), in [15] the interest is in systems defined by rational equations. <p> have mentioned analogies with the algebraic case considered in <ref> [15] </ref>. In this section, we summarize these analogies and we point out the major differences with the analytic case. 21 The definition of input/output operator is the same in both papers, but while here we deal with analytic systems (17), in [15] the interest is in systems defined by rational equations. <p> Note that neither result contains the other, as global realization by rational systems does not imply local analytic realizability, due to the possibility of poles. Analytic i/o equations (30) are replaced in <ref> [15] </ref> by polynomial equations, meromorphic equations are replaced by "rational equations" in which the highest derivative of the output is expressible as a rational function of lower order derivatives, and analytically recursive equations are replaced by "recursive" equations in which the latter expression contains no derivatives of outputs in the denominator. <p> Finally, the form of the main Theorem 3 is similar to that in <ref> [15] </ref>, except that the converse of part (b) holds for algebraic equations and rational systems. This was discussed in the previous section, and is due to the lack of a strong property of elimination in the analytic case.
