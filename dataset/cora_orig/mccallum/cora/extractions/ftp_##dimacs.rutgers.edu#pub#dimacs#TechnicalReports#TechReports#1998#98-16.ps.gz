Reference-contexts: Connection request sequences are then randomly generated between pairs of nodes in different lower-level domains. 3.2 Performance of Link Cost Function Theoretical results <ref> [AAP93] </ref> suggest that an optimal competitive on-line routing algorithm can be obtained by using an exponential link cost function.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, the problem of quantifying the tradeoffs in topology aggregation and determining its effects on network performance has received little attention to date. While there is a large body of theoretical research addressing the problem of compact graph representations <ref> [Bar96, PU88, PS89, ADD + 93] </ref>, the emphasis of these efforts has been on minimizing the worst-pair distortion of costs 1 . <p> In this paper, we simulate several aggregation schemes and compare them. Aggregation strategies based on star graphs, spanning trees, and spanners <ref> [PU88, PS89, ADD + 93] </ref> are compared to the case of perfect aggregation (i.e., a lossless scheme that uses the complete graph). Performance is measured in two ways: network throughput and network control load. <p> It would be interesting to investigate the performance of t-spanner aggregation when permitted stretch factor t is increased. This would also be important since the best bound <ref> [ADD + 93] </ref> on the size of a 2-spanner is O (n p n), where n is the number of border nodes. This is too costly to be scalable, but perhaps larger values of t would result in smaller representations without an unacceptable loss in performance.

Reference-contexts: Aggregation using the minimum spanning tree (MST) is seen to yield very good overall network performance. This fact, together with the simplicity of calculating spanning trees makes them an attractive candidate for use in practice, e.g., Awerbuch and Shavitt <ref> [AS98] </ref> suggest a profitable enhancement to the current PNNI standard based on random trees. In addition, we also investigate the impact of link cost functions, and re-aggregation policy. A link cost function is a mapping from the resources available on the link (e.g. bandwidth) to a real number. <p> MST can already be partially implemented by using the exception (border-to-border) link mechanism in the complex node representation of PNNI [PNN96, section 3.3.8]. An algorithm for another tree-based construction within the guidelines of the PNNI aggregation specification is described and analyzed in <ref> [AS98] </ref>. We intend to simulate the performance of this construction as part of our future work. We demonstrate that using our proposed logarithmic update policy reduces the number of re-aggregation computations drastically, while not compromising network performance in any significant way.

Reference-contexts: Reasons of both scalability and security will mandate that domains not reveal the details of their internal structure to outside nodes <ref> [PNN96, CCS96] </ref>. Instead, domains will disclose only a summary, or aggregated view, of the costs and availabilities associated with traversing them.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon of bottleneck behavior was also observed by Cidon et al. <ref> [CRS96] </ref> for one-way reservation schemes. Randomly generated topologies Randomized I. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the simulation results for the network depicted in figure 3. The throughput observed for the different aggregation schemes generally varied by less than 1.5%.

Reference-contexts: Reasons of both scalability and security will mandate that domains not reveal the details of their internal structure to outside nodes <ref> [PNN96, CCS96] </ref>. Instead, domains will disclose only a summary, or aggregated view, of the costs and availabilities associated with traversing them. <p> The benefit of larger, more accurate representations is principally better route selection. In PNNI <ref> [PNN96] </ref>, for example, a connection setup slated to travel through some domain (based on a source route calculation using advertised information) might discover upon arriving in the domain that the intended transit is actually not feasible. <p> There are many possible, yet untested, aggregation schemes. One possible choice has been recently adopted by the Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) group of the ATM Forum. To circumvent the unscalable nature of the complete graph aggregation mentioned above, the PNNI <ref> [PNN96] </ref> standard specifies that the internal structure of each ATM domain (peer group) be represented as a "star" graph that has one virtual center node (nucleus) and weighted spokes between this nucleus and each of the domain's border nodes. <p> The impressive overall performance of the MST aggregation scheme presents a strong case for proposing an extension to the PNNI standard. MST can already be partially implemented by using the exception (border-to-border) link mechanism in the complex node representation of PNNI <ref> [PNN96, section 3.3.8] </ref>. An algorithm for another tree-based construction within the guidelines of the PNNI aggregation specification is described and analyzed in [AS98]. We intend to simulate the performance of this construction as part of our future work.

Reference-contexts: To determine how each of these parameters affects network performance, we have sought to simulate topologies that best illustrate the tradeoffs in the possible values of the parameters. We also report our experimental results for simulations of randomly generated network topologies, using the standard random graph generation techniques <ref> [Wax88] </ref>. 2.2 Aggregation schemes The following aggregation schemes were simulated: Complete No aggregation is done. The full cost matrix between the border nodes is advertised. DIA A star with radius equal to half the cost of the network diameter. <p> Links are added via a random process that repeatedly generates a random node-pair within each domain, and adds a link between them with probability that decays exponentially with the Euclidean distance between the two nodes <ref> [Wax88] </ref>. Links that would cause the degree - 6 - as indicated by the ring on the right. The number at the end of an edges on the right graph indicates the node number to which this edge is connected in the higher layer.
