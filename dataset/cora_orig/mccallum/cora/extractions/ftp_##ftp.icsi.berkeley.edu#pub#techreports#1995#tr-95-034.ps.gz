Abstract: Current solutions to providing statistical performance guarantees to bursty traffic such as compressed video encounter several problems: 1) source traffic descriptors are often too simple to capture the burstiness and important time-correlations of VBR sources or too complex to be used for admission control algorithms; 2) stochastic descriptions of a source are inherently difficult for the network to enforce or police; 3) multiplexing inside the network's queues may change the stochastic properties of the source in an intractable way, precluding the provision of end-to-end QoS guarantees to heterogeneous sources with different performance requirements. In this paper, we present a new approach to providing end-to-end statistical performance guarantees that overcomes these limitations. We term the approach Hybrid Bounding Interval Dependent (H-BIND) because it uses the Deterministic-BIND traffic model to capture the correlation structure and burstiness properties of a stream; but unlike a deterministic performance guarantee, it achieves a Statistical Multiplexing Gain (SMG)

Reference-contexts: A further benefit of using only deterministic traffic specifications is that such constraints can be enforced by the network, unlike traditional stochastic traffic descriptors. 11 3.4.2 End-to-End Guarantees The above single hop delay-violation probability can be extended to an end-to-end probability using the delay-jitter control techniques of <ref> [7, 24] </ref>. Delay-jitter control decouples the network nodes by reconstructing the sources' original traffic pattern at each hop, effectively absorbing the delay-jitter introduced by the previous hop.

Reference-contexts: Of the many traffic classes in integrated services networks, delay-and loss-sensitive Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic poses a unique challenge, since providing good Quality of Service (QoS) to such bursty traffic sources is at odds with achieving high network utilization. In the scheme of <ref> [8] </ref>, two types of guarantees are proposed to support VBR traffic: deterministic guarantees, in which loss, delay and throughput are guaranteed even in the worst case, and statistical guarantees, in which the network provides probabilistic guarantees on loss and delay. <p> and in [15], it was demonstrated that the achievable utilization in a deterministic setting is largely determined by the choice of the deterministic traffic model. 2.1 D-BIND Model As shown in [15], previous deterministic traffic models such as the (; ) model [2] and the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model <ref> [8] </ref> cannot capture the property that sources exhibit burstiness over a wide variety of interval lengths. The D-BIND traffic model was introduced to address this issue. <p> This allows us to analyze each scheduler using the same traffic characterization. Thus, if a delay bound d h is provided at hop h with violation probability h , then the end-to-end delay-bound-violation probability is P robfD e2e &gt; P Q h (see also <ref> [8] </ref>). Additionally, for H-BIND statistical guarantees and D-BIND deterministic guarantees, the simpler rate-jitter control mechanisms for D-BIND (e.g., [15, 21]) may be sufficient in practice.

Reference-contexts: The compression algorithm is constant-quality MPEG 1 compression performed in software (see <ref> [10] </ref> for further details of MPEG 1). Plotting the bounding rate vs. interval length, the figure shows that the model captures the source's burstiness over multiple interval lengths. For example, for small interval lengths, R k approaches the source's peak rate, R 1 = 5.87 Mbps.

Specifically, using traces of MPEG compressed video, <ref> [15] </ref> showed that using the Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent (D-BIND) traffic model, utilizations on the order of 15% to 30% are achievable for queueing delay bounds in the range of 30 msec. <p> To achieve higher utilization, statistical multiplexing must be used. In this paper, we propose a new approach to providing statistical performance guarantees that overcomes 1 many of the limitations of previous approaches. As in <ref> [15] </ref>, the approach uses the D-BIND traffic model to characterize a stream's burstiness properties and temporal correlation structure. However, unlike a deterministic approach, we do not consider the aggregate process as a worst case aggregation of individual sources. <p> The goal is to provide a statistical service with many of the advantages of the deterministic approach in <ref> [15] </ref>, without most of the disadvantages of the statistical approaches in [9].

The D-BIND traffic model was introduced to address this issue. <p> The key components of the D-BIND model are that it is bounding, required to provide deterministic QoS guarantees, and interval-dependent, needed to capture important burstiness properties of sources. This more accurate traffic characterization then allows for a higher network utilization for a given delay bound (see <ref> [15] </ref>). Each deterministic traffic model uses parameters to define a traffic constraint function b (t), which constrains or bounds the source over every interval of length t. <p> As well, the techniques presented here could be applied to other deterministic traffic models such as the multi-level leaky bucket, which is a special case of D-BIND <ref> [15] </ref>. By utilizing the CLT, statistical independence of streams' phases is exploited to achieve a statistical multiplexing gain. Further, computationally expensive matrix calculations or convolutions are avoided. <p> Additionally, for H-BIND statistical guarantees and D-BIND deterministic guarantees, the simpler rate-jitter control mechanisms for D-BIND (e.g., <ref> [15, 21] </ref>) may be sufficient in practice. That is, a D-BIND rate-jitter-controller at each hop will ensure that each stream conforms to its original D-BIND characterization at each hop along the connection's path. <p> We used the D-BIND deterministic traffic model to capture a stream's correlation structure and burstiness properties over multiple interval lengths. However, unlike a deterministic performance guarantee as in <ref> [15] </ref>, the H-BIND approach exploits statistical properties of deterministically constrained sources. In this way, our approach is able to achieve considerable multiplexing gains while avoiding many of the disadvantages of traditional approaches to providing statistical performance guarantees.

In Section 2, we review the D-BIND model and its application to providing deterministic performance guarantees in an integrated services environment.

Reference-contexts: We show that utilizations of up to 86% are achievable in a realistic scenario, and that the admission control test, while slightly conservative, closely approximates the performance observed in trace-driven simulations. A related problem was studied in <ref> [3, 4, 12, 20] </ref> via analysis of the nD/D/1 queue, considering periodic sources with uniformly distributed independent phases. <p> Using various techniques, queue length distributions were derived for the case of sources with identical periods in [3, 4, 12] and bounds for the queue length distribution for the case of heterogeneous periods in <ref> [20] </ref>. The nD/D/1 queue is unlike the current approach in that, rather than assuming sources are deterministic, we are using deterministic bounds on sources as provided by the D-BIND model. Moreover, in our analysis, the sources are more general than the periodic model of the nD/D/1 queue.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, in our analysis, the sources are more general than the periodic model of the nD/D/1 queue. Finally, in this work we consider QoS bounds for priority service disciplines such as RCSP <ref> [21] </ref> rather than for FCFS. Such a service discipline is important to providing integrated services to heterogeneous sources. The recent works of [5, 19] also consider stochastic bounds for deterministically constrained sources. <p> With this bound on aggregate arrivals, admission control conditions for deterministic delay and throughput bounds may be derived. Below, we demonstrate how heterogeneous, deterministic, QoS guarantees can be provided to heterogeneous sources by using the Rate-Controlled Static Priority (RCSP) Service Discipline <ref> [21] </ref>. The scheduler is based on a number of prioritized FCFS queues, where queue p has an associated delay bound d p . A 4 number of heterogeneous connections can be multiplexed at a given priority level p. The maximum number of schedulable connections is determined by the following theorem. <p> Finally, in Section 3.4, we utilize the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to provide a more practical admission control condition. 3.1 Bounding Delay in a Static Priority Scheduler A static priority scheduler as in <ref> [21] </ref> consists of a number of prioritized FIFO queues. Each connection is assigned a priority p at connection setup time. The assigned priority level is based on the connection's requested QoS, including whether it has requested deterministic or statistical service, and on the requested delay bound. <p> Additionally, for H-BIND statistical guarantees and D-BIND deterministic guarantees, the simpler rate-jitter control mechanisms for D-BIND (e.g., <ref> [15, 21] </ref>) may be sufficient in practice. That is, a D-BIND rate-jitter-controller at each hop will ensure that each stream conforms to its original D-BIND characterization at each hop along the connection's path.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we present the analytical foundations of the H-BIND approach, and in Section 4, we evaluate the approach using a 28 minute trace of MPEG compressed video. 2 A Deterministic Approach A deterministic service provides the best QoS with its no-drop, no-delay-bound-violation guarantee. In <ref> [1, 2, 17, 22] </ref>, it was shown that peak-rate-allocation is not required to provide deterministic guarantees to VBR traffic, and in [15], it was demonstrated that the achievable utilization in a deterministic setting is largely determined by the choice of the deterministic traffic model. 2.1 D-BIND Model As shown in [15],

Reference-contexts: In the first part of the experiment, we parameterize the traces using eight D-BIND rate-interval pairs. For a "live" sequence, where the trace is not available in advance, <ref> [23] </ref> presents an on-line algorithm for obtaining (and adapting) the rate-interval pairs. These rate-interval pairs are then used in the admission control condition of Equation (12) to calculate the maximum number of admissible connections for a given delay bound and delay-violation probability.

Reference-contexts: A statistical guarantee utilizes statistical multiplexing to achieve higher network utilization at the expense of occasionally dropping or excessively delaying packets. Previous approaches to providing such guarantees utilize explicit stochastic properties of the arrival processes and calculate or approximate quantities such as the steady state buffer overflow probability (see <ref> [6, 9, 11, 13, 16, 24] </ref> for examples). For an approach to be used as an admission control algorithm, it must be able to efficiently calculate the loss and delay-bound-violation probability for a new source, given the traffic specifications and performance requirements of all the currently established connections. <p> We term the new approach Hybrid Bounding Interval Dependent (H-BIND) because it combines the deterministic modeling techniques of the D-BIND model with the stochastic aggregation approaches of <ref> [16, 24] </ref>. The approach will be shown to be fully enforceable by the network, and to provide end-to-end statistical performance guarantees to heterogeneous sources with heterogeneous QoS requirements. <p> This is possible because the same traffic descriptor is used by all streams that obtain a QoS guarantee. Finally, the admission control calculations can be performed relatively quickly and avoid the convolutions of <ref> [16, 24] </ref>. We evaluate the performance of the H-BIND admission control algorithm using a 28-minute trace of MPEG compressed video. <p> First, Equation (4) requires knowledge of a family of bounding distributions for each traffic stream. While these distributions can be parameterized using techniques such as those in <ref> [24] </ref>, even in [24], the sum of random variables in Equation (4) must be calculated via a convolution or a Fast Fourier Transform, which may be too costly. <p> First, Equation (4) requires knowledge of a family of bounding distributions for each traffic stream.

Delay-jitter control decouples the network nodes by reconstructing the sources' original traffic pattern at each hop, effectively absorbing the delay-jitter introduced by the previous hop. <p> Delay-jitter control decouples the network nodes by reconstructing the sources' original traffic pattern at each hop, effectively absorbing the delay-jitter introduced by the previous hop. For example, <ref> [24] </ref> showed that if a connection traverses a path of servers with delay-jitter controlling regulators, the traffic pattern at the input of each scheduler is exactly the same as that at the entrance to the network. This allows us to analyze each scheduler using the same traffic characterization.
