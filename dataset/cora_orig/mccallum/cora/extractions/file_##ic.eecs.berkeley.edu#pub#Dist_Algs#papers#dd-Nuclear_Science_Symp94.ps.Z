Title: Measurement and Tridimensional Simulation of Silicon Pixel Detector Capacitance  
Author: Luciano Bosisio Francesco Forti Eric Tomacruz 
Abstract: We report on a study of the capacitance of silicon pixel detectors to be used as tracking devices for high energy physics experiments. The pixel capacitance matrix plays an important role in system design issues, like preamplifier matching and cross-talk among pixels. Test results on 100 fi 100 m 2 pixels are compared with data obtained with a massively parallel tridimensional simulation code needed to account for the intrinsically 3D nature of the pixel structure.

Reference-contexts: The pixel capacitances play a crucial role in the system design, since they determine the noise and cross-talk of the detector. To our knowledge, a great amount of measurements and simulations have been performed for strip detectors <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, but neither data nor simulations exist for small size pixel detectors. In this paper we present the first results of a coordinated program of measurements and simulations aimed at modeling the pixel capacitances for varying geometries.

Reference-contexts: The other side of the 300 m thick wafer has an n + -implant that serves as a back contact. The devices were fabricated using the process for double-sided strip detectors (see <ref> [3] </ref> for details) in the spare area at the periphery of the wafer. We will be mainly concerned with the surface capacitances C x and C xy defined in Fig. 1, since the back capacitance is simply determined by the area of the pixel divided fl L.

Reference-contexts: There are basically three possible approaches to the problem: * the Charge Partitioning method (CP) * the Fourier Decomposition of transient analysis (FD) * the Sinusoidal Steady State Analysis (S 3 A) We will only describe the CP method, and refer the interested reader to the work of Laux <ref> [4] </ref>. In the CP method, after the basic solution is found, a voltage step V j is applied to the electrode j and the new, slightly modified, DC solution is calculated.

Reference-contexts: For this association to be effective, a device dependent physical insight is needed, preventing this method from being of general applicability. In our case the charge region boundaries were placed in the middle of the gaps between pixels. A 3-D drift-diffusion simulator <ref> [5] </ref> implemented on a Connection Machine 2 (CM-2) is used to solve for the DC solution and the small signal response. The CM-2 is a massively parallel computer with up to 65536 bit-serial processors running on a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) mode. <p> The CM-2 is a massively parallel computer with up to 65536 bit-serial processors running on a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) mode. This device simulator implementation gives the computational power needed for 3-D capacitance simulation. It has been shown in <ref> [5] </ref> that the CM-2 algorithm exceeds vector supercomputer performance for problems greater than 15,000 grid nodes. For most simulations we used a grid of 16fi16fi16 points, corresponding to 4,096 grid points, each associated with a different processor.

Reference-contexts: The simulation of the separate contributions of C x and C xy does not for the moment agree very well with the data, the reason lying in the uncertainties in the definition of the charge region. As discussed in <ref> [7] </ref> for a MOS transistor, when the charge region boundary lies in an undepleted zone | which is the case of the gap between pixels when the fixed oxide charge is present | its exact placement can become critical and undermine the capacitance simulation.
