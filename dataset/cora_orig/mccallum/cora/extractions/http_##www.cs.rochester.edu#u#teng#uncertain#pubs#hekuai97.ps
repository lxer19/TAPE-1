Title: Probabilistic Acceptance  
Author: Henry E. Kyburg, Jr. 
Degree: Computer Science and Philosophy  
Address: Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA  
Affiliation: University of  
Abstract: The idea of fully accepting statements when the evidence has rendered them probable enough faces a number of difficulties. We leave the interpretation of probability largely open, but attempt to suggest a contextual approach to full belief. We show that the difficulties of probabilistic acceptance are not as severe as they are sometimes painted, and that though there are oddities associated with probabilistic acceptance they are in some instances less awkward than the difficulties associated with other nonmonotonic formalisms. We show that the structure at which we arrive provides a natural home for statistical inference.

Reference-contexts: As natural as high probability is as a ground for tentative acceptance, probabilistic acceptance has received a lot of bad press. It has generally been dismissed as a ground of acceptance in the nonmonotonic world (except when "high" is taken to mean arbitrarily close to 1.0 <ref> [ Adams, 1986; Geffner and Pearl, 1990 ] </ref> .) This has been so for a number of reasons. 3.1 The Lack of Statistics. <p> A number of writers <ref> [ Pearl, 1992; Adams, 1986; Geffner and Pearl, 1990 ] </ref> have followed this line, but usually with the constraint that to justify acceptance, the conditional probability of S given T must be arbitrarily close to 1.0.

Reference-contexts: We are permitted to say we obtained a sample falling into R, and that R has such and such nice properties. We are not permitted to say that, relative to this evidence, the probability that H is false is less than *. As Birnbaum <ref> [ Birnbaum, 1969 ] </ref> has pointed out, it is easy to avoid saying this, but it is very hard not to think it. There are some cautions, however. There is a gap between a long run frequency and epistemic probability.

Reference-contexts: Clearly we intend it to be tentative, or nonmonotonic. On the other hand, acceptance must be distinguished from merely having a certain degree of belief. One suggestion <ref> [ Braithwaite, 1946 ] </ref> is that to accept a proposition is to be prepared to act on the basis of its truth, as opposed to being prepared to bet on its truth.

Reference-contexts: Classical statistical inference takes as its fundamental mechanism the rejection of a statistical hypothesis under certain prespecified conditions. Although in classical statistics probability is emphatically identified with frequencies [ Neyman, 1950 ] , or the conceptual counterparts of frequencies <ref> [ Cramer, 1951 ] </ref> , or set measures in a sample space [ Lindgren, 1976 ] , and although many statisticians strongly deny that "rejecting" H amounts to "accepting" :H, much of classical statistics translates smoothly into the formalism of purely probabilistic acceptance.

Reference-contexts: But he locates the trouble in stochastic dependence. That ticket i loses increases the probability that ticket j will win. Pollock therefore draws a distinction between the paradox of the preface [ Makin-son, 1965 ] and the lottery paradox. But as Goodwin and Neufeld have shown <ref> [ Goodwin and Neufeld, 1996 ] </ref> , many State and Provincial lotteries have a structure that supports a lottery paradox argument despite independence of the tickets. The distinction between the lottery and the preface doesn't do what Pollock wants it to do.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, there are many ways of tying the next toss of that special coin to the reported and experimental history of coin tosses in general. One way is simply to point out that, epistemically, the toss described is, like the first toss, merely the toss of a coin <ref> [ Kyburg, 1961 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: This doesn't make them totally useless: they represent the way things could be, and that may be worth taking account of. It is not the same, however, as taking something, tentatively, to be the case, in the sense that you could act on it. In <ref> [ Kyburg, 1974 ] </ref> bodies of knowledge were allowed to be inconsistent and deductively closed maximal consistent subsets of these bodies of knowledge were used as an auxiliary construction for defining randomness and, subsequently, probability.

Reference-contexts: In general there are many ways of tying an event to a sequence of events whose stochastic properties are directly or indirectly known. The problem of fixing on a single way is the problem of the reference class <ref> [ Kyburg, 1983 ] </ref> . We cannot pretend that this problem has been definitively solved, but it is quite clear that until it is, it is premature to claim that there is a lack of statistics relevant to any given sentence. 3.2 Inconsistency. <p> There are cases | for example such cases arise in epidemiology | where determining this class can be controversial. What is involved here is the problem of choosing the right reference class, a knotty and unsolved problem that has only begun to be explored <ref> [ Kyburg, 1983 ] </ref> . Furthermore we must take account of the niceties of negation.

Reference-contexts: Another way to put this is to say that within this range of circumstances, we do not take an accepted proposition as a suitable matter for a bet <ref> [ Kyburg, 1988 ] </ref> . For example, suppose that in the decisions you face in a certain class of circumstances the ratio of costs to benefits always lies between 1 : 3 and 3 : 1.

Reference-contexts: There is, however, a computational cost involved. For present purposes, we have chosen to stand aside from the Bayesian/non-Bayesian debate. (See [ Cheese-man, 1988 ] and <ref> [ Kyburg, 1994 ] </ref> .) 6 Problems and Questions We are left with a number of important questions. 1. Assuming that acceptance is useful on some occasions, it remains to be seen whether purely probabilistic acceptance, as outlined here, is as useful as other forms of nonmonotonic acceptance.

Reference-contexts: Most of them have taken the form of holding to the demand that the set of statements we accept be consistent, and adding conditions to the probabilistic acceptance rule in order to ensure that this demand is satisfied. Keith Lehrer <ref> [ Lehrer, 1975 ] </ref> proposed that we ensure consistency by allowing the acceptance of a high probability sentence S only when its probability is positively higher than that of any alternative.

Reference: [ Levi, 1967 ] <author> Isaac Levi. </author> <title> Gambling with Truth. </title> <address> Knopf, New York., </address> <year> 1967. </year>
Reference-contexts: The distinction between the lottery and the preface doesn't do what Pollock wants it to do. Isaac Levi <ref> [ Levi, 1967 ] </ref> adopts principles that assure that both high probability and consistency are assured. But the requirement of consistency is built quite directly into his acceptance rules. One simple possibility is to accept statements whose probabilities are high, so long as they do not introduce inconsistency.

Reference-contexts: Ever since the influential paper by Hayes and Mc-Carthy <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> , it has been claimed that there are many natural instances of non-monotonic inference that cannot be a matter of probability, "since the required statistical data are not available to the agent." Others have voiced similar arguments.

Reference-contexts: We have preserved consistency, but only with a loss of generality (we can no longer deal with the equiprobable case) and at a cost of implausibility: the probability that the N th ticket will win may be extremely low; yet we may accept it! John Pollock <ref> [ Pollock, 1990 ] </ref> offers a different solution. Like Lehrer, he thinks we should not accept any of the statements of the form ticket i will lose in the fair lottery. But he locates the trouble in stochastic dependence.

Reference-contexts: Teng <ref> [ Teng, 1996b ] </ref> provides a treatment that avoids this problem by taking account of the accepted statements in computing the probability of a given statement. Thus we accept the statement that ticket i will not win.
