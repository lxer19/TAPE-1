Title: A Hybrid System for Diagnosing Multiple Disorders

Abstract: This paper investigates the advantages of introducing feedback between the processes of automated medical diagnosis and automated diagnostic-knowledge acquisition. Experimental results show that a diagnostic system with such feedback is capable of an efficiency/accuracy tradeoff when applied to the problem of diagnosing multiple disorders. A primary feature of this work is a new mechanism, called the "diagnostic-unit" representation, for remembering results of previous diagnoses. The diagnostic-unit representation is explicitly tailored to capture the most likely relationships between disorders and clusters of findings. Unlike typical bipartite "If-Then" representations, the diagnostic-unit representation uses a general graph representation to efficiently represent complex causal relationships between disorders and clusters of findings. In addition to the basic diagnostic-unit concept, this paper presents experience-based strategies for incrementally deriving and updating diagnostic units and the various relationships between them. Techniques for selecting diagnostic units relevant to a given problem and then combining them to generate solutions are also described.

Reference-contexts: Such a graph is called a diagnostically-operative causal graph, or doc graph. Detailed formal definitions of diagnostic units, of links between diagnostic units, and of doc graphs can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2 Knowledge Incorporation Process This subsection addresses the issue of how to acquire diagnostic units and various relationships between them. One approach would be manual compilation by interviewing expert physicians. It is, however, expensive and time-consuming.

Reference-contexts: For Hydi's association-based solver, decompositional abduc-tive diagnosis (for expository convenience, called dad) was implemented that selects relevant diagnostic units based on deep matching adaptation, and constructs a diagnostic solution by applying the specificity-reflected similarity metric and the dependency-guided picking method. Detailed algorithms for dad can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Hydi performs hybrid reasoning to solve diagnostic problems. The central idea of hybrid reasoning is that for a diagnostic problem, dad is first performed to solve the problem; if a diagnostic solution generated by dad is not acceptable, then Hf is called to solve the problem.

Each black rect angular node represents an elemental disorder. Elemental disorders are either pathophysiologic states defined at a level needed for differential diagnosis or pathophys-iologic states that do not require any further causes <ref> [9] </ref>. Oval nodes represent intermediate states. Intermediate states are the rest of pathophysiologic states. Rectangular nodes represent findings. Links are causal links that represent direct causal relations between the clinical entities represented by the corresponding nodes. <p> The intention is to take advantage of the robustness of causal-model-based reasoning and the efficiency of association-based reasoning. Since the focus of this research is not on the specifics of causal-model-based reasoning, this research reuses an existing probabilistic causal-model-based system, Hf, as cms. Hf <ref> [9] </ref> is a prob-abilistic causal-model-based system for heart failure diagnosis. A decompositional abductive diagnosis approach, which is the main topic of this research, is used for as. Hydi has two knowledge bases. One is the causal knowledge base, K CMS , that contains domain causal knowledge.
