Abstract: The energy consumption due to I/O pins is a substantial part of the overall chip consumption. This paper gives an overview of the Working Zone Encoding (WZE) method for encoding for low power the external address and data buses, based on the conjecture that programs favor a few working zones of their address space at each instant. In such cases, the method identifies these zones and sends through the address (data) bus only the offset of this reference (data value) with respect to the previous reference (data value) to that zone, along with an identifier of the current working zone. This is combined with a one-hot encoding for the offset. * extension of the technique for the data bus to some multimedia applications which are characterized by having packed bytes in a word. For two typical applications, the data-only data bus and data-only address bus I/O activity is reduced by 74% and 51% with respect to the unencoded case, and by 68% and 33% with respect the best of the rest of the encoding techniques.

Reference-contexts: We have done some preliminary evaluations for two applications: image alpha blending and motion estimation. Both use color images where a pixel is composed of three bytes that specify the three main colors; a pixel is read or written per memory reference. 4.1 Image Alpha Blending Alpha Blending <ref> [1] </ref> is used for imaging effects to merge two images together, weighting one image more than the other.

Reference-contexts: Because of the particular features of these applications, we explore the possibility of special modifi cations to the encoding technique for the data bus. 1.1 Previous work Several encoding techniques for reduced bus activity have been reported, such as one-hot [6], Gray [7], bus-invert [13], T0 and combined bus-invert/T0 <ref> [5] </ref>, and inc-xor and dbm-vbm [12]. One-hot encoding results in a reduced activity because only two bits toggle when the value changes. However, it requires a number of wires equal to the number of values encoded, so that it is not practical for typical buses. <p> An extra wire is used to carry this polarity information. For uniform and independent distributions, this encoding technique works better when the bit-width of the value to be sent is divided into smaller groups and each one encoded independently. The bus-invert technique has been combined with T0 in <ref> [5] </ref>, thus obtaining more activity reduction than each of the techniques by itself. A source-coding framework is proposed in [12] as well as some specific codes. The scheme is based on obtaining a prediction function and a prediction error.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, an offset with respect to the previous address for that zone is sent, together with a zone identifier. The offset is encoded so as to reduce the activity of the address bus. This scheme is extended to the data bus <ref> [8] </ref> by noticing that the data for successive accesses to a working zone frequently differ also by a small amount, so that it is effective also to send the offset. <p> In this paper we give an overview of the WZE technique and summarize previous work on the topic; this material is similar to that of <ref> [8] </ref> and should give the reader a reasonable understanding of the method. For more details consult [10, 11]. <p> Afterwards, an extension of the WZE technique <ref> [8] </ref> is reviewed which allows the data bus to be encoded by reusing a large portion of the hardware already used to encode the address bus. The basis of the WZE technique is as follows: 1.

In the T0 encoding an additional wire is used to indicate the consecutive access mode, and no activity is required in the bus. The bus-invert method <ref> [13] </ref> consists on sending either the value itself or its bit-wise complement, depending on which would result in fewer transitions. An extra wire is used to carry this polarity information.

Reference-contexts: Since the one-hot code produces two transitions if the previous reference was also in the one-hot code and an average of n=2 transitions when the previous reference is arbitrary, the number of transitions is reduced by using a transition-signaling code <ref> [14] </ref>. In this case, before sending the reference through the bus an XOR operation is performed with the previous value sent, always resulting in one tran sition. 4. One value can be sent using a 0-hot code, which with transition signaling produces zero transitions.
