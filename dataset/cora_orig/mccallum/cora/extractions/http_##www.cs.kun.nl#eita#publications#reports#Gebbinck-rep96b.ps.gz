Abstract: An accurate crop area estimation method based on satellite remote sensing imagery is needed to manage the agricultural subsidy system of the European Union. The area estimator can use either classification, which allocates a pixel to a single class, or decomposition, which divides a pixel between several classes, to determine the ground cover type(s) a pixel is composed of. While in early days classification was much used, recently the decomposition approach has gained more interest, however, only on a per pixel basis. In a previous study, we developed the data-driven decomposition method, which used spatial information to guide the decomposition process; on artificial Landsat-TM images this method proved to be far more accurate than techniques based on classification or pixel-based decomposition. To investigate whether data-driven decomposition also results in an improved area estimation when using real satellite images, the area of 17 agricultural lots was determined from a large scale topographical map. After co-registration with a corresponding Landsat-TM image, application of data-driven decomposition gave an estimation that was equally or more accurate than the estimates of a similar method based on classification in 14 of the 17 cases. Furthermore, data-driven classification also showed to be better suited for handling the small boundary structures that separated the agricultural fields. These results suggest that the accuracy of data-driven decomposition is higher than that of an area estimator based on classification when dealing with agricultural fields.
