Title: Fast Fourier Transforms for Wreath Products

Abstract: In this paper fast Fourier transform algorithms (FFT's) are constructed for wreath products of the form G[S n ]. Examples of interest include the hyperoctahedral groups B n (the symmetry groups of the n-cube) as well as more generally A[S n ] for any abelian groups A and also the full wreath products S m [S n ] and their iterates, often identified as automorphism groups of spherically homogeneous rooted trees. In general, direct computation of the discrete Fourier transform for any finite group H requires jHj 2 operations. The algorithms presented in this paper provide substantial speed-ups for general wreath products G[S n ], which for the particular examples mentioned above reduce the jHj 2 bound to O(jHj log 4 jHj). Thus new classes of finite groups of close to minimal linear complexity are obtained. Applications to data analysis, signal processing and molecular spectroscopy are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Wreath products are of interest in data analysis as the automorphism groups of nested designs. FFT's for wreath products will greatly facilitate the computation of the analysis of variance of data on a nested design for statistical models which assume symmetry invariant covariance <ref> [1, 21] </ref>. Similarly, efficient computation of spectral analysis for such data requires such FFT's [14]. Wreath products are also the symmetry groups of many classes of molecules particularly so-called "non-rigid" molecules. <p> The groups G n and L are identified with the subgroups f <ref> [a; 1] </ref> j a 2 G n g and f [e; ] j 2 Lg respectively. It is easy to check that G n is a normal subgroup of G [L] so that G [L] is a semidirect product of G n by L, denoted as G n o L. <p> Each of the k nodes at distance 1 from the root correspond to a block containing m plots (in natural correspondence with the children of these nodes). The relevant statistical automorphism group allows permutations by blocks followed by any permutation within a block (cf. <ref> [1, 31] </ref>), so is 18 precisely S m [S k ]. Repeated nesting in turn is equivalent to further branching of the tree with corresponding wreath product as symmetry group. For a fuller description of the statistical motivation for these designs see [31]. <p> To cite but a few examples, this is the case in the spectral analysis approach (cf. [14], esp. Chapters 7 and 8 and [20]), ANOVA under the assumption of symmetry-invariant covariance (cf. [21]) as well as ANOVA under the assumption of randomized treatment assignment with symmetry (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>). The orthogonal decomposition of L (X m ) under the assumption of G m -invariance takes the form of the isotypic decomposition with possible further decomposition into irreducibles.

Reference-contexts: Remark 3. Babai and Ronyai have shown that a traversal for ^ G can always be constructed in deterministic polynomial time <ref> [3] </ref>. In the special case of S n , highly efficient algorithms exist to construct particular sets of representations, Young's orthogonal form or seminormal form, which are used in the algorithms described in the coming sections.

Reference-contexts: Wreath products are also the symmetry groups of many classes of molecules particularly so-called "non-rigid" molecules. Here the development of the adapted bases necessary for FFT's turns out to be useful for efficient computation for NMR spectroscopy <ref> [4] </ref>. Lastly, nonabelian FFT's have been proposed as potential approximants to Karhunen-Loeve filters [23, 24, 26]. By exhibiting a new class of nonabelian groups with close to optimal DFT algorithms, new possibilities for signal estimation and data compression are displayed. The organization of this paper is as follows. <p> In particular, direct products of wreath products of the form Z=mZ [S n ] and their iterates have been identified as the symmetry groups of "non-rigid" molecules [38] and their induced 21 permutation action on the atoms in these molecules is shown to commute with the NMR Hamiltonian <ref> [4] </ref>. In the most elementary setting, this permutation action is effectively the action of Z=mZ [S n ] on the leaves of the spherically homogeneous tree X m;n (cf. Figure 2). Analysis of this action is analogous to that of Section 5.1.

Reference-contexts: In particular, it is now known that many families of nonabelian groups also possess O (jGj log jGj) FFT's. This includes the symmetric groups [11], metabelian groups [10, 33] and more generally, supersolvable groups <ref> [5] </ref>.

This technique has been the key to some of the FFT's developed for S n [15, 11] as well as for supersolvable groups <ref> [5] </ref>. For computational purposes, strict subgroup-adaptability is not required. In particular, if a restricted representation differs from a direct sum only by a reordering of basis vectors, the complexity remains essentially unchanged. For this reason the following defintion is useful. Definition 3 Let all notation be as in Definition 2.

Reference-contexts: When this approach is adopted, the complexity of the DFT can be measured as the c-linear complexity of the DFT matrix <ref> [6] </ref>. The c-linear complexity of a group G, is defined to be the minimum c-linear complexity of any DFT matrix for G. The results stated here can all be translated into statements about the 2-linear complexity of wreath products. <p> The recurrence (2), presented in [15] and [11], demonstrates the usefulness of adapted bases for constructing FFT's. The natural generalization of this approach is the notion of 4 a tower-adapted basis (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>, Chapter 7) in which traversals are determined for each subgroup within a tower of subgroups G = G 0 &gt; G 1 &gt; &gt; G k = f1g such that traversals are successively adapted. <p> for the task. (It is not too hard to see that the FFT explained in Theorem 2 can be written as a matrix factorization, if the FFT chosen for G is described as such.) As the matrix which computes the inverse transform is effectively the "transpose" of the DFT, (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>, Theorem 1), the complexity of a fast inversion performed by transposing the FFT is of the same order ([8], [6], Theorem 3). This is recorded in the following Theorem. <p> as a matrix factorization, if the FFT chosen for G is described as such.) As the matrix which computes the inverse transform is effectively the "transpose" of the DFT, (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>, Theorem 1), the complexity of a fast inversion performed by transposing the FFT is of the same order ([8], [6], Theorem 3). This is recorded in the following Theorem. Theorem 5 The bounds stated in Theorems 2 and 3, also give upper bounds on the com plexity of computing the inverse Fourier transform in the various cases.

Intriguing recent work of Holmes <ref> [23] </ref>, [24], Trachtenberg, Karpovsky [26] and others have proposed that certain DFT's for nonabelian (noncommutative) groups may be employed as potential approximants of the Karhunen-Loeve transform for particular classes of stochastic signals. To formulate the problem, suppose a given problem of signal estimation involves N -dimensional data. <p> Given the computational advantages of wreath product transforms, it is of interest to determine classes of stochastic signals for which the wreath product FFT's act as nearly optimal filters. 5.2.3 Data compression Holmes also points out <ref> [23] </ref> that nonabelian FFT's provide interesting possibilities for data compression. To explain his ideas, again assume N -dimensional data is given by a signal x of constant (although not necessarily stationary) variance and let x denote the associated covariance matrix.

Now recall that for any partition ` m, the matrices (jj + 1) for 1 j m 1 are sparse with at most 15 2d nonzero entries (eg. <ref> [25] </ref>). Thus, any () for any 2 S m can be written as a product of at most m 2 such sparse matrices. <p> If n = 0, then this is simply the well known statement that the representation of S m 0 on S m 0 =S m 0 1 is multiplicity-free (see e.g. <ref> [25] </ref>).

The general idea is that symmetry-invariant properties are interesting and lead to physically intersting results. The symmetry of interest may be nuclear (e.g. spin-symmetry) time-symmetry, or geometric symmetry, just to name a few examples.

Reference-contexts: Each of the k nodes at distance 1 from the root correspond to a block containing m plots (in natural correspondence with the children of these nodes). The relevant statistical automorphism group allows permutations by blocks followed by any permutation within a block (cf. <ref> [1, 31] </ref>), so is 18 precisely S m [S k ]. Repeated nesting in turn is equivalent to further branching of the tree with corresponding wreath product as symmetry group.

Reference-contexts: This is recorded in the following Theorem. Theorem 5 The bounds stated in Theorems 2 and 3, also give upper bounds on the com plexity of computing the inverse Fourier transform in the various cases. A different constructive approach to the computation of Fourier inversion may be found in <ref> [32] </ref>. Application of the methods explained there in concert with the sparse factorization of the representations at the coset representatives will yield a similar complexity result. Fast forward and inverse transforms imply the existence of a fast convolution algorithm as well [11, 15].

Success in their construction would then pave the way to FFT's as obtained in Section 4.
