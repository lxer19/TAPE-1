Abstract: University of Florida TR 92-23 Abstract Preplaced modules may be flipped to improve performance and/or routability. We show that several versions of the module flipping problem are NP-hard. We propose algorithms to obtain module orientations that minimize the total wire length for module matrix and standard cell models. Additionally, we propose a heuristic to flip modules so as to minimize the length of the longest signal path. The results of experiments performed with this heuristic are also presented.

Reference-contexts: Yamada and Liu [YAMA88] propose an analytical method to obtain suboptimal solutions for ETLF. This algorithm is shown (experimentally) to be competitive with hill-climbing and simulated annealing algorithms for ETLF. In [LIBE89], Libeskind-Hadas and Liu propose neural network formulations for ETLF and ETLR. Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref> show that ETLF is linearly solvable for the case when the modules are arranged as a matrix in which wires connect only pairs of modules that are in adjacent columns. <p> They also show that ETLF is polynomially solvable for standard cell designs in which wires connect modules in adjacent columns and either the number of module columns is two or the number of modules dependent on any other module is bounded by some constant. Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref> also evaluate a simple greedy heuristic that attempts to minimize ETL by flipping modules. Experimental results reported by them indicate this heuristic is superior to the neural network approach of [LIBE89]. The problem of minimizing the maximum estimated wire length was studied by Chong and Sahni [CHON91]. <p> Without the independence theorem, one needs to consider up to 4 n possible module orientation sets. 3.2 Module Matrix Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref> have developed an algorithm that solves ETLF for an m n matrix of modules with the property that wires connect pairs of modules in adjacent columns only (Figure 10). <p> Their algorithm has complexity O (mn+w) where w is the number of wires. _______________________________________________________________________________ 17 In this section, we generalize the module matrix model of <ref> [CHON92] </ref>. We permit wires to connect any pair of modules. However if a wire connects two modules in the same row or column, then we limit the number of intermediate modules to k -1. <p> Thus, when k =1 wires between modules in the same row or column are confined to be between adjacent modules. Figure 11 shows possible matrix modules for the cases k =1 and 2. _______________________________________________________________________________ ________________________ _________________________ _________________________ ____________ Notice that we permit intracolumn wires while the model of <ref> [CHON92] </ref> does not. Also, note that when wires may connect modules of the same row or column that are arbitrarily far apart, the ETLF problem is NP-hard even when n =1 or m=1 (Theorems 4 and 5). <p> Consequently, we do not expect to find a polynomial time algorithm for our model (i.e., polynomial in, n, m, w, and k). The algorithm we develop has complexity O (mn2 k +w). Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref> have shown that for their matrix model ETLF could be solved by obtaining optimal orientations for each row of modules while arbitrarily selecting the orientations of modules in other rows. That is, they proved that the procedure of Figure 12 minimizes the estimated total wire length. <p> For each module, use the orientation determined in line 4. _______________________________________________________________________________ Using the techniques of Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref>, one may show that for our module matrix model, the total vertical wire length is minimized by the algorithm of Figure 13 and the total horizontal wire length is minimized by the algorithm of Figure 14. _______________________________________________________________________________ 1. arbitrarily select an orientation for each module ; 2. for r := <p> To solve the n column optimization problems also takes O (mn2 k +w) time. So, the overall time needed to obtain the optimal orientations for our module matrix model is O (mn2 k +w). The case considered in <ref> [CHON92] </ref> is a special case of our model with k =1. The asymptotic complexity of our algorithm for the case k =1 is the same as that of the algorithm of [CHON92]. 3.3 Standard Cells Chong and Sahni [CHON92] considered the ETLF problem for standard cell designs in which modules are <p> The case considered in <ref> [CHON92] </ref> is a special case of our model with k =1.

This is not so for the algorithm of <ref> [CHON92] </ref>. However, their algorithm is superior for designs in which the number of columns is small (small m) and k is also small. Note also that the complexity of our algorithm is independent of k. 21 Our standard cell algorithm employs dynamic programming.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms to obtain optimal solutions are proposed here. In Section 4, we propose a heuristic for the MaxDelay problem and evaluate it experimentally. 5 2 NP-hard Results To prove our NP-hard results, we use the following problems that are known to be NP-hard. 3SAT problem <ref> [GARE79] </ref> Input: A Boolean function I = C 1 , C 2 , ..., C m in n variables x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n . Each clause C i is the disjunction of exactly three literals. <p> Each clause C i is the disjunction of exactly three literals. Output: "Yes" iff there is a truth assignment for the n variables such that I = true. "No" otherwise. NE3SAT problem <ref> [GARE79] </ref> Input: Same as for 3SAT.

Reference-contexts: False paths, however, are not accounted for. Assume that the modules M 1 , M 2 , ..., M n have been numbered in topological order <ref> [HORO90] </ref>. So, if there is a path from M i to M j in the circuit graph, then i &lt;j. For each module M i and module orientation r, we compute two numbers InputDelay (i, r) and OutputDelay (i, r). <p> (i,r) + OutputDelay (i, r) = min - InputDelay (i, s) + OutputDelay (i, s) | s is an allowable orientation -. 23 The time required to obtain the initial module orientation is O (n +w) where n is the number of modules and w the number of wires (see <ref> [HORO90] </ref> for a linear time topological ordering algorithm). 4.2 Phase2: Refinement To reduce the maximum delay further, we follow a two step process. In step 1, we begin with a path, P L , of maximum delay.

Reference-contexts: Let ETL denote the estimated total wire length and let MEL denote the maximum estimated wire length (i.e., length of the longest wire). The problems of minimizing ETL and MEL by flipping modules have been studied by Yamada and Lin [YAMA88], Libeskind-Hadas and Liu <ref> [LIBE89] </ref>, and Chong and Sahni [CHON91 and 92]. All of these start with a preplaced circuit. It is assumed that modules may be flipped about their horizontal and/or vertical axes. Hence, there are four possible orientations of a module under flipping (Figure 1). <p> In both [YAMA88] and <ref> [LIBE89] </ref>, the Euclidean distance between wire end points is used to estimate wire length.

Note 4 that the ETLR proof of <ref> [LIBE89] </ref> comes close to having three rows of modules. This proof uses modules of different size. Our proof applies to the simpler case of equal size modules in a single row or single column. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to module rotation problems. <p> This is so even for single column or single row instances with equal size modules. 2. The ETLF problem is NP-hard for a single column of equal size modules even when only vertical flips are permitted. The ETLF proof of <ref> [LIBE89] </ref> uses modules of two different sizes. While most of these are placed in a single row arrangement, two modules are stacked into a column. <p> So, our ETLF proof applies to even simpler module layouts than does the proof of <ref> [LIBE89] </ref>. In Section 2, we also show that single column ETLF can be solved in linear time when only horizontal flips are permitted. In Section 3, we consider the ETLF problem for layouts that follow a module matrix model as well as for standard cell layouts.
