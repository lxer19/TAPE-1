Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying likely topics of texts by their position in the text. It describes the automated training and evaluation of an Optimal Position Policy, a method of locating the likely positions of topic-bearing sentences based on genre-specific regularities of discourse structure. This method can be used in applications such as information retrieval, routing, and text summarization.

Reference-contexts: sentences occurring under certain headings are positively relevant; and (2) topic sentences tend to occur very early or very late in a document and its paragraphs." However, since the paradigmatic discourse structure differs significantly over text genres and subject domains, the Position Method cannot be defined as straightforwardly as Baxendale's <ref> (Baxendale, 1958) </ref> title plus first and last sentences of each paragraph; it has to be tailored to genre and domain. <p> Furthermore, he did not trying out other possible combinations, such as the second and third paragraphs or the second-last paragraph. In order to determine where the important words are most likely to be found, Baxendale <ref> (Baxendale, 1958) </ref> conducted an investigation of a sample of 200 paragraphs. He found that in 85% of paragraphs the topic sentence was in the first sentence and in 7% the final one.

Reference-contexts: The text's title, for example, is a very informative position in most genres, as is the Abstract paragraph in scientific articles. Edmundson <ref> (Edmundson, 1969) </ref> defined the Position Method as follows: ". . . the machine-readable cues are cer tain general characteristics of the corpus provided by the skeletons of documents, i.e. headings and format. <p> This paper contains an analysis of the Position Method. We first discuss previous work, then in Section 3 describe the background studies and training of an Optimal Position Policy for a genre of texts, and in Section 4 describe its evaluation. 2 Related Work Edmundson's <ref> (Edmundson, 1969) </ref> laid the groundwork for the Position Method. He introduced four clues for identifying significant words (topics) in a text. Among them, Title and Location are related to the Position Method.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, no systematic study has yet been performed, though some variant of it has been used in computational studies (see for example (Edmundson, 1969; Luhn, 1958; Baxendale, 1958)), writing-education classes (for example, (Sjostrom and Hare, 1984)), and has been the subject of cognitive psychological verification <ref> (Kieras, 1985) </ref>. This paper contains an analysis of the Position Method. <p> tf.idf-based weighting schemes do not cluster in the first and the last sentences of paragraphs or in paragraphs that consist of a single sentence, at least not to such an extent that such a feature could be used in the preparation of indices for Information Retrieval purposes." In contrast, Kieras <ref> (Kieras, 1985) </ref> in psychological studies confirmed the importance of the position of a mention within a text. 3 Training the Rules 3.1 Background The purposes of our study are to clarify these contradictions, to test the abovementioned intuitions and results, and to verify the hypothesis that the importance of a sentence
