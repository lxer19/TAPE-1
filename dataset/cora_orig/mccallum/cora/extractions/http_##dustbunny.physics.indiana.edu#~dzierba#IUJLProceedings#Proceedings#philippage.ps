Abstract: The well-known selection rule for the strong decays of hybrid mesons is noted to be more general than specific models. We report a detailed calculation in two flux-tube models of the photoproduction of hybrid mesons via meson exchange. The importance of translating estimates for the couplings of states produced at BNL and VES to photoproduction couplings is emphasized. We indicate that diffractive photoproduction of hybrids can possibly be significant at TJNAF.

Reference-contexts: Thus if the final state mesons have different spatial wave functions, we expect breaking of the selection rule. This "lifting of suppression" can be rigorously defined in flux-tube models (see Eq. 2 below) and for !; ; ! and was estimated to be 20% <ref> [9] </ref>. For final states with (almost) identical wave functions like ; !! and ! the selection rule remains unbroken. <p> We hence conclude that meson exchange can be a significant production mechanism for hybrids <ref> [9] </ref>. Photoproduction of hybrid mesons at an upgraded Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at TJNAF could hence be significant, due to the predominance of exchange at CEBAF's energy [10]. <p> It is of significant interest that an independent study of the decay modes of some of these states finds evidence that (1450); (1700) and !(1420) can be regarded as mixtures of hybrids and conventional mesons <ref> [9, 18] </ref>. This may indicate that hybrids have already been observed in diffrac-tive photoproduction.
