Abstract: This paper introduces 'Competition for Attention' as a conceptual design paradigm for agent-based multi-media applications. Our aim is to allow for the relative independent development of information services, on the one hand, and value-added agent-based services on the other, and to enable their smooth integration in a particular on-line application. The underlying and long-term objective is to deal in a principled way with the scaling problem, allowing for agent-based applications with hundreds to millions of active agents. Although we have not yet fully realized these objectives, the paper describes three phases of an existing practical application that demonstrates the step that we have taken toward this goal. The application is an on-line WWW service for Brussels summer movie festival Ecran Total. In three consecutive years, three agent-based applications have been developed with increasingly enhanced methodological and technical support for realizing the Competition for Attention paradigm.

Our work focuses on designing interactive applications, rather than closed multi-agent systems, and with a fundamental commitment to radical information push models.

Reference-contexts: Basically, the problem we address is the following: how do agents that are embedded in large societieshundreds to millions of agentsfocus the enormous potential for interaction with others towards the most productive encounters? In this sense our work is similar in spirit to <ref> [7] </ref>. Competition for attention is one element of our solution. It works within a group of agents that are committed to interact with eachother. A second mechanism, we call it interest-based navigation, is needed to locate the best potential of successful interactions.

Reference-contexts: For the moment, this scale is not really an issue. There are relatively few software agents active and often they are bound to particular applications, assisting the users in working with complex pieces of software (editors, mail programs) <ref> [8] </ref>. When multiple agents are involved these are carefully designed together to rely on eachother's features (e.g. FireFly) This, however, does not cover the full potential of the notion of software agent and it is, in our opinion, definitely not what future agent-based applications will look like.

Reference-contexts: Most systems that take into account the context of the user to date focus on the least evolving contextual dimension, i.e. general user characteristics ( e.g. whether she is a novice or expert user) <ref> [9] </ref>. However, the more contextual parameters a system can take into account, the more context sensitive it will be. The present experiment focuses on a highly dynamic contextual parameter: the teleological features -the user's topic preferences and goals. <p> Another contribution is the direction of context-sensitive navigation points, based on natural language, which significantly extends on flexible text generation work <ref> [9] </ref>. From a technological point of view we have developed a robust framework for incremental and scalable design of agent-based multi-media applications. This architecture has shown broader applicability in the context of agent-based multi-media catalogues [11].

Reference-contexts: The idea of competition for attention is obviously an outcome of this bias. We believe that the Ecran series of servers has demonstrated the value of this approach for designing complex and evolving multi-media applications with an open collection of agents active in them (compare <ref> [10] </ref>. Another contribution is the direction of context-sensitive navigation points, based on natural language, which significantly extends on flexible text generation work [9].

Reference-contexts: The first approach, i.e. when measures can be designed, will lead to better performance more rapidly. However, the robustness with respect to unforeseen situations, changes in the information- or navigation structure, and in the 2 A related one is described in <ref> [11] </ref>. set of agents present in the application may be compromised. On the other hand, the dynamic approach implies that the system may only asymptotically exhibit interesting behavior. Examples of the first approach can be found in the Ecran'96 server. <p> From a technological point of view we have developed a robust framework for incremental and scalable design of agent-based multi-media applications.
