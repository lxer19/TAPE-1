Abstract: We propose a private-key cryptosystem and a protocol for key agreement by public discussion that are unconditionally secure based on the sole assumption that an adversary's memory capacity is limited. No assumption about her computing power is made. The scenario assumes that a random bit string of length slightly larger than the adversary's memory capacity can be received by all parties. The random bit string can for instance be broadcast by a satellite or over an optical network, or transmitted over an insecure channel between the communicating parties. The proposed schemes require very high bandwidth but can nevertheless be practical.

Reference-contexts: The large size of the hash function that has to be communicated for privacy amplification can be reduced by using "almost universal" hash functions based on almost k-wise independent random variables that can be constructed efficiently <ref> [1] </ref>. Such functions g : X ! Y can be described with about 5 log jYj instead of log jX j bits. 7 Discussion Our results show that unconditional security can be based on assumptions about the adversary's available memory.

Reference-contexts: By applying privacy amplification <ref> [2] </ref>, Alice and Bob can then eliminate Eve's partial knowledge about the selected subset. (The random source does not have to be independent from the users, e.g. <p> Thus, a member of the 2-universal family can be specified with only n bits. 2-universal hash functions are also the main technique to concentrate the randomness inherent in a probability distribution by a result known in different contexts as Entropy Smoothing Theorem, Leftover Hash Lemma [14], or Privacy Amplification Theorem <ref> [2] </ref>. In cryptography, privacy amplification is used to extract a short secret key from shared information about which an adversary has partial knowledge. Assume Alice and Bob share a random variable W , while an eavesdropper Eve knows a correlated random variable V that summarizes her knowledge about W . <p> Using a public channel, which is susceptible to eavesdropping but immune to tampering, Alice and Bob wish to agree on a function g such that Eve knows nearly nothing about g (W ). The following theorem by Bennett, Brassard, Crepeau, and Maurer <ref> [2] </ref> shows that if Alice and Bob choose g at random from a universal hash function G : W ! Y for suitable Y, then Eve's information about Y = g (W ) is negligible. Theorem 1 ([2]).

Reference-contexts: The following two primitives are perhaps the most realistic mechanisms proposed so far for limiting the information available to the adversary. Quantum Channel: Quantum cryptography was developed mainly by Bennett and Brassard during the 1980's <ref> [3] </ref>. It makes use of photons, i.e. polarized light pulses of very low intensity, that are transmitted over a fiber-optical channel. In the basic quantum key agreement protocol, this allows two parties to generate a secret key by communicating about the received values.

Reference-contexts: Such receivers could also allow for a greater capacity of the channel. The described protocols offer no resilience to errors on the broadcast channel. To take into account such errors, Alice and Bob can perform information reconciliation <ref> [4] </ref> on the selected subset. Methods for bounding the effect of this additional information provided to Eve are known [7]. The system rests on the gap between two technologies|fast communication and mass storage. Impressive future developments can be expected in both fields.

Reference-contexts: This is indeed the case, as was observed before by Zuckerman and others in the context of weak random sources [29, 21]. It is easy to show that the fraction of Eve's Shannon information corresponds to the expected value <ref> [5, Theorem 5.10] </ref>. However, privacy 6 amplification can only be applied if a lower bound on the Renyi entropy of order 2 of X S is known, which follows from the stronger bound on the min-entropy by Lemma 3.

Reference-contexts: Cachin has recently extended the theorem to Renyi entropy of order ff for any ff &gt; 1 <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Extracting a Secret Key from a Randomly Selected Subset We are now going to show how and why Alice and Bob can exploit the fact that an adversary Eve cannot store the complete output of a public random source that is broadcast to the participants.

Reference-contexts: The paper concludes with a discussion of the underlying assumptions and future perspectives. 2 Preliminaries We assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of entropy and the basic concepts of Shannon's information theory <ref> [9] </ref>. We repeat some fundamental definitions in this section and introduce the notation. All logarithms in this paper are to the base 2. The cardinality of a set S is denoted by jSj. A random variable X induces a probability distribution P X over an alphabet X . <p> This implies n i for i n=3 and 0 j i, from which the bound k X i &lt; n k X 2 i &lt; 2 n for any k n=3 follows immediately. The approximation of n by the binary entropy func tion <ref> [9] </ref>, 1 n+1 2 nh ( i n n ) , implies 2 2 nh () 2 n bnc X i ; where the second inequality follows from (2) for 1 3 .

Reference-contexts: The broadcast channel could be realized by a satellite. Typically, current communications satellites have a capacity of 1-10 Gbit/s [25]. Commercial satellite communications services offer broadcast data rates up to 0.8 Gbit/s at consumer electronics prices. Far more capacity is offered by fiber optical networks <ref> [12] </ref>. The test bed of the All-Optical Networking Consortium, for example, has a capacity of 1 Tbit/s and has been demonstrated at 130 Gbit/s (which was only limited by the number of sources available).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, tape libraries with capacities in the PByte range (1 PetaByte = 2 50 or about 10 15 bytes) are a major investment <ref> [13] </ref>. As an example for the private-key system, consider a 16 Gbit/s satellite channel that is used for one day, making n = 1:5 fi 10 15 . The size of the secret key K 0 is only 102 bit.

Reference-contexts: We start by repeating the construction of a sequence of pairwise independent random variables using universal hash functions. Universal hash functions were introduced by Carter and Wegman [8, 28] and have found many applications in theoretical computer science <ref> [15] </ref>. A 2-universal hash function is a set G of functions X ! Y if, for all distinct x 1 ; x 2 2 X , there are at most jGj=jYj functions g in G such that g (x 1 ) = g (x 2 ).

Reference-contexts: Unconditional security was therefore considered too expensive for a long time. However, recent developments show how Shannon's model can be modified <ref> [16] </ref> to make practical provably secure cryptosystems possible. The first modification is to relax the requirement that perfect security means complete independence between the plaintext and the adversary's knowledge and to allow an arbitrarily small correlation. <p> Third, the system offers `proactive' security in the sense that a future increase in storage capacity cannot break the secrecy of messages encrypted earlier. A precursor of this system is the Rip van Winkle cipher proposed by Massey and Ingemars-son <ref> [17, 16] </ref>. This private-key system is provably computationally secure but totally impractical because a legitimate receiver must wait even longer for receiving a message than it takes an adversary to decrypt it.

Reference-contexts: This private-key system is provably computationally secure but totally impractical because a legitimate receiver must wait even longer for receiving a message than it takes an adversary to decrypt it. Related to our work is a paper by Maurer <ref> [18] </ref> that describes a system based on a large public randomizer which cannot be read entirely within feasible time. Maurer's paper contains also the idea of realizing provably secure encryption based only on assumptions about an enemy's available memory. <p> Such a system for key agreement was described by Mitchell [20], but without security proof. Our analysis provides the first proof that unconditional security can be achieved against memory-bounded adversaries. (Recently, Aumann and Rabin [22] proved a conjecture of Maurer's paper <ref> [18] </ref> with the same effect.) We borrow some methods from the work of Zuckerman and others on so-called extractors of uniform randomness from weak random sources [29]. Extractors are tools developed for running randomized algorithms with non-perfect randomness instead of uniform random bits.

Reference-contexts: Current implementations of quantum key distribution span distances of 20-30 kilometers. Noisy Channel: In this model proposed by Maurer, the output of a random source is transmitted to the participants over partially independent noisy channels that insert errors with certain probabilities <ref> [19] </ref>. Two parties can then generate a secret key from their received values by public discussion. The secrecy of the key is based on the information differences between the channel outputs and on the assumption that no channel is completely error-free.

Nisan <ref> [21] </ref> presents a highly readable introduction to extractors and a survey of their applications. The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing some information-theoretic concepts in Section 2, we introduce the building blocks of our system in Section 3. <p> This is indeed the case, as was observed before by Zuckerman and others in the context of weak random sources <ref> [29, 21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Renyi entropy of order ff of a random variable X with alphabet X is H ff (X) = 1 ff X P X (x) ff for ff 0 and ff 6= 1 <ref> [23] </ref>. Because the limiting case of Renyi entropy for ff ! 1 is Shannon entropy, we can extend the definition to H 1 (X) = H (X).

Reference-contexts: Security proofs for these systems show that the ability of the adversary to defeat the cryptosystem with significant probability contradicts the assumed difficulty of the problem <ref> [24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The following considerations demonstrate that this system is on the verge of being practical. The broadcast channel could be realized by a satellite. Typically, current communications satellites have a capacity of 1-10 Gbit/s <ref> [25] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An alternative to proofs in the computational security model is offered by the stronger notion of information-theoretic or unconditional security where no limits on an adversary's computational power are assumed. The first information-theoretic definition of perfect secrecy by Shannon <ref> [26] </ref> led immediately to his famous impracticality theorem, which states, roughly, that the shared secret key in any perfectly secure cryptosystem must be at least as long as the plaintext to be encrypted.
