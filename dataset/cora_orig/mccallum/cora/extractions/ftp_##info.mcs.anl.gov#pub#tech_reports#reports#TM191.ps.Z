Reference-contexts: According to Andre Weil, "Perhaps the most important contribution of Bourbaki was to carry out a famous proposal made by the great German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900 that mathematics be placed on a more secure foundation." He noted: "Hilbert just said so, and Bourbaki did it" <ref> [1] </ref>. Yet several participants believe that Bourbaki is what QED should not be, in particular because Bourbaki is highly praised, but rarely used. Wide use by research communities was deemed vital.

Reference-contexts: In particular, professional research mathematicians are only beginning to show interest in using theorem proving to attack hard problems. A recent article in the New York Times illustrates the level of skepticism manifest by many mathematicians about the feasibility of automated theorem provers <ref> [2] </ref>. Compounding the problem is the difficulty of encoding mathematical results and their proofs in a single database that can be easily used by students not only at the graduate level but also at the K-12 level.

Reference-contexts: A principal objective of the QED Workshop, then, was to discuss the feasibility of constructing an "intellectual infrastructure"|an organized framework encapsulating theorem provers and checkers, proofs, and the basic ideas of mathematics. The groundwork for discussion at the QED Workshop was a document known as the QED Manifesto <ref> [3] </ref>. Many of the participants had contributed to this document, directly or indirectly, by comments via electronic mail. Moreover, several of the participants are already working on mathematics-related projects in theorem proving. One notable example is the Mizar system [4], which has a substantial body of formally checked mathematics.
