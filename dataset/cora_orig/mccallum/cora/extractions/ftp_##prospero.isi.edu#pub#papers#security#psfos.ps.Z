Reference-contexts: The effect of such an attack can be reduced with the introduction of smartcards capable of performing the encryption necessary to take part in the authentication protocol without divulging the client's key to the workstation <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative is the use of one-time smartcard-generated passwords in conjunction with the authentication protocol. Work is underway to add such functionality to Kerberos.

Reference-contexts: By basing such signatures on public key cryptography [3], the signatures can be verified by multiple users. Among the authentication systems under development that are based on public-key cryptography are SPX [16] and X.509 <ref> [2] </ref>. While public key cryptography is the appropriate choice for digital signatures, its advantage over conventional cryptography for one-to-one authentication is less clear.

Reference-contexts: Existing encryption-based authentication techniques allow this attack to occur without significant interaction with the authentication server. The attacker repeatedly decrypts text encrypted in the users key, and checks whether it yields the expected result. Lomas et al. <ref> [6] </ref> have shown how an authentication protocol can be designed which does not give the attacker the information needed to verify the correctness of the guess. The second point of vulnerability for existing authentication mechanisms is the computer used by the client.

Reference-contexts: Among the mechanisms that have been proposed for distributed accounting are Amoeba's bank server and restricted proxies. In Amoeba, a client contacts a bank server to transfer funds into the end-server's account before it requests service <ref> [7] </ref>. The end-server then provides service until the pre-paid funds have been exhausted. Restricted proxies [9] support two models for distributed accounting. The first is analogous to a certified check. The client first obtains authorization in the form of a restricted proxy from an accounting server.

Reference-contexts: Such approval can be communicated through a digitally signed certificate that includes a checksum of the reviewed program. The checksum is analogous to a tamper-evident seal allowing the detection of subsequent changes. Such techniques have been considered as a way to limit the spread of viruses <ref> [10] </ref>. The mechanisms described above will require the user to decide which authorities it trusts to provide assurances about the security of the programs and servers it uses. Such assurances could be automatically checked before a program is run, or when a server is contacted.

Reference-contexts: The main cost of basing authentication on public key cryptography is that it requires additional assumptions about the properties of the cryptosystem. These assumptions significantly reduce one's options in choosing the cryptosystem. In fact, at the present time, RSA <ref> [11] </ref> is the only practical choice for a public key cryptosystem. The primary vulnerability of existing authentication techniques is not the certification authority. It is the user's choice of passwords.
