Abstract: A novel approach to utility assessment is presented which enables the elicitation of an individualized understanding of the patients perspective. The result illuminates what dimensions of health are regarded as important in the patients own terms. This approach is in contrast to traditional utility assessment, which is conducted in prescribed terms, is difficult to apply with confidence on an individual basis and solicits a nonreusable single value for a specific outcome of a decision context. This paper discusses a method which attempts to elicit a complete, comprehensive and operational system of attribute scales to describe the relevant attributes of health in an individuals personal perspective. The result is a personalized model that can be used to score any health in those terms with reusable components. Piloting investigations with this fundamental approach reveal potential as a foundation for simple or complex multiattribute modeling and as promising with respect to psychometric evaluation. The systematic approach is grounds for expectation of automation and consistency which could raise the level of applied decision analysis in medical decisions. care policy and resource management from a social and corporate perspective. One glaring absence is the means to represent the individuals perspective if it differs significantly from the empirical norm of studied or consulted populations. Traditionally, health status measures have reflected the value system of the biomedical community (e.g., life span was used long before quality of life adjustments were included). Recent recognition of this biased view of life has given rise to the question of what dimensions should be included in health utility assessment. Most recently this has been addressed through the efforts to elicit the most meaningful parameters from experts and patients gathered in focus groups intending to develop a model for what dimensions to include. However, as a matter of practicality, dimensions rarely shared by more than a few persons are neglected in this approach. This does nothing to accommodate those individuals for which these dimensions serve an unusual importance. It serves the purpose of society but not the individual. Fundamentally, the practice of utility assessment is not incapable of individual application. The commonly recognized methods (rating scale, standard gamble and time tradeoff) have been applied to a lengthy list of medical domains, one patient at a time. In the absence of a satisfying gold standard, ambivalence about the results exists on the part of the health care provider. This and patient violation of prescriptive conclusions have prompted modified methods. Repeatedly in this evolutionary process, the evidence describes diversity among individuals and contexts, which so far eludes a coherent overall explanation outside the assertion that people are often irrational. The complexity of instruments and results underscore the demand for trained experts to conduct utility assessment where it is required. Skill required to maintain quality control on the elicitation process is exceeded by that required for interpretation of the answers given by those interviewed, as well as that required to stay abreast of the growing list of questions raised about the methodology and their ramifications. Not only must the analyst be highly trained, they must also slow down and take time to actively listen to the often inarticulate person from whom the information must be acquired. Rushing it confuses and confounds.

Reference-contexts: The attribute scale for which all levels plausible are known, is then assessed to determined the utility values for each level. Utility assessment techniques of Keeney and Raiffa <ref> (Keeney and Raiffa 1976) </ref> are employed to determine utility values for attribute scales with inherent cardinality. The ordered attribute scales left have two or more discrete levels.

Reference-contexts: The linear model used to compute composite scores for health states in this multiattributed representation is not the only possibility. Varied appealing alternative models which are more complex are discussed in the literature of utility assessment and decision theory <ref> (Wellman 1985) </ref>. The approach put forth here is simply intended as a baseline from which more complex models might be pursued with presumably more complex elicitation protocols.

The systematic nature of this novel approach would suggest similar codification for each of the component parts is feasible and their integration into a coherent application equally so. Efforts to implement this individualized utility assessment with a single computer program are underway.
