Reference-contexts: Analyses of the N-person cooperative game circumvent the difficulties associated with strategic interaction in a different way by introducing detailed decision rules concerning such things as the relative power of the players (e.g., the Shapley value and the Nash solution). Some game theorists (e.g., <ref> (Harsanyi & Selten 1972) </ref>) have sought to achieve determinate solutions for nonzero-sum games by introducing the notion that each player may be able to assign subjective probabilities to the choices of the other participant.

Reference-contexts: Although there has been interesting progress reported in the literature (e.g., <ref> (Jordan 1992) </ref>), the fundamental framework and methodology of game theory remains almost the same and it might be too early to tell whether these new results will reshape the current game theoretic framework. whatever strategy he himself selects.

Reference-contexts: Multi-agent resource allocation as a special case of negotiation has been extensively explored by <ref> (Kraus & Subrahmanian 1995) </ref>, in which logic framework and time constraints are taken into consideration within the traditional framework of game theory. Some recent work (e.g., (Sen & Sekaran 1995; Sandolm & Lesser 1995)) in the context of Distributed AI addresses multiagent learning issues in various settings.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in developing autonomous agents capable of reasoning based on experience and improving their negotiation behavior incrementally. Learning in negotiation is closely coupled with the issue of how to model the overall negotiation process, i.e., what negotiation protocols are adopted. Standard game-theoretic models <ref> (Osborne & Rubinstein 1994) </ref> tend to focus on outcomes of negotiation in contrast to the negotiation process itself. DAI research (Rosen-schein & Zlotkin 1994) emphasizes special protocols articulating compromises while trying to minimize the potential interactions or communications of the involved agents.

Reference-contexts: To address the computational complexity issues with Bayesian analysis, we use the Bayesian belief network representation and updating mechanism. In addition to providing efficient updating techniques, Bayesian belief networks offer an expressive modeling language and allow easy and flexible encoding of domain-specific knowledge <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>. In this section, we revisit the buyer-supplier example used before to demonstrate how the Bayesian framework can be utilized in a negotiation setting.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce <ref> (Sandolm & Lesser 1995) </ref> has given increased importance to automated negotiation. Much DAI and game theoretic research (Rosen-schein & Zlotkin 1994; Osborne & Rubinstein 1994) deals with coordination and negotiation issues by giving pre-computed solutions to specific problems.

Reference-contexts: AI models and programs help the players locate an approximate solution strategy according to bounded rationality principles by utilizing heuristic search, heuristic evaluation, and learning techniques. Along with the emergence and development of DAI techniques, there has been increasing interest in using AI methodology and frameworks in negotiation modeling. <ref> (Sycara 1990) </ref> enriched the negotiation model by integrating AI planning, Case-Based Reasoning and other decision theoretic techniques.

Reference-contexts: In making his decision, the rational individual must take into account the probable choices of others, whose choices are in turn contingent upon his own. This leads to the well known outguessing regress <ref> (Young 1975) </ref> where no accurate prediction or confident expectation about the individual choices can be produced. Therefore, the central theme of all negotiation models is avoiding this dilemma involved in strategic interaction.
