Abstract: New services have been defined to allow the Internet to address the demands of new multimedia applications. Meeting the Quality of Service requirements for these services involves implementing new features on routers and bandwidth management is a key aspect of this effort. In this paper we compare the use of ABR versus CBR service to provide bandwidth and real time commitments to the multimedia traffic on Internet backbones over ATM. We discuss effective throughput and delay trade-offs for a traffic mix using Best Effort (BE) and non-BE services. We also extend the Class Based Queueing features to trigger bandwidth re-negotiations.

Reference-contexts: Part of the differences among these approaches result from the way the Internet traffic is actually transported: through the use of VCs to interconnect ATM attached devices (hosts or routers) (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), through the use of a backbone of interconnected routers (where ATM is used as a leased line replacement), or through a combination of both (e.g., [2]).

The suitability of one solution over another depends on the network scenario considered (LAN, MAN or WAN) and on the type of Internet service (Best Effort (BE) service, Guaranteed Service (GS) [3], or Controlled Load (CL) service [4]) used for transporting the different classes of traffic.

The delay variance illustrated here for the ABR backbones could be easily compensated for through appropriate buffering at the destinations.

In this paper we study the efficient utilization of ATM resources for the transport of such multimedia Internet traffic and for the delivery of delay guarantees to the traffic using the GS and CL services. <p> However, because the ABR flow control recovers the bandwidth unused along the VP path, the BE portion of the VP traffic can transmit at rates higher than what it is allocated. Hence, unlike the CBQ approach in <ref> [9] </ref>, we allow the link (VP) class to be overlimit.

Reference-contexts: This is the scenario we consider is our simulation studies. In an ABR backbone scenario, the routers close the ABR flow control feedback loop, i.e., they function as Virtual Sources (VS) and Virtual Destinations (VD) for the VP traffic. In <ref> [10] </ref> we defined simple VS/VD behaviors for a tandem topology such as the one in Figure 3 that implements a back-pressure to tune the sources' offered load to the bandwidth available on the backbone link.

Reference-contexts: The use of VSs/VDs improves the performance of the ABR flow control to some extent, but in the presence of relatively bursty VBR traffic, the ABR traffic cannot perfectly recover the bandwidth leftover. In <ref> [11] </ref> we discuss bandwidth over-booking as a means to keep a persistent ABR backlog on the bottleneck switch to improve network utilization. 4 Simulation Results In this section we report on simulation results obtained using the model depicted on Figure 3 for the joint transport of TCP/IP data traffic and RT <p> All link speeds are 150Mbps, the links are 800km (~ 4ms) long and the routers are placed at switch sites.

Our aggregate VBR traffic is generated by an MMDP model emulating the traffic of 10 VBR sources transmitting at a peak rate of 10Mbps.

Reference-contexts: Both classes of traffic are sent over AAL5. For the data traffic we consider large file transfers through ftp, where the TCP maximum segment size is 1024 bytes. For the video traffic we consider real-time H.261 video streams <ref> [12] </ref> transmitted at a target rate of 1.5Mbps, with 15 consecutive H.261 frames (960 bytes) sent on every IP packet. All link speeds are 150Mbps, the links are 800km (~ 4ms) long and the routers are placed at switch sites.

Reference-contexts: Our aggregate VBR traffic is generated by an MMDP model emulating the traffic of 10 VBR sources transmitting at a peak rate of 10Mbps. We consider sources having a very small burstiness (b=1.4) and, for simplicity, they are carried over CBR connections <ref> [14] </ref>. Hence, the VBR traffic is assigned 110Mbps, leaving 40Mbps for the Internet traffic. We compare the results for a CBR versus an ABR backbone where this 40Mbps corresponds to the peak-rate and the MCR (in bit rate) allocation, respectively.

Reference-contexts: If the sessions are short-lived and if we continuously have thousand of such sessions, the performance perceived by the BE traffic is compromised since some 50% of the TCP traffic can be dropped <ref> [15] </ref>. As for the GS and CL Internet services, they are not currently concerned with delay jitter [3, 4]. Hence, the ability of the CBR service to meet hard bounds on this particular performance metric, as illustrated above, represents an over commitment by the ATM network.

Reference-contexts: The intended applications for this service are delay and throughput adaptive RT applications such as the tool in <ref> [16] </ref>. The GS service, on the other hand, is intended to guarantee firm bounds on delay and supporting it over our ABR backbone may not seem appropriate. However, in our scenario, the routers consider the allocated MCR for the purposes of admission control and link sharing enforcement.

Reference-contexts: Namely, we need a differentiated ABR service. This need has already been recognized for the portion of the ABR traffic represented by the RM-cell flows <ref> [17] </ref>. Since, the router knows the different types of traffic and the portion of bandwidth assigned to them, it can indicate the relative priority of the different cell streams through the use of the Cell Loss Priority (CLS) bit in ATM cells.
