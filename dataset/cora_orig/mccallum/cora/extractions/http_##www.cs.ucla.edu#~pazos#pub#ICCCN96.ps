Abstract: Connectionless traffic originating from LANs is carried as Available Bit Rate (ABR) traffic in the ATM network and is subjected to ATM level flow control, either rate-based or credit-based. In addition, transport layer flow control (e.g. TCP window control) is applied at the end points. In this paper, we study the interaction between TCP and ATM flow controls. We use simulation to compare the "goodput" of different ABR flow control schemes and to evaluate the sensitivity to different parameter selections (e.g., TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS), round trip delay, etc). The study uncovers an unfairness situation caused by the use of non uniform MSS values.

Reference-contexts: Hence, in this paper we investigate the interaction between the TCP flow control and various ABR controls implemented at the ATM layer, namely, FCVC, PRCA, EPRCA and SP-EPRCA. A more extended discussion of the results presented here can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 ABR Flow Control Schemes Since no UPC (User Parameter Control) can be applied to ABR traffic, flow control has to be implemented through feedback from the network congestion points to the traffic sources, allowing the ABR traffic to use the bandwidth left over by CBR and VBR traffic.

Reference-contexts: In one of them, buffers are reserved at intermediate nodes along a VC and credit information is exchanged between consecutive fl Bolsista do CNPq Braslia/Brasil intermediate nodes, from the destination all the way back to the source. One such scheme is the FCVC <ref> [2] </ref>. In the other approach, the source transmission rate is controlled based on congestion feedback information from the network. Examples of rate-based solutions are PRCA, EPRCA [3] and SP-EPRCA [4]. 3 The Simulation Model We have developed a simulation model to evaluate the system shown in Figure 1. <p> Furthermore, for the FCVC scheme, the ABR queue is subdivided into different VC queues. The buffer allocation for each queue is derived as per <ref> [2] </ref>. For the short links the VC buffer accommodates 11 cells, while in the longer links (as in the cross-country case), the buffers can hold 81 cells. This is also the buffer allocation used for the SP scheme.

Reference-contexts: Namely, we assume a cross-country distance separat-ing the sources from the destination. We have the same configuration of seven switches interconnected by 600Km links. Our TCP implementation is based on the TCP description found in <ref> [5] </ref> with the slow-start feature. The VBR generator uses an MMDP model that describes the aggregated traffic of multiple VBR sources. The VBR traffic uses most of the bandwidth, leaving just a little unused bandwidth to be shared among the ABR (TCP) sources.

Reference-contexts: This is because FCVC employs back-pressure and buffer reservations which prevent cell losses that would trigger TCP retransmissions. Furthermore, the goodput experienced with FCVC is very close to the theoretical bound discussed in <ref> [6] </ref>. For the PRCA scheme we used a Multiplicative Decrease Factor (M DF ) value of 5.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the cost effectiveness of very robust and complex schemes can very poor. The ATM Forum has already ruled that rate-based control should be used for ABR traffic flow control <ref> [7] </ref>. However there is still plenty of room for improvement. Suggesting that the switches should only provide cell marking for congestion indication, allows switch manufacturers not to implement the explicit rate computation for all VCs traversing the switches.
