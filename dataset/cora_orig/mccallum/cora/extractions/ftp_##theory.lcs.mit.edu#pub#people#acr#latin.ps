Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following question: what is the maximum number of entries that can be added to a partially filled latin square? The decision version of this question is known to be NP-complete. We present two approximation algorithms for the optimization version of this question. We first prove that the greedy algorithm achieves a factor of 1/3. We then use insights derived from the linear relaxation of an integer program to obtain an algorithm based on matchings that achieves a better performance guarantee of 1/2. These are the first known polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the latin square completion problem that achieve non-trivial worst-case performance guarantees. Our motivation derives from applications to the problems of lightpath assignment and switch configuration in wavelength routed multihop optical networks.

Reference-contexts: WDM optical networks utilize the large bandwidth available in optical fibers by partitioning it into several channels each at a different optical wavelength <ref> [1, 4, 14, 15] </ref>. The typical optical network consists of routing nodes interconnected by point-to-point fiber-optic links. Each link supports a certain number of wavelengths. The routing nodes are capable of photonic switching, also known as dynamic wavelength routing which involves the setting up of lightpaths [3, 5, 21].

Conflict-free wavelength routing in wide-area optical networks is achieved by utilizing latin routers <ref> [2] </ref>. These are routing devices that employ the concept of a latin square (LS). <p> The computational aspect of completing PLSs was initiated by Rosa [18] and Giles, Oyama and Trotter [10].

The question of approximating the PLSE problem was considered at great length by Chen and Banerjee in [3]. They provide an algorithm and a heuristic for approximating the PLSE problem.

The algorithm, however, takes exponential time in the worst case.

Reference-contexts: The PLSE problem as stated above is an optimization problem. The natural decision version of the problem namely, given a PLS establish whether it is completable has been shown to be NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. We present the first known polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the PLSE problem with nontrivial worst-case performance guarantees. 2 1.2 Other Applications This study also has applications to the more classical areas of statistical designs and error-correcting codes (which were in fact the original drivers of the research into LSs). <p> An excellent survey of the ongoing attempt to characterize completable PLSs appears in [16]. The computational aspect of completing PLSs was initiated by Rosa [18] and Giles, Oyama and Trotter [10]. The issue was finally resolved by Colbourn <ref> [6] </ref> who proved that the problem of deciding whether a PLS is completable is NP-complete. Barry and Humblet [2] were the first to recognize the applicability of LSs to the problem of wavelength assignment in optical networks. <p> The problem of P LS extension can 3 now be viewed equivalently as the problem of coloring additional vertices given the corresponding partially colored graph. This motivates our use of the terminology color for the entries of a PLS. 3.2 Extending and Completing PLSs some Combinatorial Lemmas Colbourn's result, <ref> [6] </ref>, showing that PLS-completability is NP-complete has effectively put paid to our hopes of discovering a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing completable PLSs. But it remains an intriguing problem to understand what can be salvaged.
