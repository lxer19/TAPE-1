Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) systems allow the user to interact with objects which arent really there. New experiences and new capabilities are made possible by creating a virtual environment in which the user manipulates objects, builds worlds and communicates with other virtual users. This paper considers the popular image of VR with head-mounted displays and instrumented gloves and then takes a broader view in order to highlight some aspects of VRs evolution which might otherwise be overlooked. Four example applications are examined and these provide further pointers for designers of all kinds of virtual reality system.

Reference-contexts: For example, a project at the University of North Carolina, USA <ref> (Bajura, 1992) </ref> uses a head-mounted display to present an ultrasound image superimposed onto a video cameras view of a real patient, allowing the user to effectively see inside the patient in real time, similar to the head-up displays used by pilots of military aircraft.
