Abstract: Scope and Purpose|Airline crew scheduling is a very visible and economically significant problem. Because of its widespread use, economic significance, and difficulty of solution, the problem has attracted the attention of the operations research community for over twenty-five years. The purpose of this paper was to develop a genetic algorithm for the airline crew scheduling problem, and to compare it with traditional approaches. Abstract|This paper discusses the development and application of a hybrid genetic algorithm to airline crew scheduling problems. The hybrid algorithm consists of a steady-state genetic algorithm and a local search heuristic. The hybrid algorithm was tested on a set of forty real-world problems. It found the optimal solution for half the problems, and good solutions for nine others. The results were compared to those obtained with branch-and-cut and branch-and-bound algorithms. The branch-and-cut algorithm was significantly more successful than the hybrid algorithm, and the branch-and-bound algorithm slightly better.

Reference-contexts: Associated with each assignment of a crew to a particular flight leg is a cost, c j . The matrix elements a ij are defined by a ij = 1 if flight leg i is on rotation j 0 otherwise. (4) Airline crew scheduling is an economically significant problem <ref> [1, 3, 11, 16] </ref> and often a difficult one to solve. One approximate approach (as well as the starting point for most exact approaches) is to solve the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the SPP. <p> However, in recent years it has been noted that as SPP problems grow in size, fractional solutions occur more frequently, and simply rounding or performing a "small" branch-and-bound tree search may not be effective <ref> [1, 3, 11] </ref>. Exact approaches are usually based on branch-and-bound, with bounding strategies such as linear programming and Lagrangian relaxation. Fischer and Kedia [10] used continuous analogs of the greedy and 3 opt methods to provide improved lower bounds. <p> In our implementation of mutation we complement a bit with probability 1=n. In our algorithm we apply crossover or mutation. To do this we select two parent strings, and generate a random number r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. If r is less than the crossover probability, p c = 0:6, we create two new offspring via two-point crossover and randomly select one of them to insert in the new population.

Reference-contexts: More traditional methods may have trouble accommodating the addition of new constraints as easily. Third, at any iteration, genetic algorithms contain a population of possible solutions. As noted by Arabeyre et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, "The knowledge of a family of good solutions is far more important than obtaining an isolated optimum." Fourth, the NP-completeness of finding feasible solutions in the general case [23] and the enormous size of problems of current industrial interest make the SPP a good problem on which to test the
