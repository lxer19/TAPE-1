Abstract: We provide a set of "natural" requirements for well-orderings of (binary) list structures. We show that the resultant order-type is the successor of the first critical epsilon number. The checker has to verify that the process comes to an end. Here again he should be assisted by the programmer giving a further definite assertion to be verified. This may take the form of a quantity which is asserted to decrease continually and vanish when the machine stops. To the pure mathematician it is natural to give an ordinal number. In this problem the ordinal might be (n r)! 2 + (r s)! + k. A less highbrow form of the same thing would be to give the integer 2 80 (n r) + 2 40 (r s) + k.

Reference-contexts: By imposing a lexicographic rule, we get|not surprisingly|an * 0 ordering. Then, in 2 Section 3, we present our main results, the extension of the natural order-ing to arbitrary list structures, which correspond to the "rational" subset <ref> [ Courcelle, 1983 ] </ref> of infinite binary trees. We show that * * * + 1 can be proved well-ordered by the Homeomorphic Embedding Theorem on infinite binary trees.

Reference-contexts: We consider infinite binary trees, and show how a "regular" subclass|the trees representable as list structures in Lisp|more than suffice for all ordinals up to and including * * * , the first critical epsilon number. (Different notions of "naturalness" of ordinal notations are surveyed in <ref> [ Crossley and Kister, 1986/1987 ] </ref> .) Conversely, ordinals up to and including * * * can be neatly represented by this subclass of infinite binary trees. In the next section, we consider natural orderings on binary trees, and some (known) consequences of those principles for finite trees.

Reference-contexts: In other words, our ordering is well-founded. We have already seen that is order-isomorphic to * 0 .

Reference-contexts: Since such expressions give all ordinals below * 0 , our ordering is of order-type * 0 , too. Thus, expressions in Cantor Normal Form are in one-to-one correspondence with the equivalence classes on binary trees imposed by '. 2.3 Embedding Theorem As a special case of Higman's Lemma <ref> [ Higman, 1952 ] </ref> , we know that, in any infinite sequence ft i g i&lt;! of finite binary trees, there must be two trees t j and t k (j &lt; k) such that t j is homeomorphically embedded in t k .
