Title: Hierarchical Packet Fair Queueing Algorithms  
Author: Jon C.R. Bennett Hui Zhang 
Affiliation: FORE Systems  Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: Hierarchical Packet Fair Queueing (H-PFQ) algorithms have the potential to simultaneously support guaranteed real-time service, rate-adaptive best-effort, and controlled link-sharing service. In this paper, we design practical H-PFQ algorithms by using one-level Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) servers as basic building blocks, and develop techniques to analyze delay and fairness properties of the resulted H-PFQ servers. We demonstrate that, in order to provide tight delay bounds in a H-PFQ server, it is essential for the one-level PFQ servers to have small Worst-case Fair Indices (WFI). We propose a new one-level PFQ algorithm called WF 2 Q+ that is the first to have all the following three properties: (a) providing the tightest delay bound among all PFQ algorithms; (b) having the smallest WFI among all PFQ algorithms; and (c) having a relatively low implementation complexity of O(log N). We show that practical H-PFQ algorithms can be implemented by using WF 2 Q+ as the basic building block and prove that the resulting H-WF 2 Q+ algorithms provide similar delay bounds and bandwidth distribution as those provided by a H-GPS server. Simulation experiments are presented to evaluate the proposed algorithm.

Reference-contexts: There are several noteworthy properties of V W F 2 Q+ (). First, it is a strictly monotonically increasing function of time with a minimum slope of 1. We call this the "minimum slope property" of V W F 2 Q+ . As discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, having a virtual time function with the minimum slope property is a necessary and sufficient condition for a PFQ server to provide delay bounds to leaky bucket constrained sources that are within one packet transmission time of those provided by GPS. <p> There are two major tasks associated with implementing WF 2 Q+ : (a) computation of the virtual time function; and (b) maintaining the set of eligible sessions sorted by virtual finish times. As shown in <ref> [1] </ref>, both can be accomplished with O (log N) complexity. The following theorem is proven in [1] Theorem 4 (1) W F 2 Q+ is work-conserving. (2) W F 2 Q+ is worst-case fair for session i with ff i;W F 2 Q+ = L i;max + (L max L i;max <p> As shown in <ref> [1] </ref>, both can be accomplished with O (log N) complexity.

Reference-contexts: In addition, as we will demonstrate, to achieve tight delay bounds in the H-GPS server, one-level PFQ servers also need to have (c) a small Worst-case Fair Index (WFI) as defined in <ref> [2] </ref>. Most of the previously proposed PFQ algorithms including the popular Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) [6, 14] and Self-Clocked Fair Queueing (SCFQ) [9] do not have small WFI's. In fact, they both have WFI's that grow proportionally to the number of queues in the system. <p> The only exception is Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing or WF 2 Q, which is proven to have the smallest WFI among all PFQ algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>. However, WF 2 Q uses a virtual time function with a high complexity. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that maintains all the important properties of WF 2 Q, but has a lower complexity than WF 2 Q. We call the new algorithm WF 2 Q+ . <p> the link bandwidth, its packet may be delayed by 120 ms in just one hop! In contrast, if GPS or H-GPS is used, the worst-case delay for a packet arriving at an empty A1 real-time queue is 0.4 ms. 3.2 WFI and Its Effect on Delay Bounds of H-PFQ In <ref> [2] </ref>, we introduce a metric called Worst-case Fair Index (WFI) to characterize PFQ servers. In this session, we will show that having PFQ servers with small WFIs is a prerequisite to constructing a H-PFQ server that provides tight delay bounds. <p> That is, with GPS or H-GPS, a packet coming an empty session queue can receive its guaranteed service rate immediately after its arrival. However, as illustrated in the example in Fig. 2, the T-WFI for WFQ can be quite large. In fact, it is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that WFI for WF 2 Q increases linearly as a function of the number of sessions N. Since the previous definition of WFI applies only to a standalone server, we introduce a general definition of WFI that applies also to a server node in a hierarchical system. <p> Most of the previously proposed PFQ algorithms have large WFI's. In <ref> [2] </ref>, we present an algorithm called Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing (WF 2 Q). <p> During any interval in the example, the dif ference between the amounts of bits transmitted by GPS and WF 2 Q is less than one packet size. Therefore, WF 2 Q is a more accurate approximation of GPS than WFQ. The following theorem is proven in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Before we proceed to establish the relationship between the delay bound of a H-PFQ server and WFI's of PFQ server nodes, we first give the following definition of guaranteed service burstiness index (SBI) as proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. We will show that the guaranteed service burstiness property can be viewed as a generalized bounded delay property that applies not only to a standalone server, but also to a server node in a hierarchical system. <p> For most rate-based service disciplines [20], if the server guarantees a delay bound of D i to a leaky bucket constrained session, it also guarantees a SBI of r i D i i to the session <ref> [4] </ref>. Therefore, bounded service burstiness property and bounded delay property are equivalent for standalone rate-based servers. Since the bounded service burstiness property applies also to server nodes in a hierarchy, it can be used as a generalized bounded delay property.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that with a one-level GPS: (1) an end-to-end delay bound can be provided to a session if the traffic on that session is leaky bucket constrained [14]; (2) bandwidth is fairly distributed to competing sessions <ref> [6] </ref> and (3) the sources can accurately estimate the available bandwidth to them in a distributed fashion [11]. The first property forms the basis for supporting real-time traffic [3] and the third property enables robust and distributed end-to-end traffic management algorithms for best-effort traffic [11, 15]. <p> In addition, as we will demonstrate, to achieve tight delay bounds in the H-GPS server, one-level PFQ servers also need to have (c) a small Worst-case Fair Index (WFI) as defined in [2].

However, when the packet system is ready to choose the next packet to transmit, it is possible that the next packet to depart under the fluid system have not arrived at the packet system. <p> To have a work-conserving packet system, the packet server must choose a packet to transmit based only on the state of the fluid system up to time t . In Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) <ref> [6] </ref>, when the server is ready to transmit the next packet at time t , it picks, among all the packets queued in the system at t , the first packet that would complete service in the corresponding GPS system if no additional packets were to arrive after time t . <p> With this property, it is possible to maintain the relative GPS finish order for packets in the WFQ system by using a priority queue mechanism. An implementation based on the notion of a virtual time function is proposed in <ref> [6, 14] </ref>. <p> We propose a new PFQ algorithm called WF 2 Q that not only provides tight delay bound and low WFI, but also has a relatively low complexity.

In addition, they will need to support link-sharing <ref> [8] </ref>, which allows resource sharing among applications that require different network services but belong to the same administrative class. In packet-switched networks, packets from different sessions belonging to different service classes and administrative classes interact with each other when they are multiplexed at the same output link of a switch. <p> Adjusting the weight according to the set of backlogged sessions in the packet system can result in large errors. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Floyd and Jacobson present an architecture which during congestion first gives priority to link sharing, and once the link sharing goals are met, a general scheduler provides for the various service guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Since H-GPS is defined in a hypothetical fluid system, packet algorithms that approximate H-GPS need to be designed. A number of one-level Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms have been proposed to approximate the one-level GPS algorithm <ref> [9, 14] </ref>. To reduce the implementation complexity, they all use the notion of a virtual time function that tracks the progress in the fluid system. As we will show in Section 2, the same technique based on a single virtual time function does not apply to H-GPS. <p> Most of the previously proposed PFQ algorithms including the popular Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) [6, 14] and Self-Clocked Fair Queueing (SCFQ) <ref> [9] </ref> do not have small WFI's. In fact, they both have WFI's that grow proportionally to the number of queues in the system. As a result, the delay bounds provided by H-PFQ servers that are made of WFQ or SCFQ are much larger than those provided by H-GPS. <p> Besides maintaining a priority queue, there is also the cost of maintaining the virtual time function V GP S (:) with this implementation. While the average complexity of computing V GP S (:) is O (1), the worst complexity can be O (N) <ref> [9] </ref>. It is possible to have other Packet Fair Queueing algorithms based on virtual time functions with lower worst-case com plexity. For example, in [9], Golestani proposed a virtual time function V SCF Q with a worst-case complexity of O (1). <p> While the average complexity of computing V GP S (:) is O (1), the worst complexity can be O (N) <ref> [9] </ref>. It is possible to have other Packet Fair Queueing algorithms based on virtual time functions with lower worst-case com plexity. For example, in [9], Golestani proposed a virtual time function V SCF Q with a worst-case complexity of O (1). Later in this paper, we will propose a more accurate virtual time function with a worst-case complexity of O (log N). <p> While a number of new virtual time functions have been proposed to simplify the implementation of WFQ <ref> [9, 18] </ref>, they all result in PFQ algorithms with large WFI's. <p> Therefore, both WFQ and WF 2 Q can provide tight delay bounds. On the other hand, the virtual time function used by SCFQ <ref> [9] </ref> may have a slope of 0 during certain periods, and therefore the delay bounds provided by the resulting SCFQ algorithm are much larger than those provided by WFQ and WF 2 Q [10]. <p> The Class Based Queueing (CBQ) algorithm used to realize the link-sharing architecture, however, is rather ad hoc.

The second important property of V W F 2 Q+ (), as provided by the max over min operation in (27), is that it is at least as large as the minimum virtual start time of all packets at the head of all queues.
