For a general review of the distance geometry problem and its relationship to macromolecular conformation, see Crippen and Havel <ref> [4] </ref>, Havel [10], Kuntz, Thomason, and Oshiro [17], and Brunger and Nilges [1]. A distance geometry problem is specified by a subset S of all atom pairs and by the distances ffi i;j between atoms i and j for (i; j) 2 S. <p> Even stronger results have been obtained showing that k-dimensional distance geometry problems are strongly NP-hard for all k 1. For detailed proofs of these results, see Saxe [22] and Crippen and Havel <ref> [4] </ref>. One of the purposes of this paper is to study the complexity of solving the bounded distance geometry problem (1.2). The distance geometry problem, exact or bounded, can be formulated as a global optimization problem. <p> The objective function for the distance geometry problem is defined so that the constraints are satisfied at a global minimizer of the problem. Special optimization techniques for this class of problems have been developed by Crippen and Havel <ref> [4] </ref>, Havel [10], Hendrickson [11, 12], Glunt, Hayden, and Raydan [8, 9], and More and Wu This work was supported by the Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences Division subprogram of the Office of Computational and Technology Research, U.S. <p> 0 + max 2 kxk 2 u 2 u 2 ; 0 : (1:5) Clearly, x = fx 1 ; : : : ; x m g solves problem (1.2) if and only if x is a global minimizer of f and f (x) = 0 (see Crippen and Havel <ref> [4] </ref>). In the continuation approach to global optimization an integral transformation is used to smooth the original function into a function with fewer minimizers. An optimization algorithm is then used to trace the minimizers of the transformed functions back to the original function.

Reference-contexts: The distance geometry problem (1.1) is computationally intractable in general because the restriction of the distance geometry problem to a one-dimensional space is equivalent to the set partition problem, which is known to be NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. Even stronger results have been obtained showing that k-dimensional distance geometry problems are strongly NP-hard for all k 1. For detailed proofs of these results, see Saxe [22] and Crippen and Havel [4]. <p> positive integers a i 2 Z + , the standard set partition problem is to find a partition S 1 , S 2 of f1; : : :; ng such that X a i = i2S 2 This problem is one of the basic NP-hard problems (see Garey and Johnson <ref> [6] </ref>). We now generalize this problem by allowing approximate solutions.

Reference-contexts: The weights w i and nodes s i in the Gauss-Hermite transform are independent of f and can be found in the literature (for example, Stroud and Secrest [27]) or can be computed with the gauss subroutine in ORTHOPOL (Gautschi <ref> [7] </ref>). The computation of the Gauss-Hermite transform requires m function evaluations. We are interested in the use of Gaussian quadratures to approximate integrals of the form (3.6) where the function H : IR 7! IR is given by (3.4).

On the other hand, the multistart method failed to find a solution in all cases. We also tested GMIN with a 63-atom protein fragment. For this problem, 236 pairwise distances are specified. Hendrickson <ref> [11] </ref> showed that the molecule with this set of distance data is nearly rigid and difficult to determine. Our numerical results confirm this finding. We ran GMIN from 100 starting points for " = 0:01; 0:02; 0:04; 0:06; 0:08; 0:1.
