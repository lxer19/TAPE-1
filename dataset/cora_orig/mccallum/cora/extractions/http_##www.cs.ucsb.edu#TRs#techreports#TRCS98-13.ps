Abstract: Fully-populated torus-connected networks, where every node has a processor attached, do not scale well since load on edges increases superlinearly with network size under heavy communication, resulting in a degradation in network throughput. In a partially-populated network, processors occupy a subset of available nodes, and a routing algorithm is specified among the processors placed. Analogous to multistage networks, it is desirable to have the total number of messages being routed through a particular edge increase at most linearly with the size of the placement on torus networks. Recently, Blaum, Bruck, Pifarre, and Sanz investigated placements and provided both a lower bound, and optimal placements in the cases of 2 and 3-dimensional k-tori, consisting of k and k 2 processors, respectively. In this paper we show formally that to achieve linear load in a d-dimensional k-torus, the number of processors in the placement must be O(k d1 ). We use this to construct a tighter lower bound for the maximum load of a placement for 4 or more dimensions. Based on these results, we give optimal placements and their corresponding routing algorithms in tori with arbitrary number of dimensions.

Reference-contexts: An optimal placement is a placement that achieves linear load on edges using maximum number of processors possible. The notion of resource placement in general has been investigated by a number of researchers such as Bose et al. [5], Alverson et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, F. Pitteli and D. Smitley [11]. Our aim is to give placements and routing algorithms which will enable efficient communication between processors, and at the same time reduce the susceptibility of the network to link faults by reducing the number of messages relying upon a particular edge [3].

Reference-contexts: The network should be able to handle "large" number of messages without exhibiting degradation in performance. Throughput, the maximum amount of traffic which can be handled by the network, is an important measure of network performance <ref> [3] </ref>. The throughput of an interconnection network is in turn bounded by its bisection width, the minimum number of edges that must be removed in order to split the network into two parts each with about equal number of processors [8]. <p> The throughput of an interconnection network is in turn bounded by its bisection width, the minimum number of edges that must be removed in order to split the network into two parts each with about equal number of processors [8]. Here, following Blaum, Bruck, Pifarre, and Sanz <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, we consider the behavior of torus networks with bidirectional links under heavy communication load. We assume that the communication latency is kept minimum by routing the messages through only shortest (minimal length) paths. <p> This means that unlike multistage networks, the maximum load on a link is not linear in the number of processors injecting messages into the network. To alleviate this problem, Blaum et al. <ref> [3, 4] </ref> have proposed partially-populated tori . In this model, the underlying network is torodial, but the nodes do not all inject messages into the network. <p> This is similar to the case of a 2 multistage network: A multistage network with k fi k switches (routing nodes) and log k n stages serves n injection points, and utilizes n log k n routing nodes <ref> [3] </ref>. In partially-populated tori, a routing algorithm which utilizes shortest paths is specified together with the placement. An optimal placement is a placement that achieves linear load on edges using maximum number of processors possible. <p> Pitteli and D. Smitley [11]. Our aim is to give placements and routing algorithms which will enable efficient communication between processors, and at the same time reduce the susceptibility of the network to link faults by reducing the number of messages relying upon a particular edge <ref> [3] </ref>. This is achieved by providing routing algorithms in which the number of minimal paths specified between pairs of processors in the placement is kept large, without compromising the linearity of load. Let E max denote the maximum load over all the edges for the placement P . <p> The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives necessary definitions and the formal statement of the problem. In section 3, a lower bound on the maximum load on an edge is given, which is also a generalization of the lower bound given by <ref> [3] </ref>. This bound, along with the notion of bisection width with respect to a placement, is used to get an upper bound on the number of processors in an optimal placement. <p> For any link l, we denote the set of paths in C A ~p!~q going through l by C A ~p!l!~q , and use the following definition of load as given in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The problem we are interested in is the construction of placements P and associated routing algorithms in T d k such that under the complete exchange scenario, E max = cjP j, for some constant c. For d = 2; 3, Blaum et al. <ref> [3, 4] </ref> have investigated placements with k d1 processors. Evidently, placements with provably maximum possible number of processors are desirable. <p> The lower bound for maximum load originally given by Blaum et al. <ref> [3] </ref> is jP j 1 (4) The following lemma gives a more general form of (4). <p> Originally, linear placements of this form were used in three dimensional tori by Blaum et al. <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, where they were called shifted diagonal placements. We can also specify placements of size tk d1 where t is a fixed integer less than k. <p> Therefore the number of pairs of processors communicating through l is less than t 2 2 d1 k d1 , which is linear in jP j for any fixed constant t &lt; k. 2 9 Conclusion Following the work of Blaum, Bruck, Pifarre, and Sanz <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, we have considered communication in partially-populated torus networks in terms of placements of processors and associated routing algorithms. We have provided lower bounds for the maximum load under the all-to-all communication scenario, and found bounds on the size of an optimal placement.
