Title: Wit: An Infrastructure for Wireless Palmtop Computing  
Author: Terri Watson 
Address: Seattle, Washington  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Washington  
Abstract: Wit is a system infrastructure that supports wireless connection of palmtop computers to a wired local area network (LAN). The system includes a primitive windowing system, non-preemptive threads, reliable and unreliable connections, and a Tcl interpreter[Ouster94] that allows applications to dynamically extend the palmtop system and user interface by downloading sequences of Tcl code. Together, these services provide an environment for exploring issues in mobile computing for small devices by supporting a wide range of solutions for hiding low bandwidth constraints, and permitting disconnected operation through local execution of application functions.

Reference-contexts: There are many other areas of mobile computing that attempt to satisfy a wide range of user requirements and applications. This section describes some related mobile computing projects that are tailored for somewhat different environments. The ParcTab <ref> [Adams*93] </ref> system developed at Xerox is an example of a fairly specialized handheld system in a highly connected environment. The applications are targeted to tasks appropriate to the size of the output device (a three inch display) and to pen input. <p> The IR driver formats outgoing packets into transceiver send commands and handles status messages from the transceiver. It scans the circular input queue, reconstructing packets from the serial data based on framing and CRC codes. A more complete description of the IRNet transceiver protocol can be found in <ref> [Adams*93] </ref>. 2.3 Palmtop Windowing The window system on the palmtop virtualizes the screen to support multiple active applications and ameliorates the constraints of the small 80x25 character display. The local window system is also needed to adequately support disconnected operation.

Reference-contexts: Information retrieval is one of the key applications for wireless handheld computers. The World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [Berners*94, CERN94] </ref> contains an increasing diversity and number of information sources, from movie reviews and shopping malls to articles on medicine. Information is usually stored hierarchically in hypertext documents. The documents can contain hyperlinks to other documents, which can be automatically retrieved when the user selects the link.

Reference-contexts: The Infopad however, is designed to be a multimedia terminal, including special hardware for video decompression. While using the multimedia user interface, the reliability constraints of the wireless connection can be relaxed since the video and audio data can tolerate some errors. The Coda [Satya*90, Kistler*92] and Little Work <ref> [Huston*94] </ref> projects both provide disconnected (and in Coda's case, weakly connected) operation through modifications to the network filesystem to intelligently cache files on the mobile computer.

Reference-contexts: The mobile systems in these projects are laptops that are largely used as general purpose machines. Mobile IP <ref> [Ioannidis*91, Teraoka*91] </ref> is designed to hide the relocation of an IP connection endpoint from applications. This allows existing applications to be unaffected by the mobility, even if a TCP/IP connection is open.

Reference-contexts: The WitTclEval RPC allows the user to dynamically customize the programming interface to meet new application requirements. 2.6 Tcl The Tcl interpreter is the application programming interface for Wit. Tcl is a Tool Command Language developed at Berkeley. <ref> [Ouster94] </ref> The language has a C-like syntax and can be easily combined with C routines to extend the interpreter command set. In Wit, this is used to export window, connection, thread, and other routines as Tcl procedures. System parameters and error statistics can be read and updated by Tcl programs.

Reference-contexts: W* supports local caching and partial document loading. It also unobtrusively indicates to the user when operations may be slow. One example of this is using different attributes to display a hyperlink to a large non-cached document. W* is presented more completely in <ref> [Watson94] </ref>. 3.1.4 wv wv is a wireless video viewer. It uses a modified version of Xerox PARC's video tool, nv [Frederick94] to monitor a video source, and send video frames to the palmtop at an acceptable rate. <p> The application becomes more tolerent of disconnections from the LAN, although possibly only a subset of operations are supported during the disconnection. 11 Design strategies for structuring wireless applications, using W* as an example, are presented in more detail in <ref> [Watson94] </ref>. 4 Future Work Application design for mobile computing is the primary focus of ongoing research on Wit. Most of today's Unix applications are resource intensive, and intolerant of wireless mobile constraints.
