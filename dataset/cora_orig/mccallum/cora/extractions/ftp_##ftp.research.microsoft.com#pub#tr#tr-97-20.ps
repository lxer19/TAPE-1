Reference-contexts: Clever use of redundant encoding allows receivers to simply listen for packets as long as is necessary to receive the full transmission. The simplest implementation of this approach is the data carousel or broadcast disk <ref> [AFZ95] </ref>, which simply repeats the source packets in a particular sequence. More involved schemes send the data packets, and also send encoded packets, designed to correct lost packets, known as erasures in the literature. Erasure-correction will be discussed in more detail, below.

Reference-contexts: For example, parity can be used to implement (k+1, k) encoding. (n,k) encoding and decoding algorithms have been developed that are efficient enough to be used by general purpose personal computers <ref> [RZE97, RZF97, ALO96, LUB97] </ref>. For example, Rizzos public domain codec has been shown to operate at rates of over 11 MB/s on a 133 MHz Pentium and at rates over 350 KB/s on a 25 MHz 386 [RZE97, RZF97].

This is a receiver-initiated approach. Receivers must detect that they have missed a packet and send a NACK to have it resent. However, instead of sending a unicast NACK back to the sender, the NACK is multicast to all participants. <p> Whether it has sent the NACK or suppressed the NACK, it the resets its timer for that packet and repeats the process until the packet its received. The SRM scheme used in wb <ref> [FLO95] </ref> uses NACK suppression, and also allows any node that has cached the data to resend it. In this case, resends must also be suppressed to prevent implosions of resent material.

Reference-contexts: While ECSRM is useful in many applications, we are particularly concerned with telepresentations. A telepresentation is a presentation in which the presenter and/or some of the audience members are not physically present but are telepresent in a different location and/or at a different time <ref> [GEM97] </ref>. We believe that telepresentations will revolutionize education, conferences, training, etc. by reducing associated costs and making the material available to much larger audiences. We have developed a Multicast PowerPoint 1 prototype that utilizes ECSRM.

Some approaches set up the tree in a static way, in which case losing an internal node can have disastrous consequences for its descendents <ref> [HOL95] </ref>. Others dynamically define the tree, rearranging its structure on the fly [TMTP]. Dynamic trees have difficulty achieving stability when the receiver set is rapidly changing.

In the case where large objects (e.g., files) are being transmitted, this can lead to some suboptimality, because an encoded packet can only be used to repair a loss from its EC group, not from the entire object as might be desired.

Reference-contexts: There are four key approaches to making reliable multicast scalable: 1. Error/Erasure correction 2. Hierarchy/localization 3. Suppression 4. Polling.

The simplest implementation of this approach is the data carousel or broadcast disk [AFZ95], which simply repeats the source packets in a particular sequence. <p> The receivers perform NACK suppression. Like ECSRM, a receiver does not NACK a particular packet, but rather indicates how many packets from a particular EC group have been missed. Another example of a reliable multicast protocol using FEC is RMDP, which uses FEC to transmit files <ref> [RZL97] </ref>. Receivers ask the sender to send a file, or to resume sending, if they believe sending has halted. The sender simply cycles the encoded file packets. Erasure Correcting SRM Erasure Correction SRM (ECSRM) modifies SRM to address some of the problems noted above.
