Title: Cooperative goal-satisfaction without communication in large-scale agent-systems  
Author: Onn Shehory and Sarit Kraus 
Abstract: A framework for cooperative goal-satisfaction in large-scale environments is presented in this paper, focusing on a low complexity physics-oriented approach. The multi-agent systems with which we deal are modeled by a physics-oriented model. According to the model, agent-systems inherit physical properties, and therefore the evolution of the computational systems is similar to the evolution of physical systems. To enable implementation of the model, we provide a detailed algorithm to be used by a single agent within the system. The model and the algorithm are appropriate for large-scale Distributed Problem Solver systems, in which agents try to increase the benefits of the whole system. The complexity is very low, and in some specific cases it has proven to be optimal. The analysis and assessment of the algorithm are performed via the well-known behavior and properties of the physical system which models the computational system.

A variety of algorithms for agent-cooperation as a DPS system have been presented <ref> [2] </ref>. Here we are concerned with very large systems of agents where communication is limited and negotiation processes for establishing cooperation are too complex. The solution that we provide for this problem is based on a physics-oriented approach which enable cooperation without negotiation and with limited communication [4].

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Multi-agent systems are designed in order to satisfy goals. Goal-satisfaction may require cooperation among the agents, but cooperative goal-satisfaction may be beneficial even if the agents can perform goals by themselves. Traditional task-allocation methods [13] require coordination via communication <ref> [3] </ref>. However, in very large agent-communities there usually cannot be direct connection between all of the agents, as such a connection is too costly. Therefore, when the number of agents increases, the complexity of most of the cooperation methods becomes unbearable.

We emphasize that our model provides a good solution for cases wherein many agents and many goals are present. Example 1.1 A simple example is a system in which agents must block holes of various sizes in a planar surface.

The issue of allocating agents to goals has widely been discussed among DAI researchers. The Contract Net Protocol <ref> [13] </ref> uses negotiation based on task announcements, bids and contracts for task allocation. While the CNP is based on the exchange of information, the model we present minimizes the transmitted information and thus enables large-scale systems to be efficient.
