Abstract: Technical Report (OSU-CISRC-3/98-TR11), CIS, Ohio State, March 1998 1 Abstract We describe an effective computational method for extracting structural information from spatial data sets. For instance, the structural information such as the location, shape, size, and movement about pressure cells and troughs are important for weather prediction. We are interested in extracting these structures and representing them at aggregate levels where salient geometric features are highlighted. The computational challenge is to quantify these features at multiple levels of granularity and find them incrementally. We introduce two types of spatial adjacency relations for spatial objects and present an effective algorithm for extracting and abstracting structural objects using the relational information. An application to finding local pressure cells in the weather data sets is demonstrated. fl We thank Chris Bailey-Kellogg for constructive comments on an early version of the paper, and Chris and Ivan Ordonez for providing the basic SAL computational environment to experiment with many of the ideas developed in this paper. The work is supported in part by NSF NYI grant CCR-9457802, ONR YI grant N00014-97-1-0599, and a Xerox grant to the Ohio State University.

Reference-contexts: This paper introduces an effective computational mechanism for extracting structural hierarchies from spatial relations in data sets such as weather maps. It is built upon the framework of Spatial Aggregation (SA) that features a multi-layer representation and a set of generic operators to transform the representation <ref> [11] </ref>, and it significantly extends the framework to address how higher-level spatial relations are built from more primitive ones. We choose weather map analysis as our problem domain because of its richness in spatial information. Most weather features are ill-defined. <p> A set of lower-level objects can be aggregated into a higher-level object if they share similarities.
