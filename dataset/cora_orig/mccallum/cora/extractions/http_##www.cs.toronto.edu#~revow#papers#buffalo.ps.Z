Reference-contexts: The search for ff fl is performed using an iterative, continuation type method <ref> [1] </ref>. We start with zero deformations and an initial guess for the affine parameters obtained by centering the model over the image. A small number of gaussian beads of large variance are placed along the spline. All beads have the same variance.

Reference-contexts: If M models are fitted to an image then the 6 fi M measures are used as input to a simple post processing neural network. The network has 10 input vectors (one for each digit), no hidden layers and uses a "softmax" output layer <ref> [2] </ref> with 10 output units. There are no cross-connections between the input vectors and the output units. For example, there 5 There is a small implicit penalty in that beads far from inked pixels are not available for accounting for inked pixels.

Reference-contexts: A recognizer [10] trained to be tolerant to small affine tranformations of the input image had better generalization compared to one that had no explicit knowledge about affine transformations. At the other end of the spectrum are elastic deformable matches <ref> [3, 12] </ref> which attempt to capture all variations with a single model, but using a much more complex matching scheme. We have described an elastic model [8], based on splines and containing just a few parameters which manages to capture many of the variations of a given digit.

Reference-contexts: This is just the probability of generating the pixel from that gaussian, normalized by the total probability of generating the pixel (P ib = P B * Assuming that the responsibilities remain fixed, as in the EM algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>, we invert a 16 fi 16 matrix to find the image locations for the 8 control points at which the forces pulling the control points towards their home locations are balanced by the forces exerted on the control points by the inked pixels.

Reference-contexts: Although we use our digit models for recognizing images, it helps to start by considering how we would use them for generating images. The generative model is an elaboration of the probabilistic interpretation of the elastic net given in <ref> [5] </ref>. To generate a noisy image of a particular digit class, run the following procedure: * Pick a deformation of the model (i.e. move the control points away from their home locations). This defines the spline in object-based coordinates.

Reference-contexts: The number of beads are gradually increased while their variance decreases according to predetermined "annealing" schedule 4 . This fitting technique resembles the elastic net algorithm of Durbin and Willshaw <ref> [6] </ref> except that our elastic energy function is much more complex and we are also fitting an affine transformation. Each iteration of the elastic matching algorithm involves three steps: * Given the current locations of the gaussians, compute the responsibility that each gaussian has for each inked pixel.

Reference-contexts: The loop of a 2, for example, can smoothly turn into a cusp or an open bend. These variants are produced by small changes in the relative locations of the relevant control points. This advantage of spline models is pointed out by <ref> [7] </ref> who use a different kind of spline that they fit to on-line character data by directly locating candidate control points in the image. The deformation energy function only penalizes shape deformations.

Each elastic model contains parameters that define an ideal shape and a deformation energy for departures from this ideal.

Reference-contexts: The description of the generative model in section 3 is deficient as a complete explanation of the image as it does not explicitly penalize fits where there are gaussian beads far from any inked pixels, the "beads in white space" situation 5 . Snakes, <ref> [9] </ref> are spline contours which are attracted to particular features in an image.

Reference-contexts: Unless the images are accurately normalized before matching, this involves a huge number of matches. This number can be significantly reduced by considering affine transformations of digit instances. A recognizer <ref> [10] </ref> trained to be tolerant to small affine tranformations of the input image had better generalization compared to one that had no explicit knowledge about affine transformations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The goal of achieving close to human performance in recognizing hand printed digits remains elusive. A major reason for this failure has been the inability to successfully characterize the wide diversity inherent in handwritten digits, resulting from factors such as regional styles, differing writing instruments and psycho-motoric effects <ref> [11] </ref>. One way to categorize the range of model-based approaches to handling this diversity is to consider the complexity of the procedure used to match model to data (figure 1). Generally as the complexity of the matching increases, the number of models needed decreases.
