Reference-contexts: Similarly, <ref> (Allen 1984) </ref> affirms that `events that appear to refer to a point in time (e.g., finishing a race) are considered to be implicitly referring to another event's beginning or ending'. <p> simple event type, we require the occurrence conditions to be composed only of formulae of the form H olds (s; t) and relations on times, e.g., M eets (i; j). (This is exemplified for a certain class of `motion events' in (Galton 1993).) Our notation will largely follow that of <ref> (Allen 1984) </ref> as far as intervals are concerned, with natural extensions to instants as suggested in (Vilain 1982) and (Galton 1990). As noted above, events in general may be divided into transitions and tenures.

Reference-contexts: Not all models of time can easily be categorised in this way, however. In particular, many researchers have been attracted to models of time which are not discrete but in which there nonetheless exist atomic intervals. The system of <ref> (Allen & Hayes 1989) </ref> is of this kind. They define a moment as an interval with no internal structure; the motivation is to provide times of occurrence for events such as flashes and bangs which do not possess perceptible duration but which are not instantaneous in the strict sense.

Reference-contexts: (s; t) and relations on times, e.g., M eets (i; j). (This is exemplified for a certain class of `motion events' in (Galton 1993).) Our notation will largely follow that of (Allen 1984) as far as intervals are concerned, with natural extensions to instants as suggested in (Vilain 1982) and <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>. As noted above, events in general may be divided into transitions and tenures. <p> I argued in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> that we must also allow a state to hold instantaneously, that is, to hold at an instant without holding over any interval bounded by that instant. If we do not allow this then we cannot have continuous change. <p> a description of an event-type e in a form such as trans (s; s 0 ) or ten (s), how can we determine whether the occurrences of e may, must, or cannot be instantaneous? Let us call this the instantaneity problem. 5.1 States of position and states of motion In <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> I proposed a division of states into two categories, called states of position and states of motion.

Reference-contexts: For a complete reductive account of a simple event type, we require the occurrence conditions to be composed only of formulae of the form H olds (s; t) and relations on times, e.g., M eets (i; j). (This is exemplified for a certain class of `motion events' in <ref> (Galton 1993) </ref>.) Our notation will largely follow that of (Allen 1984) as far as intervals are concerned, with natural extensions to instants as suggested in (Vilain 1982) and (Galton 1990). As noted above, events in general may be divided into transitions and tenures. <p> I pointed out that Allen's interval calculus is adequate for handling states of motion but not for handling states of position. In <ref> (Galton 1993) </ref> I used states of position and states of motion to provide a solution to the instantaneity problem for the motion of a rigid body, insofar as this can be described in terms of transitions using the spatial relation predicates of Randell, Cui, and Cohn. <p> Necessarily durative events. All other cases, i.e., distinct states of motion without a common perturbation, a state of motion and a state of position which are not perturbations of each other, distinct states of position. 8 5.2 A new classification based on `dominance' It was noted in <ref> (Galton 1993) </ref> that for non-rigid bodies the two-fold distinction between states of position and states of motion is inadequate when we consider the motion of a non-rigid body, the example cited being that T P P (pos (b); r) seems to be a state of position when considered as a perturbation
