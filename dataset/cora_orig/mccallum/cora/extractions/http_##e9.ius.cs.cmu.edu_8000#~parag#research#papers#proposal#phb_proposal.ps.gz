Reference-contexts: I see this as learning a policy, in which state predicts action. I will discuss extensions to my current work along these lines, along with the use of locally weighted learning <ref> [1] </ref> in Section 7.4. While the first approach is conceptually simple, the second approach has advantages that may make it worthwhile. For instance, if a set of driver classes could be determined, it may be faster to classify the driver than to learn a new model for it. <p> In particular, using architectures which explicitly encode temporal relationships such as BackProp Through Time [20] may improve performance and learning speed. I will also look at how memory based learning (MBL) could be applied to the problem. One advantage of MBL, or locally weighted regression (LWR) <ref> [1] </ref>, is that training is essentially cost-free (although this is at the expense of query time). Using MBL also simplifies the training set management that would be required for a neural net approach. Confidence measures can be derived for specific situations, allowing incremental learning to proceed more quickly.

Reference-contexts: However, their system is not adaptive as it does not take advantage of differences in braking onset or speed through curves. There has been some work on infrastructure based warning systems. Bergan et al. <ref> [5] </ref> determine weight, type, speed and deceleration to determine if a truck is in danger of tipping over. They use infrastructure mounted sensors to determine these variables, and use a sign to alert the driver. Fukuda [16] uses a road mounted microwave doppler radar to measure vehicle speed along curves.

Reference-contexts: True Negative: A situation in which the driver, in hindsight, does not believe his actions would result in an ROR crash, and no alarm triggered. This is by far the most common outcome. Burgett <ref> [6] </ref> presents definitions of system efficiency, which is discussed in Section 6.2 of this proposal. <p> Quantitative Analysis The most effective quantitative analysis for a system like this is to measure how many lives are saved. Unfortunately, that is not an easy statistic to determine. In similar situations, other researchers such as Tijerina [43] and Burgett <ref> [6] </ref> have taken a step back, and looked at the situation immediately before an event that they wish to measure. It is likely there are more lane departures than fatalities, as not every departure results in a death or accident.

Reference-contexts: Stochastic and non-linear effects, such as crosswind response, cannot be modeled well using these approaches. Furthermore, it becomes very difficult to take into account environmental effects such as the presence of other vehicles.

There is not much detail on how many people participated, or even if they were researchers or picked from a random population. A preliminary result in driver adaptation is also presented [32].

Reference-contexts: This work showed that information on the upcoming road curvature helps to eliminate the effects of perceptual and reaction lag. Crossman and Szostak <ref> [12] </ref> proposed a three level model which combined open loop control of vehicle curvature given upcoming road information, with closed loops around lateral position and lateral velocity.

Reference-contexts: Third, their dependence on a situational analysis model requires them to manually define all the situations a driver may encounter. Finally, the system makes no allowance for changes in driver behavior over time. 2.6. Crewmans Associate for Path Control (CAPC) The CAPC system <ref> [13] </ref>, developed at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, is a prototype vehicle which implements a TLC based lane departure warning. While the goal of the project was to build a driver-adaptive system, the current implementation uses hardcoded TLC thresholds.

Reference-contexts: The results showed that their ID3 derived rules, which looked at vehicle speed and acceleration, were able to trigger downshifts when the driver expected them. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute has conducted a large study of how driver characteristics inuence headway maintenance <ref> [14] </ref>, [39]. They loaned vehicles equipped with a prototype adaptive cruise control (ACC) system to over 100 drivers who were going on long trips. The ACC system allowed the user to set a desired headway, and would decelerate the vehicle if the constraint was violated.

Reference-contexts: Neural Network Based Warning System One possible method of implementing a driver adaptive warning system is to use a neural net to predict the drivers actions based on previous driving examples. Feraric <ref> [15] </ref> and Nechyba [29] have taken this approach. My own experiments take a time series of vehicle state as input, and attempt to predict steering wheel position or vehicle curvature. The purpose of running these experiments is not to determine if a neural net can learn to drive.

Reference-contexts: Daisy The Driver Assisting System (DAISY) [15],[31] is a comprehensive driver adaptive warning system, geared to give warnings based on a time reserve, which is a combination of time to lane crossing (TLC) <ref> [17] </ref>, along with time to collision (with other vehicles or obstacles). The system consists of a situation analysis monitor, which uses petri-nets to classify the current situation given environmental inputs, such as the pose of surrounding vehicles. Car following and lane keeping are provided as examples of tactical situations. <p> space (where state space includes vehicle pose and control input) does the driver normally affect changes in the control input? How are these changes related to surrounding vehicles and roadway geometry? Simply determining a TLC threshold is not appropriate, however, as that assumes that people drive as hypothesized by Godthelp <ref> [17] </ref>, and that has not been proven. More likely, there are other metrics which need to be included, such as steering wheel reversal rate. Knipling and Wierwille [22] define a set of metrics for use in drowsy driver detection. Some of those may be appropriate for this work. 5.2.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the training is all done off-line, using recorded data, and a simulated model of the test vehicle. This is because a Genetic Algorithm <ref> [18] </ref> is used to optimize network specific parameters, such as the relative weights of each feature in the tactical feature vector, which changes given different tactical situations.

Reference-contexts: Driver perception is therefore very important in classifying an alarm. The definitions of a system designer are irrelevant if the end user does not agree with them. Hadden et al. <ref> [19] </ref> have done a simulation study of lane departure countermeasure effectiveness. The particulars of the study are discussed in Section 2.1. However, during analysis of the results, they put forth 6 possible outcomes of a countermeasure intervention. <p> This implies that grossly, these departures are similar to lane changes. However, the actual numbers derived have to be taken with a grain of salt, as the methodology was very inexact, due to the limited information available characterizing the crash. In a later phase of this work <ref> [19] </ref> the authors performed a simulation study to look at the effectiveness of TLC in preventing ROR crashes. They split up an ROR crashes into two possible cases: the first is a 1-tire ROR, which means at least one front tire has crossed a lane boundary.

Reference-contexts: I will have to explore the data I have further to determine what other differences exist, and how to exploit them. I will also investigate other neural architectures. In particular, using architectures which explicitly encode temporal relationships such as BackProp Through Time <ref> [20] </ref> may improve performance and learning speed. I will also look at how memory based learning (MBL) could be applied to the problem.

Reference-contexts: Most likely, this bias is due to minor shifts in camera yaw between runs. While the bias in curvature can be subtracted out, the possible shift in camera position may also cause a small error in the lane position estimate. However, Pomerleau <ref> [34] </ref> has determined that while a 1 degree shift in camera yaw can cause a straight road to appear as a 1200m radius curvature, the overall effect on lane displacement in negligible due to redundancy in the method used by RALPH to calculate lane position. 4.1.2. <p> Passengers have reported <ref> [34] </ref> surprise at the lack of an alarm when the vehicle drifts a bit into the shoulder during a curve, because in other situations (i.e., straight roads), a similar lane position has resulted in an alarm.

Reference-contexts: This problem has significance because of the number of traffic fatalities which result from ROR crashes. Preventing a portion of these accidents would have a real impact in the number of lives saved. Current warning systems, such as Pomerleaus RALPH warning system <ref> [35] </ref> use physics based models, such as looking at the position of the vehicle in the lane, or looking at the direction the vehicle is pointing relative to the lane and calculating a time to lane crossing metric. <p> However, this result is an indication that driver behavior does change over time. Further evidence of this is presented in Section 4.3. 2.7. RALPH The RALPH lane tracking system <ref> [35] </ref>, described in Section 3, includes a lane departure warning system (which from now on will be referred to as RALPH-WS, for RALPH Warning System) which depends on TLC. The TLC is calculated by using estimates of lateral velocity and current lane position. <p> Blind Spot Sensor 3m ~70 degrees Binary only 34m 36m blindspot Radar Right Side Sensor Left Side Sensor Laser A C are sensed, vehicle D is in a blind spot. 17 Driver Adaptive Warning Systems 4/1/98 3.2. RALPH The RALPH system <ref> [35] </ref> combines a lane tracker (RALPH), lane departure warning system (RALPH-WS), obstacle map generator (OPIE), and vehicle controller (PILOT). Besides these four main modules, there are numerous libraries developed to interface to different sensors and controller hardware.

Reference-contexts: I believe that on board systems, particularly adaptive ones which alert the driver that he is doing something not normal for him, will ultimately prove more effective at reducing accidents during curve negotiation. 2.9. Other Work Takahashi and Kuroda [41] used ID3 <ref> [36] </ref>, a decision tree induction algorithm, to design a controller which anticipates the intention of a driver going downhill to downshift for engine braking. The results showed that their ID3 derived rules, which looked at vehicle speed and acceleration, were able to trigger downshifts when the driver expected them.

Reference-contexts: In other words, can it learn an interesting driver characteristic that is specific to the training driver, and is consistent over different examples of the same driver? 4.4.1. Neural Net Architecture The architecture I have chosen for my experiments is a multi-layer perceptron using the Error Backpropagation (BP) <ref> [38] </ref> training algorithm. BP is simple, yet powerful enough to capture non-linear effects, and trains fairly quickly. It is therefore worth trying before testing more complicated learning schemes.

Reference-contexts: The results showed that their ID3 derived rules, which looked at vehicle speed and acceleration, were able to trigger downshifts when the driver expected them. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute has conducted a large study of how driver characteristics inuence headway maintenance [14], <ref> [39] </ref>. They loaned vehicles equipped with a prototype adaptive cruise control (ACC) system to over 100 drivers who were going on long trips. The ACC system allowed the user to set a desired headway, and would decelerate the vehicle if the constraint was violated. <p> The first is to loan out Navlab 8 to drivers who are going on extended trips, and allow them to try out both my new warning system, and the RALPH warning system. This is similar to what was done by Sayer et al. <ref> [39] </ref> to evaluate their ACC system. Alternatively, it may be possible to develop a version of the RALPH lane tracker and warning system that is easy to install in subjects vehicles. Work is already in progress on this.

Reference-contexts: Another situation in which the environment should modulate the warning system is in collision avoidance maneuvers. A driver may swerve onto the shoulder to avoid hitting an obstacle, such as an animal or tire. Sukthankar <ref> [40] </ref> dealt with surrounding vehicles at the tactical level by using potential fields. This could be a promising approach for my work as well. The strength of the field would depend on the location of the vehicle and individual behavior, which is to be learned. 5.5.

Reference-contexts: In area with wide shoulders, this is appropriate. However, on narrow stretches of road, a higher threshold is needed. 2.8. Curve Negotiation Warning Work There has not been much work done in vehicle based curve warning systems, and none on adaptive curve warning systems. Tamura <ref> [42] </ref> describes heuristics to determine whether or not a given speed is appropriate for an upcoming curve. They also use a custom GPS map to localize themselves and provide warning of upcoming curves.

Reference-contexts: Other studies have used TLC thresholds of 0.7s and 1.3s <ref> [43] </ref>. I chose 1.0 to increase the warning time, and to take into account the experimental effect of the driver perhaps driving more carefully. The column of Table 9 marked Warning Time Gain shows the increase in warning time provided by the NN system over the TLC system. <p> Quantitative Analysis The most effective quantitative analysis for a system like this is to measure how many lives are saved. Unfortunately, that is not an easy statistic to determine. In similar situations, other researchers such as Tijerina <ref> [43] </ref> and Burgett [6] have taken a step back, and looked at the situation immediately before an event that they wish to measure. It is likely there are more lane departures than fatalities, as not every departure results in a death or accident. <p> Another idea is to use the test track at the Transportation Research Center facility in Columbus, Ohio. This would allow for controlled experiments to intentionally distract the driver, such as in the Iowa simulator study <ref> [43] </ref>, which could not be conducted on a public highway. 7. Proposed Work I address many issues in Section 5. I do not believe that I will be able to solve each of them completely.

Reference-contexts: Of the 37,000 fatal accidents in 1996, over 21,000 were single vehicle accidents. These 21,000 accidents resulted in 22,500 fatalities, or 56% of the total <ref> [44] </ref>. The combined cost of all accidents is estimated to be over $150 billion per year. Intuitively, most people would agree that different people drive differently. We have all seen people weaving wildly on the road. For some, this may indicate an incapacitation, such as fatigue or drunkenness.

Reference-contexts: The technology developed here will be applicable towards making lane keeping assistance systems which attempt to keep the driver in a groove that he is used to, as opposed to the center of the lane, as current systems do <ref> [45] </ref>. The adaptive curve warning component could also be used to enhance the drivers comfort while using ACC systems by braking in curves where the driver normally would. A further contribution is an evaluation of the system by untrained users.

Reference-contexts: Over the next few decades, that work was expanded upon, as the model of the driver became more complicated and attempted to take into account evidence provided by studies of driver behavior. Wierwille <ref> [46] </ref>, who has been active in this field for many years, presented an early model which took into account past lateral displacement, future roadway curvature, and driver vantage point. This work showed that information on the upcoming road curvature helps to eliminate the effects of perceptual and reaction lag.

Reference-contexts: They showed that younger drivers tend to maintain a closer headway, and selected the lowest setting when in ACC mode. This study is one of the only large scale user studies ever conducted, and the volume of data collected will be very useful for longitudinal driver modeling. Zhao <ref> [47] </ref> is using multiple Kalman filters to track vehicles using vision. She uses separate filters tuned to in-lane driving and lane changes and is therefore able to track low level in-lane motion as well as tactical level motion.
