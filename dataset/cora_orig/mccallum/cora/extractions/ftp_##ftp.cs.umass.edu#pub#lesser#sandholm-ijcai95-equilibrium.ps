Title: Equilibrium Analysis of the Possibilities of Unenforced Exchange in Multiagent Systems

Abstract: In multiagent systems, interaction protocols are usually enforced by law. Enforcement is problematic among computational agents, because they may operate under incomplete or different laws, the laws may not be uniformly enforced, and the agents can vanish easily. This paper presents an enforcement free method for carrying out exchanges so that both agents are motivated to abide to their contract. This is achieved by splitting the exchanged goods into partial exchanges so that at each step, both agents benefit more from the future of the exchange than from vanishing with the goods or payment. The conditions for such exchange are presented in general, and the maximum deliveries and payments|for any point in the exchange|are solved for. Similar analysis is carried out for the case, where the agents' current actions affect their future contracts. Strategic delaying is also discussed. The paper presents a fast algorithm that will find a sequence of independent partial deliveries in a way that enables unenforced exchange if such a sequence exists. This problem cannot be solved in polynomial time if the partial deliveries are interdependent. Finally, the paper shows that the unenforced exchange scheme hinders unfair renegotiation. 1

Reference-contexts: We will call a sequence of deliveries and payments safe if neither agent is motivated to defect at any point in the exchange. The basic idea of enhancing cooperation by making the present less im portant compared to the future has been suggested for example in <ref> [ Axelrod, 1984 ] </ref> . We propose an exchange strategy manager module to be added to each agent's architecture. This module is potentially different for each agent.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that contracts should also fulfill the condition of ex post rationality: abiding to the contract should be desirable to the agents at each step of the carrying out of the contract. Ex post conditions were studied in mul-tiagent planning without payments in <ref> [ Brainov, 1994 ] </ref> . This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 handles one exchange in isolation. Conditions for safe exchange are derived and an inherent restriction concerning the completion of the exchange is identified.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the laws cannot be enforced unless the terminated agent represented some real world party and the connection between the agent and the real world party can be traced. For example, the Telescript technology <ref> [ General Magic, Inc., 1994 ] </ref> follows the approach of strictly trying to tie each agent to its real world party. On the contrary, we analyze exchanges among more autonomous agents and study possibilities of exchange without enforcement (e.g. with unknown real world parties or no litigation possibility).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the supplier knows that any point in the exchange is safe for the demander. Therefore, if the supplier can commit to not renegotiating, the demander is motivated to follow the original contract and to not vanish.

Reference-contexts: Such chunks cannot be further split, and we assume in this section that the delivery order of the chunks is fixed. For example in the TRACONET (TRAnsportation COoperation NET) multiagent sys tem <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> , agents representing dispatch centers negotiated over who's vehicles should transport 2 If equality holds, the agent is indifferent between cooperating and defecting. Throughout this paper we assume that indifferent agents will cooperate. <p> Taking care of one parcel is an atomic chunk because the task cannot be split. Sometimes a contract between two agents involved multiple tasks (in order to avoid local optima in distributed task allocation <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> ) so the total exchange could have been split into smaller parts. The following theorems describe the conditions for safe exchange of discrete goods.
