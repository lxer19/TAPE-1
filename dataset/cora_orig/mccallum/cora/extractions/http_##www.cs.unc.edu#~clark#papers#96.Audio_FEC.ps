Title: The Case for FEC-Based Error Control for Packet Audio in the Internet

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributing real-time packet audio over networks such as the Internet which do not provide support for real-time applications. Experiments with such networks indicate that audio quality is mediocre in large part because of excessive audio packet losses. In this paper, we show using measurements over the Internet as well as analytic modeling that most loss periods involve a small number of audio packets (i.e. the number of consecutively lost audio packets is small) unless the network load is high. This result indicates that open loop error control mechanisms based on forward error correction would be adequate to re construct many lost audio packets. We describe one such mechanism and report on its performance.

Reference-contexts: Thus, 2 we also consider the conditional probability that a packet is lost given that the previous packet was lost. We denote clp = P [l n+1 = 1jl n = 1]. The average length of a loss period is then given by 1=(1 clp) <ref> [1] </ref>. We have measured the audio loss process over a number of connections, i.e. of source-destination pairs. In this paper, we focus on one specitc connection between INRIA Sophia Antipolis in southern France and University College London (UCL) in the UK.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, they are not well suited to multicast environments such as the MBone. FEC is an attractive alternative to ARQ for providing reliability without increasing latency. This is particularly important for applications with real time constraints over high speed networks <ref> [17, 2] </ref>. However, the potential of FEC mechanisms to recover from losses depends crucially on the characteristics of the packet loss process in the network. Clearly, FEC mechanisms are more eective when the average number of consecutively lost packets is small.

Reference-contexts: In summary, the results presented above indicate that i) most loss periods involve one or two audio packets, and ii) the distribution of the number of consecutively lost packets is approximately geometric. This is in agreement with previous experimental <ref> [3] </ref> and analytic [13, 16] results. However, it is dicult with the experimental approach taken in this section to quantify the impact of the network load on the audio loss process. This is because it is essentially impossible to control the load of the network. <p> exible way than can be done with experiments only. 3 A model for packet audio over the Internet The model is based on previous results which indicate that the impact of the Internet trac on a periodic stream of packets can be approximated by that of a batch Bernoulli trac <ref> [3] </ref>. Therefore, we model our experiments with a simple single-server queueing model with 2 input streams, where one stream represents the audio trac and the other stream represents the Internet trac. The model 7 is shown in Figure 5. <p> Specitcally, we denote by b i the probability that the size of the Internet packet is i fi P bytes. The value of b i can be either estimated from end to end delay measurements of audio packets <ref> [3] </ref>, or chosen so as to match recently developed empirical models of Internet trac [5]. Both methods indicate, that the Internet packet size distribution is a multimodal distribution. <p> Not surprisingly, our results tie in well with those in [16] (since we use a model similar to theirs) which indicate that loss periods are short as long as the periodic stream uses less than 10% of the server capacity. They are also in agreement with others in <ref> [13, 3] </ref>. Interestingly, many analytic studies in the literature conclude that packet losses are bursty. However, it is important to consider carefully the hypotheses made regarding the trac model [6]. Many such studies consider the aggregate loss process at a node, i.e. the loss process from all input streams.

Reference-contexts: In these tests, 3 groups of 7 subjects listened to sequences of phonetically balanced words. The subjects completed a Mean Opin ion Score (MOS) rating scale and compared FEC mechanisms based on silence substitution, packet repetition, and LPC redundant coding. The results (de tailed in <ref> [7] </ref>) indicate that packet repetition is better than silence substitution, but its MOS rating drops rapidly as the loss rate exceeds some threshold around 20%. However, the MOS obtained with the LPC scheme hardly decreases even as the loss rate reaches 30%.

Reference-contexts: The interval between these periods is approximately 40 ms fi 2200 88 s. Therefore, it seems likely that such losses are triggered by the periodic overload caused at routers by the synchronization of IGRP routing update messages every 90 seconds <ref> [8] </ref>. In other experiments, we have observed loss periods with lengths reaching up to 1000. Clearly, the presence of only a few such loss periods is enough to signitcantly impact moments of the loss process.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it is possible to recover at the destination from packet losses without any redundant information. For example, a lost packet can be replaced by silence or by noise. A better way is to reconstruct it by duplicating the previous packet <ref> [9] </ref>. A large variety of more elaborate FEC mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. Many such mechanisms involve exclusive-OR operations, the idea being to send every nth packet a redundant packet obtained by exclusive-ORing the other n packets [17].

Reference-contexts: IP/UDP/RTP. In multicast mode, audio packets are sent between the same source destination pair as in unicast mode, but they are sent over the MBone using the multicast extension to IP <ref> [10] </ref>. Experiments carried out between INRIA and UCL consisted of transmitting 30 000 audio packets. The packets were generated by the PCM coder from pre-recorded 45 minute long audio tles. The coder includes a silence detection mechanism. Thus, packets are sent only during talkspurts.

Reference-contexts: Within the MICE project (a European project devoted to multimedia re search), we have developed a novel mechanism for loss recovery <ref> [11] </ref>. Consider for example the case when audio is sent using PCM encoding. In our mecha nism, packet n includes in addition to its encoded PCM samples, a redundant version of packet n 1 obtained with a low bit rate coder.

Reference-contexts: One approach is to extend current protocols and switch scheduling disci plines to provide the services desired by real-time applications. This approach requires that admission control, reservation, and scheduling mechanisms be im plemented in the network.

Thus, we have pursued another approach in which applica tions adapt to the best eort service currently provided by the network.
