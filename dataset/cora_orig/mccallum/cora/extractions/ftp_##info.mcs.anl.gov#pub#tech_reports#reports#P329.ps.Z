Reference-contexts: In <ref> [2] </ref>, we showed that there is a unique R (R &gt; 0) and a unique positive-valued function u on (0; R), such that u is the radial solution of the differential equation which satisfies the boundary conditions u (R) = 0, u 0 (R) = 0. (A radial solution depends only <p> The existence and uniqueness of such a solution follow from <ref> [2] </ref>. The function u is monotone on (0; R). 2 The Result We prove the following result. Theorem 1 For each q 2 [0; 1), there is a unique R &gt; 0 such that (1:1); (1:2) admits a (classical ) solution u that is positive everywhere on (0; R). <p> conclude that R = O ((1 q) 1=2 ) as q ! 1. 3 The Proof Using a shooting argument, we replace the boundary value problem (1.1), (1.2) by the initial value problem u 00 + r u (0) = fl; u 0 (0) = 0: (3:2) The results of <ref> [2] </ref> imply that, for any q 2 [0; 1), there is a unique fl &gt; 1 such that the solution of (3.1), (3.2) decreases from fl to meet the r-axis with zero slope at some value R &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Now, v (r) is a constant multiple of r J (r (1 q) 1=2 ), where J is the Bessel function of the first kind of order |see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>. Hence, v (r) = 1 for some value r &lt; j ;1 =(1 q) 1=2 , where j ;1 is the first positive zero of J . <p> Take any r 2 (0; j ;1 =ffi). It follows from the Kneser-Sommerfeld expansion <ref> [3, Section 15.42] </ref> that J (ffis)Y (ffir) Y (ffis)J (ffir) = 4ffirJ (ffir) J (ffis) 1 X (J (j ;n s=r)) (j 2 ;n (ffir) 2 )j ;n J 02 (j ;n ) for 0 s r. <p> fJ (ffis)Y (ffir) Y (ffis)J (ffir)g f (w (s)) ds r (g (ffir)) (1q) 1 fl 1q 1 ae Z ae fJ (z)Y (ae) Y (z)J (ae)g z +1 dz ae=ffir : (3.24) The expression in square brackets can be evaluated by means of the recurrence formulae for Bessel functions <ref> [3, Section 3.2] </ref> and the resulting expression can be simplified further by means of the Wronskian [3, Section 3.63], ae Z ae fJ (z)Y (ae) Y (z)J (ae)g z +1 dz = 1 g (ae): (3:25) We estimate this expression by substituting the series expansion for the Bessel function J and <p> 1q 1 ae Z ae fJ (z)Y (ae) Y (z)J (ae)g z +1 dz ae=ffir : (3.24) The expression in square brackets can be evaluated by means of the recurrence formulae for Bessel functions [3, Section 3.2] and the resulting expression can be simplified further by means of the Wronskian <ref> [3, Section 3.63] </ref>, ae Z ae fJ (z)Y (ae) Y (z)J (ae)g z +1 dz = 1 g (ae): (3:25) We estimate this expression by substituting the series expansion for the Bessel function J and truncating after the first term, 1 g (ae) = 1 2 ( + 1)ae J (ae) <p> These inequalities follow from the interlacing property of the zeros of Bessel functions, 0 &lt; j ;1 &lt; j +1;1 &lt; j ;2 &lt; j +1;2 &lt; j ;3 &lt; : : : ; cf. <ref> [3, Section 15.22] </ref>.
