Reference-contexts: From this perspective, there is no reason to suppose that the mechanisms of plasticity differ in the adult and the infant. However, this is unlikely to be the full explanation, since even single cells in V1 demonstrate decay of adaptation effects <ref> (Albrecht et al. 1984) </ref>; though of course the single-cellular decay could be caused by feedback from higher levels as they reorganize. Another less extravagant explanation may be that changes in synaptic effectiveness are merely a side-effect of limits on synaptic transmission at particular excitatory connections.

Reference-contexts: Activated areas experienced satiation, which would result in displacement of subsequent perceptions to unsatiated areas. This metaphor was apparently inspired by the beginnings of electronic technology at the time; no physiological evidence for fields of this nature has ever been found <ref> (Barlow 1990) </ref>. <p> The model is a formal expression of the information processing principle of decorrelation, that is, the reduction of redundancy in an image or other sensory data. All natural images are redundant to some extent, and the nervous system appears to make wide use of this fact <ref> (Barlow 1990) </ref>. The amount of redundancy may be expressed in terms of correlations: two pieces of information that are highly correlated with each other could in theory be represented as a single entity, and thus they contain redundant information. <p> This thesis suggests a much simpler interpretation which is also supported by clear physiological evidence. When an 72 aftereffect occurs in the model, it is always a result of changes in the connection strength between neurons, not a nonspecific change in the neuron itself (cf. <ref> (Barlow 1990) </ref>). The model does not contain any representation of the state of the neuron, whose response changes only when its inputs or connection weights change. Under these assumptions, there is no difficulty in explaining the differences between the effects of various drugs on the TAE and TI. <p> Such studies might help clarify how and when adaptation occurs in the early visual system. 6.4.7 Other visual aftereffects Aftereffects appear to be a nearly universal feature of cortical sensory processing <ref> (Barlow 1990) </ref>. Many visual aftereffects similar to the TAE have been documented in humans, including aftereffects of curvature, motion, spatial frequency, size, position, and color (Barlow 1990; Howard and Templeton 1966; Wolfe 1984).

Reference-contexts: If each level has the same structure, the patterns produced by a given level could interact in that level and later levels <ref> (Berkley et al. 1993) </ref>, conceivably causing tilt illusions and tilt aftereffects between features not present in the original image. Hierarchical levels of RF-LISSOM models have been proposed by Sirosh (1995) as a possible implementation of the visual processing hierarchy described by Van Essen et al. (1992).

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon arises for the TAE when multiple adaptation figures with different orientations are presented simultaneously.

This result follows simply from having more detectors activated, and thus more detectors fatigued. However, such adaptation actually reduces the amount of the TAE (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980a).

Reference-contexts: Thus one simple way to combine genetic and environmental factors is for entirely gene-based development to progress to a certain point, e.g. birth or shortly thereafter, and then transfer developmental control to a learning mechanism <ref> (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975) </ref>. This seems particularly appropriate in organisms such as mammals that have a long gestation period, during which their ability to measure the environment is severely limited. <p> Since it must start from a single cell, it would need a set of bootstrapping mechanisms to construct the "preset" pattern determined by the genome. These mechanisms would have to be quite complex to account for the complex structures seen even at birth in mammals <ref> (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975) </ref>. At some point determined by the genome, control would shift to the learning mechanism, and the cellular or intracellular structures used for bootstrapping would need to be deactivated or perhaps even dismantled. <p> Cumulatively, the above constraints strongly discourage large-scale fully-specific hardwiring, yet somehow most organisms (including humans) develop with a large degree of structure already present at birth <ref> (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975) </ref>. The next section explores an alternative, complementary hypothesis for combining genetic and environmental factors that addresses these considerations, and the following section will review evidence that it is actually occurring in several systems of mammals. <p> An RF-LISSOM model trained on a non-uniform training distribution with a preponderance of horizontal and vertical lines develops more detectors for horizontal and vertical orientations. This type of adaptation has also been observed in kittens raised in deprived visual environments <ref> (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975) </ref>. Such an anisotropic distribution is probably typical of the early visual experience of humans (Mansfield 1974).

Reference-contexts: It has further been proposed that the spontaneous activity is responsible for maintaining topographic maps during the growth of the connecting pathways from the retina to the LGN <ref> (Bunt et al. 1979) </ref>. That is, when the ganglion cells of the retina extend axons forming the optic nerve, they would keep a retinotopic order as a result of activity-dependent processes driven by these retinal waves. <p> Throughout the developmental process, they would remain in this retinotopic order until they reached the LGN. This proposal has not been definitively established, but there is some evidence for the proposed mechanisms and results <ref> (Bunt et al. 1979) </ref>. If it turns out to be well-supported, it would take still more of the burden off of the genetic factors in development.

Reference-contexts: The vertical lines should appear slightly tilted to the right; this phenomenon is called the direct tilt aftereffect. If you fixate upon the horizontal lines at the right, they may appear slightly tilted counterclockwise, though not every observer reports this indirect tilt aftereffect. <ref> (Adapted from Campbell and Maffei 1971.) </ref> ically Self-Organizing Map, or RF-LISSOM; Miikkulainen et al. 1997; Sirosh and Miikkulai-nen 1997; Sirosh et al. 1996) has been shown to develop feature detectors and specific lateral connections that could produce such illusions and aftereffects. <p> Note that for overlapping lines, the largest possible separation is 90 ffi due to symmetry (figure 2.5). Early studies found tilt aftereffects only for horizontal or vertical test lines (Gibson and Radner 1937), as did some later studies <ref> (Campbell and Maffei 1971) </ref>. <p> power is available and the model is extended as described, RF-LISSOM is expected to account for these experimental observations as well: Higher variance at oblique orientations: The TAE versus angle curve shows greater variance for oblique testing orientations (Mitchell and Muir 1976), often sufficiently high to entirely mask the effect <ref> (Campbell and Maffei 1971) </ref>. The variance may result from the smaller number of detectors in the fovea subserving angles that are neither horizontal nor vertical (Bauer et al. 1991; Mansfield 1974).

Reference-contexts: That is, only a small range of frequency detectors will be activated by a given stimulus, so only that range will show adaptation effects. Movement direction specificity: The TAE is selective for the direction of movement <ref> (Carney 1982) </ref>. Adapting on a pattern moving in one direction past a fixation point does not affect the orientation judgment of a pattern moving in the opposite direction. A unified orientation/movement direction RF-LISSOM model, obtained by training on oriented Gaussians moving in different directions, would exhibit this property as well.

Reference-contexts: Since typical test figures activate a large number of nearby neurons, increasing the strength of the inhibitory connections between them would also produce the observed desensitization. Such an explanation also accounts for similar effects between nearby stimuli presented simultaneously, known as the tilt illusion <ref> (Carpenter and Blakemore 1973) </ref>. The two tilt effects have very similar characteristics along a number of different dimensions, so related explanations have generally been expected (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980b; Tolhurst and Thompson 1975). <p> illusion <ref> (Carpenter and Blakemore 1973) </ref>. The two tilt effects have very similar characteristics along a number of different dimensions, so related explanations have generally been expected (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980b; Tolhurst and Thompson 1975). The inhibition theory also correctly accounts for the phenomenon of disinhibition documented for the tilt illusion (Carpenter and Blakemore 1973) and the tilt aftereffect 13 (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980a). This phenomenon arises for the TAE when multiple adaptation figures with different orientations are presented simultaneously. <p> However, it is unknown precisely how the higher visual areas extract the encoding of orientation from figure 4.6 and arrive at the perception of an individual oriented line. It has been suggested that the perceived orientation is either the orientation preference of the unit with the highest activation <ref> (Carpenter and Blakemore 1973) </ref>, or a weighted average 44 (a) Afferent weights (b) Excitatory weights (c) Inhibitory weights +90 ffi +45 ffi 0 ffi -45 ffi -90 ffi and after self-organization (bottom row, after 30,000 iterations). The weights are colored as in figure 4.4.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the perceived orientation is some sort of weighted average over the orientation preferences of the activated neurons, the perceived orientation would thus show the direct TAE <ref> (Coltheart 1971) </ref>. Sutherland (1961) proposed such an explanation originally, and Coltheart (1971) extended it to account for indirect effects. Coltheart noted that some neurons (here called cross-neurons) had been discovered that had two preferred orientations, each orthogonal to the other (Hubel and Wiesel 1965, 1968). <p> The neuron is colored yellow because it has a very slight preference for +30 ffi , but neighboring neurons of all orientation preferences connect to it. of the preferences of all active units <ref> (Coltheart 1971) </ref>. An intermediate method could also be used, computing an average of all the units having activity greater than some arbitrary activity level. In order to determine if a choice between these methods is crucial, the two extreme options were tested for the RF-LISSOM model. <p> However, as described in section 2.3.4, no consensus has emerged about the cause of the indirect TAE. Over the years, it has been proposed to result from a "linkage" between the vertical and horizontal axes (Gibson and Radner 1937), adaptation of cells with multiple preferred orientations <ref> (Coltheart 1971) </ref>, a three-lobed lateral interaction profile (O'Toole and Wenderoth 1977), and direct effects arising from an invisible "virtual axis" of symmetry (Wenderoth et al. 1989). The linkage explanation was disproved by the finding that indirect and direct effects are similar at all absolute orientations (Mitchell and Muir 1976).

Reference-contexts: But there would be distinct differences in the biochemical mechanisms for the effects | the TI requires only that the lateral inhibitory connections be functional, while the TAE requires that their strength be modifiable. Many substances have been shown to affect plasticity without otherwise altering function <ref> (Daw 1995, ch.12) </ref>. Similarly, since the inhibitory connections are polysynaptic, other substances could interfere with the effect of lateral inhibition on the target cell without disrupting adaptation occurring earlier in the pathway. <p> Although recent work suggests that there are a number of synaptic plasticity mechanisms which operate the same way in adults and infants (Artola and Singer 1987; Kandel and O'Dell 1992; Kirkwood and Bear 1994; Kirkwood et al. 1993), in general cortical plasticity appears much more limited in the adult <ref> (Daw 1995) </ref>. The steady decay of the tilt aftereffect in complete darkness may be a manifestation of differences between adult and developmental plasticity.

Reference-contexts: The relative weights of these factors have been debated for hundreds of years <ref> (for review see Diamond 1974) </ref>, but recent evidence is beginning to clarify how development actually occurs in the nervous system. This section will first sketch the very general constraints that apply to a developing organism and the tradeoffs involved in satisfying them.

Reference-contexts: Sparse codes minimize the number of active neurons in the cortex, and are well suited for the detection of suspicious coincidences, pattern recognition, 24 associative memory and feature grouping <ref> (Field 1994, Barlow 1972, 1985, 1990) </ref>. Prior work has demonstrated that the coding of visual input produced by the RF-LISSOM model is sparse in this sense (Miikkulainen et al. 1997; Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1996, 1997; Sirosh et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: Another less extravagant explanation may be that changes in synaptic effectiveness are merely a side-effect of limits on synaptic transmission at particular excitatory connections. This would act as a form of connection-specific fatigue <ref> (Geisler 1997) </ref>. During presentation of an adaptation pattern, the ability of the connection to carry action potentials would decrease, resulting in a direct TAE. As resources are replenished, the effects of adaptation would decrease, thus explaining why decay occurs.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The tilt aftereffect <ref> (TAE, Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref> is a simple but intriguing visual phenomenon. After staring at a pattern of tilted lines or gratings, subsequent lines appear to have a slight tilt in the opposite direction. Figure 1.1 demonstrates the effect. <p> Note that for overlapping lines, the largest possible separation is 90 ffi due to symmetry (figure 2.5). Early studies found tilt aftereffects only for horizontal or vertical test lines <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>, as did some later studies (Campbell and Maffei 1971). <p> The magnitude of the TAE increases logarithmically with increasing adaptation time and decreases logarithmically with time elapsed since the adaptation period <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>. However, the magnitude of the effect saturates at approximately 4 ffi (Campbell and Maffei 1971; Greenlee and Magnussen 1987; Magnussen and Johnsen 1986; Mitchell and Muir 1976). <p> The TAE is localized to what appear to be a specific set of orientation detectors. It is spatially localized on the retina <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>; adaptation for a figure in one location has no measurable effect on test figures in other locations sufficiently distant. <p> 6, it may be possible to obtain similar plots for the cortex to compare with these results. 5.5 Time course of the tilt aftereffect In addition to the angular changes in the TAE described in the previous sections, the magnitude of the TAE in humans increases regularly with adaptation time <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>. The equivalent of "time" in the RF-LISSOM model is an iteration, i.e. a single cycle of input presentation, activity propagation, settling, and weight modification. Figure 5.9 shows how the TAE varies for each angle as the number of adaptation iterations is increased. <p> The duration of the test presentation is minimized so that it will not affect the magnitude of the TAE significantly. When the time course of the direct TAE is measured in this way for human subjects, the increase is approximately logarithmic with time <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>, as is evident 64 the average TAE in the RF-LISSOM model from figure 5.2 with a different amount of adaptation. The same basic S-shaped curve is seen regardless of the duration of adaptation, but the magnitude increases monotonically with adaptation. for the model in figure 5.9. <p> Null at training angle: Adaptation does not change the perceived orientation of the stimulus used during adaptation (figure 5.2; <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>. Direct effect: Similar orientations are misperceived by human subjects as having a larger difference than they actually do (Gibson and Radner 1937), peaking between 5 ffi and 20 ffi , typically 10 ffi - 13 ffi (Howard and Templeton 1966, p.216; Campbell and Maffei 1971; Mitchell and <p> Null at training angle: Adaptation does not change the perceived orientation of the stimulus used during adaptation (figure 5.2; <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>. Direct effect: Similar orientations are misperceived by human subjects as having a larger difference than they actually do (Gibson and Radner 1937), peaking between 5 ffi and 20 ffi , typically 10 ffi - 13 ffi (Howard and Templeton 1966, p.216; Campbell and Maffei 1971; Mitchell and Muir 1976). <p> Zero-crossings between 30 ffi and 60 ffi have been observed in RF-LISSOM; 45 ffi is typical (figure 5.2). Indirect effect: Distant orientations are misperceived as having a smaller difference than they actually do <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>, peaking somewhere between 60 ffi and 85 ffi (Muir and Over 1970; Campbell and Maffei 1971; Mitchell and Muir 1976). In RF-LISSOM, indirect effect peaks between 45 ffi and 75 ffi have been observed; 60 ffi is typical. <p> This discrepancy has been satisfactorily explained as a methodological problem of the earlier studies, and the assumption of orientation independence now seems well established. Spatial localization: The TAE is localized to the area of the retina which was trained <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>. Adaptation for a figure in one location has no measurable effect on test figures in other locations sufficiently distant. <p> However, as described in section 2.3.4, no consensus has emerged about the cause of the indirect TAE. Over the years, it has been proposed to result from a "linkage" between the vertical and horizontal axes <ref> (Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref>, adaptation of cells with multiple preferred orientations (Coltheart 1971), a three-lobed lateral interaction profile (O'Toole and Wenderoth 1977), and direct effects arising from an invisible "virtual axis" of symmetry (Wenderoth et al. 1989).

Reference-contexts: At a given location on the cortical sheet, the neurons in a vertical section through the cortex generally have the same preference for the eye of origin, stimulus orientation, stimulus size, etc. It is customary to refer to such a section as a column <ref> (Gilbert and Wiesel 1989) </ref>. The RF-LISSOM model discussed in this thesis will treat each column as a single unit, thus representing the cortex as a purely two-dimensional surface.

Reference-contexts: To show how the orientation preferences are located across the network, an orientation map was computed by labeling each neuron with its orientation preference, as determined from its afferent weights. The afferent weights were fitted to an ellipsoidal Gaussian (equation 4.1) using the nonlinear programming package NPSOL <ref> (Gill et al. 1986) </ref>. The orientation of the fitted function was taken to be the orientation preference of that neuron; it is the orientation of the Gaussian that maximally excites the afferent weights.

Reference-contexts: This has been demonstrated conclusively at the cellular level in tissue slices <ref> (Hirsch and Gilbert 1991) </ref>, and more recently in vivo at the level of cortical columns (Weliky and Kandler 1995). As discussed below, it has been hypothesized that these complex connections help enhance the ability to detect low-contrast inputs while suppressing redundant activation for high-contrast inputs. <p> Miller and MacKay (1994) showed that doing so would result in a set of strictly binary connections, each either at full strength or zero strength. Such subtractive normalization seems implausible given that a variety of lateral connection strengths are found in the cortex <ref> (Hirsch and Gilbert 1991, 1993) </ref>. The multiplicative normalization used in RF-LISSOM (equation 3.4) results in each of the other connections being scaled down in proportion to its current strength. Multiplicative normalization preserves a variety of connection strengths.

Reference-contexts: The effect resembles an afterimage from staring at a bright light, but it causes changes in orientation perception rather than color or brightness perception. In general, the visual system provides an accurate means of measuring the orientation of visual contours such as lines and edges <ref> (see Howard and Templeton 1966, p.179-183 for a review) </ref>. However, contours presented close together or one after the other in the same location can interact, causing distortions in their apparent orientations. <p> This is generally considered unreliable since most subjects are poor judges of angles other than vertical and horizontal relative to the retina (Mansfield 1974; Mitchell and Muir 1976). Setting the figure to apparent vertical. This can be done with accuracy within a de gree by most unadapted subjects <ref> (Howard and Templeton 1966, p.179) </ref>. Setting a comparison figure parallel to the test figure. This can be done with fairly high consistency, although it is not necessarily an accurate measure of the actual orientation. It is particularly useful because it can measure the effect for oblique testing angles. <p> The direct effect consists of a perceived expansion of small angles, i.e. the positive half of the `S' in figure 2.5. A maximum overestimation of a few degrees is experienced at an angular separation between 5 ffi and 20 ffi <ref> (Howard and Templeton 1966, p.216) </ref>. Larger angles begin to show less of an after 9 of the perceived orientation of that line after adaptation on the other; the effects are equal in both directions marked (Mitchell and Muir 1976). <p> direct and indirect effects varies significantly from 45 ffi , over a range of 25 ffi to 50 ffi (Campbell and Maffei 1971; Mitchell and Muir 1976; Muir and Over 1970). 2.3.2 Satiation Later researchers were unsatisfied with the clearly ad hoc explanation of Gibson's normalization theory, and proposed alternatives <ref> (see Howard and Templeton 1966 for a review) </ref>. 11 One of the most prominent theories (Kohler and Wallach 1944) postulated that the TAE is an example of a larger class of figural aftereffects. <p> Development of maps for the other visual dimensions has not yet been modeled in RF-LISSOM, so testing their aftereffects will have to wait until the maps have been studied. Analogous aftereffects have also been found for other modalities such as hearing, touch, muscle positioning, and posture <ref> (Howard and Templeton 1966, p.84-85,p.162-163) </ref>. 86 For instance, hearing a sound in one location can influence the perceived location of later sounds.

Reference-contexts: Sutherland (1961) proposed such an explanation originally, and Coltheart (1971) extended it to account for indirect effects. Coltheart noted that some neurons (here called cross-neurons) had been discovered that had two preferred orientations, each orthogonal to the other <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1965, 1968) </ref>. While an adaptation figure is being shown, some cross-neurons (i.e., those having one of their axes matching the figure) would desensitize in the same way as the simpler neurons whose orientation preference matched.

Reference-contexts: Muir and Over (1970) proposed an alternative theory of indirect effects within this framework. It had been observed that when an oriented figure is presented, neurons with orientation preferences orthogonal to that of the figure actually have less activity than their resting level <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1967) </ref>. Muir and Over (1970) proposed that these neurons would not only not be fatigued after adaptation, they would be actively facilitated, i.e. somehow become more susceptible to future stimulation.

Reference-contexts: The inhibitory connection strengths between activated neurons are believed to increase temporarily while the subject focuses on an input pattern, causing changes in the perception of subsequent orientations. This occurs because the detectors are broadly tuned, and detectors for neighboring orientations also adapt somewhat <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1968) </ref>. When a subsequent line of a slightly different orientation is presented, the most strongly responding units are now the ones with orientation preferences further from the adapting line, resulting in a change in the angle perceived. <p> Neurons in the LGN behave similarly (Casagrande and Norton 1989). Beginning in the primary visual cortex, most neurons are found instead to prefer inputs elongated in some particular direction <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1968) </ref>. Such neurons respond most strongly to an oriented stimulus such as a line or an edge close to a preferred orientation.

Reference-contexts: This approach would help minimize the time spent in learning, yet allow the environment to have some influence on the structures developed. 29 Once the developing systems are nearly complete, it would be desirable to limit their adaptability. Otherwise, eventually all traces of the initial genetic order would disappear <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. Allowing the organism to significantly adapt further would thus amount to ignoring valuable information from the genome (as described in the previous section). <p> Neural mechanisms to generate coherent patterns are well-documented in a number of different systems (Marder and Cal-abrese 1996). Such a pattern generator would allow genetic factors to be expressed through the same mechanisms also used later when adapting to the visual environment <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. As simulations with RF-LISSOM have demonstrated, even very simple patterns can drive the development of extraordinarily complex structures, such as the orientation map in V1 (described in chapter 4). <p> Since the specification for the pattern generator could be encoded into a very small amount of genetic information <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>, very different structures could be specified by changing only a small part of the genome. Random mutations in that portion of the genetic code would be likely to cause development of slightly different patterns, which might lead to quite different cortical structures. <p> Furthermore, birds and mammals, which are much more adaptable to different environments than other animals, are the only organisms known to exhibit REM sleep in the adult <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. During and just before REM sleep, internally generated phasic waves called ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves can be measured in the LGN, V1, and many other cortical areas (Jouvet 1980; Steriade et al. 1989). <p> These apparently genetically-programmed waves consist of large, slow increases in field potential when measured with an EEG (electroencephalogram). They appear to cause specific eye movements which have been statistically correlated with reports of the direction of gaze in dream imagery <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. PGO waves originate in the pons of the brain stem (hence ponto-) and travel via direct pathways to the lateral geniculate nucleus (hence -geniculo) and to visual cortex (in the occipital lobe, hence -occipital; Steriade et al. 1989). <p> They appear to be relayed from the LGN and visual cortex to many other areas of the cortex <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. Jouvet (1980) has proposed that these waves help direct the course of brain maturation in early life, and specifically that they allow genetic differences among individuals to be expressed. <p> Unlike the retinal waves discussed in the previous section, PGO waves are correlated between the two eyes. The patterns sent to each of the eye-specific layers of the LGN are generated separately, but match quite closely <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. The correlation presumably represents the pattern of similar, but not identical, eye movement directions for the two eyes. This type of correlated input would ordinarily counteract the imbalance of inputs from the deprived and non-deprived eyes. <p> Thus the PGO waves may also serve to limit such unwarranted adaptation. Since adults exhibit significant amounts of REM sleep as well, these pattern generators may also be operating in the developed animal <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. They may help maintain a balance between specific visual correlations 35 learned during the day, such as a preponderance of certain orientations of lines, and circuitry capable of handling a wide variety of processing tasks, such as detecting all possible lines. <p> For instance, both behavioral and pharmacological methods of REM deprivation cause significant stress, and the pharmacological methods involve drugs that are not particularly specific in their actions <ref> (Jouvet 1980) </ref>. This makes REM sleep results difficult to interpret. The PGO waves themselves are well-documented, however, and since they occur in many different areas of the brain, they could represent a general feature of mammalian neural systems.

Reference-contexts: Internally generated patterns may help to explain how evolution leapt over the gaps between successive species in phylogeny. This interpretation is supported by the observation that learning mechanisms appear to be highly conserved between species and brain areas in mammals <ref> (Kirkwood and Bear 1994) </ref>, while presumably pattern generators would vary significantly between different species. The patterns of fur coloring on different individuals of the same species, e.g. domestic cats, might represent a graphic example of internal pattern generation in development.

Reference-contexts: These waves may represent training inputs for the prenatally developing LGN and cortex, providing a simple explanation of how the system could be activity-dependent, yet already organized at birth. The waves begin before photoreceptors have even developed <ref> (Maffei and Galli-Resta 1990) </ref>, so they do not result from visual input of any sort. They are presumably entirely unsynchronized between the two eyes, since they occur spontaneously and locally, with long pauses in between (Shatz 1990).

Reference-contexts: In any case, the decay does not appear to rely on visual input, since it has the same time course whether the subject is in complete darkness, or if test patterns are presented at intervals during decay <ref> (Magnussen and Johnsen 1986) </ref>. In the RF-LISSOM model, decay will occur in the same way as adaptation occurs | subsequent inputs will cause the organization to return to equilibrium as long as they include orientations different from the fixation stimulus (cf. Wolfe 1984).

Reference-contexts: by local application of the excitatory transmitter glutamate (Vidyasagar 1990), indicating that firing is not sufficient to cause adaptation. * Adaptation to two orientations simultaneously, each of which would cause adaptation separately, can actually reduce the amount of the TAE, rather than increase it as the fatigue theory would predict <ref> (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980a) </ref>. This effect is known as disinhibition, and is also discussed in section 2.3.4. <p> The inhibition theory also correctly accounts for the phenomenon of disinhibition documented for the tilt illusion (Carpenter and Blakemore 1973) and the tilt aftereffect 13 <ref> (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980a) </ref>. This phenomenon arises for the TAE when multiple adaptation figures with different orientations are presented simultaneously. <p> This result follows simply from having more detectors activated, and thus more detectors fatigued. However, such adaptation actually reduces the amount of the TAE <ref> (Magnussen and Kurtenbach 1980a) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This type of adaptation has also been observed in kittens raised in deprived visual environments (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975). Such an anisotropic distribution is probably typical of the early visual experience of humans <ref> (Mansfield 1974) </ref>. Frequency localization: The TAE is selective for spatial frequency (Ware and Mitchell 1974); adapting to a figure with narrow bars has no measurable effect upon a figure with wide bars, and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: This type of correlated input would ordinarily counteract the imbalance of inputs from the deprived and non-deprived eyes. Thus the monocular deprivation protocol should have had greater effect in the absence of PGO waves, which was in fact seen <ref> (Marks et al. 1995) </ref>. Jouvet (1980) speculates that PGO waves are a very general signal that activates local circuits in each brain area. Each local circuits would then generate training inputs appropriate for its area.

Reference-contexts: Larger angles begin to show less of an after 9 of the perceived orientation of that line after adaptation on the other; the effects are equal in both directions marked <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. The direct effect (left) consists of a perceived expansion of small angles, such as the one shown. The indirect effect (center) consists of a perceived contraction of larger angles. <p> that although subjects do not spontaneously report any difference in the perceived orientation of an oblique line (i.e., neither horizontal nor vertical) after adaptation, when asked to set a comparison line parallel to the test line they make systematic errors identical to those made on vertical or horizontal test lines <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. The variance of the settings was significantly larger for the oblique case, which contributed to the difficulty of establishing the effect for oblique lines. <p> More recent experiments have shown that this assumption is invalid, since similar effects occur regardless of the adaptation angle <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. Another likely consequence is that tilt effects should be zero at precisely 45 ffi (the midpoint between the two axes), as Gibson and Radner (1937) found for their subjects and setup. <p> This alternative procedure is computationally prohibitive to simulate (not to mention extraordinarily time-consuming to measure in humans) because one must ensure that the cortex has returned to equilibrium between the adaptation episodes. Since the angular function of the tilt aftereffect has been demonstrated to be similar for all orientations <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>, the two procedures should give an equivalent measure of the amount of aftereffect at each angle. The procedure used here allows much more comprehensive data to be collected for the model, as shown in section 5.5. <p> However, since the data are generally too erratic to interpret from a single run, multiple runs from a single individual are usually averaged <ref> (e.g. Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. To obtain similar measurements for the RF-LISSOM model, a single orientation map was tested separately at 9 different positions forming a 3 fi 3 grid covering a retinal area 6 fi 6 units around the center of the retina (figure 5.1). <p> Figure 5.2 plots the aftereffects after adaptation for 90 iterations of the RF-LISSOM algorithm. For comparison, figure 5.2 also shows the most detailed data available for the TAE in human foveal vision <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. The results from the RF-LISSOM simulation are strikingly similar to the psychophysical results. For the range 5 ffi to 40 ffi , all subjects in the human study (including the one shown) exhibited angle repulsion effects nearly identical to those found in the RF-LISSOM model. <p> Orientation-independence: The TAE versus angle curve is similar for all pairs of test and adaptation angles which differ by the same amount, regardless of the absolute orientation on the retina <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. Conflicting results were found by previous researchers, who could not demonstrate effects on oblique lines of adaptation to vertical lines. This discrepancy has been satisfactorily explained as a methodological problem of the earlier studies, and the assumption of orientation independence now seems well established. <p> When sufficient computing power is available and the model is extended as described, RF-LISSOM is expected to account for these experimental observations as well: Higher variance at oblique orientations: The TAE versus angle curve shows greater variance for oblique testing orientations <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>, often sufficiently high to entirely mask the effect (Campbell and Maffei 1971). The variance may result from the smaller number of detectors in the fovea subserving angles that are neither horizontal nor vertical (Bauer et al. 1991; Mansfield 1974). <p> The linkage explanation was disproved by the finding that indirect and direct effects are similar at all absolute orientations <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. <p> Assumption 1 appears to be valid for humans, who show similar effects at all angles <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. It must be true in the RF-LISSOM as well, because the model has no preferred direction. That is, the choice of which orientation to call "vertical" in the model is arbitrary.

Reference-contexts: Blocking the activity in the retina, but substituting certain patterns of artificial electrical stimulation, results in dramatically different cellular properties than if other patterns are used <ref> (Mooney et al. 1993) </ref>. This suggests that the patterns of electrical activity are the important feature of the waves (Shatz 1990, 1996). As the waves subside gradually in strength and frequency due to developmental processes in the retina, the connectivity in the LGN stabilizes (Wong et al.1993).

Reference-contexts: The branches form a local cluster of connections to other cells in the region. Such clusters occur only in regions with similar functional properties as the parent cell. Adapted from Gilbert and Wiesel (1989). easily modified <ref> (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981) </ref>. <p> Mammals, being quite complex and capable of handling a wide variety of different environments, appear to represent a particularly successful balance of these developmental and evolutionary constraints. Although significant genetic components are present, an extensive array of early environmental influences on visual system development have been documented in mammals <ref> (for review see Movshon and van Sluyters 1981) </ref>. The following sections will argue that mammals make use of a simple technique that allows them to make use of both environmental and genetic information efficiently. <p> Manipulations of the visual environment have been shown to have dramatic effects on the organization of the visual cortex <ref> (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981) </ref>, the next step in the visual pathway. Thus internally-generated retinal waves appear to be instrumental in pre-visual development, at least of the LGN, and they appear to play a role similar to that which visual input plays for higher areas. <p> Ordinarily, blocking signals from one eye of a kitten for even a few days during the critical period for visual development (4-6 weeks after birth) causes dramatic strengthening of connections to visual cortex from the non-deprived eye, and a loss of connections from the deprived eye <ref> (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981) </ref>. With shorter deprivation times, the effects are less pronounced. If both eyes are deprived of input, no detectable loss or strengthening 34 occurs (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981). <p> birth) causes dramatic strengthening of connections to visual cortex from the non-deprived eye, and a loss of connections from the deprived eye <ref> (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981) </ref>. With shorter deprivation times, the effects are less pronounced. If both eyes are deprived of input, no detectable loss or strengthening 34 occurs (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981). Thus the monocular deprivation paradigm offers an opportunity to test the role of environmental and genetic factors in development, both of which appear to be operating in this system. Marks et al. (1995) blocked signals from one eye for a portion of the critical period. <p> If the afferent weights are modifiable in RF-LISSOM, the layout of the orientation map itself can undergo substantial reorganization. Areas representing the orientation used during adaptation increase in size, while those representing other orientations decrease. Such changes are known to occur in response to ordinary visual experience during development <ref> (Movshon and van Sluyters 1981) </ref>. In the adult, however, they are thought to require cortical lesions or very long-term changes in visual input (Gilbert et al. 1996; Kapadia et al. 1994; Sugita 1996; see also Miikkulainen et al. 1997; Sirosh et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: However, there are numerous differences between masking and the TAE. For instance, there doesn't appear to be any facilitation observed for very distant orientations, yet the TAE shows an indirect effect for those orientations <ref> (Over et al. 1972) </ref>. In addition, masking persists in the presence of inhibitory receptor blockade (Vidyasagar 1990) that would be expected to prevent the TAE (see section 6.3). The differences may provide clues about how the contrast-dependent lateral interactions are implemented.

Reference-contexts: of curves in figure 5.9, but limited tests of this nature should be computationally feasible. 6.4.3 Contrast effects When both the adapting and test gratings have the same contrast, and test stimuli are presented for a relatively long period, the magnitude of the TAE does not depend upon the contrast <ref> (Parker 1972) </ref>. However, in any other circumstance, the absolute and relative contrasts systematically affect the magnitude of the TAE (Harris and Calvert 1989; Parker 1972; Ross et al. 1993, 1996). <p> For instance, with long presentation times, a larger TAE will be seen for a low-contrast test grating than for one which has high contrast. Similarly, a low-contrast adaptation pattern will cause a smaller TAE for a high-contrast test-grating <ref> (Parker 1972) </ref>. Such effects may be a straightforward consequence of the activity-dependent adaptation modeled in RF-LISSOM. Larger adaptation will occur for higher-contrast inputs, but adaptation will also occur if the test inputs have high contrast, so the effects may cancel out.

Without inhibition, the sign of the TAE should be reversed and it should have a smaller magnitude (perhaps not even being measurable, if afferent plasticity is insignificant). Adaptation under those conditions should result in the afferent-only effects shown in figure 5.3.

Reference-contexts: Different organisms appear to use these sources of information in very different ways, appropriate to their ecological niches and overall degree of complexity. For instance, an animal's development could be specified in precise detail by its genome <ref> (Purves 1988) </ref>. This would be feasible if the important factors of an animal's environment remain essentially constant for millennia, and if the adult animal is not particularly complex. <p> Thus the genetic developmental mechanisms must express many highly repetitive structures or they must specify the structures only approximately (Purves 1988; Shatz 1996). Secondly, even during embryonic stages, the developmental process appears quite flexible <ref> (Purves 1988) </ref>. Developing organisms adapt systematically to a number of rather drastic modifications, such as the implantation of a third eye in a frog (Reh and Constantine-Paton 1985) or the removal of large areas of the brain of a primate (Goldman-Rakic 1980). <p> These adaptations presumably arise out of a repertoire of possible responses to damage or malfunction in the developing embryo. The embryonic adaptive mechanisms would be even more important for mammals than for simpler creatures, since greater complexity increases the likelihood of isolated malfunctions <ref> (Purves 1988) </ref>. Thus if each connection were hardwired, an explosive number of backup connections would need to be specified as well, or else some general adaptation procedure would be needed (Shatz 1996). If there were such a general procedure, then the initial precise specification would be superfluous anyway. <p> Any single change would be likely to damage the nervous system, yet an enormous number of coordinated changes would be needed to transform a fully-specific mouse genome into a fully-specific monkey genome <ref> (Purves 1988) </ref>. But even though much of the DNA is shared between mammalian species, an extraordinary variety of mammals exist, with quite different cortical organizations (Purves 1988). Internally generated patterns may help to explain how evolution leapt over the gaps between successive species in phylogeny. <p> damage the nervous system, yet an enormous number of coordinated changes would be needed to transform a fully-specific mouse genome into a fully-specific monkey genome <ref> (Purves 1988) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Methods like PET (positron emission tomography) which require integration over long time periods would be unsuitable <ref> (Sejnowski and Churchland 1989) </ref>. Next, the cortex would be adapted to a stimulus of a particular orientation. Finally, the test patterns would be presented again, measuring the cortical response once more.

Reference-contexts: The waves begin before photoreceptors have even developed (Maffei and Galli-Resta 1990), so they do not result from visual input of any sort. They are presumably entirely unsynchronized between the two eyes, since they occur spontaneously and locally, with long pauses in between <ref> (Shatz 1990) </ref>. Blocking this activity in the retina prevents the segregation of the LGN into eye-specific layers before birth (Shatz 1990, 1996), so the activity must be playing a role in the segregation. <p> They are presumably entirely unsynchronized between the two eyes, since they occur spontaneously and locally, with long pauses in between (Shatz 1990). Blocking this activity in the retina prevents the segregation of the LGN into eye-specific layers before birth <ref> (Shatz 1990, 1996) </ref>, so the activity must be playing a role in the segregation. Blocking the activity in the retina, but substituting certain patterns of artificial electrical stimulation, results in dramatically different cellular properties than if other patterns are used (Mooney et al. 1993). <p> Blocking the activity in the retina, but substituting certain patterns of artificial electrical stimulation, results in dramatically different cellular properties than if other patterns are used (Mooney et al. 1993). This suggests that the patterns of electrical activity are the important feature of the waves <ref> (Shatz 1990, 1996) </ref>. As the waves subside gradually in strength and frequency due to developmental processes in the retina, the connectivity in the LGN stabilizes (Wong et al.1993). <p> Such activity may be a general feature of the earliest sensory areas in more complex organisms such as birds and mammals, allowing genetic factors to be take effect via the same mechanisms which later incorporate environmental influences <ref> (Shatz 1990) </ref>. This would represent a developmental mechanism which is quite efficient and effective on a number of different levels, as described above. PGO waves Internal pattern generation may continue at somewhat reduced levels, even after development.

Reference-contexts: Thus if each connection were hardwired, an explosive number of backup connections would need to be specified as well, or else some general adaptation procedure would be needed <ref> (Shatz 1996) </ref>. If there were such a general procedure, then the initial precise specification would be superfluous anyway. Finally, evolution seems unlikely to have developed such a wastefully modular system, with two complex and non-overlapping systems to perform similar tasks. <p> Otherwise, the system would not be 30 able to accept subsequent cues from the environment. Instead of such a clean separation between genetic and environmental factors, it seems more likely that the initial mechanisms or structures are reused to some extent in later activity-dependent developmental processes <ref> (Shatz 1996) </ref>. Cumulatively, the above constraints strongly discourage large-scale fully-specific hardwiring, yet somehow most organisms (including humans) develop with a large degree of structure already present at birth (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975).

Reference-contexts: However, it remains unclear how exactly this contrast dependence is implemented in the cortex. An early proposal was that the inhibitory interneurons are inherently more effective than the direct excitatory connections, but have a higher threshold for activation <ref> (Sillito 1979) </ref>. At very low stimulus levels, the excitatory effects would predominate, but at high levels the inhibitory interneurons would become progressively more active and eventually would suppress the response of the target cell. <p> If this is found to be the case, it would represent strong support for the lateral inhibition theory of direct and indirect tilt aftereffects. A further test of the model could be made by blocking intracortical inhibition me 80 diated by GABA B receptors with bicuculline <ref> (Sillito 1979) </ref> and that mediated by GABA A receptors with phaclofen (Pfleger and Bonds 1995). Without inhibition, the sign of the TAE should be reversed and it should have a smaller magnitude (perhaps not even being measurable, if afferent plasticity is insignificant).

Reference-contexts: Thus V1 neurons are considered detectors for their preferred orientation, and neural explanations of orientation perception usually begin at this level of processing. Higher visual processing areas in the brain all use the output from this stage, eventually detecting more complex features such as human faces <ref> (Van Essen et al. 1992) </ref>. The primary visual cortex, like the other parts of the cortex, is composed of a two-dimensional, slightly folded sheet of neurons and connections between them. If flattened, human V1 would cover an area of nearly four square inches (Wandell 1995).

Note that blocking the inhibitory receptors does not necessarily prevent inhibitory adaptation <ref> (Vidyasagar 1990) </ref>, since changes could still occur in the excitatory connections to inhibitory interneurons. However, the functional consequences of inhibitory adaptation would no longer be apparent. It is not possible to perform such tests in humans, since the chemicals disrupt brain function. <p> However, there are numerous differences between masking and the TAE. For instance, there doesn't appear to be any facilitation observed for very distant orientations, yet the TAE shows an indirect effect for those orientations (Over et al. 1972). In addition, masking persists in the presence of inhibitory receptor blockade <ref> (Vidyasagar 1990) </ref> that would be expected to prevent the TAE (see section 6.3). The differences may provide clues about how the contrast-dependent lateral interactions are implemented.

Reference-contexts: It is spatially localized on the retina (Gibson and Radner 1937); adaptation for a figure in one location has no measurable effect on test figures in other locations sufficiently distant. It is spatially selective for frequency <ref> (Ware and Mitchell 1974) </ref>; adapting on a figure with narrow bars has no measurable effect upon a figure with wide bars, and vice versa. <p> This type of adaptation has also been observed in kittens raised in deprived visual environments (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975). Such an anisotropic distribution is probably typical of the early visual experience of humans (Mansfield 1974). Frequency localization: The TAE is selective for spatial frequency <ref> (Ware and Mitchell 1974) </ref>; adapting to a figure with narrow bars has no measurable effect upon a figure with wide bars, and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: All of the long-range lateral connections in the RF-LISSOM model are inhibitory, as has been found to be required to produce self-organization (Sirosh 1995). However, a consensus appears to be emerging that they cannot always be considered strictly excitatory or inhibitory, but instead have different effects in different circumstances <ref> (Weliky and Kandler 1995) </ref>. Anatomical surveys show that 80% of the synapses of long-range lateral connections connect directly between pyramidal cells, which are thought to make excitatory synapses only (Gilbert et al. 1990; McGuire et al. 1991). <p> This has been demonstrated conclusively at the cellular level in tissue slices (Hirsch and Gilbert 1991), and more recently in vivo at the level of cortical columns <ref> (Weliky and Kandler 1995) </ref>. As discussed below, it has been hypothesized that these complex connections help enhance the ability to detect low-contrast inputs while suppressing redundant activation for high-contrast inputs. However, it remains unclear how exactly this contrast dependence is implemented in the cortex.

Reference-contexts: The smaller magnitude of the indirect effects would presumably result from the lower perceptual saliency of virtual axes (Wenderoth et al. 1989). Other differences between the indirect and direct effects have been found in a long series of experiments <ref> (Wenderoth and Johnstone 1988, 1989) </ref>, most of which indicate that indirect effects develop later in time than the direct effects. <p> Thus if those neurons represent the virtual axis, they would have to be inherently slower to activate than other V1 neurons, since the indirect effects have been shown to have a later onset <ref> (Wenderoth and Johnstone 1988, 1989) </ref>. Yet De Valois et al. (1982) found no significant differences in the time behavior of cross-neurons relative to other V1 neurons, so these neurons must not represent the substrate for the virtual axis. <p> The O'Toole and Wen-deroth (1977) theory (i.e., inhibition at intermediate distances, but excitation at near and far distances) was abandoned by at least some of its original proponents when they found that the indirect effect arises significantly later than the direct effect <ref> (Wenderoth and John-stone 1988, 1989) </ref>. If both effects result from very similar processes of lateral interactions, differing only in sign, one would have expected them to have a fairly similar time course as well. <p> For instance, the total synaptic resources might not all be in use initially, so there could conceivably be a small delay before synaptic resource conservation would cause indirect effects. This delay could account for the findings that the indirect effect has a later onset than the direct effect <ref> (Wenderoth and Johnstone 1988, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus direct effects would result (as described above) from repulsion from the actual line, and indirect effects would result from repulsion from the virtual axis. The smaller magnitude of the indirect effects would presumably result from the lower perceptual saliency of virtual axes <ref> (Wenderoth et al. 1989) </ref>. Other differences between the indirect and direct effects have been found in a long series of experiments (Wenderoth and Johnstone 1988, 1989), most of which indicate that indirect effects develop later in time than the direct effects. <p> the years, it has been proposed to result from a "linkage" between the vertical and horizontal axes (Gibson and Radner 1937), adaptation of cells with multiple preferred orientations (Coltheart 1971), a three-lobed lateral interaction profile (O'Toole and Wenderoth 1977), and direct effects arising from an invisible "virtual axis" of symmetry <ref> (Wenderoth et al. 1989) </ref>. The linkage explanation was disproved by the finding that indirect and direct effects are similar at all absolute orientations (Mitchell and Muir 1976).

Reference-contexts: In the RF-LISSOM model, decay will occur in the same way as adaptation occurs | subsequent inputs will cause the organization to return to equilibrium as long as they include orientations different from the fixation stimulus <ref> (cf. Wolfe 1984) </ref>. However, if no inputs are presented (or, equivalently, blank inputs are presented), no weight changes will occur, and the tilt aftereffects will remain indefinitely. <p> In humans, large aftereffects (greater than 5 ffi ) have been found for very short test presentations <ref> (Wolfe 1984) </ref>. With the tests above it might be possible to decide whether 83 different mechanisms are operating over these short time scales (Harris and Calvert 1989; Wolfe 1984), or whether the effect of the test pattern is sufficient to explain the larger aftereffect found in those circumstances.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the patterns of electrical activity are the important feature of the waves (Shatz 1990, 1996). As the waves subside gradually in strength and frequency due to developmental processes in the retina, the connectivity in the LGN stabilizes <ref> (Wong et al.1993) </ref>. At approximately the same time, visual input becomes functional, but it is not yet known whether visual input causes the waves to cease or whether they cease in anticipation of visual input.
