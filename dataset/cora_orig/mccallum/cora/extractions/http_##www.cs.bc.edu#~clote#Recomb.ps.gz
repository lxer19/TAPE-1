Reference-contexts: The latter is directly related to the expected Levenshtein distance d (u; v) between u; v, since for length n sequences, it is the case that d (u; v) = 2 (n `(u; v)). In <ref> [1] </ref>, L. Adleman very cleverly indicated how genetic techniques in a wet lab could be used to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: Our model provides us with certain interesting, highly nontrivial open problems, whose solution might help us to better understand phylogeny, genetic distance between species, and whether evolution displays chaotic behavior, in the sense of mathematical dynamics. Our work is somewhat related to that of Chvatal and Sankoff <ref> [3] </ref>, concerning the expected length `(u; v) of the longest common subsequence of two random sequences u; v of length n. <p> This latter problem seems to be related to the earlier cited work of Chvatal-Sankoff <ref> [3] </ref>, and appears to be quite difficult, as illustrated by the following example furnished by J. Sgall (personal communication). Let x be the empty word, K 1 = f01g and K 2 = f00g.
