Abstract: The majority of real-world probabilistic systems are used by more than one user, thus a utility model must be elicited separately for each new user. Utility elicitation is long and tedious, particularly if the outcome space is large and not decomposable. Most research on utility elicitation focuses on making assumptions about the decomposability of the utility function. Here we make no assumptions about the decomposability of the utility function; rather we attempt to cluster a database of existing user utility functions into a small number of prototypical utility functions. Having identified these prototypes, we can then effectively classify a new user's utility function by asking many fewer and simpler assessments than full utility model elicitation would require.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we will assume that the utility functions in our database have been normalized. In the PANDA 2 The problem is non-trivial. In a recent paper Druzdzel <ref> [ Druzdzel, 1997 ] </ref> pointed out the importance of a fixed zero point in explaining the recommendations of probabilistic systems.

In many cases, however, attributes are highly correlated and thus assumptions of decomposability are suspect. If we incorrectly assume decomposability, the true utility function may differ significantly, and thus our assumption will adversely affect the choice of strategy.

Reference-contexts: by a single reference point (we will call these points prototypes), which may be a particular instance in the cluster (as in the k-mediods algorithm [ Vinod, 1969 ] ), or some constructed exemplar, for example the mean of the points in the cluster (as in the popular k-means algorithm <ref> [ MacQueen, 1967 ] </ref> ). The algorithm starts by picking a set P of k prototypes at random. Next we assign each data point to the closest prototype. Once we have our new clusters, we choose a new prototype for each cluster according to some scoring criteria.

Reference-contexts: The outcome o 2 can then be assigned the value U (o 1 ) + (1 )U (o 3 ). The utility function was shown by von Neumann and Morgenstern <ref> [ Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947 ] </ref> to be uniquely determined up to an increasing linear transformation, i.e., for any utility function U (O) and constants a and b, such that a &gt; 0, aU (O) + b is also a utility function encoding the same preferences.

Reference-contexts: return to the term "more similar" shortly.) When a dataset is clustered, every point is assigned to some cluster, and every cluster can be characterized by a single reference point (we will call these points prototypes), which may be a particular instance in the cluster (as in the k-mediods algorithm <ref> [ Vinod, 1969 ] </ref> ), or some constructed exemplar, for example the mean of the points in the cluster (as in the popular k-means algorithm [ MacQueen, 1967 ] ).
