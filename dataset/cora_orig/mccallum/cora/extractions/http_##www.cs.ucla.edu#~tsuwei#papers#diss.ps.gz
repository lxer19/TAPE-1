Reference-contexts: Fourth, for each VC, the application provides a callback routine which is used by the QoS manager to provide feedback as part of renegotiation. The QoS scheme described above is successfully implemented in a wireless ATM 60 network: SWAN <ref> [Agr96] </ref>, developed in the Lucent Bell Laboratories. 5.2 The SWAN Environment The SWAN (Seamless Wireless ATM Network) system, shown in Fig. 5.2, is a testbed for wireless networked computing. SWAN consists of mobile units which are usually laptops, and base stations which are connected to a backbone network [Goo90].

Reference-contexts: The advantages of DBF are its simplicity and computation efficiency due to its distributed characteristic. However, it is well known that DBF is slow to converge when topology change, and has the tendency to create routing loops, especially when the link conditions are not stable <ref> [BG87] </ref>. <p> An example is shown in Fig. 2.2. The discussion of looping problem can also be found in <ref> [BG87] </ref>. Partial remedies like split-horizon and poisoned-reverse were developed and used in wired network protocol like RIP [Hed88].

Reference-contexts: As a result, adverse traffic conditions can cause significant degradation in the quality of a multimedia stream in environments like Internet or wireless networks, where packet loss can be large and packet delivery time cannot be guaranteed. As reported in <ref> [BV98] </ref>, the perceived audio quality drops sharply as packet loss reaches 20% for non-adaptive applications even if packet retransmission techniques are used to replace lost packets. Hence, applications operating in such environments must be able to dynamically adjust the characteristics of the multimedia stream to the changing network conditions.

Reference-contexts: Thus a whole path starting from node S, than node 2, than node 1, than node D, is computed. 2.5 On-demand Routing Besides DBF, On-demand routing, also known as diffusion computation (DC) is another scheme used for routing in wireless network, such as the Lightweight Mobile Routing (LMR) protocol <ref> [CE95] </ref> and Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithms (TORA) [PC97]. In the on-demand routing scheme, a node builds up a route by flooding a query to all nodes in the network. The query packet picks up the IDs of the intermediate 14 nodes and stores them in a path field. <p> If the alternate path does not exist, DBF cannot detect it until the hop count for that node is iterated to the value of infinity, which can be as large as N . 3.4 Performance Analysis Unlike in <ref> [MG95, PB94, CE95, PC97] </ref>, where a wireless network is simulated by a static network with higher link failure rate, we used a truly mobile environment in our simulator to determine the connectivity among mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: In particularly, for multicas-ting within the wireless network, a novel scheme, inspired to CBT (Core Based Trees), was been developed, which relies on QoS routing and exploits the cluster structure of the network <ref> [CG] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If the QoS reporting functions were incorporated into the network layer (as proposed, for instance, in <ref> [Che97] </ref>), the Network Monitor would be able to obtain b/w information directly from the OS. In this case, there would be no need for QoS Emulator and the value for the available bandwidth will be based on actual measurements.

Reference-contexts: The playback takes place in real-time except for the initial buffering delay. The characteristic feature of this audio-on-demand application is its ability to dynamically adapt the characteristics of the audio stream to changing network QoS. Our application follows the principles of Application Level Framing (ALF) <ref> [CT90] </ref>, which 84 advocates closer cooperation between functions traditionally associated with network and application layers. This way, the application can take advantage of the QoS parameter information provided by the network to adapt to changes in network's behavior [Du 97].

Reference-contexts: While the first two are determined by monitoring the actual packet stream, the third parameter is not computed but is provided by the user. In the future, available bandwidth can be provided by QoS routing <ref> [CTG97] </ref>. The reason for the available b/w information being emulated, rather than being 89 measured like the rest of QoS parameters is because the network layer currently lacks the facilities necessary to provide such information.

Reference-contexts: This virtual channel can be manipulated to produce different levels of packet loss according to user specifications through the QoS manipulator. The wireless testbed, on the other hand, consists of Lucent WaveLANs with mul-tihop routing implementation <ref> [Fer97] </ref>. For experiments using real wireless network, the server runs on a stationary Windows NT workstation and the client runs on a mobile Windows 95 laptop. Speech records are transmitted by the server to the client wirelessly.

Reference-contexts: The discussion of looping problem can also be found in [BG87]. Partial remedies like split-horizon and poisoned-reverse were developed and used in wired network protocol like RIP [Hed88].

Although LS routing is seldom used for 11 wireless networks, it has more potential for providing customized routing solution for various routing criteria.

Reference-contexts: In our example: BW (A; B) = min (BW (A; G1); BW (G1; G2); BW (G2; G3); BW (G3; B) An important corollary of EQ. 4.1 is that we can now apply polynomial time bandwidth constrained shortest path algorithms such as described in <ref> [Ger86] </ref>. That is, given a target bandwidth B, we can compute the shortest path between two arbitrary nodes with bandwidth B (assuming such path exists) in O (HlgH) time, where H is the number of nodes. Moreover, as shown in [Ger86], we can compute all paths between a given node pair, <p> time bandwidth constrained shortest path algorithms such as described in <ref> [Ger86] </ref>. That is, given a target bandwidth B, we can compute the shortest path between two arbitrary nodes with bandwidth B (assuming such path exists) in O (HlgH) time, where H is the number of nodes. Moreover, as shown in [Ger86], we can compute all paths between a given node pair, routed by increasing hop distance and bandwidth. 52 4.3 QoS Extension for Distributed Bellman-Ford As well known, distance vector routing schemes, such as distributed Bellman-Ford, are subject to looping and counting-to-infinite problems [PB94].

Reference-contexts: SWAN consists of mobile units which are usually laptops, and base stations which are connected to a backbone network <ref> [Goo90] </ref>. Both the base stations and laptops are equipped with a radio interface known as the FAWN (Flexible Adapter for Wireless Networking) [TC94] card that allows them to communicate with each other wirelessly.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 3.22 shows the decrease in the routing error rate as the transmission range increases. It is because that a larger transmission range implies that more nodes can be reached in one hop without requiring a routing decision. However, as indicated in <ref> [GT95] </ref>, the spatial reuse is less efficient when the transmission range is large. It is interesting to note that in Fig. 3.22, the worst case doesn't happen when R = 80, which is the smallest range in our simulation. <p> To this extend, most researches adapt the soft state, or called Virtual Circuit method to achieve this goal. In WAMIS <ref> [GT95] </ref>, Cluster/TDMA and VC with Fast Reservation is proposed for transporting real time traffic. In the following discussion, we assume such scheme is used in our ad hoc wireless model. The Cluster/TDMA provides a easy solution for bandwidth reservation.

Reference-contexts: As a result, on-demand routing protocols are only suitable for wireless network with high bandwidth, small packet transmission delays and very sparse traffic. 2.6 Zone Routing Zone routing <ref> [Has96] </ref> is another routing protocol designed for the ad hoc environment. It is a hybrid of on-demand routing with any existing routing protocol. In zone routing, 15 each nodes defines its own zone as the nodes within certain distance of itself. Two different routing schemes are required for zone routing.

Reference-contexts: However, this computation for a QoS route that satisfies multiple addictive metrics (e.g. delay, distance, etc.) is an NP-complete problem [WC95]. To overcome this, we use a heuristic algorithm, which is similar to <ref> [Iwa96] </ref>, to compute a sub-optimal route that also satisfies two metrics: end-to-end delay and bandwidth. 4.5 Simulation Results The performance of the proposed QoS routing schemes was evaluated in a representative network example similar to the one used in previous chapter.

Reference-contexts: Another problem in LS is that a node may fail to discover the true topology change if the whole 12 network has been divided into two parts and then recovered. Solution to this problem can be found in <ref> [Jaf86] </ref>. 2.4 Path Finding New approaches based on DBF to provide loop-free routing specially for wireless network have appeared recently, such as the Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) [PB94] and the Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP) [MG95].

Reference-contexts: Research in this area can be tracked back to the '70's, when DARPA started the Packet Radio Network (PRNET) project <ref> [JT87] </ref>. The PRNET focused on the support of datagram traffic. In '90, the PRNET successors, WAMIS and GLOMO, focus on the issue of multimedia support. 4 1.2 Scope of This Research Inspired by the WAMIS project, our work focuses on the QoS issue in multihop, ad hoc networks.

Even though the looping problem is solved in these approaches, there is still a problem of routing inaccuracy in DBF which may degrade network performance. <p> Information is disseminated as the link state with larger sequence numbers replaces the one with smaller sequence numbers. In this respect, it is similar to DBF (or more precisely, the DSDV <ref> [PB94] </ref>) where the value of distances is replaced according to the time stamp of sequence number. To prepare the update message, the most intuitive way is to simply use the topology table. But doing so may cause large size update message which consumes considerable amount of bandwidth. <p> If the alternate path does not exist, DBF cannot detect it until the hop count for that node is iterated to the value of infinity, which can be as large as N . 3.4 Performance Analysis Unlike in <ref> [MG95, PB94, CE95, PC97] </ref>, where a wireless network is simulated by a static network with higher link failure rate, we used a truly mobile environment in our simulator to determine the connectivity among mobile hosts. <p> Moreover, as shown in [Ger86], we can compute all paths between a given node pair, routed by increasing hop distance and bandwidth. 52 4.3 QoS Extension for Distributed Bellman-Ford As well known, distance vector routing schemes, such as distributed Bellman-Ford, are subject to looping and counting-to-infinite problems <ref> [PB94] </ref>. In a mobile wireless network, while topology changes are caused by the host motion rather than the link exception, the looping induced by topology changes can severely affect performance. Thus, it is imperative to use a loop free routing scheme. <p> When a node receives a broadcast with an 1 metric, and it has a more recent sequence number to that destination, it triggers a route update broadcast to disseminate the important news about that destination. In <ref> [PB94] </ref>, the DSDV protocol is shown to guarantee loop-free paths to each destination at all instants. 53 The QoS extension to this DBF protocol is intuitively.

Reference-contexts: In principle, any existing shortest path algorithm can be used to create the tree. In this paper, however, the procedure listed in Section 3.5 is based on the Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [Sed83] </ref> with modifications so that the next hop table (NEXT i ) and the distance tables (D i ) are computed in parallel with the tree reconstruction. At node i, FindSP (i) initiates with P = fig, then it iterates until P = V . <p> Dijkstra's algorithm requires typically O (N 2 ) steps to compute the shortest paths from one source to all destinations, although it is possible to reduce it to O (N logN ) <ref> [Sed83] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: By this principle, the bitrate (and, hence, the quality) of an 83 audio or a video stream is varied to be consistent with the available bandwidth. Similar concept of application adaptation on data rate has been addressed in <ref> [Sis97] </ref>. However, this work focused on a traditional wired network, where lost packets are mostly caused by congestion. In that case, adaptation of data rate may be sufficient to improve the audio or video quality. Our work deals with wireless networks, where packet loss may also be caused by interference.

Reference-contexts: This is similar in spirit to the feedback mechanisms for non real-time traffic in ATM, but differs in that we aim to provide feedback right up to the application level, not just to the sending host <ref> [SM96] </ref>. Thus we incorporate renegotiation as a key part of our QoS API. Four elements compose our approach. First, we engage the support for multiple VCs over a wireless channel, and the usage of a set of per-VC QoS parameters to influence bandwidth allocation.
