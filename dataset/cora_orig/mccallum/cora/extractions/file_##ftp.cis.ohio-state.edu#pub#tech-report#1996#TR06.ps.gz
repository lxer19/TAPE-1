Abstract: We consider a class of three-dimensional dynamical systems whose state spaces are defined by piecewise constant vector fields and whose trajectories never return to a state-space region once they exit the region. We demonstrate that the reachability problem for this class of systems is decidable while the computation is provably intractable. We prove the intractability (i.e., PSPACE-completeness) via reduction of satisfiability of quantified boolean formulas to this reachability problem. This result extends the work of Asarin, Maler, and Pnueli (1995) that proves computa tional undecidability for three-dimensional constant-derivative systems.

Reference-contexts: The proof relies on a geometric construction of a VOPCD system that searches for satisfying variable assignments for a given 3SAT instance, and additional reductions for QBF. This investigation is motivated by our work on computational phase-space synthesis of global control laws for nonlinear systems <ref> (Zhao, 1995) </ref>. We have formulated the control synthesis problem as search in a stack of phase spaces parameterized by control actions, using a geometric partition of trajectories called ow pipes. We are interested in characterizing the computational complexity of this search.
