Abstract: Neurological evidence was uncovered by A. Demasio revealing the existence of emotional intelligence and its importance. Following this breakthrough many computational models of emotions were developed. Although, psychological research on emotions recognized memory and experience as the main factors that define and shape the complexity of the emotional process, existing computational models of emotion did not incorporate experience or learning. We are proposing a model of an agent named PETEEI - a PET with Evolving Emotional Intelligence. PETEEI was modeled to produce emotions according to its own experience. Furthermore, PETEEI filters and expresses emotions according to its own moods and previous experience.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for example pain may inhibit other emotional states such as pride, shame, and fear. Due to the emergence of believable and social agents, a number of computational models of emotions have been proposed within the agents community. We will review one of these models, namely, the OZ project <ref> (Bates 1992, Reilly 1996) </ref> at CMU. The OZ project simulated believable emotional and social agents. Each agent initially has preset attitudes towards certain objects in the environment. Furthermore, each agent has some initial goals and a set of strategies that it can follow to achieve each goal.

Reference-contexts: Other models developed a pure physiological simulation of emotions, where they described each emotion in terms of its physiological reactions (Picard 1997). A few others modeled the interactions between emotions, including fear and pain <ref> (Bolles and Fanselow 1980) </ref>. Event appraisal models, such as Ortony et al.'s model (Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988), relied on variables that affect the synthesis of emotions, including expectations, effort and predictions of the occurrence of events. <p> If we are going to simulate these emotions, we need to find a way to calculate variables, such as expectations. Looking at the interactions between emotions and how several emotions may inhibit or empower others, Bolles and Fanselow <ref> (Bolles and Fanselow 1980) </ref> developed a model of two motivational states, namely, fear and pain. According to their findings, fear inhibits pain in some situations and pain inhibits fear in some others. <p> The intensity of hope will then be calculated as a function of these two measures. The mixture of emotions will be filtered to produce an emotional state. The filtering process uses a variation of Bolles and Fanslows <ref> (Bolles and Fanselow 1980) </ref> model to produce a coherent mixture of emotions. In essence, the emotional state will be a list of emotions that apply at a specific time. The emotional state is passed to a behavioral selection phase.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the action, IgnoreBall, is considered more desirable than PlayWithBall. Since we are trying to simulate a believable agent, we looked at how humans make decisions. We found that emotions and moods have a great impact on their decisions <ref> (Bower and Cohen 1982, Damasio 1994, Gardner 1983 and Goleman 1995) </ref>. As noted in (Bower and Cohen 1982), when the agent is in a positive mood it will tend to be more optimistic, so it will naturally expect desirable events to occur. <p> Since we are trying to simulate a believable agent, we looked at how humans make decisions.

To replicate this phenomenon, we refined the expectation mechanism to reflect the mood.

Reference-contexts: Shibata used frustration as a fitness function to help robots cooperate in performing certain tasks (Shibita, Ohkawa, and Tanie 1996). Research on emotion defined it as a complex process that dynamically changes through personality, experience and time <ref> (Goleman 1995) </ref>. This dynamic nature of emotions was not incorporated in any of the computational models of emotion. To introduce our model we will first review some of the previous computational models of emotion and point out where these models fail to capture the complexity of the emotional process.

Reference-contexts: We knew that learning could potentially solve this problem. Our main idea is that the agent can potentially learn to link events or sequence of events with the goals affected by using reinforcement learning <ref> (Kaelbling, Littman, and Moore 1996, Mitchell 1996) </ref>; we will briefly outline one of the reinforcement algorithms, namely the Q-learning algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The behavior selection process is simulated using fuzzy rules. The emotional state will be decayed and fed back to the system for the next iteration. Additionally, there are other paths by which a behavior is produced. Some events or objects may trigger a conditioned behavior <ref> (LeDoux 1996) </ref>, as we shall discuss in the learning section. In the next couple of paragraphs, we will explore the learning process and its importance in simulating the emotional process. <p> The intensities of these emotions are calculated as a function of the value, v, of the learnt rule. Classical Learning or Conditioning Associating objects with an emotion or a motivational state, forms yet another type of learning <ref> (LeDoux 1996) </ref>. For example, if the agent experiences pain when an object, g, touches it, then a motivational state of pain will be associated with the object g. This kind of learning does not depend on the situation per se, but it depends on the object-emotion/ motivational state association.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in order to capture a meaningful pattern, we set the length of the pattern to a lower bound of two. Considering that the human mind can handle seven plus or minus two chunks <ref> (Miller 1956) </ref>; we thought that handling a pattern of three consecutive actions is suitable for our agent considering that we decided to make the agent believable rather than intelligent. There are two different operations done on a pattern.

Reference-contexts: Research on emotion has taken many alternative paths. Each path concentrated on simulating or understanding only one element in the big world of emotions. Some models were developed to understand and develop the link between events and emotions; these models were called event appraisal models <ref> (Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988, Rosman, Jose, and Spindel 1990) </ref>. Other models developed a pure physiological simulation of emotions, where they described each emotion in terms of its physiological reactions (Picard 1997).

Event appraisal models, such as Ortony et al.'s model <ref> (Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988) </ref>, relied on variables that affect the synthesis of emotions, including expectations, effort and predictions of the occurrence of events. For example, in Ortony's model joy was defined as the occurrence of a desirable event. <p> The agent perceives an event in the environment. This event is then evaluated according to the agents goals, standards and attitudes. After an event is evaluated, special rules are used to produce an emotion with a specific intensity. These rules are based on Ortony et al.s model <ref> (Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988) </ref>. The emotions triggered are then mapped, according to their intensity, to a specific behavior (Reilly 1996). Even though the model has many strong points, it still has some weaknesses. <p> The desirability measure, once calculated, will be passed to an event appraisal model to further determine the emotional state of the agent. The event appraisal model is based on Ortony et al.s model <ref> (Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988) </ref>. An emotion or a mixture of emotions will be triggered using the event desirability measure and the expectation measure, which is produced from the learning component. <p> Learning Expectations At any given time, an agent will need to know what event to expect, how certain it is that this event will happen and how desirable the event is. This information is crucial for the emotional process. It was noted in <ref> (Ortony, Clore, and Collins 1988, Rosman, Jose, and Spindel 1990) </ref> that the identification of emotions and emotional intensities depend heavily on expectations. Furthermore, desirability of events are normally measured by their impact on a set of goals.

For example, we linked the work on emotion interactions with the work on event appraisals.

Reference-contexts: For example, in Ortony's model joy was defined as the occurrence of a desirable event. In contrast, Rosman et al. formalized emotions according to event categories <ref> (Rosman, Jose, and Spindel 1990) </ref>. These categories depend on many factors, including the likelihood of events to occur and the consistency measure of an event in terms of goals. In addition, they further refined the model to include self-perception.
