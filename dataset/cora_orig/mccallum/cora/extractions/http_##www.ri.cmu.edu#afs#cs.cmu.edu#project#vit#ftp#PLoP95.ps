Abstract: Software designers rely on informal patterns, or idioms, to describe the architectures of their software systemsthe configurations of components that make up the systems. At the first PLoP, I identified seven patterns that guide high-level system design and discussed the way they guide the composition of systems from particular types of components [Shaw 95]. This paper extends the descriptions of those patterns (plus one) in response to the discussion at the conference. Most significantly, it adds information on the kinds of problems each pattern handles best. Software designers describe overall system architectures using a rich vocabulary of abstractions. Although the descriptions and the underlying vocabulary are imprecise and informal, designers nevertheless communicate with some success. They depict the architectural abstractions both in pictures and words.
