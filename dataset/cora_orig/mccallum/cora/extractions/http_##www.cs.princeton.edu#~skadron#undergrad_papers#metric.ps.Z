Title: Urban Centralization in U.S. Cities prior to World War II: Experience with a New Metric  
Author: Kevin Skadron 
Date: 28 April 1994  
Abstract: Effective urban management and planning requires an understanding of the forces driving cities' development. Trends in population density and distribution are of particular importance, but are difficult to measure, and recent studies have come to conflicting conclusions regarding the rate of decentralization in U.S. cities. We use a new metric to obtain new evidence regarding decentralization in U.S. cities prior to World War II. The new evidence is not, however, conclusive, and although the new metric may potentially be useful, we remain skeptical of the its ability to yield reliable results.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 suggests avenues for further work in this area. 2 Method We use city data provided in The Growth of Metropolitan Districts in the United States: 1900-1940, a Census publication authored by Thompson [8], and in Population Growth in Standard Metropolitan Areas: 1900-1950, by Bogue <ref> [1] </ref>. Thompson provides central city population (P c ), central city land area (L c ), and central city population density ( c ) for the years 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940.

Reference-contexts: While there is general agreement that in the postwar era cities have decentralized, studies for the pre-WWII era draw conflicting conclusions. Clark in 1951 <ref> [2] </ref> and later Mills, Muth, and Barr (cited in [3]) find significant decentralization of pre-war U.S. cities.

Reference-contexts: While there is general agreement that in the postwar era cities have decentralized, studies for the pre-WWII era draw conflicting conclusions. Clark in 1951 [2] and later Mills, Muth, and Barr (cited in <ref> [3] </ref>) find significant decentralization of pre-war U.S. cities. These studies use a monocentric model, with a single central business district (CBD), an exponential falloff in population density with distance from the CBD, and equilibrium adjustments to urban spatial structure as employment, commuting costs, and income change over time. <p> The model's defining equation is: D (x) = D 0 e x (1) Harrison and Kain, in 1973, emphasize in <ref> [3] </ref> the "disequilibrium" nature of urban growth due to durability of urban structures. They propose that new buildings reflect equilibrium conditions in commuting costs, income, etc. which exist at the time of building, but that existing buildings are torn down or converted at a negligible rate.

Reference-contexts: It is possible that the very low densities in the rural rings are distorting the results; this may be particularly true in the case of southern cities, which have a large percentage of rural population in their SMSA's <ref> [5] </ref>. One unexplored avenue is to remove these rural ring populations from the P SMSA 's and redo the regressions. U.S. cities do vary widely in structure and density; this suggests analyzing cities of only a certain type.

Reference-contexts: They conclude that pre-war U.S. cities exhibit little or no decentralization, and may in fact exhibit centralization. Mills in 1991 <ref> [6] </ref> proposes a new metric for measuring urban decentralization which does not assume a monocentric city structure and is better suited for examination of cities with multiple CBD's and varying central city land areas. <p> c = AL ff ff 1; fi &gt; 0; ff + fi &gt; 1 Except for a study of the postwar Germanys in [7], to our knowledge this measure has only been used to study determinants of suburbanization, such as race, income, and crime, and then only in modern years <ref> [4, 6] </ref>.
