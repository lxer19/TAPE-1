Abstract: In this short note we point out that in some cases batching computations on a molecular computer is very cheap. This is especially useful for breaking cryptosystems and can be useful for other applications as well. Recently Lipton [1] showed that the formula satisfaction problem can be solved by a DNA computer. This result holds for formulas with at most 70 inputs. Lipton's result was then used in [2] to show that the DES cryptosystem can be broken in roughly 4 month of work in the lab. It was pointed out that under chosen plain-text attack it only takes one day to break DES with some preprocessing. In this short note we expand on this point. Let f : f0; 1g 70 ! f0; 1g 70 be some one-to-one function on 70 inputs. The fact that f is one-to-one implies that it has an inverse which we denote by f 1 . Suppose f can be computed using a circuit of size s. The results of [3] show that using O(s) biological operations it is possible to build a soup of strands representing all elements in the set We refer to this solution as T f . The point is that given T f and a value f (x) one can easily recover x. This can be done by extracting all strands in T f containing the string f (x) on its right side. The extracted strands will represent the pair (x; f (x)). The initial section of the extracted strands can be sequences and hence x can be found. This simple process takes only several hours. The simple procedure above shows that given T f one can compute f 1 (x) very quickly. In this note we point out that if one had to compute f 1 (x 0 ); : : : ; f 1 (x m ) then one can perform the computation in time We refer to the process of evaluating the function f at many points at once as batching. On a conventional computer, if it takes time s to evaluate a function, then the time it takes to evaluate the f(x; f (x)) j x 2 f0; 1g 70 g
