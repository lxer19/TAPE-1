Title: Segmentation of Pulmonary Nodule Images Using Total Variation Minimization  
Author: Thomas F. Coleman Yuying Li Adrian Mariano 
Date: September 8, 1998  
Abstract: Total variation minimization has edge preserving and enhancing properties which make it suitable for image segmentation. We present Image Simplification, a new formulation and algorithm for image segmentation. We illustrate the edge enhancing properties of total variation minimization in a discrete setting by giving exact solutions to the problem for piecewise constant functions in the presence of noise. In this case, edges can be exactly recovered if the noise is sufficiently small. After optimization, segmentation is completed using edge detection. We find that our image segmentation approach yields good results when applied to the segmentation of pulmonary nodules.

Reference-contexts: These methods often require a priori knowledge of the number of objects in the image [7]. Region growing is a spatial approach in which pixels are regarded as the nodes of a graph. They are connected to their neighbors according to some criterion such as the difference in value <ref> [3, 1] </ref>. A segmentation is obtained by identifying the connected components of the graph. However, it only takes one extra edge in the graph to erroneously join two regions; therefore, this method is particularly susceptible to noise [9].

Reference-contexts: This optimization problem has both discrete variables that specify where region boundaries lie, and continuous variables that give the value of the approximation. A major disadvantage of this approach is that no algorithm is known that provably converges to the solution. Blake and Zisserman propose a heuristic in <ref> [2] </ref>. In [12], the idea of solving image segmentation with this type of optimization formulation is considered in great detail. Recent work has indicated the value of total variation, a technique using the ` 1 norm, in image processing.

Reference-contexts: Write circuits in binary vectors by setting the ith component equal to 1 if edge i is in the circuit, and zero otherwise. With this representation, all circuits in a graph can be represented as sums modulo 2 of the vectors corresponding to the fundamental circuits <ref> [4] </ref>. To produce a final list of circuits, we use a greedy heuristic to approximate the set of minimal circuits of the graph. Start with C equal to the empty set, and consider every circuit of the graph starting with the shortest one and proceeding in order by size.

Reference-contexts: The objective function is piecewise linear, and there is a quadratic constraint. A steepest descent type method can get stuck far from the optimum (see Figure 3); therefore, we use a modification of affine scaling, a method introduced by Coleman and Li for solving unconstrained linear ` 1 problems <ref> [5] </ref>. The dimension of the problem can be very large. In order to process an n fin image, we need to handle n 2 variables. Therefore it is crucial to exploit sparsity. The weighted total variation can be written as kBxk 1 for an appropriate matrix B.

Reference-contexts: Objects in the image are thought to have boundaries where pixel values change rapidly. Many edge detection approaches are based on discrete approximations to the gradient [7].

A major difficulty with this approach is that edge detection methods often produce edges with gaps, and they tend to produce false edges, particularly in the presence of noise.

Reference-contexts: It can be used effectively on very noisy images. Unlike other variational formulations, our proposed formulation is a convex programming problem and a solution can be computed. We apply our segmentation approach to the problem of identifying pulmonary nodules in X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans (see for example <ref> [17, 8] </ref>). Pulmonary nodules are abnormal growths in the lungs which often, but not always, lead to lung cancer. Early identification of malignant nodules is crucial for effective treatment of lung cancer.

Noise is inevitably introduced in the process of acquiring images, but sometimes the noise is very small and can be ignored.

Reference-contexts: This ability has applications 2 to image segmentation where identification of edges is very important. The ability of total variation methods to preserve edges can be understood through analysis of special cases. Strong and Chan found exact solutions to special cases of continuous total variation problems <ref> [16] </ref>. These exact solutions show that in certain special cases in the presence of noise, edges are perfectly restored by the algorithm. We present the exact solution in a discrete setting using our formulation. <p> In Theorem 1 we prove that in the noise free case Image Simplification will preserve the edges in any piecewise constant signal. By studying some simple cases, we hope to gain some insight into the general behavior of 5 Image Simplification. Strong and Chan in <ref> [16] </ref> proved similar results for con-tinuous functions using (1). We prove our results in a discrete setting with the total variation given by a discretized form of (2). In order to state the theorems we need some definitions.
