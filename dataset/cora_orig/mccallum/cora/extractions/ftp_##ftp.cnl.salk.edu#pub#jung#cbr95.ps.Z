Abstract: During drowsiness, human performance in responding to above-threshold auditory targets tends to vary irregularly over periods of 4 minutes and longer. These performance fluctuations are accompanied by distinct changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) on three time scales: (1) During minute-scale and longer periods of intermittent responding, mean activity levels in the (&lt; 4 Hz) delta and (4-6 Hz) theta bands, and at the sleep spindle frequency (14 Hz) are higher than during alert performance. (2) In most subjects, 4-6 Hz theta EEG activity begins to increase, and gamma band activity above 35 Hz begins to decrease, about 10 s before presentations of undetected targets, while before detected targets, 4-6 Hz amplitude decreases and gamma band amplitude increases. Both these amplitude differences last 15-20 s and occur in parallel with event-related cycles in target detection probability. In the same periods, alpha and sleep-spindle frequency amplitudes also show prominent 15-20 s cycles, but these are not phase locked to performance cycles. (3) A second or longer after undetected targets, amplitude at intermediate (10-25 Hz) frequencies decreases briefly, while detected targets are followed by a transient amplitude increase in the same latency and frequency range.

Reference-contexts: to task-related differences in local brain metabolism reported in many PET and fMRI brain studies [20,24], suggesting a possible relation between EEG spectral perturbations and the size of local brain blood-flow changes. 5 Conclusions Concurrent activity on a wide range of time scales is a basic fact of brain physiology <ref> [3] </ref>. Our results show that during periods of impaired performance on an auditory vigilance task, at least three time scales characterize the dynamics of variations in auditory detection performance and the EEG spectrum.

Reference-contexts: At high error rates, mean amplitude near 10 Hz at site Pz/Oz also decreased in most subjects below its eyes-open baseline level. The 14-Hz peak appears only when error rate is above 80%, consistent with the emergence of 14-Hz spindles at sleep onset <ref> [7] </ref>). At high error rates, the error-sorted spectrum at Cz prior to hits (Fig. 1b) also contain a peak near 14 Hz, but has no peak near 5 Hz.

Reference-contexts: Averages of time-frequency transforms of EEG epochs time locked to experimental events can measure event-related modulations of EEG amplitude at a wide range of frequencies and time scales (tenths of seconds <ref> [12] </ref> to minutes or longer [9,18]). Time- and frequency-specific ERSP features are largely independent of concurrent features of time-domain response averages (event-related potentials or ERPs).

Reference-contexts: Under sustained low-arousal conditions or when subjects are fatigued, these drowsy periods may progress into sleep episodes. Minute-scale changes in the probability of detection of above-threshold signals during auditory vigilance tasks are accompanied by simultaneous shifts in spectral amplitude of several relatively narrow EEG frequency bands <ref> [18] </ref>, these changes appearing to index the action of brain mechanisms involved in modulating arousal and/or auditory information processing in and near to sleep [26]. One hallmark of the transition from drowsiness to sleep is the appearance of EEG sleep spindles, intermittent oscillatory thalamocortical bursts near 14 Hz [7,25]. <p> Channel locations were selected as likely to contain independent alertness information on the basis of previous studies <ref> [18] </ref>. Bipolar vertical and horizontal electrooculogram (EOG) data were also recorded for use in artifact rejection. Data windows containing potential deviations from baseline of more than 75 uV were rejected from analysis.

Reference-contexts: Second-order spectral analyses of amplitude variance at each EEG frequency (not shown), applied to the same epochs used to compute the ERSPs (Fig. 2), revealed a peak cycle length between 15 and 20 s per cycle over a wide range of EEG frequencies, consistent with other reports <ref> [19] </ref>. The 15-20 s theta and gamma perturbations in Fig. 3a, then, may result from mutual phase locking of spontaneous amplitude fluctuations at these frequencies, uncorrelated with 15-20 s fluctuations at lower (&lt; 4 Hz) and intermediate frequencies (10-25 Hz). <p> Conversely, nora-drenergic locus coeruleus activation is known to produce behavioral alerting, accompanied by a rapid shift of the cortical EEG spectrum from low to high frequencies [27]. Possibly, a similar modulator may underlie the 15-20 s performance and EEG fluctuations seen both in quietly resting <ref> [19] </ref> and here in drowsy humans. More than one brain arousal subsystem may also be involved in producing them [25].
