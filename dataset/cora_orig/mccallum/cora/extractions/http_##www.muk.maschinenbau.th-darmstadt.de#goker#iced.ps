Abstract: Experiments were conducted to improve our understanding concerning the experience-based problem solving approach human beings prefer when they are solving routine problems. The results of these experiments and the methods and structure provided by Engineering Design Methodology were combined to implement a Conceptual Design Assistant (CoDA). The system is based on the Case-Based Reasoning approach and is able to support the design engineer with experience about methods and objects. Um das erfahrungsbasierte Vorgehen, das Menschen beim Lsen von Routineaufgaben bevorzugen, besser zu verstehen, wurden Untersuchungen durchgefhrt. Aufbauend auf den Ergebnissen dieser Untersuchungen und den Strukturen und Methoden der Konstruktionsmethodik wurde ein Konstruktions-Assistent fr die Konzeptphase (CoDA) entwickelt. Das System basiert auf dem Ansatz des Fallbasierten Schlieens und ist in der Lage den Konstrukteur mit Methodik und Objektwissen zu untersttzen.

Reference-contexts: 1. MOTIVATION Human beings do not reason from first principles but rely extensively on their memory of experiences while they are performing routine tasks <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. The elementary methods and structure of the domain are used only, when we are faced with an unknown situation where we do not already know the solution, i.e. when we are novices in the domain [4, 5, 6]. Engineers behave in a similar manner while designing. <p> To design by purely using EDM equals to try to talk a foreign language by using only its grammar and a dictionary. In this paper we describe the results of a research project in which a computer system based on the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) methodology <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> is being developed. During the project, research in Cognitive Psychology, CBR and EDM was done. It was shown how the experience of a person develops during the design process, how it is indexed, retrieved, adapted and evaluated, and how it effects the solutions he produces. <p> CASE-BASED REASONING Based on the results of various experiments in Cognitive Science, researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence devised a methodology, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), for implementing systems that simulate the experience based problem solving approach of human beings <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. A Case-Based Reasoner solves new problems by adapting solutions to previously solved similar problems to the new requirements. It is built upon the premise that human beings reason mostly from experience and not from first principles.

This is actually not quite surprising if we consider the proposed similarity between a grammar of a domain and EDM. Like a grammar, engineers tend to apply EDM consciously especially when they are hard-pressed for solutions and know no way out.

Reference-contexts: Their ability to transfer the problem at hand into tasks to which solutions can be found, the approach they take and the quality of their solution depend on their capability to relate the problem to prior experience and domain knowledge (see also <ref> [7] </ref>). If the problem is familiar, engineers solve it directly. Only novices, or experts faced with a problem they do not have experience with, use the methods and structure of the domain extensively. The elementary methods and structure form the grammar of a domain.

Reference-contexts: The elementary methods and structure form the grammar of a domain. A grammar provides us with means to analyze old, and to generate new cases (experiences) in that domain. We propose that Engineering Design Methodology (EDM) <ref> [e.g. 8, 9, 10, 11] </ref> can be used as a grammar for engineering design, and that systems that assist human engineers in performing design tasks can be realized by combining this grammar with experience in the form of cases.

They provide solutions to a class of problems.

Reference-contexts: None of the test persons knew the computer program beforehand. We transcribed the video recordings of the problem solving sessions into various types of protocols and analyzed them. Details of these experiments can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. We were able to observe that test persons "understood" and solved the assignments based on the experience they had with similar situations.

Reference-contexts: Only the attributes that are necessary to be able to determine if the object is applicable in the given situation are taken into the list of attributes (i.e. object parameter lists <ref> [13] </ref>). It is definitely not the aim of the case-base to describe the objects with all their properties, in their entirety. The last attribute is therefore an identification number with which further documentation regarding the object can be obtained.

Reference-contexts: It is definitely not the aim of the case-base to describe the objects with all their properties, in their entirety. The last attribute is therefore an identification number with which further documentation regarding the object can be obtained. The cases can be structured according to two hierarchies (see also <ref> [14] </ref>). The abstraction / concretization hierarchy is based on a "is_a" relation and mirrors the development of the product according to the EDM phases. The aggregation / decomposition hierarchy on the other hand, is based on the "is_part_of" relation.

Reference-contexts: Nearest neighbor matching assumes that the more properties the requested solution and the found case have in common the more similar they are. This is the approach that is also used in standard EDM evaluation procedures <ref> [15] </ref>. By using template matching one can search for a certain group (template) of properties to occur in the retrieved case.
