Abstract: Shorts and opens are the most common types of defects in today's CMOS ICs. In this paper we show for the first time that an open in the interconnect wiring of a digital CMOS circuit can cause oscillation or sequential behavior. We also analyze and compare the factors affecting the probabilities for an interconnect open and a feedback bridging fault to oscillate or display sequential behavior.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Opens are one of the most common types of defects that occur during an IC manufacturing process [1]. Opens fall into different categories depending on their location in a digital CMOS circuit: An open can occur inside a CMOS cell affecting transistor drain and source connections <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5] </ref>, at the gate input of a single transistor [6, 7], or on the interconnect separating a set of logic-gate inputs from their drivers, which allows the input voltage to float. <p> Note that this circuit would never oscillate if it did not have the interconnect open or any other defect. The voltage around which f loat will oscillate is determined by the values of C V DD , C GND , and the Miller capacitances <ref> [2] </ref> in the inverter driven by f loat, as shown in Figure 3. Given these capacitances, the size of C wire to wire determines the V float =V q ratio. If C wire to wire is not large enough, oscilla tion will not occur. <p> If C wire to wire is not large enough, oscilla tion will not occur. Since the gate/source and the gate/drain capacitances for the inverter in Figure 3, also referred to as the Miller capacitances by Konuk et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, are non-linear, and the voltage at the output of the inverter has a non-linear relationship to its input, we used HSPICE simulation to see the effects of these Miller capacitances.

Reference-contexts: In today's CMOS ICs with five or more metal layers, interconnect wiring seems to be the most likely place for an open occur. Vias are especially susceptible to opens, and the number of vias is exceeding the number of transistors in some microprocessor designs <ref> [8] </ref>. We call the fault created by an open in the interconnect wiring an interconnect open. In this paper we show that an interconnect open can create capacitive feedback paths in a CMOS circuit, thus causing oscillation and sequential behavior.

Reference-contexts: Note that C wire to wire is the only feedback capacitance in the example of Figure 1. Let's now assign some values to these capacitances. In order to come up with realistic values, we used the MAGIC technology file available from MOSIS <ref> [9] </ref> for the HP 0.6 fabrication process. We used 20fF for each C W , which corresponds to a 153 long minimum width metal-1 wire over substrate. For comparison, the cell height in the MCNC cell library is 17.4 in this process. <p> We simulated the circuit in Figure 1 using the MCNC cell library with HSPICE with V DD = 3.3V, and using the BSIM parameters for the HP 0.6 process from MOSIS <ref> [9] </ref>. The HSPICE results are shown in Figure 2. We started with all the nodes at 0V, and powered up the circuit during the first 1ns, that is, V DD went from 0V to 3.3V. At 3ns, signal S in Figure 1 went from 3.3V to 0V in 1ns.

Reference-contexts: Point b corresponds to a metastable state, because even the slightest disturbance on V float will kick the solution point to either a or c, very much like ble states the metastability in a latch <ref> [14] </ref>. Therefore, point b is not a real solution. Points a and c are stable states.

Reference-contexts: Additional information on the oscillation frequency and amplitude, and IDDQ testability of feedback bridging faults is given by [15, 16, 17, 18]. For a feedback bridging fault, we need to use the concepts of back gate, back wire, front gate, and front wire <ref> [19] </ref>, which are depicted in the example of Figure 12. In order for a feedback bridging fault to display feedback behavior, at least the combinational path from the back wire to an input of the front gate needs to be sensitized. We call this condition partial sensitization.

Reference-contexts: Bridging Resistance Here again we assume either a partial or full sensitization condition. So far we assumed the bridging resistance to be zero, but Rodriguez-Montanes et al. <ref> [20] </ref> showed that most of the metal bridging resistances fall into the range from 0 to 1000 in an experimental study. <p> However, it stops oscillating when R short 450. Similarly, we showed that the same circuit with R short = 0 displays sequential behavior only when we insert an additional inverter. However, the sequential behavior disappears when R short 427. According to Rodriguez-Montanes et al. <ref> [20] </ref>, 31% of the bridges have a resistance greater than 500. 4.2 Feedback Activation for Opens Given a vector applied to the combinational circuit inputs, all the nodes that have a wire-to-wire or a Miller capacitance to the floating wire that is created by an interconnect open fall into two classes:
