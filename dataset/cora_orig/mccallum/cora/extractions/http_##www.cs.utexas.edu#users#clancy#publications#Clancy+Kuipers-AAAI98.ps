Abstract: Traditionally, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are characterized using a finite set of constraints expressed within a common, shared constraint language. When reasoning across time, however, it is possible to express both temporal and state-based constraints represented within multiple constraint languages. Qualitative simulation provides an instance of this class of CSP in which, traditionally, all solutions to the CSP are computed. In this paper, we formally describe this class of temporally-extended CSPs and situate qualitative simulation within this description. This is followed by a description of the DecSIM algorithm which is used to incrementally generate all possible solutions to a temporally-extended CSP. DecSIM combines problem decomposition, a tree-clustering algorithm and ideas similar to directed arc-consistency to exploit structure and causality within a qualitative model resulting in an exponential speed-up in simulation time when compared to existing techniques.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical Results Traditional techniques for qualitative simulation, while both sound and complete with respect to the CSP defined by the model, are unable to scale to larger problems. 9 DecSIM, on the other hand, trades completeness for efficiency. The following results are established in <ref> (Clancy & Kuipers 1998) </ref>. 9 Note the incompleteness of qualitative simulation is with respect to the set of real valued trajectories described by the behavioral description and not the CSP.

Reference-contexts: The continuity constraints correspond to temporal restrictions. The use of temporal constraints within qualitative simulation has been further generalized within the TeQSIM algorithm to allow the specification of an arbitrary temporal constraint (Brajnik & Clancy 1996; 1997). TeQSIM uses a propositional linear-time temporal logic (PLTL) <ref> (Emerson 1990) </ref> that combines propositional state-formulae specifying either qualitative or quantitative information about a state with temporal operators such as next, eventually, always, and until. Each qualitative behavior generated during simulation corresponds to a solution to the CSP defined by the composition of the state-based constraints with the temporal constraints.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Traditionally, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are characterized using a finite set of constraints expressed within a common, shared constraint language <ref> (Tsang 1993) </ref>. When reasoning across time, however, it is possible to express both temporal and state-based constraints represented within multiple constraint languages. A state-based constraint specifies restrictions between variables that must hold at any given point in time while a temporal constraint specifies restrictions that occur across time.
