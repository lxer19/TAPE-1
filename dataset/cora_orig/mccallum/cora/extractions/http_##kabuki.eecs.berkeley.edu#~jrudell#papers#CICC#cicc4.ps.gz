Abstract: The multiplier is the building block required in the adaptive equalizer that is most costly in terms of both speed and po wer. Since the power consumed by a CMOS digital circuit is CV 2 f, reducing the power supply and employing one or a combination of parallelism and pipelining can result in a signif icant power savings [4]. Applications using a po wer supply of 3.3 V are becoming widespread in order to reap this reduction in po wer. Implementation of PRML channels are typically using 6 bits into the adaptive equalizer dictated by the off-channel signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive simulations were performed to e xplore various permutations of parallelism and pipelining in the implementation of a conventional multiplier [5] for filter sampling rates above 50 MHz and a power supply of 3.3 V. It was found that for implementation of a 6-bit by 6-bit multiplier , the use of 4 multipliers operating in parallel and staggered in phase by the output period T as shown in Figure 2 resulted in the solution dissipating the lowest overall power. This advantage of low power comes at the cost of increased silicon area which, ho wever, will scale with technology. For the required resolution of 6 bits, the o verhead associated with pipeline latches in a pipelined implementation of the multiplier increases the power while decreasing the attainable speed (due to latch set-up times). Abstract - A new architecture for digital implementation of the adaptive equalizer in Class IV P artial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) channels employing parallelism and pipelin-ing is described. The architecture was used in a prototype integrated circuit in a 1.2 mm CMOS technology to implement a 50 MHz adaptive equalizer and Viterbi sequence detector dissi Sampled-data techniques such as Class IV Partial Response with Maximum Likelihood detection (PR-IV) are being applied to magnetic disk drive read channels in order to increase transfer rates and recording densities [1-2]. In order to pro vide robust implementation of the functions required in these channels, implementation of key blocks such as timing reco very, adaptive equalization, and sequence detection are often in the digital domain. The power consumed by these blocks can be appreciable due to the high speeds of operation required in these channels with data rates on the order of 50-100 Mbits/sec and be yond. Power consumption is critical due to the demand for battery operated portable systems and the proximity of the electronics to the magnetic media as form factors continually decrease. The latter is particularly important due to heat dissipation of the electronics and its effect on the media. The CMOS logic alone in a BiCMOS 65 Mbits/sec read channel IC implementing among other functions those of digital equalization and sequence detec This paper describes an architecture for digital implementation of an adaptive equalizer suitable for use in PRML disk drive channels. The new architecture was used in a prototype IC containing an 8-tap 50 MHz sampling rate adapti ve equalizer and a Viterbi detector and consumes a total of 70 mW operating of f of a 3.3 V power supply in a 1. 2 mm CMOS technology. There are two key ideas used in the implementation of the adapti ve equalizer. First, parallelism and pipelining are emplo yed in the architecture to achieve a high throughput rate at the reduced po wer supply voltage of 3.3 V. Second, the sign-LMS algorithm is used for coefficient adaptation and tracking and results in impro ved A block diagram of a PR-IV read channel is sho wn in Figure 2. The output of the magnetic disk is f irst amplified by the read amplifier before being passed on to the analog front-end which includes a variable gain amplifier (controlled in an automatic gain control loop not shown), lowpass filter, sampler, and analog-to-digital converter followed by the functions of adapti ve equalization, sequence detection, and timing recovery in the digital domain. The adaptive equalizer operates on the 6-bit samples from the A/D converter, equalizing these samples for subsequent detection by the sequence detector and use by the timing reco very block. The prototype IC contains the adapti ve equalizer and sequence detector blocks. pating 70 mW from a 3.3 V supply.
