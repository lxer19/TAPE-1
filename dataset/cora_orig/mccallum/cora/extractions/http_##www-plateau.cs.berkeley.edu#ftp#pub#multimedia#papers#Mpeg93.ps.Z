Reference-contexts: First, we wanted to determine whether MPEG video could be decoded in real-time using a software-only implementation on current generation desktop computer. Second, we needed to develop a portable software decoder for inclusion in the Continuous Media Player being developed at U.C. Berkeley <ref> [1] </ref>. And third, we wanted to contribute public domain source code to the research community. This paper describes the design and implementation of the decoder. A novel feature of our decoder is the use of a dithering algorithm in YCrCb-space. <p> Implementation The decoder is structured to process a small, implementation dependent quantum of macroblocks at a time so it can be suspended between any quantum of macrob-locks. We envision using the decoder as a part of a larger system (the CM Player <ref> [1] </ref>) for delivering video data over local networks. This architecture is required by the player for timesharing CPU resources and servicing other tasks required in a multimedia system (e.g., handling user input or playing other media). The decoder was implemented in C using the X Win-dowing System.

Reference-contexts: The following table shows the results: Parsing includes all functions involved in bitstream parsing, entropy and motion vector decoding, and coefficient reconstruction. The IDCT code, which is called up to six times per macroblock, is a slightly modif ied version of the fastest public domain IDCT available <ref> [2] </ref>. The algorithm applies a 1 dimensional IDCT to each row and then to each column. Zero coefficients are detected and used to avoid unnecessary calculation. Functions that perform predictive pixel reconstruction, including copying and averaging relevant pixels from reference frames, are grouped under the category reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: Dithering to full color devices simply requires RGB conversion. Dithering to gray scale devices is done by using only the luminance plane of the image. For color mapped devices, two dithering techniques are used: error dif fusion (sometime called Floyd-Steinber g) and ordered dither. Both are discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. In error dif fusion dithering, each image pixel is mapped to the closest pixel in a fixed-size color map. In our decoder, the color map has 128 entries, with 3 bits allocated for luminance, and 2 bits for each chrominance channel. <p> This scheme can be easily extended to dither color images. For further details, the interested reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> and [6]. When implementing the decoder , we started with a straightforward implementation of the error diffusion algorithm with propagation of 4 error values ( FS4). The first improvement we tried was to implement a error diffusion algorithm with only 2 propagated error values (FS2).

More complete descriptions are given in an introductory paper <ref> [4] </ref> and the ISO standard [5]. Video data can be represented as a set of images, I 1 , I 2 , ..., I N , that are displayed sequentially.

Reference-contexts: A draft proposal was agreed upon in September, 1990. Since then, minor changes have been made and released. The work described in this paper is based on the December 1991 committee draft <ref> [5] </ref>. Many research and commercial groups have developed MPEG decoders. Because of the high stakes involved in commercializing MPEG technology (e.g., videoconferencing, HDTV, and multimedia computing), these groups have been reluctant to release their coders, decoders, and bitstreams. <p> Lastly, we describe the experience of publishing this software on the Internet. 2. The MPEG Video Coding Model This section briey describes the MPEG video coding model. More complete descriptions are given in an introductory paper [4] and the ISO standard <ref> [5] </ref>. Video data can be represented as a set of images, I 1 , I 2 , ..., I N , that are displayed sequentially. <p> Each of these blocks is processed in the same manner as JPEG: the blocks are transformed using the DCT and the resulting coefficients quantized, run length encoded to remove zeros, and entropy coded. The details can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>, but the important facts for this paper are that: 1) the frame is structured as a set of macrob-locks, 2) each block in the macroblock is processed using the DCT, and 3) each block, after quantization, contains many zeros.

Reference-contexts: MPEG video coding uses three techniques to compress video data. The f irst technique, called transform coding, is similar to JPEG image compression <ref> [7] </ref>. Transform coding exploits two facts: 1) the human eye is relatively insensitive to high frequency visual information and 2) certain mathematical transforms concentrate the energy of an image, which allows the image to be repre Performance of a Software MPEG Video Decoder* Ketan Patel, Brian C.

Conclusions Several conclusions can be drawn from this work. First, while IDCT performance is important, it is not the most critical process in a software decoder . Data structure organization and bit-level manipulations are critical. Second, memory bandwidth is critical on RISC processors.
