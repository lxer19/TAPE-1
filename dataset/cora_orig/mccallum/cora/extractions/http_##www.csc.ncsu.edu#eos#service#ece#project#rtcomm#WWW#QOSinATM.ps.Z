Abstract: We investigate a method for supporting diverse quality-of-service requirements in broadband networks based on ATM technology. The method uses deterministic bandwidth reservation at the Virtual Path (VP) level and statistical multiplexing within each VP. A deterministic server such as a Weighted Round Robin (WRR) server is used to enforce bandwidth reservations among the VPs. We develop a connection admission algorithm which accounts for end-to-end delay and loss guarantees for Virtual Circuits which traverse a single VP. We show that under certain conditions the amount of network bandwidth required by a VP is minimized by incurring all the allowable loss at the first link of a VP. Achievable utilization is demonstrated using simulation. The effect of the parameters of the WRR server (i.e., the vacation time) on the cell loss probability is also studied using simulation.

Reference-contexts: We would like to statistically multiplex all the different traffic types together to obtain the maximum multiplexing gain. However, several studies have shown that different traffic types which vary widely in burstiness do not multiplex very well. As an example, Bae et al <ref> [1] </ref> have shown that the QoS specification for a set of heterogeneous sources may have to be set more stringent than the most stringent of any of the individual QoS requirements to ensure all sources receive their required QoS. Hence a mechanism for separating out different traffic types seems necessary.

Reference-contexts: Feedback-based schemes will be used to a limited extent in the high-speed network environment mainly because of the high delay-bandwidth product and low loss requirements. Cruz <ref> [2] </ref> has shown that with simple work-conserving FIFO, as loss tolerance approaches 0, the buffer requirement grows exponentially with the number of hops (H) in the path. Equivalently, if we use smaller buffers, we may have to allocate more than the peak bandwidth to ensure zero loss.

Reference-contexts: A1 Bandwidth allocation of each VP in the network is performed independently of other VPs. Under this assumption, statistical multiplexing is not performed across VPs. Assumption A1 has been applied by others to the VC level where bandwidth allo cation is required to be linear <ref> [3] </ref>, [5]. A2 The nodal independence assumption applies. Under this assumption, the same traffic model can be used for a VC at an intermediate node as that used at the network edge. <p> Figures 3 and 4 show the per-source effective bandwidth requirement for a multiplexed set of voice sources and a multiplexed set of video sources, respectively. These curves are obtained by using the equivalent bandwidth approximation [5], <ref> [3] </ref>. The delay shown in the curves is the maximum queuing delay that would be encountered in the first hop of the VP onto which the sources are multiplexed. The standard On-Off model with exponentially distributed On and Off durations was used for the voice sources [12]. <p> For 20 voice sources and 200 msecs of delay, 80% utilization can be achieved. Typical end-to-end acceptable delay limits are up to 250-300 msecs. The equivalent capacity formulas are in fact conservative over-estimates and thus in practice even higher utilizations will be achieved <ref> [3] </ref>. Clearly, for both video and voice traffic a single level of multiplexing is able to achieve high utilization.

Reference-contexts: Several CAC and flow control schemes for end-to-end QoS guarantees exist but require peak bandwidth allocation [10], <ref> [4] </ref>. Schemes employing statistical bandwidth allocation exist for the single link case [5],[6]. but have not been extended to the multi-hop case so far. multiplexing to the multi-hop case. <p> Equivalently, if we use smaller buffers, we may have to allocate more than the peak bandwidth to ensure zero loss. In comparison, the use of a non-work-conserving scheduler can always guarantee zero losses, while requiring only O (H) buffer requirements and peak bandwidth allocation <ref> [4] </ref>. Clearly, for the multi-hop case there are situations when it is better to be non-work-conserving than to be work-conserving. We would like to statistically multiplex all the different traffic types together to obtain the maximum multiplexing gain. <p> VP bandwidth guarantees are enforced using a deterministic scheduler. In this paper we investigate the use of a Weighted Round Robin (WRR) type scheduler (also called multi-rate time-division multiplexing). The WRR scheduler is very simple to implement and analyze. Many other deterministic schedulers, such as Stop&Go <ref> [4] </ref> or Weighted Fair Queuing [10] could also be used. However, these are significantly more complicated than WRR, and with our method WRR is good enough to achieve high utilizations (as we will show).

A3 The traffic characteristics of each VC are such that the bandwidth requirement is monotonic wrt tolerable loss. That is, the more loss that can be tolerated by a VC, the smaller is its bandwidth requirement. This assumption is supported by the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: not unduly constraining if it is done at a sufficiently coarse level (at the VP level). 2.3 The Maximal Gain First QoS Allocation Policy In any scheme, the end-to-end QoS specifications are split into per-link specifications; if the "per-link" QoS specifications are met, the end-to-end QoS specification can be met <ref> [9] </ref>. We refer to these as "QoS allocation policies". In this section, we examine a particular policy for allocating an end-to-end CLP specification into per-link CLP specifications.

Reference-contexts: If B h j 2 fl n j ; h = 2; 3; : : : H, then p h Proof : The proof follows from the non work-conserving nature of the WRR server <ref> [11] </ref> 2. If adequate buffer space is reserved and a deterministic server is used, no losses are incurred by statistical multiplexing of VCs onto a single VP at the second and successive nodes along the VP. <p> by any cell of V j which traverses H physical hops, is given by D max = bB 1 j bB 1 P H prop (1) where C is the physical link capacity (assumed same for all hops), and T h prop is the propagation delay for the h'th hop <ref> [11] </ref>. Denote by F (i; j), the CAC function used within VP V j to admit or deny admission to requesting VC i. The exact nature of the CAC function is not critical to our discussion. <p> Proof: This is proved using sample path techniques in <ref> [11] </ref>. 2. Admittedly, a WRR server does not strictly conform to the G=D=1 model because of the vacations. However, as the simulation results in section 3 will indicate, when the server cycle length is "sufficiently" small the effect of vacations is negligible. <p> Proof: The proof is in <ref> [11] </ref>. Assumption A1 is used to examine V j in isolation from other VPs in the network. The monotonicity relation in assumption A3 then yields the desired result. 2 This theorem shows that MGF is an optimal QoS allocation policy for our method. <p> The small sacrifice in utilization from VP isolation seems well worth the gain in predictability of end-to-end QoS which is obtained by our scheme. We also simulated other choices of number of sources, bandwidths, link speeds, buffer sizes, etc. The results were similar to those reported above <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We proposed a method for providing QoS support in an ATM networks. The method uses deterministic bandwidth reservation at the VP (Virtual Path) level and statistical multiplexing of VCs within each VP.
