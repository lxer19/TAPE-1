Title: SIMILARITY OF BLOCK DIAGONAL AND BLOCK TRIANGULAR MATRICES Vadim Olshevsky Integral Equations and Operator Theory,  
Date: (1992), 853-863.  
Pubnum: 15  
Abstract: It is shown that if a block triangular matrix is similar to its block diagonal part, then the similarity matrix can be chosen of the block triangular form. An analogous statement is proved for equivalent matrices. For the simplest case of 2 fi 2 block matrices these results were obtained by W.Roth [1]. It is shown that all these results do not admit a generalization for the infinite dimensional case.

Reference-contexts: Analogously, from (0.4) it follows that the solvability of equation (0.2) implies the equivalence of the matrices E and F from (0.5) (equal rank). W.Roth <ref> [1] </ref> obtained the converse for the last two statements, namely: if matrices E and F from (0.5) are similar, then equation (0.1) has a solution. Moreover, it was proved in [1] that the equivalence of matrices E and F implies the solvability of (0.2). <p> W.Roth <ref> [1] </ref> obtained the converse for the last two statements, namely: if matrices E and F from (0.5) are similar, then equation (0.1) has a solution. Moreover, it was proved in [1] that the equivalence of matrices E and F implies the solvability of (0.2). These results imply that if matrices E and F from (0.5) are similar then the similarity matrix can be chosen to be of the upper block triangular form 0 I . <p> Analogously, if E and F are equivalent, then one can choose the equivalence matrices to be of the upper block triangular forms 0 I and I X ! Since <ref> [1] </ref> a number of different proofs of Roth's theorems were obtained mostly passing to the corresponding canonical forms (see for example [2-5]). In section 1 of the present paper we give short new proofs based on geometrical arguments.

Reference-contexts: The equivalence of the conditions (i) and (ii) in theorem 1.1 is well known in the more general framework of the theory of matrix Ricatti equations (see, for example, <ref> [7, p. 545] </ref>). The assertion about the equivalence of condition (ii) in theorem 1.2 to the other conditions seems to be new. PROOF OF THEOREM 1.1. The proof of the implications (i) ) (iv)) (iii) poses no difficulties. Assume therefore that condition (iii) holds and prove (ii). <p> PROOF OF THEOREM 1.1. The proof of the implications (i) ) (iv)) (iii) poses no difficulties. Assume therefore that condition (iii) holds and prove (ii). Alongside with the matrices E and F consider also the matrix F ff = A ffC ! 0 ffI F I 0 ! In <ref> [7, p.488] </ref> it was shown that for every matrix E there is a constant K &gt; 0 such that for every matrix H which is similar to E we have kI Sk KkH Ek for some nonsingular matrix S, satisfying S 1 HS = E. <p> One can deduce lemma 3.3 from [8,9] (see also <ref> [7, p.476] </ref>), but we prefer to give a direct and simple proof.
