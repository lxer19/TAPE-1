Abstract: In a free-market economy of software agents, information is produced, traded, and consumed by vast numbers of autonomous, self-motivated agents. An essential task in this economy is the retailing or brokering of information, whereby information is gathered from the right producers and distributed to the right consumers. This paper investigates one crucial aspect of a broker's dynamical behavior, its ability to specialize|i.e., to carve out a market niche for itself in a highly dynamic, potentially competitive environment|in the context of a simple information filtering economy.

Reference-contexts: All of the above motivates a general, wide-ranging study of economically motivated autonomous agents. In this and a pair of companion papers <ref> [6, 7] </ref>, we have chosen to work within the context of a simple model of an information filtering economy, in which information brokers, which purchase selected information goods from a producer agent and resell them to selected consumers, play the central role. <p> We close with a discussion of the overall results and of directions for future work. 2 A model news filtering economy Our model system is an information filtering economy, first described in ref. <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> The broker's evaluation method|which may involve a categorization scheme entirely different from that used by the source|is approximated by an interest vector fi b , where fi bj represents the probability for b to purchase an article labeled with category j. Analysis of the model <ref> [6] </ref> shows that it is in broker b's best interest to set the fi bj individually to either 0 or 1. When broker b purchases an article, it immediately sends it to a set of subscribing consumers, paying transportation cost P T for each. <p> For consumers, the anticipated value V provides the fundamental benchmark for measuring utility. For brokers, the appropriate measure of utility is profit, defined in the usual way as revenue less expenses. General expressions for consumer utility and broker profit may be found in ref. <ref> [6] </ref>. In closing this section, let us observe that our model disregards a number of potentially interesting features of real information filtering systems. By assigning a single category index to each article, it disregards articles that fall into multiple categories. <p> The subscription matrix S is now a vector with elements S c . The broker utility W is given by (cf. ref. <ref> [6] </ref>): W = j=1 " c=1 # The product ff j fi j is the probability, per published article, that the broker will buy an article in category j. The term in square braces is the expected net revenue per article in category j. <p> forms of the broker and consumer utilities: W = c=1 U c = S c [ fl c (V P ) P C ] (3) If both brokers and consumers set their subscriptions independently to optimize their utilities (i.e., they pursue a game-theoretic solution), it can be shown (cf. ref. <ref> [6] </ref>) that the subscription vector element S c depends only on the broker's price P and fl c , and is given by S c ( fl c ; P ) = fi ( fl c P P T )fi ( fl c (V P ) P C ) (4) where

Reference-contexts: All of the above motivates a general, wide-ranging study of economically motivated autonomous agents. In this and a pair of companion papers <ref> [6, 7] </ref>, we have chosen to work within the context of a simple model of an information filtering economy, in which information brokers, which purchase selected information goods from a producer agent and resell them to selected consumers, play the central role. <p> Ref. <ref> [7] </ref> examined the dynamics of the brokers' price-setting behavior in a competitive environment. This paper focuses on the complementary aspect of broker specialization, as measured by the brokers' individual selections of which, and how many, types of information good to carry. <p> For each hypothesis, the broker's profitability is accurately determined under the assumption that the other brokers do not change. The broker then sets its parameters to match the hypothesis that gave the best profit. The profitability calculation, described in ref. <ref> [7] </ref>, is feasible because only one broker's parameters are being set. We might think of the evaluation of a few hypotheses as a form of market research. <p> Also note the initial wild fluctuations in broker profit, with attendant fluctuations in category coverage. These are caused by a sorting-out period in which brokers are collectively forming, breaking, and reforming price-and-category wars of the type reported in ref. <ref> [7] </ref>. At this setting of extrinsic costs, a single-broker system prefers to offer only one category.

Reference-contexts: In an open system like the Web, no such goal exists. Each agent has its own set of objectives, which may coincide with, conflict with, or (most probably) simply be incommensurable with, the goals of other agents <ref> [10] </ref>. The success or viability of the economy is determined on an agent-by-agent basis: if an agent can achieve its goals, the economy "works"; if not, it doesn't. Therefore the success of market-driven optimization can provide encouragement, but not proof, of a free-market agent economy's ultimate survival.
