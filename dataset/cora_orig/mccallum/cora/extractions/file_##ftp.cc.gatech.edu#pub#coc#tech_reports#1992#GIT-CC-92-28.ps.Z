Abstract: The problem of collecting responses in multi-hop radio networks is considered. A given node, called the source, is to collect a specified number of responses from nodes in a radio network. The problem arises in several applications of distributed systems. A deterministic and a randomized protocol for the problem are presented. The two protocols are analyzed and their performance is compared. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability of our protocols in various network environments.

Reference-contexts: We begin with a lemma to compute the probability for a related problem. The following lemma follows from an argument similar to the first theorem of Bar-Yehuda, et al. <ref> [BGI87] </ref> and using the observation that a response cycle has at least log timeslots in which x in the lemma may receive from its neighbors, while x has at most neighbors.

This protocol sends the broadcast messages from multiple sources to the root of the BFS tree that has been constructed before any broadcasts are performed. <p> We will discuss the performance of the deterministic protocol in Section 7, but first we will describe the randomized protocol. 6 The Randomized Collection Protocol Bar-Yehuda et al. developed a randomized collection protocol as a subprotocol of multiple broadcasts <ref> [BII89] </ref>. The protocol sends the broadcast messages from multiple sources to the root of a breadth first search (BFS) tree that is constructed before any broadcasts are performed. Unlike this protocol, our randomized protocol does not construct a BFS tree, which is relatively costly. <p> Unlike this protocol, our randomized protocol does not construct a BFS tree, which is relatively costly. Thus the deterministic active acknowledgement protocol in <ref> [BII89] </ref> cannot be used. Instead, we use passive (or echo) acknowledgements. In addition to assumptions in Section 2, we assume each node knows , the maximum degree over all nodes in the network (actually, knowledge of a reasonable upper bound on is sufficient).
