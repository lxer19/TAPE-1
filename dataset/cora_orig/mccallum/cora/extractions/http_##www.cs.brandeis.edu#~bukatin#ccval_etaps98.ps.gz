Abstract: The existence of deep connections between partial metrics and valuations is well known in domain theory. However, the treatment of non-algebraic continuous Scott domains has been not quite satisfactory so far. In this paper we return to the continuous normalized valuations on the systems of open sets and introduce notions of co-continuity (fU i ; i 2 Ig is a filtered system of open sets ) (Int( and strong non-degeneracy (U V are open sets ) (U ) &lt; (V )) for such valuations. We call the resulting class of valuations CC-valuations. The first central result of this paper is a construction of CC-valuations for Scott topologies on all continuous dcpo's with countable bases. This is a surprising result because neither co-continuous, nor strongly nondegenerate valuations are usually possible for ordinary Hausdorff topologies. Another central result is a new construction of partial metrics. Given a continuous Scott domain A and a CC-valuation on the system of Scott open subsets of A, we construct a continuous partial metric on A yielding the Scott topology as u(x; y) = (A n (C x " C y )) (I x " I y ), where C x = fy 2 A j y v xg and I x = fy 2 A j fx; yg is unboundedg. This construction covers important cases based on the real line and allows to obtain an induced metric on T otal(A) without the unpleasant restrictions known from earlier work.

Reference-contexts: Keimel also pointed out in [12] that our results are quite surprising, because both co-continuity and strong non-degeneracy, U V are open sets ) (U ) &lt; (V ), seem contradictory, as neither of them can hold for the system of open sets of the ordinary Hausdorff topology on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. However, if we replace the system of open sets of this Hausdorff topology with the system of open intervals, both conditions would hold. <p> Thus, it is possible to consider co-continuity as a method of dealing with non-discreteness of Scott topology. We follow here the remarkable definition of a discrete topology given by Alexandrov: a topology is discrete if an intersection of arbitrary family of open sets is open (e.g. see <ref> [1] </ref>). Of course, if one assumes the T 1 separation axiom, then the Alexandrov's definition implies that all sets are open | the trivial (and more standard) version of the definition. In this sense, Alexandrov topology of upwardly closed sets is discrete, but Scott topology is not. <p> Correspondingly, the border of B in the Scott topology, B n Int (B) = fy 2 B j :(9x 2 B: x t y)g 3.2 A Vertical Segment of Real Line Consider the segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, v=. Define ((x; 1]) = 1 x. Unfortunately, to ensure strong non-degeneracy we have to define ([0; 1]) = 1 + *, * &gt; 0. This is the first hint that strong non-degeneracy is too strong in many cases. <p> We observe, that for every such pair we can construct a special kind of vertical chain, which "behaves like a vertical segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of real line". We call such chain a stick. We assign weights, v (k 0 ; k 00 ) &gt; 0, to sticks as well, in such a way that the sum of all w (k) and all v (k 0 ; k 00 ) is 1. <p> As in Subsection 3.1, compact elements k contribute w (k) to (U ), if k 2 U . An intersection of the stick, associated with a continuously connected pair (k 0 ; k 00 ), with an open set U "behaves as either (q; 1] or <ref> [q; 1] </ref>", where q 2 [0; 1]. Such stick contributes (1 q) v (k 0 ; k 00 ) to (U ). The resulting is the desired CC-valuation. <p> An intersection of the stick, associated with a continuously connected pair (k 0 ; k 00 ), with an open set U "behaves as either (q; 1] or [q; 1]", where q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Such stick contributes (1 q) v (k 0 ; k 00 ) to (U ). The resulting is the desired CC-valuation. It is possible to associate a complete lattice homomorphism from the lattice of Scott open sets to [0; 1] with every compact element and with every stick defined <p> as either (q; 1] or [q; 1]", where q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Such stick contributes (1 q) v (k 0 ; k 00 ) to (U ). The resulting is the desired CC-valuation. It is possible to associate a complete lattice homomorphism from the lattice of Scott open sets to [0; 1] with every compact element and with every stick defined by basic continuously connected elements, k 0 and k 00 . Then, as suggested by Keimel [12], all these homomorphisms together can be thought of as an in-jective complete lattice homomorphism to [0; 1] J . <p> the lattice of Scott open sets to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with every compact element and with every stick defined by basic continuously connected elements, k 0 and k 00 .

From this point of view, our construction of is the same as in [12]. <p> Whenever we have an upwardly closed (i.e. Alexandrov open) set U , for any stick fa k 0 ;k 00 r j r 2 (0; 1)g there is a number q k 0 ;k 00 U 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, such that r &lt; q k 0 ;k 00 U ) r 62 U and q U &lt; r ) a k 0 ;k 00 r 2 U . <p> Definition 6.1.

(Info AXIOMS) (a) <p> Also the reliance on countable systems of finite weights excludes such natural partial metrics as metric u : R [0;1] fi R [0;1] !

Now we consider several valuations and distances on the domain of interval numbers located within the segment [0; 1]. This domain can be thought of as a triangle of pairs hx; yi, 0 x y 1. <p> Partial metrics generated by strongly non-degenerate valuations contain quadratic expressions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently the theory of partial metrics introduced by Matthews [14] undergoes active development and is used in various applications from computational description of metric spaces [9] to the analysis of parallel computation [13].

Consider a continuous dcpo A with a countable basis K. Assign a converging system of weights to basic elements: w (k) &gt; 0, P k2K w (k) = 1. Define (U ) = P k2U w (k). <p> k 0 of basic elements, such that k t k 0 , instead of considering just continuously connected pairs and compact elements. 5 Partial and Relaxed Metrics on Domains The motivations behind the notion of relaxed metric, its computational meaning and its relationships with partial metrics [14] were explained in <ref> [3] </ref>. Here we focus on the definitions and basic properties, revisit the issue of specific axioms of partial metrics, and list the relevant open problems. The distance domain consists of pairs ha; bi (also denoted as [a; b]) of non-negative reals (+1 included), such that a b. <p> We include the stronger form in the definition of partial metrics for the purposes of this paper. Section 8.1 of <ref> [3] </ref> discusses the issue of whether axioms u (x; x) u (x; y) and u (x; z) u (x; y) + u (y; z) u (y; y) should hold for the upper bounds of relaxed metrics. <p> utilitarian value of these axioms can be found in [4]. 6 Partial and Relaxed Metrics via Information 6.1 Info-structures Some of the earlier known constructions of partial metrics can be understood via the mechanism of common information between elements x and y bringing negative contribution to u (x; y) (see <ref> [3, Section 8] </ref>). This can be further formalized as follows. Assume that there is a set I representing information about elements of a dcpo A. We choose a ring, M (I), of admissible subsets of I and introduce a measure-like structure, , on M (I). <p> The nature of these set-theoretical representations, I, of domains may vary: one can consider sets of tokens of information systems, powersets of domain bases, or powersets of domains themselves, custom-made sets for specific domains, etc. The approach via powersets of domain bases (see <ref> [3] </ref>) can be thought of as a partial case of the approach via powersets of domains themselves adopted in the present paper. 6.2 Partial and Relaxed Metrics via Inf o-structures Define the (upper estimate of the) distance between x and y from A as u : A fi A ! R <p> Then we can introduce the lower estimate of the distance l : A fi A ! R + : l (x; y) = (Info (x) " Neginfo (y)) + (Info (y) " Neginfo (x)): The proof of Lemma 9 of <ref> [3] </ref> is directly applicable and yields l (x; y) u (x; y). Thus we can form an induced relaxed metric, : A fi A ! R I , = hl; ui, with a meaningful lower bound. <p> Theorem 6.1 Function u is a partial metric. Function is a continuous relaxed metric. The relaxed metric topology coincides with the Scott topology. Due to the axiom 8x 2 T otal (A): Info (x) [ Neginfo (x) = I, the proof of Lemma 10 of <ref> [3] </ref> would go through, yielding x; y 2 T otal (A) ) l (x; y) = u (x; y) and allowing to obtain the following theorem (cf. Theorem 8 of [3]). Theorem 6.2 For all x and y from T otal (A), l (x; y) = u (x; y). <p> the axiom 8x 2 T otal (A): Info (x) [ Neginfo (x) = I, the proof of Lemma 10 of <ref> [3] </ref> would go through, yielding x; y 2 T otal (A) ) l (x; y) = u (x; y) and allowing to obtain the following theorem (cf. Theorem 8 of [3]). Theorem 6.2 For all x and y from T otal (A), l (x; y) = u (x; y). Consider d : T otal (A) fi T otal (A) ! R, d (x; y) = l (x; y) = u (x; y). <p> Consider d : T otal (A) fi T otal (A) ! R, d (x; y) = l (x; y) = u (x; y). Then (T otal (A); d) is a metric space, and its metric topology is the subspace topology induced by the Scott topology on A. However, in <ref> [3] </ref> x 2 T otal (A) ) Info (x) [ Neginfo (x) = I holds under an awkward condition, the regularity of the basis. While bases of algebraic Scott domains and of continuous lattices can be made regular, there are important continuous Scott domains, which cannot be given regular bases. <p> it still might be fruitful to consider replacing the axiom 8x 2 T otal (A): Info (x) [ Neginfo (x) = I by something like 8x 2 T otal (A): (I n (Info (x) [ Neginfo (x))) = 0. 6.3 A Previously Known Construction Here we recall a construction from <ref> [3] </ref> based on a generally non-co-continuous valuation of Subsection 3.1. We will reformulate it in our terms of Info-structures. In [3] it was natural to think that I = K. <p> = I by something like 8x 2 T otal (A): (I n (Info (x) [ Neginfo (x))) = 0. 6.3 A Previously Known Construction Here we recall a construction from <ref> [3] </ref> based on a generally non-co-continuous valuation of Subsection 3.1. We will reformulate it in our terms of Info-structures. In [3] it was natural to think that I = K. Here we reformulate that construction in terms of I = A, thus abandoning the condition x 2 T otal (A) ) Info (x) [ Neginfo (x) = I altogether. <p> Define I x = fy 2 A j fx; yg is unboundedg, P x = fy 2 A j y t xg (cf. I x = fk 2 K j fk; xg is unboundedg, K x = fk 2 K j k t xg in <ref> [3] </ref>). Define Info (x) = P x , Neginfo (x) = I x . <p> Observe also that since the construction in Section 3.1 does form a CC valuation for algebraic Scott domains with bases of compact elements, the construction in <ref> [3] </ref> can be considered as a partial case of our current construction if the basis does not contain non-compact elements. Lemma 6.1 Assume that is a co-continuous valuation and B is a directed subset of A.

Reference-contexts: It seems that the notion of co-continuity of valuations and this result for the case of continuous Scott domains with countable bases are both new and belong to us. The generalization of this result to continuous dcpo's with countable bases belongs to Klaus Keimel <ref> [12] </ref>. He worked directly with completely distributive lattices of Scott open sets of continuous dcpo's and used the results about completely distributive lattices obtained by Raney in the fifties (see Exercise 2.30 on page 204 of [8]). <p> This proof also works for all continuous dcpo's with countable bases. A part of this proof, as predicted by Keimel, can be considered as a special case of Raney's results mentioned above. However, our construction is very simple and self-contained. Keimel also pointed out in <ref> [12] </ref> that our results are quite surprising, because both co-continuity and strong non-degeneracy, U V are open sets ) (U ) &lt; (V ), seem contradictory, as neither of them can hold for the system of open sets of the ordinary Hausdorff topology on [0; 1]. <p> It is possible to associate a complete lattice homomorphism from the lattice of Scott open sets to [0; 1] with every compact element and with every stick defined by basic continuously connected elements, k 0 and k 00 .

Thus the discourse in this section yields the proof of the following: Theorem 4.1 For any continuous dcpo A with a countable basis, there is a CC-valuation on the system of its Scott open sets. 4.1 Continuous Connectivity and Sticks Definition 4.1.

Reference-contexts: In terms of lattice theory, is a (normalized) valuation on a lattice M (I). The consideration of unbounded measures is beyond the scope of this paper, and (I) = 1 is assumed for convenience. Axioms relating v and Info are in the spirit of information systems <ref> [17] </ref>, although we are not considering any inference structure over I in this paper. The requirements for negative information are relatively weak, because it is quite natural to have 8x 2 A: Neginfo (x) = ; if A has a top element.

Reference-contexts: The theory of valuations on open sets underwent a considerable development recently (see <ref> [5, 11, 18, 2] </ref> and references therein). However we have found that we need a special condition of co-continuity for our valuations | for a filtered system of open sets fU i ; i 2 Ig, (Int ( i2I U i )) = inf i2I ((U i )).
