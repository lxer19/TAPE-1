Abstract: Our effort is to construct a Knowledge Aided Design (KAD) system, which aims at supporting concurrent engineering design and improving cooperation and coordination among design engineers. The KAD system centers on a knowledge network that stores design knowledge and provides services for the management of shared design, and a WWW user interface for knowledge access and acquisition. The knowledge network consists of a core enterprise object model with basic representations to various design knowledge, and several layers built around the object model providing constraint management, version management, query management, design management, and access management services.

Reference-contexts: Each one of these perspectives puts forward some criteria (or constraints) that the design must satisfy. Not only these perspectives impose constraints on the design, they also try to push forward their concerns ahead of that of the others <ref> [1] </ref>. The constraints imposed by one perspective may interfere with that imposed by another perspective. When this happens, conicts arise. Design can therefore, be looked as an active network of constraints and parameters.

Reference-contexts: Ease the access to and acquisition of information and knowledge from the representation. Acquiring design information/decisions is difficult due to the barriers existing between engineers and computers. In a study we conducted in Spar and reported in <ref> [2] </ref>, it is found that engineers spend a large portion of their valuable time in searching relevant information, and in most of the cases the engineers cannot get the information that they need to do their jobs.

Reference-contexts: In the next few sections we will describe each layer of the knowledge network in detail. 3 Enterprise Object Model The core of Knowledge Network is an enterprise object model developed within the context of TOVE (TOr-onto Virtual Enterprise) project <ref> [3] </ref>, which aims at constructing generic and re-usable ontologies for modeling the business operation of enterprises. An ontology is an object class library where objects, attributes and relations are precisely defined whenever possible using First-Order Logic.

Reference-contexts: Through reasoning about activity and states, the object model allows us to formalize the process of resource management, scheduling, product manufacturing and many other tasks within design and the operation of an enterprise. The activity and other ontologies have been reported elsewhere, e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 Constraint Management Constraints play an important role in design. It has been widely accepted that design is constraint oriented. To design means, to find a set of values for the attributes that do not violate any of the constraints.

Reference-contexts: In either case, conditions can be imposed to locate proper information to update. In addition, the service of updating a rule is provided. Updating rules is more complex and problematic than querying and updating facts in the knowledge base <ref> [5] </ref>. As an example, suppose we want to insert C into a knowledge base containing A, B and A B C, then it is not clear which piece of information (A, B or A B C) should be given up to keep the knowledge base consistent.

Reference-contexts: To design means, to find a set of values for the attributes that do not violate any of the constraints. The design process involves the recognition, formulation, and satisfaction of constraints. Constraints are continuously being added, modified, and deleted throughout the development of a new product <ref> [6] </ref>. In case of a concurrent engineering environment the design is being simultaneously considered from various life-cycle aspects (or perspectives). Each one of these perspectives puts forward some criteria (or constraints) that the design must satisfy.
