Abstract: We investigate the lower bounds of queries required by the polynomial time Turing reductions from exponential time classes to the sets of small density. For complexity classes E= DTIME(2 O(n) ) and EXP=DTIME(2 n O(1) ), the following results are shown in this paper. (1) For any a &lt; 1, every EXP- P log n )T (TALLY). Our result substantially improve Watanabe's earlier theorem: E6P log ntt (SPARSE) [Wa87,HOW92]. 1.Introduction The study of the density of hard sets for complexity classes has long history. Berman and Hartmanis[BH77] conjectured that all NP- P m -complete sets are isomorphic. Since all of the known NP- P m -complete sets are exponentially dense, they proposed a weaker conjecture that all NP- P m -hard set is sparse unless P=NP. Great efforts has gone into extending Mahaney's result to weaker reductions. Ogiwara and Watanabe[OW91] proved that no NP- P btt -hard set is sparse unless P=NP. That all NP- P m -complete sets are not sparse implies P6=NP. The study of the density of hard sets for NP always need some assumption (such as, P6=NP). On the other hand, absolute results can be obtained about the density of hard sets for exponential-time classes. In [BH77], Berman and Hartmanis showed that no E- P m -hard set can be sparse. Watanabe[Wa87] strengthed this result to P used to show that E6 P log ntt (SPARSE). Separating a complexity class from polynomial size circuit is one of the fundamental problems in complexity theory. Many people have made great efforts in this direction. It is unknown whether NEXP is computable in polynomial size circuit. The class of languages computable by polynomial size circuit is the same as the class of languages to be polynomial time Turing reducible to sparse sets (the class P T (SPARSE)). It is generally conjectured that EXP6 P T (SPARSE) (equivalently, that EXP does not have polynomial-size circuits). Karp and Lipton[KL80] showed that if EXP P T (SPARSE) then EXP= p 2 . Wilson[Wi85] constructed an oracle A such that NEXP P T (SPARSE) holds relative to A. So, it is impossible to separate EXP from P T (SPARSE) by relativizable techniques. In this paper, we show that for any a &lt; 1, every EXP- P n a T -hard set is exponentially 1 m -complete sets are not sparse. Culminating considerable previous works, Mahaney[M82] proved that no NP- P

Reference-contexts: We show that for any a &lt; 1 2 , every E- P n a T -hard set is exponentially dense. Sparse languages and tally languages are closely related. It is well known that P T (SPARSE) = P tt (TALLY) <ref> [BK88] </ref>. We also constructed a sparse set A in E such that A is P o ( n log n )T (TALLY)- immune. <p> For functions f; g : N ! N , we say f (n) is o (g (n)) if for every c &gt; 0, f (n) &lt; cg (n) for all large n. Book and Ko <ref> [BK88] </ref> showed that P T (SPARSE)= P T (TALLY). Theorem 3.1 says that each sparse set is not EXP- P n a T -hard for all a &lt; 1. For tally sets a better lower bound than n a (a &lt; 1) will be obtained in the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we show that for any a &lt; 1, every EXP- P n a T -hard set is exponentially 1 dense. This yields EXP6 P n a T (SARSE) for all a &lt; 1. Although P m -hardness for EXP is equivalent to that for E <ref> [GH89 ] </ref>, it seems not true for P n a T -hardness with a &lt; 1. We show that for any a &lt; 1 2 , every E- P n a T -hard set is exponentially dense. Sparse languages and tally languages are closely related.

Reference-contexts: We will construct a set A in DTIME (2 n 2+ 9 k+1 )" P ctt (SPARSE) such that A 2P n 1 1 (S) implies that S is exponentially dense. In these two paragraphs, we give an informal overview of the proof. Some ideas in <ref> [GW91] </ref> are involved in the construction of set A. Set A will be built to be exponentially dense. Each string in A is hard to compress, and also it is hard to describe relative to other strings in A.

Reference-contexts: If there exists a polynomial p (n) such that k A n k&lt; p (n) for all n, then we say A is sparse. "SPARSE" represents the class of all sparse languages. "TALLY" represents the class of all languages T with T f0g fl . Hartmanis <ref> [H83] </ref> introduced a "generalized Kolmogorov complexity measure". We employ this tool in the proof of our theorems. We consider standard deterministic time- bounded Turing machines that act as trans 2 ducers. We assume a standard enumeration of such transducers, say N 1 ; N 2 ; . <p> We have the following fact.
