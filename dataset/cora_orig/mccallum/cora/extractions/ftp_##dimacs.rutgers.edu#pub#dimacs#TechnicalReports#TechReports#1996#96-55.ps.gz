Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Consider an art gallery (i.e., compact set) X of Lebesgue measure 1 in IR d ; d 2, such that a guard placed anywhere in the gallery sees a region of Lebesgue measure at least ". Kavraki, Latombe, Motwani, and Raghavan <ref> [KLMR] </ref> conjectured that if X has at most h holes then it can be guarded by at most f d (h; ") guards, for some function f d polynomial in h and 1 " . <p> A motivation for the problem coming from the robot path planning can be found in <ref> [KLMR] </ref>. Let X be a set in IR d ; d 2. We say that a point x 2 X sees a point y 2 X in X if the line segment xy is fully contained in X.
Reference: [Va] <author> P. Valtr. </author> <title> Guarding galleries where no point sees a small area, to appear in Israel J. Math. 1 P is a centerpoint of a compact set X IR d with respect to a locally finite Borel measure if every halfspace in IR d containing P contains a subset of X of measure 1 d+1 (X). The existence of a centerpoint for any compact set X IR d with respect to a locally finite Borel measure follows easily from the existence of a centerpoint for any finite set in IR d with respect to Lebesgue measure (see [Ed]). </title>
Reference-contexts: Kalai and Matousek [KM] proved a weaker form of the planar version of the conjecture (their function f 2 was not polynomial in h). Following some ideas of Kalai and Matousek, the author <ref> [Va] </ref> proved the planar version of the conjecture with f 2 (h; ") = (2 + o (1)) 1 " log 1 " log 2 (h + 2). <p> This is because the proof in <ref> [Va] </ref> for the uniform (Lebesgue) measure doesn't use any specific properties of the uniform measure, and therefore can be applied for any locally finite Borel measure. We now prove Theorems 2 and 3. Proof of Theorems 2 and 3 (i).
