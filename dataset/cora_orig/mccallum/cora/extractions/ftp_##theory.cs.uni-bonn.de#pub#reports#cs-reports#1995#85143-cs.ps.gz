Abstract: We prove an exponential lower bound on the size of (ternary) algebraic decision trees for the MAX Problem of finding maximum of n real numbers. This complements n 1 lower bound (cf. M. O. Rabin [R72]) on the depth of algebraic decision trees for this problem. The method yields also for the first time a lower size bound for a polyhedral decision problem MAX= of testing whether the ith number is the maximum among a list of n real numbers, and gives the first nonlinear size lower bound on algebraic decision trees for the selection problems.

Reference-contexts: The size of an algebraic decision tree characterizes its algebraic tree-program complexity, and in the case of linear and median-tests decision trees it played an important role in establishing lower bounds for various selection problems (cf. <ref> [FG79] </ref>, [Y89]) with MAX being their generic subproblem. As mentioned before the only known size lower bound on algebraic decision trees for the MAX Problem was a linear one.
