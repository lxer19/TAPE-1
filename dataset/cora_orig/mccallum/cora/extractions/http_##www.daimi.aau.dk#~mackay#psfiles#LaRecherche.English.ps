Abstract: Wendy Mackay received her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Management of Technological Innovation. She has managed both software development and research groups at Digital Equipment and most recently managed the multimedia research group at Rank Xerox EuroPARC. Abstract A revolution in computer interface design is changing the way we think about computers. Rather than typing on a keyboard and watching a television monitor, Augmented Reality lets people use familiar, everyday objects in ordinary ways. The difference is that these objects also provide a link into a computer network. Doctors can examine patients while viewing superimposed medical images; children can program their own LEGO constructions; and construction engineers can use ordinary paper engineering drawings to make live video connections to colleagues far away. Rather than immersing people in an artifically-created virtual world, the goal is to augment everyday objects in the physical world by enhancing them with a wealth of digital information and communication capabilities.

Reference-contexts: We were interested in giving supervisors improved access to critical information as well as to each other. Rather than designing yet another unused program for the supervisor's desk computer, we decided to use an augmented reality approach. Ariel <ref> (Mackay et al. 1993) </ref> lets the engineering drawings themselves became the interface to the computer. The supervisor places his drawing in a specified location. Ariel identifies the drawing via a barcode and uses a tiny video camera to capture handwritten notes and the position of a light pen. <p> Carter demonstrated how two-dimensional architectural sketches on paper can be rendered into three dimensions by the computer. Ariel, from the EuroCODE project, lets us add a multimedia dimension to paper by connecting it to a media space and creating sharable multimedia annotations. Video Mosaic <ref> (Mackay and Pagani, 1993) </ref> explored another dimension: time. For example, look at the figure below. In this magazine, the image is static.

Reference-contexts: Worse, they are poorly equiped to bridge the gap between these two overlapping, but separate, worlds. Perhaps it is not surprising that computers have had little or no impact on white collar productivity <ref> (Landauer, 1996) </ref>. 3 Photos: Wendy with Ariel, Closeup of finger on drawing, Projected icon on drawing.
