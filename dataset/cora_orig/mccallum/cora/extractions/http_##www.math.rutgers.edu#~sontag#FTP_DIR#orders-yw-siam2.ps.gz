Abstract: This paper deals with the orders of input/output equations satisfied by nonlinear systems. Such equations represent differential (or difference, in the discrete-time case) relations between high-order derivatives (or shifts, respectively) of input and output signals. It is shown that, under analyticity assumptions, there cannot exist equations of order less than the minimal dimension of any observable realization; this generalizes the known situation in the classical linear case. The results depend on new facts, themselves of considerable interest in control theory, regarding universal inputs for observability in the discrete case, and observation spaces in both the discrete and continuous cases. Included in the paper is also a new and simple self-contained proof of Sussmann's universal input theorem for continuous-time analytic systems.

Reference-contexts: In [26, 39, 4], local i/o equations were derived under nondegeneracy rank conditions, for smooth systems, under observability assumptions.

We also note the very recent work [34], where further results on universal inputs are presented; these results show in particular the existence of inputs which are universal uniformly over the class of all analytic systems. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: This is all that is needed in order to establish the desired results on orders of i/o equations. However, while this journal version was being written, Coron in the paper <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the equality can be strengthenned, so that it holds for all (not merely generic) states (but still generic ). <p> stronger equality can in fact be obtained with essentially the same proof as in [33], we now present the result directly in that form. (Since we are only interested in analytic systems, we can use elementary facts from analytic geometry to present a simpler approach to the problem than in <ref> [5] </ref>; in that reference the techniques of proof are very different, as the focus is on applications to feedback control problems for smooth systems.

Reference-contexts: We say a function fi is a meromorphic function if fi = p q , where p and q are analytic functions defined on M, and q 6 0. (Note that this global definition is different from the local definition usually given, see e.g. <ref> [17] </ref>. It will be enough for our purposes.) For each function ff 2 F , dff is a covector field defined on M. <p> For each finite jet -, B is an analytic subset of N , i.e. a set defined by analytic equalities. As a consequence of the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem (in the form given for instance in Thm. 2.7, Cor. 3 of <ref> [17] </ref>), one knows that analytic subsets of a compact set satisfy a descending chain condition. That is, if A 1 A 2 A l are analytic subsets of a compact set, then there exists some r &gt; 0 such that A j = A r for all j r.

Reference-contexts: The latter are sets of functions on the state space which are obtained by performing different kinds of "experiments" with the system and extracting infinitesimal information from the observed data. The basic fact needed was established in <ref> [40] </ref>, and it related the space obtained by using piecewise constant controls (and derivatives of the output function with respect to switching times between constant pieces) to the space obtained when using instead differentiable inputs (and the corresponding jet of derivatives of the output at time zero). <p> We also let dF be fd (; ) : 2 F g, seen as a space of covector fields. Clearly, for each , F is a subspace of F , and therefore, for each x also dF (x) is a subspace of dF (x). The main result in <ref> [40] </ref> says that F = This equality is fundamental in establishing results linking realizability to the existence of i/o equations, in [41] and [42]. In intuitive but less rigorous terms, the equality in (9) can be interpreted as follows. <p> Note that c i () is a polynomial in , and c i () doesn't depend on j for j i. By Lemma 2.1 in <ref> [40] </ref>, one knows that for a convergent series c, F c [u] = 0 for every piecewise constant input u if and only if c = 0.

Reference-contexts: Such equations, and their discrete-time analogues, are of interest in identification theory, and arise also naturally in the "behavioral" approach to systems (see e.g. <ref> [44] </ref>). They provide a natural generalization of the autoregressive moving-average representations that appear in linear systems theory, where E is linear (in that case, the Laplace transform of the equation leads to the usual transfer function).
