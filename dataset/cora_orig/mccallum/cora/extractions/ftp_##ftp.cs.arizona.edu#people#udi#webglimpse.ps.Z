Abstract: The two paradigms of searching and browsing are currently almost always used separately. One can either look at the library card catalog, or browse the shelves; one can either search large WWW sites (or the whole web), or browse page by page. In this paper we describe a software tool we developed, called WebGlimpse, that combines the two paradigms. It allows the search to be limited to a neighborhood of the current document. WebGlimpse automatically analyzes collections of web pages and computes those neighborhoods (at indexing time). With WebGlimpse users can browse at will, using the same pages; they can also jump from each page, through a search, to ``close-by'' pages related to their needs. In a sense, our combined paradigm allows users to browse using hypertext links that are constructed on the fly through a neighborhood search. The design of WebGlimpse concentrated on four goals: fast search, efficient indexing (both in terms of time and space), flexible facilities for defining neighborhoods, and non-wasteful use of Internet resources. Our implementation was geared towards the World-Wide Web, but the general design is applicable to any large-scale information bases. We believe that the concept of combining browsing and searching is very powerful, and deserves much more attention. Further information about WebGlimpse, including the complete source code, documentations, demos, and examples of use, can be found at http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu/webglimpse/.

Reference-contexts: After all, the computer is the one that is supposed to do most of the work, not you. Some simple facilities of focusing the search while browsing have been employed. We have attempted limited browsing and searching facilities in our GlimpseHTTP package <ref> [1] </ref>. Since the work on GlimpseHTTP has not been published (aside from the code), we describe here some of the features that WebGlimpse borrowed. GlimpseHTTP indexes a UNIX file system, and provides search that can be focused to any part of the directory tree.

Reference-contexts: GlimpseHTTP indexes a UNIX file system, and provides search that can be focused to any part of the directory tree. For example, if you are looking for a Computer Science citation (our most popular demo <ref> [2] </ref> of GlimpseHTTP), you can browse one of 16 different categories and perform the search only for the current category. Only one index is needed for the whole archive; the CGI program identifies the page from which the search originates, and limits the search accordingly.

Reference-contexts: But its browsing and searching capabilities do not apply to arbitrary links (or to sites with information that is not neatly organized in a tree structure). GlimpseHTTP has been very successful; it is used in more than 500 sites <ref> [3] </ref>, some quite major. WebGlimpse is a natural extension of GlimpseHTTP, borrowing some of its features but taking them much further. The idea of searching only parts of a hierarchy is now used by Yahoo [4] to search only one category at a time.

This is done in a very similar fashion to GlimpseHTTP, and it suffers from the same problem.

Reference-contexts: But following only one symbolic link from any subcategory would probably have been better. This is the kind of feature that WebGlimpse easily provides. Other web search servers take a different approach. Both InfoSeek <ref> [5] </ref> and Lycos [6] offer ``Find Related Sites.'' The relationship is computed by searching the whole database for keywords similar to the major keywords of the given document.

Reference-contexts: With WebGlimpse we would have to input only `jazz.' Such a query would probably have filtered out the unrelated documents that somehow ended in those neighborhoods. Another example of focusing search to limited domain based on current browsing is the WWW-Entrez system <ref> [7] </ref> from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, which precomputes neighborhoods within the nucleotide database and within the Medline database and presents fixed links from all pages to their neighborhoods.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to define which pages will be selected in a flexible manner. Search Glimpse is used for all the search routines. We'll start with a description of Glimpse, because it serves as the basis for the whole design. 2.2. Glimpse The search engine for WebGlimpse is glimpse <ref> [8] </ref> (which also serves as the default search engine in the Harvest system [9]). For completeness, we'll mention here the features of glimpse that are relevant to the searching/browsing problem. Glimpse is an indexing and search software, designed slightly different than most other indexing systems.

For completeness, we'll mention here the features of glimpse that are relevant to the searching/browsing problem. Glimpse is an indexing and search software, designed slightly different than most other indexing systems. Glimpse's index consists essentially of two parts, the word file and the pointers file. <p> For example, one may decide to exclude from the archive any files in a directory called /private/, except for one file there called ``told-ya.html''. The syntax for exclude/include follows the one used by the Harvest system <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.4. Collecting Remote Pages WebGlimpse provides facilities to collect remote URLs and include them in the indexing and in the search. A neighborhood can therefore include remote URLs, and users may jump through a neighborhood search to remote sites. <p> Applications The main application of WebGlimpse is, of course, to provide search for collections of hypertext files. We foresee several other related applications. 3.1. Building Personal or Topical Collections In a sense, WebGlimpse is a ``light'' version of Harvest <ref> [9] </ref>. It does not have the full power of Harvest to automatically collect massive information from given sites and extract the indexed text from different formats. But it does allow one to collect and organize specific documents that are relevant.

Reference-contexts: The relevant pointers (to the source text) in the pointers file are collected. The second stage is another search, using agrep <ref> [10] </ref>, in the corresponding places in the original text. This is similar in principle to the usual inverted indexes, except that the word file, being one relatively small file, can be searched sequentially.

Reference-contexts: Simple queries with words as patterns and Boolean operators is optimized by using hashing into the word file. Such queries generally take less than a second. More complex searches obviously take more time, but it is worth the extra flexibility. GlimpseHTTP was compared with WAIS <ref> [11] </ref> (independently of us), with the conclusions that ``system requirements, administration and maintenance and, most importantly, user functionality is dramatically better than WAIS for both searching and browsing.'' Glimpse is particularly suitable for our purposes because it supports very flexible ways to limit the search to only parts of the information

Reference-contexts: Like typical caches, this is done completely transparent to the user, and is done for performance purposes only. But having this large set of mostly relevant pages can be very helpful. For example, two years ago we designed a system called Warmlist <ref> [12] </ref> that cached pages per user demand, indexed them, organized them, and provided full text search. It was meant to be a natural extension of the ``hot list'' concept.

Reference-contexts: With WebGlimpse, you can easily construct an archive of your history list. Not only can you browse and search it, but you may also discover relationships between pages by viewing the neighborhoods or other context information. 3.3. Visualization and Custom- ization Combining WebGlimpse with graph drawing packages (such as <ref> [13] </ref> and [14]) will allow for better visualization of the hypertext structure. Imagine adding to the results of queries some summaries of the documents, icons of them, or other useful information of the kind you find in static pages with links to related documents.

Reference-contexts: In other words, you as the navigator can build your own hypertext part of your way, customized to the areas of interest to you. In particular, it would be very interesting to see how to combine our fixed neighborhood search with the ideas of scatter/gather <ref> [15] </ref>, or an automatic classification system like AIM [16]. 4. Conclusions Searching the web is growing quickly from an infancy stage. The current facilities are quite amazing and very useful, but they are far from being the last word or even a good word.
