Abstract: In this paper we use a displacement structure approach to design a class of new precondition-ers for the conjugate gradient method applied to the solution of large Toeplitz linear equations. Explicit formulas are suggested for the G.Strang-type and for the T.Chan-type preconditioners belonging to any of 8 classes of matrices diagonalized by the corresponding discrete cosine or sine transforms. Under the standard Wiener class assumption the clustering property is established for all of these preconditioners, guaranteeing a rapid convergence of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. All the computations related to the new preconditioners can be done in real arithmetic, and to fully exploit this advantageous property one has to suggest a fast real-arithmetic algorithm for multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix by a vector. It turns out that the obtained formulas for the G.Strang-type preconditioners allow a number of representations for Toeplitz matrices leading to a wide variety of real-arithmetic multiplication algorithms based on any of 8 discrete cosine or sine transforms. Recently transformations of Toeplitz matrices to Vandermonde-like or Cauchy-like matrices have been found to be useful in developing accurate direct methods for Toeplitz linear equations. In this paper we suggest to further extend the range of the transformation approach by exploring it for iterative methods; this technique allowed us to reduce the complexity of each iteration of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. We conclude the paper with a suggestion on how to exploit the displacement structure to efficiently organize numerical experiments in a numerically reliable way.

Reference-contexts: This observation allows us to suggest a variety of new O (m log m) real-arithmetic algorithms for the multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix by a vector, using any of 8 versions of discrete cosine or sine transforms. For the DST-I case such an algorithm was suggested earlier in <ref> [BK95] </ref>. 1.5. Transformations. Toeplitz-like matrices display just one kind of displacement structure and the following two displacement operators r (R) = R DRZ T (with a diagonal D) are used to define the classes of Vandermonde-like and Cauchy-like matrices, respectively. <p> Property 6. For all G.Strang-type preconditioners in Table 5 we have that kS Q (A)k 2 and kS Q (A) 1 k 2 are uniformly bounded independently of m. 13 Note that the DST-I-based preconditioner was designed earlier in [BB90] and it was also dis-cussed in <ref> [BK95] </ref> [H95].

Although this is beyong our needs in the present paper, note that the formulas for the G.Strang-type preconditioners allow us to multiply in the same way Toeplitz-plus-Hankel matrices by a vector. These algorithms are analogs of the well-known embedding-into-circulant (complex arithmetic) multiplication algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The above arguments indicate that there is a close connection between finding an optimal Frobenius-norm approximant of a Toeplitz matrix, and transformations of Toeplitz matrices to Cauchy-like matrices. Such transformations were closely studied in several recent papers. For example, in [O93b], [O95] and <ref> [He95b] </ref> direct (i.e., based on the computation on the matrix entries, without explicit use of displacement operators) transformations were considered. Their results can be applied to obtain T.Chan-type preconditioners for the transforms II and III. <p> New transformation formulas (systematically obtained here for all 8 cases) require only one discrete trigonometric transform to compute the diagonal part of a Cauchy-like matrices, as compared to 2 such transforms in [O93b], [O95], <ref> [He95b] </ref>. Furthermore, 23 the concept of partially reconstructible matrices suggested to use the definition of r H Q -generator, given in [KO95a]. This allowed us to obtain a unified descriptions for the both G.Strang-type and T.Chan-type preconditioners, given in Tables 10 and 9, resp.

Reference-contexts: There is a number of fast Toeplitz solvers all taking advantage of the structure (1.1) to significantly reduce the number of operations. For example, the classical Schur and Levinson algorithms, see, e.g., <ref> [K87] </ref>, and references therein, each requires only O (m 2 ) operations per system. Moreover the there are even super-fast Toeplitz solvers with a smaller complexity of O (m log 2 m) operations.
