Abstract: Multimedia applications are Quality of Service (QoS) sensitive, which makes QoS support indispensable in high speed Integrated Services Packet Networks (ISPN). An important aspect is QoS routing, namely, the provision of QoS routes at session set up time based on user request and information about available network resources. This paper develops optimal QoS routing algorithms within an Autonomous System (AS). Previous approaches have been based either on minimizing a single metric (delay, for instance) or a combination of multiple metrics, optimizing one at a time, in a hierarchical fashion. Our approach finds minimum hop paths which satisfy multiple QoS constraints. We argue that a QoS version of the Bellman-Ford routing algorithm provides the best strategy for QoS routing problems of a given type. We show that Bellman-Ford is very powerful in solving most multiple constrained routing problems arising in a flat network (within an autonomous system), if the minimum hop is the main objective function. We further illustrate the importance of Bellman-Ford QoS routing algorithms with regard to network utilization and session blocking through simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: In a regular BF algorithm, it is well known that: Theorem 1 <ref> (Bertsekas et al. 1992) </ref> D h i is non-increasing with h, regardless of the cost metric d used. Essentially, the non-increasing property of the distance D h is provided by the min operator of eq. (8). <p> It is worth noting that the Bellman-Ford algorithm has a worst case complexity of O (N 3 ) <ref> (Bertsekas et al. 1992) </ref>, which is higher than the Dijkstra algorithm complexity of O (N log N ). However, the regular Dijkstra does not classify the paths it generates on the basis of hop count, as BF algorithm does.

Reference-contexts: This task translates into finding routes in a network scenario of multiple metrics. In general, routing optimally a flow with such end-to-end constraints (multiple metrics) is known to be an NP-complete problem <ref> (Garey et al. 1979) </ref>. Recent papers have addressed the QoS constrained routing problem using a variety of strategies. <p> Therefore, an optimal path is generally defined as a path with minimum number of hops which still satisfies a given set of metric (upper/lower) bounds. 2.1 Related work The most general shortest path problem with multiple constraints is known to be NP-Complete <ref> (Garey et al. 1979) </ref>. Recent research in the solution of Bellman's Equations with multiattributes (Henig 1994) establishes some conditions on the set of vectors of path values so that an order of preference among the possible paths can be defined, and thus a solution obtained.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for a given QoS connection with buffer requirement &gt; B, a good strategy is to eliminate all links without the minimum buffer storage. The path cost definition for buffers assumes a uniform buffer requirement along all routers of a given path. Recent scheduling disciplines <ref> (Georgiadis et al. 1996) </ref> imply buffer allocation which grows linearly with the hop count. <p> This is essentially because propagation delays are assumed constant within an AS, which makes delay jitter dependent on the scheduling and service disciplines exercised by the router. For deterministic jitter bounds, the same values are expected to be advertised for a given traffic class <ref> (Georgiadis et al. 1996) </ref> (Zhang 1995). In this case, the dependency of the distance J h D with the number of hops is linear, thus similar to the distance L h D shown above.

Reference-contexts: Recent papers have addressed the QoS constrained routing problem using a variety of strategies. Some researchers have proposed approximate solutions based on minimizing a single objective function at a time (i.e., defining a hierarchy of metrics) <ref> (Guerin et al. 1997a) </ref> for a generic multiple metric routing problem. Others have succeeded in reducing the problem complexity to a polynomial degree by assuming a particular scheduling discipline and traffic shaping policy at each router ((Pornavalai et al. 1997) (Zhao et al. 1997)). <p> In considering routing with multiple constraints, it has been noticed that the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm can potentially solve a two metric routing problem, when one of the metrics is the hop count <ref> (Guerin et al. 1997a) </ref>. This fact favors the Bellman-Ford algorithm when compared with the Dijkstra algorithm, which lacks this capability. This is because Dijkstra algorithm does not search for a minimum path cost in ascending order of number of hops, as Bellman-Ford does. <p> then, solutions for multiple constrained routing problems have been reduced to either the minimization of a single cost metric and the verification that the path computed satisfies the required bounds (Lee at al. 1997); or the definition of a hierarchy of cost functions, to be optimized one at a time <ref> (Guerin et al. 1997a) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our figure of merit is session acceptance probability, which is evaluated for various network loads. We assume each session has specified QoS bounds on the metrics considered, possibly conveyed by RSVP signalling upon entering the Autonomous System (AS) cloud <ref> (Guerin et al. 1997b) </ref>. Although a session may traverse several ASs, where each AS requires a QoS routing solution of its own, we consider a single AS only.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in the solution of Bellman's Equations with multiattributes <ref> (Henig 1994) </ref> establishes some conditions on the set of vectors of path values so that an order of preference among the possible paths can be defined, and thus a solution obtained. In general, however, the checking of those conditions on a particular instance of the problem takes exponential time. (Henig 1994) <p> multiattributes <ref> (Henig 1994) </ref> establishes some conditions on the set of vectors of path values so that an order of preference among the possible paths can be defined, and thus a solution obtained. In general, however, the checking of those conditions on a particular instance of the problem takes exponential time. (Henig 1994) also shows that, for a given class of multiattribute shortest path problems, a polynomial solution is available. Our work addresses a small sub-class of the above mentioned class. (Wang et al. 1995) first modelled the QoS routing problem as a multiple metric shortest path problem. <p> One more observation is due. For a generic metric, the verification whether a given distance has non-increasing/non-decreasing property might take exponential time (see <ref> (Henig 1994) </ref> for further discussions on this issue). However, this property is called upon only when the multiple metric BF algorithm fails to find a path, to claim that the problem has no solution. <p> We have considered uniform link values for these metrics because we can easily check the non-decreasing distances property with the number of hops. For a generic metric, however, this checking takes exponential time (see <ref> (Henig 1994) </ref> for further discussions on this issue). For generic loss probability and delay jitter metrics, one can still use the multiple metric Bellman-Ford algorithm defined in the previous section. <p> The class of multiple metrics considered in this document is still a bit restrictive. <ref> (Henig 1994) </ref>, among others, has shown that a large class of multiattribute shortest path problems can be solved efficiently. The question whether this large class includes any routing problem of interest for QoS applications in multimedia high speed packet networks is an important research topic.

Reference-contexts: However, they make no assumptions about the multiple metrics when deriving the impossibility results. Since then, solutions for multiple constrained routing problems have been reduced to either the minimization of a single cost metric and the verification that the path computed satisfies the required bounds <ref> (Lee at al. 1997) </ref>; or the definition of a hierarchy of cost functions, to be optimized one at a time (Guerin et al. 1997a).

Reference-contexts: Buffer In general, the amount of buffers allocated to a given session is expected to be related to the bounds on loss probability and delay guaranteed by the router. Buffer requirements per node, thus, depend on the scheduling and service disciplines exercised by the router (see <ref> (Zhang 1995) </ref> for a survey on relevant service disciplines for deterministic delay bounds). If a given session needs a specific amount of buffers for reasons other than loss bounds (e.g., delay bounds provided by some scheduling discipline (Zhang 1995)), we can use definition 3 for buffer path cost. <p> thus, depend on the scheduling and service disciplines exercised by the router (see <ref> (Zhang 1995) </ref> for a survey on relevant service disciplines for deterministic delay bounds). If a given session needs a specific amount of buffers for reasons other than loss bounds (e.g., delay bounds provided by some scheduling discipline (Zhang 1995)), we can use definition 3 for buffer path cost. According to definition 3, it is easy to see that a distance B h i has the same dependance on the number of hops as for the bandwidth case described above. <p> This is essentially because propagation delays are assumed constant within an AS, which makes delay jitter dependent on the scheduling and service disciplines exercised by the router. For deterministic jitter bounds, the same values are expected to be advertised for a given traffic class (Georgiadis et al. 1996) <ref> (Zhang 1995) </ref>. In this case, the dependency of the distance J h D with the number of hops is linear, thus similar to the distance L h D shown above. Delay With regard to hop delays, a delay metric d (i; j) will have various values for different links.
