Abstract: The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. Belief revision and update are clearly not the only possible notions of belief change. In this paper we investigate properties of a range of possible belief change operations. We start with an abstract notion of a belief change system and provide a logical language that describes belief change in such systems. We then consider several reasonable properties one can impose on such systems and characterize them axiomatically. We show that both belief revision and update fit into our classification. As a consequence, we get both a semantic and an axiomatic (proof-theoretic) characterization of belief revision and update (as well as some belief change operations that generalize them), in one natural framework.

In the full paper we show that these constraints can be easily axiomatized in our language, thus providing a proof system for iterated belief revision.

Reference-contexts: in epistemic state s exactly if is true in all the minimal worlds that satisfy ' (according to the preference ordering at s). 1 1 We note that there is some confusion in the literature between the Ramsey conditional (i.e., &gt;) and preference conditional that describes the agent preferences (see <ref> (Boutilier 1992) </ref> for example). There is a strong connection between the two in preferential BCS's, but even in that context they have different properties.

Reference-contexts: Ranked BCS's can be characterized by the following axiom: PR. ((' 1 _ ' 2 )&gt;B:' 2 ) ) ((' 2 _ )&gt;B:' 2 ) _ ((' 1 _ Axiom PR is an analogue of a standard axiom of conditional logic that captures the ranking condition <ref> (Burgess 1981) </ref>. We must restrict the axiom here to L-beliefs, whereas the corresponding axiom in conditional logic need not be restricted.

Reference-contexts: We use a logical language we call L &gt; to reason about BCS's.

See also <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1994b) </ref>. L &gt; augments L with a unary modal operator B and a binary modal operator &gt; to capture belief change.

Reference-contexts: fact, this is done in (Friedman & Halpern 1994a; 1994b), where we examine a broader framework that models both the agent and world and allows us to evaluate objective and subjective formulas.) We could have also interpreted a formula ' 2 L to mean the agent believes ' (as in <ref> (G ardenfors 1978) </ref>), but it turns out to be technically more convenient to add the B operator, since it lets us distinguish between the agent believing :' and the agent not believing '. <p> The following result shows that AX does indeed characterize belief change. Theorem 3: AX is a sound and complete axiomatization of L &gt; with respect to M. It is interesting to compare our axiomatization with the system CM discussed in <ref> (G ardenfors 1978) </ref>. All of his axioms are sound in our framework. We have some extra axioms due to the fact that our language includes a B operator, but this could be easily added to G ardenfors' framework as well.

Reference-contexts: Because we restrict to belief sets in L and revise only by formulas in L, we avoid the triviality problem that occurs when applying the AGM postulates to conditional beliefs <ref> (G ardenfors 1986) </ref> or to nested beliefs (Levi 1988; Fuhrmann 1989). We remark that this approach to dealing with the triviality problem is in the spirit of suggestions made earlier (Levi 1988; Rott 1989; Boutilier 1992).
