Abstract: Effectively distributing information to members of a large organization poses a number of challenges. Ideal information distribution within an organization will be timely, selective, and (to some degree) automatic. It is difficult to meet all three of these criteria simultaneously using existing techniques in information retrieval and information filtering. This paper introduces a new method of distributing information automatically, based on enterprise models representations of the pertinent aspects of an organization's structure and operation. The approach is based on the premise that often information needs within an organization are implicitly represented by paths through the enterprise model. These paths are discovered in our approach through the use of Generalized Path Models (GPMs). A GPM specifies (1) the conditions that instigate a path search when new information is created, (2) a general class of paths for which to search, and (3) an action to take when a suitable path is found. The approach has been implemented in a software module called IDIST, an extension to a large commercial enterprise modelling tool.

Reference-contexts: The result is unnecessary work, duplicated work, and generally lower productivity. Researchers in a number of fields have begun developing technology that addresses some of the difficulties mentioned above. Systems that perform information filtering (e.g., <ref> [BC92, YGM95] </ref>) allow the user to automatically receive information distributed by the system based on the user's interests, which are generally provided by the user in the form of a profile.

Reference-contexts: Second, regardless of how much general information distribution knowledge IDIST has, inevitably an organization would need to tailor its distribution system to deal with the specific information needs of the organization. 5 Related Work and Issues Much previous and current research in information push, information filtering, and information agents (e.g., <ref> [Cal96, YGM95, SPWl + 96] </ref>) assumes the existence of a user-created profile or long-term query, and focuses on techniques for effectively matching documents to that profile or query.

The goal of enterprise modelling research is exactly to represent corporate knowledge like that in (1). (Requirement (2), heuristics that capture relevance in terms of objects in the enterprise model, are the research focus of this project; these are discussed in the next section.) Fraser <ref> [Fra94] </ref> defines enterprise modelling as the activity of enabling, among other things, capture and description of all relevant aspects of an enterprise (e.g., its processes, strategy, organisational structure, resources, goals, constraints, and environment).

Reference-contexts: IDIST attempts to deduce the user's information needs implicitly contained in the enterprise model. Another approach, adopted by researchers in intelligent agents, is to have an agent that learns the user's interests through interaction with the user <ref> [Mae94] </ref>. This approach puts little up front burden on the user and organization to create structures representing user interests (profiles or enterprise models).

Reference-contexts: It triggers when a (text) functional description of a proposed tool is created in the enterprise model, and it searches for other implemented tools whose text description is similar (using the vector space model <ref> [SM83] </ref> to determine similarity). This GPM shows how arbitrary functions (e.g., IS SIMILAR? in Figure 2 (c)) can be attached to finite state machine transitions. 4 IDIST We have implemented the GPM-based information distribution method in a software module called IDIST.
