Affiliation: School of Psychology Georgia Institute of Technology  
Date: July, 1994  
Abstract: Acknowledgments: I would like to thank Paul Thagard for providing me with the Macintosh implementation of ECHO, Dave Rettinger for providing me with reprints of most of the Story Model work, and Nancy Nersessian for getting me started on this project. I would also like to gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science foundation through its Graduate Fellowship program.

Reference-contexts: While jurors differ from one another in terms of their representations of the verdicts, this does not play a central role, as differences in verdict representations are not associated with differences in decision outcomes <ref> (Pennington & Hastie, 1986) </ref>. (3) Story Classification , in which the story constructed in step 1 is matched to the verdicts represented in step 2. The central element here is the goodness of fit between the story and the various verdicts. <p> The verdict categories of action, mental states, and circumstances <ref> (taken from Pennington and Hastie, 1986) </ref> yielded 18 propositions and 7 explanations or contradictions. Linking the verdict categories and the final verdicts required four explanations and one contradiction. The four possible final verdicts generated four propositions.

Reference-contexts: One of the reasons for the success of the Story Model is that other, more traditional decision models have difficulty modeling human decisions under such conditions <ref> (Pennington &Hastie, 1992 ) </ref>. <p> The Story Model maintains that jurors arrive at decisions as the result of a threestage process: (1) Story Construction, an active, constructive comprehension process in which they make sense of trial information by attempting to organize it into a coherent mental representation <ref> (Pennington &Hastie, 1992, p. 190) </ref>. These representations typically take the form of stories with causal links between episodes in the story. It is possible for jurors to construct more than one story, and in that case stories are judged on the basis of their acceptability. <p> As it stands, the Story Model is more an account than a predictive model <ref> (but see Pennington &Hastie, 1992) </ref>. Jurors stories are noted to be consistent with the verdict categories after the final verdict from each juror is known. Because coherence, completeness, and uniqueness are not formally defined in the Story Model, multiple interpretations of any given story are possible.

Reference-contexts: Most closely related to the present issue, ECHO has been used to model prominent jury verdicts <ref> (Thagard, 1989) </ref>, though not the decisions of individual jurors. page 2 One of the criticisms that has been raised (e.g.

Reference-contexts: TEC and ECHO have been used to provide a mechanism that can lead people to abandon an old conceptual system and accept a new one <ref> (Thagard, 1992a, p. 62) </ref>. page 1 In TEC, explain is taken to be a primitive relation between propositions (P, Q, and P 1 . . P n ) in an explanatory scheme (S).

Reference-contexts: scientific revolutions such as the Copernican revolution (Nowak &Thagard, 1992 ; Thagard, 1992a) as well as various complex decisions, such as Hitlers belief the Allies would invade Calais rather than Normandy and the decision of the captain of the USS Vincennes which led to the destruction of a passenger aircraft <ref> (Thagard, 1992b) </ref>.
