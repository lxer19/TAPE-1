Abstract: For collaboration transparency this can cause resource mapping problems. For example if our conference includes several 24 and 8 bit plane displays and one 1 bit (black & white) display, what display type do we tell the application it is connected to? Assuming the lowest common denominator causes the least mapping problems, but may prove too restrictive for some applications. Worse still, what do we do if the user of the 1 bit display joins the conference part way through? The only good course of action is for the user who starts the application to decide depending on the application and the expected user (and hence hardware) group. In some cases it may be necessary to specify minimal resources, and a user whose system does not meet these requirements receives either an incomplete display or no display at all. It is clear that the X window system was not designed to allow display replication, and as a result attempting to design extensions or additions to do so elegantly is not trivial. However allowing collaboration transparent applications is extremely desirable, as we cannot expect many useful applications to be rewritten in a collaboration aware manner. Multimedia applications are now starting to become available, initially with local area networks but increasingly with ISDN and other connection based networks in mind. Although conference systems designed for these networks will run over the next generation of networks such as Su-perJanet and other ATM networks, for the most part they do not take advantage of the increased flexibility, and potential for multicast that these networks can provide. However to make full use of such networks requires extensions of existing protocols. In particular, the current implementation of IP multicast does not elegantly support video switching, as it makes assumptions about the nature of multicast traffic which are not entirely justified for video traffic. Wide area multimedia conferencing is still in its infancy, and although their are standards such as H261 for video compression, they do not map well onto heterogeneous receivers on different bandwidth networks. Such standards clearly need to be developed. There are still many aspects We wish to thank Jon Crowcroft and Ian Wakeman for some of the ideas presented in this paper. We would also like to thank all our colleagues in the CAR project who are involved in the development of the conferencing system. This paper is dedicated to the ruins of Llanthony Abbey in the Black Mountains of South Wales.
