Abstract: Detecting spatial regularity in images arises in military applications, computer vision, scene analysis, and other areas. In this paper we give a O(n 5=2 )-time algorithm that for a given pointset finds all maximal approximately equally-spaced collinear subsets. Our algorithm is robust in that it can tolerate noise or imprecision that may be inherent in the measuring process. Thus, our algorithm is applicable in real-world arenas, such as landmine detection from infrared images.

Reference-contexts: Kahng and Robins [3] gave an optimal O (n 2 )-time algorithm for the exact version of the landmine detection problem, and their algorithm was later parallelized by Boxer and Miller <ref> [1] </ref>. However, we must often work with inexact data due to inaccuracies in mine placement, drift due to soil shifting, and imprecision inherent in the imaging technology.

Reference-contexts: A sequence of points that is both collinear and equally-spaced is said to be regular. Some techniques for addressing imprecision in geometric problems were introduced by Guibas et al. in <ref> [2] </ref>. While these methods are not readily applicable to our problem, we adopt some of their notation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Spatial regularity detection is an important problem in a number of domains such as computer vision, scene analysis, and landmine detection <ref> [3] </ref>. This paper focuses on the spatial regularity problem in the context of landmine detection from infrared terrain images, where for a given set of points, the goal is to recognize equally-spaced collinear subsets. <p> The detection of landmines from infrared images is made possible by two facts [5]: (1) landmines are usually deployed equally-spaced along straight rows, in order to enable their future recovery; and (2) landmines have a distinct signature in infrared images obtained from airborne or orbiting platforms. Kahng and Robins <ref> [3] </ref> gave an optimal O (n 2 )-time algorithm for the exact version of the landmine detection problem, and their algorithm was later parallelized by Boxer and Miller [1].

Reference-contexts: We use linear pogramming to process all of these constraints efficiently. A linear programming instance generally consists of a set of linear inequality constraints and an objective function that must be optimized subject to the constraints. In order to exploit efficient methods for solving low-dimensional linear programs <ref> [4] </ref>, we define the necessary constraints for our linear program to verify "-regularity by describing a regular sequence by a point and a vector in a manner similar to the point-slope description of a line, using the length of a vector ~v to describe the inter-point distance. <p> r 0 y are variables: p i x r 0 x + ~v x i " (5) p i y r 0 y + ~v y i " (7) Linear programs in fixed dimension (i.e. the number of variables) can be solved in time linear in the number of constraints <ref> [4] </ref>. In our application, the dimension is fixed at four (the four variables being r 0 x ; v x ; r 0 y ; v y ). Thus, the time required for the verification step is proportional to the length of the sequence.

Based on the above techniques, we can prove the following time complexity when interpoint-distances are are greater than 8". (see <ref> [7] </ref> for details): Theorem 4.1 The time complexity of algorithm RMD is O (n 5=2 ). 5 Conclusion We have formulated and addressed the Mine Detection Problem from inexact data. In the unconstrained variant, we have established an exponential lower bound on the output.
