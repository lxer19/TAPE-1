Abstract: We are engaged in studying the process of human birth by developing a computer-based dynamic model that can be adapted to specific birth scenarios. The individual characteristics of a given pregnant woman and fetus, embedded in their clinical measurements and CT and MRI images, are captured in the model. One can thereby predict adverse events that might happen during labor and delivery. Based on our findings from a preliminary design and execution of this model, we believe it holds great promise as an accurate, cost-effective diagnostic and teaching tool that will help predict conditions during individual labor scenarios that might cause traumatic birth injuries, and thereby enable us to make the most informed clinical decisions possible. 1 This paper is to appear in the proceedings of Medicine Meets Virtual Reality IV Conference,

Reference-contexts: The 3D surface models are constructed by fitting cubic nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces <ref> [4] </ref> through a set of bony outlines. Since then, by restricting our attention to the inner surface of the bony birth canal, which is the surface the fetus will interact with, a new representation of the topologically simple bony birth canal has been developed.

Reference-contexts: Bernhard Geiger did his Ph.D. thesis at INRIA Sophia Antipolis, France, on the subject of Three-dimensional modeling of human organs and its application to diagnosis and surgical planning <ref> [5] </ref>. His work was based on computational geometry (Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation [28]) and robotics compliant motion planning where a simulation of delivery is demonstrated. He used 23 axial MR images of a nonpregnant woman, each pair of images separated by a distance of 0.86cm. <p> successful vaginal delivery, a two-step simulation process will be adopted: * Step one: a geometric phase determining optimal paths/positions of the fetal head going through the birth canal, while estimating contacting forces using an approximate function based on volume intersection with the depth of inter penetration as an important indicator <ref> [5] </ref> * Step two: 9 10 11 a physical phase determining the precise forces on the fetus using the FEM at those positions where high pressure is expected based on the approximate calculation in the geometric phase.

Reference-contexts: While we wait for such a data set to become available, we have pursued a few other avenues: atlases, partial scans, and a plastic model. We have used a flat-bed scanner to acquire three series of sections of the fetal head and neck from <ref> [16] </ref>. Spontaneously or therapeutically aborted fetuses were frozen, sectioned and then each section was thawed and photographed. For our purposes the most useful is the third series, 12 axial sections through the head and neck of a 30 week old stillbirth.

Reference-contexts: Our aim is to capture the three P's on computers by providing a rational and comprehensive approach using a non-invasive computer-based tool in vitro to `manipulate' the fetus and foresee the forces applied. We have reported on constructing a customized CAD model of a pelvis from CT images <ref> [23] </ref> (the passage). Our continuing work on improving this model, building the fetus model (the passenger) and simulating interactions between the fetus and the birth canal is reported here. <p> by all means, such as by a selective assisted vaginal delivery, we shall go beyond the geometric/spatial aspects and put our emphasis on analyzing the forces acting on the fetus during the birth process. 3.1 Modeling the Birth Canal As a first step towards our final goal, we reported in <ref> [23] </ref> the development of a CAD surface model of the bones that surround the birth canal. The 3D surface models are constructed by fitting cubic nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces [4] through a set of bony outlines.

Reference-contexts: The final goal is to use this computer model to evaluate the forces (the power) involved in childbirth and their dispersal, especially to those structures frequently injured during difficult or premature labor. This evaluation cannot be replaced by retrospective correlation of the delivery process and the Apgar values <ref> [24] </ref> nor can it be `visualized' by standard imagery-based diagnostics [31]. <p> Though their method is resource intensive, they argue that their system returns quite accurate data in terms of forces acting on the fetal head, and that the method cannot be replaced by retrospective correlation of the delivery and the Apgar values. For example, Ludwig et al <ref> [24] </ref> reported on their finding of intracerebral bleedings on CT of 150 unselected full-term newborns 2 .

Reference-contexts: This is especially true for a normal-sized fetal head with a rather large-sized fetal abdomen, for example, the infant of a diabetic mother.

Reference-contexts: The adequateness value, however, indicates the quality of the passage. Only one pelvis-head pair was tested, although the head was scaled to different sizes. The encouraging feature of his simulation is that the simulated trajectory of the fetus corresponds to that described in the literature <ref> [29] </ref>. The work reported in [34] was a three-year project (92-94) carried out in Ger-many by a group of MDs and engineers on a method developed to perform dynamic, biomechanical postprocessing of the static information obtained from MRI. <p> It should be noted that the fetal skull easily fits through the modeled pelvis. This is due to the relatively small size of the plastic fetal model, which is 1-3 cm smaller than the average diameters of the fetal skull cited in <ref> [29] </ref>, and due to the absence of any soft tissues in the renderings. In Figure 6 the fetal head model is scaled to be too large to fit through the birth canal. Given data structures representing the fetus and the birth canal, we are able to detect and characterize intersections.

Reference-contexts: As 3.8 million births occur in the U.S. annually, the potential clinical importance and savings on the cost of health care that would result from developing an effective fetal-pelvic appraisal method are great. A simple assessment method for fetal-pelvic disproportion called the fetal-pelvic index <ref> [33] </ref> has achieved an overall accuracy in predicting required C/S on the order of 90 to 95%. This method has reconfirmed that the main problem during labor is not one of cephalopelvic disproportion, but of fetal-pelvic disproportion.
