Title: Combining Case-based Planning and Introspective Reasoning  
Author: Susan Fox David B. Leake 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Indiana University  
Abstract: There is much current interest in introspective reasoning, reasoning about reasoning processes themselves. One application of introspective reasoning is to detect flaws in a system's own reasoning, and to refine its reasoning methods to correct those flaws. We propose a framework for performing such introspective refinement, and describe its implementation in a system which combines introspective learning with case-based planning. We describe empirical tests performed to evaluate the effect of introspective reasoning for this system.

Reference-contexts: Because ROBBIE's world model is not guaranteed to be perfect, generation of a plan through case-based reasoning does not assure successful execution; after plans are generated ROBBIE executes them with a simulated robot using reactive planning <ref> (Firby, 1989) </ref>. Execution evaluates the quality of the CBR-created plan, and permits ROBBIE to arrive at a solution despite flaws in the plan. In addition, the reactive planner 2 handles facets of the simulated world that cannot be predicted by the CBR system, such as traffic lights and blocked streets.
