Abstract: A new method is presented for robustly estimating multiple view relations from point correspondences. There are three new contributions, the first is a new robust method, MLESAC, for estimating the relation. The second is a general purpose method of parametrizing these relations, automatically, using the output of the robust estimator to obtain the best parameterization. This parametrization facilitates a constrained optimisation to obtain the Maximum Likelihood Estimate of the relation. The third contribution is to use a common maximum likelihood (ML) formulation for all the multiple view relations. In order to derive the ML formulation point correspondences over j image are considered as a single 2j dimensional point by concatenating the image coordinates. It will be seen that these concatenated points must lie on a manifold determined by rigid motion and the minimization of the distance of correspondences from this manifold gives the maximum likelihood solution. Results are given for both synthetic and real images. It is demonstrated that the method gives results equal or superior to previous approaches. Keywords: Robust Estimation, Matching, Maximum Likelihood Estimation.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that rigid motion imposes constraints on the motion of points between the images. Between two views the matched points satisfy a number of relations including for example: the epipolar projectivities etc. These image relations are used for several purposes: (a) matching, (b) recovery of structure <ref> [1, 9, 12, 28, 39] </ref> (if this is possible), (c) motion segmentation [31, 34], (d) motion model selection [16, 29, 33].

Reference-contexts: The `Dominant Plane fundamental matrix' is actually a general fundamental matrix that can be recovered directly from six points: two in general position and four on a plane.

Reference-contexts: For brevity a correspondence may also be denoted by x 1;2 . 2 The Two View Relations Within this section the possible relations on the motion of points between two views are summarised, three examples are considered in detail: (a) the Fundamental matrix <ref> [4, 11] </ref>, (b) the planar projective transformation (projectivity), (c) the quadratic transformation. All these two view relations are estimable from image correspondences alone. The epipolar constraint is represented by the Fundamental matrix [4, 11]. <p> motion of points between two views are summarised, three examples are considered in detail: (a) the Fundamental matrix <ref> [4, 11] </ref>, (b) the planar projective transformation (projectivity), (c) the quadratic transformation.

Reference-contexts: It will be seen that any parameterization must enforce this constraint to accurately capture the two view geometry. The description of the algorithm for estimating the relations from corner correspondences over two images is given in Section 3. Due to the frequent occurrence of mismatches a RANSAC <ref> [5] </ref> like robust estimator is used to estimate the two view relation. RANSAC repeatedly generates solutions from minimal set of correspondences, and then tests the solution for support from the complete set of putative correspondences. In RANSAC the support is the number of correspondences with error below a given thresholded. <p> Potentially there are a significant number of mismatches amongst the initial matches. Correct matches will obey the epipolar geometry. The aim then is to obtain a set of inliers consistent with the epipolar geometry using a robust technique RANSAC has proved the most successful <ref> [5, 30, 38] </ref>. First we describe the application of RANSAC to the estimation of the fundamental matrix. Putative fundamental matrices (up to three solutions) are computed from a random set of seven corner correspondences (the minimum number required to compute a fundamental matrix). <p> These may then be combined to give the quadratic transformation by using Equation (9). For the RANSAC algorithm a decision needs to be made as to how many samples should be taken. As pointed out by Fischler and Bolles <ref> [5] </ref> this should be dependent on the expected number of outliers within the data, and they provide a suitable formula for deciding the number of samples. <p> After the non-linear stage the standard deviation of the ground truth error p drops to 0.22. Figure 5 shows that estimated error on synthetic data (conforming to random fundamental matrices) for three random sampling style robust estimators: RANSAC <ref> [5] </ref>, LMS [24] and MLESAC. It can be seen that for outlier percentages below 40% MLESAC outperforms the other two estimators, providing a 5 10% improvement.
