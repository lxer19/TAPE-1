Title: A Protocol for Scalable Loop-Free Multicast Routing  
Author: M. Parsa, and J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves 
Keyword: Index Terms-Loop-freedom, multicast routing.  
Abstract: In network multimedia applications, such as multiparty teleconferencing, users often need to send the same information to several (but not necessarily all) other users. To manage such one-to-many or many-to-many communication efficiently in wide-area internetworks, it is imperative to support and perform multicast routing. Multicast routing sends a single copy of a message from a source to multiple receivers over a communication link that is shared by the paths to the receivers. Loop-freedom is a specially important consideration in multicasting. Because applications using multi-casting tend to be multimedia and bandwidth intensive, and loops in multicast routing duplicate looping packets. We present and verify a new multicast routing protocol, called Multicast Internet Protocol (MIP), which offers a simple and flexible approach to constructing both group-shared and shortest-paths multicast trees. MIP can be sender-initiated or receiver-initiated or both; therefore, it can be tailored to the particular nature of an application's group dynamics and size. MIP is independent of the underlying unicast routing algorithms used. MIP is robust and adapts under dynamic network conditions (topology or link cost changes) to maintain loop-free multicast routing. Under stable network conditions, MIP has no maintenance or control message overhead. We prove that MIP is loop-free at every instant, and that it is deadlock-free and obtains multicast routing trees within a finite time after the occurrence of an arbitrary sequence of topology or unicast changes. This work was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under contracts F19628-93-C-0175 and F19628-96-C-0038. The preliminary description of this work was presented in part at the ICCCN'95 Conference, Las Vegas.

Reference-contexts: This complicates inter-domain multicasting if the domains involved use different unicast routing. The unicast routing also becomes more complicated by incorporating the multicast-related requirements. To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture <ref> [1] </ref> and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture [5]. Although both approaches constitute a substantial improvement over the current multicast architecture, each protocol has its own limitations [10].

Reference-contexts: However, in an internetwork, MIP would have to run on top of an unreliable datagram delivery service such as that provided by Internet Protocol (IP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [2] </ref>. Accordingly, MIP provides its own retransmission of queries and replies to ensure that they are exchanged reliably between neighbor routers.

Reference-contexts: The source does not need to know the addresses of the individual members of the group. Any sender can send to a group, whether or not it is a member of the group. The number and location of members in a group can be arbitrary and dynamic. IGMP <ref> [3] </ref> or a similar protocol is assumed for the routers to monitor the presence of group members on their attached subnetworks and to propagate and exchange multicast information.

Reference-contexts: Multicasting can benefit a wide array of network applications, including multiparty video or audio teleconferencing, collaborative environments, replicated databases, resource discovery, and parallel processing. Multicasting is supported in local area networks (LANs) using hardware technologies. Recently, multicasting has been extended to internetworks by Deering <ref> [4] </ref>. Based on Deering's work and built into the TCP/IP protocol suite, the internet group message protocol (IGMP) is used to disseminate multicast membership information to multicast routers. Deering's method permits routers to dynamically determine how to forward messages. A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. <p> Section 10 proves that MIP is loop-free at every instant and deadlock-free, and that it terminates within a finite time. 2 Overview of MIP 2.1 Multicast model Like CBT and PIM, MIP adopts the host group multicast model <ref> [4] </ref>, used in the existing IP architecture. The model defines the service interface to the users of an internetwork.

A major limitation of CBT is that it constructs only a single tree per group and thus provides longer end-to-end delays than would be obtained along a shortest-path tree.

Reference-contexts: PIM is based on the notion of soft state, which requires routers in a multicast tree to refresh their membership in the tree periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds, the suggested default value <ref> [6] </ref>). In contrast, MIP is based on diffusing computations [7, 8], which means that every computation started by a router to create and maintain a multicast tree is propagated to other routers as needed using a recursive query-response mechanism. <p> A shared tree is constructed with router 24 being the root and RP of MIP and PIM, respectively. For PIM, the timers are set to 60 seconds, which is the suggested default value for the Join/Prune refresh interval in PIM's specification <ref> [6] </ref>. For MIP, the receiver-initiated tree creation mode is used. The link delays are assumed to be the same in both directions. The network is lightly loaded, so that the link-delays and processing time is very small (compared to 60 seconds).

For a given group, MIP terminates when no router sends queries or replies for the group. Consider a stable topology and correct routing tables first. The expand, terminate and root-update computations terminate by the termination of a diffusing computation <ref> [7] </ref>, using the query and reply counters. The join computation terminates similarly: each reply decreases the number of receiver in the join-compute sets of routers in the network, and this number is bounded from below by zero.

Reference-contexts: A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. The tree in the existing IP architecture is the reverse shortest-path tree and shortest-path tree from the source to the group for distance-vector (i.e., DVMRP [11]) and link-state routing (i.e., MOSPF <ref> [9] </ref>), respectively. For example, the Multicast Backbone (MBone) in today's Internet consists of a set of routers running DVMRP. However, there are several shortcomings with the existing IP multicast architecture, i.e., DVMRP and MOSPF.

Both protocols have been shown to suffer from temporary loops resulting from the use of inconsistent unicast routing information <ref> [10] </ref>, and neither protocol has been verified to provide correct multicast routing trees after network changes. We present and verify a new multicast routing protocol called Multicast Internet Protocol 1 (MIP), which solves the shortcomings of the previous approaches to multicast routing.
