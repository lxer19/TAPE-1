Abstract: The heterogeneity of uncertainty in the real-world has driven the development of a wide variety of formal approaches to representing and reasoning with uncertainty in knowledge. There is now a shift to analysing the application of many of these formalisms. Here, we briefly consider some of the issues in the application of uncertainty formalisms.

Reference-contexts: Many factors affect the types of uncertainty [2, 8], sources of uncertainty <ref> [1, 5] </ref>, and the degrees of uncertainty. Nevertheless, there are many strategies that users adopt for aggregating such factors in order to minimize the negative ramifications of operating under uncertainty. Indeed, via learning, humans, and similarly organizations, can be become highly adept at using uncertain information.

Therefore we at least need to better grasp the notions within uncertainty formalisms before we have the conceptual apparatus to relate formalisms to applications, and it will be some time before it is possible to provide a definitive mapping between formalisms and applications.
