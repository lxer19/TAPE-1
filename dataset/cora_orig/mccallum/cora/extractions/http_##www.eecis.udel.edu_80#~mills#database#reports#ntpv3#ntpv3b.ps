Reference-contexts: Assuming the primary servers are synchronized to standard time within known accuracies, this provides a reliable, determistic specification on timekeeping accuracies throughout the synchronization subnet. Again drawing from the experience of the telephone industry, which learned such lessons at considerable cost <ref> [ABA89] </ref>, the synchronization subnet topology should be organized to produce the highest accuracy, but must never be allowed to form a loop. An additional factor is that each increment in stratum involves a potentially unreliable time server which introduces additional measurement errors.

Reference-contexts: Under normal circumstances it is intended that the synchronization subnet of primary and secondary servers assumes a hierarchical-master-slave configuration with the primary servers at the root and secondary servers of decreasing accuracy at successive levels toward the leaves. Following conventions established by the telephone industry <ref> [BEL86] </ref>, the accuracy of each server is defined by a number called the stratum , with the topmost level (primary servers) assigned as one and each level downwards (secondary servers) in the hierarchy assigned as one greater than the preceding level. <p> Subsequently, the dispersion will be updated by the clock-filter procedure. The above method amounts to a continuously sampled, returnable-time system, which is used in some digital telephone networks <ref> [BEL86] </ref>. Among the advantages are that the order and timing of the messages are unimportant and that reliable delivery is not required. Obviously, the accuracies achievable depend upon the statistical properties of the outbound and inbound data paths.

Reference-contexts: With respect to timekeeping accuracy and stability, the similarity of NTP to digital telephone systems is not accidental, since systems like this have been studied extensively [LIN80], <ref> [BRA80] </ref>. What makes the NTP model unique is the adaptive configuration, polling, filtering, selection and correctness mechanisms which tailor the dynamics of the system to fit the ubiquitous Internet environment. 2. <p> As the stratum increases from one, the singlesample accuracies achievable will degrade depending on the network paths and local-clock stabilities. In order to avoid the tedious calculations <ref> [BRA80] </ref> necessary to estimate errors in each specific configuration, it is useful to assume the mean measurement errors accumulate approximately in proportion to the measured delay and dispersion relative to the root of the synchronization subnet.

Reference-contexts: NTP was first described in RFC-958 [MIL85c], but has since evolved in significant ways, culminating in the most recent NTP Version 2 described in RFC-1119 [MIL89]. It is built on the Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [DAR81a] </ref> and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [POS80], which provide a connectionless transport mechanism; however, it is readily adaptable to other protocol suites.

Reference-contexts: It is built on the Internet Protocol (IP) [DAR81a] and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [POS80], which provide a connectionless transport mechanism; however, it is readily adaptable to other protocol suites. NTP is evolved from the Time Protocol [POS83b] and the ICMP Timestamp message <ref> [DAR81b] </ref>, but is specifically designed to maintain accuracy and robustness, even when used over typical Internet paths involving multiple gateways, highly dispersive delays and unreliable nets. The service environment consists of the implementation model and service model described in Section 2. <p> Related Technology Other mechanisms have been specified in the Internet protocol suite to record and transmit the time at which an event takes place, including the Daytime protocol [POS83a], Time protocol [POS83b], ICMP Timestamp message <ref> [DAR81b] </ref> and IP Timestamp option [SU81]. Experimental results on measured clock offsets and roundtrip delays in the Internet are discussed in [MIL83a], [MIL85b], [COL88] and [MIL88a].

Linear methods for digital telephone network synchronization are summarized in [LIN80], while agreement methods for clock synchronization are summarized in [LAM85]. <p> While it can be seen that the design of Hellospeak strongly influenced the design of NTP, Hellospeak itself is not an Internet protocol and is unsuited for use outside its local-net environment. The Unix 4.3bsd time daemon timed <ref> [GUS85a] </ref> uses a single master-time daemon to measure offsets of a number of slave hosts and send periodic corrections to them. In this model the master is determined using an election algorithm [GUS85b] designed to avoid situations where either no master is elected or more than one master is elected. <p> A logical clock is then constructed using these components plus software components that adjust the apparent time and frequency in response to periodic updates computed by NTP or some other timesynchronization protocol such as Hellospeak [MIL83b] or the Unix 4.3bsd TSP <ref> [GUS85a] </ref>. This section describes the Fuzzball local-clock model and implementation, which includes provi 36 sions for precise time and frequency adjustment and can maintain time to within 15 ns and frequency to within 0.3 ms per day.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the burdensome, but presumably infrequent, overheads of the election process, the offset measurement/correction process requires twice as many messages as NTP per update. A scheme with features similar to NTP is described in <ref> [KOP87] </ref>. This scheme is intended for multi-server LANs where each of a set of possibly many time servers determines its local-time offset relative to each of the other servers in the set using periodic timestamped messages, then determines the local-clock correction using the Fault-Tolerant Average (FTA) algorithm of [LUN84]. <p> The FTA algorithm, which is useful where up to k servers may be faulty, sorts the offsets, discards the k highest and k lowest ones and averages the rest. As described in <ref> [KOP87] </ref>, this scheme is most suitable to LAN environments which support broadcast and would result in unacceptable overhead in an internet environment.

Other synchronization algorithms are discussed in [LAM78], [GUS84], [HAL84], [LUN84], [LAM85], <ref> [MAR85] </ref>, [MIL85a], [MIL85b], [MIL85c], [GUS85b], [SCH86], [TRI86], [38], [39], [RIC88], [MIL88a], [DEC89] and [MIL90b], while protocols based on them are described in [MIL81a], [MIL81b], [MIL83b], [GUS85a], [MIL85c], [TRI86], [MIL88a], [DEC89] and [MIL90b].

Interactive-consistency algorithms are designed to detect faulty clock processes which might indicate grossly inconsistent offsets in successive readings or to different readers. <p> The clock filter and selection algorithms are designed so that the clock synchronization subnet self-organizes as a hierarchical-master-slave configuration [MIT80]. The selection algorithm is based on the intersection algorithm of Marzullo and Owicki <ref> [MAR85] </ref>, together with a refinement algorithm similar to the self-stabilizing algorithm of Lu [LU90]. With respect to timekeeping accuracy and stability, the similarity of NTP to digital telephone systems is not accidental, since systems like this have been studied extensively [LIN80], [BRA80]. <p> It constructs a list of candidate peers eligible to become the synchronization source, computes a confidence interval for each and casts out falsetick-ers using a technique adapted from Marzullo and Owicki <ref> [MAR85] </ref>. Next, it sorts the list of surviving candidates in order of stratum and synchronization distance and repeatedly casts out outlyers on the basis of select dispersion until only the most accurate, precise and stable survivors are left.

Reference-contexts: Provisions must be included to adjust the software logical-clock time and frequency in response to corrections produced by NTP. Section 5 describes a local-clock design evolved from the Fuzzball implementation described in <ref> [MIL83b] </ref> and [MIL88b]. This design includes offsetslewing, frequency compensation and deglitching mechanisms capable of accuracies in the order of a millisecond, even after extended periods when synchronization to primary reference sources has been lost. <p> Other synchronization algorithms are discussed in [LAM78], [GUS84], [HAL84], [LUN84], [LAM85], [MAR85], [MIL85a], [MIL85b], [MIL85c], [GUS85b], [SCH86], [TRI86], [38], [39], [RIC88], [MIL88a], [DEC89] and [MIL90b], while protocols based on them are described in [MIL81a], [MIL81b], <ref> [MIL83b] </ref>, [GUS85a], [MIL85c], [TRI86], [MIL88a], [DEC89] and [MIL90b]. NTP uses techniques evolved from them and both linear-systems and agreement methodologies. Linear methods for digital telephone network synchronization are summarized in [LIN80], while agreement methods for clock synchronization are summarized in [LAM85]. <p> These features are described in Section 4 and Appendix H of this document. The Fuzzball routing protocol <ref> [MIL83b] </ref>, sometimes called Hellospeak, incorporates time synchronization directly into the routing-protocol design. One or more processes synchronize to an external reference source, such as a radio clock or NTP daemon, and the routing algorithm constructs a minimum-weight spanning tree rooted on these processes. <p> A logical clock is then constructed using these components plus software components that adjust the apparent time and frequency in response to periodic updates computed by NTP or some other timesynchronization protocol such as Hellospeak <ref> [MIL83b] </ref> or the Unix 4.3bsd TSP [GUS85a]. This section describes the Fuzzball local-clock model and implementation, which includes provi 36 sions for precise time and frequency adjustment and can maintain time to within 15 ns and frequency to within 0.3 ms per day.

A companion document <ref> [MIL90b] </ref> summarizes the requirements, analytical models, algorithmic analysis and performance under typical Internet conditions. NTP was first described in RFC-958 [MIL85c], but has since evolved in significant ways, culminating in the most recent NTP Version 2 described in RFC-1119 [MIL89]. <p> In addition, as the result of experience in operating multiple-server subnets including radio clocks at several sites in the U.S. and with clients in the U.S. and Europe, reliable algorithms for selecting good clocks from a population possibly including broken ones have been developed [DEC89], [LU90], <ref> [MIL90b] </ref> and are described in Section 4. The accuracies achievable by NTP depend strongly on the precision of the local-clock hardware and stringent control of device and process latencies. Provisions must be included to adjust the software logical-clock time and frequency in response to corrections produced by NTP. <p> Experimental results on measured clock offsets and roundtrip delays in the Internet are discussed in [MIL83a], [MIL85b], [COL88] and [MIL88a].

NTP uses techniques evolved from them and both linear-systems and agreement methodologies. Linear methods for digital telephone network synchronization are summarized in [LIN80], while agreement methods for clock synchronization are summarized in [LAM85]. The Digital Time Service (DTS) [DEC89] has many of the same service objectives as NTP. <p> Obviously, the accuracies achievable depend upon the statistical properties of the outbound and inbound data paths. Further analysis and experimental results bearing on this issue can be found in <ref> [MIL90b] </ref> and in Appendix H. Test 4 requires that the calculated delay be within reasonable bounds: test4 ( | d | &lt; NTP.MAXDISPERSE and 0 &lt; e &lt; NTP.MAXDISPERSE ) ; /* test 4 */ Test 5 is implemented only if the authentication mechanism described in Appendix C is implemented. <p> While these algorithms are believed the best available at the present time, they are not an integral part of the NTP specification. A comprehensive discussion of the design principles and performance is given in Appendix H and <ref> [MIL90b] </ref>. 31 In order for the NTP filter and selection algorithms to operate effectively, it is useful to have a measure of recent sample variance recorded for each peer. The measure adopted in NTP is based on first-order differences, which are easy to compute and effective for the purposes intended.

Reference-contexts: Experimental results on measured clock offsets and roundtrip delays in the Internet are discussed in [MIL83a], [MIL85b], [COL88] and [MIL88a]. Other synchronization algorithms are discussed in [LAM78], [GUS84], [HAL84], [LUN84], [LAM85], [MAR85], [MIL85a], [MIL85b], [MIL85c], [GUS85b], <ref> [SCH86] </ref>, [TRI86], [38], [39], [RIC88], [MIL88a], [DEC89] and [MIL90b], while protocols based on them are described in [MIL81a], [MIL81b], [MIL83b], [GUS85a], [MIL85c], [TRI86], [MIL88a], [DEC89] and [MIL90b]. NTP uses techniques evolved from them and both linear-systems and agreement methodologies. <p> There are two classes of convergence functions, those involving interactive-convergence algorithms and those involving interactive-consistency algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose it is useful to distinguish between three categories of access: those that are preauthorized as trusted, preauthorized as friendly and all other (non-preauthorized) accesses. Presumably, preauthorization is accomplished by entries in the configuration file or some kind of ticket-management system such as Kerberos <ref> [STE88] </ref>. In this model only trusted accesses can result in the peer becoming the synchronization source. While friendly accesses cannot result in the peer becoming the synchronization source, NTP messages and timestamps are returned as specified.

Reference-contexts: Related Technology Other mechanisms have been specified in the Internet protocol suite to record and transmit the time at which an event takes place, including the Daytime protocol [POS83a], Time protocol [POS83b], ICMP Timestamp message [DAR81b] and IP Timestamp option <ref> [SU81] </ref>. Experimental results on measured clock offsets and roundtrip delays in the Internet are discussed in [MIL83a], [MIL85b], [COL88] and [MIL88a].

Reference-contexts: These algorithms use an agreement protocol involving successive rounds of readings, possibly relayed and possibly augmented by digital signatures. Examples include the fireworks algorithm of [HAL84] and the optimum algorithm of <ref> [SRI87] </ref>. However, these algorithms require large numbers of messages, especially when large numbers of clocks are involved, and are designed to detect faults that have rarely been found in the Internet experience.

NTP uses techniques evolved from them and both linear-systems and agreement methodologies. Linear methods for digital telephone network synchronization are summarized in [LIN80], while agreement methods for clock synchronization are summarized in [LAM85]. <p> The election process requires a broadcast capability, which is not a ubiquitous feature of the Internet. While this model has been extended to support hierarchical configurations in which a slave on one network serves as a master on the other <ref> [TRI86] </ref>, the model requires handcrafted configuration tables in order to establish the hierarchy and avoid loops. In addition to the burdensome, but presumably infrequent, overheads of the election process, the offset measurement/correction process requires twice as many messages as NTP per update.
