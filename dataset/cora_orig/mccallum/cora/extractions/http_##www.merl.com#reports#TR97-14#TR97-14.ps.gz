Abstract: Image rendering maps scene parameters to output pixel values; animation maps motion-control parameters to trajectory values. Because these mapping functions are usually multidimensional, nonlinear, and discontinuous, finding input parameters that yield desirable output values is often a painful process of manual tweaking. Interactive evolution and inverse design are two general methodologies for computer-assisted parameter setting in which the computer plays a prominent role. In this paper we present another such methodology. Design Gallery TM (DG) interfaces present the user with the broadest selection, automatically generated and organized, of perceptually different graphics or animations that can be produced by varying a given input-parameter vector. The principal technical challenges posed by the DG approach are dispersion, finding a set of input-parameter vectors that optimally disperses the resulting output-value vectors, and arrangement, organizing the resulting graphics for easy and intuitive browsing by the user. We describe the use of DG interfaces for several parameter-setting problems: light selection and placement for image rendering, both standard and image-based; opacity and color transfer-function specification for volume rendering; and motion control for particle-system and articulated-figure animation. Keywords: Animation, computer-aided design, image rendering, lighting, motion synthesis, particle systems, physical modeling, visualization, volume ren dering.

Reference-contexts: Selecting a thumbnail brings up a full-size image, which can then be moved to the surrounding image gallery. Mousing on an image in the gallery highlights its associated thumbnail, and vice versa. Thumbnail layout is accomplished using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) <ref> [3] </ref> method due to Torgerson [24]. 4 Given a matrix of distances between points, MDS procedures compute an embedding of the points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space (2D in our case) such that the interpoint distances in the embedding closely match those in the given matrix.

Reference-contexts: An optimal w-way partition of this graph would comprise w disjoint vertex subsets of equal cardinality such that the cost of the cut set, the total cost of all edges that connect vertices in different subsets, is minimized.

Reference-contexts: When the interpoint distances come from an embedding of the points in a high-dimensional Euclidean space (which is true for the applications we discuss here, although it need not be true in general), classical scaling is equivalent to an efficient technique for computing a principal-component analysis of the points <ref> [5, 13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A more intrinsic difficulty is that of requiring the user to quantify a priori the desired illuminative characteristics of the resulting image.

The most difficult lighting parameters to set are those relating to light type and placement, so they have been the focus of our efforts. 2.1 Input and Output Vectors For the light selection and placement problem, we begin with a scene model comprising surfaces and viewing parameters. <p> Images can be dragged to the palette, where light intensity and temperature can be varied interactively. Multiple images are composited to form a full-size image in the lower left. 2.4 Results The DG in Figure 9 contains a scene inspired by an example from <ref> [8] </ref>. The floor, ceiling, and all four walls (only the rear one is visible) were designated light-hook surfaces. The surfaces comprising the figures were designated light-target surfaces, as was the back wall. The 584 lights in the gallery were selected from 5,000 randomly generated lights in the dispersion phase.
