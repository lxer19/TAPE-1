Using relational database products by the Oracle Corporation (see also <ref> [3] </ref>), a Neuro-Oncology Information System that is now functioning over the Internet (see [4]) has been built [5].

Reference-contexts: Using relational database products by the Oracle Corporation (see also [3]), a Neuro-Oncology Information System that is now functioning over the Internet (see [4]) has been built <ref> [5] </ref>. The information system functions with IBM and Macintosh platforms, and all investigators on the BTPP and GMN projects have access to it through computers in their offices and laboratories. The NOIS employs security features aimed at assuring patient anonymity. <p> Figure 16 represents this fact. The process of identification of weak entities will typically increase substantially the number of entities in the model. Although a detailed description of all entities and attributes currently used in the model fall outside the scope of this document, <ref> [5] </ref> contains an exhaustive set of diagrams representing the entire model. 19 3.6 The Relational Model In this section we present a brief and informal discussion about the process of migration from the abstract ER model to the relational database model, suitable for computer implementation. <p> To this effect we use data diagrams, which resemble ER diagrams, but that actually represent a relational model. Rectangles in those diagrams represent tables, and lines between rectangles ("relationships") indicate the existence of a foreign key relating the two tables. <ref> [5] </ref> contains samples of such diagrams. 4 User Interface Our approach to user interface design derives from cognitive engineering, in which human users of tools in general (and computer systems in particular) are modeled as cognitive information processors.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the database itself may best be implemented as a centralized system, but it is not feasible for access to be centralized. A system model which supports this arrangement well is the so-called client-server model <ref> [6] </ref>. In this model, a server provides a "service", to clients that use the service provided.

Reference-contexts: This modeling involves a certain amount of abstraction, so it is convenient that we perform it in a manner that is somewhat removed from its eventual implementation and that allows for such abstraction (see, for example, <ref> [7] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Finally, because the order in which treatments are provided, the elapsed timed between treatments and other chronological facts are of extreme relevance for the research, it is necessary to represent every element of a treatment modality as a dated event <ref> [10] </ref>. In and their inter-relationships. 3.2 The Entity-Relationship Model The ER model is extensively used, and it allows the representation of data models in a graphical manner. Recognizable outstanding data objects, such as patients and physicians, are called Entities. They are graphically represented as boxes.

Reference-contexts: There is not a single standard to attach meaning to the different symbols used in the ER model to represent entities and relationships, so we need to establish our conventions. They are taken from <ref> [11] </ref>, and they follow: * Entities are represented by rectangles with rounded corners. * Relationships are lines connecting entities. * Each side of every such line is broken or solid according to whether the relationship is optional or mandatory for the entity on that side of the relationship. * The cardinality <p> If a relationship is part of a unique identifier, then the corresponding foreign key will be part of the primary key. The generation process is laborious. Fortunately, it can be achieved automatically through the use of tools such as the one described in <ref> [11] </ref>. It is useful to describe the result of this process in a graphical manner. To this effect we use data diagrams, which resemble ER diagrams, but that actually represent a relational model.

Reference-contexts: This kind of data is generic for all people, so the distinction between patients and physicians as entities of a different nature is not relevant in this context. We need to resort to the concept of generalization, <ref> [12] </ref>: we make an abstraction of the two entities and represent this abstraction as a new entity, which we will call PERSON. Instead of introducing new notation to represent this generalization method, we will do it using one-to-one relationships between PATIENT and PERSON and between PHYSICIAN and PERSON.

Reference-contexts: However, certain guidelines need to be followed to ensure certain minimal quality requirements, such as consistency of data and redundancy avoidance. These requirements are met when the data model is in Third Normal Form, a term taken from the Theory of Normalization developed by Codd <ref> [13] </ref>. We recognize this normal form under two conditions: * The primary key of every table is minimal, i.e., no proper subset of any primary key is itself a primary key. * No table contains transitive dependencies.

Reference-contexts: The process of forcing a set of tables to meet the above conditions is known as normalization. A rigorous explanation of this process falls outside 20 of the scope of this document, but it can be found in textbooks such as <ref> [14] </ref>. However, when we generate tables from our ER model, we need to create them in the Third Normal Form. The process of translation from an ER model to a Relational model is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: It and similar models have led to the now conventional practice of task-centered user interface design within the human-computer interaction (HCI) community <ref> [16] </ref>. 21 4.1 User Interface Design Norman's model observes that people form broad goals that are then resolved into detailed tasks that must be matched to those a tool can perform directly.

Reference-contexts: Browsers typically provide a graphical user interface: a user may view the data and its various relationships, may formulate queries on the data, and then may execute the queries to retrieve the desired data values. Oracle provides a tool called the Data Browser <ref> [18] </ref> for general data query and viewing. This tool allows the user (or more likely, the technical support staff) to form views of the database that are projections of various sets of fields from any set of tables in the NOIS database.

Reference-contexts: We have decided to build an on-line help system for Neuro-Oncology Information System (NOIS) clients and other interested parties using the facilities of the World-Wide Web, WWW, also called just the Web (see also <ref> [19] </ref>). This decision was motivated by several considerations: * The Web provides a distributed hypertext document system, conceptually similar to many online help systems. Among others, the Microsoft Windows help system is a hypertext help system, and the popular MAC HyperCard application is a hypertext development tool.
