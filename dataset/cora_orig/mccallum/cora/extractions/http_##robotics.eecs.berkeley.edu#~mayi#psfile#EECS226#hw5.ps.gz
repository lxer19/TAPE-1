Abstract: 1. Let X be a scalar rv. There are two hypotheses 0 and 1, and p XjH (xj0) = x 2 for x 2 [0; 2], while p XjH (xj1) = 3x 2 for x 2 [0; 1]. a) What is the form of the likelihood ratio test? b) Find a decision rule that minimizes P (decide0jH = 1) subject to the constraint that P (decide1jH = 0) = 0:05. c) Plot the error curve. d) Suppose now we are given a prior on H with P (H = 0) = 2 span a subspace of dimension k. What is a sufficient statistic of the smallest dimension you can find for the hypothesis testing problem? Give a geometric interpretation. 4.a) A coin has unknown probability p with head faced up. Find the maximum likelihood estimate of p after n independent flips of the coin. b) Suppose now that p is modeled as a rv X and we have a prior that X is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Find the mean-square error of the ML estimate founded in part (a). Is this the MMSE estimate of X?
