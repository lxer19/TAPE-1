Abstract: In previous applications, bilateral symmetry of objects was used either as a descriptive feature in domains such as recognition and grasping, or as a way to reduce the complexity of structure from motion. In this paper we propose a novel application, using the symmetry property to "symmetrize" data before and after reconstruction. We first show how to compute the closest symmetric 2D and 3D configurations given noisy data. This gives us a symmetrization procedure, which we apply to images before reconstruction, and which we apply to the 3D configuration after reconstruction. We demonstrate a significant improvement obtained with real images. We demonstrate the relative merits of symmetrization before and after reconstruction using simulated and real data. This report describes research done at the Hebrew Univresity of Jerusalem within the Institute of Computer Science.

Reference-contexts: Find the optimal rotation and translation which minimizes the sum of squared distances between the original points and the reflected corresponding points (Fig. 1c). This is a well known problem of pose estimation. To find the solution we use the method of Arun et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>, which requires no more than the evaluation of SVD. 4. Rotate the reflected points f ~ P i g n1 i=0 by the optimal rotation. 5. Average each original point P i with its reflected matched point ~ P j , obtaining the point ^ P i (Fig. 1d). <p> Two randomly chosen 3D mirror-symmetric connected configuration of 10 points are shown in Figure 4a. Points were selected randomly in the box <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 . Eight noisy 2D projections were created for each of the 3D configurations. Perspective projection was used with a focal length of 5. <p> Finally, following the reconstruction. The differences and percentage of improvement are summarized in Table 1. In order to obtain some statistical appraisal of the improvement obtained by correcting for symmetry, we applied the simulation many times while varying the simulation parameters. Points were, again, selected randomly in the box <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 . The number of points was varied between 8 and 24, the number of views was varied between 8 and 24, and the noise level was taken as = 0:001; 0:005; 0:01; 0:05 and 0:1. Every combination of parameters was simulated 300 times.

Reference-contexts: We are given several noisy 2D projections of such an object, where the projection is approximately weak perspective (scaled orthographic). In this work we combine the invariant reconstruction algorithm described in <ref> [16] </ref> with a symmetrization method, to improve the input and output data in the structure reconstruction from several views. <p> We use the two approaches of correction for symmetry which were described in Section 1.

It computes an invariant description of the Euclidean structure of points from a sequence of images assuming weak perspective.

Reference-contexts: Many studies deal with inferring 3D symmetry from 2D data. These studies deal with perfect non-noisy data. In this paper, we deal with noisy 2D data by extending the notion of Symmetry Distance defined in <ref> [17] </ref> to 2D projections of 3D objects which are not necessarily perfectly symmetric. We describe in this work the reconstruction of 3D mirror symmetric connected configurations from their noisy 2D projections. <p> Most studies deal with a specific symmetry class such as circular (radial) symmetry [2, 11] or mirror and linear symmetry [8, 5]. A method for dealing with any type of symmetry in both 2D and 3D has recently been suggested <ref> [19, 18, 17] </ref>.

An iterative folding/unfolding method, which finds the closest symmetric configuration, was described in <ref> [18, 17] </ref>. Below we describe another closed-form solution that gives equivalent results in the case of 3D mirror-symmetry. <p> Minimize the symmetry distance value obtained in step 6 by repeating steps 1-6 with all possible division of points into sets. The mirror symmetric configuration corresponding to the minimal symmetry value is the closest mirror symmetric configuration in a least squares sense (proof is given in <ref> [17] </ref>). In practice, the minimization in step 7 is greatly simplified when the configuration of points is connected (or partially connected). Consider the original configuration as a graph G = fV; Eg where V is the set of vertices (points) and E is the set of edges.
