Title: PREENS Tutorial How to use tools and NN simulations  
Author: Louis Vuurpijl 
Note: Contents  
Date: December 23, 1994  
Abstract: This report contains a description about how to use PREENS: its tools, convis and its neural network simulation programs. It does so by using several sample sessions. For more technical details, I refer to the convis technical description.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned before, you must start convis with the -m option if you want to run the kohonen neural network. This is because the Kohonen neural network implements a number of miscel 6 laneous actions. The algorithms are based on publications by Kohonen <ref> [1] </ref>. See the subject on learning for more details.

Reference-contexts: For each of the networks, the actions save patterns and save network do not have to be explained. 4.1 Backpropagation. Backpropagation is a popular name for multi-layered perceptrons, generally acknowledged to be developed by Rumelhart et al <ref> [2] </ref>. A wide range of enhancements and changes to the original algorithm have been used and proposed, of which three are implemented by us.
