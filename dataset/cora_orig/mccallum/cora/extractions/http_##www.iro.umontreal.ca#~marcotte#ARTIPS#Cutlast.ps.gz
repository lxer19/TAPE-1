Reference-contexts: Our convergence proof does not rely on volume reduction arguments used for the ellipsoid and related methods (see Luthi <ref> [9] </ref> and Magnanti and Perakis [10]). The algorithm generates sequences of points that are feasible with respect to the primal constraints; these sequences contain at least one subsequence that converges to an equilibrium solution. Complexity results are given, under the additional assumption that the variational inequality is pseudo co-coercive.
