Abstract: This paper presents a number of types of constraints representing application semantics as a way of reducing the complexity of networks of semantic connections in hypermedia. Unlike constraints developed in the past, those presented in this work are graph-based and can be evaluated within local regions of the hypermedia system. In addition, this work presents an algebra on overview graphs of hypermedia systems. To formalize the definitions of the algebra and constraints, this paper presents a data model for hypermedia. Also, this paper presents an algebra on networks of semantic connections in hypermedia. This algebra, in itself, can be used to define overview graphs on networks of semantic connections. In addition, the algebra increases the expressive power of the constraints by allowing the definition of overview graphs to which the constraints can be applied.
