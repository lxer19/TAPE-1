Abstract: Bayesian inference for exponential mixtures is presented in the paper, including the choice of a non-informative prior based on a location-scale reparameterization of the mixture. Adapted control sheets are proposed for studying the convergence of the associated Gibbs sampler. They exhibit a strong lack of stability in the allocations of the observations to the different components of the mixture. The setup is extended to the case when the number of components in the mixture is unknown and a reversible jump MCMC technique is implemented. The results are illustrated on simulations and a real dataset.

(As shown in Figure 3.5, the control variate estimates ffi 1 ` usually start below the value 1.) Additional estimates of IE [h (x)] can be constructed as for usual control variate methods <ref> (see Robert, 1996a) </ref>. As shown in Figure 3.5, the various parameters lead to different convergence times in the sense that that the control variate estimates ffi 1 ` achieve a 1% or :5% error rate for different numbers of iterations, but they all converge to 1.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the other convergence indicators exhibit a strong stability. Therefore, the use of a noninformative prior, instead of a vague prior with selected hyperparameters as in Richardson and Green (1997), does not seem to induce a different behavior, contrary to the normal mixture case <ref> (see Robert, 1997) </ref>, a feature which can be attributed to the weak identifiability of exponential mixtures. <p> the two first components.) The behavior of the allocation graph thus stresses the weak identifiability structure of the mixtures of exponential distributions, in the sense that most observations can be indifferently allocated to one component or another, as opposed to normal mixtures where the allocation maps exhibit much more stability <ref> (see Robert, 1997, for an illustration) </ref>. This feature is also exposed in the control device of Figure 3.1 [lower left], namely the graph of the average allocations versus the expected allocation evaluated on the estimated parameters. <p> But it could signify that the sequences of z (t) j 's are actually stationary, with a very flat distribution which would also explain for the quick mixing behavior observed on Figure 3.2. In the normal case <ref> (see, e.g., Robert, Ryden and Titterington, 1997) </ref>, the control based on the CLT requires a much larger number of iterations. 3.3 Riemann control variates. Another direction for convergence control follows from the developments of Philippe (1997b) on Riemann sums for numerical integration. <p> In this setup, the exponential mixtures are again quite distinct from the normal mixture, where inference conditional on k seems much more delicate <ref> (see Fig. 11 in Robert, 1997) </ref>. This difference may be attributed to higher mixing properties of the resulting MCMC algorithm or to different properties of the selected prior.
