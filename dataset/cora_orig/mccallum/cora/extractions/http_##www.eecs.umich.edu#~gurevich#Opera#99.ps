Abstract: We introduce curbing, a new nonmonotonic technique of commonsense reasoning that is based on model minimality but unlike circumscription treats disjunction inclusively. A first-order theory T is transformed to a formula Curb(T ) whose set of models is defined as the smallest collection of models which contains all minimal models of T and which is closed under formation of minimal upper bounds with respect to inclusion. We first give a rather intuitive definition of Curb in third-order logic and then show how Curb can be equivalently expressed in second-order logic. We study the complexity of inferencing from a curbed theory in the propositional case and present a PSPACE algorithm for this problem. Finally, we address different possibilities to approximate the curb of a theory.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, deciding if Curb ffi (F (P; Z); P; Z) 6j= G is in NP NP = P 2 , which implies that "Inference" is in P 2 -hardness for ffi = 0 (i.e. circumscription) was shown in <ref> [2] </ref>. The construction used in the proof can be easily generalized to arbitrary finite constant ffi. 2 Bounded Disjunctions Another attempt is to limit the cardinality of model sets from which minimal upper bounds are formed.

Reference-contexts: An extension of this example is even more impressive. Imagine a handful of coins thrown onto a chessboard; circumscription tells us that no coin touches both a black and a white field. It is not clear whether any of the well-known variants of circumscription (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>) can handle inclusive disjunction of positive information in a suitable way. In this paper we suggest an approach to tackle the problem pointed out by Reiter. We present the new curb method, which is a generalization of circumscription able to handle inclusive disjunctions of positive information properly.

Reference-contexts: ('(p); p) is true. 2 Remark: Curb fl ('(p); p) involves a second-order constant G 2 ; it can be eliminated by a more involved construction, at least over all infinite structures. 10 4 Computational Complexity An important aspect of any reasoning method is, of course, its computational complexity (cf. <ref> [4] </ref> for basic concepts and definitions). It is clear that our method is in the full first-order case highly undecidable, just as any of the well-known methods in nonmonotonic reasoning. We give here a more detailed account of the propositional case.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Circumscription <ref> [6, 7, 5] </ref> is one of the most promising principles for formalizing commonsense reasoning. However, as recently pointed out by Raymond Reiter, it runs into problems in connection with disjunctive information. <p> We write M M p etc. if z is empty; M p and p are partial orders on M M p resp. all structures. The circumscription of p in a first-order sentence '(p; z) with z floating is the second-order sentence <ref> [5] </ref> '(p; z) & :9p 0 ; z 0 ('(p 0 ; z 0 ) & (p 0 p)) which will be denoted by Circ ('(p; z)) (p and z will be always presupposed). <p> Lifschitz noted the following. Proposition 3.1 <ref> [5] </ref> M j= Circ ('(p; z)) iff M is p;z -minimal among the models of '(p; z). 3.1 formal definition and logical description We formally define the concept of a "good" model as follows.

Reference-contexts: We assume ZFC, i.e. Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice, as a standard metamathematical frame [10]. As for circumscription, we need a language of higher-order logic (cf. <ref> [11] </ref>) over a set of predicate and function symbols, i.e. variables and constants of finite arity n 0 of suitable type. 0-ary function symbols are identified with symbols for individuals and have order 0; 0-ary predicate symbols are identified with propositional symbols and have order 1. <p> A sentence is a formula in which no variable occurs free; it is of order n + 1 if the order of any quantified symbol occurring in it is n <ref> [11] </ref>. A structure M consists of a nonempty set jM j and an assignment I (M ) of predicates, i.e. relations (resp. functions), of suitable type over jM j to the predicate (resp. function) constants.
