Reference-contexts: Utilizing Theorem 3 and Lemma 1, we can conclude: Proposition 8 (Complexity of F SL) Subsumption in F SL without 1 can be decided in exponential time <ref> [ Ben-Ari et al., 1982 ] </ref> , and deciding subsumption in F SL can be done in double exponential time [ Vardi, 1985 ] . Furthermore, both problems are EXPTIME-hard [ Parikh, 1979, x7 ] . <p> Furthermore, both problems are EXPTIME-hard [ Parikh, 1979, x7 ] . We now present a sound and complete algorithm for deciding coherence of 1 -free F SL-concepts in deterministic exponential time as described in <ref> [ Ben-Ari et al., 1982 ] </ref> . <p> In contrast to this result, the finite model property holds for 1 -free F SL. Proposition 11 (Finite Models for 1 -free F SL) Every coherent 1 -free F SL-concept C has a connected model over D with jDj 4 n n 2 , where n = l (C) <ref> [ Ben-Ari et al., 1982 ] </ref> . 11 4.2 Concept Equations and Inequations The terminological logics investigated seem to be very expressive. Nevertheless, they do not support concept definitions and constraints.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, T SL could easily be shown to be a notational variant of converse-PDL as given in <ref> [ Fischer and Ladner, 1979 ] </ref> . <p> Using Theorem 2, we can infer: Proposition 3 (Lower Compl. Bound of T SL) Deciding subsumption in ALC extended with the transitive-reflexive closure of roles is EXPTIME-hard, even if involving only a single atomic role <ref> [ Fischer and Ladner, 1979 ] </ref> . Concerning the upper complexity bound, Pratt [ 1979 ] gave an algorithm for deciding PDL-satisfiability requiring at most exponential time. As Harel [ 1984, Section 2.5.6 ] pointed out, the algorithm can easily be extended to deal with 1 . <p> Proposition 6 (Finite T SL-Models) Every coherent T SL-concept C has a connected model over D with jDj 2 l (C) <ref> [ Fischer and Ladner, 1979 ] </ref> . In contrast to that, the finite model property does not hold for T SL augmented with the intersection of roles, called T SLR.

Reference-contexts: EXPTIME for which it is only known that P 6= EXPTIME. 1 Confer [ Nebel, 1990 ] for a good overview of the systems and the complexity results. 2 For the history of modal logic confer [ Hughes and Cresswell, 1984 ] , and for that of dynamic logic confer <ref> [ Harel, 1984 ] </ref> . 1 3 Terminological Logics and Modal Logics We first consider a terminological logic investigated by Schmidt-Schau and Smolka [ 1991 ] , named ALC. Like any other terminological logic, ALC comprises concepts, denoting sets, as well as roles, which denote binary relations. <p> Theorem 2 T SL is a notational variant of converse-PDL, the propositional dynamic logic PDL with the converse-operator. Moreover, satisfiability in converse-PDL has the same computational complexity as coherence in T SL. For an excellent introduction to dynamic logic you may confer <ref> [ Harel, 1984 ] </ref> . There, one can find a survey of interesting theorems of dynamic logic which can now be expounded as theorems of T SL. Hence, for instance, we can narrow down the computational complexity of T SL. <p> Using Theorem 2, we know that T SL-coherence is contained in EXPTIME, and therefore T SL-subsumption is in co-EXPTIME. However, co-EXPTIME is the same as EXPTIME. So we have: Proposition 4 (Upper Compl. Bound of T SL) Subsumption in T SL can be decided in exponential time <ref> [ Pratt, 1979, Harel, 1984, Section 2.2/2.5.6 ] </ref> . As another by-product of the correspondence we gain an axiomatization of T SL which assumes 1 to be applied only to atomic roles. <p> The axioms for ALC together with 8R t S:C = (8R:C) u (8S:C) 8id (C):D = :C t D C u 8R fl :(:C t 8R:C) v 8R fl :C C v 8r 1 :9r:C are a sound and complete axiomatization of T SL-equivalence <ref> [ Pratt, 1979, Harel, 1984, Section 2.5.6 ] </ref> . By the way, the first three axioms indicate that T SL without fl and 1 is reduced to ALC since t, ffi, id can be eliminated linearly. The correspondence theorem additionally provides us with an elaborated model theory. <p> The reason is that every model E for 8r fl :((9r:&gt;) u 8 (r + u self)::&gt;) has an infinite acyclic E [r]-chain. Proposition 7 (Infinite T SLR-Models) There is a coherent T SLR-concept which has no finite model <ref> [ Harel, 1984, Theorem 2.35 ] </ref> . Note that this does not mean that T SLR is undecidable. Actually, the decidability of T SLR seems to be unknown. <p> Note that this does not mean that T SLR is undecidable. Actually, the decidability of T SLR seems to be unknown. It is known, however, that T SL extended with the complementation of roles is undecidable <ref> [ Harel, 1984, Theorem 2.34 ] </ref> , and that T SLR with features is highly undecidable as we shall see in the next section. 4.1 T SL with Features In T SL we are able to force, for instance, that something has at least two parents, namely a female and a <p> Surprisingly, allowing the intersection of roles does not preserve the de-cidability of F SL. Proposition 9 (Undecidability of F SLR) Subsumption in F SL augmented with role intersection is highly undecidable, even if involving only features as atomic roles <ref> [ Harel, 1984, Theorem 2.36 ] </ref> . With Theorem 3 we gain new model theoretic insights into F SL. For the ability to force an F SL-model to be infinite, both features and 1 are essential. <p> The first signifies that only connected models are relevant for global consequence in T SL. This can easily be proved by utilizing the so-called collapsed model property of T SL stating that every T SL-model can be collapsed into a finite connected one <ref> [ Harel, 1984, Theorem 2.13 ] </ref> . Lemma 2 Let [ fEg be a set of T SL-concept equations and inequations. Then j= E iff each connected extension function E satisfying all elements of , also satisfies E. <p> Clearly, c v 8r + :d is a global consequence of but not a global consequence of any finite subset of . In fact, global consequence in T SL is known to be highly undecidable <ref> [ Harel, 1984, Section 2.4 ] </ref> .

We immediately know, for example, that without loss of generality, it suffices to consider either finite ALC-models of exponential size or a single infinite canonical ALC-model (cf. e.g. <ref> [ Hughes and Cresswell, 1984 ] </ref> ). We shall expose two other outcomes of the correspondence, namely an axiomatization of ALC and the complexity of ALC somewhat closer.

To overcome this deficiency, we shall introduce an extension of ALC, named T SL.

Now we shall prove that deciding subsumption in ALC is PSPACE-complete. Of course, this is not a new result, but its proof is much simpler than the original six-page one in [ Schmidt-Schau and Smolka, 1991 ] .

Clearly, features correspond to atomic deterministic programs considered in dynamic logic. Thus <ref> [ Parikh, 1979, x7 ] </ref> can be read to show that any atomic role r is expressible by f r ffi (f new ) fl , where f r is the feature uniquely corresponding to r and f new is a new feature. <p> Furthermore, both problems are EXPTIME-hard <ref> [ Parikh, 1979, x7 ] </ref> .
