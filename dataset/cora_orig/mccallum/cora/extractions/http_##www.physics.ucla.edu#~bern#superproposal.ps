Abstract: A number of projects being pursued by the theoretical and experimental high energy physics groups at UCLA require high speed computers. The advent of inexpensive machines rated at 1 Gigaflop each provides a cost effective solution. This proposal outlines the need for a cluster of such computers by the high energy physics groups at UCLA. This proposal has been approved and we are currently purchasing computers. The cluster will consist of a combination of Linux Alphas and Pentiums.

Reference-contexts: With this configurations this machine will be the fastest on campus, including the SP2 supercomputer. 2 Theoretical Jet Calculations Prof. Bern of the Theoretical Physics Group will be pursuing new next-to-leading order (NLO) jet calculations made possible by the recent computation of the required one-loop matrix elements <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. In order to have sufficiently precise theoretical predictions for jet physics, one must compute at least to next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling. Together with Lance Dixon and David Kosower, Prof. <p> Bern has developed a set of techniques which allow for the computation of one-loop matrix elements that have not been previously obtained. (These techniques have recently been reviewed in ref. [3].) In particular, they have computed one-loop matrix elements necessary for NLO corrections to three-jet production at hadron colliders <ref> [1] </ref>. They have also very recently completed a computation of all one-loop corrections to the process Z ! 4 partons [2] and for processes related to this.

Reference-contexts: In order to convert these matrix elements into jets rates that can be compared to experiments, it is necessary to appropriately combine the real and virtual contributions to cancel the infrared divergences and to construct Monte Carlo computer programs to evaluate the phase space integrals <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Such programs should lead to an improved understanding of jet structure. At the Tevatron, this may also lead to an independent measurement of the parton distribution functions. <p> The new three-jet program for hadron colliders, currently under development, is anticipated to be approximately two orders of magnitude more computationally intensive than the previous generation of NLO programs, which are based on the matrix elements of Ellis and Sexton [7]. (For comparison, the previous generation of NLO jet programs <ref> [4, 5] </ref> require significant amounts of CPU time.

Reference-contexts: In collaboration with Dr. P. Gondolo (Max Planck Institute in Munich) and G. Varieschi (a graduate student at UCLA) Prof. Gelmini is in the process of updating and improving previous determinations of the atmospheric muon and neutrino fluxes at energies above 1 TeV in the framework of perturbative QCD <ref> [8] </ref>. At the energies of interest, these atmospheric fluxes pass from being originated in decays of pions and kaons to being predominantly generated in semileptonic decays of charmed particles.

Reference-contexts: At the energies of interest, these atmospheric fluxes pass from being originated in decays of pions and kaons to being predominantly generated in semileptonic decays of charmed particles. This study is of importance to km 3 detectors of high energy cosmic neutrinos (For a review see, for example, ref. <ref> [9] </ref>). A full simulation, which would be of use for comparisons to experiments, is estimated to take approximately a CPU month on a ten Gigaflop cluster. 4.2 Use by KTEV The KTEV group at UCLA consists of Profs. Arisaka and Slater and two postdocs.

Reference-contexts: Another instance where improved local computing facilities would benefit is the area of fluid-based calculations of detonation scencarios for disruptive plasma instabilities <ref> [11] </ref>. These calculations are important for understanding rapid energy release in fusion devices as well as in natural phenomena such as solar flares. Typical detonation simulations take about 2-3 days on existing local workstations.
