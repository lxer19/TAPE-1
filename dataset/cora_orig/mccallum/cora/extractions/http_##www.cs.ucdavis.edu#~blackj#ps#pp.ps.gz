Reference-contexts: for some simple graph G, the number of isomorphism classes is given by Oberschelp's formula: jU (n)j = 2 ) [1 + O (n 2 =2 n )] So the number of isomorphism classes grows very fast as n increases; furthermore, it's a very difficult problem to determine these classes <ref> [1] </ref>. But the number of isomorphism classes for maximal planar graphs should be far less, although I know of neither a formula for the number of them nor a method for generating them.

Reference-contexts: There seems to be no obvious correlation between degree sequences which are planar graphical and those which are not. For example, 6 p4 3 4 is planar graphical iff p 8 and p is even <ref> [2] </ref>. Some believe there is not likely to exist a "pure" characterization of planar graphical degree sequences; but perhaps an algorithm-based characterization exists. I intend to spend some time this Summer investigating this further.

Reference-contexts: L. Hakimi in 1963 <ref> [3] </ref>. A simple necessary condition for a degree sequence to be planar graphical is as follows: if is planar graphical then n X d i 6 (n 2) (1) This result follows easily from Euler's formula for planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: Owens went on to characterize all regular planar graphical degree sequences. 1 If a degree sequence satisfies (1) we term an Euler sequence. Hawkins, Hill, Reeve and Tyrell <ref> [4] </ref> have determined completely which regular Euler sequences are planar graphical. They proved the following: every regular, graphical, Euler sequence is planar graphical except for 4 7 and 5 14 . The sequence is a k-sequence if d 1 d n = k.

Reference-contexts: Hakimi asked if this condition might also be sufficient; this question was answered in the negative by Owens in 1971 <ref> [5] </ref> when he showed that 4 7 is not planar graphical (here we use the notation d n to mean the degree sequence composed of the integer d repeated n times).

Reference-contexts: They proved the following: every regular, graphical, Euler sequence is planar graphical except for 4 7 and 5 14 . The sequence is a k-sequence if d 1 d n = k. In 1977, Schmeichel and Hakimi <ref> [6] </ref> determined completely which 1-sequences are planar graphical, and further determined (with a few unresolved cases) which 2-sequences are planar graphical. As of 1996, there is still no full characterization. 2 Discussion 2.1 Overview I investigated this problem for few days.
