Abstract: This work extends the metaphor of a see-through interface embodied in Magic Lenses TM to 3D environments. We present two new see-through visualization techniques: at lenses in 3D and volumetric lenses. We discuss implementation concerns for platforms that have programmer accessible hardware clipping planes and show several examples of each visualization technique. We also examine composition of multiple lenses in 3D environments, which strengthens the at lens metaphor, but may have no meaningful semantics in the case of volumetric lenses.

Reference-contexts: By using hardware to subdivide the polygons and by rendering objects multiple times, we can implement at lenses in 3D applications. The rendering hardware of the Silicon Graphics Reality Engine 2 <ref> [1] </ref>, allows programmers to define up to six infinite cutting planes.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Magic lenses <ref> [2] </ref> are transparent user interface elements for windowing desktop environments that extend the metaphor of a magnifying glass to include any sort of useful visual transformation of application data. <p> FUTURE DIRECTIONS This work is concerned with the output characteristics of 3D lenses and we have only begun to think about the input modifications that a 3D toolglass <ref> [2] </ref> might offer. Reaching into a space for access to a mode seems like a natural extension to the existing 2D lens metaphor, and will clearly have to be pursued with an eye toward two-handed interaction [5]. <p> RELATED WORK Magic Lenses and Toolglasses <ref> [2] </ref> use two-dimensional see-through widgets as tools for view filtering and visualization. This idea has been incorporated into many systems including Pad++ [3] and Self [12] and the most recent version of the popular Kais Power Tools for Adobe Photoshop.

Several systems have demonstrated the utility of using three dimensional objects as data filters.
