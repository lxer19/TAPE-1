Title: Sensor-Based Planning with the Freespace Assumption

Abstract: A popular technique for getting to a goal location in unknown terrain is planning with the freespace assumption. The robot assumes that the terrain is clear unless it knows otherwise. It always plans a shortest path to the goal location and re-plans whenever it detects an obstacle that blocks its path or, more generally, when it detects that its current path is no longer optimal. It has been unknown whether this sensor-based planning approach is worst-case optimal, given the lack of initial knowledge about the terrain. We demonstrate that planning with the freespace assumption can make good performance guarantees on some restricted graph topologies (such as grids) but is not worst-case optimal in general. For situations in which its performance guarantee is insufficient, we also describe an algorithm, called Basic-VECA, that exhibits good average-case performance and provides performance guarantees that are optimal up to a constant (user-defined) factor.

Reference-contexts: Its performance guarantee on graphs G = (V; E) is at most (k + 2) weight (G), i.e. O (weight (G)) for fixed k. The proof is given in <ref> [5] </ref>. The parameter k can be used to trade-off average-case and worst-case performance. The average-case performance of Basic-VECA is similar to that of planning with the freespace assumption for sufficiently large values of k; the larger the value of k is, the longer both algorithms behave the same.

Reference-contexts: Planning with the freespace assumption has been used on both grids and visibility graphs, but, different from other sensor-based planning algorithms <ref> [6] </ref>, it was unknown which performance guarantees it provides. While we care mostly about its average-case performance, it is also important that it provides a good performance guarantee because only then one can be certain that it performs well in all environments.

Reference-contexts: Thus, sensing during plan execution and using the acquired knowledge for re-planning, often called "sensor-based planning" [1], makes the planning problem tractable. A popular technique for sensor-based planning is planning with the freespace assumption [2] <ref> [8] </ref> [11] [14]: The robot assumes that the terrain is clear unless it knows otherwise. It always plans a shortest path from its current location to the goal location. <p> Figure 1 (right) shows the corresponding traversability graph. 1 Other robot navigation problems have been modeled in similar ways, for example the indoor navigation problem described in <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 The Freespace Assumption Planning with the freespace assumption is a greedy way for solving sensor-based planning problems: The robot always makes the optimistic assumption that vertices are unblocked if it does not know their status. <p> Consequently, reaching the goal vertex is impossible in this case. Planning with the freespace assumption has been used on actual robots. For example, it has been applied to the outdoor [13] and indoor <ref> [8] </ref> navigation problems mentioned above. Planning with the freespace assumption has several advantages: It is easy to implement.

Planning with the freespace assumption, a sensor-based planning approach, always plans a shortest path to the goal, assuming that the terrain is clear unless it knows otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Planning with the freespace assumption has several advantages: It is easy to implement. Its computations can be done efficiently. (The most time-consuming step is to re-calculate a shortest path after new knowledge about obstacles has been acquired and the Dynamic A* algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> does this without unnecessary re-calculations.) It immediately takes advantage of newly acquired knowledge and always uses all of its knowledge. Without any changes to the algorithm, it is able to use prior knowledge about blocked vertices. <p> The Basic Variable Edge Cost Algorithm (Basic-VECA, Figure 4) uses planning with the freespace assumption as a subroutine (tie breaker) in Step 3. It 3 Experimental results for planning with the freespace assumption are reported in <ref> [10] </ref>. Its average-case performance is very good, although recent experimental evidence [12] suggests that, at least in some domains, one can improve the total travel distance slightly by assuming that the status of a vertex is similar to the status of its neighbors instead of assuming that it is unblocked.

Reference-contexts: In the literature, this problem has been studied in the context of actual robot navigation problems. For example, the purpose of NAVLAB II, Carnegie Mellon's unmanned robot HMMWV, is to reach specified coordinates in unmapped static terrains <ref> [13] </ref>. To do so, the vehicle discretizes the unknown area into a coarse-resolution map of square cells. Each cell is either traversable or untraversable. The vehicle always occupies exactly one cell and can move in all eight compass directions to traversable adjacent cells. <p> Consequently, reaching the goal vertex is impossible in this case. Planning with the freespace assumption has been used on actual robots. For example, it has been applied to the outdoor <ref> [13] </ref> and indoor [8] navigation problems mentioned above. Planning with the freespace assumption has several advantages: It is easy to implement.
