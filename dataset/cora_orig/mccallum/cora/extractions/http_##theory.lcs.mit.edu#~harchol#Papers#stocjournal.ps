Abstract: Any packet-routing network can be formulated as a queueing network, where each server has a constant service time. If each server had exponentially-distributed service time, queueing theory techniques could be used to determine the expected packet delay. However, it is not known how to compute the average packet delay for all but the simplest networks with constant time servers. This paper shows that for a large class of networks, this conjecture is true, but that surprisingly there exists a network for which it is false. This large class of networks is all queueing networks with Markovian routing. Queueing networks with Markovian routing are important because they include many packet-routing networks where the packets are routed to random destinations.

Reference-contexts: (N C,FCFS ) AvgDelay (N E,FCFS ) 2 Observe that since the server in the queueing network represents an edge in the packet-routing network, all we need to know to determine the probabilities is the server (edge) at which the packet just finished serving. 7 Our proof is modeled after <ref> [ST94] </ref> who proved this result for layered Markovian networks. Whereas their proof uses induction on the levels of the network, we induct on time, thereby simplifying the proof and obviating the need for a layered network.
