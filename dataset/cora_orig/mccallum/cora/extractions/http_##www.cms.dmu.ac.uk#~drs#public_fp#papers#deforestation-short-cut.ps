Title: A Short Cut to Deforestation

Abstract: This paper is to appear in FPCA 1993. Abstract Lists are often used as "glue" to connect separate parts of a program together. We propose an automatic technique for improving the efficiency of such programs, by removing many of these intermediate lists, based on a single, simple, local transformation. We have implemented the method in the Glasgow Haskell compiler.
