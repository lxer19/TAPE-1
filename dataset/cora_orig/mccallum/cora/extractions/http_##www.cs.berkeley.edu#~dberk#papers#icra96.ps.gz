Abstract: We consider the problem of designing traditional (e.g. vibratory bowl) feeders for singulating and orienting industrial parts. Our ultimate goal is to prototype new designs using analytically- and geometrically-based methods. We have developed a tool for designing industrial parts feeders based on dynamic simulation. Our tool allows us to automatically perform multiple feeder design experiments, and to evaluate their outcomes. These results can then be used to compute the probabilities of a Markov model for the feeder. To demonstrate our technique, we present preliminary results for the design of two simple feeders. Our findings suggest that using dynamic simulation is a promising approach for designing parts feeders.

Reference-contexts: Asfahl presents a case study of this particular vibratory bowl feeder <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . In the digraph of Figure 2, transitions between successive levels correspond to feeder gates. The transitions out of the initial state represent the introduction of a block onto the feeder track. <p> This general criterion for evaluating a mechanical parts feeder is known as efficiency, and is defined as follows: efficiency = F out (1) where F out is the output feed rate of correctly oriented parts and F in is the total input feed rate <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . Future work will include a more analytic and automatic method for determining metric weights. We are also exploring more sophisticated criteria and formal methods for evaluating feeder designs.

Reference-contexts: This allows us to compute the probability that a part in a particular initial orientation will end up in the desired final orientation. In a similar way, Boothroyd uses probability matrices to compute the effects of feeder gates on parts <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> . As long as a feeder's gates are far enough apart not to interact, we can study their effects independently.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Vibratory bowl feeders and hopper feeders have proliferated industry as a cost-effective means for reliably orienting parts. These feeders and their transfer conveyors account for nearly one-third of the cost and failure risk of an assembly system <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> . However, the current design of these feeders is a black art, based merely on modifications to previous designs and empirical debugging rather than on theory and automated design. Parts are presented to feeders in bulk, and as a result, clustering and entanglement are common.
