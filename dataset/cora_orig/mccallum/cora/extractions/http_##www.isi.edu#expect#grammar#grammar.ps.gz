Reference-contexts: INSPECT is a knowledge-based system developed using ISI's EXPECT framework. The system checks the consistency of air campaign plans with respect to several criteria. INSPECT provides consistency checking for operational plans developed (or modified) using ACPT. For a detailed description of INSPECT, see <ref> [Valente et al., 1996] </ref>. The representation proposed in this document has as its main focus providing a richer and more structured representation for air campaign plan objectives than the one that is present in ACPT at the moment, specifically as needed by INSPECT and the other IFD-4 systems.
