Title: THE EFFICIENT COMPUTATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORMS ON THE SYMMETRIC GROUP  
Author: DAVID K. MASLEN 
Abstract: This paper introduces new techniques for the efficient computation of Fourier transforms on symmetric groups and their homogeneous spaces. We replace the matrix multiplications in Clausen's algorithm with sums indexed by combinatorial objects that generalize Young tableaux, and write the result in a form similar to Horner's rule. The algorithm we obtain computes the Fourier transform of a function on S n in no more than 3 4 n(n 1) jS n j multiplications and the same number of additions. Analysis of our algorithm leads to several combinatorial problems that generalize path counting. We prove corresponding results for inverse transforms and transforms on homogeneous spaces.

Fourier transforms on finite groups The Fourier transform of a function on the symmetric group and the usual discrete Fourier transform of a finite data sequence are both special cases of Fourier transforms on finite groups. <p> When the representations in R are unitary, all the multiplications occurring in our Fourier transform algorithms are by numbers of magnitude no greater than 1, so our results may be interpreted in terms of the 2-linear complexity of F R ; see <ref> [3] </ref> Chapter 3. The recent book of P. Burgisser, M. Clausen, and A. Shokrollahi [2] is a general reference for algebraic complexity theory that includes applications to Fourier transforms on groups. <p> To compute the inverse transform F 1 R , first apply D, as defined by (3.5) with G = S n , then apply I, and finally apply F T R _ using the transpose algorithm (see <ref> [3] </ref>, Chapter 3) of the algorithm of Theorem 3.1 for computing the Fourier transform at the set of dual representations R _ . The last step is possible because R _ is also adapted to the chain (3.1). <p> The last step is possible because R _ is also adapted to the chain (3.1). The map I is a re-indexing map, and requires no arithmetic operations to apply. The Fourier transform algorithm of Theorem 3.1 has the same number of outputs as inputs, so by <ref> [3] </ref> Theorem 3.10, the transpose algorithm takes exactly the same number of scalar operations as the Fourier transform algorithm of Theorem 3.1. <p> The use of Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases, the choice of factorizations for group elements or coset representatives, and the rearrangement of sums similar to Horner's rule are all well known tools for computing Fourier transforms on finite groups <ref> [3] </ref> and compact Lie groups [18]. Together they form the basis for the general `separation of variables' method for constructing Fourer transform algorithms [20] [21]. The construction of the bilinear maps in Section 4 may also be generalized to any finite group (or semisimple algebra).

Then the inverse image of the natural basis of L under the Fourier transform F R , is called the dual matrix coefficient basis for C [G] associated to R. Lemma 2.5 (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>). The computation of the Fourier transform F R f at a complete set of irreducible representations R is the same as computation of the sum X f (s)s (2.4) in the group algebra, relative to the dual matrix coefficient basis associated to R. Proof. <p> Systems of Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases were first defined in [13] for the calculation of the matrix coefficients of compact groups. The application to the efficient computation of Fourier transforms on finite groups was first noticed by Clausen <ref> [5] </ref> [6]. Example 2.7. If G is abelian, K is any subgroup of G, and R is any set of irreducible matrix representations of G, then R is K-adapted. 5 Example 2.8. <p> We can now relate the computation of a Fourier transform at an adapted set of representations to a collection of Fourier transforms on a subgroup. This idea was first due to Beth, and was developed by Clausen <ref> [5] </ref> [6], and Diaconis and Rockmore [10]. Before giving a precise statement we must introduce some notation. Assume K is a subgroup of G, R is a K-adapted set of matrix representations of G, and Y is a subset of G. <p> Therefore the Fourier transform of a complex function on S n may be computed in no more than 3n (n1) scalar operations. Prop. 4 easily implies that the number of multiplications required by our algorithm is the same as the number of additions. Remark 3.2. Clausen's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> calculates the products t i+1 t n F i occurring in (3.2) by matrix multiplication of the corresponding matrices in the order from right to left. <p> Remark 6.5. Theorem 6.4 is an improvement on the result of Maslen and Rockmore ([20], Theorem 6.5), which was obtained by applying Clausen's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> to a right invariant function on the symmetric group. They showed that the Fourier transform of a complex function on S n =S nk could be computed at an adapted set of representations in no more than k 3 (k 2 1) jS n =S nk j scalar operations.

Reference-contexts: Proof. These are standard facts about Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases; see e.g., <ref> [14] </ref> Proposition 2.3.12 for a proof in different notation. Equation (4.5) follows immediately from the definition of adaptedness to S n and S n1 , since it describes the correct block diagonal matrices. <p> The main observation is that Young's lattice may be replaced by other Bratteli diagrams. Let N denote the non-negative integers. A Bratteli diagram (see <ref> [14] </ref> and [26]) is a connected N-graded multigraph such that (i) Each level (vertices with the same grading) has only finitely many vertices, and finitely many edges connected to it.

The Bratteli diagram of a tower of group algebras is locally free. Several other combinatorial results for Young's lattice also extend to locally free Bratteli diagrams: In particular, the theorems of Stanley ([24] Theorem 3.7 and [25] Theorem 2.7) which count the number of paths in a differential poset, which start and end at , hold in this more general setting. See [21] for a more detailed treatment of these and similar results. 6. <p> The methods used in Section 4 also raise some combinatorial questions. Walks generalizing (4.11) have already been studied on Young's lattice and other posets [24] <ref> [25] </ref>, but the appearance of multiply-connected configurations, e.g., (4.9) and (4.17), appears to be a new phenomenon; also see [18] and [20]. More generally, one may consider mappings from any graded diagram into a Bratteli diagram.

Reference-contexts: The main observation is that Young's lattice may be replaced by other Bratteli diagrams. Let N denote the non-negative integers. A Bratteli diagram (see [14] and <ref> [26] </ref>) is a connected N-graded multigraph such that (i) Each level (vertices with the same grading) has only finitely many vertices, and finitely many edges connected to it. (ii) Edges only connect adjacent levels, and if two adjacent levels are nonempty, then the bipartite graph, consisting of those two levels and
