Title: A Remark on Matrix Rigidity  
Author: M.A. Shokrollahi, D.A. Spielman, and V. Stemann 
Keyword: Key words. Matrix rigidity, circuit complexity, communication complexity

Abstract: The rigidity of a matrix is defined to be the number of entries in the matrix that have to be changed in order to reduce its rank below a certain value. Using a simple combinatorial lemma, we show that one must alter at least c n 2 r entries of an nfin-Cauchy matrix to reduce its rank below r, for some constant c. In the second part of the paper we apply our combinatorial lemma to matrices obtained from asymptotically good algebraic geometric codes to obtain a similar result for r satisfying 2n=( p

Reference-contexts: It is well known that if G has more than (r 1) r (n r + 1)n 1 1 edges, then G contains a K (r; r) subgraph (see, e.g., <ref> [1, p. 310] </ref>). It is straightforward to check that this condition is satisfied for R &lt; (n; r). 2 In the sequel we will use the above lemma in the following form. Corollary 2.2. Let log 2 n r n 2 and let n be sufficiently large.

Reference-contexts: This implies that these matrices are highly rigid. Similar results can be obtained for n fi n-matrices defined over the rationals in which the entries are very large integers, see <ref> [2, Chapters 9 and 13] </ref>. Researchers have had less success in finding explicit highly rigid matrices with entries from a fixed finite set or even a field of size polynomial in n (which we shall refer to as a small field).

Reference-contexts: For references to other applications see the paper by Lokam [6]. Lickteig <ref> [5] </ref> has shown that multiplication of vectors by n fi n-matrices in which the entries are square roots of distinct primes cannot be performed by a linear circuit of size O (n 2 = log n). This implies that these matrices are highly rigid.
