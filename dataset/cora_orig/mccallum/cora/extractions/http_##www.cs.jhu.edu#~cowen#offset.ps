Abstract: This paper is concerned with the analysis of locally time-synchronized slot systems for broadcast in packet radio networks. Local synchronization has been proposed in practice as less expensive than global synchronization over very wide areas, or over mobile networks. In the case of two locally coordinated groups of stations, under the assumption that the phase shift on the clocks between the two groups is random, it is shown that the probability of no collision is maximized when occupied slots within each group are chosen consecutively, regardless of the number of total slots, or the number of occupied slots in either group.

Reference-contexts: The channel is usually divided into slots of equal length, each accommodating control bits and a data packet of a single user. This is the basic idea employed in early communication networks ( see <ref> [1, 8] </ref>). Later intelligent cruise control systems require a periodic exchange of information between vehicles on just one radio channel, e.g., position, velocity, warnings, and other status reports. A reasonable strategy divides time into periodically repeated frames, each consisting of n slots.

Reference-contexts: There are protocols which have been developed to coordinate a group of local stations, so they select different time-slots, e.g. CSAP and its successors <ref> [2, 3, 6] </ref>.

This of course consumes channel capacity and deteriorates the overall network performance. Current local implementations of, e.g. CSAP <ref> [6, 2] </ref> place stations randomly within each local group. In this case, [4] obtained a closed form representation for the expected throughput of the channel.

In this paper, we show that a random assignment of occupied slots is not the best strategy to maximize the probability of no collision. <p> Since it is easy to pick slot placement within each coordinated group any way we please, this results in a substantial increase in throughput from the random distribution that would come from a local implementation of, e.g. CSAP <ref> [6, 2] </ref>. 2. Main Result Without loss of generality, we take a clock period of one time unit, and set the frame starting time for group A to 0.

Reference-contexts: Cowen and R. Mathar that each station in the group applies the same frame and slot starting points. A recent paper of <ref> [5] </ref> suggested overcoming these problems by interpreting transmitters as pulse-coupled oscillators. However, it is usually not feasible to employ a central station to control an overall global synchronization of time.
