Abstract: Several methods of increasing the speed and simplicity of the computation of off-axis transmission holograms are presented, with applications to the real-time display of holographic images. A bipolar intensity approach enables a linear summation of interference fringes, a factor of two speed increase, and the elimination of image noise caused by object self-interference. An order of magnitude speed increase is obtained through the use of precomputed look-up tables containing a large array of elemental interference patterns corresponding to point source contributions from each of the possible locations in image space. Results achieved using a data-parallel supercomputer to compute horizontal-parallax-only holographic patterns containing 6 megasamples indicate that an image comprised of 10,000 points with arbitrary brightness (grayscale) can be computed in under one second.

In any real-time display system, a computer-generated hologram (CGH) must be computed as quickly as possible in order to provide for dynamic and interactive images.

Reference-contexts: In general, light diffracts from a three-dimensional object to the hologram plane. Since the analytical expressions that model diffractive propagation through free space resemble the Fourier transform integral, computation of holographic interference patterns often utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. Though relatively fast, this approach is useful only for images possessing discrete depth surfaces [5, 6], and becomes slow when applied to images that extend throughout an image volume.

Reference-contexts: Anti-aliasing is therefore accomplished by limiting the minimum and maximum angles of incidence of object light. In addition to anti-aliasing, the range of direction of object light propagation is used for the purposes of image occlusion and advanced image lighting models <ref> [8] </ref>, resulting in a more realistic looking image. The information content of a CGH must be reduced to a size and format that can be manipulated by existing computers.

Reference-contexts: Within the region of contribution, the phase of the object wavefront, F p (x), is approximated as a spherical wave <ref> [9] </ref> centered at the point source location: F p (x) = k r p (x) + p where r p (x) = [(x x p ) 2 + z 2 p ] 2 where r p (x) is the oblique distance to a location on the holo-line and is a function

Reference-contexts: No reference beam ratio needs to be specified during computation, and bias buildup is not an issue. Compare this bipolar intensity method to the physical process occurring in some photorefractive crystals <ref> [10] </ref> (e.g. lithium niobate), in which uniform (DC) intensity is not recorded due to the material's negligible response to intensity patterns with low spatial frequencies. Researchers exploit this absence of bias build-up in order to sequentially expose multiple holographic intensity patterns.

Reference-contexts: However, this is a common case, and is applicable to many display architectures. In general, this contraction of rank is especially useful when implemented on a standard serial-processing computer. Application to the Computation of Stereograms For some applications, a stereogram <ref> [11] </ref> approach may be desirable when presenting three-dimensional images. In general, a stereogram consists of a series of two-dimensional object views differing in horizontal point-of-view. These views are presented to the viewer in the correct horizontal location, resulting in the depth cues of stereopsis and (horizontal) motion parallax.
