Abstract: In this paper, we report the design and implementation of a software suite called NetEx (short for Network Express) that can provide connection-oriented delay-guaranteed communication services at application level . With NetEx, user applications request connection setup by specifying their traffic (using some standard traffic descriptors) and quality of service (e.g., delay bound). NetEx runs a connection admission control (CAC) algorithm to check if the new connection can be accepted. NetEx integrates network wide admission control with host runtime traffic control to facilitate application-to-application delay-guaranteed communication. The modular design and implementation of NetEx allows it to also serve as a software testbed to experiment different network management techniques.

Reference-contexts: the following results: G (I) = (I+d ) G (I +d )/I (6) That is, we can express the output traffic, G i,j (I), in terms of the input traffic, G i,j (I) and the delay, d i,j . (6) follows directly from the delay property of maximum rate function <ref> [1] </ref>. Using (6), subsequent servers can be analyzed. Once all the delays at individual servers are obtained, we can substitute (5) into (2) to compute the network delay for connection j. 4. <p> , (I d ) * (I d )) / I max sender sender = + +G (11) UDP/IP AAL Applications Applications Applications HTM DD ATM Applications Applications Applications Network Traffic Manager Application Programming Interface Host Host Network Equation (11) is a direct consequence of delay property of maximum rate function <ref> [1] </ref> and the fact that S max trivial upper bound on the output traffic. We assume that the delay in the protocol stack of the host is constant. So G (I) is the same traffic that shows up at the entrance of the AAL layer.

Reference-contexts: We propose to provide connection-oriented and delay-guaranteed communication services for distributed mission critical systems at the application level. To achieve our objective, various network and host resource management techniques have been developed <ref> [5, 11-13] </ref>. These techniques are now realized in a software tool kit, NetEx. We describe the design and implementation of NetEx and address the fundamental technical issues associated with it. NetEx comprises of Host Traffic Manager (HTM) and Network Traffic Manager (NTM). <p> With this method, the ATM network is decomposed into a set of servers. A server can be a link, or a component of an ATM switch <ref> [5, 11] </ref>. Delays of ATM cells at each server are analyzed. The network delay of a cell from a particular connection is then the summation of the delays of servers the connection passes through. Formally, let G j be the set of indices of servers which connection j passes through. <p> In traditional networks, stochastic models have been used to describe traffic. They can evaluate average performance of networks. But they are not adequate for hard real-time systems, which require worst case analysis. For hard real real-time system, the maximum rate function, G (I), has been used successfully <ref> [5] </ref>. We have also adopted the maximum rate function to describe traffic internally in NetEx. The maximum rate function is defined as the maximum data arrival rate in a time interval of length I units. <p> For variable servers, we will only demonstrate how to analyze a multiplexer with FIFO scheduling policy. Analysis of other variable servers and scheduling policies are not given here due to space 4 limitation. Interested readers may refer to <ref> [5] </ref>. Let server i be a multiplexer with FIFO scheduling policy. Let W i be the set of indices of connections that pass through server i.

Reference-contexts: From an implementation standpoint, several protocols have also been proposed for guaranteed services on networks. Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) <ref> [8 ] </ref> is a receiver-oriented setup protocol for connectionless networks for providing Quality of Service ( QoS) guarantees. ATM Forum's UNI 2 Signaling protocol (derived from ITU-T Q.2931) describes QoS and traffic parameters specification procedures [9]. 2.

Overview of NetEx Traffic Control Strategy In this section, we will first discuss two important control components involved in providing delay-guaranteed services at the application level. These components are system connection admission control (CAC) and host runtime traffic control (RTTC).

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of efficiency, i n the current version of NetEx, a route with the shortest path is used. Our performance study has found that this method performs reasonably well in comparison with others while having a minimum runtime overhead <ref> [10] </ref>. 3. Delay derivation and testing. This is the most critical step. We first derive the delay bound of the new connection and then test if it is no more than the deadline requested. <p> The deadline is then partitioned in proportion to the load parameters. The host with a heavier load is given a larger sub-deadline, thus relatively balancing load among the hosts. The detailed partition method is not presented here due to space limitation, but can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. 4.3 Host Delay and Buffer Requirements For a connection on a particular host, we introduce two functions: the minimum service function S min maximum service function S max (I). <p> For a complete proof, see <ref> [10] </ref>. Delay and buffer requirement at the receiver can be derived similarly.

Reference-contexts: Approximation methods have been proposed to avoid these limitations <ref> [12] </ref>. In particular, the point approximation method is used to construct an approximate G (I) when traffic information at limited number of points are given. Our experiments have shown that a six-point approximation can characterize real traffic with good precision [12 ]. <p> Approximation methods have been proposed to avoid these limitations [12].
