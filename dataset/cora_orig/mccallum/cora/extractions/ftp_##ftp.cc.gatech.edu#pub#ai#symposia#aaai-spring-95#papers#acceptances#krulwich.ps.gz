Title: Cognitive behavior, basic levels, and intelligent agents A position paper for the 1995 Spring Symposium
Author: Bruce Krulwich

Abstract: This paper argues that the notion of basic levels of representation applies to the representation of mental processes. For such representations to be applicable across domains, they must be at a level that is abstract enough to be independent of domain details, but concrete enough to have agreed-upon interpretations. We then present the research area of intelligent software agents as allowing a separation between a representation of a mental process from the execution of the process. This allows the model of the process to exist at a basic level, while providing the basis for effective reasoning about mental activity.
