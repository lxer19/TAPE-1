Abstract: This paper discusses the role of fuzzy databases in catalytic inference analysis. In knowledge discovery and inference control applications, it is important to represent common sense knowledge explicitly in the databases being analyzed. Such knowledge, typically expressed in fuzzy terms, can be introduced as catalytic relations. Analyzing the resulting augmented databases materializes new rules and latent compromising inference channels based on common knowledge and database data.

Reference-contexts: This paper deals with catalytic inference based on functional dependencies (FDs). A special model is used for "classicalizing" fuzzy relations to maximize interoperability and integration with precise databases. For simplicity, tuple membership is assumed to be a Boolean property. Extending tuple membership to fuzzy sets on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is accomplished by treating it as a separate attribute [7,9]. 2. Abstract Relational Model "Contexts" or partitions on database domains are used to define domain integrity. They control the imprecision of legal fuzzy tuple components.

Reference-contexts: Definition: A database relation r with underlying scheme R (A;C) is a set of non-redundant tuples with respect to the contexts in C. Entity integrity is maintained in a fuzzy (or precise) relation by "merging" a block of redundant tuples into a single non-redundant tuple <ref> [2] </ref>. Definition: The merge of two tuples t and t 0 is given by u = (u 1 ; u 2 ; :::; u n ) where u i = t i [ t 0 i . 3.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 3.1: The fuzzy FD: X (C X ) ! Y (C Y ) is a classical FD when C X and C Y are precise. Proposition 3.2: Fuzzy FDs satisfy Armstrong's axioms (Reflexivity, Augmentation, Transitivity). In addition to Armstrong's axioms, new axioms specific to fuzzy FDs exist <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Fuzzy inference channels are composed of a use set of fuzzy FDs <ref> [3] </ref>. To simplify inference channel detection, nonlinear inference channels can be modeled as combinations of linear channels.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Imprecise inference generalizes precise inference in that it models the ability to infer sets of values or "inference chunks." It is widespread in precise databases and plays an important role in knowledge discovery and database security. Imprecise inference analysis can "mine" rules from database data <ref> [4] </ref>. In security applications, it helps determine whether or not a database system is free from "inference attacks" [3,5,6,8]. This paper considers the problem of catalytic inference analysis. Common sense knowledge possessed by users must be included explicitly in database inference analysis.

Reference-contexts: A context also determines fuzzy equivalence. Since an equivalence class (sieve opening) is comprised of indistinguishable elements, all consistent "chunks" passing through the same sieve opening are equivalent. Fuzzy equivalence reduces to classical equality in precise contexts. This notion of equivalence also captures the fuzzy resemblance measure EQUAL in <ref> [7] </ref>. Definition: Tuples t and t 0 are redundant with respect to contexts C = (C 1 ; C 2 ; :::; C n ), i.e., t ~ C t 0 , whenever t i ~ (C i ;ff=1:0) t 0 i for each component i.
