Title: CONTEXT-DEPENDENT HYBRID HME/HMM SPEECH RECOGNITION USING POLYPHONE CLUSTERING DECISION TREES

Abstract: This paper presents a context-dependent hybrid connectionist speech recognition system that uses a set of generalized hierarchical mixtures of experts (HME) to estimate context-dependent posterior acoustic class probabilities. The connectionist part of the system is organized in a modular fashion, allowing the distributed training of such a system on regular workstations. Context classes are based on polyphonic contexts, clustered using decision trees which we adopt from our continuous density HMM recognizer JANUS [8]. The system is evaluated on ESST, an english speaker-independent spontaneous speech database. Context dependent modeling is shown to yield significant improvements over simple context-independent modeling, requiring only small additional overhead in terms of training and decoding time.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION It was recently shown by a variety of researchers (eg. <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref>) that hybrid HMM systems which rely on connectionist discriminative acoustic modeling can be competitive with traditional mixtures of Gaussians based HMM systems, yet requiring orders of magnitude less parameters. Such systems are attractive, because they are compact and offer faster decoding speeds than standard systems.

Reference-contexts: The modular aspect of HME's bears similarities to the Meta-Pi paradigm <ref> [3] </ref> with the difference, that the training data is not partioned a-priori among experts in an HME Instead, the network learns smooth feature space par tionings without supervision by maximizing the likelihood of a generative statistical model.

As in <ref> [7] </ref>, we use phonetic decision trees to cluster phonetic contexts. However, our work differs in two aspects: (1) our system clusters polyphone instead of just triphone contexts, (2) the decision trees are adopted from a continuous density HMM system.

The system uses 3-state left-right HMM's and 51 monophones. The connectionist part consists of one state discriminating HME, 3 monophone HME's and 3x51 context expert HME's.
