Abstract: This report investigates the effect of low frame rate on human performance in a desktop virtual environment. This is done using an objective measure of users' ability to perform a simple heading task at various frame rates (2.3-14.2 Hz). Two principal experiments are presented. The first experiment shows that for a drop in frame rate from 11.5 Hz to 2.3 Hz, users' accuracy and time to complete the task degraded significantly. The second experiment reveals a continuous, asymptotic relationship between frame rate and performance for the chosen task. At low frame rates (up to 10-15 Hz) there is a sharp improvement in performance as frame rate increases. After around 15 Hz this increase is substantially less rapid. The results provide evidence for reinforcing that a minimum frame rate of around 15 Hz is necessary for virtual environments, but also that further increases in frame rate will continue to yield greater performance levels, albeit at a much reduced rate.

Reference-contexts: Smets and Overbeeke, 1995; Swartz et al., 1992). For example, taking the case of transport delay, lags of between 30-120 ms have been shown to degrade user performance, depending upon the application <ref> (Held and Durlach, 1993) </ref>. Singhal and Cheriton (1995) state that humans can detect network lags of around 100 ms in a distributed VR system, and will only tolerate maximum inconsistencies in the order of 200 ms.

Reference-contexts: Gregory (1990) also reports that a lag of around 500 ms can seriously degrade hand-eye coordination tasks such as drawing and writing. Frame rate degradation can also affect user performance in a VE <ref> (Lampton et al., 1994) </ref>. (In fact, Bryson, 1993, reports that the effect of both frame rate and transport delay on the user's ability to perform a particular tracking task was quantitatively similar).

Reference-contexts: This can be explained, at least in part, by the temporal aliasing and perceptual distortions caused by high latency systems which can deteriorate a user's depth and egomotion perception <ref> (Piantanida et al., 1993) </ref>. As a result, it is generally agreed that frame rate is more important than display fidelity in VEs (e.g. Smets and Overbeeke, 1995; Swartz et al., 1992).

Reference-contexts: It is also worth noting that this type of heading experiment, as well as having been used by numerous vision scientists in the past, has also been used by researchers in the field of VR to assess the performance of subjects within a VE <ref> (e.g. Wann et al., 1995) </ref>. The experiment is of course completely passive: the user does not manipulate the navigated course in any way.
