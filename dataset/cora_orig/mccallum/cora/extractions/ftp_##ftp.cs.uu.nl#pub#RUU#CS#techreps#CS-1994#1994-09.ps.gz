Reference-contexts: Our proof techniques for this case use recent geometric results of Matousek et al. [16] and van Kreveld [18] about the arrangements of fat geometric objects. Our result generalizes the case considered by Bhattacharya et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, where the obstacles form a single simple polygon. In the second situation, we consider a collection of k polygonal goal regions of total complexity m, but without any obstacles.

Reference-contexts: For a detailed discussion see the recent book by Latombe [13]. In computational geometry such a model of uncertainty was used for planning compliant motions within a polygonal environment in the works of Briggs <ref> [2] </ref>, Donald [3], and Friedman and others [8, 9]. Most recently Latombe and Lazanas [14] used this model to develop a complete planner for an environment consisting of circular initial, goal, and obstacle regions, as well as circular landmark regions in which the robot has perfect sensing and control.

Reference-contexts: So, it will be sufficient to prove that the complexity of all these pairwise unions is O (n=ff 3 ). We now use the combination lemma by Edelsbrunner et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. It states that the complexity of the union of two polygonal regions R and R 0 is bounded by the complexities of the two components plus the number of holes in R [ R 0 .

Reference-contexts: This takes O (km) time. Next we compute the set L of lines tangent to two polygons; it is straightforward to do this in O (km) time. We then construct the arrangement A (L) in O (k 4 ) time <ref> [5] </ref>. So the first stage of the algorithm takes O (k 4 + km) time in total. The second stage of the algorithm is as follows. For every cell c in A (L) we compute its visibility cycle V c .

Reference-contexts: Pick some point x in the cell, replace every B i by a suitable segment s i (such that the view of B i from x is the same as the view of s i ) and compute the visibility polygon of x in the resulting set of segments <ref> [6] </ref>. Next, compute in O (k 2 ) time a two-dimensional array A c such that A c [i; j] is true if and only if B i and B j are in the same connected component of the visibility cycle V c .

Reference-contexts: We are interested in the region from which a certain goal can be reached under these circumstances, and in its complexity and computation. Such a model was first proposed by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor [15] and was further developed in Erdmann's thesis <ref> [7] </ref> at MIT.

Reference-contexts: In order to obtain a radiosity solution, the environment needs to be meshed, and this meshing needs to be done in accordance with discontinuities in the illumination function. See Heckbert <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. In the present paper, we consider two special cases of the general problem presented above. In the first situation, we consider a single goal region, namely the "region at infinity", and a set of polygonal obstacles, modeled as a set S of n disjoint line segments.

Reference-contexts: Thus within every cell the region is equal to the union of O (km) discs, which has O (km) complexity <ref> [12] </ref>. Since A (L) has O (k 4 ) cells the total complexity of R ff (B) is O (k 5 m).

Reference-contexts: In practice, however, we can assume that ff is bounded from below by some constant. Under this condition, we obtain a much better complexity of O (n=ff 5 ). Our proof techniques for this case use recent geometric results of Matousek et al. <ref> [16] </ref> and van Kreveld [18] about the arrangements of fat geometric objects. Our result generalizes the case considered by Bhattacharya et al. [1], where the obstacles form a single simple polygon. <p> These regions cannot have any long and skinny parts|after all, they are unions of (infinitely many) ff-cones, so the value of ff gives a lower bound on the "skinniness" of R ff;~u (S). In fact, this is the concept of fatness employed by Matousek et al. <ref> [16] </ref> and van Kreveld [18]. They have proven results on the number of holes in the union of fat regions, which can in turn be used to bound the complexity of their union. Unfortunately, these results are only proven for polygonal regions, and our regions are bounded by circular segments. <p> It follows that we can cover R 0 ff;~u (S) and R 00 ff;~u (S) with O (n) fi-fat triangles with fi cff for some constant c &gt; 0. Now we can apply a result by Matousek et al. <ref> [16] </ref> which states that the union of n fi-fat triangles has at most O (n=fi 3 ) holes.

Reference-contexts: If there is a relevant disc that completely contain c then we add the whole cell to R ff (S). Otherwise, we compute the union of the discs inside c, which can be done in O ((jcj+jD c j) log (jcj+jD c j)) randomized time <ref> [17] </ref>. From the results of the previous subsection we know that P c jD c j = O (k 3 m). So this takes O (k 3 m log m) time in total. We conclude with the following theorem.

We use the technique by van Kreveld <ref> [18] </ref>.
