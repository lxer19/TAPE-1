Abstract: In an MPEG encoder, three types of frames (I , P, and B) are periodically generated according to a pre-specified compression pattern. As a result, an MPEG sequence is periodic in its compression pattern, and this periodicity can be used to reduce the bandwidth requirements of multiplexed MPEG streams. By exploiting the deterministic and periodic nature of the compression pattern, we show that it is possible to provide stringent deterministic guarantees (no cell losses and no queueing delay) to MPEG connections without the need to allocate the peak rates of individual sources. Instead, a stream is allocated its effective bandwidth, which is the aggregate peak rate of the multiplexed streams divided by the number of streams. The aggregate peak rate depends on the arrangement of the multiplexed streams which is a measure of the degree of synchronization among the compression patterns of different streams. It is found that in most cases, the effective bandwidth is smaller than the source peak rate. For a given arrangement, we provide a procedure to compute the effective bandwidth. We also give an expression for the `best' arrangement that results in the `optimal' effective bandwidth. Examples of real MPEG sequences are used to show the bandwidth gains that can be achieved through proper scheduling of the starting times of MPEG connections.

Reference-contexts: The notion of effective bandwidth (also known as equivalent capacity) was investigated in several previous studies in a stochastic framework (for example, see [4] and <ref> [1] </ref>). In this paper, the effective bandwidth is used in a deterministic framework to guarantee zero cell loss rate and no queueing delays.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we will ignore the first few frames in a stream, and assume, for simplicity, that frame types in an MPEG stream are represented by exact replications of the compression pattern. 2.2 Deterministic Traffic Model Several traffic models were proposed for the characterization of compressed video traffic (see <ref> [2] </ref> and the references therein). Most of these models are probabilistic in nature, and thus, cannot be used to provide deterministic guarantees. To support deterministic QoS requirements, which is the focus of this paper, a deterministic model for an MPEG source is needed.

Reference-contexts: Typically, a stream with deterministic QoS requirements (e.g., no cell losses) is not statistically multiplexed with other streams. Depending on its delay requirement, such a stream is either allocated its peak rate, or (if the some buffering delay can be tolerated) its peak rate over a finite interval <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we focus on compressed video streams that are generated by MPEG encoders. We show that, contrary to the general belief, statistical multiplexing can be used to an advantage with this type of traffic while providing stringent and deterministic QoS guarantees. <p> To support deterministic QoS requirements, which is the focus of this paper, a deterministic model for an MPEG source is needed. Intuitively, a deterministic characterization can be constructed using bounds on the actual bit rate. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Knightly et al. proposed a simple deterministic approach to characterize a VBR stream using a traffic constraint function. The same methodology is adopted in this paper, and is explained below. <p> We verified that by examining the traces of several MPEG-compressed movies. The movies are listed in Table 2.

Table 2 gives the maximum frames sizes (in cells) for each trace, the compression parameters, and the limit on the statistical multiplexing gain (given as a percentage of the source peak rate).

Reference-contexts: Maximum values for frame sizes were taken from the frame-size trace of the Wizard of Oz movie which was compressed using an MPEG encoder <ref> [6] </ref>. Accordingly, I max = 894, P max = 742, and B max = 157 (in cells). It is clear that except for one possible arrangement, u = (0; 0; 0), statistical multiplexing can reduce the bandwidth requirements without sacrificing any performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: A scene can be loosely defined as a segment of the movie with relatively consistent level of activity. Sizes of I frames (similarly, P and B frames) within a scene are close is value. Since on the average a scene lasts for several seconds <ref> [7] </ref>, changing the compression pattern (whose time scale is smaller than one second) will have little effect on the maximum sizes of I , P , and B frames within a scene.
