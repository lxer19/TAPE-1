Title: NetCash: A design for practical electronic currency on the Internet  
Author: Gennady Medvinsky B. Clifford Neuman 
Affiliation: Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California  
Abstract: NetCash is a framework that supports realtime electronic payments with provision of anonymity over an unsecure network. It is designed to enable new types of services on the Internet which have not been practical to date because of the absence of a secure, scalable, potentially anonymous payment method. NetCash strikes a balance between unconditionally anonymous electronic currency, and signed instruments analogous to checks that are more scalable but identify the principals in a transaction. It does this by providing the framework within which proposed electronic currency protocols can be integrated with the scalable, but non-anonymous, electronic banking infrastructure that has been proposed for routine transactions.

For some transactions, weaker forms of anonymity may be appropriate, e.g. traceability can be made difficult enough that the cost of obtaining such information outweighs the benefit.

Reference-contexts: It is also important to protect parties that receive payment in certain situations, such as rewards. Many protocols have been proposed for anonymous transactions, among them those by Chaum <ref> [2] </ref>. These protocols typically require a central bank that is involved in all transactions. In this paper, we present a framework for electronic transactions that combines the benefits of anonymous transactions with the scalability of non-anonymous online payment protocols. <p> Unfortunately, electronic currency is just data and is easily copied. Copying or double spending of currency should be prevented or detected. Ideally, the illegal creation, copying, and reuse of electronic cash should be unconditionally or computation-ally impossible. Some systems rely instead on post-fact detection and punishment of double spending <ref> [2] </ref>. Anonymity: The identity of an individual using electronic currency should be protected; it should not be possible to monitor an individual's spending patterns, nor determine one's source of income. An individual is traceable in traditional transaction systems such as checks and credit cards. <p> An individual is traceable in traditional transaction systems such as checks and credit cards.

For some transactions, weaker forms of anonymity may be appropriate, e.g. traceability can be made difficult enough that the cost of obtaining such information outweighs the benefit. <p> The mechanisms used to detect double spending also affects scalability. Most proposed e-cash protocols assume that the currency server will record all coins that have been previously spent and check this list when verifying a transaction <ref> [2, 6, 7] </ref>. This database will grow over time, increasing the cost to detect double spending. <p> Acceptability: Most e-cash proposals use a single bank <ref> [2, 6, 7] </ref>. In practice, multiple banks are needed for scalability, and because not all users will be customers of a single bank. In such an environment, it is important that currency minted by one bank be accepted by others. <p> Many of these proposals are variants of and improvements upon proposals by Chaum <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Although these protocols address many of the the requirements from section 2, unconditional anonymity is achieved at the expense of scalability, and acceptability is unaddressed. NetCash provides scalability and acceptability with weaker anonymity and only a limited form of o*ine-operation. <p> The primary contribution of NetCash is as a framework for integrating anonymous electronic currency into the global banking and accounting infrastructure. Section 5 defines a practical electronic currency protocol that provides weaker anonymity than the unconditional anonymity provided by Chaum <ref> [2] </ref>. The framework is useful even where unconditional anonymity is required since the protocols implementing Chaum's currency can replace the basic building blocks of the protocol described in section 5, while leaving the basic framework intact. <p> Another approach to o*ine transactions is to use the protocol shown in figure 4 in conjunction with tamper-proof electronic wallets. Double spending is prevented by properties of the hardware. The problems with this approach was described in section 2. Currently, we are looking into incorporating Chaum's post-fact punishment scheme <ref> [2] </ref> into NetCash. Double spend 3 In case different coin denominations are desired, A could specify several amounts, and obtain a number of triplets each having a particular value. ing makes it statistically possible to determine the identity of a dishonest client.

Reference-contexts: Such transferability can improve anonymity, but it complicates the mechanism that assures security. Hardware independence: To prevent double spend-ing during o*ine operation, some e-cash protocols rely on tamper-proof hardware <ref> [4] </ref>. A drawback to this approach is that new technology might allow the compromise of such hardware, leaving users vulnerable to double spending. 3 Related work There have been numerous recent proposals for protocols to support unconditionally untraceable, electronic currency [6, 7].

Reference-contexts: For example, access to online documents might require payment of royalties. Many o*ine services that formerly relied on cash now use electronic payment methods. More recently, protocols have been proposed <ref> [5] </ref> to support online payment for such services over open networks. While these protocols are suitable for the vast majority of transactions, most do not protect the identities of the parties to a transaction. <p> We believe that for many transactions this is sufficient. Where unconditional anonymity or completely o*ine operation is required, our framework can be extended to integrate exchanges from other protocols. Protocols have been proposed that support scalable distributed accounting without anonymity <ref> [5] </ref>. These protocols provide an accounting infrastructure within which funds can be transferred between clients and servers. Because these protocols do not provide anonymity, they are not by themselves sufficient for our purposes in this paper. <p> The NetCash infrastructure is based on independently managed, distributed currency servers that provide a point of exchange between anonymous electronic currency and non-anonymous instruments such as electronic checks. In the framework, checks based on the global accounting infrastructure <ref> [5] </ref> tie together currency servers in different administrative domains, into a financial federation where currency minted by different servers is accepted. <p> The latter two services as well as verification of coins minted by other servers relies on the accounting infrastructure described in <ref> [5] </ref> and is not further described in this paper. <p> For the sake of clarity in our protocols, we refer to such non-anonymous transactions using this accounting infrastructure as the transfer of a check. The mechanics of the non-anonymous transfers will not be discussed here but can instead be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 5.1 Notation The participants in our protocols are: clients, merchants, and currency servers. The first two are represented as A and B, the currency servers are denoted as CS. Banks are simply merchants in our protocol and are also represented by A and B. X stands for any participant. <p> Because independent currency servers exist NetCash is more scalable than other e-cash proposals. When coins are exchanged with remote currency servers, the balances of the currency servers (the backing of the currency) are adjusted through the scalable, but non-anonymous, accounting infrastructure proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. The anonymity of the client is not jeopardized because only the currency servers themselves are identified in the non-anonymous transaction. The anonymity provided by NetCash is weaker than the unconditional anonymity provided by Chaum.

Some of these requirements are also described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Security: Forging paper currency is difficult. Unfortunately, electronic currency is just data and is easily copied. Copying or double spending of currency should be prevented or detected.
