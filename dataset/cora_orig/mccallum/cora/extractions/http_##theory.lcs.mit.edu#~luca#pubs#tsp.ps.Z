Abstract: We prove that the Traveling Salesperson Problem (MIN TSP) and the Minimum Steiner Tree Problem (MIN ST) are Max SNP-hard (and thus NP-hard to approximate within some constant r &gt; 1) even if all cities (respectively, points) lie in the geometric space R n (n is the number of cities/points) and distances are computed with respect to the l 1 (rectilinear) metric. The TSP hardness results also hold for any l p metric, including the Euclidean metric, and in R logn . The running time of Arora's approximation scheme for geometric MIN TSP in R d is doubly exponential in d. Our results imply that this dependance is necessary unless NP has sub-exponential algorithms. We also prove, as an intermediate step, the hardness of approximating MIN TSP and MIN ST in Hamming spaces. The reduction for MIN TSP uses error-correcting codes and random sampling; the reduction for MIN ST uses the integrality property of MIN-CUT. The only previous non-approximability results for MIN TSP and MIN ST involved metrics where all distances are 1 or 2.

Reference-contexts: We say that an optimization problem is Max SNP-hard if all Max SNP-problems are L-reducible to it. From <ref> [ALM + 92] </ref> it follows that if a problem A is Max SNP-hard, then a constant * &gt; 0 exists such that (1 + *)-approximating A is NP-hard. <p> PROOF: From [PY93] and <ref> [ALM + 92] </ref> we have the following result: constants B 0 &gt; 0 and r 0 &gt; 1 exist such that, given an instance x of MIN TSP with a (1; 2) B 0 metric and n cities, and given the promise that either opt (x) = n or opt (x)

Reference-contexts: In his PhD thesis, Arora noted that proving the Max SNP-hardness of Euclidean MIN TSP in R 2 should be very difficult, but that this could perhaps be done in R k (n) for sufficiently large k (n) <ref> [Aro94, Chapter 9] </ref>. In [GKP95], Grigni, Koutsopias and Papadimitriou proved that the restriction of the MIN TSP to shortest paths metrics of planar graphs can be approximated within (1 + *) in time n O (1=*) . Such an approximation algorithm is called a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS).

Reference-contexts: Our techniques prove hardness of approximation for other problems mentioned in Arora's paper <ref> [Aro96] </ref> on approximation schemes for geometric problems. We now state and discuss our results for MIN TSP and MIN ST. 1.1. The Traveling Salesperson Problem Interest in the MIN TSP started during the 1930's. <p> This result led Grigni et al. [GKP95] to conjecture that Euclidean MIN TSP has a PTAS in R 2 . They again posed the question of determining the approximability of the problem for higher dimensions. In a very recent breakthrough, Arora <ref> [Aro96] </ref> developed a PTAS for the MIN TSP in R 2 under any ` p metric. Such an algorithm also works in higher dimensional spaces and, in particular, it runs in time n O ((log d2 n)=* d1 ) in R d . <p> Such an algorithm also works in higher dimensional spaces and, in particular, it runs in time n O ((log d2 n)=* d1 ) in R d . Note that the dependence of the running time on d is doubly exponential. In a preliminary version of <ref> [Aro96] </ref> Arora asked if it was possible to develop a PTAS for Euclidean MIN TSP in R n or if, at least, it was possible to have the running time being singly exponential in d, e.g. n O (d=*) . Our Results. <p> The Minimum k-Cities Traveling Salesman Problem (MIN k-TSP) and the Minimum Degree-Restricted Steiner Tree Problem (two problems mentioned in Arora's paper <ref> [Aro96] </ref> on approximation schemes for geometric problems) are generalizations of the MIN TSP. The hardness results that we prove for MIN TSP clearly extend to them. 1.2. <p> However, our results still hold if we instead assume that numbers are rounded and stored in a floating point notation using O (log n) bits. This fact follows from a minor modification of the argument used in <ref> [Aro96] </ref> to reduce a general instance of Euclidean TSP or Steiner Tree into an instance where coordinates are positive integers whose value is O (n 2 ). 3. <p> We have an L-reduction with ff = fi = 1. 2 5. Conclusions and Open questions We do not know how to extend our non-approximability result for MIN ST to the Euclidean case. Arora <ref> [Aro96] </ref> notes that, by inspecting the way his algorithm works, it is possible to claim that, for any instance of Euclidean MIN ST, there exists a near-optimal solution where the Steiner points lie in some well-specified positions (either at portals or in positions chosen at the bottom of the recursion).
