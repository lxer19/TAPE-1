Abstract: In dynamic carrier allocation (DCA) strategies, carriers are assigned priorities. Based upon how priorities are assigned to carriers, DCA strategies are classified into three classes: static-priority, dynamic-priority, and hybrid-priority strategies. In this paper, we lay out a theoretical foundation for DCA strategies: we first develop the concept of optimal reuse pattern and then propose a model for resource planning as well as three guiding principles for priority assignment in static- and hybrid-priority DCA strategies. These theoretical results will shed light on the strength and weakness of existing DCA strategies and lead us to developing more efficient strategies. Specifically, we propose three new DCA strategies: Column-Wise static-priority (CWSP), Column-Wise hybrid-priority (CWHP), and Two-Step dynamic-priority (TSDP). The CWSP and CWHP strategies are obtained from the Geometric strategy by following our guiding principles for priority assignment. The TSDP strategy, on the other hand, was derived from the Nanda-Goodman strategy by applying our notion of optimal reuse patterns. It not only attempts to reuse carriers as compactly as possible (just as other dynamic-priority strategies do), but also goes one step further by bringing the actual carrier reuse pattern closer to the optimal pattern. The performance of the three new DCA strategies are simulated under both uniform and non-uniform traffic distributions. The simulation results show that each one of the three new DCA strategies outperforms existing strategies in its own class, and the TSDP strategy has the best performance among all DCA strategies.

Reference-contexts: This model is the same as that adopted by the GSM pan-European mobile radio network [11], the Nanda-Goodman DCA strategy [12], and the Geometric DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem of carrier allocation is to assign carriers to cells so as to minimize the overall rate of blocked calls, where a call is said to be blocked if there is no channel available for its use. <p> Of the three types of strategies, dynamic strategies seem most promising and have been the focus of recent research <ref> [1, 12, 15] </ref>. Various dynamic carrier allocation (DCA) strategies have been proposed; they differ from each other in the way priorities are assigned to carriers. <p> As priorities can be assigned to carriers in a static, dynamic, or hybrid fashion, DCA strategies are further divided into three classes: static-priority, dynamic-priority, and hybrid-priority DCA strategies. In a static-priority strategy such as the Geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, each carrier in each cell is assigned a fixed priority that does not change over time. In a dynamic-priority strategy such as the Nanda-Goodman [12] and Locally-Optimized strategies [15], a carrier's priority is dynamically computed. <p> Unfortunately, this is not the case in the literature: the locally-optimized dynamic-priority strategy is inferior to the borrowing with directional channel-locking strategy (which is a hybrid-priority scheme) [15]; the static-priority-based Geometric strategy was observed in <ref> [1] </ref> to have a lower failure rate than the dynamic-priority-based Nanda-Goodman strategy. Is dynamic priority inherently not an effective approach? Or efficient dynamic-priority strategies are just yet to be invented? We wish to answer these questions in this paper. <p> Since each cell has six nearest interfering cells, the worst case C=I ratio is given by [C=I] min = [(D min =R) 1] 4 =6, if a fourth-power law attenuation is assumed <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. Although the DCA strategies under study in this paper do not depend on any specific value of D min , we will assume D min = 3 p 3R for ease of presentation. <p> For simplicity, we will use the term priority in places of acquisition-priority whenever it is unambiguous. 3 Previous Work In this section, we briefly review three existing strategies: the Geometric static-priority DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, the borrowing with directional channel-locking hybrid-priority strategy [15], and the Nanda-Goodman dynamic-priority DCA strategy [12]. 3.1 Geometric Strategy In the Geometric strategy [1], the set of all cells is divided into k subsets S 0 ; S 1 ; : : : ; S k1 such that no two cells <p> term priority in places of acquisition-priority whenever it is unambiguous. 3 Previous Work In this section, we briefly review three existing strategies: the Geometric static-priority DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, the borrowing with directional channel-locking hybrid-priority strategy [15], and the Nanda-Goodman dynamic-priority DCA strategy [12]. 3.1 Geometric Strategy In the Geometric strategy [1], the set of all cells is divided into k subsets S 0 ; S 1 ; : : : ; S k1 such that no two cells in the same subset have a distance less than D min , i.e., no two cells interfere with each other. <p> For instance, in the channel borrowing strategies [15], each cell is allocated a set of nominal carriers beforehand; in the Geometric DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, each cell must know its first-choice carriers prior to any carrier acquisition. We call the process of assigning special status to carriers resource planning. Resource Planning 1. <p> However, the biggest disadvantage of static-priority strategies also results from the fixed priorities of the carriers. Since the priorities of the carriers do not reflect the local traffic density and local carrier reuse patterns, the performance of static-priority strategies is handicapped. The Geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, being the first static-priority DCA strategy, has shown its strength in low cost and decent performance. An analysis of the Geometric strategy shows that it follows the first and third principles proposed in the previous section. But the Geometric strategy does not follow the second principle.

Reference-contexts: Three types of strategies have been proposed for carrier allocations: fixed, flexible, and dynamic strategies [14]. Fixed strategies allocate a fixed set of carriers to each cell, which is allowed to use the allocated carriers and no others. With dynamic strategies <ref> [4] </ref>, a cell may use any carrier that will not cause co-channel interference. Carriers are not pre-allocated to cells but, rather, assigned on a dynamic and temporary basis.

Reference-contexts: Typically, each carrier is associated with a priority, and when a cell needs a carrier, it picks the one that is available with the highest priority. The carrier is later returned to the system when it is no longer needed by the cell. Flexible strategies <ref> [13] </ref> combine the aspects of both fixed and dynamic strategies: (1) each cell is allocated a fixed set of permanent carriers and (2) a number of flexible carriers are set aside to be dynamically allocated to cells upon requests.
