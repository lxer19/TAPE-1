Abstract: In Formal Ontology in Conceptual Analysis and Knowledge Representation, edited by Nicola Guarino and Roberto Poli, Kluwer Academic Publishers, in press. Substantial revision of paper presented at the International Workshop on Formal Ontology, March, 1993, Padova, Italy. Available as Technical Report KSL 93-04, Knowledge Systems Laboratory, Stanford University. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence is exploring the use of formal ontologies as a way of specifying contentspecific agreements for the sharing and reuse of knowledge among software entities. We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices and evaluated against the design criteria.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of ontologies focusing on special representation problems, such as varieties of time (Allen, 1984; Ladkin, 1986; Shoham, 1987) , space <ref> (Cohn, 1993) </ref> , part-whole structure (Eschenbach & Heydrich, 1993; Gerstl & Pribbenow, 1993), causality and change (Hobbs, 1993; Terenziani, 1993) . Formal specifications of domain or task specific conceptualizations are beginning to appear in the research literature.

Reference-contexts: Ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions, that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world <ref> (Enderton, 1972) </ref>. To specify a conceptualization one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms. 3 concept might arise from social situations or computational requirements, the definition should be independent of social or computational context. Formalism is a means to this end.

Reference-contexts: For such knowledge-level communication, we need conventions at three levels: representation language format, agent communication protocol, and specification of the content of shared knowledge. Proposals for standard knowledge representation formats (Fulton, 1992; Genesereth & Fikes, 1992; Morik, Causse, & Boswell, 1991) and agent communication languages <ref> (Finin et al., 1992) </ref> are independent of the content of knowledge being exchanged or communicated. For establishing agreements about knowledge, such as shared assumptions and models of the world, ontologies can play a software specification role (Gruber, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Formal specifications of domain or task specific conceptualizations are beginning to appear in the research literature. Ontologies for the sharing and reuse of knowledge about engineering models (Alberts, 1993; Kiriyama, Yamamoto, Tomiyama, & Yoshikawa, 1989), planning and scheduling (Allen & Lehrer, 1992; Hama, Hori, & Nakamura, 1993), manufacturing enterprises <ref> (Fox, 1993) </ref> and problemsolving tasks and methods (Ericksson, Puerta, & Musen, 1993; Musen, 1992; Steels, 1990; Walther, Eriksson, & Musen, 1992) can be viewed as modular building blocks for reusable knowledge bases and ontology-specific software.

Reference-contexts: Ontologies as a specification mechanism A body of formally represented knowledge is based on a conceptualization: the objects, concepts, and other entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and the relationships that hold among them <ref> (Genesereth & Nilsson, 1987) </ref>. A conceptualization is an abstract, simplified view of the world that we wish to represent for some purpose. Every knowledge base, knowledge-based system, or knowledge-level agent is committed to some conceptualization, explicitly or implicitly. An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization.

Reference-contexts: The unit ontologies describe systems 12 of units in which some dimensions are fundamental, with standard units, and the rest are composed using multiplication and exponentiation operators. For example, one such ontology specifies the standard SI system of units <ref> (Halliday & Resnick, 1978) </ref>. Given such an ontology, the agent can determine whether the provided unit definitions are sufficient to compute the magnitude of any quantity given in one unit in terms of another.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge is attributed to agents by observing their actions; an agent knows something if it acts as if it had the information and is acting rationally to achieve its goals. The actions of agentsincluding knowledge base servers and knowledge-based systemscan be seen through a tell and ask functional interface <ref> (Levesque, 1984) </ref> , where a client interacts with an agent by making logical assertions (tell), and posing queries (ask). Pragmatically, a common ontology defines the vocabulary with which queries and assertions are exchanged among agents. Ontological commitments are agreements to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the interest of clarity, definitions should restrict the possible interpretations of terms. Minimizing ontological commitment, however, means specifying a weak theory, admitting many 2 An ontology serves a different purpose than a knowledge base, and therefore a different notion of representational adequacy <ref> (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969) </ref> applies. A shared ontology need only describe a vocabulary for talking about a domain, whereas a knowledge base may include the knowledge needed to solve a problem or answer arbitrary queries about a domain. 4 possible models. These two goals are not in opposition. <p> An extensible ontology may specify a very general theory, but include the representational machinery to define the required specializations. Extendibility and ontological commitment both include a notion of sufficiency or adequacy. Since an ontology serves a different purpose than a knowledge base, the concept of representational adequacy <ref> (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969) </ref> differs. A shared ontology need only describe a vocabulary for talking about a domain, whereas a knowledge base may include the knowledge needed to solve a problem or answer arbitrary queries about a domain.

Reference-contexts: We say that an agent commits to an ontology if its observable actions are consistent with the definitions in the ontology. The idea of ontological commitments is based on the Knowledge-Level perspective <ref> (Newell, 1982) </ref> . The Knowledge Level is a level of description of the knowledge of an agent that is independent of the symbol-level representation used internally by the agent.

Reference-contexts: Since commitment to an ontology does not require completeness of inference, agents can understand the conditions under which a value exists (e.g., a magnitude in some unknown unit) without knowing how to compute the value. This makes it possible to capitalize on the services of mediator agents <ref> (Wiederhold, 1992) </ref> to translate between agents. In this case, the mediator is the unit conversion agent. Summary of Case 1 We have seen how a formal ontology for engineering models can be designed with respect to the general design criteria we outlined in the Section3. Criterion 1 asks for clarity.
