Title: Handoff and System Support for Indirect TCP/IP  
Author: Ajay Bakre and B.R. Badrinath 
Address: Piscataway, NJ 08855.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Rutgers University,  
Abstract: An indirect transport layer protocol such as I-TCP [5] allows using a separate transport protocol for the wireless link between a mobile host and its Mobile Support Router (MSR) without causing interoperability problems with the fixed network. Experiments with I-TCP have shown significant improvement in throughput over regular TCP [5]. Use of indirect protocols requires additional functionality at the MSRs. In this paper we describe the implementation of such functionality for I-TCP. We also present measurements for the time needed for handoffs in case a mobile host with an active connection switches cells.

Reference-contexts: A scheme for installing filters at the MSRs under MH control is described in [30]. In addition, the indirect approach where the intermediary (or a set of intermediaries) exists at higher protocol layers has been investigated by <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Link layer retransmissions can be used on error-prone wireless links to bring their error rate on par with that on the wired networks but such an approach interferes with the end-to-end retransmissions of TCP and thus may not result in improved performance [8].

Reference-contexts: No changes are thus needed to the TCP implementations on the fixed network. Experiments with I-TCP in the presence of host motion have shown improvements ranging from 1.5 to 4 times in the end to end throughput compared to (regular) TCP [5]. Use of indirect protocols <ref> [4] </ref> requires specialized support for indirect connections and handoffs at the mobile hosts and the MSRs. <p> Fast retransmissions coupled with modifications to the TCP software on the mobile hosts [6] solve only part of the problem since most TCP implementations on the fixed network do not support fast retransmissions. I-TCP is based on an indirect protocol model proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> which takes a more general approach towards host mobility and wireless links. 8 Conclusion In this paper we have described the implementation of system support for handing off active transport layer connection state in mobile environments.

Reference-contexts: Using a separate protocol however, raises interoperability problems with the existing stationary hosts. An indirect transport layer protocol such as I-TCP <ref> [5] </ref> allows the use of a separate protocol stack for mobile hosts without causing interoperability problems with the fixed network. I-TCP is built on top of Columbia Mobile IP [10] and provides TCP compatible access to the fixed network from the mobile hosts indirectly through the MSR. <p> No changes are thus needed to the TCP implementations on the fixed network. Experiments with I-TCP in the presence of host motion have shown improvements ranging from 1.5 to 4 times in the end to end throughput compared to (regular) TCP <ref> [5] </ref>. Use of indirect protocols [4] requires specialized support for indirect connections and handoffs at the mobile hosts and the MSRs. <p> Section 7 mentions some of the related research and section 8 contains concluding remarks. 2 Indirect TCP/IP Overview We provide a brief overview of the I-TCP protocol in this section. More details on I-TCP can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. As shown in figure 1, the central idea behind I-TCP is to break an MH to FH (end-to-end) TCP connection into two parts one for the wireless link and the other for the wired network, the MSR serving the MH being the point where the break occurs. <p> MSR failure can cause loss of state information resulting in loss of indirect connections. These drawbacks may be a small price to pay however, considering the performance benefits of using indirect protocols <ref> [5] </ref>. In particular, I-TCP is ideal for throughput intensive applications such as ftp and Mosaic which provide built-in error recovery mechanisms to retry a failed data transfer. Such applications are likely to become popular as mobile clients begin to access information services from the fixed network. <p> Fast handoffs are essential for the throughput improvement that I-TCP affords over regular TCP. Comparative throughput figures for I-TCP and TCP under a variety of wireless cell configurations can be found in <ref> [5] </ref> 4 . The focus of this paper is on the handoff and system support we developed for I-TCP and therefore we will restrict ourselves to analyzing handoff performance. We used the implementation platform described in section 3 for our handoff measurements. <p> The regular socket calls for connect, listen and accept were replaced by their I-TCP equivalents. Throughput experiments conducted using the ttcp benchmark comparing the performance of I-TCP with that of regular TCP have been reported in <ref> [5] </ref>. 2. ftp ftp uses two kinds of TCP connections - one for control and another for data. The control connection is used to exchange application layer control messages between the ftp client and server while a separate data connection is opened for every file transfer.

Reference-contexts: Experiments with TCP have demonstrated poor performance however, if one of the communicating hosts happens to be a mobile wireless computer <ref> [6] </ref>. Host mobility causes temporary disruption in the network layer connectivity resulting in loss of TCP segments. Error prone wireless links used by mobile hosts to communicate with the fixed network also contribute to the increased loss of TCP segments sent to or from mobile hosts. <p> Such applications are likely to become popular as mobile clients begin to access information services from the fixed network. Interactive applications can also benefit from using I-TCP if the MH makes frequent moves, in which case a TCP connection can back off into long pauses <ref> [6] </ref> but an I-TCP connection would attempt a slow start immediately after every handoff. 3 I-TCP Implementation In this section we describe the implementation of I-TCP components at the mobile hosts and at the MSRs that provide the additional functionality needed to support indirect connections and handoffs. <p> Fast retransmissions coupled with modifications to the TCP software on the mobile hosts <ref> [6] </ref> solve only part of the problem since most TCP implementations on the fixed network do not support fast retransmissions.

Reference-contexts: Binding to the MH address and port number also provides a mechanism at the IP layer in the MSR kernel to grab the TCP segments sent by the FH which are destined for the MH address and port number. The I-TCP daemon is a threaded process <ref> [7] </ref> with different modules to communicate with the local MHs, the msrmicp process on the MSR and with the I-TCP daemons on other MSRs. These modules are described below: 1. MH service module This module services I-TCP requests from the MHs local to the MSR.
