Abstract: We present a new approach for the analysis of the left ventricular shape and motion that is based on the development of a new class of volumetric deformable models. We estimate the deformation and complex motion of the left ventricle (LV) in terms of a few parameters that are functions and whose values vary locally across the LV. These parameters capture the radial and longitudinal contraction, the axial twisting, and the long-axis deformation. Using Lagrangian dynamics and the finite element theory, we convert these volumetric primitives into dynamic models that deform due to forces exerted by the datapoints. We present experiments where we used magnetic tagging (MRI-SPAMM) to acquire dat-apoints from the LV during systole. By applying our method to MRI-SPAMM datapoints, we were able to characterize both locally and globally the 3D shape and motion of the LV in a clinically useful way. In addition, based on the model parameters we were able to extract quantitative differences between normal and abnormal hearts and visualize them in a way that is useful to physicians.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique based on magnetic tagging (MRI-SPAMM) has been developed at the University of Pennsylvania for imaging of regional heart wall motion <ref> (Axel and Dougherty, 1989) </ref>. This fast, non-invasive technique promises to be very useful in the analysis of heart wall motion because it provides temporal correspondence of material points within the heart wall. <p> But the technique is still under development. 3.2 Data Based on MRI-SPAMM Even though our LV shape and motion estimation technique can be used with any type of LV data, we will apply it to data from MRI-SPAMM <ref> (Axel and Dougherty, 1989) </ref>, an MR tagging method.

Reference-contexts: Young et al. (1994) developed a method for extracting the intersection points of tagged lines. The method can be summarized as follows. For each image sequence, the tag stripes within the heart muscle are tracked semiautomatically using a 2D active contour model <ref> (Kass et al., 1988) </ref>. In this procedure, each stripe is dis-cretized into equally spaced points and is modeled as a thin, flexible beam with a small inherent resistance to stretching and bending.

Reference-contexts: However, intra-coronary injection of contrast medium is usually required to highlight the blood vessels in acquired images. When the blood supply is severely obstructed due to arterial occlusion, the tracing of the feature points around the region can be very difficult to achieve <ref> (Kim et al., 1985) </ref>. MR tagging has its advantages over the aforementioned approaches because a large number of material points may be marked and tracked during systole in a non-invasive manner.

Reference-contexts: In this way, we can subtract the global rotation from the twisting deformation, and therefore estimate the overall tilting of the LV. The global rotation of our model is expressed as a quaternion. This results in numerically more robust estimation of global rotation during model fitting to the data <ref> (Metaxas, 1992) </ref>.

In our dynamic formulation, we create a model that has no inertia and comes to rest as soon as all the applied forces equilibrate or vanish.

Reference-contexts: In an effort to overcome the limited clinical usefulness of most existing models for analyzing the LV, we have previously developed a new class of deformable 3D surface models whose deformations can be described with a small number of intuitive parameters that are functions <ref> (Park et al., 1994, 1996) </ref>. These parameter functions comprise an intelligent grouping into a small number of sets, of the many local parameters that are necessary to analyze the LV mid-wall. <p> To overcome the above limitations, we have previously developed a new class of surface deformable 2 primitives whose global parameters are functions, and have demonstrated that the LV surface shape and motion can be accurately represented with these parameters that can be easily interpreted by physicians <ref> (Park et al., 1994) </ref>. The input to these models were datapoints sampled from the mid-wall surface of the 3D finite element model of Young and Axel (1992). However, the LV motion cannot be captured entirely with surface models.

Reference-contexts: These forces are associated with the components of q and computed from the 3D force distribution, f , applied to the model based on Z where the Jacobian matrix L is defined in Metaxas and Terzopoulos (1993). For fast interactive response, a first-order Euler method <ref> (Press et al., 1988) </ref> is employed to integrate equation (6). In computing the correct forces from the data the algorithm exploits the geometry of the motion of the SPAMM datapoints over time.

Reference-contexts: The SPAMM technique has been previously used to estimate regional motion patterns during systole (Axel and Dougherty, 1989; Rogers et al., 1991; Young et al., 1994), and the methods for estimating material deformation have been validated using deformable phantoms <ref> (Young et al., 1993) </ref>. The SPAMM data collection technique is based on the application prior to imaging of a saturation pulse sequence where the amplitude of the magnetization varies spatially, in a sinusoidal-like fashion. This saturation pulse sequence forms the tagging planes (see Fig. 2).
