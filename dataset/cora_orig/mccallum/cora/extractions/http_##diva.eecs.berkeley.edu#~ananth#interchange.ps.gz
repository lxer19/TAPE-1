Abstract: We consider the problem of regulating the source traffic in an ATM network to simultaneously satisfy a finite number burstiness constraints, each of which requires that the total amount of traffic over a time interval be bounded by an affine function of the length of the interval. We prove that a series of correspondingly dimensioned "leaky buckets" in tandem achieves such regulation optimally, in that the source traffic is admitted as quickly as possible. A simpler fork-join implementation of this optimal flow control scheme is proposed. Extensions to the problem of shaping the traffic flow to meet a burstiness constraint specified by an arbitrary concave increasing function are also studied. A consequence of our optimality results is that the effect of a series of leaky buckets in tandem on an arbitrary source traffic stream is identical whatever the order in which the leaky buckets are met.

Some of these questions have been anticipated in the <ref> [4] </ref> but in special cases. Our methodology allows for an absolutely arbitrary arrival process which could be continuous, 3 modeling continuous arrivals of "cells" over time, or piecewise constant, representing arrival of "packets" at discrete time epochs, or a mixture of both. <p> The main result is stated as Theorem 3 below: an optimal flow controller is given by a tandem connection of n leaky buckets in series, where the i-th leaky bucket is dimensioned by i0 ; i ; i . This configuration has initially been considered in Cruz <ref> [4] </ref>. The complete proof of its optimality, within the general framework considered in this paper, follows by a series of lemmas concerning some properties of the leaky bucket.

Reference-contexts: Special cases, such as discrete-time flow controllers are modeled by A's which are supported on the integers, and recursive equations for their implementation can be easily found <ref> [6] </ref>. The problem now is to find an optimal flow controller ' satisfying (i), (ii) & (iii) above. We say that ' is optimal iff '(A) t (A) t , for all A 2 M, all t 0, and all flow controllers satisfying the same multiple burstiness constraints. <p> We leave the details out, as they are straightforward. The recursions are based on the fact that the reflection mapping can be dynamically updated. For the form of the recursions with a single constraint, we refer to <ref> [6] </ref>. xIt is interesting to find an expression for the number of cells stored in the flow controller.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, if the offered traffic itself obeys the above constraints the the identity map yielding B = A is a best flow controller. Otherwise, if some constraint is violated, then part of the arriving traffic has to be retained in a buffer. In the absence of additional constraints (see <ref> [7] </ref> for an explanation of the adjective "additional"), every offered arriving unit will eventually be transmitted. The purpose of the flow controller is to do so optimally. <p> The purpose of the flow controller is to do so optimally. The design of an optimal flow controller satisfying a single (; ) constraint is a special case of the results of Konstantopoulos and Anantharam <ref> [7] </ref>. It has been shown that the popular "leaky bucket" scheme achieves the burstiness constraint optimally: no other design can strictly outperform the leaky bucket even if the design had the ability of predicting the future of the source. The results for this special case are reviewed in Section 3. <p> The main part of the paper is Section 4 which provides a rigorous demonstration of the existence (by construction) of an optimal flow controller with multiple burstiness constraints: we use the methodology of our earlier paper <ref> [7] </ref> to show that a series of properly dimensioned leaky buckets is a design that shapes the traffic optimally. We also look into the implementation issues and observe that a series arrangement of leaky buckets is equivalent to a parallel one involving a "fork-join" construction. <p> The operation is known as "reflection mapping" and the optimal flow controller is known as "leaky bucket". The section is thus a brief summary of some of the results of <ref> [7] </ref>. fl If we are only allowed to use a buffer of finite size K, then we have to add the requirement that '(A) t '(A) s K + A t A s , for all t s 0 and all A 2 M; while this restriction is not considered here, <p> If we are only allowed to use a buffer of finite size K, then we have to add the requirement that '(A) t '(A) s K + A t A s , for all t s 0 and all A 2 M; while this restriction is not considered here, see <ref> [7] </ref> for results on optimal flow control with finite buffer constraints. 5 3.1 Reflection mappings We only discuss the case that concerns us here, namely reflection at the single point zero. <p> We next show that a ( 0 ; ; ) leaky bucket is an optimal flow controller when n = 1 for the problem posed in Section 2. Theorem 2 is taken from <ref> [7] </ref>. Theorem 2 The following hold for a ( 0 ; ; ) leaky bucket ': 1. It is causal. 2. It is realizable. 3. It satisfies a single ( 0 ; ; ) constraint. 4. <p> Let us elaborate on this rather important point further. Suppose that we add the requirement that the flow controller cannot store more than K cells (see footnote on page 4). Based on our experience with n = 1 burstiness constraint (see <ref> [7] </ref>) we cannot expect closed-form expressions for an optimal flow controller. However, we do expect that an optimal flow controller is expressible in terms of reflection mappings. <p> However, we do expect that an optimal flow controller is expressible in terms of reflection mappings. For instance, when n = 1, one has to reflect the free process at the boundary of the interval [0; + K] (again, see <ref> [7] </ref> for the complete solution). xFrom a practical point of view, a flow controller satisfying (f 0 ; f ) constraints can be used not only for controlling burstiness, but also for traffic shaping reasons.
