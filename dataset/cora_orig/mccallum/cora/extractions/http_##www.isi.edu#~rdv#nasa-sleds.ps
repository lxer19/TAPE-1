Abstract: Managing the latency of storage systems is a key to creating effective very large scale information systems, such as web interfaces to satellite image databases and video-on-demand servers. Storage Latency Estimation Descriptors (SLEDs) are architecture-independent descriptions of the retrieval time of a unit of data. They describe the latency to the first byte, and the bandwidth expected. SLEDs are an important enabling technology for true end-to-end quality of service (QoS) because they can be used to predict and schedule data transfer with multimedia (guaranteed I/O rate) file systems. SLEDs provide the interface that allows database management systems (DBMS) and clients of hierarchical storage management (HSM) systems to optimize their data access patterns by choosing to read data in specific sequences or not at all. SLEDs are designed to work in intra-machine, local-area network (LAN) and wide-area network (WAN) storage systems, and to scale through twelve orders of magnitude in latency, from thousands of seconds down to nanoseconds.

Reference-contexts: SLEDs are similar, but are more closely tied to the concept of data objects with storage and system state. Hints are used by file systems to order disk accesses and make caching decisions. These hints can be provided explicitly <ref> [24, 1, 8] </ref> or determined by the system based on information such as file name or access history [14]. Hints have also been implemented across a network [26].

Reference-contexts: For applications unable to reorder or reduce their I/O requests, SLEDs will provide only a means for estimating the performance that can be achieved, a useful feature for admissions control in real-time environments and evaluation of potential execution in multimedia file systems <ref> [25, 3] </ref>. As mentioned above, applications such as web browsers may find SLEDs' performance prediction useful, in order to let the user know how long a particular request might take, possibly giving the user the option to cancel requests for which he is unwilling to wait. <p> SLEDs for distributed file systems will require real-time network protocols and techniques such as RSVP to create a complete end-to-end quality of service. This will create, effectively, NFS with the guaranteed I/O rates now provided by multimedia file systems <ref> [25, 3, 29] </ref>. In a distributed environment, clients have less knowledge and control of activity at the server, and unpredictable network traffic can interfere. <p> Free-range I/O may be implemented as a library over top of flat files, in typical Unix fashion, or by directly modifying the underlying storage structures. SLEDs provide the infrastructure to optimize record access ordering in free-range I/O. 7 Related Work Multimedia file systems and video on demand storage servers <ref> [23, 6, 11, 12, 22, 3, 25] </ref> generally provide a mechanism for the application to communicate its needs to the storage system, but provide no feedback in the opposite direction, limiting the level of cooperation.

Smooth integration of SLEDs with RSVP is paramount, but there are some important differences. RSVP is designed to support policing mechanisms and packet-based network jitter control, which are complementary to the problems SLEDs solves but perhaps not necessary in SLEDs themselves.

Reference-contexts: Menon and Treiber have asserted that programmers will be unwilling to optimize their code to improve access patterns and performance in HSM systems, likening the difference between tape and disk to the difference between memory and disk <ref> [19] </ref>. However, the gap between memory and tape is larger, and therefore, more likely to produce significant performance improvements for modest programming effort. 4.3 Distributed File Systems Applying SLEDs to distributed file systems is an interesting problem, due to the cooperation required between client and server.

Reference-contexts: Application-controlled file caching [7] is most like SLEDs, but is tied to the concept of on-disk file systems, with no support for multiple storage hierarchy levels, and no ability to predict performance. Tops-20, NAStore and Cray's Data Migration Facility <ref> [33] </ref> support a single-bit addition to the file system's inode to indicate that files are in archival storage rather than on disk. This aproach can be viewed as very simple SLEDs.
