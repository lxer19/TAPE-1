Abstract: The goal of physical mapping of the genome is to reconstruct a strand of DNA given a collection of overlapping fragments, or clones, from the strand. We present several algorithms to infer how the clones overlap, given data about each clone. We focus on data used to map human chromosomes 21 and Y, in which relatively short substrings, or probes, are extracted from the ends of clones. The substrings are long enough to be unique with high probability. The data we are given is an incidence matrix of clones and probes. In the absence of error, the correct placement can be found easily using a PQ-tree. The data is never free from error, however, and algorithms are differentiated by their performance in the presence of errors. We approach errors from two angles: by detecting and removing them, and by using algorithms which are robust in the presence of errors. We have also developed a strategy to recover noiseless data through an interactive process which detects anomalies in the data and retests questionable entries in the incidence matrix of clones and probes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms empirically, using simulated data as well as real data from human chromosome 21.

Reference-contexts: This suggests the heuristic principle that a permutation of the rows which minimizes the number of gaps will correspond to a good probe ordering. Minimizing the number of gaps can be cast as a Traveling Salesman Problem called the Hamming Distance TSP <ref> [AKNW91] </ref>, in which the cities are the rows of A together with an additional row of n zeroes, and the distance between two cities is the Hamming distance between the corresponding rows; i.e., the number of positions in which the two rows differ.

Reference-contexts: Other than in setting the initial temperature, we use a conventional cooling schedule and a conventional stopping rule [L88] <ref> [AL87] </ref>. The maximum number of moves considered at each temperature step is 20 times the number of STSs. The temperature is multiplied by 0.95 as soon as this number of moves have been attempted, or when 25% of this number have been accepted.

Reference-contexts: This occurrence can be tested either by hybridization or PCR experiments. We present algorithms to determine probe ordering, given data for each clone indicating which probes occur on it. In the absence of errors, the correct orderings can be found very easily using the PQ-tree data structure <ref> [BL76] </ref> to generate the set of all arrangements of probes consistent with the data. The data is never free from error however, and algorithms are differentiated by their performance in the presence of errors.

Reference-contexts: Section 3.1 describes an effective algorithm to find a good solution of this optimization problem. The problem is NP-complete even in the absence of false positives and chimeric clones <ref> [B75] </ref>. 2 Algorithmic Approaches We present several approaches to the problem of recovering the underlying data A and the permu tation from the measured data D. 2.1 The Maximum Posterior Probability Method As discussed above, we attempt to find a matrix A and a permutation which maximize p [A ^ jD].

Reference-contexts: The present paper focuses on the Sequence Tagged Site (STS) mapping strategy, which is widely used for physical mapping within the Human Genome Project and other related molecular biology projects [PSM + 91], [MCG + 93]. In particular the recent mapping of human chromosome 21 <ref> [CRG + 92] </ref> and human chromosome Y [VFH + 92, FVHP92] use this strategy. In the STS approach relatively short substrings called probes are extracted from the DNA strand itself, often from the endpoints of clones. <p> False negative rate fixed at 10% 7 Computational Results In this section we present some computational results for the various algorithms. We present results using data from human chromosome 21 generated by Cohen's group at CEPH <ref> [CRG + 92] </ref> as well as simulated data. <p> In the plots for the Chromosome 21 data, the results of our algorithms are plotted against the order published in <ref> [CRG + 92] </ref>. The quality of an ordering can thus be judged by how close it is to the identity permutation or its reverse. Plots with long line segments of 45 degrees within connected components are more desirable than those with short scattered segments within components.
