Title: Visualised coordination support in distributed decision making  
Author: Peter Svenmarck 
Affiliation: Division of Industrial Ergonomics Linkping Institute of Technology  
Abstract: This paper is concerned with support of the communication of intentions, as this information is important for individuals coordinating locally. A visual communication of intentions was attempted by visualising the behaviour of actors on a dynamic blackboard shown to all. The experiment was inspired by results in social perception, where subjects perceived intentions directly from body movement. The blackboard was implemented in D 3 FIRE, a general paradigm for studying distributed decision making where a group of four subjects are charged with the task of fighting a simulated forest fire, and compared with individuals only communicating by electronic written messages. Contrary to expectations performance decreased with the blackboard. There is, however, a significant decrease in the frequency of communicated intentions since this information was present on the blackboard. Some possible explanations are discussed. First, the design of the blackboard where the location of the units is always visible might explain the reduction in communication of important information about the progress of the fire fighting and this could result in a overconfidence of the control of the fire. Second, only behaviour could be insufficient for visualising the processing involved in fire fighting. More factors such as the wind direction and the location of the fire fighting units in relation to the fire could be required for a unambiguous perception of what the subjects are doing.

Reference-contexts: To perceive self-generated movement and social characteristics in abstract information as these films is a basic ability, or one that is learnt early. Similar to adults, children as young as 4-years described the film in anthropomorphic terms, although the average proportion was less than for adults <ref> (Berry and Springer, 1993) </ref>. Objective This experiment attempted to communicate intentions in distributed decision making by visualising information about movement in a nonlinear system on a dynamic blackboard that was displayed simultaneous to all subjects.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The issue of how to achieve successful coordination among individuals in a complex dynamic system is a pressing concern in many modern tasks, e.g. process industries (Daele, 1993), military systems <ref> (Brehmer, 1988) </ref>, and air traffic control. In these tasks the situation continually changes and it is impossible to make a complete prediction of all situations that might occur. Therefore, overall plans for how and when to act will only be valid at a general level. <p> Further, to cope with the complexity individuals must cooperate. Coordination and adaptation to the demands of the situation are required based on only the individual and partial models of the task <ref> (Brehmer, 1988) </ref>. Models can either be focused on special aspects of the task where information about the system is directly available, or more general, but less detailed aspects. A single model of all aspects can, however, never be formulated due partly to the complexity and partly to the unpredictability.

Reference-contexts: In the blackboard condition information about movements was visualised by small trains of arrows moving at 1 cm/s and 15 Hz refresh rate along a B-Spline path with 3 control points over the four latest positions and the ordered destination <ref> (Prletun, et al., 1989) </ref>. The spline function was adapted to calculate the tangent direction and a constant _ cell width distance between arrows. This visualised information of the movement of all units was displayed simultaneous to all subjects on 5 their terminal.

Reference-contexts: Similar results were obtained in linear collisions where the kinematics specify the weight of the objects relative to each other and the damping caused by material decomposition <ref> (Runeson, 1977) </ref>. These higher order properties are cospecified, since they simultaneously influence the behaviour. However, generally an intention is a very complex mental state and is not specified entirely in only behaviour (Vedler, 1993). Further, there is no empirical evidence of the principles validity for nonlinear systems in general.

Reference-contexts: Some mean of communicating intentions is probably important for a successful local coordination. In the experiment by Brehmer and Svenmarck (1995), intentions were communicated verbally with electronic messages. This form of communication is, however, sensitive to time pressure <ref> (Serfaty, et al., 1994) </ref>, and mental load, and it is therefor important to consider other nonverbal modes of communication. Results by Runeson and Frykholm (1983) indicate such an alternative where only a minimum amount of information about a persons movement was sufficient for direct perception of the persons intention. <p> This is the idea with implicit coordination. When time pressure is high, coordination is more implicit and based on prediction of the others behaviour from knowledge about their situation <ref> (Serfaty, et al., 1994) </ref>. There are some serious difficulties with this form of coordination. To succeed in predicting the behaviour, the subject must know the others model of the task and the situation they currently face, and this is normally very difficult in a dynamic task with limited communication resources.

Finally, studies using animated film techniques have shown the importance of motion as a basis for social perception (Kassin, 1981).
