Reference-contexts: This paper presents a solution to the time-stamping problem in which none of the above are required. For simplicity, the communication model used is that of authenticated broadcast channels. Since such channels can be simulated by a variety of more easily realizable methods (see, for example, [CGMA85], [Fisc83], <ref> [BenO83] </ref>, or [Rabi83]), authenticated broadcast channels serve as a useful communication primitive on which to develop interactive protocols. 1 The model used in this work is somewhat different from that used by Haber and Stornetta.
