Abstract: Combinatorial explosion of inferences has always been one of the classic problems in AI. Resources are limited, and inferences potentially infinite; a reasoner needs to be able to determine which inferences are useful to draw from a given piece of text. But unless one considers the goals of the reasoner, it is very difficult to give a principled definition of what it means for an inference to be "useful." This paper presents a theory of inference control based on the notion of interestingness. We introduce knowledge goals, the goals of a reasoner to acquire some piece of knowledge required for a reasoning task, as the focussing criteria for inference control. We argue that knowledge goals correspond to the interests of the reasoner, and present a theory of interestingness that is functionally motivated by consideration of the needs of the reasoner. Although we use story understanding as the reasoning task, many of the arguments carry over to other cognitive tasks as well.

Reference-contexts: In the second case, the understander might be able to update its world model by identifying gaps in its model. An example of the first type of heuristic is the principle of goal identification used by the POLITICS program <ref> [Carbonell, 1979] </ref>: If the understander of an event identifies with the goals of one of the actors, he will focus attention on inferences that lead to the fulfillment of these goals.

Reference-contexts: In AQUA, interest in a concept is triggered by its likely relevance to questions or knowledge goals, and continuing interest is determined by its continuing significance to these goals. This is related to the "goal satisfaction principle" of <ref> [Hayes-Roth and Lesser, 1976] </ref>, which states that more processing should be given to knowledge sources whose responses are most likely to satisfy processing goals, and to the "relevance principle" of [Sperber and Wilson, 1986], which states that humans pay attention only to information that seems relevant to them.

Reference-contexts: A system with no goals would have no reason to find any input more interesting than any other, nor would any particular piece of information be universally interesting for all systems unless they shared the same goals. This is a functional approach to the problem of interestingness <ref> [Hidi and Baird, 1986; Schank, 1979] </ref> from the perspective of the theory of question-driven understanding.

Reference-contexts: However, memory-level tasks also give rise to heuristics for interestingness which, as before, are based on trying to identify gaps in memory which give the understander an opportunity to learn. For example, the basic learning mechanism in a program such as IPP <ref> [Lebowitz, 1980] </ref> is that of similarity-based generalization, a process that builds categories in memory by noticing similarities between instances or sub-categories and building generalizations based on these similarities.

Reference-contexts: H-3: Vicarious crisis goal An action that initiates a crisis goal of the planner or actor of the action is interesting. An example of a vicarious crisis goal is the self-preservation goal arising from acts of violence. Schank calls violence an "absolute interest" <ref> [Schank, 1979] </ref> since people universally seem to be interested in violence. This follows from the application of heuristic H-3 to the thematic goal of self-preservation which is universal among people. 5.1.4 Actor relevance. <p> A system with no goals would have no reason to find any input more interesting than any other, nor would any particular piece of information be universally interesting for all systems unless they shared the same goals.

Reference-contexts: This is related to the "goal satisfaction principle" of [Hayes-Roth and Lesser, 1976], which states that more processing should be given to knowledge sources whose responses are most likely to satisfy processing goals, and to the "relevance principle" of <ref> [Sperber and Wilson, 1986] </ref>, which states that humans pay attention only to information that seems relevant to them. These principles make sense because cognitive processes are geared to achieving a large cognitive effect for a small effort. <p> These principles make sense because cognitive processes are geared to achieving a large cognitive effect for a small effort. To achieve this, the un-derstander must focus its attention on what seems to it to be the most relevant information available <ref> [Sperber and Wilson, 1986] </ref>. Once the interestingness of a question or piece of input has been determined, AQUA uses it to guide processing by focussing its resources on the more interesting aspects of the story.
