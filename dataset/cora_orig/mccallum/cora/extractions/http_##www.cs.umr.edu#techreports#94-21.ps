Abstract: We consider the solution of Hamiltonian dynamical systems by constructing eighth-order explicit symplectic Runge-Kutta-Nystrom integrators. The application of high-order integrators may be important in areas such as in astronomy. They require large number of function evaluations, which make them computationally expensive and easily susceptible to errors. The integrators developed in this paper require 17 function evaluations as opposed to the 26-stage (effectively 24) eighth-order explicit symplec-tic Runge-Kutta-Nystrom method derived by Calvo and Sanz-Serna. Numerical tests using the 2-Body and the sine-Gordon problems indicate that our methods are comparable to that of Calvo and Sanz-Serna and Yoshida.

Two Nystrom trees are equivalent, as defined in Calvo and Sanz-Serna [3], if they are identical when regarded as unrooted trees. The proposition of Calvo and Sanz-Serna states that if two Nystrom trees are equivalent, then the corresponding to one can be expressed in terms of of the other and 's of trees of lower orders.

Reference-contexts: at least order one, that is, consistent, ff 1 = b T e + B T c = B T e = 1 and the trace of becomes tr ( h) = 2 h 2 + O ( h 4 ): Therefore, as was reported in the paper by Suris <ref> [11] </ref>, a consistent symplectic RKN method is P-stable for sufficiently small time step h.

Reference-contexts: The Hamiltonian function associated with this system is H (q; p) = 2 The demand for higher-order symplectic integrators for (1) is high especially in astronomy, where long-time dynamics are required. Yoshida <ref> [12] </ref> was the first to indicate the existence of symplectic integrators of arbitrary higher order. He proved the possibility of constructing 3 k -stage method having order 2k + 2 using a composition of symplectic 1-stage method of order 2. <p> S8: The 26-stage, 8th-order RKN method constructed from S7 [2]. This method results from the composition of the method S7 with its adjoint. This composition method requires 24 function evaluations each step. Y8: The 16-stage, 8th-order method given in <ref> [12] </ref>. This requires 15 function evaluations each step. For a fair comparison, we use timesteps 2 64 , 2 256 for methods M1, S7 and Y8 and for method S8 timesteps 2 32 , 2 128 .
