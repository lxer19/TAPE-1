Reference-contexts: This may decrease both the routability and performance of the FPGAs. As we can see from the above Fig. 2.2, this architecture will suffer from this pin lock problem because all the interconnections are fixed. 2.3 Splash-2 The Splash-2 <ref> [ABH + 93, Arn95] </ref> is a reconfigurable computer developed by SRC in 1992. The Splash-2 consists of a Sun Sparc station host, an interface board, and from one to sixteen Splash array boards.

Reference-contexts: The Clos network architecture decouples the routing problem from the pin assignment of FPGA. Also, using the small size routing crossbar, it achieves the rearrangeable routing of the interconnection, which makes the FPGA free of the pin locking problem. 2.5 HP Teramac The HP TERAMAC <ref> [ACCea95] </ref> is a reconfigurable computing system capable of running design as large as 1 million gates. A hierarchical design philosophy is adopted in all levels of design from FPGA chip, through MCM, to the board level.

Reference-contexts: The LUT is actually a small piece of memory, where the logic function can be implemented by table lookup. This great flexibility in both the logic and interconnection that the FPGA technology has changed many aspects of the electronic design from system prototyping to computer architecture. Fig. 1.1 <ref> [Alt96] </ref> is a typical FPGA architecture in the market. The Logic Array Block (LAB), is the building block for implementing logic functions. Each LAB is composed of 8 4-LUT (4 input Look-up-tables) and a dedicated carry-chain allowing these 4-LUTs for high speed arithmetic operations. <p> The guideline here is to use a memory which has a higher throughput than the FPGA chip. The estimation of the throughput of the FPGA is hard because it varies upon different applications. However, we can get a worst case delay by analyzing the data given in <ref> [Alt96] </ref>. In Fig. 3.4, an input in Input/Output Element (IOE) is connected to a Flip-Flop in an Logic Element (LE) in a different row. <p> All four FPGAs on the MCM as well the DEBUG FPGA are configured simultaneously using the passive serial mode <ref> [Alt96] </ref>. The MSB of the printer port is used as the clock to clocking the configuration data, which are on the other data bit of the printer port, into the FPGA. Fig. 3.9 shows the definition of each bit of the printer port. <p> In the idle state, it draws little current from the PCI slot. In the booth filter implemented in FPGA, the current is 4A, which is below the maximum 5A limitation of the PCI slot in a PC. In extreme cases, the FLEX10K50 can consume 75W in a single chip <ref> [Alt96] </ref>, however, whether or not these kind of killer applications really exist, or whether there is a way to detect extreme power consumption in an early stage, are very interesting topics for further research.

Reference-contexts: For reconfigurable computing systems, a very high degree of parallelism is utilized by mapping the parallel computing jobs onto the array of the FPGAs. The range of applications investigated by a number of researchers in this area cover image/signal processing [ID94], encryption [Nor95], pattern matching [GJL95], database search <ref> [RKCJ96, CAC + 95] </ref> etc. On the other side, reconfigurability can be used for circuit emulation. In a circuit emulation system, a netlist of the circuit is mapped into the emulator. The reconfigurability of the system offers the user chances to debug the circuit before going to real silicon.

Reference-contexts: Several requirements, such as throughput, controllability, observability, have to be satisfied. Fig. 3.2 is a diagram of the board. The whole system is in a PCI daughter card which is connected to the PCI board <ref> [Cir95] </ref>, where a custom PCI chip is used to translate the PCI interface into a relatively simple 19 protocol. A Pentium based PC is used as the host computer to control the board. The board and host PC are connected via the PCI bus.

Reference-contexts: Although there are crossbar chips in the array board to connect the FPGAs, the FPGAs are not free from the pin locking problem in many applications because the connections are partial due to the interconnection complexity concern. 2.4 BORG The UCSC BORG [CSM92, CS93] is based on the Clos <ref> [Clo53] </ref> network.

After the critical part of the design is located by either software or hardware approach, synthesis techniques such as redundancy addition and removal <ref> [CMSCW94] </ref> can be used to increase the performance. 3.6 Configuration The configuration of the whole system is via the printer port of the PC.

Reference-contexts: MCM technology introduces a new packaging level between printed circuit board and chip, which gives the system smaller area, reduced routing congestion at PCB level, lower power 5 consumption, and faster interconnection. Further-more, if the dice are optimized for MCM using techniques such as area I/O <ref> [DD94] </ref> and smaller buffers, more performance improvement at the system level can be realized. The reasons why FPGA technology can be coined with MCM technology is largely due to yield concerns.

Rent of IBM in 10 1960's. Donath <ref> [Don79] </ref> also got the same results using a stochastic model of hierarchical design process. Rent's rule is stated as follows.

Reference-contexts: We can see that most of the effort are spent on designing a flexible interconnection scheme so that the pin locking problem can be mitigated. 16 Due to the nature of the bit-serial circuit <ref> [Iss96] </ref>, as evidenced by its low Rent's exponent, the routing resources utilization is usually very low, which offered a very good routability. Our system design adopted a different approach other than mentioned above. In the following chapters, the design and implementation of our reconfigurable system will be discussed. 17 3.

Reference-contexts: To justify the tradeoffs made in the design, however, an accurate modeling of the target circuit is necessary. The current approach of the modeling is stochastic modeling based on the Rent's rule <ref> [lR71] </ref>. Rent's rule relates the external communication requirement (number of pins going from the chip to the outside world) and its area. It was first proposed by E. F. Rent of IBM in 10 1960's. Donath [Don79] also got the same results using a stochastic model of hierarchical design process. <p> In real life circuits, the Rent's exponent is found to be between 0:45 ~ 0:75 <ref> [lR71] </ref>. From the designer's point of view, a circuit that has the Rent's exponent suitable for the targeting technology is always desired.

Reference-contexts: In a circuit emulation system, a netlist of the circuit is mapped into the emulator. The reconfigurability of the system offers the user chances to debug the circuit before going to real silicon. There has already been a lot of companies selling these emulation systems, such as Quickturn <ref> [Qui96] </ref>. We can foresee an enormous impact on these configurable systems due to the great leap in gate capacity of FPGAs, from 2K~10K gates a few years ago to 100K+ gate devices soon to come out.

Reference-contexts: Recently some companies have introduced new types of FPGA that are mostly targeted at reconfigurable computing system. Compared with their predecessors, architectures of these new FPGAs such as HP PLASMA <ref> [RAea96] </ref> or Xilinx XC6200 [Xil96], are organized in a hierarchical manner. In HP Plasma, the routing is implemented using a crossbar. The routing resources in the chip are abundant so that the placement and routing can provide very good results even with simplistic greedy algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The crossbar can store 8 different configurations and dynamically switch among these contexts for different connection schemes. 12 The Splash-2 is mainly used as a research vehicle for SIMD, one dimensional array, and several higher order systolic array. Applications, such as genetic sequencing, image convolution <ref> [RJR95] </ref> and line extraction have been implemented. Not only can Splash-2 be used as a custom computing machine, but also it can be used as a computer architecture test vehicle to evaluate the architecture design tradeoffs.

Reference-contexts: The major issue in this design is the assigning of the local and global interconnections such that the partitioner will be able to successfully partition the design 11 into the FPGAs. A series of experiments have been done to tune the partitioner to the architecture <ref> [TdB92] </ref>. However, the fixed connections in this system have created some difficulties in the placement and routing of the FPGAs. For each of the FPGAs, the connections to other FPGAs only exist in certain pin locations.
