Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In <ref> [1] </ref> D. Hilbert showed (using different terminology) that for any k 1, if N is finitely colored than there exists in one color infinitely many transletes of a k-cube. <p> The density version of the Hilbert result is the following: Theorem A: Let k 1 be a integer and assume A <ref> [1; n] </ref> and jAj n 12 k where " 2. Then A contains a k-cube. (see [2],[3]). <p> Then A contains a k-cube. (see [2],[3]). This result implies the following Corollary: Let A be an infinite sequence of integers with d (A) = lim inf A (n)=n &gt; 0; where A (n) = P 1 Then there exists a fi so that for every n, A " <ref> [1; n] </ref> contains a k-cube where k &gt; fi log log n. Proof of the Corollary: Indeed there exists a c &gt; 0 such that for every n, A (n) &gt; cn. <p> Now if ffn 12 k or equivalently if k log log n then by Theorem A, A contains a k-cube as we stated. Definition: Let A be an infinite sequence of integers. Let H (n) = maxfk : A " <ref> [1; n] </ref> contains a k-cubeg So by the corollary we have if d (A)&gt;0 then H (n) log log n. <p> Then 2 + 1 jfAgj 2 k : where fBg = ( k P * i b i : * i = 0 or 1; b i 2 B . The proof is easy or see [4]. Lemma 2: We have T = jfA : A <ref> [1; n] </ref>; jAj = k andj (A)j &lt; k 3 gj &lt; (kn) 5 log 2 k 4 k 2 Proof of Lemma 2: Let U be the event U = fA : A [1; n]; jAj = k andj (A)j &lt; k 3 g. <p> Lemma 2: We have T = jfA : A <ref> [1; n] </ref>; jAj = k andj (A)j &lt; k 3 gj &lt; (kn) 5 log 2 k 4 k 2 Proof of Lemma 2: Let U be the event U = fA : A [1; n]; jAj = k andj (A)j &lt; k 3 g. Clearly P r (U ) = k where P r (U ) is the probability of the event U . Now we are going to give an upper bound for P r (U ). <p> Clearly P r (U ) = k where P r (U ) is the probability of the event U . Now we are going to give an upper bound for P r (U ).

Reference-contexts: Finally we mention a related question of P. Erd-os which solved by E. Straus (see <ref> [5] </ref>): is it true if A is an infinite sequence of integer, A has positive upper density then A contains an infinite Hilbert-cube. The answer is negative.

Reference-contexts: For instance we prove - 2 - if Q is the sequence of squares then H Q &lt; c 0 3 p log n and for the sequence of primes P we get c 1 log log n &lt; H P (n) &lt; c 2 log n (see <ref> [6] </ref>). Finally we mention a related question of P. Erd-os which solved by E. Straus (see [5]): is it true if A is an infinite sequence of integer, A has positive upper density then A contains an infinite Hilbert-cube. The answer is negative.
