Abstract: This class began our discussion of arithmetic in the ring Z=(n). After recalling Fermat's Theorem and stating Euler's Theorem, we analyzed the bit complexities of algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation in Z=(n). More generally, we considered two versions of the efficient exponentiation algorithm that work in arbitrary monoids.
