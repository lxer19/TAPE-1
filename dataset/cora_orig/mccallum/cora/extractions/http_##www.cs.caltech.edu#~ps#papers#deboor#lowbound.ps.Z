Title: ON THE APPROXIMATION POWER OF PRINCIPAL SHIFT-INVARIANT SUBSPACES OF L p (R d  
Author: Michael J. Johnson 
Date: December 23, 1994  
Abstract: For 1 p 1, sufficient conditions on the generators f h g h&gt;0 are given which when satisfied ensure that the h-dilates of the shift-invariant space generated by h provide L p -approximation of order k &gt; 0 or of exponential type ff 2 (0 : : 1] (a notion arising when k = 1). Examples where h is an exponential box spline or certain dilates of the Guassian e jj 2 are considered; it is shown that our sufficient condition then provides an optimal lower bound on their approximation power.

Reference-contexts: the concern of the present paper is to establish lower bounds on the L p -approximation power of PSI spaces, we will leave unmentioned many interesting results which deal primarily with upper bounds on approximation power or with SI spaces generated by more than one function. 2 Strang and Fix <ref> [SF] </ref> have shown that if is a compactly supported L 2 function, then the stationary ladder (S h 2 ()) h provides "controlled" L 2 -approximation order k 2 N if and only if b (0) 6= 0 and one of the following two equivalent conditions holds: 8 f 2 k1 <p> APPROXIMATION POWER OF SHIFT-INVARIANT SPACES 3 the Strang-Fix conditions of order k. These conditions had previously been considered for d = 1 by Schoenberg [Sc]. Clarifications and extensions of <ref> [SF] </ref> can be found in Dahmen and Micchelli [DM2] and Jia [J]. Finally, deBoor and Jia [BJ], using "local" rather than "controlled" approximation, extended the L 2 result of [SF] to L p for all 1 p 1. <p> These conditions had previously been considered for d = 1 by Schoenberg [Sc].

Finally, deBoor and Jia [BJ], using "local" rather than "controlled" approximation, extended the L 2 result of [SF] to L p for all 1 p 1. Later, interest in removing the compact support assumption on the generator developed and was investigated by Jackson [Ja], Buhmann [Bu1], Light and Cheney [LC], Jia and Lei [JL], and Halton and Light [HL]. The following was proved in [JL]. Theorem 1.4. <p> Here the "control" is a combination of that used in <ref> [SF] </ref> and the "localness" used in [BJ]. Note that the compact support assumption of [SF], [DM2], and [BJ] has been replaced by the decay assumption (i) which, incidentally, becomes stronger as the approximation order k increases. <p> Here the "control" is a combination of that used in <ref> [SF] </ref> and the "localness" used in [BJ].

All of the above mentioned papers employ a technique known as Quasi-interpolation/Polynomial Reproduction for their error analysis.
