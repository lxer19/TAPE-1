Abstract: Multi-chip module (MCM) packaging techniques present several new technical challenges, notably substrate testing. We formulate MCM substrate testing as a problem of connectivity verification in trees via k-probes, and present a linear-time algorithm which computes a minimum set of probes achieving complete open fault coverage. Since actual substrate testing also involves scheduling probe operations, we formulate efficient probe scheduling as a special type of metric traveling salesman optimization and give a provably-good heuristic. Empirical results using both random and industry benchmarks demonstrate reductions in testing costs of up to 21% over previous methods. We conclude with generalizations to alternate probe technologies and several open problems.

Reference-contexts: The increased use of multi-chip module packaging for large, high-performance systems has focused attention on several new and challenging CAD problems, especially those related to layout, thermal reliability, and testing [9] [21]. Testing in particular presents one of the most persistent challenges of the MCM approach <ref> [1] </ref> [11] [24]. It is desirable to discover defects in the MCM substrate as early as possible, since the cost of locating and fixing a system fault increases geometrically with each successive stage of the system manufacturing and marketing process.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multi-chip module (MCM) technology has recently emerged as an economically viable means for packaging complex, high-performance systems <ref> [2] </ref> [11] [21] [24]. Traditionally, system performance is limited by interconnection delays at the upper levels of the hierarchy (e.g., printed circuit board or backplane), and may be improved by increasing circuit density and die size. <p> A short fault is defined to be an electrical connection between two nets that are not intended to be connected. Traditional methods for connectivity checking involve either parallel probing of the circuit, or combinatorial exercising of the logic, neither of which apply to MCM substrate testing <ref> [2] </ref>. In verifying connectivity for PCBs, a bed-of-nails tester will simultaneously access every grid point, yielding an efficient, parallel checking procedure. However, this idea cannot be applied to MCMs as feature sizes are too small to allow such a grid-based methodology.

Reference-contexts: For example, when k = 2 the unique path between the two terminals is checked (Figure 3). (A,B) probe tests the shown A-B path for open faults. A 2-probe sequential testing approach developed by Crowell et al. <ref> [7] </ref> for bare-board testing has been adopted by some MCM manufacturers [17]. The method of Crowell et al. uses only one probe for each net in the layout, placing the probe heads on the two pins of the net which are physically farthest apart. <p> Unless the measured resistance deviates significantly from the value predicted for the correct circuit, one assumes that no open fault exists. Similarly, only when capacitance is far from the predicted value will a possible short fault between two nets be investigated more carefully. The algorithm of Crowell et al. <ref> [7] </ref> is efficient in that it uses just one probing operation per net. However, an unfortunate choice of probe locations may yield measured capacitance and resistance very similar to the predicted values, even in the presence of a fault. <p> Indeed, the number of pads in the net induces a lower bound on the number of probe operations needed for fault coverage. The incomplete fault coverage afforded by such methods as <ref> [7] </ref> is economically unacceptable. Thus, MCM manufacturers are now adopting substrate test methodologies which provide complete open fault coverage for all nets [19] [25]. <p> In this method, sufficient capacitance measurements 4 are taken during the open fault checking process to determine whether two nets have been shorted together (i.e., we will encounter a capacitance value that is too high) <ref> [7] </ref> [25]. Thus, the remainder of this discussion is confined to the issue of complete open fault coverage. <p> Once probes are found which adequately test the required classes of open faults, we must schedule the probes for execution by a mechanical tester. Obtaining a good schedule is critical, especially with large production runs. Previous groups <ref> [7] </ref> [25] have used generic greedy or iterative traveling salesman heuristics to attack this problem. We propose two effective heuristics for probe scheduling based on new observations concerning the metricity and allowable structure of the probe set. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. <p> Thus, previous work relies on generic traveling salesman heuristics to optimize the probe schedule. For example, when k = 2 probe heads are available, Crowell et al. <ref> [7] </ref> use a bandsort algorithm to optimize the movement of one of the probe heads. Unfortunately, the other probe head may be forced to travel very large distances between probes, and indeed the resulting schedule is often exceedingly inefficient. <p> Yao et al. [25] use simulated annealing and the Kernighan-Lin 2-opt criterion [16] as the basis of an iterative interchange approach; their schedules save up to 83% of travel costs over the method of <ref> [7] </ref>. All of the heuristics proposed in [7] and [25], however, have unbounded error. In this section, we first show that the k-probe travel costs are actually metric (although clearly not geometric), i.e., distances between k-probes satisfy the triangle inequality for all values of k 1. <p> Yao et al.

Since simulated annealing usually gives solutions quite close to optimal <ref> [12] </ref>, our results confirm that careful choice of compatible probes is an important issue. 5 Future Work Substrate testing for open faults is a critical phase in the production of multi-chip module packages.

Reference-contexts: The Minimal k-Probe Scheduling (k-MPS) Problem: Given a set of k-probes, minimize the total probe moving cost required in executing all probes. A straightforward reduction from the geometric traveling salesman problem <ref> [15] </ref> yields: Theorem 3.1 The k-MPS problem is NP-hard. Proof: We can transform a geometric instance of TSP into an instance of MPS by introducing k copies of each site, then considering each set of k identical copies of a site as a single k-probe. <p> In this section, we first show that the k-probe travel costs are actually metric (although clearly not geometric), i.e., distances between k-probes satisfy the triangle inequality for all values of k 1. As a consequence, traveling salesman heuristics with constant-factor error bound apply <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> It follows that c (A; C) c (A; B) + c (B; C). Theorem 3.2 allows us to apply heuristics which achieve bounded error for metric TSP instances. In particular, Christofides' combination of a minimum spanning tree construction and minimum matching <ref> [15] </ref> yields: 13 Corollary 3.3 Given a set of n k-probes, for any fixed k 1, a heuristic probe schedule with cost at most 3 2 times optimal can be found within O (n 3 ) time. 3.2 Varying the Probe Set A further optimization of the tour schedule is possible

Reference-contexts: Formally, we define a k-probe to be a set of k distinct net terminals which are visited simultaneously by k movable 3 probe heads (typical probe technology uses k = 2, but probe machines with higher values of k are under development <ref> [19] </ref>). A single k-probe simultaneously verifies all k paths between pairs of terminals in the probe set by measuring resistance and capacitance values.

Yao et al. <ref> [25] </ref> use simulated annealing and the Kernighan-Lin 2-opt criterion [16] as the basis of an iterative interchange approach; their schedules save up to 83% of travel costs over the method of [7]. All of the heuristics proposed in [7] and [25], however, have unbounded error. <p> Yao et al. <ref> [25] </ref> use simulated annealing and the Kernighan-Lin 2-opt criterion [16] as the basis of an iterative interchange approach; their schedules save up to 83% of travel costs over the method of [7]. All of the heuristics proposed in [7] and [25], however, have unbounded error. In this section, we first show that the k-probe travel costs are actually metric (although clearly not geometric), i.e., distances between k-probes satisfy the triangle inequality for all values of k 1. As a consequence, traveling salesman heuristics with constant-factor error bound apply [15]. <p> P i+1 , where i was the tour index where P fl had minimum insertion cost 4 Experimental Results We tested our algorithms on an MCM benchmark design obtained from Hughes Aircraft Co., containing 44 components and 199 nets (this is the same benchmark used by Yao et al. in <ref> [25] </ref>). We also used two randomized versions of the Hughes benchmark, where the same net topologies were retained, but with pin coordinates reassigned randomly from a uniform distribution in the layout region. <p> In all cases, a total of 634 probes were generated by our algorithm, the same number as that generated by the algorithm of <ref> [25] </ref>. With each of the PROBE3 experiments, 226 probes were initially chosen to cover the nets which had 15 &gt; 3 pins and which were neither power nor ground; the remaining 408 probes were added incrementally. <p> As expected, the PROBE3 variants, being able to carefully choose probes while constructing the heuristic tour, outperformed PROBE2 by a considerable margin. Results are somewhat better when 3-opt is incorporated, also as expected. For the benchmark design, the best tour obtained in <ref> [25] </ref> using simulated annealing had cost 150,525,000; in comparison, our PROBE3 variants obtain up to 21% improvement over the results of [25]. <p> Results are somewhat better when 3-opt is incorporated, also as expected.

Since simulated annealing usually gives solutions quite close to optimal [12], our results confirm that careful choice of compatible probes is an important issue. 5 Future Work Substrate testing for open faults is a critical phase in the production of multi-chip module packages.

Reference-contexts: With this in mind, Yao et al. [25] have proposed a quadratic-time algorithm that determines a set of 2-probes which will check for all possible open faults (this work was later further developed in [3] [4] [5] [6] <ref> [26] </ref> [27]). In this method, sufficient capacitance measurements 4 are taken during the open fault checking process to determine whether two nets have been shorted together (i.e., we will encounter a capacitance value that is too high) [7] [25].
