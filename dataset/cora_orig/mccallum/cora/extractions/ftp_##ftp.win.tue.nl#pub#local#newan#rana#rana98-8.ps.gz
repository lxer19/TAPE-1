Abstract: Let G be a nilpotent Lie group and H a pure m-th order subcoercive operator constructed from a weighted basis of the Lie algebra g of G. We construct asymptotic approximates G 1 and H 1 of G and H by a scaling limit which ensures that g = g 1 as vector spaces and that G 1 and H 1 are automatically scale invariant. We then compare the asymptotic orbits of the semigroup S generated by H with those of the corresponding semigroup S (1) generated by H 1 . In the simplest case, G = G 1 , we prove that on the spaces L p (G) one has t k p!p = 0 for all p 2 [1; 1]. But if G 6= G 1 then we show that the analogous result fails for all p 2 [1; 1]. Nevertheless, on the spaces L p (g) one has lim

Reference-contexts: Subcoercivity is here defined in terms of a free group of which G is a factor group. Following Nagel, Ricci and Stein <ref> [NRS] </ref> we construct asymptotic approximates G 1 and H 1 of G and H by a scaling limit. The group G 1 and the operator H 1 are automatically homogeneous, i.e., scale invariant. <p> of step r, i.e., it is equal to the quotient G=I where G is the free Lie algebra in d 0 generators, with the i-th generator given the weight w i , and I is the ideal spanned by the multi-commutators of weighted order strictly larger than r. (See also <ref> [NRS] </ref> and [ElR3], Example 2.7.) Let e G be the connected, simply connected, Lie group with Lie algebra ~ g. Throughout the sequel we assume that C is a homogeneous m-th order e G-weighted subcoercive form. <p> Moreover, we assume that the Haar measure on G and G 1 is normalized such that it is the image measure of the Lebesgue measure on g = g 1 under exp and exp 1 , respectively. For a special class of g 1 (a) (see Section 3) Nagel-Ricci-Stein <ref> [NRS] </ref> showed that a 7! (A (1)ff (1) t )(exp 1 a) is the first term in the asymptotic expansion of a 7! (A ff K t )(exp a) in powers of t 1=m . <p> The initial kernel estimates are derived from an asymptotic expansion of K, in terms of the kernel K (1) of S (1) , given by Nagel, Ricci and Stein <ref> [NRS] </ref>. Their procedure is based on comparison of G and G 1 with the larger free group e G. A similar method was used in [ERS] to obtain Gaussian bounds on K and its derivatives in the unweighted case via transference. <p> The relative difficulty of the two cases is analogous to the complexity of analysis of elliptic operators with variable coefficients in contrast to operators with constant coefficients. In Section 2 we introduce the algebraic concepts required and recall various essential results from <ref> [NRS] </ref>. In Section 3 we give the full definition of the operator H 1 and derive the estimates on the associated semigroup kernels. Then in Section 4 we give the detailed proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4. <p> The definition is given in x3 of Nagel, Ricci and Stein <ref> [NRS] </ref>. We repeat their construction and relate these special algebras to the general asymptotic Lie algebras. For the convenience of the reader we give new proofs for some of their results. <p> The two terms are estimated separately. The estimate on the first term establishes the theorem for an ideal asymptotic Lie algebra. Its proof is based on a lemma which can be extracted from <ref> [NRS] </ref>. The bounds on the second term are a consequence of the super-homogeneity of . Let f H = dL e G (C) and let f K be the kernel of the semigroup e S generated by the closure of f H. <p> Proof The result for the kernels, without derivatives, is stated in x1 of <ref> [NRS] </ref> but it is not explicitly proved although its proof is implicit in the discussion of x6. Note that the integrals in the lemma exist by the Gaussian bounds (7). We only prove (8), the proof of (9) is similar. <p> from the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula that there exist c ifffi 2 R such that P (a; b) = a fl b a fl 1 b = i=1 ff; fi kffk v +kfik v &lt;v i c ifffi a ff b fi b i for all a; b 2 g (see also <ref> [NRS] </ref>). Then the Duhamel formula gives Z Z i (1) (1) j d X X kffk v +kfik v &lt;v i c ifffi Z 1 d db da (a) '(b) a ff b fi (D i (1) where D i denotes the partial derivative in the direction b i . <p> For each weighted algebraic basis on a nilpotent Lie algebra one can construct a contraction g 0 of g as t ! 0 and then proceed as before to obtain H 0 , S (0) , K (0) etc. (see <ref> [NRS] </ref> [Heb] [ElR3]).

Reference-contexts: Therefore we have to concentrate on bounds uniform for all t 1. By the proof of Proposition IV.5.6 in <ref> [VSC] </ref> there exists a o 1 1 such that j exp aj 0 o 1 jaj for all a 2 g such that j exp aj 0 1. <p> Therefore the estimates (13) are valid for all t 1 since there is a c 0 &gt; 0 such that V (t) c 0 t D for all t 1 (see <ref> [VSC] </ref>, Theorem IV.5.8). 2 4 Semigroup estimates In the previous section we showed that the kernel K t converges to the kernel K (1) tends to infinity. If g = g 1 (a) this immediately implies that the semigroup S converges uniformly to the corresponding asymptotic semigroup S (1) .
