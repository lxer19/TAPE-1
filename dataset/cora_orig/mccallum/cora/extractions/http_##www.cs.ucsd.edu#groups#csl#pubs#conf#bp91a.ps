Reference-contexts: A probabilistic coalition is a coalition in which the formation decision is based upon the result of a random device that accepts as input the clustering parameter c 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. A probabilistic coalition is similar to an "imperfect coalition" [7] except that the decision to desert is made randomly.

Reference-contexts: At any clustering value, there is some action pair that is in equilibrium, but no single equilibrium exists for all values of the clustering parameter. (We also call each of these equilibria stable because they are adjacent to each other.) This suggests that a hill-climbing technique <ref> [3] </ref> which loses equilibrium due to a change in the clustering parameter must find another hill to climb. Fig. 7 shows weakly stable games where there are no equilibria for certain values of the clustering parameter.

Reference-contexts: Although all non-zero-sum games have an equilibrium in, at least, mixed strategies [8], we only plot equilibria in pure strategies. The analytic treatment makes no prediction concerning the behavior of players under the condition that a pure strategy equilibrium does not exist. A hill-climbing technique <ref> [5] </ref> might try all action pairs in vain at certain values of the clustering parameter, a gross approximation of a mixed strategy. We also call the equilibria that have an edge along the gap weakly stable.

Reference-contexts: The matrix signifies that a group has action dependency and the vector signifies that agents working alone have action independency. (Note the singleton vector for payoffs to an isolated player is more general than the fixed payoff of 1 in a prisoner's dilemma <ref> [6] </ref>). A probabilistic coalition is a coalition in which the formation decision is based upon the result of a random device that accepts as input the clustering parameter c 2 [0; 1].

Reference-contexts: VI. Taxonomy of Coalition Games Two-player games have been normalized into 78 standard games <ref> [9] </ref> according to stability: no conflict, strongly stable, strongly stable deficient, stable, threat-vulnerable, force-vulnerable, unstable, multiple and none. <p> A choice of max = 4 suggests that the players can perform at the best case level of the 2-player game. Figs. 5 to 8 illustrate six of the standard 2 x 2 games from <ref> [9] </ref>, each with singletons included for max = 1 and max = 4. The number of each game corresponds to the original labeling by [9]. Regardless of the choice of max = 1 or max = 4, both yield the same categorization of each of the 312 games. <p> Figs. 5 to 8 illustrate six of the standard 2 x 2 games from <ref> [9] </ref>, each with singletons included for max = 1 and max = 4.
