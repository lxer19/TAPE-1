Title: Psd a Portable Scheme Debugger*

Abstract: Psd is a portable debugger for the Scheme language. Debugging with Psd is accomplished by instrumenting the original source program. When the instrumented program is run, it presents the user with an interactive interface that lets him or her examine and change values of variables, set breakpoints, and single step evaluation. Psd is designed to be run within GNU Emacs, which is used for displaying the current source code position.

Reference-contexts: The edebug package for GNU Emacs Lisp [2], written by Daniel LaLiberte, uses the the same ideas, but is much more tightly integrated with GNU Emacs. Jurgen Heymann has implemented an instrumenting debugger for the Simscript II.5 simulation language <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 The Emacs Interface Psd uses GNU Emacs as its user interface. The primary use for Emacs is to provide source code debugging. A typical Psd session is shown in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: When a procedure in the program is invoked, it behaves as if it was executed under a conventional debugger. 2 Related Work There are a few other debugger that are implemented similarily. The edebug package for GNU Emacs Lisp <ref> [2] </ref>, written by Daniel LaLiberte, uses the the same ideas, but is much more tightly integrated with GNU Emacs.

Reference-contexts: While some of them have extensive debugging capabilities, many small implementations have only limited support for it. Psd provides source level debugging as an "add on", relying only on features described in the Revised 4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme <ref> [3] </ref>. Psd does not use the macro proposal of the report, so it should work with Revised 3 Scheme implementations, also.
