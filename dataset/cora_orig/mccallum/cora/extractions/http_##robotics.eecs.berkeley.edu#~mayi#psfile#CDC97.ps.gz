Abstract: Visual servoing, i.e. the use of the vision sensor in feedback control, has been of increasing interest. Work has been done by applications in autonomous driving, manipulation, mobile robot navigation and surveillance. This paper studies the navigation task for a nonholonomic ground mobile base tracking an arbitrarily shaped ground curve using vision sensors. This tracking problem is formulated as one of controlling the shape of the curve in the image plane. The study of the controllability of the system characterizing the image curve dynamics shows that the shape of the image curve is controllable only up to its "linear" curvature parameters. A stabilizing control law is presented for tracking (piecewise) analytic curves, and we propose to track arbitrary curves by approximating them by piecewise linear curvature curves. Simulation results are given for these control schemes. The observabil-ity of the image curve dynamics using direct measurements from vision sensors as the outputs is studied and an extended Kalman filter is proposed to dynamically estimate the image parameters needed for the feedback control from the actual noisy image sequences.

One can refer Ma <ref> [8] </ref> for generalized results to other mobile robot models. <p> This is directly proved through mathematical induction on n. For details see Ma <ref> [8] </ref>. This lemma implies that, under certain conditions, the dynamics of the orthographic projection image curve and that of the perspective projection image curve are algebraically equiv alent. <p> Lemma 2 For a linear curvature curve, any ~ i ; i 4 can be expressed as a function of only ~ 1 ; ~ 2 , and ~ 3 . Especially, ~ 4 is given as: ~ 4 = c (a 2 +~ 2 3 2 See Ma <ref> [8] </ref> for a detailed proof. <p> According to Chow's Theorem [10], the reachable space of system (10) is of dimension 3 when c 6= 0, and 2 when c = 0, i.e. for linear or constant curvature curves, the shape of the image curves are controllable. For general curves, one can actually show (see Ma <ref> [8] </ref>) that the shape of the image curve is only controllable up to its linear curvature parameters, i.e. ~ 1 ; ~ 2 and ~ 3 : Theorem 2 (General Curve Controllability) The locally reachable space of ~ under the motion of an ar bitrary ground-based mobile robot has at most <p> Once on M , the mobile robot has the given linear velocity v 0 and the perfect tracking angular velocity ! 0 = ~ 3 sin 2 v 0 . For the proof of this theorem see Ma <ref> [8] </ref>. Although Theorem 3 only guarantees local stability, it can be shown by simulation that, with appropriately choosen K v and K ! , the tracking control law (19) has a very large domain of attraction. <p> For more details and illustrative examples see Ma <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.2 Simulation Results of Tracking a Linear Curvature Curve For the simulation shown in Figure 4, we choose the camera tilt angle = =3, and the control parameters K ! = 1; K v = 0:5, and v 0 = 1. <p> We here use the widely used extended Kalman filter (EKF) [9] to estimate the states p. 5 of such systems. In order to make the EKF converge faster, we need to use multiple measurements instead of using only one.

Reference-contexts: Using the algorithm given by Murray and Sastry <ref> [11, 10] </ref>, it can be transformed to the canonical chained-form. <p> Then, the transformed system has the chained-form: 8 : _x 2 = u 2 (16) For chained-form systems, using piecewise smooth sinusoidal inputs <ref> [11] </ref>, one can arbitrarily steer the sys tem from one point to another. Therefore, one can arbitrarily control the shape of the image of a linear curvature curve. However, when c = 0, i.e. the curve is of constant curvature, the above transformation is not well-defined.
