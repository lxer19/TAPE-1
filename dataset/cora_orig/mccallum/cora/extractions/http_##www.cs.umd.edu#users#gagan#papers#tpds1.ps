Abstract: Data is often replicated in distributed systems to improve availability and performance. This replication is expensive in terms of disk storage since the existing schemes generally require full files to be stored at each site. In this paper, we present schemes which significantly reduce the storage requirements in replication based systems. These schemes use the coding method suggested by Rabin to store replicated data. The first scheme that we present is a modification of the simple voting algorithm and its quorum requirements. We then show how some of the extensions of the voting algorithm can also be modified to get storage efficient schemes for managing such replication. We evaluate the availability offered by these schemes and show that the storage space required to achieve certain availability are significantly lower than the conventional schemes with full file replication. Since coding is used, these schemes also provide a high degree of data security.
