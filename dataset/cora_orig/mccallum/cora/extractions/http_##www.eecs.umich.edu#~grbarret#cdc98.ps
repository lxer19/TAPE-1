Abstract: The decentralized control problem addressed in this paper is that of several communicating supervisory controllers, each with different information, working in concert to exactly achieve a given legal sublanguage of the uncontrolled system's language model. A general model is reviewed for dealing with this class of problems. Existence, non-uniqueness, and some synthesis results to the above-mentioned problem are given.

In this section, we review the model presented in <ref> [9] </ref> that is useful for capturing the interaction between these three roles.
