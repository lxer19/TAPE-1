Title: AT 2 Bounds for a Class of VLSI Problems and String Matching  
Author: Micah Adler John Byers 
Abstract: We present a class of boolean functions which have regional mappings, a generalization of the transitivity property defined in [12]. We prove that all transitive problems have regional mappings, as do a variety of interesting computational problems such as merging two sorted lists of arbitrary length, generalized integer multiplication and matrix-vector products. We present a general area-time lower bound for VLSI implementations of problems with regional mappings and confirm that the lower bound matches the previously known bound for transitive problems. For generalized integer multiplication, we present a custom VLSI implementation which provides a matching upper bound. The results improve AT 2 bounds on a number of open problems. In related work, we consider the problem of finding occurrences of a P -bit pattern in an N -bit text string. We show that every chip capable of solving this string matching problem requires AT 2 = (P N ). A custom VLSI design, using an idea similar to that used for generalized integer multiplication, provides a matching upper bound when N is polynomial in P .

Therefore, AT 2 = O (V P ) when V is polynomial in P . 4.2 Merging Two Sorted Arrays Baudet and Chen <ref> [1] </ref> prove a lower bound for merging two sorted arrays of lengths k and s, k s, of AT 2 = (s 2 log 2 s). When k is much larger than s, this bound is not tight, and they state as an open problem obtaining a better lower bound.

We employ the methodology used by Vuillemin, seeking to characterize a wide range of problems whose area-time complexity can be lower bounded by a general technique. <p> The proof of the area-time lower bound is derived from the tesselation technique of Bilardi and Preparata <ref> [2] </ref>, which proves that a large number of bits must be transmitted across the boundary of a small rectangle of the VLSI chip for problems having regional mappings. <p> In Section 2, we review the VLSI model proposed by Thompson [10]. In Section 3, we define the class of problems which have regional mappings and provide a lower bound on those problems using the tesselation lower bound technique of Bilardi and Preparata <ref> [2] </ref>. We then provide the definition of transitive problems and give a proof that the class of transitive problems is a subset of the class of problems having regional mappings. Section 4 examines two problems, generalized integer multiplication and variable-length merging; regional mappings produce improved lower bounds for these problems. <p> In this model, it is assumed that the chip is when and where-oblivious, i.e. I/O bits conform to a fixed schedule, arriving and departing at a fixed time and location for all problem instances. Using terminology introduced in <ref> [2] </ref>, the I/O schedule is semellective and unilocal, i.e. each input bit is received at exactly one time and location. <p> Since jIj = n 3 , we 1 This proof technique also draws from ideas presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. will have a total of jGj n 3 edges between I and all outputs. But, in any transitive group of permutations, the number of elements such that g (u) = v; g 2 G is the same for all u and v.
