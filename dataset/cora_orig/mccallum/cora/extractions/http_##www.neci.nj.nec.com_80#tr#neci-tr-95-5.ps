Abstract: This paper describes a method for performing image content query, and describes experiments with this method. The basic idea is to match images with a given pattern using two discriminants, one that measures the difference of intensities and the other that measures the Euclidean distance between the pattern and image. The approach was described earlier by Stone and Li, and is enhanced in this paper to reduce the effects of occlusions. The end goal of the research is to perform matching on compressed forms of images, and to move towards that goal, the discriminants are computed in the freqency domain. In that domain, images can be compressed by setting small coefficients to zero, thus reducing the cost of calculating the discriminants. We show that the majority of the operations can be done in the frequency domain with only the nonlinear thresholding operations performed in the pixel domain. The major cost of the computation is in the inverse Fourier transforms required to produce the pixel-domain representations of the discriminant functions. The experiments show that occlusion reduction is very effective, and that it increases the computational effort by about 50 percent. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the search on queries of a satellite image library for patterns that are similar in both intensity and texture in the various images in which they appear. These two discriminants are not sufficiently powerful by themselves to identify patterns of shapes and edges in which the shapes and edges can appear in a variety of different intensities.
