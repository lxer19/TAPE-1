Abstract: up reasonable probability estimates such that the con-ditional probability that John was both hunting and shopping is higher than that of John robbing the store (given the propositions stated in the text). However, selecting an interpretation based solely on the probability of propositions about the situation being described is ignoring the fact that these propositions are adjacent sentences in a natural language text, not just random facts observed in the world. As illustrated by this example, text coherence dominates and results in the reader selecting the more coherent interpretation that John was robbing the store. We plan to investigate the efficiency gain which may be brought about by incorporating an ATMS (Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System) into the abductive inference procedure, so as to efficiently keep track of the dependency among the assumptions and propositions of various competing explanations. Since uncertainty and likelihood information is needed in order to achieve a complete understanding of natural language text, and because a straightforward application of Bayesian probability theory does not give a completely satisfactory solution (as we have illustrated here), an approach that will integrate both the importance of text coherence and likelihood information is an important issue in future research. In summary, we have described some problems encountered using abduction to understand text, and have presented some solutions to overcome these problems. The solutions we propose center around the use of explanatory coherence to evaluate the quality of explanations, to determine the appropriate level of specificity of explanations, and to guide the heuristic search to efficiently compute explanations of sufficiently high quality. These solutions have proven to be very effective on a range of examples in text understanding. [Bylander et al., 1989] Tom Bylander, Dean Alle-mang, Michael C. Tanner, and John R. Josephson.
