Abstract: We present practical algorithms for constructing partitions of graphs into a fixed number of vertex-disjoint subgraphs that satisfy particular degree constraints. We use this in particular to find k-cuts of graphs of maximum degree that cut at least a k1 k (1 + 1 2+k1 ) fraction of the edges, improving previous bounds known. The partitions also apply to constraint networks, for which we give a tight analysis of natural local search heuristics for the maximum constraint satisfaction problem. These partitions also imply efficient approximations for several problems on weighted bounded-degree graphs. In particular, we improve the best performance ratio for the weighted independent set problem to 3

Reference-contexts: Corollary 12 The weighted vertex cover problem can be approximated within 2 3 +2 in time O (n 3=2 ). 5.1 Coloring Lovasz's lemma also has implications for the coloring of bounded-degree graphs, as observed previously by Catlin [3], Borodin and Kostochka <ref> [2] </ref> and Lawrence [17]. The constructive nature of the lemma has apparently not been made explicit before. Our implementation yields an efficient coloring algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The optimal solution of the whole graph can contain at most as many vertices from each subgraph as the optimal solution on that subgraph. Hence, the optimal solution is at most s times as large as the approximate solution. One such problem is Max Compatible Constraint Satisfaction <ref> [4, MS11] </ref>, This is problem on a CSP instance, where the objective is to find an assignment to a subset of the vertices that satisfies all the induced constraints. Corollary 10 Max Compatible Constraint Satisfaction can be approximated within a relative ratio of 1=d +1 3 e in linear time.
