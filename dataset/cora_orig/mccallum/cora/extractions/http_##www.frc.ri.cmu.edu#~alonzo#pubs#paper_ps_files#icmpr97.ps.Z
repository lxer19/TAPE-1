Abstract: Off-road autonomous navigation is one of the most difficult automation challenges from the point of view of constraints on mobility, speed of motion, lack of environmental structure, density of hazards, and typical lack of prior information. This paper describes an autonomous navigation software system for outdoor vehicles which includes perception, mapping, obstacle detection and avoidance, and goal seeking. It has been used on several vehicle testbeds including autonomous HMMWVs and planetary rover prototypes. To date, it has achieved speeds of 15 km/hr and excursions of 15 km. We introduce algorithms for optimal processing and computational stabilization of range imagery for terrain mapping purposes. We formulate the problem of trajectory generation as one of predictive control searching trajectories in command space. We also formulate the problem of goal arbitration in local autonomous mobility as an optimal control problem. We emphasize the modeling of vehicles in state space form. The resulting high fidelity models stabilize coordinated control of a high speed vehicle for both obstacle avoidance and goal seeking purposes.

Reference-contexts: Give one behavior priority over the other. Regardless of how this is done, the general technique involved is arbitration. Several approaches have been used ranging from subsumption of one behavior in favor of another <ref> [8] </ref> to consensus-building and voting techniques [47]. A spectrum of approaches exist with extremes that correspond roughly to bureaucracy and democracy. Our approach is somewhat intermediate between these extremes. It recognizes that: Some behaviors, like obstacle avoidance, must be given absolute veto power over unsafe trajectories.

Reference-contexts: agree is one measure of the fidelity of control that has been achieved. 5.2.1.4 Duality of States and Events It will be useful to distinguish two approaches to dynamic system modeling that are analogous to the duality between actions and states that has been well discussed in the AI literature <ref> [25] </ref>. In a state based representation, system motion is viewed as a series of states that are altered by events. In an event based representation, the state of the system is derived implicitly from its initial state and all events that have occurred up to a particular point.

Reference-contexts: enough resolution sensors and computations to enable it to detect the smallest event or feature that can present a hazard. guaranteed localization: It must incorporate sufficiently high fidelity models of itself and the environment to enable it to make correct decisions and execute them sufficiently accurately. 2.2.3 Subproblems Analysis shows <ref> [31] </ref> that traditional configuration space planning techniques applied to cross-country navigation suffer from problems of poor reliability and stability, and poor computational efficiency. Indeed, our experience has demonstrated regular collisions with obstacles that were seen and reacted to. <p> We will call this predicament the perceptual throughput problem. Perceptual throughput can be expressed in units of range or intensity pixels measured per second, or its equivalent. We address here this typical performance limitation of autonomous outdoor vehicles. Analysis suggests <ref> [31] </ref> that much of the computational resources used to image and interpret the environment can be a waste of resources in mobility scenarios. This waste occurs for three principle reasons: The vertical field of view is often too wide from a throughput perspective.

Reference-contexts: Further, consideration of these unrealistic trajectories in search tended to waste computational resources, thereby increasing reaction time and aggravating the first problem of computational inefficiency. After conducting a study of some related real-time issues <ref> [32] </ref>, we concluded that classical C-space planning techniques were ineffective in our domain. A new approach was necessary. 5.1.2 Solution Motion planning is a problem involving search. Recall that heuristic search efficiency can be improved by appropriate ordering of constraints because some have more power to limit search than others.

Reference-contexts: Software adaptation provides the best of both worlds because it gives the ideally focussed attention necessary for high speed and the wide field of view necessary for rough terrain. In our earlier paper <ref> [34] </ref>, we have showed that required perceptual throughput is polynomial in the reaction distance. This analysis suggests that certain approaches to mapping the environment in mobility scenarios can waste significant computational resources.

Reference-contexts: Regardless of many other design variables, all or part of the local environment is typically searched. 5.1.1 Problem Our initial attempts to search trajectories were founded on classical C-space techniques <ref> [40] </ref>. These attempts were very slow, brittle, and inelegant, but they were educational. In our early work, we encountered the following major problems: computational inefficiency: There was not enough time to decide what to do. <p> While the choice of one representation over another does not affect the capability for expression, it does affect the relative ease with which certain properties are represented and reasoned about. 5.2.1.5 C-Space Methods Robot planning has commonly used an abstraction known as configuration space (C-space) <ref> [40] </ref> - a space spanned by any set of parameters that uniquely describe the configuration of the robot. Relatively speaking, the determination of trajectory admissibility (safety) is fairly trivial in C space but significant work is required to ensure feasibility.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that spurious matches occur fundamentally because regions which do not correspond physically actually look more or less the same. Several solutions to this repetitive texture problem help the situation somewhat but the simple technique of computing connected components and removing small regions <ref> [43] </ref> works effectively and is computationally free because a disparity image cleanup pass is required even when a wide disparity range is searched.
