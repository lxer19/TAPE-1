Abstract: The concept of a W-matrix is used to give an elementary interpretation of a biorthogonal wavelet decomposition of signals. We also give a method to modify the decomposition to give an orthogonal projection on the the space spanned by the scaling vectors. Roughly speaking, our treatment is a finite-length analog of the well-known theory of multiresolution analysis of Meyer and Mallat. Our approach differs in that it deals directly with the discrete case, it takes care of the boundary elements without explicit padding, and it uses a notion similar to that of semi-orthogonality introduced by Chui. Our algorithm has flexibility in the choice of filter coefficients. The decomposition, orthogonalization, and restoration algorithms are computationally fast. The theory of wavelets has had a great impact on the technology of image processing. Excellent expositions of the classical theory can be found in [1] and [2] and the references quoted in them. The idea of W-matrices was introduced in [3] and has been used to give an elementary interpreation of wavelet decomposition. The concept had also led to some new perspectives on how discrete signal can be treated. Implementation of four-tap W-transforms was described in [4]. In this paper, we survey this approach and describe a method to modify the decomposition to give an orthogonal projection on the the space spanned by the scaling vectors. We use the special case of four-tap filters for the majority of our discussion; most of the ideas can be extended to the general case. We start with any vector of four numbers such that h 1 h 4 h 2 h 3 6= 0. Although the theory imposes no further restrictions, in practice, these numbers are usually chosen to form a four-tap high-pass filter. As a concrete example, we use [1; 3; 3; 1]. Choose two other numbers c 6= d, and form the vector Each pair is shifted by two positions to the right relative to its previous pair, and blank positions are filled with zeros. We add the first and last columns to their neighbors, respectively, to form a matrix of order 2n fi 2n : h = [h 1 ; h 2 ; h 3 ; h 4 ]; (1)
