Abstract: In recent years, researchers have been dedicated to the study of underactuated manipulators which have more joints than control actuators. In previous works, assumptions were made as to the existence of enough dynamic coupling between the active and the passive joints of the manipulator for it to be possible to control the position of the passive joints via the dynamic coupling. In this work, the authors aim to develop an index to measure the dynamic coupling, so as to address when control of the underactuated system is possible, and how the motion and robot configuration can be designed. We discuss extensively the nature of the dynamic coupling and of the proposed coupling index, and their applications in the analysis and design of underactuated systems, and in control and planning of robot motion configuration.

Reference-contexts: Recent works presented control strategies to deal with the joint and Cartesian control problem of underactuated manipulators. Arai and Tachi <ref> [1] </ref> presented a method which required brakes to be installed on each passive joint. The basic idea was to use the dynamic coupling between the active and the passive joints to drive the passive joints to a desired set-point. <p> We can conclude that it is necessary to have at least p actuators in the underactuated mechanism to be possible to control all p passive joints independently. Note that this result was already established by Arai and Tachi <ref> [1] </ref>; however in their work, this conclusion was reached only after a study of the linearized dynamic equations of the system. q p pp b += p q p M c Ax b= r p&gt; M c rank M c r p&lt; c p r Case 2: In this case we

Reference-contexts: It must be noted that M as defined in (2) is not always equal to the conventional inertia matrix of mechanical manipulators. Nonetheless, M still preserves important properties of the original inertia matrix, such as symmetry and positive-definiteness <ref> [2] </ref>. The submatrix M pp , being a square diagonally-positioned submatrix of a symmetric positive-definite matrix, can be proved to be positive-definite.

Reference-contexts: Arai and Tachi [1] presented a method which required brakes to be installed on each passive joint. The basic idea was to use the dynamic coupling between the active and the passive joints to drive the passive joints to a desired set-point. Later, Bergerman and Xu <ref> [3] </ref> enhanced this method to deal with parameter uncertainty and provide the system with a greater deal of robustness.

Reference-contexts: Let n be the total number of joints, r the number of active joints, and the number of passive ones. By using the Lagrangian formulation <ref> [4] </ref>, one can obtain the following set of differential equations relating the accelerations of the joints to the torques supplied by the actuators: (1) Here, the matrix M 0 is the n x n inertia matrix of the manipulator, b 0 is a vector containing all the centrifugal, Coriolis and gravitational

Reference-contexts: In this case, a global coupling index is more useful, for it will measure the coupling between the joints at all points in the joint space. One possible way of defining a global coupling index is as follows <ref> [5] </ref>: (16) where the integrals above are taken over the entire joint space of the manipulator.

Reference-contexts: In the general case, infinite solutions can be found. One can choose among these solutions the one that provides the minimum norm of , so as to save energy, or effectively make use of this redundancy to accomplish tasks such as obstacle avoidance, coupling maximization, actuability maximization <ref> [7] </ref>, etc. In any of the cases above, it is useful to define a measure of the dynamic coupling at any given instant.

Following Lee and Xu [7] and Xu and Shum [12], it is natural to think of the singular values of , which quantify its degree of invertibility and thus its capacity to transmit the torque from the active to the passive joints.

The actuability index measures the arbitrariness of the actuators ability to cause acceleration at the end-effector. <p> The actuability index indicates how much acceleration can be obtained at the end-effector given limited torques at the active joints. It does not attempt to quantify the accelerations at the passive joints. We refer the reader to Lee and Xus work <ref> [7] </ref> for more detailed information on the actuability index. 4.2 Individual Joint Coupling In the same way we defined the coupling index, one can think of an individual joint coupling index relating each passive joint to each active one.

Reference-contexts: In cases for which the number of actuators is greater than the number of passive joints, such a measure can also be used in connection with a redundant control scheme <ref> [9] </ref>, in order to maintain the system as far as possible from the positions that yield low dynamic coupling. 2 Dynamic Coupling In order to derive the measure of dynamic coupling between the accelerations of the passive and active joints of an underactuated manipulator, we must first present the dynamic equations

Reference-contexts: Because of the impossibility of integrating, in the general case, the nonholonomic constraints imposed by the passive joints (as demonstrated by Oriolo and Nakamura <ref> [10] </ref>), we focus on the acceleration relationship between the active and the passive joints, rewriting equation (3) as: (4) where p n r= 0 0 0 0 0 0 + t = p aa ap pa pp a p a p t 0 r p p pp M q M 1

Reference-contexts: Parameter uncertainty can lead the system to poor or even unstable performance. Another control strategy requiring the use of brakes was developed by Papadopoulos and Dubowsky <ref> [11] </ref> for a space manipulator. In every work mentioned above, the authors had to assume that sufficient coupling existed between the passive and the active joints, so that the controller could transmit the forces/torques to the passive joints in order to drive them.
