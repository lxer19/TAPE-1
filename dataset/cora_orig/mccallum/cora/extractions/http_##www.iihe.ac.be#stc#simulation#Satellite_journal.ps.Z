Abstract: The availability of good software tools is vital to simulation practitioners. The objective of the OSISIM project (Open System Integrated Simulator) is to set up an environment which integrates facilities and tools to build a communication system, and to study its performance. The environment is called AMS : Atelier for Modelling and Simulation. Using it, the network architect, i.e. the user of the atelier, can quickly construct, in a graphical environment, a concise system from models of several standard networks available in a specific library, and execute the system in an efficient manner. Starting with an outline of the components of the atelier, we describe the AMS prototype, and the internal structure of basic models to be included in it. Moreover, a concrete example of a communication system including a satellite backbone is provided to illustrate how AMS is used to simulate a such system.

Reference-contexts: He will use the atelier to build and validate an architectural choice, and/or to compare several possible ways of solving a problem. In the literature, we find the description of different toolkits dedicated to this field, such as OPNET (Optimised Network Engineering Tool) <ref> [4] </ref>, which is based on extended finite state machines and C language, or BONeS (Block Oriented Network Simulator) [5], which is based on block-oriented modelling paradigm, written in C++. Unlike these approaches, ours is based on queueing networks. 2 Actually, OPNET is a simulation tool for analysing communication networks.

Reference-contexts: The description of the system to be studied can be made graphically or textually by using the specific language ADL <ref> [7] </ref> designed for this purpose. ADL is an objectoriented language which provides a means for modular and hierarchical description of network architectures. So, the role of the ADL phase is to define a clear border between the editing and the simulation phases.

Reference-contexts: The portability of the atelier to other platforms becomes possible. In order to be operational in a reasonable time, AMS has been designed on the basis of existing and proved packages rather than starting from scratch. QNAP2, GSS [8] (Graphical Support System), MODLINE <ref> [9] </ref> and S-PLUS [10 ] are the main packages that are used to operate AMS. Based on those tools, a prototype of the atelier has been implemented. 3 This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 focuses on the components of the atelier.

Reference-contexts: The simulation time is reduced if some measurements are not computed. 9 5. CONCEPTS FOR ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION To have a more flexible interconnection between DBMs, the facet and superfacet concepts will be introduced first, and then, we will try to use the well known service user/service provider concept <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> . These concepts lead to a high degree of abstraction to validate the connections during the ADL phase. A DBM can be connected to a variety of other DBMs. We say that this current DBM (denoted C-DBM) has several facets.

Editing the architecture The simplified architecture is composed of a satellite backbone, and two Ethernet networks. <p> In our example, its corresponding switch has to be set to ON. Finally, the Plotter will allow us to draw some significant charts, such as the throughput versus congestion window or the throughput versus bit error rate which are the most results found in <ref> [14 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The tuning of our system fulfils the conditions chosen by Yang, as follows : the propagation delay on the satellite backbone is equal to 257.6 ms with a bandwidth of 1.544 Mb/s, the bridges are modelled as learning bridges <ref> [16] </ref> with a packet switching time equal to 0.1 ms, and the Ethernet bandwidth equal to 10Mb/s. Furthermore, a workstation on one LAN is assumed to be actively sending a file with a size of 500 Kbytes to the other workstation on the other LAN via the satellite repeater.
