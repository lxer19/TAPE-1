Abstract: A new algorithm to recover depth from a sequence of two or more stereoscopic images is presented. The algorithm, which uses a dynamic programming approach, builds a dense depth map and allows the camera displacement between each image to be any combination of rotation and translation. Since no smoothing constraint on depth is used, occlusions and depth discontinuities along the border of objects are preserved and easy to identify. For a given cost function, the algorithm finds the optimal correspondence along epipolar lines. In our case, this function is the difference of intensities between corresponding points, adjusted with a factor accounting for occlusions. Tested on nontrivial synthetic image sequences with true depth map available, we obtain a mean disparity error of less than one pixel. submitted august 7 th 1993 to the International Journal of Computer Vision

Reference-contexts: Usually, stereoscopic analysis is performed with two images. However, more images can be used to provide a better depth estimation. In particular, trinocular algorithms use three images to obtain more accurate depth map <ref> (Ayache 1989, Lee 1990) </ref>. The stereoscopic algorithm presented in this paper can efficiently provide a depth map and an occlusion map constructed from the analysis of multiple images obtained with arbitrary camera displacements. The depth map is dense and is not blurred across depth discontinuities. <p> Some solutions for image rectification were proposed <ref> (Ayache 1989) </ref>. zmax a zmin b E ab e ab zmax a zmin a ( ) m 34 e ab zmax a zmin a ( ) C ab zmin b E ab + -= B Depth Epipolar lines Solution space Optimal path a b 11 Our solution uses only the relative
