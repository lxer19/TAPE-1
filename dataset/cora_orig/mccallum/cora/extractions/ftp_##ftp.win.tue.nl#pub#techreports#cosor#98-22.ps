Abstract: We consider a processor sharing queue with several customer classes. For an arbitrary customer of class i we show that the sojourn time distribution is regularly varying of index i iff the service time distribution is regularly varying of index i , and derive an explicit asymptotic formula. Furthermore, the tail of the sojourn time distribution of customer class i is shown to be unaffected by the tails of the service time distributions of other customer classes, even if some of the latter tails are heavier. This result implies that, when the sojourn time of a customer is large, this is not due to long service requirements of other customer types. In particular, short-range dependent traffic does not suffer from longe-range dependent traffic if processor sharing is used as a service discipline.

Reference-contexts: As an illustration, the service disciplines Fist-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Last-Come-First-Served Preemptive Resume (LCFS-PR) and Processor Sharing (PS) are compared. A related study on the interplay between service disciplines and tail behaviour is <ref> [1] </ref>. Theorem 3.1 is a generalisation of Theorem 4.1 in [31]. The latter states, for a single class of customers, that the sojourn time distribution of an arbitrary customer is regularly varying of index ( being non-integer) iff the service time distribution is regularly varying of index . <p> The index is increased by 1 since an arbitrary customer has to wait with positive probability for a residual service time period of a customer of type 1. In <ref> [1] </ref> it has been shown that this is the case for all non-preemptive service disciplines where at most one customer is being served at the same time.

Reference-contexts: This property is of relevance for networks with different types of traffic where some of the traffic streams exhibit heavy-tailedness. 5. Concluding remarks 13 A related service discipline which receives quite some attention is generalised processor sharing, see e.g. <ref> [8] </ref> and references therein. An interesting subject for further research is to examine under which conditions Theorem 3.1 can be extended to this model. Another topic for further research is the extension of Theorem 3.1 to a larger class of (heavy-tailed) distributions.

Reference-contexts: The situation under the LCFS-PR regime is slightly better; in this case the sojourn time of an arbitrary customer is regularly varying of index 1 , like in the PS case, see <ref> [10] </ref>. However, the customers of type 1 still dominate the sojourn time of a customer of type i.

Reference-contexts: This result exhibits a crucial property of the processor sharing service discipline. For the GI/G/1 FCFS queue, a result of Cohen <ref> [11] </ref> implies that the sojourn time distribution is regularly varying of index 1 iff the service time is regularly varying of index . Hence, a heavy-tailed service time distribution gives rise to an even heavier tail of the sojourn time distribution.

This expression is given by (cf. Theorem 3.1 in [31]), for Re s 0, o 0: v (s; o ) = 1 X s k ff k (o ) : (2.2) The constants ff k (o ) are given by ff 0 (o ) := 1; ff 1 (o ) := o 1ae , and for k 2, k o <p> Since it follows immediately from (2.2) that v (s; o ) is analytic in s = 0, all moments of V (o ), denoted by v k (o ), are finite. They can be calculated recursively by (see <ref> [31] </ref>) v 0 (o ) := 1 and k X j v kj (o )ff j (o )(1) j : (2.7) In particular, we have the well known results (see [17, 27]), v 1 (o ) = 1 ae The first result can be used to obtain the mean sojourn time <p> Asymptotic results and their implications In this section we present asymptotic results for the classi sojourn time tail P (V i &gt; x) for large x. For the case of a single arrival stream and regularly varying service time distribution, explicit asymptotics are given in Theorem 4.1 of <ref> [31] </ref>, which states for the sojourn time V of an arbitrary customer that the following asymptotic formula holds: P (V &gt; x) P (B &gt; (1 ae)x); x ! 1; (3.1) when either V or B has a regularly varying distribution with non-integer index. <p> A question related to the one in the previous remark is whether this holds for a more general class of service time distributions. fl Remark 3.3 Although no other explicit asymptotic results (other than Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 4.1 of <ref> [31] </ref>) are available, it is possible to give upper bounds for both P (V (o ) &gt; x) and P (V i &gt; x) if the service time B i has an arbitrary distribution. <p> The derivation is the same as in the single arrival stream case, see <ref> [25, 30, 31] </ref> for more results and references. fl 4. Proof of Theorem 3.1 In this section we give a proof of Theorem 3.1.
