Title: A Data Model for Supporting On-Line Analytical Processing  
Author: Chang Li X. Sean Wang 
Affiliation: George Mason University  George Mason University  
Abstract: A database application, called on-line analytical processing (or OLAP) and aimed at providing business intelligence through on-line multidimensional data analysis, has become increasingly important due to the existence of huge amounts of on-line data. This paper formalizes a multidimensional data (MDD) model for OLAP, and develops an algebraic query language called grouping algebra. The basic component of the MDD model is a multidimensional cube, consisting of a number of relations (called dimensions) and for each combination of tuples (called a coordinate), one from each dimension, there is an associated data value. Each dimension is viewed as a basic grouping, i.e., each tuple in the dimension corresponds to the group consisting of all the coordinates that contain this tuple. In order to express user queries, relational algebra expressions are then extended to those on basic groupings for obtaining complex groupings, including order-oriented groupings (for expressing, e.g., cumulative sum). The paper then considers the environment where the multidimensional cubes are materialized views derived from base data situated at remote sites. A multidimensional cube algebra is introduced in order to facilitate the data derivation. The purpose of the paper is to establish a formal foundation for further research regarding database support for OLAP applications.

Reference-contexts: There are other extensions made to SQL to accommodate OLAP. For example, Red Brick's RI-SQL [Red95] includes certain order related aggregation functions such MovingAvg (n) and Cume (cumulative total). In contrast, this paper tried to introduce a general framework to express these functions. Recently, <ref> [AGS96] </ref> introduced a data model for multidimensional databases. Basically, [AGS96] uses a similar notion of cubes and gives a number of operations on cubes. The operations are similar to the six cube operations introduced here but with somewhat different capabilities.

Reference-contexts: A cube is similar to the concept of category in most of the SSDB data models in the literature (e.g., <ref> [CM89] </ref>). In our model, a multidimensional database (MDDB) consists of a finite set of multidimensional cubes and a finite set of relations. OLAP queries are posed on the MDDB using a grouping algebra, an extension of the relational algebra. <p> Tremendous progress has been made in this area. Special data models have been proposed and query languages introduced [Su83, OOM85, RR93]. Optimization techniques, in particular efficient physical storage management [SW94, NR94, SS93] and pre-aggregation <ref> [CM89] </ref>, have been investigated. Many of these results, especially the optimization techniques, can be directly used in OLAP systems. In this paper, we focused on providing a data model and algebraic query languages directly related to OLAP applications. There are other researches related to OLAP applications.

The paper <ref> [GBLP96] </ref> introduced a new grouping operation CUBE for the SQL group-by clause.

Reference-contexts: Optimizing OLAP queries is another important research area that is beyond the scope of this paper, where pre-computation is a promising idea. Certain cube aggregations can be pre-computed to expedite query processing. However, due to storage limitation, the system needs to select a subset of these aggregations. The paper <ref> [HRU96] </ref> provided an algorithm that efficiently selects such a subset under system restrictions. 8 Conclusion This paper formalized an MDDB data model and introduced a grouping algebra as its query language. The query language is flexible in expressing many intuitive OLAP queries, including order-related queries.
