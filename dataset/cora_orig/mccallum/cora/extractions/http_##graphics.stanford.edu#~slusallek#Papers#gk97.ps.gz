Abstract: Hierarchical methods have proven to be a very powerful tool for computations of global illumination solutions in virtual worlds. Since the introduction of the hierarchical radiosity algorithm, many improvements on the method have been made, but the general structure of the algorithm remained unchanged. The complete computation is steered by a refiner method (often called oracle), which decides on the resolution level of the hierarchical computations. In this paper we show several possibilities for such refiners, discuss their advantages and disadvantages and show first results measuring the computation error for some test scenes.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical radiosity is an algorithm to compute a piecewise constant approximation of B p (x). We will not describe the algorithm in detail here, good descriptions of the method can be found in <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. The heart of the algorithm is the so called refiner, that steers the hierarchical computation. In the following we give an overview of different refiners that have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: Because the exact analytical computation of the induced error is not possible in general cases, the error has to be approximated by the refiner function. Since hierarchical radiosity was introduced, many optimizations for this function have been published, in order to increase performance, achieve higher precision, or avoid artifacts <ref> [10, 3, 5, 6, 2] </ref>. Furthermore, it is an important question which norm is used to measure the error, i.e. with regard to which error norm the error is optimized. <p> These bounds are conservative and often too pessimistic. Nevertheless, the distance between the bounds can be used as error mea sure for the refinement decision. sampling: In <ref> [2] </ref> the point-to-area form factor is computed between several points on the receiver and the complete sender. Using these form factor samples, the range of induced radiosity at the receiver can be determined fairly well. The width of this range can be used as a good error approximation. <p> Nevertheless, many problems arise, if the occlusion is due to several occluders, and if the distance between occluder and receiver varies strongly etc. Using the sampling refiner has the advantage that partial visibility can be considered naturally by reducing the lower transport bound. In <ref> [2] </ref> the authors compute the approximate visibility v and scale the sampled lower bound on the radiosity at the receiver by the factor j2v 1j. <p> Furthermore, the point-to-area form factor used in <ref> [2] </ref> is only available for polygons and is quite expensive to evaluate. * The bounded radiosity refiner is also quite expensive but has the big advantage that no sampling is used and thus no sampling artifacts as in scene 3 can appear.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Global illumination computations, in particular the simplification of radiosity simulations, have been a field of research for many years. One big step forward was the introduction of the hierarchical radiosity method <ref> [4] </ref>. The aim of that algorithm is to find an approximation for the radiosity transport between two patches p and q. <p> The induced error is assumed to be proportional to the form factor itself <ref> [4] </ref>. bounding: In [11] a method was presented to compute conservative bounds on the light transport between two arbitrary objects. These bounds are conservative and often too pessimistic.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that using this algorithm, only a constant number of interactions will be established for each patch and that this thresholding of the local error within one pair of interacting patches also results in convergence of the global error of the solution <ref> [7] </ref>. Because the exact analytical computation of the induced error is not possible in general cases, the error has to be approximated by the refiner function.

Reference-contexts: Espe cially in the presence of shadow boundaries and other illumination details, it is very difficult to find a good visual metric for measuring the error of a solution. As an example in <ref> [8] </ref> a metric is described taking the size of features into consideration. However, considering aspects of human perception is not the aim of this paper. As mentioned before, the selection of classes is rather orthogonal to the error norm.

These bounds are conservative and often too pessimistic. <p> Therefore, no further refinement of these interactions will be enforced, however small the error threshold is, resulting in a biased solution. Bounded radiosity was developed to avoid such sampling problems and thus does not exhibit that behaviour <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 Conclusion The heart of every hierarchical global illumination algorithm is the refiner function, which tries to optimize the error of the computed approximation.

Reference-contexts: One possible approach is to search for the closest occluder and try to approximate the error due to visibility by some heuristics (something similar is done in the Irradiance Gradients algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>). Nevertheless, many problems arise, if the occlusion is due to several occluders, and if the distance between occluder and receiver varies strongly etc. Using the sampling refiner has the advantage that partial visibility can be considered naturally by reducing the lower transport bound.
