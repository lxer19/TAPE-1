Title: Mining Association Rules in Hypertext Databases

Abstract: Association rule techniques traditionally aim to mine information from databases consisting of a set of flat transaction records. In this work we propose a generalisation of the notion of association rule in the context of flat transactions to that of a composite association rule in the context of a structured directed graph, such as the world-wide-web. The techniques proposed aim at finding patterns in the user behaviour when traversing such a hypertext system. We redefine the concepts of confidence and support for composite association rules, which are trails of links representing a user's navigation session; the actual data may be obtained from log files. Two algorithms to mine composite association rules are exhibited: one is a modification of the directed graph Depth-First-Search algorithm, and the other uses an incremental approach to build the set of composite rules of size n + 1 from the set of composite rules of size n. Extensive experiments with random data were conducted in order to analyse the comparative performance of the two algorithms and to measure the sensitivity of the results to variation of confidence and support thresholds. The experiments show that, in spite of the worst-case complexity analysis which indicates exponential behaviour, in practice the algorithms complexity, measured in the number of iterations performed, is linear in the number of nodes traversed.

Reference-contexts: Several data mining techniques have been being studied and among them is the problem of mining association rules in large datasets of flat transactions. The problem of mining association rules was first introduced by Agrawal et al. <ref> [AIS93] </ref>, and has been being intensively studied since then, see for example [AMS + 96, MTV94, PCY95, SON95, Toi96, HF95, SA96, FMMT96, CA97]. The standard example consists of a large dataset of supermarket sales transactions. Each transaction reveals the items purchased by a particular client at the supermarket. <p> We can also see how the graph density and monotonic support definition affect the rules size. 8 6 Related Work Techniques for mining association rules between items in large data sets have been an active topic of research since <ref> [AIS93] </ref>, Chen et al. [CPY96] were the first to study the application of these techniques to the problem of mining user access patterns in a web environment.

Reference-contexts: We think, however, that this innovative approach has two drawbacks. The first is the way backward references are discarded with the justification that they occur for user's ease of traveling. As we can see in a study which is focused on user behaviour when browsing the web <ref> [Cat95] </ref>, the users of a web browser use the back command intensively, which in the study constituted 40:6% of the interactions. Moreover, log data does not provide enough information to distinguish between the use of the back command from the selection of an identical link.

Reference-contexts: Knowing the user's patterns of behaviour can help the service provider to improve the design of the underlying hypertext system, providing links to the pages with the desired content. The idea of applying association rules techniques to this context was first suggested by Chen et al. in <ref> [CPY96] </ref>. Therein a method was proposed to mine access patterns in an information providing environment where related documents or objects are connected by oriented links. <p> We propose a different approach based on the generalisation of the concept of association rule rather than pre-processing the server data into a form which is then amenable to analysis by the standard association rule algorithms as in <ref> [CPY96] </ref>. In our approach the semantics of the user's navigation are maintained thus alleviating the danger for over evaluating references when the input is converted to standard association rule form. <p> We can also see how the graph density and monotonic support definition affect the rules size. 8 6 Related Work Techniques for mining association rules between items in large data sets have been an active topic of research since [AIS93], Chen et al. <ref> [CPY96] </ref> were the first to study the application of these techniques to the problem of mining user access patterns in a web environment.
