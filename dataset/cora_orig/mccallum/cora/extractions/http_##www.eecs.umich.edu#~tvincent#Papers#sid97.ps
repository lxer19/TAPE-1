Abstract: We present experimental results validating a new technique that achieves accurate endpoint for a TFT back channel recess etch. These results show a 90% reduction in the standard deviation of final channel thickness as compared to timed etches.

Reference-contexts: This is expected since intrinsic a-Si:H and n+ doped a-Si:H are quite similar. In order to apply an OES endpoint technique, an emission line corresponding to an etch by-product needs to be identified. Glueck et. al <ref> [1, 2] </ref> have identified the 240nm line as a potential line to distinguish the n+/intrinsic interface. However, we have not been successful at reproducing this result in our reactor. Also, it may be desirable to use non-CF 4 etch chemistries to improve the n+ a-Si:H to intrinsic a-Si:H selectivity.

Reference-contexts: In standard practice, endpoint is called when a set number of fringes has passed or when a sharp slope change occurs because the etch has reached the interface between two layers of contrasting refractive index <ref> [3] </ref>. The former technique is not accurate enough at the wavelengths for which a-Si:H is transparent, while the latter situation does not hold because of the sim 1 ilarity between doped and undoped a-Si:H refractive indexes.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is possible to endpoint at any desired remaining film thickness. This method is based on Extended Kalman Filtering, and will be termed EKF-R. The algorithmic details of this method are reported in <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. The goal of the experiments described here was to quantify the reduction in the variance of remaining a-Si:H using an EKF-R endpoint as compared to timed etches, which are current standard practice.
