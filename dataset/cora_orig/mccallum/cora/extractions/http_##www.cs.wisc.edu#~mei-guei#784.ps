Reference-contexts: This algorithm claims to be effective in decomposition, in particular for the repeated access to several records in a page which is currently in the buffer pool. To evaluate the overall improvement, a set of data was generated by Wisconsin Benchmark <ref> [DeW93] </ref> and several standard queries in Wisconsin Benchmark were employed with and without compression in Minibase.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The purpose of our implementation is to enhance the functionality in Mini-base by adding group by with various aggregates. Later, with the compression technique imported <ref> [GRS] </ref>, the performance study regarding the improvement in query execution was analyzed. Source of data for creating tables was from Wisconsin Benchmark, and standard queries were employed. This report is organized as follows: Section 2, a brief summary of the implementation is presented. <p> Since the aggregate AVG is written in the aggregating column, there is a problem of type mismatch for outputting purpose. 2 3 Query Execution Using Compression Techniques The compression technique is proposed by <ref> [GRS] </ref> and imported into Minibase. This algorithm claims to be effective in decomposition, in particular for the repeated access to several records in a page which is currently in the buffer pool.
