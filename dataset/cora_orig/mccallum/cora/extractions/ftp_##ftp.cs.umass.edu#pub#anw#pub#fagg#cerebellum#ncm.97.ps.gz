Abstract: We present a model of cerebellar learning for control of limb movements. The model learns to generate relatively smooth and direct arm movements, while not assuming (as some models do) a high-level input that specifies a preplanned trajectory. The model controls a simulated two-joint arm, which is actuated by a set of six muscles. Control of the arm is shared by a learning cerebellar module and a hard-wired extra-cerebellar (EC) system. The cerebellar module consists of a group of independent submodules, referred to as Adjustable Pattern Generators (APGs). Each APG is made up of a set of Purkinje cells and a single cerebellar nuclear cell. Activation of an APG's nuclear cell drives a muscle synergy (a subset of the muscles). The EC system is responsible for producing low-quality corrective movements in situations where the cerebellar module is unable to bring the arm to the specified target. Via proprioceptive inputs, the modeled inferior olive assesses directional errors in cerebellar-generated movements by observing subsequent corrective movements produced by the EC system.

Reference-contexts: At an abstract level, the state encoder models the transformation that is performed by granule cells and associated inhibitory interneurons with information delivered by the mossy fibers. This transformation is thought to provide (via the parallel fibers (PFs)) a sparse, expansive encoding of the incoming state information <ref> [1] </ref>. In the model, this information consists of delayed plant state, recent motor commands, and other contextual signals. The sparse, expansive code is computed using a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) [1, 17]. <p> In the model, this information consists of delayed plant state, recent motor commands, and other contextual signals.

Thus, on average, the eligible synapses from the PFs to the PCs within AP G k will be decremented via LTD <ref> [1, 3, 11] </ref>. The next trial that the same movement is executed, the PCs of AP G k will be less active, resulting in a higher level of activity for AP G k .

Reference-contexts: The CF behavior draws in two key ways from the behavior observed in cat: 1. From the perspective of the cerebellar-generated movement, the corrective movement made by the EC module is seen essentially as passive (or unexpected) <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, CF signals only deviate from their background firing rate when corrective movements are initiated. 2. The increase (or decrease) in CF firing probability is a function of the rate of stretch of the muscles.

Reference-contexts: Here, we present a model of cerebellar learning for limb control which represents one perspective on these questions. Specifically: 1.

Hence, it is important to think of the currency of cerebellar output in terms of a muscle synergy space, rather than directly in terms of joint torques or the activation of individual muscles. 2.

Reference-contexts: Studies in cat show that when a limb is passively moved by an external force, CFs fire in response to the proprioceptive inputs from the the limb <ref> [5] </ref>. In addition, the CFs are differentially responsive to the direction of limb movement. During active movements (such as stepping), some CF responses are inhibited, except at the very end of movement, where certain perturbations are likely to occur (e.g. due to misanticipation of the height of the step).
