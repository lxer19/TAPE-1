Abstract: The most secure type of grasp of a frictionless woorkpiece is the form-closure grasp. However, task constraints may make achieving form-closure impossible or undesirable. In this case, one needs to employ a force-closure 1 grasp. In this paper, we study the subclass of force-closure grasps known as second-order stable grasps, which typically have a small number of contacts. We derive conditions for second-order stability and represent second-order stability cells as conjunctions of equations and inequalities in the configuration variables of the system. These cells are the subsets of the system's configuration space for which the frictionless workpiece is second-order stable. We also determine the minimum and maximum numbers of contacts necessary for second-order stability. Our results are applied to a simple planar whole-arm manipulation system to generate one of its second-order stability cells.

Reference-contexts: This condition guaranteed that the grasping fingers would generate restoring forces in response to all deflections of the grasped object. Similar uses of second-order stability in grasping can be found in <ref> [1, 6, 10] </ref>. Previous studies of rigid body grasping have not considered second-order stability. Instead, researchers have concentrated on form-closure grasps, because they are the most resistant to external disturbing forces [7, 13, 11].

Reference-contexts: The C-space X , of the system is the space of dimension n q + n containing all possible values of q and . In our analysis, we utilize subsets of C-space corresponding to various topologically equivalent contact states called "contact formations" <ref> [2] </ref>. A contact formation (CF) is a set of elemental contacts, where an elemental contact is one between a pair of features on two bodies. Examples include, edge-edge and face vertex contacts.

Reference-contexts: Along this curve, the determinant of the 3 fi 3 wrench matrix, W n , of the three-contact CF, is zero, which turns out to be quite significant in the algebraic geometry of CF-cells <ref> [3] </ref>. 5.3 Minimum Numbers of Contacts It is known that the minimum number of contacts required for first-order stability is n q (six and three in the spatial and planar cases, respectively).

Reference-contexts: Two Contacts Proof: The first three necessary and sufficient conditions result directly from solving the equilibrium equation (16), subject to the requirement that the contact forces be compressive, inequality (17). The fourth condition was derived using the definitions of the C-functions f geo;i given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Choosing the coordinate frames of the world and workpiece to coincide with their origins at the point of intersection of the contact normals, the left null space of the Jacobian matrix, @f geo @q , (the wrench matrix) yields Z T = [0 0 1].

Reference-contexts: Second-order stable grasps are characterized by a small number of linearly independent contacts: less than six in the spatial case and less than three in the planar case. Thus second-order stable grasps do not have enough contacts to achieve form closure <ref> [7] </ref> or first-order stability [16]. Second-order stability exists when point representing the configuration of the workpiece is at the bottom of a potential energy well that is smooth (specifically quadratic) in at least one direction. <p> Similar uses of second-order stability in grasping can be found in [1, 6, 10]. Previous studies of rigid body grasping have not considered second-order stability. Instead, researchers have concentrated on form-closure grasps, because they are the most resistant to external disturbing forces <ref> [7, 13, 11] </ref>. However, it is clear that such grasps are less mobile and therefore less useful in dexterous manipulation, since then the goal is grasp reorientation, not a strong static grasp.

This leads to a holo-nomic model that predicts motions uniquely. While the frictionless assumption is not appropriate in many potential grasping and whole-arm manipulation applications, we have chosen it for two reasons.

Reference-contexts: Second, we have analytically and experimentally verified that under certain conditions, the motion predicted by the frictionless, quasistatic model is a good approximation to the motion predicted by the analogous quasistatic and dynamic models with friction <ref> [15] </ref>. In particular, this paper is devoted to frictionless grasps which have second-order stability. Second-order stable grasps are characterized by a small number of linearly independent contacts: less than six in the spatial case and less than three in the planar case.

Reference-contexts: This type of manipulation has been referred to as whole-arm manipulation. The task of planning the joint trajectories required to reposition and reorient the workpiece within the whole-arm manipulator is referred to as the whole-arm manipulation planning problem <ref> [17] </ref>. Little progress has been made toward a general, systematic approach to the whole-arm manipulation planning problem, primarily due to the difficulties associated with predicting the motion of bodies with multiple concurrent contacts. <p> Examples include, edge-edge and face vertex contacts. The existence of the i th elemental contact causes the distance function corresponding to the two contacting features, the geometric C-function, f geo;i (q ; ), to be zero <ref> [17] </ref>. The maintenance of a CF causes a vector of C-functions, f geo , to be zero, thereby defining a "surface" in C-space. The portion of each of these surfaces for which bodies do not interpenetrate is referred to as a CF-cell [17] and is denoted by CF. 4 Stability Conditions <p> f geo;i (q ; ), to be zero <ref> [17] </ref>.

Since SS-cells are defined in the (n q + n )-dimensional C-space, X , we see that the dimension of Case-1 SS-cells is n l. Interestingly, the dimensions of typical Case-2 and Case-3 SS-cells are also n l [18]. <p> This portion is shown projected onto joint space. The configuration of the system shown on the right side of the Figure emphasizes that we have not enforced the constraints that the contacts lie on the fingers.
