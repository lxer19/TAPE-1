Abstract: The evolution of a population can be guided by phenotypic traits acquired by members of that population during their lifetime. This phenomenon, known as the Baldwin Effect, can speed the evolutionary process as traits that are initially acquired become genetically specified in later generations. This paper presents conditions under which this genetic assimilation can take place. As well as the benefits that lifetime adaptation can give a population, there may be a cost to be paid for that adaptive ability. It is the evolutionary trade-off between these costs and benefits that provides the selection pressure for acquired traits to become genetically specified. It is also noted that genotypic space, in which evolution operates, and phenotypic space, on which adaptive processes (such as learning) operate, are, in general, of a different nature. To guarantee an acquired characteristic can become genetically specified, then these spaces must have the property of neighbourhood correlation which means that a small distance between two individuals in phenotypic space implies that there is a small distance between the same two individuals in genotypic space.

Reference-contexts: This was done to simulate the situation where a population has converged on one trait and then, due to environmental change, it has become favourable to exhibit a different trait <ref> (Anderson, 1995) </ref>. Each individual's fitness genotype is copied to its phenotype and learning takes place as described in Section 4.2.

Reference-contexts: In a simulation in which the fitness evaluation includes the learning phase, such that the individuals are under continual assessment, as in an incremental learning algorithm, there are costs in all the groups that are applicable. Still more sophisticated behavioural simulations as in <ref> (Cecconi et al., 1996) </ref> include a greater number of the costs outlined above. 2.3 Cost / Benefit Trade-off The inclusion of learning can both be beneficial and detrimental to the fitnesses of individuals in a population and therefore there is an evolutionary trade-off as to whether it is adopted.

Reference-contexts: If the learned phenotype is fixed and evaluated, it will achieve a different score and the difference between this learned fitness, and the innate fitness constitutes the benefits of learning. In some simulations, this learned fitness is taken as the evolutionary fitness as in <ref> (Chalmers, 1990) </ref>. <p> This classification allows us to look at which of the costs are applicable in any given set of evolutionary circumstances. In situations such as that presented by <ref> (Chalmers, 1990) </ref> in which the evolutionary performance of back-propagation neural networks is assessed after they have learnt, 5 only the costs in groups 4 and 5 are applicable.

Reference-contexts: Possible mechanisms for reducing these costs in nature are parental care and animal play behaviour <ref> (Fagen, 1981) </ref>. Lots of juvenile animals practice the more dangerous behaviours, such as hunting or fighting, that they will require later as adults, whilst they are under the protective care of their parents.

Reference-contexts: Constant costs. `One-off' costs may have to be paid by each individual for the ability to learn: * Increased ontogenetic costs. Increased energy may have to be expended to develop a more complex regulatory system for the plasticity of learning <ref> (Johnston, 1982) </ref>. 4 Although these costs may vary over evolutionary time, for example an ontogenetic process may become more efficient, they are not a function of the duration of the learning period or lifetime of each individual. 4. Individual non-specific costs.

Reference-contexts: The goals of evolution and learning are to produce phenotypes with the highest fitness according to Kauffman's NK fitness landscape model <ref> (Kauffman, 1993) </ref>. It is expected that the majority of the readership is familiar with NK fitness landscapes but for those who are not, here is the briefest of descriptions.

Reference-contexts: An individual with the same behaviour innately specified does not go through this period of reduced performance and so it achieves a higher fitness score. The learning individual is penalized during the learning period <ref> (Mayley, 1996a) </ref>. * Delayed reproductive effort.
