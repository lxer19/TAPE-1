Abstract: Introduction The first three articles in this series have examined the language aspects of Java and some very simple applications, both stand-alone and applet versions. In this article I would like to complete the series by developing an application that will tie (most) all of the features we have discussed so far, together. At the risk of alienating windows programmers, this application will not be an applet, although it could easily be converted into such a thing. The primary reason for this space, I try to show complete programs and Windows code by nature is very long and after a while it does not add incremental knowledge of the subject. For that reason I have am choosing two topics that should be near and dear to most UNIX programmers, threads and networking. In this case the networking will be the more exciting for a couple of reasons. First, since there is a lot of security features built into the Java language, using a network application (or applet) will be one excellent method to extend beyond the boundaries of your browser to collect data in an organized fashion. Another good reason for this example that it is built on the very well established model of UNIX sockets. This program example will also allow us to concentrate on the package facilities of java.net without worrying about the details of the actual application. Lastly the client-server model is an excellent way to lead into an extension of the model which will include use of threads for multiple connections to the server. Before I begin all of this I should like to provide three references which proved to be invaluable. Active Java, by Adam Freeman and Darrel Ince from Addison-Wesley, 1996; Network Programming in UNIX, by Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley, 1993; and my dear friend Priscilla who as far as I am concerned is a Java Goddess and should have sainthood conferred on her immediately. (Note from author: I know this personal note may not make the final draft but I would like to make an acknowledgment somewhere since this is the last article.)
