Abstract: Abusive messages (flames) can be both a source of frustration and a waste of time for Internet users. This paper describes some approaches to flame recognition, including a prototype system, Smokey. Smokey builds a 47-element feature vector based on the syntax and semantics of each sentence, combining the vectors for the sentences within each message. A training set of 720 messages was used by Quinlans C4.5 decision-tree generator to determine feature-based rules that were able to correctly categorize 64% of the flames and 98% of the non-flames in a separate test set of 460 messages. Additional techniques for greater accuracy and user customization are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: Epithets The final class of insulting statements is epithets, short insulting phrases <ref> (Allan and Burridge 1991, Jochnowitz 1987) </ref>. For example, get followed within ten characters by life, lost, real, clue, with it, or used to it. Other epithets are two-word phrases, such as drop dead.

Reference-contexts: This rule proved to be one of the most useful: 18% of the flames included epithets, and none of the non-flames included them. Polite Rules The politeness rule class is entered if a sentence does not contain an obscene word. A message is considered polite <ref> (Brown and Levinson 1987) </ref> if it contains thank (but not no thanks), please, or constructs with would, such as Would you be willing to email me your logo. Praise Rules The praise class is entered if a sentence does not contain an obscene word.

Reference-contexts: Possibilities for future work include learning from dictionaries and thesauri <ref> (Dolan et al 1993) </ref>, user feedback, or proximity to known insults; morphological analysis; spelling and grammar correction; and analyzing logical parse trees of sentences. Related Work. Surprisingly little has been written on the grammar of insults in English. Ruwet (1982) has written about the grammar of French insults.

Reference-contexts: Sack has written a system to automatically determine the ideological bias of a text (Sack 1995). Email classification through regular expressions is already in use, such as through the mail program extensions Procmail, Mailagent, and Filter. A different method of filtering unstructured text is through collaboration, such as Tapestry <ref> (Goldberg et al 1992) </ref>, allowing users to rate individual pieces of bulk mail (from mailing lists or news groups) or individual senders; other users can decide whether to read messages based on others appraisals.

Reference-contexts: A separate class of insults is sitespecific phrases. These include names (Watergate is only mentioned in flames to The Right Side of the Web), derogatory nicknames (Slick Willy), and terms that are primarily used when insulting a specific group (e.g., calling liberals commies or conservatives fascists) <ref> (Hayakawa and Hayakawa 1990) </ref>. Epithets The final class of insulting statements is epithets, short insulting phrases (Allan and Burridge 1991, Jochnowitz 1987). For example, get followed within ten characters by life, lost, real, clue, with it, or used to it. Other epithets are two-word phrases, such as drop dead.

Reference-contexts: Method Human Message Ratings Each of the 1222 messages was rated by four speakers of American English employed by Microsoft who were not otherwise involved in this research. Each message was rated by two men and two women, because gender differences in online <ref> (Herring 1995) </ref> and offline (Jay 1992) flaming have been observed. No individual rated messages from more than one site, because it was important to remember the intended recipients political orientation.

Reference-contexts: The sexpressions are processed through rules written in Emacs Lisp, producing a feature vector for each message. This phase can also generate output showing where each rule applied. 5. The resulting feature vectors are evaluated with simple rules, produced by the decision tree generator C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref>. I removed duplicate, excessively-long, and meaningless messages (someone randomly pressing keys) from the collections; this could be automated.

Reference-contexts: I removed duplicate, excessively-long, and meaningless messages (someone randomly pressing keys) from the collections; this could be automated. Steps 1 and 3 of Smokey are trivial and will not be further discussed in this paper. The parser, used in step 2, is discussed elsewhere <ref> (Richardson 1994) </ref> and, as appropriate, in this paper. The s-expressions used by the fourth step to represent each sentence include (1) an ordinary string, (2) a list of words in the sentence, and (3) a tree encoding the grammatical structure of each sentence.
