Abstract: The problem of accurate depth estimation using stereo in the presence of specular reflection is addressed. Specular reflection, a fundamental and ubiquitous reflection mechanism, is viewpoint dependent and can cause large intensity differences at corresponding points, resulting in significant depth errors. We analyze the physics of specular reflection and the geometry of stereopsis which lead to a relationship between stereo vergence, surface roughness, and the likelihood of a correct match. Given a lower bound on surface roughness, an optimal binocular stereo configuration can be determined which maximizes precision in depth estimation despite specular reflection. However, surface roughness is difficult to estimate in unstructured environments. Therefore, trinocular configurations, independent of surface roughness, are determined such that at each scene point visible to all sensors, at least one stereo pair can produce correct depth. We have developed a simple algorithm to reconstruct depth from the multiple stereo pairs.

Reference-contexts: The robustness of a stereo system is characterized to a large extent by its ability to obtain accurate depth estimates of scenes comprising objects with different reflectance properties. The stereo correspondence problem [ <ref> (Barnard and Fischler, 1982) </ref> ] is inherently under-constrained. Therefore, constraints have to be imposed by making assumptions regarding scene reflectance and structure. A common assumption is that intensities at corresponding points in the images are identical.

Reference-contexts: The end-effector is equipped with a camera to obtain different viewing directions. We use two uniformly rough cylindrical objects wrapped with different surfaces (see Figure 7); a gift wrapper and a roughened xerox quality paper. Their surface roughness was measured [ <ref> (Bhat and Nayar, 1994) </ref> ] , and the values obtained are = 3:5 ffi and = 6:3 ffi , respectively. The differing roughness can be also be seen from the object images. In order to use approximately the same relative threshold, similar random patterns on the surfaces were marked.

Reference-contexts: There is a close relationship between the relative threshold and the measure used for correspondence. Consider a robust correlation measure like in ( [ <ref> (Bhat and Nayar, 1996) </ref> ] ) that is relatively insensitive to relative threshold, i.e when the relative threshold varies in a certain range, the measure remains unchanged. This is unlike normalized correlation which changes continuosly with relative threshold.

Reference-contexts: Ching et al [ (Ching et al., 1993) ] developed an empirical correlation based technique to detect and avoid specular reflection when the camera is active. On a different note, Blake [ <ref> (Blake, 1985) </ref> ] related the movement of a highlight to the Hessian of the surface which describes local surface geometry. The above techniques assume ideal specular reflection which is an extreme case as roughness tends to zero. Current stereo algorithms are therefore seriously deficient in dealing with specular reflection.

Reference-contexts: Thus, all the above techniques must incorporate ways to detect and handle mismatches due to specular reflection. To overcome the problem of depth errors due to strong highlights, Brelstaff and Blake [ <ref> (Brelstaff and Blake, 1988) </ref> ] suggested excising them from images before matching. Removal of highlights is difficult in images of real scenes and is an active area of research [ (Nayar et al., 1993) ] .

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, even if the right match is located using the first stereo pair, it may not be possible to verify it in the third view as the corresponding point intensity can be greatly different. Dhond and Aggarwal [ <ref> (Dhond and Aggarwal, 1991) </ref> ] , in developing a feature-based system, analyzed the cost and benefit of adding an additional view for matching and concluded that the increased reliability of three view systems outweighs the added computational cost involved.

Reference-contexts: Smith [ (Smith, 1986) ] proposed an elegant alternative to point correspondence. His approach attempts to find surface depth profiles that are consistent with image intensity profiles. Unfortunately, this too does not extend to handle specular reflection. Gennert [ <ref> (Gennert, 1988) </ref> ] suggested a method to relax the Lambertian assmuption. It modelled intensities at corresponding points as being related by a multiplicative factor that varies smoothly.

Reference-contexts: The redundant views provide strong constraints since correspondence must be established with respect to all images. In particular, trinocular stereo systems systems using three views have been employed to a measure of success [ <ref> (Ito and Ishii, 1986) </ref> ] , [ (Yachida et al., 1986) ] . Here, the general strategy used for correspondence is to locate possible matches using one stereo pair and verify each potential match using the image from the third viewpoint.

Reference-contexts: In other words, depth resolution increases with increasing vergence. A.2. A Statistical Interpretation The reason for minimizing I diff can be viewed in a statistical sense. We use the following model for the images in one-dimension [ <ref> (Matthies, 1992) </ref> ] : I 1 (x) = I d (x) + I s1 (n (x)) where I d (x) corresponds to the diffuse component, I s (n (x)) refers to the specular component, n (x) is the surface normal of the scene point projected as x, d m is the

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, the change in diffuse component with viewing direction is generally much less pronounced than that in the specular component. 2.1. Specular Reflection Specular reflection occurs at the boundary between surface and medium. It comprises of two components a spike and a lobe [ <ref> (Nayar et al., 1991) </ref> ] . We do not deal with surfaces smooth in comparison to wavelength of incident light as they are rare in real scenes. 4 Hence, specular reflection refers to the lobe only.

Reference-contexts: However, they as 3 sumed diffuse surfaces and hence mismatches due to specular reflection were not considered in estimating reliability. A more complete analysis should deal with specular reflection in both binocular and trinocular stereo systems. Okutomi and Kanade [ <ref> (Okutomi and Kanade, 1993) </ref> ] developed a convincing, practical multiple view system. It uses stereo pairs taken with different baselines to compute precise depth estimates overcoming ambiguities due to repetitive texture.

Reference-contexts: Reflection Mechanisms Surfaces exhibit two forms of reflectance diffuse and specular. Diffuse reflection occurs due to subsurface scattering of light. It is often assumed to be Lambertian, an assumption shown to be incorrect for surfaces with macroscopic roughness [ <ref> (Oren and Nayar, 1994) </ref> ] . Nonetheless, the change in diffuse component with viewing direction is generally much less pronounced than that in the specular component. 2.1. Specular Reflection Specular reflection occurs at the boundary between surface and medium.

Reference-contexts: The depth z of P is: z = 2 ) 2 ) Two quantities to estimate depth resolution are the absolute range error [ (Verri and Torre, 1986) ] and the expected range error [ <ref> (Rodriguez and Aggarwal, 1988) </ref> ] .

Reference-contexts: However, this scheme requires two illumination conditions which makes it unattractive for passive stereo. Furthermore, it does not extend to specular surfaces because the ratio loses its invariance to viewer position. Smith [ <ref> (Smith, 1986) </ref> ] proposed an elegant alternative to point correspondence. His approach attempts to find surface depth profiles that are consistent with image intensity profiles. Unfortunately, this too does not extend to handle specular reflection. Gennert [ (Gennert, 1988) ] suggested a method to relax the Lambertian assmuption.

Reference-contexts: The lobe spreads in directions other than and including the specular direction, the width of its distribution depending on surface roughness. This is described by the Torrance-Sparrow model [ <ref> (Torrance and Sparrow, 1967) </ref> ] as outlined below. A surface is viewed as a collection of planar mi-crofacets, each behaving like a perfect mirror. A rough surface can be modeled using a probability distribution for the slopes of the microfacets.
