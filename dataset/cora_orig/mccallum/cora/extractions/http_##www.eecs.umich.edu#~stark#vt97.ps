Abstract: In this paper we consider the performance of different coding schemes for DS-SS in a nonselective Rician faded channel. The Nordstrom-Robinson(NR) code, a nonlinear code that has large distance for a given rate, combined with a trellis code, is examined. A bound is developed on the error probability for this trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson(TCNR) code with noncoherent reception over a frequency-nonselective Rayleigh or Rician fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise. This bound is tighter than the standard union bound. Our results indicate that the standard union bound can be significantly different from the more accurate results obtained from the improved union bound. In addition, there is a considerable coding gain at high signal-to-noise ratio for the TCNR code over the conventional DS-SS code at the same date rate.

Reference-contexts: This, however, sacrifices code rate. A method to reduce the number of nearest neighbors without sacrificing data rate is to use a combination of an orthogonal code with a trellis <ref> [1] </ref> at the expense of complexity. In this paper we wish to explore a coding scheme to achieve higher data rate and lower error probability. In Section II, the Nordstrom-Robinson (NR) code [3] is introduced. <p> If additional complexity is allowed, we can further modify the NR code to increase the minimum distance to 8 and only slightly decrease the rate to 6/16. To do this, a 4-state trellis with branches labeled by the MNR codewords is used <ref> [1] </ref>. As is shown in Fig.1, we label each of the outgoing branches of the trellis with the cosets of the MNR code to form a trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson (TCNR) code, an example of finite-state codes [2]. <p> the same bit error probability the signal-to-noise ratio needed is reduced for the trellis coded system by the factor G = k + l + 1 2 (2M 2) a (2M ) &gt;From the above, by finding the value of G, we may predict the performance of other Kerdock codes <ref> [1] </ref>, [3] in trellis-coded version with noncoherent reception. For the case of length 64 Kerdock codes the gain is 4.60dB while for the case of length 256 Kerdock codes the gain is 4.93dB. Of course the gain is achieved with significantly more complex receivers.

Reference-contexts: As is shown in Fig.1, we label each of the outgoing branches of the trellis with the cosets of the MNR code to form a trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson (TCNR) code, an example of finite-state codes <ref> [2] </ref>. To encode, we divided each 6 information bits into 2 bits and 4 bits. The 2 bits determine which coset, and hence which outgoing branch, of the trellis, while the 4 bits determine which codeword in that coset is transmitted.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we wish to explore a coding scheme to achieve higher data rate and lower error probability. In Section II, the Nordstrom-Robinson (NR) code <ref> [3] </ref> is introduced. This nonlinear code, a member of the class of Kerdock codes [3], has good distance and rate parameters, and can be efficiently decoded with a noncoherent soft decision algorithm. The NR code has 256 codewords of length 16 with the minimum distance 6. <p> In this paper we wish to explore a coding scheme to achieve higher data rate and lower error probability.

This nonlinear code, a member of the class of Kerdock codes [3], has good distance and rate parameters, and can be efficiently decoded with a noncoherent soft decision algorithm. The NR code has 256 codewords of length 16 with the minimum distance 6. The 256 codewords are divided into 8 cosets, each with 32 biorthogonal codewords. <p> If we start with this biorthogonal code, we can increase the number of code-words up to 256 by carefully adding selected cosets of the biorthogonal code to the original code, with the minimum distance slightly decreasing to 6. By doing so we get the nonlinear Nordstrom-Robinson (NR) code <ref> [3] </ref> . The 256 codewords are divided into 8 cosets, each of 32 biorthogo-nal codewords. The geometric uniformity property is satisfied with the NR code, although it is not linear. Since the demodulator under consideration is noncoherent, only the orthogonal subcode of the NR code can be used. <p> TRELLIS CODED KERDOCK CODE OF LENGTH 64 The code we have been examined so far, the Nordstrom-Robinson code, is an example of the Kerdock codes of length 16 <ref> [3] </ref>. Now we wish to explore our study further to the Kerdock code of length 64, K 64 . K 64 is divided into 32 cosets, each composed of 128 biorthogonal codewords, with the minimum distance at 28. The geometric uniformity property is still satisfied with K 64 . <p> same bit error probability the signal-to-noise ratio needed is reduced for the trellis coded system by the factor G = k + l + 1 2 (2M 2) a (2M ) &gt;From the above, by finding the value of G, we may predict the performance of other Kerdock codes [1], <ref> [3] </ref> in trellis-coded version with noncoherent reception. For the case of length 64 Kerdock codes the gain is 4.60dB while for the case of length 256 Kerdock codes the gain is 4.93dB. Of course the gain is achieved with significantly more complex receivers.
