Title: Recent Activities in the MICE Conferencing Project  
Author: Peter T. Kirstein Mark Handley Angela Sasse Stuart Clayman 
Note: INET95 Proc. INET95 Kirstein, Handley, Sasse Clayman  
Abstract: The MICE project has been piloting multimedia conferencing (audio, video and shared workspace) over the Internet in Europe, with links to the US, over the last two years. In this paper, we summarise our experience and discuss recent developments in several areas: tool improvement, their use over ISDN and ATM, security, management and control, multimedia servers, new application areas and a recently created network of support centres.

Reference-contexts: There is now a suite of tools available in the public domain, offering users a choice of audio, video and shared workspace tools. The multicast backbone of the Internet (Mbone) <ref> [3] </ref> has grown over the past 2 years from about 200 sites to some 1500 sites today. In the process, it has become more organised, but also is starting to show some scaling problems.

Reference-contexts: Work is in progress in the IETF inter-domain multicast routing working group to address these problems. It is hoped that this work can be deployed before the Mbone starts to become unusable. 2.1 Transport The normal transport protocol for CCITT H.320 family teleconferencing applications is H.221 <ref> [4] </ref>. However, H.221 is unsuited to wide area internetworking for a number of reasons, including its total intolerance to packet loss.

Reference-contexts: We expect to address the issue of gateways between the two in a future project - but not in MICE. 2.2 Video For video, we have mainly used software codecs with three tools: nv <ref> [7] </ref> from Xerox, IVS [8] from INRIA and VIC [9] from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories (LBL). These support several video compression algorithms, but the principle one used in MICE is the CCITT H.261 standard [10].

Reference-contexts: These support several video compression algorithms, but the principle one used in MICE is the CCITT H.261 standard <ref> [10] </ref>. As workstations have become more powerful, and the video cards on the workstations have improved, these tools have improved in terms of the quality and frame rates that are achievable. In addition, some work has been done to make video more tolerant to packet loss.

Reference-contexts: In addition, most of these cards are not sufficiently flexible to produce intra-coded video without sending the entire picture with each frame, which is unnecessary and inappropriate. 2.3 Audio The most widely used audio tool for Mbone conferencing is vat <ref> [11] </ref>. Whilst vat has been constantly improved over the past two years, audio quality is still a problem in many conferences. Since insufficient audio quality is the most serious threat to the success of current multicast conferences, the MICE project has dedicated considerable resources to diagnosing and addressing audio problems.

Reference-contexts: MICE partners have therefore put effort into counteracting the effects of packet loss on audio quality. One of the approaches, in which packet loss is repaired at the receiving end is described in the paper by Hardman et. al. in this volume <ref> [12] </ref>. 2.4 Shared Workspace Many tools have been investigated for shared workspaces over the last couple of years. Tools for shared drawing have been developed by SICS (Multidraw) and INRIA (Mscrawl). These tools are not really ready for service use yet. <p> UCL has implemented the encryption for VIC and is doing so for its own audio tool BAT <ref> [12] </ref>. INRIA is providing similar facilities for IVS. To allow different keys lists per media to be easily distributed UCL is also adding encryption to the session announcements of the Session Directory.

Reference-contexts: Tools for shared drawing have been developed by SICS (Multidraw) and INRIA (Mscrawl). These tools are not really ready for service use yet. There is a good discussion of the comparison between the systems in a MICE deliverable <ref> [13] </ref>. The most commonly used joint working tool is still wb [14] also from LBL. Whilst it is still the best developed such tool, it is not optimal for all shared workspace tasks. The University of Oslo has been developing an electronic whiteboard to be used in distance learning.

Reference-contexts: Although several such shared editors have emerged from the CSCW community, they all suffer from scaling problems which restrict their usefullness. To address this, we have developed one such network text editor (nt) <ref> [15] </ref>, which allows scalable shared editing of the same document between Mbone sites. The systems use many different paradigms for the shared workspace, some of these scale as one moves to tens or hundreds of sites; some do not scale very well.

Reference-contexts: It is planned, with partial support from the European Commision under the auspices of the Telematics programme, to upgrade the European research network infrastructure. However this upgrade is not expected before 1996. In the UK, there are now 54 sites on SuperJanet's IP over SMDS service <ref> [16] </ref>, which performs extremely well for real-time traffic and Mbone usage. In contrast, the SuperJanet ATM pilot in the UK, which was started around the same time is still not really usable for this traffic, due to a combination of equipment performance and configuration and interoperability problems.

Reference-contexts: One of the systems is called class-based-queuing (CBQ) <ref> [17] </ref> - which was discussed at INET two years ago. This is being piloted on certain portions of the MBONE - particularly the link between the UK and the US.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, these workstations usually work only up to 128 Kbps - which gives rather poor quality facilities. The early work in interworking between the ISDN and Internet use for multimedia conferencing is discussed in <ref> [18] </ref>. Recently we have installed two types of equipment which has become available. The SparcStation workstations we use for much of our work now have ISDN interfaces which operate using the PPP protocol [19] at the transport level at 64 Kbps. However, this is not sufficient bandwidth for many conferences.

However, this is not sufficient bandwidth for many conferences. We have also installed primary rate IP over ISDN routers at a few sites; these operate at up to 2 Mbps (30 channels), and any number of channels can be bonded together.

Reference-contexts: There is much discussion in the MMUSIC group of the IETf and elsewhere about how such conference control should be implemented, but the Mbone community has not yet decided on a solution. The contribution from the MICE project in this area is the Conference Control Channel Protocol (CCCP, <ref> [20] </ref>), which is a multicast based foundation upon which detailed conference policy can be implemented. The area of meta-conference management (the advertising and creating of conferences) is also starting to undergo some changes. For the past two years, this has been done solely using the SD tool from LBL.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we are working on providing the infrastructure for key distribution. 5.1 Provision of Confidentiality. We have started introducing confidentiality into conferences through the use of encryption. We have retrofitted encryption using DES <ref> [21] </ref> on certain of the tools to which we have source code, using our own standards compliant encryption routines developed in the context of the PASSWORD project [22]. UCL has implemented the encryption for VIC and is doing so for its own audio tool BAT [12].

Reference-contexts: To ensure interoperability of conference tools with encryption it is vital that key transport and processing operations are accurately defined. UCL is publishing its exact encryption mechanisms in the IETF <ref> [23] </ref>. This will be published more widely, after the UCL proposals have been agreed in the IETF arena. We appreciate this is not a very satisfactory method of achieving interoperability or of producing common tools.

Reference-contexts: The keys are then returned to those who have both requested the key and been so authorised by PEM/MIME or Secure HTTP <ref> [26] </ref>. For all the above, it is necessary to send some information securely to authorised participants. These participants can either have circulated their public keys to conference organisers, or may list them in a publicly available directory. We intend to start using secured conferencing prior to INET.

Running successful seminars still requires considerable resources and effort, as well as suitably equipped conference rooms. <p> This is in lieu of full echo cancellation in the conference rooms, which is often impossible. Video is usually transmitted from the speaker's site and one or two remote audiences in conference rooms. Full details of the seminars and our experiences with them is given in <ref> [28] </ref>. Since the time of that paper, several of the MICE participants have redesigned the audio environment and their lighting in the conference rooms to counteract problems observed.

Reference-contexts: Medical Workshop The MICE project demonstrated the potential of multicast conferencing to the medical community by showing two live operations (one each from the Sahlgrenska Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden and the UCSF Hospital in San Francisco, US) during a workshop on minimally invasive surgery in London on November 11, 1994 <ref> [29] </ref>. In addition, live video was transmitted from approximately twelve operations and the workshop itself in London to a small audience in Gothenburg.

Reference-contexts: In should also be noted that this is an area where privacy and hence security is essential, and so encryption should be used to ensure confidentiality. 8.3 The ArtAids Application We have used the technology in an interactive art application <ref> [30] </ref>. In that activity, the picture themselves are put on a video server, and artists, art students, or the public can browse the collection. In the official opening of the project, the artists from London, Melbourne, Stuttgart, Stockholm and Sydney.
