Abstract: For registration of 3-D free-form surfaces we have developed a representation which requires no knowledge of the transformation between views. The representation comprises descriptive images associated with oriented points on the surface of an object. Constructed using single point bases, these images are data level shape descriptions that are used for efficient matching of oriented points. Correlation of images is used to establish point correspondences between two views; from these correspondences a rigid transformation that aligns the views is calculated. The transformation is then refined and verified using a modified iterative closest point algorithm. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we present results from multiple sensing domains.

Reference-contexts: Our verification algorithm is a formulation of the iterative closest point algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>[13] that can handle partially overlapping point sets and arbitrary transformations between model and scene because it is initialized with a transformation generated from independently determined point correspondences. This is in contrast to traditional ICP [1] which requires an initial guess of the transformation between model and scene and assumes that one point set is a proper subset of the other.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to registration is similar to others in that we use correspondences between low-level surface parameters to calculate rigid transformations that align views using no prior knowledge about the transformation between views. Chua and Jarvis <ref> [3] </ref> present an algorithm for matching 3-D free-form surfaces by matching points based on principal curvatures. <p> If surface normal, which can be computed reliably, is chosen as one of the axes, then two axes in the tangent plane of the surface must be determined to complete the basis. An obvious choice for these axes would be the directions of principal curvature on the surface <ref> [3] </ref> which, when combined with the surface normal, create the Darboux frame of the surface. However, determination of the directions of principal curvature of a surface require the computation of second-order surface derivatives, so the resulting axes are very susceptible to noise.

Reference-contexts: The end result is a disjoint partition of the correspondences where, in general, correspondences with high similarity measure are grouped together.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, a spin-image computed at any point on a surface is discriminating, so the need for extraction of salient features is eliminated. Although spin-images can also be used in object recognition <ref> [7] </ref>, the focus of this paper is on 3-D surface registration. Our approach to registration is similar to others in that we use correspondences between low-level surface parameters to calculate rigid transformations that align views using no prior knowledge about the transformation between views. <p> We measure surface mesh resolution as the median of edge lengths in the mesh. In general, objects imaged with the same sensor will have the same resolution. In cases where the density of points is different, we use a mesh simplification algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> to add and remove points from the surface meshes until the densities are the same.

Reference-contexts: The surface meshes were created by adding small amounts of Gaussian noise to the points in the original surface mesh generated from the CT scans and then simplifying the meshes <ref> [8] </ref>. Different random noise values were added to the original surface mesh for each of the meshes shown, resulting in surface meshes with different points and connectivity after simplification.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, dependence on computation of second order surface derivatives makes it difficult to robustly compute principal curvatures on surfaces.

To create a spin-image, a local 2-D basis is computed at an oriented point (3-D points with surface normal) on the surface. <p> Our initial idea was to use all of the points on the surface of an object in a geometric hashing algorithm. Unfortunately, constructing coordinate systems from all tuples of points would lead to a combinatoric explosion in the indexing <ref> [10] </ref> (given the large number of points on the surface). Furthermore, coordinate systems constructed from tuples of points are very sensitive to the position of points sensed on the surface.
