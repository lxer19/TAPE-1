Abstract: The control feel of the master controller in a telemanipulation system has a critical effect on human-machine system performance. Many theoretical and practical human factors issues on hand controller design and selection remain to be explored. In this paper, two types of hand controllers, elastic versus isometric rate controllers, were studied in a 6 degree-of-freedom pursuit tracking experiment. 26 subjects participated in the experiment. The results showed that the elastic rate controller facilitated significantly lower tracking error than the isometric rate controller, presumably due to richer proprioceptive feedback afforded by the elastic device. It was also found that, although the elastic controller was superior to the isometric controller in general, the magnitude of performance differences between the two controllers decreased as subjects gained more experience, supporting the theory that human manipulation shifts from more closed-loop behaviour towards open loop skills.

Reference-contexts: One indication of this is that the tracking error in the Z direction was much closer to the X and Y direction errors, in comparison with analogous data reported by others <ref> (Massimino et al, 1989) </ref>.

These include frequency domain analysis, the effect of the target Z axis location on manipulation performance, and more detailed research on performance differences between different controller degrees-of-freedom. 7.

The MITS system automatically records information during the experiment, including time stamps, subjects' control actions in each DOF, target transformation matrices, The authors can provide this software to parties interested in using it for related research. <p> In order to make the target path sufficiently unpredictable to the experimental subjects, each forcing function was derived from a weighted summation of 20 sine waves, which were similar to the summation used by Tachi & Yasuda (1993), but more complex than the conventional sum-of-sines method <ref> (e.g. Poulton, 1974) </ref>. Appendix A describes the derivation of forcing function for each DOF and the control of target and cursor motion. Target Cursor 2.4. <p> Mathematically, this measure converts rotation to equivalent translational distance. For each trial (40 seconds, 800 tracking steps) overall tracking performance was calculated by root mean square (RMS) error, as conventionally accepted in the literature <ref> (Poulton, 1974) </ref>: RMS error = e k N (2) Imaginary tetrahedron (dashed line) in the centre of the actual cursor (solid line).
