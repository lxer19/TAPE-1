Our setting is based on an approach suggested by El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [4] </ref> in which competitive analysis is used to study the performance of financial trading strategies without relying on stochastic assumptions. Competitive analysis is a technique that has been developed and used in computer science research in which the performance of a strategy is measured relative to some benchmark strategy. <p> Notice that the weight ff is in some sense a general forecast of the future behaviour of the adversary. 2.3 Competitive Analysis of Financial Trading Strategies In <ref> [4] </ref> El-Yaniv et al. apply competitive analysis to the problem of trading financial instruments. We now briefly summarize their major results. They begin with the unidirectional conversion 7 problem, in which an online investor wants to convert a fixed amount of dollars to yen over a fixed period of time. <p> In the bidirectional problem, the investor may trade dollars for yen and yen for dollars, and the performance of an algorithm is the return 1 of the algorithm. 2.3.1 Unidirectional Trading Our formulation of the unidirectional trading problem is slightly more general than in <ref> [4] </ref>, which simplifies the analysis. Consider an (online) investor who starts with d 0 US dollars, all of which he wishes to convert to Japanese yen according to the following rules: 1. There are n trading periods T i , where i = 1; : : : ; n. 2. <p> Lemma 2.1 means that the general unidirectional trading problem is not interesting, because reasonably low competitive ratios are not possible. To continue we need to make some 9 assumptions about the exchange rate. One of the scenarios that El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [4] </ref> consider is that the exchange rate is bounded, m e i M , for i = 1; : : : ; n, and that the online investor knows the bounds m; M . Will will adopt this assumption. <p> Will will adopt this assumption. This gives us the added constraint 3. 8i; m e i M 2.3.2 An Optimal Online Algorithm El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [4] </ref> show that when the exchange rate is bounded, there exists a finite optimal competitive ratio, and present an optimal online algorithm. In this section we will present this algorithm. <p> investor can take advantage if offered an exchange rate e i 6= e i by starting a new game, recomputing the new minimum achievable competitive ratio, and running TS1 with the new parameters. 2.4 Other Trading Scenarios We now describe some of the other trading scenarios considered in [3] and <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.4.1 Bidirectional Trading In the bidirectional trading problem, the investor may convert dollars to yen and yen to dollars. For this problem, the performance of the algorithm is its return (which will be the same, regardless of which currency it is measured in). <p> If the number of maxima and minima is bounded by k, then the competitive ratio has an upper bound of (r ? ) k and a lower bound of (r ? ) k=2 . 2.4.2 Trading with Options The paper <ref> [4] </ref> also considers the case of trading call options. A trader starts with d 0 dollars, and receives a sequence of call option offers of the form (x i ; c i ). <p> One of the issues involved here is which strategies currently used by traders can and should be included for comparison. 6.2.3 An Analysis of Hedging using Options El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [4] </ref> analyze the problem of trading an option by simply regarding an option as an isolated financial security (see Section 2.4.2). They do not fully consider the interaction between the options market and the associated cash market. <p> giving the trader the obligation to convert s i dollars to x i s i yen at the rate x i if the final exchange rate e n &gt; x i . 6.2.4 Bidirectional Trading In Section 3.2, we showed that the unidirectional trading problem was "easy." El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [4] </ref> show that the bidirectional problem is hard (see Section 2.4.1): the competitive ratio is exponential in the number of local maxima and minima exchange rates. We propose to study this problem to see if the risk-reward framework allows us to derive meaningful results.

Reference-contexts: j = max ij e i then the maximum exchange rate is U n , and so the online investor wishes to minimize the competitive ratio r = sup d 0 U n i=1 s i e i subject to the constraints: 1. 8i; s i 0 P n In <ref> [5] </ref>, El-Yaniv et al. show that if the exchange rate and the number of trading periods is unbounded, then the optimal competitive ratio is unbounded. In the following Lemma, we generalize this result. <p> The worst case exchange rate E = fe 1 ; e 2 ; : : : ; e n g as constructed by El-Yaniv et al. <ref> [5] </ref> is as follows: 1. Set e 0 = mr ? 2. Set e 1 to the root of the equation M m n1 m (n 1) 3.

Reference-contexts: There exist problems for which the optimal competitive ratio is not finite, or very large. For such cases, competitive analysis is of little value. The highest valued benefit that must be sacrificed because an investor chooses an investment strategy is the opportunity cost of the choice <ref> [7] </ref>. Opportunity cost is a well known measure, used to differentiate between economic alternatives. From a financial standpoint, the competitive ratio of an algorithm is a measure of the opportunity cost of the algorithm, since the return of OPT is always the highest possible benefit.

Reference-contexts: One method to make up for the lack of this knowledge is to model future events using a stochastic model. Analysis of historical data usually provides estimates for the parameters of the model. Investment decisions are then based on properties that can be calculated from the model <ref> [8] </ref>. Often the most important goal is maximizing the expected return, but in many situations properties such as the variance of the return or the probability of ruin are also considered.

Reference-contexts: The Hurwicz Criterion <ref> [9] </ref>, as referred to in [11], is a weighted average of the pessimistic case (minimizing the maximum performance ratio, or "nature will always do its worst") and the optimistic case (minimizing the minimum performance ratio, or "nature will always do its best").

Reference-contexts: An o*ine trading algorithm can always maximize the return of the investor. Competitive analysis is a method by which the performance of an online algorithm is measured relative to the performance of the optimal o*ine algorithm [17]. We now summarize competitive analysis, following <ref> [10] </ref> and [13]. Let A be an algorithm that solves an optimization problem. For each such problem there is an associated performance function which measures the quality of a solution for a given input.

Reference-contexts: The 19 definition we will follow is that of risk as the "exposure to a chance of loss" <ref> [12] </ref>. There are three components to this definition: * Magnitude of Loss: There has to be a potential loss of some amount. <p> MacCrimmon and Wehrung <ref> [12] </ref> introduce a basic risk paradigm as the basis for studying risk. In their model there are two actions: a riskless action that leads to a certain outcome, and a risky action that leads to one of two outcomes; one is a gain, the other is a loss.

Reference-contexts: They attempt to remedy this situation by introducing Ragahavan's statistical 12 adversary <ref> [14] </ref>. A statistical adversary is one who must generate exchange rates satifying a certain statistical property (e.g. one could pick an adversary who is constrained to generating a sequence that has a given mean). In essence, the statistical restrictions on the adversary amounts to what we call a forecast.

Reference-contexts: We end the chapter with an analysis of a simple example online problem, giving both the traditonal analysis as well as one in our risk-reward framework. 4.1 What is Risk? In this section we give a brief introduction to the concepts, perceptions, measurement and management of risk as discussed in <ref> [19] </ref>. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (1982) defines the noun risk as "hazard, chance of bad consequences, loss, etc., exposure to mischance..." and the Webster's Dictionary (1981) definition is "possibility of loss or injury".
