Abstract: Multiple description coding (MDC) is source coding for multiple channels such that a decoder which receives an arbitrary subset of the channels may produce a useful reconstruction. Orchard et al. [1] proposed a transform coding method for MDC of pairs of independent Gaussian random variables. This paper provides a general framework which extends multiple description transform coding (MDTC) to any number of variables and expands the set of transforms which are considered. Analysis of the general case is provided, which can be used to numerically design optimal MDTC systems. The case of two variables sent over two channels is analytically optimized in the most general setting where channel failures need not have equal probability or be independent. It is shown that when channel failures are equally probable and independent, the transforms used in [1] are in the optimal set, but many other choices are possible. A cascade structure is presented which facilitates low-complexity design, coding, and decoding for a system with a large number of variables.

Reference-contexts: The estimate ^x is then generated by inverting the transform as before. Starting with a linear transform T with determinant one, the first step in deriving a discrete version ^ T is to factor T into "lifting" steps <ref> [8] </ref>. This means that T is factored into a product of upper and lower triangular matrices with unit diagonals T = T 1 T 2 T k .

Reference-contexts: If we were to apply a (continuous) transform first and then quantize, the use of a nonorthogonal transform would lead to noncubic partition cells, which are inherently suboptimal among the class of partition cells obtainable with scalar quantization <ref> [9] </ref>. The present configuration allows one to use discrete transforms derived from nonorthogonal linear transforms, and thus obtain better performance [1]. 3 Analysis of an MDTC System The analysis and optimizations presented in this paper are based on fine quantization approximations.
