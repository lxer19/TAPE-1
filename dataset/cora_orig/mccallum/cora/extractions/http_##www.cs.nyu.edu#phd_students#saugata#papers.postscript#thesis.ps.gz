Reference-contexts: special case we can consider D to be the integers, and R the field of real numbers.) We define the complexity of an algorithm to be the number of arithmetic operations (additions, multiplications and comparisons) it requires in the domain D. 9 Let the variables be divided into blocks X <ref> [1] </ref> ; : : : ; X [!] ; where the i th block is of length k i : We are also given a first order formula of the form, Q ! (X [!] )Q !1 (X [!1] ) : : : Q 1 (X [1] )F (P 1 ; <p> divided into blocks X <ref> [1] </ref> ; : : : ; X [!] ; where the i th block is of length k i : We are also given a first order formula of the form, Q ! (X [!] )Q !1 (X [!1] ) : : : Q 1 (X [1] )F (P 1 ; : : : ; P s ); where, Q i 2 f8; 9g; Q i 6= Q i+1 ; X [i] is a block of k i variables, P and F (P 1 ; : : : P s ) is a quantifier-free Boolean formula, with <p> 2 f8; 9g; Q i 6= Q i+1 ; X [i] is a block of k i variables, P and F (P 1 ; : : : P s ) is a quantifier-free Boolean formula, with atoms of the form P i (X [!] ; : : : ; X <ref> [1] </ref> ) j 0, where j 2 f&gt;; &lt;; =g: The problem again is to decide the truth or falsity of the given formula. Note that, if ! = 1, this problem is called the decision problem for the existential theory of reals. <p> The degrees of the polynomials are again bounded by d, and the coefficients drawn from an ordered domain D, as in the previous problems. We are given a first-order formula of the form, (Q ! X [!] ) : : : (Q 1 X <ref> [1] </ref> )F (P 1 ; : : : ; P s ); (henceforth, denoted by (Y )) where, Q i 2 f8; 9g; Q i 6= Q i+1 , Y = (Y 1 ; : : : ; Y l ) is a block of l free variables, X [i] is <p> block of l free variables, X [i] is a block of k i variables, P and F (P 1 ; : : : ; P s ) is a quantifer free Boolean formula, with atomic predicates of the form, P i (Y; X [!] ; : : : ; X <ref> [1] </ref> ) j 0; 1 i s; where j 2 f&gt;; &lt;; =g . 10 The quantifier elimination problem is to construct a quantifier free Boolean formula, (Y ), such that y 2 R l satisfies the given formula (Y ), if and only if (y) is true. <p> The semi-algebraically connected components of S K are the extensions to K of the semi-algebraically connected components of S. * Given a point x belonging to the closure of a semi-algebraic set S R k , there exists a semi-algebraic function from <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to R k with (0) = x, (]0; 1]) S (this is the curve selection lemma). <p> by P 1 = = P ` = P i 1 = = P i m = 0; which contains p: We claim that C 0 C: Suppose that there exists a point q 2 C 0 such that q 62 C: Then there exists a semi-algebraic path fl : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C 0 joining p to q in C 0 : Denote by q 0 the first point of the path fl on the 26 boundary of C: More precisely, pick t 2 [0; 1] such that fl ([0; t]) C and 8t 0 &gt; t; fl ([0; t <p> C 0 such that q 62 C: Then there exists a semi-algebraic path fl : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C 0 joining p to q in C 0 : Denote by q 0 the first point of the path fl on the 26 boundary of C: More precisely, pick t 2 [0; 1] such that fl ([0; t]) C and 8t 0 &gt; t; fl ([0; t 0 ]) 6 C, then we take q 0 = fl (t). <p> Conversely, let x be in T " Z (X k+1 ). The semi-algebraic curve selection lemma [15] asserts the existence of a semi-algebraic function f from <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to T with f (0) = x and f ((0; 1]) T . This semi-algebraic function defines a point z whose coordinates lie in Rh*i and belongs to S 0 and moreover eval * (z) = x. <p> by eval to y. 2 The set of critical points so obtained after perturbation is finite and we will need to solve the system Q 1 = @X 2 @Q 1 = 0; in order to compute these critical points. 3.2 Solving Polynomial Systems In this section we closely follow <ref> [1] </ref>. This method for solving polynomial systems is very much inspired by the way Canny [18] and Renegar [55] use the u-resultant of a system of k polynomials in k variables [65] but gives a more direct approach. <p> Later we will see how to find such a u: We now describe the method in <ref> [1] </ref> for solving systems of polynomial equations. Let (u; t) be the characteristic polynomial of the linear transformation, L u . <p> We follow the same steps as in the Cell Representatives Subroutine, and compute parametrized univariate representations which consists of tuples of polynomials in D <ref> [Y; ; ; 1 ] </ref>[t], by calling the Univariate Representation Subroutine. Note, that the Univariate Representation Subroutine is completely uniform, and hence works equally well in the parametrized case. <p> the Sign Determination Subroutine. 92 Computation of SIGN (P) The input is a set of s polynomials, P = fP 1 ; : : :; P s g D [X 1 ; : : : ; X k ], and a partition, ; of the variables into ! blocks, X <ref> [1] </ref> ; : : : ; X [!] . The output is SIGN (P): We denote by X [i] the variables (X [!] ; : : : ; X [i] ). The algorithm consists of three phases: the Elimination Phase, the Substitution Phase and the Sign Determination Phase. <p> u = (u 1 ; : : : ; u ! ) 2 U = Q define the associated triangular system and the associated list of polynomials, T u and P u , as follows; Let [i] [i] For a polynomial P (X [!] ; : : : ; X <ref> [1] </ref> ), let P u (t 1 ; : : : ; t ! ) denote the polyno mial obtained by successively substituting the blocks of variables X [i] , by the 93 rational fractions associated with the tuple u i . <p> The algorithm is as follows: * Elimination Phase: We first apply the Block Elimination Subroutine to P and the first block of variables X <ref> [1] </ref> . Let U 1 , and Q 1 be the output of the Block Elimination Subroutine. 94 Repeat the following for i = 2 to !. <p> Let Z be the set of such points obtained by considering all such triangular systems T u and all their real zeros. Lemma 10 The set Z i = fx i j x = (x <ref> [1] </ref> ; : : : ; x [!] ) 2 Zg intersects every cell of Q i ; where x i = (x [i+1] ; : : : ; x [!] ): Proof: The proof is again by induction on i. <p> The general decision problem can now be solved easily using the set SIGN (P) without using any additional arithmetic operations. 98 The General Decision Algorithm The input is a formula Q ! (X [!] )Q !1 (X [!1] ) : : : Q 1 (X <ref> [1] </ref> )F (P 1 ; : : : ; P s ); where, Q i 2 f8; 9g; Q i 6= Q i+1 ; X [i] is a block of k i variables, P k; and F (P 1 ; : : :P s ) is a quantifier-free Boolean formula with <p> i 2 f8; 9g; Q i 6= Q i+1 ; X [i] is a block of k i variables, P k; and F (P 1 ; : : :P s ) is a quantifier-free Boolean formula with atoms of the form P i (X [!] ; : : :; X <ref> [1] </ref> ) 0, where 2 f0; 1; 1g and the output is 0 or 1 depending on whether the input sentence is true or false. The algorithm simply computes SIGN (P) and then checks whether or not the formula is satisfied. <p> Given a triangular system of polynomials, T = fT [!] (Y; t ! ); T [!1] (Y; t ! ; t !1 ); T <ref> [1] </ref> (Y; t ! ; t !1 ; : : : ; t 1 ); 0); a set of polynomials P R [Y; t 1 ; : : : ; t ! ], a point y 2 R ` , we denote by (T; P; y) the list of sign conditions <p> We now give a formal description of the algorithm, and prove the bounds on the time complexity, and the size of the output formula. The input is a first order formula (Y ) = Q ! (X [!] )Q !1 (X [!1] ) : : :Q 1 (X <ref> [1] </ref> )F (P 1 ; : : : ; P s ) and the output a quantifier free formula (Y ) equivalent to (Y ). The algorithm follows: Read the formula (Y ) and output the list of polynomials P.

A similar algorithm is implicit in Canny [18] and Renegar [55]. We follow the algorithm given in <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> We describe an algorithm which solves the problem when the vaiety is described by transversal polynomials. This algorithm is essentially Algorithm B in <ref> [8] </ref>.

The input to the algorithm is Q and a set P of s polynomials. <p> It is clear that Z = Z (Q 1 ) " B (0; R) satisfies the other hypotheses of Proposition 27 (see Proposition 2 in <ref> [9] </ref>). Moreover, the set of distinguished values V contains all the pseudo-critical values with respect to Z (see Step 5 of the algorithm). <p> Step 4 Again it is clear that this step requires no more than d O (k) arithmetic operations in the ring D; using the bound on the algorithm for deciding the existential theory of the reals in <ref> [9] </ref>. done in polynomial time and the size of the input is d O (k) . Step 5 The complexity of this step is again d O (k) arithmetic operations in the ring D . <p> all i 2 f1; : : :; sg n J; P i is strictly positive at p; and hence is positive at q; because q is in an infintesimal neighbourhood of p: But this means that q 2 S n fpg " B p (*): Using the sample points subroutine <ref> [9] </ref> with the polynomials defining (S J n fpg) " B * " 1 (1; (p)) as input, we find a point p i (*) in every semi-algebraically connected component of (S (p) n fpg) " B * " 1 (1; (p)): Moreover, eval * (p i ) = p. <p> This is the cost of calling the sample points subroutine on a set of 5s polynomials, with degrees bounded by d; and computing their images under the eval * 0 map. From the bound on the sample points subroutine in <ref> [9] </ref> we conclude that this step has a complexity of s k+1 d O (k) : Moreover, the size of the set V is bounded by s k d O (k) : For 0 j &lt; k; we have O (s) calls to the algorithm described in the previous section, with <p> Thus the total complexity of this algorithm is bounded by (ksd) O (k) : 177 9.5.2 The case of a general semi-algebraic set Description of the Algorithm Using the algorithm in <ref> [9] </ref> list all non-empty sign conditions, 1 ; : : : ; m of the family P; such that the set S j defined by j is contained in S for 1 j m: For each j; 1 j m; do the following.

We give algorithms which improve the complexity of Renegar's algorithms for these problems. Moreover, our techniques allow us to prove some purely mathematical theorems on the number of connected components <ref> [10] </ref>, and on the existence of small rational points in a given semi-algebraic set [9]. These have applications in theoretical computer science [42]. <p> This result generalizes the Oleinik-Petrovsky-Thom-Milnor bound in two different directions (see next subsection 1.2.3). It also generalizes our result in <ref> [10] </ref> on the number of connected components, which is just the zero-th Betti number. Using the ideas behind this result, we give the first singly exponential algorithm for computing the Euler characteristic of an arbitrary semi-algebraic set. <p> The General Decision Problem and Quantifier Elimination We have applied our techniques to improve the previously fastest algorithms, due to Renegar [55], for the decision problem for the first order theory of reals, and for performing quantifier elimination in the first order theory of reals <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. We give below a brief description of these problems, their history and our results. <p> Firstly, our bound applies to arbitrary unions of basic semi-algebraic sets, not just for basic semi-algebraic sets. Secondly, the combinatorial part (the part depending on s) in our bound, depends on the dimension of the variety rather than that of the ambient space. It also generalizes a result in <ref> [10] </ref> where a similar bound is proven for the number of connected components. In order to achieve these bounds we prove that an arbitrary closed semi-algebraic set has the same homology groups as a compact semi-algebraic set defined by polynomials in general position. <p> Finally in chapter 9 we discuss our new bounds on the sum of the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets and computing their Euler characteristic.

Reference-contexts: The non- archimedean extensions of R that we will be considering are the fields of Puiseux series in some infinitesimals with coefficients in R. We give 19 the definition and some relevant properties of these fields and refer the reader to <ref> [15] </ref> for more details. <p> The initial term of a non-zero Puiseux series, P i i 0 q and its valuation is i 0 q . The unique order on Rh*i is defined by P i element * of Rh*i is infinitesimal positive with respect to R. The field Rh*i is real closed <ref> [15] </ref> and the field R [i]h*i is algebraically closed [66]. <p> A full discussion of these can be found in <ref> [15] </ref> but we offer a brief summary below. 22 The order relation on a real closed field R defines, as usual, the euclidean topology on R k . <p> Semi-algebraic sets are finite unions of sets defined by a finite number of polynomial equalities and inequalities, and semi-algebraic homeomorphisms are homeomorphisms whose graph is semi-algebraic. In particular, we have the following elementary properties of semi-algebraic sets over a real closed field R (see also <ref> [15] </ref>) * The projection of a semi-algebraic set of R k+` on R k is semi-algebraic. <p> Since (z; *) belongs to the extension of B x (r) " T to Rh*i it follows that B x (r) " T is non-empty, and hence that x 2 T . Conversely, let x be in T " Z (X k+1 ). The semi-algebraic curve selection lemma <ref> [15] </ref> asserts the existence of a semi-algebraic function f from [0; 1] to T with f (0) = x and f ((0; 1]) T . This semi-algebraic function defines a point z whose coordinates lie in Rh*i and belongs to S 0 and moreover eval * (z) = x.

In the following years there have been steady improvements due to Grigor'ev and Vorobjov [33, 32], Heintz, 4 Roy and Solerno <ref> [37] </ref>, and Renegar [55]. Renegar's algorithms were the best algorithms for these problems prior to my work. We give algorithms which improve the complexity of Renegar's algorithms for these problems. <p> In 1987, John Canny [17] introduced the notion of a roadmap of a semi-algebraic set.

In such an application, it is obviously desirable that the complexity of our algorithm depend on the dimension of the variety, rather than on the dimension of the ambient space. An application of the bound on the number of cells, is in the area of geometric transversal theory.

Reference-contexts: The third part of this work [12] deals with bounding the topological complexity of semi-algebraic sets in terms of the number and the degrees of the 5 polynomials describing it. We extend and improve a classical and widely used result of Oleinik and Petrovsky [50] (1949), Thom <ref> [64] </ref> (1965) and Mil-nor [47](1965), bounding the sum of the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets. This result generalizes the Oleinik-Petrovsky-Thom-Milnor bound in two different directions (see next subsection 1.2.3). It also generalizes our result in [10] on the number of connected components, which is just the zero-th Betti number. <p> This extends a well-known bound due to Oleinik and Petrovsky [50], Thom <ref> [64] </ref> and Milnor [47]. <p> closed semi-algebraic set defined by, P 1 0; : : :; P s 0; with deg (P i ) d; there is a tighter bound of (O (sd)) k on the sum of the Betti numbers of S: This was proved in separate papers by Oleinik and Petrovsky [50], Thom <ref> [64] </ref> and Milnor [47]. (Note that this includes the case when S is the real zeros of a set of polynomials.) This bound plays an important role in algorithmic real algebraic geometry [40], and has been used recently in proving lower bounds in the algebraic computation tree model (see [67], [51]).

Reference-contexts: This method for solving polynomial systems is very much inspired by the way Canny [18] and Renegar [55] use the u-resultant of a system of k polynomials in k variables <ref> [65] </ref> but gives a more direct approach. Let K be a field of characteristic zero and K an algebraically closed field containing it. Let I = (P 1 ; ; P s ) be an ideal and A = K [X 1 ; ; X k ]=I.

This bound plays an important role in algorithmic real algebraic geometry [40], and has been used recently in proving lower bounds in the algebraic computation tree model (see <ref> [67] </ref>, [51]). A difficulty in extending this bound to an arbitrary semi-algebraic set defined by the polynomials P; lies in the fact that the Betti numbers of the union of two disjoint sets, might be much greater than the sum of the individual Betti numbers of the two sets (see [67] <p> <ref> [67] </ref>, [51]). A difficulty in extending this bound to an arbitrary semi-algebraic set defined by the polynomials P; lies in the fact that the Betti numbers of the union of two disjoint sets, might be much greater than the sum of the individual Betti numbers of the two sets (see [67] for an easy example). We extend the same bound to arbitrary unions of basic closed semi-algebraic sets. <p> Grassmannian G m;n (the space of m dimensional subspaces of R n ), embedded as a m (n m) dimensional variety in R n 2 : Remark: We note that a bound of (O (sd)) 2k on the sum of the Betti numbers can be deduced from Theorem 1 in <ref> [67] </ref> or from Theorem 1.10 in 151 [51]. In order to achieve the bound in theorem 6 we prove that an arbitrary closed semi-algebraic set has the same homology groups as a compact semi-algebraic set defined by polynomials in general position. <p> We utilize several results from <ref> [67] </ref>. We assume that the reader is familiar with algebraic decision trees ([67]). <p> For any set A; following <ref> [67] </ref>, we define fi 0 i (A) to be the rank of the i-th homology group H i ( A; @A); where A is the closure of A in the topology of R k and @A = A A: Similarly we define, 0 (A) = P i (A): If A is <p> For some polynomial f 2 R [X 1 ; : : :; X k ]; let A = X " (f 0); and B = X A: Then, 0 (X) = 0 (A) + 0 (B): Proof: The proof is quite similar to the proof of lemma 5 in <ref> [67] </ref>. <p> [ @X; @X) ! H i ( X; @X) ! H i ( X; A [ @X) ! ; we have ( X; @X) = ( X; A [ @X) + ( A [ @X; @X): Moreover, fi i ( X; A [ @X) = fi 0 i (A) (see <ref> [67] </ref> for a proof). <p> omit the details. 2 We next prove that, following the notation introduced in the algorithm, that fi 0 i (S j ) = fi i (U j ; V j ); and thus 0 (S j ) = (U j ; V j ): The proof of this appears in <ref> [67] </ref> (page 621) and is omitted.
