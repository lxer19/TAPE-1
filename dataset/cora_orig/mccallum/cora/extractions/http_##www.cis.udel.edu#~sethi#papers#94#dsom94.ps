Reference-contexts: The need for efficient management of networks of varying sizes and types has led to standardization efforts in the Internet and OSI communities. These efforts led to the Internet and OSI models of network management <ref> [IS191a, CFSD90] </ref>. These two models are somewhat similar at the architectural level but the differences are significant at the functional level. For instance, the Internet Management model supports a flat MIB [RM90] whereas the OSI model supports an object-oriented information framework [IS191b].

Reference-contexts: This behavior is achieved while continuing to function completely within the domain of the Internet Management framework and without any modifications to the SNMP (or SNMPv2 <ref> [CMRW93] </ref>) protocol. The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 justifies the need for such a paradigm and the reasons for selecting the spreadsheet abstraction.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical event building allows a user to specify simple events (in cells) (Figure 3) and use those events to build subsequent events. In order to support event definitions in a flexible and easy way, an event specification language is required <ref> [Hol89] </ref>. To facilitate event definitions, a language or any other method chosen must provide arithmetic, logical, conditional, iterative and temporal expressions. Of these only the temporal expressions need further description. A temporal expression adds time as a dimension to the event specification [Hol89]. <p> easy way, an event specification language is required <ref> [Hol89] </ref>.

Of these only the temporal expressions need further description. A temporal expression adds time as a dimension to the event specification [Hol89]. In order to perform 5 management functions properly, a user should be able to specify (at least) the following temporal expressions: before event: This expression allows a user to specify occurrence of an event at a time instance before the occurrence of another event, but not necessarily immediately before.

The OSI model for management objects is more powerful and expressive than its Internet counterpart. However, the Internet model scores in terms of its simplicity and pragmatic approach.

Reference-contexts: In addition, for event definitions and object relationships to be available for use by a manager, they must be pre-defined in the MIBs supported by an agent. Some MIBs (such as the RMON MIB <ref> [Wal91] </ref>) allow the manager to choose the objects that will enter into a relationship (e.g., choosing the interface whose statistics are to be observed), but the nature of the relationships is built into the MIB table structures and cannot be modified by the manager.
