Abstract: Technical Report ECS-CSG-19-96 Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3JZ Abstract This report will present a procedure for assessing the degree of visual detail which a user can perceive in an arbitrary computer-generated image. This will involve describing an image in terms of its component spatial frequencies (c/deg); a measure which is commonly employed in the field of visual perception to characterise the efficacy of the human visual system. The text will present a brief introduction to this visual metric, and then demonstrate how a full-colour computer-generated image can be described in terms of this metric. The approach advocated here is based upon an image segmentation algorithm: Fourier techniques will be considered, and shown to be inappropriate for this particular application.

They state that 3 JNDs represent a significant perceptual difference (and that 10 JNDs produce a substantial discrepancy).

This transformation is normally represented mathematically as F (u; v) = F ff (x; y)g, where f (x; y) represents the spatial domain of the original image and F (u; v) represents the frequency domain of the Fourier transformed result.

Reference-contexts: The more common method is to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which drastically reduces the complexity of the DFT calculation <ref> (Brigham, 1974) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the first instance, Campbell and Robson showed how contrast gratings other than sine-wave gratings can be related to the simple harmonic case. In their work, they showed that the visibility of a square-wave distribution is simply related to that of a sine-wave grating <ref> (Campbell & Robson, 1968) </ref>. This relationship breaks down for lower spatial frequencies, but as we are mostly concerned with the high spatial frequencies in an image (i.e. 3 square-wave gratings, b) complex gratings, and c) 2D gratings? high detail) this will not affect us to any great degree.

Reference-contexts: In this fashion, it has been found that a user's visual acuity varies in relation to the orientation of a contrast grating <ref> (Campbell et al., 1966) </ref>, its velocity across the retina (Kelly, 1979) and the degree to which it is placed in the user's peripheral field (Rovamo & Virsu, 1979). All of these effects can be modelled in terms of contrast and spatial frequency.

Reference-contexts: Therefore this intermediate scaling must also be taken into consideration when performing gamma correction. It should be noted that in order to obtain an accurate value for gamma, a light meter should be used to sample the intensity profile for the particular display device <ref> (Cowan, 1983) </ref>. 3.2.3 Viewing Condition Issues There are a number of factors which can affect the appearance of colours on a computer graphics display (MacDonald et al., 1990; Meyer & Greenberg, 1980).

Reference-contexts: a mechanism to describe a computer-generated image in terms of spatial frequency, it would be beneficial to briefly highlight some of the possible applications of this endeavour. 15 It is well known that the complexity of a geometric model affects the speed at which it can be processed and displayed <ref> (Deering, 1994) </ref>. In general, a more geometrically complex model implies a more visually complex model. So in a real-time graphics system, it becomes necessary to find the optimal amount of detail to render at any juncture.

Reference-contexts: However, many contemporary graphics renderers offer far more sophisticated display algorithms than just flat-shading. For example, polygons can often be smooth-shaded (nor 5 mally using Gouraud or Phong interpolation), anti-aliased and/or texture mapped <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref>. We should therefore be able to cope with these more realistic representations in addition to the simple case of flat-shaded primitives.

Reference-contexts: This has seen a progression from simple, bland wireframe figures to full-colour, solid, shaded and textured representations. With the advent of these more accurate rendering models, the ability to quantify the perceptual quality of a computer-generated image has become increasingly desirable <ref> (Funkhouser & Sequin, 1993) </ref>. That is, to analyse the degree of visual detail which the user can perceive in an arbitrary scene. This information could be used for a number of useful purposes.

Reference-contexts: These can be summarised as follows: 1. The image segmentation system can be applied to images containing both flat and smooth shaded features (including anti-aliased and texture-mapped features). 2 There exist other transforms, such as the Walsh Transform <ref> (Gonzalez & Woods, 1992) </ref>, which can locate square-wave intensity components. However, these will then suffer from an inability to locate smooth intensity gradients, i.e. any such features will be recorded as a series of small square-waves instead of a more appropriate sine-wave coding. 14 2.

We will therefore use the CMC colour difference formula to estimate the perceptual significance of two adjacent colours.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, this report will concern itself primarily with this goal. A number of researchers have performed investigations which are closely related to this theme. A few of these are therefore worth mentioning here. 1 There has been a large body of work in the area of image quality metrics <ref> (Jacobson, 1995) </ref>. This field is dedicated to the concise perceptual evaluation of display devices. As such, these metrics are not concerned with the quality of arbitrary images displayed on these devices; and hence are of little benefit to us here.

It has been reported that this can induce colour difference variations in the order of 10-20% (Phillips, 1986). However, when compared with the variability of a typical observer, this error is not statistically significant. It is therefore felt that we do not need to compensate for this effect. 3.

Reference-contexts: This provided an accurate and convenient means of specifying an absolute colour, but it did not consider the perceptual relationship between points in the colour space. In fact, the perceptual non-uniformity of the XYZ colour space is about 80:1 <ref> (Poynton, 1993) </ref>, i.e. the discrepancy between the perceptual distance and the numerical distance of two XYZ colours can vary by up to about 8,000%. <p> In any CRT monitor, the intensity of light which is produced on the screen is proportional to the voltage applied to the electron guns, raised to a certain power. The value of this power is referred to as gamma, fl, and is theoretically equal to 2.5 <ref> (Poynton, 1993) </ref> 1 . In order to obtain linear RGB signals we must therefore pre-compensate for this non-linearity of the display device. <p> It is therefore felt that we do not need to compensate for this effect. 3. The Monitor Adjustments : The value of gamma can appear to vary depending upon the monitor's black level, or brightness, adjustment <ref> (Poynton, 1993) </ref>. Care should therefore be taken to ensure that the display's brightness control is set so that dark elements are reproduced correctly. 3.3 Implementing the Feature Extraction Stage Taking into consideration the above discussion, we can briefly present the current implementation of the feature extraction process.
