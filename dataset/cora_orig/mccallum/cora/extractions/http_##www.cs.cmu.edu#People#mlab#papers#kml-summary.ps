Abstract: A good model of the mechanics of a task is a resource for a robot, just as actuators and sensors are resources. The effective use of frictional, gravitational, and dynamic forces can substitute for extra actuators; the expectation derived from a good model can minimize sensing requirements. Despite this, most robot systems attempt to dominate or nullify task mechanics, rather than exploit them. There has been little effort to understand the manipulation capabilities of even the simplest robots under more complete mechanics models. This thesis addresses that knowledge deficit by studying graspless or nonprehensile manipulation. Nonprehensile manipulation exploits task mechanics to achieve a goal state without grasping, allowing simple mechanisms to accomplish complex tasks. With nonprehensile manipulation, a robot can manipulate objects too large or heavy to be grasped and lifted, and a low-degree-of-freedom robot can control more degrees-of-freedom of an object by allowing relative motion between the object and the manipulator. Two key problems are determining controllability of and motion planning for nonprehensile manipulation. The first problem is to determine whether the goal state of the object is reachable by nonprehensile manipulation, and the second is to find a manipulator motion to bring the object to the goal state. Part I studies these problems for quasistatic nonprehensile manipulation by pushing. I elucidate the controllability properties of objects pushed with point and line contact, and I describe a planner that finds stable pushing paths among obstacles. Pushing can also be used to simplify the hardware of a parts feeder; a one-degree-of-freedom robot, positioned over a conveyor, can position and orient any polygonal part on the conveyor by a series of pushes. Part II of the thesis studies dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. By considering dynamics, I show that even a one-degree-of-freedom robot can take a planar object to a full six-dimensional subset of its state space. Then I describe a planner that finds manipulator trajectories to perform dynamic tasks such as snatching an object from a table, rolling an object on the surface of the arm, and throwing and catching.

Reference-contexts: We have applied results of this thesis to develop a simple planar parts feeding system, dubbed "1JOC" (one-joint-over-conveyor, pronounced "one jock") (Akella et al. <ref> [1] </ref>). Using a single joint manipulator positioned over a conveyor, the 1JOC can bring any polygonal part from a random initial configuration on the conveyor to a desired configuration by a 2 series of pushes.

Reference-contexts: Applications of Nonprehensile Manipulation This section lists some applications of nonprehensile manipulation, to motivate the problems studied in this thesis. Parts feeding Nonprehensile manipulation is particularly suited for parts feeding for automated assembly. The vibratory bowl feeder (Boothroyd et al. <ref> [9] </ref>) and the SONY APOS (Advanced Parts Orienting System) (Hitakawa [19]) are two successful systems that use dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. In both cases, a vibratory motion is combined with specially-shaped fixtures to either bring parts to a desired orientation, or reject them and send them back to be reprocessed.

Reference-contexts: In the future, warehouses will be maintained by robots, and pushing will be a useful capability for these robots. Throwing can be a useful method for transferring parts and tools between robots with disjoint kinematic workspaces. According to Marvin Minsky (Dodd and Rossol <ref> [12] </ref>): It seems to me that assembly lines are silly and when we have good hand-eye robots, they will usually throw the part across the factory to the machine that wants it and that machine will catch it.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis, I explore the last approach and study the capabilities of very simple robots endowed with good models of mechanics. Based on the underlying mechanics model, we can define a taxonomy of manipulation models (Mason and Lynch <ref> [26] </ref>): * Kinematic manipulation. Kinematics (motion without regard to forces) are considered. * Static manipulation. Kinematics and static forces (such as Coulomb static friction and gravity) are considered. * Quasistatic manipulation. Kinematics, static forces, and quasistatic forces, such as sliding friction, are considered. Inertial forces are negligible. * Dynamic manipulation. <p> An Example Let's look at one example of nonprehensile manipulation: a nonprehensile "grasp." I will say that an object is "grasped" if it remains fixed to the manipulator as it moves. Using the taxonomy of manipulation models, we can define the following types of grasps (Mason and Lynch <ref> [26] </ref>): * Kinematic grasp. All relative motion is prevented considering only kinematic constraints. This is a form closure grasp, often used in fixturing. * Static grasp. All relative motion is prevented considering only kinematic constraints and static forces, such as gravity and static friction.

Reference-contexts: Robot programming languages Someday robot programming languages will include such primitives as "push" and "throw." Box pushing has become such a popular task for mobile robots that at least one mobile robot manufacturer is planning to include pushing simulation software with its simulation environment (Pignon <ref> [33] </ref>). 3 1.3. An Example Let's look at one example of nonprehensile manipulation: a nonprehensile "grasp." I will say that an object is "grasped" if it remains fixed to the manipulator as it moves.

Reference-contexts: In parts assembly tasks, prehensile manipulation seems to be preferable to nonprehensile manipulation, because small variations in the assembly contacts can lead to very different contact forces. With prehensile contact, arbitrary corrective forces can be applied to achieve successful mating, as with the RCC wrist (Whitney <ref> [39] </ref>). However, APOS provides an example of a simple type of assembly with nonprehensile manipulation | parts are "assembled" in the proper orientation in specially shaped depressions of a vibrating pallet. A key difference is that "assembly" is stochastic, and assembly error does not decrease monotonically during the operation.
