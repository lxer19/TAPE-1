Abstract: The dynamics of large networks is known to be complex. In this paper, we study a characterization of network dynamics in terms of transit times and losses. Applicability of this characterization is studied through experimental evaluation of connections on the Internet using instrumentation at the kernel level as well as at the application level. The results of this study indicate that this characterization is useful and yield several surprising outcomes which are presented.

Reference-contexts: A way to avoid this problem is to use a single host as the source and the destination of a connection, while the packets are routed via a specified gateway. The route can be specified by using the IP option, IP LSRR (Loose Source and Record Route) <ref> [1] </ref>. In this case, there is a single trace for both ends of the connection. From this trace, we can obtain parameters such as transit times, packet losses, etc. While the use of this approach simplifies the logistics and eliminates the need for clock synchronization it poses a new problem.

Reference-contexts: It allows us to probe the network at a specified rate, and collect detailed information. 2.2 Application level measurements We also used two programs, data source and data sink, which run as application processes 4 on any UNIX platform. These processes communicate using User Data-gram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [2] </ref>. UDP is a very simple protocol that has no flow control mechanism and provides unreliable data transfer between two application processes. Data source generates packets at a specified rate. It puts a timestamp and a packet number in each packet and gives it to the network.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this study has been to assess the dynamics of the Internet through experimental observations. Internet provides an unreliable data transfer service using the Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [3] </ref>. IP provides no guarantees regarding data transfer. Internet may lose, reorder or duplicate packets. 1 Transit times for the packets may also vary significantly.

Reference-contexts: The variability in the traffic and the complex network control algorithms (like routing) lead to a rather involved dynamic behavior. The design of end-to-end control algorithm requires the knowledge of network dynamics. Many algorithms in use today, such as flow control in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <ref> [4] </ref>, have been designed based on assumed network dynamics. The goal of this study has been to assess the dynamics of the Internet through experimental observations. Internet provides an unreliable data transfer service using the Internet Protocol (IP) [3]. IP provides no guarantees regarding data transfer.

Reference-contexts: We used two approaches for the study. Experiments were conducted using an instrumented kernel. We also made measurements at the application level. 2.1 Instrumented Kernel We have instrumented <ref> [5] </ref> an implementation of TCP running under UNIX on a SparcStation. It provides detailed information as a packet crosses the interface between TCP and IP. The basic approach taken in this instrumentation is to generate a log record for every packet sent or received on a monitored connection.

Computer facilities were provided in part by NSF grant CCR-8811954. 1 Note that even though the Internet may reorder or duplicate protocols (or the transport layer protocols in the ISO seven-layer network architecture <ref> [6] </ref>) provide a reliable data transfer service using the unreliable service provided by IP. Clearly the design of the transport layer protocol relies heavily on the assumptions regarding the network dynamics. From the end-to-end behavior of a connection, two most significant characteristics are the transit time and the packet loss.
