Reference-contexts: Finally, Section 7 gives some conclusions from the present work and discusses some issues still remaining for high-order accurate solution of the Euler equations on unstructured meshes. 2 Overview of Reconstruction Techniques The use of high-order spatial discretization on structured meshes is commonplace. The development of MUSCL schemes <ref> [1] </ref> focused on attaining high-order accuracy for smooth solutions, with a drop in accuracy near discontinuities and near extrema in the solution. More recently, essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes have been developed to ensure uniformly high-order accuracy for all points with a smooth neighborhood. <p> The derivatives computed give an ENO reconstruction when substituted into Equation 2. 4 Function Reconstruction The reconstruction should be uniformly high-order accurate for smooth functions. To show this, we have reconstructed the function u (x; y) = cos (x 2 + 4y) (26) on the square <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] using a series of unstructured triangular meshes ranging in size from 491 to 26651 vertices. The L 1 and L 2 norms of the error in reconstruction of this function are shown in Figure 2 for second- through fourth-order accuracy. <p> The derivatives computed give an ENO reconstruction when substituted into Equation 2. 4 Function Reconstruction The reconstruction should be uniformly high-order accurate for smooth functions. To show this, we have reconstructed the function u (x; y) = cos (x 2 + 4y) (26) on the square <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] using a series of unstructured triangular meshes ranging in size from 491 to 26651 vertices. The L 1 and L 2 norms of the error in reconstruction of this function are shown in Figure 2 for second- through fourth-order accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Stencil-searching ENO schemes share the problem that small changes in the solution from time step to time step causes stencil "switching" and prevents convergence to a numerical steady-state. This problem has recently been addressed by a new family of weighted ENO (WENO) schemes <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. These schemes use a weighted sum of all possible stencils rather than searching for the smoothest possible stencil. Stencils containing non-smooth data are not excluded by theses schemes, but instead are given weights on the order of truncation error. <p> Data-dependent weights are applied to the least-squares problem to virtually eliminate the influence of non-smooth data, and a data-dependent reconstruction is computed. As in WENO schemes, the data-dependent weights are chosen to satisfy the ENO property of Liu, Osher, and Chan <ref> [9] </ref>. An important difference between the present scheme and WENO schemes is their behavior when a smooth stencil does not exist. Where enough smooth data exists | near a single discontinuity or boundary, fl Similar in intent are SLIP schemes [15], which are closely related to FCT schemes. <p> compute an expansion R i (~x ~x i ) about v i that * conserves the mean; * has compact support; * reconstructs exactly polynomials of degree k (equivalently, R i (~x ~x i ) u (~x) = O ); * satisfies the ENO property of Liu, Osher, and Chan <ref> [9] </ref>. The remainder of this section describes this process in two dimensions. <p> In the present weighted least-squares context, weights are assigned to control volumes rather than to stencils. Nevertheless, the goal is to weight non-smooth data with O to satisfy the ENO condition of Liu, Osher, and Chan <ref> [9] </ref>. We seek to construct a data-dependent weight that will multi ply the previously calculated geometric weight. This construction is based on two observations. 1. <p> One appropriate weighting is W DD 1 fi fi j~x j ~x i j fi (k+1) ; (21) where R fi fi j~x j ~x i j fi (k+1) is a smoothness indicator anal ogous to the divided difference indicators of <ref> [9, 10] </ref> but appropriate for unstructured meshes and least-squares reconstruction. R is computed from a data-independent least-squares reconstruction, as described above. We are concerned only with the asymptotic behavior of W DD ij , so the value of k is not critical; 0.1 seems to be a good choice. <p> For stencils that are not entirely smooth, the data-dependent weight for non-smooth data is smaller than that for smooth data by a factor of the order of truncation error. These weightings satisfy the ENO condition of Liu, Osher, and Chan <ref> [9] </ref>. The data-dependent least-squares problem is closely related to the data-independent problem. The jth row in the least-squares problem of Equation 12 is modified by scaling with the data-dependent weight.

This would not be true if non-smooth data were included. In contrast, stencil-searching ENO schemes such as Abgrall's <ref> [12] </ref> can sometimes avoid local degradation of accuracy near a discontinuity by extending the stencil farther away from the discontinuity. However, for cases with medium resolution in which some control volumes do not have enough smoothly connected neighbors, stencil-searching schemes will use non-smooth (and therefore irrelevant) data.
