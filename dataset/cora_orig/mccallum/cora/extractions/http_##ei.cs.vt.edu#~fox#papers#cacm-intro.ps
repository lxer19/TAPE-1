Title: Introduction to Special Issue on Digital Libraries Draft 1/2/95  
Author: by Edward A. Fox, Robert Akscyn, Richard Furuta, and John Leggett 
Affiliation: Intro  
Abstract: 1995 marks the 50th anniversary of Vannevar Bush's seminal article [5] that paved the way for fields like information retrieval and hypertext. Bush, through many efforts, helped raise the level of public support for scientific research at the end of World War II. Today we have a similar opportunity to invest in research and education to: bring the world closer together, improve our environment, and fulfill the age-old dream of every human being gaining ready access to humanity's store of information. This era and what we are building go by many names, e.g., Cyberspace, Global Information Infrastructure, Infobahn, Information Age, Information (Super)Highway, Interspace, and Paperless Society. They are all supported by networking (e.g., the Internet). However, their essence is information. Information is what flows over the networks, what is presented to us by our consumer electronics devices, what is manipulated by our computers, and what is stored in our libraries. Libraries exist in many forms and are of many types. In computing, "code libraries" has been a part of the world of software engineering. "Object libraries" are part of object-oriented programming efforts. With multimedia technology we now have image libraries, audio libraries, and even digital video libraries. We might also think of libraries when we refer to collections that now reside in "databases", "knowledge bases", "text bases," "gopherspace", or the "World-Wide Web" (WWW). At the same time, "traditional" libraries' budgets devote an ever-increasing share to "electronic services", whether in the form of CD-ROMs, online public access catalogs, or online databases. This trend will continue, as digital storage costs go down relative to the cost of library shelf-space, and as electronic services become more affordable, widely available, and usable. Other forces are encouraging the demand and supply for electronically accessible information, like the hunger of people for news and learning, the pride of authoring as evidenced by local or vanity publishing, the desire to collaborate or at least share with colleagues, the pressures of reorganization and restructuring, the ubiquitous presence of electronic publishing, the excitement of exploring in an expanding sea of information, and the push to use new technological tools. These are some of the many reasons that humanity is now working toward the

Reference-contexts: Though the co-authors of this article are extensively involved in electronic and other publishing activities, and make extensive personal use of hypertext systems (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), they have all grown in appreciation of the value of talented intermediaries, and believe that considerable research is required to incorporate their knowledge into expert library systems. Finally, some assume that with digital libraries everything will be in digital form (see [23]). <p> Second is the field of hypermedia. Even more radical changes will occur in the publishing process when authors learn to write with the aid of powerful hypertext systems, and collaborate through them on articles (like was done on this one) <ref> [1] </ref>. As scholarly activities yield rich hyperbases and knowledge bases, multiple uses will be made through the help of intelligent presentation systems, that generate personalized organizations and render multimedia object collections in the most suitable fashion [19].

Reference-contexts: Yet, digital libraries will simply shift the point of equilibrium in each of these scales. For example, some claim we are finally "Beyond Paper", which is the title of a recent work on the Adobe Acrobat product family <ref> [2] </ref>. Unhappily (from an ecological perspective) increased use of computers has correlated with increased use of paper, but finally tools are emerging that may ameliorate that trend. <p> First, there is the field of electronic publishing. Tools like Adobe Acrobat allow us to directly convert our paper documents to electronic ones, and also add value in terms of "miniature" or thumbnail sketches of pages, hypertext links, and search services <ref> [2] </ref>. Standards like SGML facilitate dual-use publishing, for paper and more flexible electronic delivery, and are one of the pillars of the success of the WWW. Thus, Mosaic [27] depends on HTML, defined by an SGML Document Type Definition.

Reference-contexts: Introduction to Special Issue on Digital Libraries - Draft 1/2/95 by Edward A. Fox, Robert Akscyn, Richard Furuta, and John Leggett Intro 1995 marks the 50th anniversary of Vannevar Bush's seminal article <ref> [5] </ref> that paved the way for fields like information retrieval and hypertext. Bush, through many efforts, helped raise the level of public support for scientific research at the end of World War II. <p> To modern-day users of the World-Wide Web it suggests more of the same, with sure-to-come improvements in performance, organization, functionality, and usability. Hypertext researchers recall Bush's vision of linked multimedia objects that encompass humanity's store of information <ref> [5] </ref>. Those studying collaboration technologies see digital libraries as the space in which people communicate, share and produce new knowledge and knowledge products. Those working on education technology see digital libraries as the support for learning, whether formal or informal [24]. In this issue we embrace all of these perspectives.

Reference-contexts: To many computer professionals, a "digital library" is simply a distributed text-based information system <ref> [7] </ref>, a collection of distributed information services [32], a distributed space of interlinked information [27], or a networked multimedia information system. <p> Bell et al. discuss an information retrieval system available for anonymous FTP and how compression techniques make it suitable for handling large text collections [4]. Croft describes how information retrieval methods, enhanced with artificial intelligence techniques, can be used in digital libraries <ref> [7] </ref>. Fox summarizes a range of efforts to make computer science reports readily available [13A], leading into French et al.'s discussion of the WATERS project [16] and Lagoze and Davis' explanation of the Dienst system [22]. <p> Text analysis and information retrieval techniques are crucial for converting, indexing, representing, searching, and presenting desired information <ref> [7] </ref>. Human-computer interaction methods for handling information are of particular importance to help users more effectively search, learn about, organize, and utilize the vast stores that will be found in digital libraries [26]. They are emerging as powerful aids when a user-centered design approach is adopted [18].

These statements expand upon earlier discussions (e.g., [12]), and will have direct impact on you, the computing profession, and the world of electronic publishing. <p> Concluding the issue are the ACM Electonic Publishing articles, which illustrate many of the points raised earlier.

They summarize current practice in scientific publishing, list the many breakdowns now visible, and lay out ACM's response to these challenges: a digital library, two "tracks" of publications, experiments, new services, and careful development of policies and guidelines [9, 10]. <p> Thus, Mosaic [27] depends on HTML, defined by an SGML Document Type Definition. We see SGML used in the CORE [11] and Envision [14, 18] projects, and as an ongoing foundation for ACM publishing plans <ref> [8, 9, 10, 12] </ref>.

They provide a human-computer interaction perspective on the field of information retrieval. <p> Text analysis and information retrieval techniques are crucial for converting, indexing, representing, searching, and presenting desired information [7]. Human-computer interaction methods for handling information are of particular importance to help users more effectively search, learn about, organize, and utilize the vast stores that will be found in digital libraries <ref> [26] </ref>. They are emerging as powerful aids when a user-centered design approach is adopted [18]. For More Information As a snapshot this issue is necessarily incomplete in its characterization of digital libraries. Many other important projects and perspectives have been omitted.

Reference-contexts: To many computer professionals, a "digital library" is simply a distributed text-based information system [7], a collection of distributed information services [32], a distributed space of interlinked information <ref> [27] </ref>, or a networked multimedia information system. It may have materials that are mostly from outside an organization, that are generally of high value, and where special electronic services have added to the quality during creation, collection, organization, and/or use [29]. <p> First is an "In Memorium to Laurence Rosenberg", whose many years of devoted service to NSF ended while he was working on this initiative. Then, listed in alphabetical order by institution name, are short overviews of the six projects funded through this initiative <ref> [6, 21, 32, 30, 27, 3] </ref>. These cover a broad range of digital library content areas and types, technical approaches, system architectures, and research problems. For each, pointers are given to project home pages on the WWW, so readers can track progress over the four year period of each award. <p> Standards like SGML facilitate dual-use publishing, for paper and more flexible electronic delivery, and are one of the pillars of the success of the WWW. Thus, Mosaic <ref> [27] </ref> depends on HTML, defined by an SGML Document Type Definition. We see SGML used in the CORE [11] and Envision [14, 18] projects, and as an ongoing foundation for ACM publishing plans [8, 9, 10, 12].

Reference-contexts: In 1994 there were numerous talks, panels, tutorials, workshops (e.g., [29]) and conferences (e.g., <ref> [28] </ref>) on digital libraries. EXTREME PERSPECTIVES. Discussions of digital libraries often begin by picking an extreme point on a spectrum or scale (see also [23]). Yet, digital libraries will simply shift the point of equilibrium in each of these scales. <p> We note that to many, intellectual property rights issues and how revenue streams can be obtained from digital libraries is the most important open problem! The largest digital library conference has proceedings available over WWW <ref> [28] </ref>. There are many insightful discussions, proposals of new research ideas, descriptions of base technologies, and explanations of how the broad concept of a digital library fits in with the needs of specific user communities and the information they require.

To modern-day users of the World-Wide Web it suggests more of the same, with sure-to-come improvements in performance, organization, functionality, and usability. Hypertext researchers recall Bush's vision of linked multimedia objects that encompass humanity's store of information [5]. <p> This work also has numerous pointers to people, projects, institutions and other reference works in the area. For a perspective on the role the computer industry should have in this field, see <ref> [29] </ref>. This report outlines IBM's perspective on key supporting technologies and on the unique challenges highlighted by the emergence of digital libraries. We expect there to be considerable interest from the corporate sector as well as from government agencies in this important area of information technology.

Reference-contexts: Another extreme statement calls for elimination of intermediaries (search intermediaries, librarians, retailers, distributors and others) who "interfere" in the process of interchange between authors and readers (whose roles too will be blurred as a universal hypertext library system evolves), as is considered in <ref> [31] </ref>. <p> They help us enlarge our view of digital libraries, to facilitate richer collaboration, varied media, and works that are more transitory than archival publications. Wiederhold <ref> [31] </ref> pushes us even further, to consider the whole enterprise of scholarly and electronic publishing. He points out the new capabilities that digital libraries will provide, the implications of networked information interchange on the world of publishing, and predicts shifts in roles, responsibilities, revenues and services. <p> We see SGML used in the CORE [11] and Envision [14, 18] projects, and as an ongoing foundation for ACM publishing plans [8, 9, 10, 12]. Clearly, significant changes in publishing are occuring as a result of electronic publishing technology and its blending with networked information <ref> [31] </ref>. Second is the field of hypermedia. Even more radical changes will occur in the publishing process when authors learn to write with the aid of powerful hypertext systems, and collaborate through them on articles (like was done on this one) [1].
