Abstract: We provide an O(n 2 log 1 ffi ) time randomized algorithm to check whether a given operation f : S fi S ! S is associative (where n = jSj and ffi is the error probability of the algorithm). We prove this performance is optimal up to a constant factor even in case the operation is "cancellative". No sub-n 3 time algorithm was previously known for this task. More generally we give an O(n c ) time randomized algorithm to check whether

Reference-contexts: F. W. Light observed in 1949 <ref> [2] </ref> that, if R S is a set of generators of S, i.e. a collection such that every element of S is representable as some product of elements of R, then it suffices to test all triples in which b is an element of R. <p> Thus the runtime of our randomized algorithm as a function of input size is tight up to a constant factor.

Reference-contexts: in the theorem follows from the lemma by defining: g : S 3 ! S=2 In the last expression we have abbreviated notation by using the natural embedding S !

Reference-contexts: Each of these is given by a polynomial over Z=p in the (random) variables used in the algorithm. The degree of each polynomial is most k, and if the operation is not associative then at least one is nonzero. By a lemma of J. T. Schwartz <ref> [5] </ref>, the fraction of assignments on which that polynomial is 0 is at most k=p. 8 Open Questions While a nonassociative operation has a short witness for this property | and we are able, in fact, to efficiently find such a witness | we do not know of any short witness

Reference-contexts: Indeed, this points out that a sub-O (n 2 ) algorithm can be foiled by simply changing the product of a random pair of elements. Using Yao's lemma <ref> [7] </ref> (the application of von Neumann's minimax theorem to show equivalence of randomized and distributional complexities), the (n 2 ) lower bound holds for randomized algorithms as well.
