Abstract: Two view-based object recognition algorithms are compared: (1) a heuristic algorithm based on oriented filters, and (2) a support vector learning machine trained on low-resolution images of the objects. Classification performance is assessed using a high number of images generated by a computer graphics system under precisely controlled conditions. Training- and test-images show a set of 25 realistic three-dimensional models of chairs from viewing directions spread over the upper half of the viewing sphere. The percentage of correct identification of all 25 objects is measured. in: C. von der Malsburg, W. von Seelen, J. C. Vorbruggen, & B. Sendhoff (eds.): Artificial Neural Networks --- ICANN'96. Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 1112, Berlin, 1996, 251 --256 In computer vision, view-based models of object recognition have become more and more influential in recent years. Moreover, psychophysical evidence has been found for a view-based representation of objects in humans (Bulthoff and Edel-man, 1992). Unlike viewpoint-invariant representations using structural descriptions (e.g. Marr and Nishihara, 1978), viewpoint-dependent models do not require a three-dimensional representation (Poggio, Edelman 1990, Lades et.al., 1993). The present study compares two recognition algorithms that are explained in the following sections.
