Reference-contexts: We found that a simple Chappel amplifier <ref> [CHAP88] </ref> did just fine; simulations show that the systematic offset (as _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Rev06.0 Fri, Feb 20, 1998 UNC CONFIDENTIAL Section IV.9.1 Introduction Pixel-Flow System Documentation Clock Input Buffer & DLL IV.9 - 16 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ opposed to the offset due to transistor mismatch) is only about 10mV for this amplifier, and doesnt

Reference-contexts: The latter objective is the most difficult to realize. To this end, we use differential delay stages, with their excellent common mode noise rejection, and the replica bias technique described in <ref> [YOUN92] </ref> and [MANE93]. In our implementation, the differential stages use a simple nmos current source, and pmos loads constructed as shown in Figure 3.2. <p> It is also possible to use the bias voltage to control delay, and replica-bias the resistor control voltage (as in <ref> [YOUN92] </ref>). This latter technique, however, requires a current reference that is power supply insensitive, where Horowitz technique doesnt. delay multiplexers in the PixelFlow ClkAlign cell.

Reference-contexts: Altogether, the design of the clock aligner consumed perhaps 4 man months of effort. 2.1 DLL Using Phase Interpolation An early attempt adopted a method described in <ref> [LEE94] </ref>. Though described in that paper as a delay locked loop, this type of clock aligner operates neither on frequency, as in a PLL, nor on time delay, as in a classic DLL, but rather controls directly the phase shift between a reference clock and the controlled clock. <p> Rather than describe this method in detail, the reader is referred to the paper <ref> [LEE94] </ref>. clock aligner is outlined here briefly: The salphasic reference clocks SClk-H,L- are buffered in a DCC Amp, a circuit that uses feedback to keep its output duty factor fixed at 50%. <p> Horowitz suggested an alternate approach based on the same idea, which we describe next. 2.2 DLL Based on Phase Interpolation of Quadrature Clocks at Full Frequency interpolation proposed by <ref> [Lee94] </ref>, but operating entirely on signals at the full clock frequency. This circuit obtains two quadtrature clocks at the full frequency by employing a second true delay-locked loop.

Reference-contexts: These inputs are further buffered through a pair of scaled inverters, then input to the phase detectors finite state machine. This design was shamelessly plagiarized from one published by the Swiss Center for Microelectronics <ref> [ELE96] </ref>, but is fairly unremarkable other than having no dead band. The size of the deadband (the amplitude of the output pulses on PhDet-H,L- when the detector is at lock) was adjusted by ratioing the nfets in the NAND that produces ResetL.
