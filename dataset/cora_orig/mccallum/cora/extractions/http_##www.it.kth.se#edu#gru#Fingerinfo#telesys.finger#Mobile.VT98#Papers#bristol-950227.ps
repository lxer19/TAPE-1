Title: Abstract  
Note: This work is part of the Walkstation II project 1  
Abstract: The goals of this project and a summary of what has been achieved thus far ar e presented. This includes a status report on our Mobile INTernet router which factors mobility out of the user device. Using this platform, we discuss the desirability of having multiple r eceivers, programmable radios, and new I/O devices. This paper will address how new technologies will e n a b l e f u t u re m o b i l e d i s t r i b u t e d c o m p u t i n g a n d communication systems. We seek to not only cut the umbilical cord which binds users to specif ic sites, but to allow users to easily make use of differ ent infrastructures as necessary.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Mobile users expect global network connectivity , mobility transparent applications, a quality of service comparable to that of fixed networks, and of course low cost. The Walkstation Project <ref> [4] </ref> involves researchers from different areas in order to f ind a solution via a global system approach. <p> Rather than continue these new driver and network implementations we realized that this functionality could be partitioned out of the device into a separate device which would appear to the user as a default router. W e called this device a Mobile INTernet (MINT) router <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. It has at least two network interfaces - one to the local host and one to the mobile LAN. <p> In order to provide user transparent mobility , we have adopted a different approach, we have placed all of the facilities needed for mobility into a Mobile INT ernet (MINT) Router <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Utilizing this separate router , the user attaches their machine to this device which provides all of the support, both hardware and software, for tetherless mobility. 8. Mobile INTernet router status Eight prototype MINTs have been constructed.

Reference-contexts: The amplification comes by way of enhanced persistence and consistency via augmented memory. He envisions using a cellular phone and modem for network connectivity, thus allowing consultation with others in real-time while trying to deal with a problem, this is another method of intelligence amplification. The INFOPAD <ref> [10] </ref> project is lead by Professor Robert Brodersen at the University of California at Berkeley. This ARPA project is focusing on designing and building a low power low cost information terminal . The terminal provides audio input and output, video output, pen input, and X windows functionality.

Reference-contexts: This leads to a requirement to both support a currently used link and the need for another link to use for exploring for a new base station. During the course of designing a SNMP MIB for the direct sequence spread spectrum radio built as part of the current project <ref> [15] </ref>, we realized that in order to do power management it was useful to have one channel for user communication while using another channel for control wireless access mobility information for the cell.

Reference-contexts: A new implementation of the radio with both transmitter and receiver implemented on one circuit board has recently been completed. The CMU MACH operating system has been ported to this platform <ref> [16] </ref>. Thus all the usual TCP/IP networking code is available, including support for routing. The EPROM contains support for BOOTP and TFTP as well as a ROM based file system (which the operating system uses to reduce the amount of RAM needed).

Reference-contexts: To exploit the characteristics of mobility there must be operating system and application level support for mobility. Yuejin George Liu at KTH is currently developing a Mobile Applications Programming Interface (API) to address these issues <ref> [17, 18] </ref>. What information is necessary and how applications can determine the characteristics of the communication channel or be notified of changes has not been determined. As a preliminary step we are implementing SNMP for our MINT router.

Reference-contexts: The reason for this transition is the need to significantly reduce power, while increasing the (virtual) size of the user interface. The neural interface technology is currently being investigated by researchers who are interested in developing visual prosthesis, see for example <ref> [19] </ref>. Between this vision of the future and our current state we have lots of work to do.
