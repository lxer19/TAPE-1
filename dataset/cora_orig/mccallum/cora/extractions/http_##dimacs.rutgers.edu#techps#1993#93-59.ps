Abstract: We consider the problem of representing the visibility graph of line segments as a union of cliques and bipartite cliques. Given a graph G, a family G = fG 1 ; G 2 ; : : : ; G k g is called a clique cover of G if (i) each G i is a clique or a bipartite clique, and (ii) the union of G i is G. The size of the clique cover G is defined as P k i=1 n i , where n i is the number of vertices in G i . Our main result is that there exist visibility graphs of n nonintersecting line segments in the plane whose smallest clique cover has size (n 2 = log 2 n). An upper bound of O(n 2 = log n) on the clique cover follows from a well-known result in extremal graph theory. On the other hand, we show that the visibility graph of a simple polygon always admits a clique cover of size O(n log 3 n), and that there are simple polygons whose visibility graphs require a clique cover of size (n log n).

Reference-contexts: The cardinality of the set Z " fn + 1; : : : ; 2ng is a Binomial random variable with parameters n and p. By the standard estimates for Binomial distributions (see for instance <ref> [2, Appendix A] </ref>), jZj np=2 with high probability; high probability means "with probability approaching 1 as n goes to infinity". <p> Remark.

Reference-contexts: Let v (fl) denote the vertex of P 1 that the rays corresponding to points on the edge fl intersect before crossing the boundary of P 1 . By considering leftward-directed rays, define a similar map M 2 for P 2 . By a result of Chazelle and Guibas <ref> [8] </ref>, each M i is a convex planar subdivision having O (n) faces, edges, and vertices. Let 1 ; 2 denote the set of edges in M 1 and in M 2 , respectively.

Reference-contexts: But, then Eq. (3) implies that i = l and j = k, which contradicts our assumption that fi; jg 6= fk; lg. It is a well-known fact of number theory that there exists a prime number between m and 2m, for any m 1; see for instance <ref> [13] </ref>. Thus, we can always find a prime p with b m=8c &lt; p b m=2c. This completes the proof that jT (m)j = fi ( p The preceding proof also gives an O (m) time algorithm for constructing a set T (m) with jT (m)j = fi ( m).

Reference-contexts: Then, f (S) = O (n log 3 n). 3.2 A lower bound We (constructively) prove that there are simple polygons on n vertices whose visibility graphs require clique covers of size (n log n). The combinatorial lemma needed here follows from a result of Katona and Szemeredi <ref> [14] </ref>, and our proof below applies their approach.

Reference-contexts: This result is also close to the best possible | any graph on n vertices has a clique cover of size O (n 2 = log n) <ref> [16] </ref>. Our proof of the lower bound in Eq. (1) uses a non-constructive, probabilistic argument. By a constructive method, we can prove a slightly weaker result, namely, f (n) = (n 3=2 ).
