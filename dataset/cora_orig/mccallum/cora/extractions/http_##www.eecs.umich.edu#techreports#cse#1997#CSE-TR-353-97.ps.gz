Abstract: We propose an efficient flow-control scheme for atm abr multicast services. We develop a second-order rate-control algorithm to deal with the variation in feedback delay resulting from dynamic "drift" of the bottleneck location within a multicast tree. The proposed scheme makes the rate process converge to the available bandwidth of the multicast-connection's most congested link. It also confines the buffer occupancy to a target regime bounded by a given (finite) buffer capacity at the bottleneck node. Using fluid approximation, we model the proposed scheme and study the system dynamics under the most stressful traffic conditions. We derive expressions for queue buildups and average throughputs in both transient and equilibrium states. We identify the system control factors that govern the system dynamics and develop an optimal control condition which guarantees monotonic convergence of the system state to the target regime from an arbitrary initial value.

Reference-contexts: Supporting abr pt-to-mpt connection service poses a number of new challenges not encountered in providing abr service on unicast connections. One of the major problems, especially in large multicast trees, is commonly known as the feedback implosion problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Since our goal is to adjust the source transmission rate to match the bottleneck link bandwidth, the source need to collect congestion feedback from all branches in the multicast tree.

Reference-contexts: The flow-control scheme should also be able to detect and remove non-responsive branches in order to prevent them from stalling the entire connection. Roberts <ref> [2, 3] </ref> proposed a multicast flow-control scheme which is based on EPRCA (Explicit Proportional Rate Control Algorithm) and extends unicast to multicast operations. The authors of [4-6] established a framework for extending an existing unicast congestion-control protocol to a multicast environment.

Reference-contexts: The paper concludes with Section 7. 2 The Proposed Scheme As in the existing schemes, we also use the efci (Explicit Forward Congestion Indication) bit and rm (Resource Management) cells to convey network congestion information. However, we refine the rm cell format <ref> [7] </ref> such that it contains both the cell-rate (first-order) control and the rate-parameter (second-order) control information. More specifically, two new one-bit fields, bci (Buffer Congestion Indication) and nmq (New Maximum Queue), are defined.

Reference-contexts: We model this system using the first-order fluid approximation, which models the system with coupled time-delayed differential equations <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. In this model, we use the 4 real-valued deterministic functions R (t) and Q (t) to approximate a discrete stochastic rate process R (t) at the source and a queue length process Q (t) at the bottleneck node, respectively. <p> Here R (t) represents the fluid approximation to cell-transmission throughput. The average throughput is then given by lim t!1 1 R t 0 R (v)dv. Q (t) is an approximation to the system bottleneck queue-length process. This first-order fluid model has been shown in <ref> [8] </ref> to be a good approximation when the system is heavily-loaded. As mentioned earlier, the system bottleneck dynamically drifts around different paths of the pt-to-mpt connection as the cross-traffic of other connections varies with time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the rate adjustment at the source can be modeled by linear-increase and exponential-decrease in a continuous-time domain as follows <ref> [10] </ref>: R (t) = R (t 0 ) + ff (t t 0 ); linear increase (ff &gt; 0) R (t 0 )e (1fi) (tt 0 ) ; exponential decrease (fi &lt; 1) (3.2) where t is the current time; t 0 the time of the last rate-update; ff = a=

Reference-contexts: Thus, we explicitly include the variation of round trip delay in our model, and study its relationship with multicast flow-control algorithms. We discuss this issue in the next section. 4 The Second-Order Rate-Control As discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>, increasing or decreasing R (t) is not effective enough to have Q max upper bounded by C max when the system bottleneck feedback delay t varies.
