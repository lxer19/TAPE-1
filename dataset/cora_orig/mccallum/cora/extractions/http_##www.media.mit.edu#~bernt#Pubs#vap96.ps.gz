Abstract: In [SC96] we presented a technique to determine the identity of objects in a scene using multidimensional histograms of the responses of a vector of local linear neighborhood operators (receptive fields). This technique can be used to determine the most probable objects in a scene, independent of the object's position, image-plane orientation and scale. The present paper describes experiments to evaluate the robustness of multidimensional receptive field histograms to view point changes, using the Columbia image database [MN95]. In this experiment we examine the performance of different filter combinations, histogram matching functions and design parameter of the multidimensional histograms. The first part of the paper summarizes the mathematical foundations of multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms. The second part of the paper shows the experimental evaluation of the robustness of the approach to view point changes (3D-rotation).

Furthermore the histogram matching is relatively immune to minor occlusions. This was demonstrated by Swain and Ballard in the original work on color histograms <ref> [SB91] </ref>. Signal intensity variations are accommodated by the use of energy normalized convolution with robust filters such as Gabor filters and Gaussian derivatives. To test robustness in relation to noise we completed a series of experiments with artificial and real images, where we added Gaussian noise.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [SC96] </ref> we generalized the color histogram approach of Swain and Ballard [SB91] to the use of Multiple Receptive Field Histograms. The main idea of the approach is to calculate multidimensional histogram of the response of a vector of receptive fields. <p> The main idea of the approach is to calculate multidimensional histogram of the response of a vector of receptive fields. An object in an image can be identified by matching multi-dimensional histogram from a region of the image with a histogram of the sample of the object. In <ref> [SC96] </ref> we have shown that the technique can be used to identify objects in the presence of image plane rotation and scale. The aim of this paper is to examine the robustness of the approach under view point changes. <p> The experiments also show that we can use low resolution for each axis of a receptive field histogram and still obtain high recognition rates. The first part presents shortly the mathematical foundations of multidimensional receptive field histograms (see for details <ref> [SC96] </ref>). In the second part of the paper we describe experiments to evaluate the robustness of the approach under 3D-rotation. The final section draws conclusions from the results of the experiments. 1 2 Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms In [SC96] we did identify three main parameters of the multidimensional receptive field histogram <p> shortly the mathematical foundations of multidimensional receptive field histograms (see for details <ref> [SC96] </ref>). In the second part of the paper we describe experiments to evaluate the robustness of the approach under 3D-rotation. The final section draws conclusions from the results of the experiments. 1 2 Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms In [SC96] we did identify three main parameters of the multidimensional receptive field histogram approach: * The choice of local property measurements or the receptive field functions. <p> In section 3 we will describe the local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives, which we use throughout the paper. * Measurement for the comparison of the histograms. In <ref> [SC96] </ref> we summarized that 2 and "intersection" are the most suitable comparison measurements. Section 4 defines them. * Design parameter of the histograms: number of dimensions of the histogram (each axis corresponds to one local property) and resolution of each axis (number of bins per axis). <p> Equivariant means that they vary in a uniform manner which is represented by a translation in a parameter space. We also describe two rotation invariant characteristics, namely the magnitude of the first Gaussian derivative and the Laplace operator. As we saw in the experiments in <ref> [SC96] </ref>, the comparison measurement determines the separability between histograms. The two best measures (of the experiments in [SC96]) for the histogram comparison are introduced in section 4. In the experiments (see section 6) we will examine the robustness of these comparison measurements under view point changes. <p> We also describe two rotation invariant characteristics, namely the magnitude of the first Gaussian derivative and the Laplace operator. As we saw in the experiments in <ref> [SC96] </ref>, the comparison measurement determines the separability between histograms. The two best measures (of the experiments in [SC96]) for the histogram comparison are introduced in section 4. In the experiments (see section 6) we will examine the robustness of these comparison measurements under view point changes. The experiments described in this paper examine the dependency of the robustness to 3D-rotation and the design parameter of the histograms. <p> As normalization function we are using the Energie normalization function, which is described in section 3.2. This normalization has been shown to be the most robust in the presence of additive Gaussian noise <ref> [SC96] </ref>. 3.1 Local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives As stated in [SC96], it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this paper we are only using filters which are based on Gaussian derivatives. <p> As normalization function we are using the Energie normalization function, which is described in section 3.2.

In this paper we are only using filters which are based on Gaussian derivatives. As described above the approach can be used with any receptive field function (see [SC96] for further receptive field functions as i.e. <p> Local characteristics based on Gaussian derivatives As stated in <ref> [SC96] </ref>, it is desirable that local properties be equivariant to scale and 2D-rotation. In this paper we are only using filters which are based on Gaussian derivatives. As described above the approach can be used with any receptive field function (see [SC96] for further receptive field functions as i.e. Gabor filter). By using the Gaussian derivatives one can explicitly select the scale. This is achieved by adapting the variance of the derivative. <p> Normalization should be considered from at least two points of view. The first point concerns how well the normalized convolution behaves in the presence of additive noise (see experiments in <ref> [SC96] </ref>). The second point concerns how the normalized convolution responds to variations in signal intensity due to differences in ambient light intensity, aperture setting or digitizer gain. <p> We have compared the robustness of no normalization to three forms of normalization: Normalization by MaxMin, Normalization by Energie and Normalization by Variance (see <ref> [SC96] </ref>). <p> Possible similarity measures can be drawn from signal pro cessing as well as from statistics. In <ref> [SC96] </ref> we concluded that the best measurements to compare histograms are the "intersection"- measurement of Swain and Ballard and the 2 distance, which we will introduce in the following. 3 4.1 2 test The proper method proposed by mathematical statistics for the comparison of two histograms is the 2 -test. 2 <p> Although we do not know the theoretical distribution in the general case, we have found that 2 T works well in practice: 2 (H (i; j) T (i; j)) 2 (12) The second calculation 2 TH compares two real histograms. As we know from the results of <ref> [SC96] </ref> the following 2 T H gives more reliable results: 2 (H (i; j) T (i; j)) 2 (13) 4.2 Intersection Swain and Ballard [SB91] used the following intersection value to compare two color-histograms: "(H; T ) = i;j min (H (i; j); T (i; j)) (14) The advantage of this <p> To test robustness in relation to noise we completed a series of experiments with artificial and real images, where we added Gaussian noise. The impact on the histograms (measured with an appropriate distance measure) are shown in <ref> [SC96] </ref>. 5.2 Application for Object Recognition This section describes an illustration of the use of multidimensional receptive field histograms for object recognition. The system we describe is only an initial experiment to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach for object recognition. <p> Therefore we think we will achieve even higher recognition rates by adding dimensions to the histograms. The increase of memory can be probably compensated by the decrease of the resolution. 8 ff (see text). ff (see text). 9 7 Conclusion In <ref> [SC96] </ref> we have shown how the color histogram matching technique of Swain and Ballard can be generalized to use vectors of local image properties measured by normalized convolution with local receptive fields.
