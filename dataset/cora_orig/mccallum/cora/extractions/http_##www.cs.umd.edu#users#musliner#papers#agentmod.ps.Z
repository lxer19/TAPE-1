Reference-contexts: The scheduler is given a detailed model of the set of tasks to be executed, their periods, jitter, latency, and other temporal constraints, and various additional information such as precedence requirements. Using this task model, the scheduler uses an iterative constraint envelope scheduling technique <ref> (Boddy, Carciofini, & Hadden 1992) </ref> to develop a schedule that meets all the requirements. Although this program initially seems less related to agent modeling, the complex task modeling capabilities (particularly the expressive temporal constraint language) are closely tied to traditional AI planners and plan representations.

Reference-contexts: HTC also has projects that use models of autonomous behavior in the prescriptive plan-and-execute fashion common in AI. For example, one project is pursuing an agent-based approach to human-computer interaction and dynamic generation of context-sensitive displays. In this program, the UM-PRS <ref> (Lee et al. 1994) </ref> implementation of the Procedural Reasoning System (Georgeff & Ingrand 1989; Ingrand, Georgeff, & Rao 1992) is being used to capture and reactively execute the procedures involved in a search-and-rescue (SAR) domain.

Reference-contexts: Similar to the Pilot's Associate programs, the RPA will consist of a suite of five cooperating knowledge-based systems whose collective goal will be to assist the aircraft crew in understanding the vast array of battlefield information, planning the mission, and managing the complex systems of an advanced helicopter <ref> (McBryan & Hall 1994) </ref>. Figure 3 illustrates the overall architecture for the RPA system. Task modeling plays significant roles in several of the system modules and their inter-module communications. Honeywell is participating in the design, development and evaluation of the Cockpit Information Manager (CIM) module (Miller & Riley 1994).

Reference-contexts: For example, the Pilot's Associate (PA) system, sponsored by DARPA and the U.S. Air Force, contained models of many tasks that pilots were expected to perform <ref> (Miller & Riley 1994) </ref>. During a flight, the PA actively monitored the human pilot's activities and attempted to match them against its task models, in order to understand what information needs the human had, and what tasks the PA should perform autonomously when, for example, the human was too busy. <p> Figure 3 illustrates the overall architecture for the RPA system. Task modeling plays significant roles in several of the system modules and their inter-module communications. Honeywell is participating in the design, development and evaluation of the Cockpit Information Manager (CIM) module <ref> (Miller & Riley 1994) </ref>. Overall, the RPA architecture relies on task modeling to coordinate its cooperating knowledge-based systems.

Reference-contexts: There are two thrusts within this program. First, we are developing techniques, utilizing HTC's Mixed-Initiative Model of human/machine interactions <ref> (Riley 1989) </ref>, for extending current simulation tools so that they can consider the information flow between multiple distributed intelligent actors| enabling them to better analyze the complex interactions between ground crews, multiple air crews, and intelligent automation systems which will characterize most advanced air traffic management concepts.
