Title: An Evaluation of Access Methods for Spatial Networks

Abstract: Current Spatial Database Management Systems (SDBMS) provide efficient access methods and operators for point and range queries over collections of spatial points, line segments, and polygons. However, it is not clear if they can efficiently support network computations which traverse line-segments in a spatial network based on connectivity rather than geographic proximity. It can be shown that the expected I/O cost for many network operations can be reduced by maximizing the Weighted Connectivity Residue Ratio (WCRR). In this paper we compare traditional access methods to a connectivity clustered access method, CCAM, which tries to achieve high WCRR. We also describe possible modifications to improve the WCRR achieved by existing spatial access methods. Experiments with network computations on the Minneapolis road-map show that CCAM performs best even though the proposed modifications substantially improve the performance of existing spatial access methods.

A simple implementation may use slope angles of the sweeping lines to be ifl180 l for i = 1::l, as suggested in <ref> [9] </ref>. We have tried various values for l and are currently using l = 5 plus the vertical sweep lines. Larger set of sweeping lines requires more computation time but gains only slight improvements of the performance.

Reference-contexts: There are attributes associated with the nodes and edges. In general, spatial networks can be represented in many different ways. We will focus on the adjacency-list oriented representation, which has been used quite frequently in database research <ref> [13] </ref>. In this representation, a spatial network is modeled as a list of nodes, and each node has an attribute named the successor-list, which represent the outgoing edges. Unlike point and range queries, network computations access data by connectivity and by traversal order.

Reference-contexts: Linear clustering based spatial access methods order the points in multiple dimensions by a space-filling curve, with a specific resolution of the space, and use a one-dimensional access method with this ordering. They perform transformations on higher-order keys to impose a total ordering. Example methods include Z-ordering <ref> [17] </ref> and Hilbert Curves [12, 2, 6]. Multidimensional B-trees [20] and K-dB-trees [18] establish a correspondence between the levels of the index and dimensions.

We also use a connectivity-based linear clustering method, DFS-ordering [4, 14]. Finally, we use a pure connectivity-based access method, CCAM [24]. <p> Since our focus is on clustering efficiencies, i.e. the number of data page accesses, any primary index or secondary index structure can be used to facilitate fast search. We use B + tree in our implementation. 3.2.1 Clustering by Z-order Z-order <ref> [17] </ref> utilizes spatial information while imposing a total order on the points. The Z-order of a coordinate x,y is computed by interleaving the bits in the binary representation of the two values. <p> Each data page is kept at least half full whenever possible. Records of the data file are not physically ordered by node-id values. An auxiliary secondary index (e.g. B + tree with key = Z-order (x,y) <ref> [17] </ref>) is used to support point retrieval operation like Find (). In general, update operations change connectivity relationships, and may make the existing partitioning of the network to pages obsolete. CCAM incorporates effective dynamic reclustering strategies to handle updates.

Reference-contexts: However, none of the topological ordering based access methods take full advantage of the connectivity properties of a network, due to their reliance on a total ordering of nodes. In <ref> [24] </ref>, we have proposed a connectivity-clustered access method, CCAM, to efficiently support aggregate queries over general networks such as road maps. CCAM is based on heuristic graph-partitioning approach to cluster the nodes of a given network into file pages by the connectivity relationship. <p> Ideally, CCAM maximizes WCRR, the chance that a pair of connected nodes is allocated to a common page of the file. The procedures to implement the network operations for CCAM are described in <ref> [24] </ref> along with incremental reorganization strategies. Alternative implementations of CCAM are evaluated as well. In this paper, we focus on a comparative performance study of access methods for network computations over spatial networks. <p> of accessing an edge and the expected cost of network operations are minimized by maximizing the Weighted Connectivity Residue Ratio (WCRR), where WCRR = Sum of w (u; v) such that Page (u) = Page (v) Total sum of weights over all edges : Proof: The proof is available in <ref> [24] </ref>. 2 The weight, w (u; v), associated with edge (u; v) represents the relative frequency of a query accessing nodes u and v together. <p> Two methods of linear clustering are used in our research. The first method, Z-ordering [17], represents a spatial-based linear transformation of two-dimensional data. We also use a connectivity-based linear clustering method, DFS-ordering [4, 14]. Finally, we use a pure connectivity-based access method, CCAM <ref> [24] </ref>. Connectivity-based access methods are chosen since the topology connectivity is the main characteristics of spatial networks. 3.1 Spatial Methods 3.1.1 Grid File The grid file [16] partitions the data space according to an orthogonal grid. <p> DFS is not the only method to linearly cluster data based on connectivity. We have also tried the Breadth First Search (BFS) solution. However, our results indicate that BFS performs much worse than DFS. We therefore only re port results from the DFS implementation. 4 3.3 CCAM The CCAM <ref> [24] </ref> is based on a heuristic graph-partitioning approach to cluster the nodes of a given network into file pages by the connectivity relationship. Ideally, the clustering maximizes WCRR. CCAM is designed to efficiently support Find (), Get-A-successor (), Get-successors (), Insert () and Delete () operations on spatial networks.

Network analysis represents frequent queries on spatial networks, such as route evaluation, network overlay and path optimization <ref> [26] </ref>, etc. Route evaluation is concerned with aggregating attribute data over route-units. A route-unit represents a collection of arcs with common characteristics (e.g. name) [15]. Route evaluation yields summary information for decision-support applications. <p> Route evaluation for daily commuters of 1 Also known as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ten consists of comparing a set of familiar routes based on the current travel-time, congestion, restrictions and other attributes of the transportation networks. Other interesting problems in network analysis includes path optimization <ref> [15, 26, 11] </ref>, which models problems, such as shortest path analysis, optimum tour routing, etc. 1.2 Related Work and Our Contributions We discuss some of the existing access methods, including proximity-based spatial access methods and connectivity-based access methods, which may be adapted for spatial network databases.
