Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation Fuzzy Logic Controllers In the twenty years that have passed since the publication of the landmark papers <ref> [1] </ref> and [3], there has been an explosion in the development of the theory and application of fuzzy logic to control systems [4]-[18]. In most cases the rule base of the fuzzy logic controller is specified by considering the desired closed loop behavior of the system. <p> Associated with each fuzzy set is a membership function. These functions can be thought of as maps F i j from the real numbers (where the quantities w i live) to the unit interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. They determine to what extend the label associated with the fuzzy set j characterizes the current value of the quantity w i . <p> Under this formalism fuzzification of the quantity w i becomes equivalent to applying all the maps F i j ; j = 1; : : : ; n i to it. We can write this symbolically as: F i : &lt; ! I n i <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi : : : fi [0; 1] 2 6 p i . . . n i 7 5 = 6 4 1 (w i ) F i 3 7 Hence a fuzzy vector is associated to each quantity. <p> We can write this symbolically as: F i : &lt; ! I n i <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi : : : fi [0; 1] 2 6 p i . . . n i 7 5 = 6 4 1 (w i ) F i 3 7 Hence a fuzzy vector is associated to each quantity. <p> We assume this is the case here as, without loss of generality, we can always scale all the functions by a fixed number so that all the ranges lie in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 3 2.1.3 Firing or Inference Rules The firing rules form the heart of a fuzzy model.

Reference-contexts: We can now use this representation to design controller rule base for regulation. Given the plant automaton, the task is to design a rule based controller which will produce acceptable closed loop behavior. We can cast this as a discrete event supervisor design problem (see <ref> [19] </ref> for details) in the following way: all the events we have considered 2 so far (choice of inputs), are controllable in terms of Ramadge-Wonham theory of [19]. (i.e. you can block/disable them at any given time). <p> We can cast this as a discrete event supervisor design problem (see <ref> [19] </ref> for details) in the following way: all the events we have considered 2 so far (choice of inputs), are controllable in terms of Ramadge-Wonham theory of [19].

Reference-contexts: This is equivalent to finding [( Q m j=1 n u j ) 1] events (control choices) at every state which should be blocked by the controller. By using Ramadge-Wonham theory we can check the existence of a supervisor to accomplish the control task. Algorithms exists in the literature <ref> [20, 21] </ref> to design supervisors for discrete event dynamical systems. 3.2 Regulation For regulation, we are interested in finding out the sequence of inputs which will take the system from the initial state to the final state. The final state may represent the set point.

Reference-contexts: If the initial state q 0 of the plant automaton is fixed, then we can use COSPAN to get a control trace that will take the plant state from q 0 to F . COSPAN is a software program <ref> [22] </ref>, that is used for verification of regular languages. In this case, we can enter the `uncontrolled' plant state machine in COSPAN, define the task to be `never visit the final state'.
