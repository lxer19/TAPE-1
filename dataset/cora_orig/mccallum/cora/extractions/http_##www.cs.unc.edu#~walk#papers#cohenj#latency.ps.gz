Title: Combatting Rendering Latency

Abstract: Latency or lag in an interactive graphics system is the delay between user input and displayed output. We have found latency and the apparent bobbing and swimming of objects that it produces to be a serious problem for head-mounted display (HMD) and augmented reality applications. At UNC, we have been investigating a number of ways to reduce latency; we present two of these. Slats is an experimental rendering system for our Pixel-Planes 5 graphics machine guaranteeing a constant single NTSC field of latency. This guaranteed response is especially important for predictive tracking. Just-in-time pixels is an attempt to compensate for rendering latency by rendering the pixels in a scanned display based on their position in the scan.
