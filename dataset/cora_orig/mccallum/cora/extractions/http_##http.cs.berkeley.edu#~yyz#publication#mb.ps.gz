Abstract: This paper introduces a kind of new wavelet radiosity method called multiresolution B-spline radiosity, which uses B-splines of different scales to represent radiosity distribution functions. A set of techniques and algorithms, such as function extrapolation, adaptive quadrature, scale adjustment and octree, are proposed to implement it. This method sets up hierarchical structures on surfaces, keeps radiosity distribution continuous at element boundaries, does not need postprocessing, and does not prevent the use of any surface whose parameter domain is rectilinear.

Reference-contexts: Error computations for a single energy transfer between parallel and perpendicular squares is used to indicate the accuracy of the method of this paper. All comparisons are made against an analytic formula advocated in <ref> [7] </ref>. The relative error metric used is rea = jB spline (s; t) B exact (s; t)j B exact (s; t) (29) where the error is evaluated on a 256 by 256 grid of sample points on the receiving surface. Shooting and receiving squares are the same size.

Reference-contexts: The ways of rendering and back face removal are trivial and are left out in this paper. 7 Experimental Results In order to obtain good visual effects, we should use third or even higher order B-spline basis,which has continuous first order derivative, to approximate radiosity distribution. <ref> [15] </ref> only gives some images using first and second order wavelet bases. On the other hand, wavelet radiosity adopts hierarchical subdivision. Each basis function only covers a local area. So low order basis is able to achieve good approximation. We feel 3rd or 4th order basis is enough. <p> All these pictures are rendered without any postprocessing. (a) (b) 8 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we have presented a new wavelet radiosity method called multiresolution B-spline radios-ity which is basically different from that introduced in <ref> [15] </ref>. We also proposed a set of new techniques and algorithms to implement it. 12 Our method is essentially hierarchical. Theoretically, it has linear time complexity. It has overcome the problem of blocky artifacts at element boundaries [15] and keeps radiosity distribution continuous at these locations. It uses progressive refinement. <p> method called multiresolution B-spline radios-ity which is basically different from that introduced in <ref> [15] </ref>.

On different surfaces in an environment, different B-spline bases can be used. Our algorithm does not require albedo to be constant over a surface.

Reference-contexts: Octree An octree is built before radiosity computation to accelerate the test of ray-object intersection during shadow computation. It is not a linear octree and similar to those introduced in <ref> [16] </ref>, stored as a tree structure with its nodes linked by pointers. Each node in the octree represents a cube in the object space.

Reference-contexts: And superposition can be easily performed. However, better methods are needed to handle intersections between curved surfaces, accelerate convergence of quadrature at these intersections and improve shadow computation. To environments made up of planar objects, the preprocessing introduced in <ref> [17] </ref> can be used to accelerate testing ray-object intersection. Topological ralations of surfaces could be set up [18] to improve efficiency of computation at surface boundaries. They also may be helpful to keep radiosity distribution continuous at boundaries between coplanar surfaces.
