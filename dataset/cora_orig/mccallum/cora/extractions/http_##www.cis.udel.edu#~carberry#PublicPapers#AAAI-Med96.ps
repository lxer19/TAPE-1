Reference-contexts: Introduction Early AIM research recognized the potential for using the knowledge base of a medical decision support system for training and testing students. Clancey <ref> [1] </ref> took on the entire task of restructuring both MYCIN's knowledge base and its reasoning methods to do this. <p> Most of these simulations, such as those described in <ref> [1, 3, 5] </ref>, rely on knowledge bases that detail the manifestations associated with each disease along with their frequencies of occurrence; cases are generated by randomly selecting manifestations for inclusion in the case, with the manifestation's probability of inclusion determined by its frequency of occurrence.

Reference-contexts: Our method for generating cases relies on chaining backwards through selected rules, and we believe that it can be extended to generate cases that are dynamically adapted to the student's individual needs. Eliot and Woolf <ref> [4] </ref> developed a somewhat different approach to producing simulated cases. Their system works in the domain of cardiac resuscitation, and a simulation consists of a series of transitions between states of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.

Reference-contexts: We are seeking to identify principles that apply generally to case generation. However, to ground and implement our ideas, we have applied them to trauma care and have developed a system that generates cases by reasoning on the knowledge base of TraumAID <ref> [6] </ref>, a decision support system for addressing the initial definitive management of multiple trauma. Traum-AID's three part knowledge base is encoded declaratively and contains extensive medical knowledge related to trauma care.
