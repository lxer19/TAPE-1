Reference-contexts: Beigel [2] and Toda [26] showed that if a NP- P tt -hard set is P-selective then P=FewP and NP=RP. Thierauf, Toda and Watanabe [24] showed that if a NP- P btt -hard set is P-selective then NP DTIME (2 n O (1= p ). Agrawal and Arvind <ref> [1] </ref>, Beigel, Kummer and Stephan [3], and Ogiwara [17] independently proved that if a NP- P btt -hard set is P-selective, then P=NP.

Reference-contexts: It has attracted a great deal of interest and have been many advances in understanding P-selectivity.

It has attracted a great deal of interest and have been many advances in understanding P-selectivity.

Reference-contexts: If there exists a polynomial p (n) such that k A n k&lt; p (n) for all n, then we say A is sparse. "SPARSE" represents the class of all sparse languages. 2 Hartmanis <ref> [11] </ref> introduced a "generalized Kolmogorov complexity measure". We employ this tool in the proof of our theorems. We consider standard deterministic time- bounded Turing machines that act as transducers. We assume a standard enumeration of such transducers, say N 1 ; N 2 ; .

The class of languages that are polynomial time Turing reducible to P-selective sets are the same as P/poly <ref> [20] </ref>. Separating complexity class from P/poly is one of the most fundamental problems in complexity theory. It is still open if NEXP 6P/poly. The line of research about the consequence of NP sets reducing to a P-selective set is very active in the recent years. <p> For a language A, A (x) is the characteristic function of A. N = f0; 1; 2; g. For real number x, bxc is the largest integer x.
