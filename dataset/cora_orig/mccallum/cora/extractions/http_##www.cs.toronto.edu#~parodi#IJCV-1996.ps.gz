Reference-contexts: The first step (labeling) is meant to provide a qualitative description of the scene, by classifying the segments of the line drawing as the projection of convex, concave or contour edges. Labeling was introduced by Huffman <ref> [1] </ref> and Clowes [2], who focused on the case of trihedral scenes (exactly three planar surfaces meeting at every vertex). Their work was then generalized to richer worlds and richer representations (see [3, 4, 5, 6] and Section 2.4 of this paper). <p> This section attempts to give a very brief review of the past work in the field. 2.1 The linguistic approach to labeling. In 1971 Huffman <ref> [1] </ref> and Clowes [2] made the first attempts to attach the problem of extracting 3D information from a line drawing from a computational standpoint. They both found an important necessary condition (labelability) for the realizability of a line drawing as the orthographic or perspective projection of a polyhedral scene. <p> Some words about gradient space, which has been one of the most influential tools in the theory of line drawings, should be spent. It was introduced by Mackworth [31] as an elaboration of some observations by Huffman <ref> [1] </ref> on the properties of dual space. <p> for a junction to be realizable as the projection of a 3D vertex constructed as in Section 3.1, the segments belonging to a junction must be labeled according to the junction dictionary of Fig. 4; the labeled junctions put in a frame are also realizable in the trihedral world (Huffman <ref> [1] </ref>, Clowes [2])). A legal labeling is the assignment of a label to every segment of the line drawing such that every junction is labeled according to the dictionary of Fig.4. The labeling (or labelability) problem is the problem of determining whether a legal labeling exists.

Their work was then generalized to richer worlds and richer representations (see <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref> and Section 2.4 of this paper). The second step (realization) is finding a realization of the labeled line drawing, that is recovering the 3D structure of the depicted scene (Sugihara [7], [8], [9]). More recently, many efforts have been concentrated on complexity issues. <p> The labeling problem has therefore been reduced to the satisfiability problem for a boolean expression (SAT). Observe that this is an inefficient method, as SAT is N P-complete. 2.2 Labeling as constraint satisfaction. Other methods have been proposed for labeling a line drawing. Waltz <ref> [3] </ref> exhibited a filtering algorithm with very good average running time (roughly linear in the number of segments). <p> But even adding the information on depth the existence of a dual figure remains a necessary but not sufficient condition for realizability (see Draper [32]). 2.4 Origami world. Many attempts have been made to extend the labeling scheme to richer worlds or richer representations. Waltz <ref> [3] </ref> increased the world to include shadows and cracks; Sugihara [4] analyzed the case in which the line drawing included lines depicting visible edges; Kanade [5] extended the world to include Origami structures, that is objects made of paper (or planar panels) as in the traditional Japanese art. <p> In order to obtain a consistent labeling, Kanade used constraint relaxation (as in Waltz <ref> [3] </ref>) followed by tree searching. In addition to this, he used gradient space as a tool for achieving a more global consistency of surface orientations than the one assured by simple labeling. The method is as follows.

More recently, many efforts have been concentrated on complexity issues. <p> This paper studies the computational complexity of the labeling problem for line drawings of Origami scenes, that is scenes obtained by assembling planar panels of negligible thickness. This world of objects has been called Origami in <ref> [5] </ref> for its resemblance to the traditional Japanese art of cutting and folding sheets of paper. <p> Many attempts have been made to extend the labeling scheme to richer worlds or richer representations. Waltz [3] increased the world to include shadows and cracks; Sugihara [4] analyzed the case in which the line drawing included lines depicting visible edges; Kanade <ref> [5] </ref> extended the world to include Origami structures, that is objects made of paper (or planar panels) as in the traditional Japanese art. <p> The extension to Origami objects seems particularly important, as many line drawings which have been 6 obtained from real images often fail to depict the thickness of thin objects. The Origami world seems therefore to offer a better modelization of the actual world. In Kanade <ref> [5] </ref>, objects are generated by combining planar panels of negligible thickness so that no more than three surfaces of different orientations meet at a vertex, and that no more than three edges of different orientations are involved at a vertex. <p> panels so that at most three planar surfaces and at most three edges can meet at a vertex (as in minimal Origami), but where edges may be shared only partially and two panels may touch along a line which is an edge only for one of the two panels (see <ref> [5] </ref>). The minimal Origami world has been chosen for its simplicity, but the results of this paper can be easily generalized to richer versions (see Appendix E for a discussion on this point). <p> In Kanade <ref> [5] </ref>, the junction dictionary for the Origami world is augmented with constraints in the gradient space that must be satisfied by the planar panels meeting at a junction (see Section 2.4). <p> The most classical example of an Origami line drawing (see Kanade <ref> [5] </ref>) is maybe the box of Fig. 8. If no information on the vanishing points is available, a labeling can be obtained by constraint relaxation and it yields 65 possible different legal labelings which have to be tested against Sugihara's procedure. <p> The Origami world was first studied by Kanade <ref> [5] </ref> by relaxation techniques. No complexity analysis was carried out in [5], but the relaxation approach 30 to labeling is now known to be computationally inefficient in general. The number of legal interpretations to check against realizability, too, was huge (see [38]). <p> The Origami world was first studied by Kanade <ref> [5] </ref> by relaxation techniques. No complexity analysis was carried out in [5], but the relaxation approach 30 to labeling is now known to be computationally inefficient in general. The number of legal interpretations to check against realizability, too, was huge (see [38]). This paper has analyzed a restricted version of the Origami world, which has been called minimal Origami world. <p> The same leading principle was applied by Kanade <ref> [5] </ref> in his work on the Origami world, by Kirousis [37] to the labeling problem for trihedral objects, and by Dendris et al. [42] to the labeling problem for the Pottery world. <p> The gadget of Fig. 14 (C) represents a clause. 2 E Relaxing the assumptions on the Origami world The minimal Origami world studied in this paper is different from the one considered by Kanade, who described in <ref> [5] </ref> a world which can be obtained by assembling planar panels with the only constraint that at most three planar surfaces and at most three edges can meet at a vertex.

More recently, many efforts have been concentrated on complexity issues. <p> Even this approach to labeling, however, is worst-case exponential. The CSP approach is now the standard one used for labeling line drawings. It has been applied to line drawings of polyhedral as well as curved line objects (see Malik <ref> [6] </ref>). Although this approach is in general worst-case exponential, in several meaningful cases the constraints are of a kind which allows unique propagation rules for the constraints and efficient sequential and parallel algorithms (Kirousis [23]). 2.3 The gradient space. <p> Malik <ref> [6] </ref> considered the case of curved objects, enriching the set of labels to include the case of limbs (lines where a surface occludes itself by smoothly changing orientation). Let us take a closer look at Kanade's work.

Reference-contexts: Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref> have found that this is not true, by showing that the labeling problem is N P-complete even for the simple case of trihedral, solid scenes, but has polynomial complexity for line drawings of Legoland scenes (3D edges with three possible orthogonal directions). <p> This procedure is therefore highly inefficient. Is the realizability problem actually intractable, or are we just adopting the wrong approach? Intuitively speaking, one would guess that the correct answer is the latter, due to the ease with which the brain solves the problem. In 1988, however, Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref> proved that both the labeling and the realizability problem are N P -complete, and therefore presumably intractable, even for the simple case of trihedral scenes. <p> Several efforts have already been done toward this goal. Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref> found that orthographic projections of Legoland scenes (that is, scenes with physical edges oriented only according to three orthogonal directions, which are supposed to be known) can be labeled in polynomial time. <p> The interested reader is referred to Appendix D. Proposition 1 It is N P-complete to tell whether a line drawing can be labeled as the perspective (or orthographic) projection of an Origami scene. 15 Proof. Reduction from PLANAR-SAT (3,5) (see Appendix B) as in <ref> [10] </ref>. The labeling problem for trihedral scenes, which is N P-complete in the general case, becomes polynomially solvable once the location of the vanishing points in the image plane is given (see [12]). <p> Proposition 2 It is N P-complete to determine whether a line drawing can be labeled as the perspective projection of an Origami scene even though the location of the vanishing points in the image plane is known. Proof. Reduction from PLANAR-SAT (3,5) (see Appendix B) as in <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 The paneling approach to the labeling prob lem Even though the labeling problem is N P-complete, knowing the location of the vanishing points provides an inestimable information on the 3D structure of the scene, that can be used to reduce drastically the number of possible interpretations of a given <p> If an interpretation can be found, it is unique up to a number of scaling factors whose number equals the number of objects in the scene (this result generalizes the one obtained by Kirousis and Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref> for 27 line drawings of Manhattan scenes). The procedure is not only conceptually simpler but also has lower (polynomial) complexity and is numerically stable. <p> The labeling problem is known to be a special case of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), which is in general N P-complete. The labeling problem for line drawings of trihedral scenes, which is far more constrained than the general CSP, is still N P-complete (Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref>). The labeling problem for line drawings of Origami scenes is, intuitively speaking, of intermediate difficulty between these two cases. <p> Step (b) can be solved in polynomial time [7], whereas Step (a) is intractable in the general case <ref> [10] </ref>. Step (a), however, becomes polynomial once the vanishing points are given [12]. In the case of Origami line drawings, this scheme holds even for the labeling step: now Step (a) is paneling and Step (b) is labeling a paneled line drawing. <p> As for completeness, a reduction from PLANAR-SAT (3,5) (see Appendix A) by component design (see Garey & 45 Johnson (1979)) will be used, as in Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref>. Given a suitable formula F in 3-CNF line drawing L a line drawing will be constructed which is labelable if-f F is satisfiable. We will construct components working as variables and clauses. The fundamental components are shown in Fig. 13 (A 1 ) and 13 (B 1 ). <p> It is now trivial to construct the line drawing L associated with the proposition F by properly assembling the components together. For more details on the construction see the analogous procedure (with different components, of course) followed by Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [10] </ref>. 2 Now let us consider the case of given vanishing points 6 . The following lemma is useful for proving Proposition 2.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of past research in the interpretation of line drawings. <p> Dendris et al. [42] have shown that the labeling problem becomes tractable for a world of arbitrarily intersecting and overlaying (curved) objects each obtained by rotating arbitrary polygons around arbitrary axes (Pottery world). Parodi & Torre <ref> [12] </ref> have shown that, if the vanishing points are given, it is useful to postulate that the following geometrical event is non-accidental: if a segment converges on a vanishing point, the corresponding edge actually has the direction associated with the vanishing point; such non-accidental regularity is not affected by occlusion and <p> Reduction from PLANAR-SAT (3,5) (see Appendix B) as in [10]. The labeling problem for trihedral scenes, which is N P-complete in the general case, becomes polynomially solvable once the location of the vanishing points in the image plane is given (see <ref> [12] </ref>). Proposition 2 states that this result cannot be extended to the case of Origami scenes, despite the remarkable amount of information that the knowledge on vanishing points implies. <p> Y (): a Y-junction whose connecting segments must be labeled "". Of course, the above classification cannot be carried out in general, with no information on the orientation of the planes meeting at the junction. Such classification is possible, however, for trihedral scenes, if vanishing points are given <ref> [12] </ref>, and the extension of this result to line drawings of Origami scenes is trivial. As in [12], it is here assumed, for obvious geometrical reasons, that the vanishing points associated with a Y- or E-junctions are not collinear. <p> Such classification is possible, however, for trihedral scenes, if vanishing points are given <ref> [12] </ref>, and the extension of this result to line drawings of Origami scenes is trivial. As in [12], it is here assumed, for obvious geometrical reasons, that the vanishing points associated with a Y- or E-junctions are not collinear. <p> Although this argument cannot be used as a proof of the N P -completeness of the labeling problem for Origami line drawings, it explains why the result of Proposition 1 should have been expected. Parodi & Torre <ref> [12] </ref> found that the labeling problem for trihedral scenes (which is N P-complete) becomes polynomially solvable once the location of the vanishing points is given. This work is born as an attempt to extend the results and the methods of [12] to the world of Origami. <p> Parodi & Torre <ref> [12] </ref> found that the labeling problem for trihedral scenes (which is N P-complete) becomes polynomially solvable once the location of the vanishing points is given. This work is born as an attempt to extend the results and the methods of [12] to the world of Origami. Proposition 2 shows that this program cannot be thoroughly realized. Unlike the N P -completeness result of Proposition 1, the result of Proposition 2 is rather unexpected. <p> Step (b) can be solved in polynomial time [7], whereas Step (a) is intractable in the general case [10]. Step (a), however, becomes polynomial once the vanishing points are given <ref> [12] </ref>. In the case of Origami line drawings, this scheme holds even for the labeling step: now Step (a) is paneling and Step (b) is labeling a paneled line drawing.

Reference-contexts: the fact that the vanishing points can often be extracted from the image itself by standard techniques, for both computer-made and real-world images (see Straforini et al.[13], Collins & Weiss [14], Brillault & O'Mahony [15], Nakatani & Kitahashi [16], Barnard [17], Quan & Mohr [18], Horaud [19], Magee & Aggarwal <ref> [20] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: To label a line drawing, first achieve this local consistency and then achieve global consistency by tree searching with backtracking. The work on line drawings has stimulated the analysis of a more general problem, the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP; see Mackworth & Freuder <ref> [21] </ref> for a retrospective): we have a set of variables X 1 ; : : : X n each of which may assume a finite set of values, and there is a set of relations of the kind "value a of variable X i is compatible with value b of variable

Reference-contexts: Labeling is a special case of CSP. Waltz' procedure can be used to solve this problem and is called, in this framework, "arc consistency". The reason why the algorithm performed with linear average running time is that achieving arc consistency takes indeed linear time (see Mackworth <ref> [22] </ref>), and it is often the case that at the end of the relaxation procedure only a few segments are not uniquely labeled. Even this approach to labeling, however, is worst-case exponential. The CSP approach is now the standard one used for labeling line drawings.

Reference-contexts: Although this approach is in general worst-case exponential, in several meaningful cases the constraints are of a kind which allows unique propagation rules for the constraints and efficient sequential and parallel algorithms (Kirousis <ref> [23] </ref>). 2.3 The gradient space. As it was clear from the start, labelability is only a necessary condition for a line drawing to be realizable as the projection of a polyhedral scene.

Reference-contexts: But even adding the information on depth the existence of a dual figure remains a necessary but not sufficient condition for realizability (see Draper <ref> [32] </ref>). 2.4 Origami world. Many attempts have been made to extend the labeling scheme to richer worlds or richer representations. <p> Like all other approaches making use of the gradient space, the test on geometrical plausibility is incomplete in the sense that a line drawing which passes the test may still be non-realizable. 2.5 Sugihara's approach to realizability.

He also proposed some qualitative criteria for discovering impossibilities (sidedness reasoning) without having to employ the full power of Linear Programming, regarding it to be little appealing to intuition, but did not find a sufficient condition for realizability.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case it can end in an L-junction, and it must end when the foot of a T-junction is reached. Several conditions for the 3D realizability of paneled walks can be given (see for example Shapira <ref> [33] </ref> on the properties of line assemblies), which may help restrict the number of labelings to be considered for the realizability test, but we are specially interested in stating this geometrically evident rule that will be very useful in the proof of Proposition 1: 44 Lemma 6 Two distinct (maximal) paneled

Reference-contexts: Several efforts have already been done toward this goal. Kirousis & Papadimitriou [10] found that orthographic projections of Legoland scenes (that is, scenes with physical edges oriented only according to three orthogonal directions, which are supposed to be known) can be labeled in polynomial time. Kirousis <ref> [37] </ref> has shown that the labeling problem becomes linear if for each Y-junction of the line drawing we know a priori at least one connecting segment, i.e. a segment whose label can either be "+" or "". <p> The labeling (or labelability) problem is the problem of determining whether a legal labeling exists. This concept of labeling can be extended. In Kirousis <ref> [37] </ref> it is required that the labeling be such that not only all junctions be realizable as the projection of trihedral 3D vertices, but that all L-chains (that is, maximal chains of adjacent segments pairwise forming L-junctions) be realizable as the projection of (a portion of) a trihedral scene. 14 This <p> The same leading principle was applied by Kanade [5] in his work on the Origami world, by Kirousis <ref> [37] </ref> to the labeling problem for trihedral objects, and by Dendris et al. [42] to the labeling problem for the Pottery world. <p> This is due to the fact that all the additional constraints can be checked in time O (N ), where N is the number of segments. Constraints on collinear segments In Kirousis <ref> [37] </ref> the following lemma was proved: Lemma 1 If two segments in the image plane converge on the same vanishing point, then they are projections of parallel edges. Also, if two segments are collinear then they are projections of collinear edges. <p> Also, if two segments are collinear then they are projections of collinear edges. The proof made only use of the general position assumption. The lemma was used in <ref> [37] </ref> to prove that collinear segments in a chain of L-junctions must be assigned the same label. This can be slightly generalized to the following lemma, implicit in the work of Kirousis [37]: Lemma 2 Two collinear segments dividing the same two polygons must be assigned the same label. <p> The proof made only use of the general position assumption.

Reference-contexts: The multiplicity of labelings is addressed in Section 5. As for the problem of the uniqueness of shapes, consider for example Fig. 2, which is borrowed by Kanade <ref> [38] </ref> and is put in the perspective projection version. The `natural' interpretation of Fig. 2 (A) is a cube, while that of Fig. 2 (B) is a trapezoid. Observe that (A) and (B) have the same set of legal labelings. <p> The Origami world was first studied by Kanade [5] by relaxation techniques. No complexity analysis was carried out in [5], but the relaxation approach 30 to labeling is now known to be computationally inefficient in general. The number of legal interpretations to check against realizability, too, was huge (see <ref> [38] </ref>). This paper has analyzed a restricted version of the Origami world, which has been called minimal Origami world. <p> although there may be, in general, exponentially many legal panelings to test against labelability, this number is usually very small, and so is the number of legal labelings (see Section 5.2). 32 5.2 Relevance to Computer Vision and Artificial In- telligence As it has been noted, for example, by Kanade <ref> [38] </ref>, line drawings of solid objects can often fail to depict their width (see Kanade [38]) when the line drawing is obtained by processing a real image. <p> number is usually very small, and so is the number of legal labelings (see Section 5.2). 32 5.2 Relevance to Computer Vision and Artificial In- telligence As it has been noted, for example, by Kanade <ref> [38] </ref>, line drawings of solid objects can often fail to depict their width (see Kanade [38]) when the line drawing is obtained by processing a real image. The trihedral world assumption ([1], [2]) is therefore often inadequate to describe the objects of a polyhedral scene, and the Origami assumption answers the need of a more suitable modelization of the object world. <p> The use of vanishing points has another advantage. As Kanade put it in his retrospective on the problem (see <ref> [38] </ref>), the labeling does not really specify the shape: several different quantitative shapes may correspond to the same labeled line drawing, despite the fact that humans usually think of only one interpretation.

Reference-contexts: In an effort to understand the mechanism by which some physically plausible but counter-intuitive interpretations are discarded by the brain, Kanade 11 <ref> [39, 40] </ref> introduced the principle of non-accidental regularities, according to which regular image properties, such as collinearity and parallelism (in orthographic projection), are not accidental but come from regularities in the 3D scene.

Reference-contexts: Kanade defined an important class of non-accidental regularities, which he called skew symmetries, namely symmetries along a line which is not perpendicular to the symmetrical axis. This class of symmetries has been generalized to the perspective case by Ulupinar and Nevatia <ref> [41] </ref>, who introduced the convergent symmetries. Postulating that a skewed (convergent) symmetry depicts a real symmetry viewed from some unknown view angle results in useful constraints in gradient space, which imply that 2 (A) must indeed be a cube and 2 (B) must be a trapezoid.

Reference-contexts: The use of symmetries and regularities seems a promising approach to reconstruction and recognition problems, and one which is biologically plausible. Dendris et al. <ref> [42] </ref> have shown that the labeling problem becomes tractable for a world of arbitrarily intersecting and overlaying (curved) objects each obtained by rotating arbitrary polygons around arbitrary axes (Pottery world). <p> The same leading principle was applied by Kanade [5] in his work on the Origami world, by Kirousis [37] to the labeling problem for trihedral objects, and by Dendris et al. <ref> [42] </ref> to the labeling problem for the Pottery world. It can be easily proved that by imposing such additional constraints on labeling (that is, checking these additional constraints before testing the labeled line drawing against Sugihara's procedure) the complexity of the realizabil-ity algorithm is not increased.

Reference-contexts: If f has equation aX + bY + cZ + d = 0 in the space, the horizon line has equation ax + by + cf = 0 in the image plane, where f is the focal length. The following property (see <ref> [44] </ref>) is at the bottom of the proof of Proposition 2 and of the paneling and labeling algorithm: Property The vanishing points associated with three unit vectors are collinear if-f the three unit vectors are coplanar. The properties of perspective projection allow a sharper classification of junctions.

Reference-contexts: The relation between the horizon line and the orientation of the planar face is straightforward (see Section 4.1). Another approach can be found in Parodi & Piccioli <ref> [45] </ref>, where the realizability and realization problem for general scenes with planar surfaces is reduced to the problem of finding the positive cycles in a directed weighted graph. <p> As a consequence, the shape of all objects in the scene can be quantitatively reconstructed in a unique way by a simplified version of Sugihara's algorithm (see Parodi & Piccioli <ref> [45] </ref>). The results of this paper, therefore, substantiate the contention that geometrical regularities must play a fundamental role in a biologically plausible algorithm for interpreting line drawings. Acknowledgements Prof. V. Torre suggested that I should analyze the complexity of understanding Origami line drawings, and helped me with advice and discussion.
