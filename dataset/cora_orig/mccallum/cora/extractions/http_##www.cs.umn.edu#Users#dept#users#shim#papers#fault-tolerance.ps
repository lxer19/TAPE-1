Title: High Availability in Fault-Tolerant Video Servers  
Author: David H.C. Du, Yuewei Wang and Simon Shim 
Affiliation: Distributed Multimedia Research Center Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota  
Abstract: Due to the large number of disks involved in a video server, fault-tolerance is an important issue. Trandi-tional parity and duplex based approaches provide the data redundancy but do not guarantee the full availability of the service in the presence of even a single disk failure. If a video server would like to provide non-disruptable service to a large number of viewers, the issue of high availability needs to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel redundancy scheme called Shifting Redundancy With Cyclic Permutation (SR-WCP) which provides both high availability and data redundancy. We also show that the proposed scheme can be used to trade-off memory buffer space and the disk storage space in a video server.

Reference-contexts: stream intends to access the failed disk unless all the required data blocks are prefetched. mode In order to eliminate the performance hiccup, one can use n buffers for each stream to cache all the data blocks of the first parity group before starting to display the first data block <ref> [1] </ref> as shown in Figure 5. Afterwards each data block is read in to replace the data block which is just displayed. If a disk fails, the currently required data block on the failed disk is already in the buffers.

Reference-contexts: In effect, SDW P BD is a special case of this scheme when n = 1, while RAID-4 is a special case too when m = 1. Berson and et al. proposed a scheme called Improved Bandwidth (IB) by shifting parity to the right in <ref> [2] </ref>. In their scheme, if a disk failures occurs, its load is shifted to the cluster on the right whose load is in turn shifted to the right until a lightly loaded cluster is found.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a storage system should provide protection against the data loss due to disk failures and should still function gracefully with little performance degradation even when a disk fails. There have been quite a number of proposals for data layout and scheduling algorithms in video servers <ref> [23, 22, 21, 17, 3, 13, 7, 6, 24] </ref>. However, studies on fault-tolerance in video servers are quite limited in comparison. Tranditionally, striping technique are used to provide enough I/O bandwidth for a large number of concurrent streams to a single video or to provide the flexibility of concurrent accesses.

Reference-contexts: In order to achieve higher availability in the fault mode, it may be feasible to trade in more data redundancy with availability. There are a few proposed schemes <ref> [4, 19] </ref> in video servers with a higher level of data redundancy and a better service availability when a single disk failure occurs. <p> Another way of achieving load-balancing in the fault mode is to reconstruct each striping data block on the failed disk by retrieving 1=n striping data blocks from each of the surviving disks. This approach is based on interleaved declustering [5] or Segmented Information Dispersal (SID) <ref> [4] </ref>. Figure 9 shows the basic idea. Here, each striping data block is partition into 4 small sub-striping data blocks. Each of the duplex striping data block consists of 4 small sub-striping data blocks one from each of the 4 surviving disks.

Reference-contexts: A scheme which stripes video over all the disks is called wide striping. One of the disadvantages of wide striping is that a single disk failure will affect a large number of concurrent accesses. To deal with disk failures, parity based or parity checking techniques <ref> [16] </ref> are adopted to protect against data losses. In RAID [16], a parity block is constructed with every 5 or 6 data blocks (one from each disk). RAID and wide striping are commonly used in video servers to distributed the load imposed by video streams evenly across all the disks. <p> One of the disadvantages of wide striping is that a single disk failure will affect a large number of concurrent accesses.

In RAID [16], a parity block is constructed with every 5 or 6 data blocks (one from each disk). RAID and wide striping are commonly used in video servers to distributed the load imposed by video streams evenly across all the disks. <p> Duplex-based redundancy schemes used the replication data on different disks to substitute the data on the failed disk in the fault mode. We will discuss these two types of redundancy schemes in the next two subsections. 2.1 Parity Based Fault-Tolerant Schemes Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disk (RAID) <ref> [16] </ref> uses data redundancy (parity checking) to provide fault tolerance against disk failures. Very often RAID and disk striping are used together. Among all the RAID configurations, RAID-3 and RAID-5 are widely used in practice. x:y in the same rectangle denotes striping piece y of slice x. <p> In order to provide the deterministic guarantee in the fault mode, one can use a backup disk to store the parity of the striping data blocks on the same row, as shown in Figure 10. This kind of striping is referred as RAID-4 in <ref> [16] </ref>. In this scheme, if one disk fails, the load of that disk is shifted completely to the back-up disk (Disk 5) with no performance degradation.
