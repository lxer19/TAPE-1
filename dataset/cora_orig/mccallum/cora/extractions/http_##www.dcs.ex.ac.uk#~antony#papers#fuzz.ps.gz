Title: An Investigation of "Non-intermingling" Principles in Temporal Logic  
Author: Antony Galton 
Address: Exeter EX4 4PT, U.K.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Exeter  
Abstract: In formalising temporal reasoning, should a proposition be allowed to change its truth value infinitely often over a finite period of time? It has been widely felt that for many types of proposition this phenomenon, which following Hamblin we call "intermingling", should be outlawed. In this paper we systematically examine the varieties of intermingling, distinguishing intermingling over an interval from intermingling at an instant. We survey the axioms that have been proposed in the literature to rule out intermingling, and determine precisely which varieties of intermingling are ruled out by which axioms. We distinguish "weak" non-intermingling principles, which only rule out one or two forms of intermingling, from "strong" non-intermingling principles which rule out all or most forms of intermingling. We show that none of the first-order solutions in the literature suffices to rule out all forms of intermingling, though a second-order solution can do so.

Reference-contexts: For a Boolean fluent , we shall write At (; t) to say that holds at instant t On (; i) to say that holds throughout interval i. (So On (; i) is the same as the Holds (; i) of <ref> [1] </ref>.) We shall use At as a primitive predicate in T and On as a primitive predicate in I. In T , we shall define On in terms of At. <p> Instead, we make use of the following axioms HOM 8i (On (; i) ! 8j v iOn (; j)) Ax10 8i [(8j v i9k v jOn (; k)) ! On (; i)]. Historically, HOM can be recognised as Axiom 9 of [5] and H1 of <ref> [1] </ref>. Our label reflects the idea that the state-like fluents we are dealing with occupy intervals homogeneously. NEG* is given by Hamblin as the definition of negation, while for Allen it is axiom H4. The converse of Ax10 is implied by HOM.

Reference-contexts: v i (On (; j))); of which he says This axiom excludes the possibility of indefinitely finely intermingled periods of redness and non-redness, or of high and low pitch, or of whatever else it is that we take the elementary predicates to represent. 3 The `discrete variation axiom schema' of <ref> [2] </ref> is exactly HAM (allowing for differences of notation). Hamblin's claim is that Ax10 + NEG fl ) HAM: To verify this, recall that NEG* and Ax10 imply the equivalence of () with . <p> As Davis points out, this is a second-order property, since to state it we have to quantify over sets of intervals. 4.4 The Transition Point property Allen and Ferguson <ref> [2] </ref> state a `theorem useful for reasoning about when properties change truth values', which in our notation can be written as (TP) 8i; j (i &lt; j ^ On (; i) ^ On (; j) ! Here TP stands for `transition point', the motivation being: 10 Defining a transition point to <p> This is expressed by P refuzz (; t) = def 8t 0 &lt; t9t 00 &lt;(t 0 ; t)(At (; t 0 ) $ At (; t 00 )): Again, we have symmetry: 8; t (P refuzz (; t) $ P refuzz (; t)): 4 Allen and Ferguson <ref> [2] </ref>, p.541. 11 * Intermingling with respect to immediately after an instant t (for short `post--fuzz on at t') occurs if between t and any -instant (respectively ()-instant) later than t there is a ()-instant (respectively -instant). <p> TP says that if is true over an interval i and false over some later interval j, then there is a transition point at which an interval over which is true meets an interval containing j over which is false. 6.3.1 TP is not entailed by HAM Allen and Ferguson <ref> [2] </ref> claim that HAM entails TP. We begin by showing that this is not, in fact, correct, by constructing a counterexample in which HAM holds but TP does not. Our counterexample is the same set-up as in the previous section, i.e., PREFUZZ fl + POSTCONST.

Reference-contexts: Should one allow this to happen, and if not, how should one prevent it? This phenomenon has been given a number of different names in the literature, e.g. "fuzz" Prior [8] "indefinite intermingling" Hamblin [5] "clustered variation" Davis <ref> [4] </ref> The phenomenon seems to be unavoidable; sometimes, at any rate it is harmless, and it would be pleasant if all the unavoidable instances were of the harmless kind. <p> As far as I know, no-one has ever examined these in a systematic way to determine precisely what each proposed principle achieves and how it is related to the others. That is the purpose of the present paper. (Note though that Davis <ref> [4] </ref> examines in some detail the implications of allowing certain forms of the phenomenon that others have tried to rule out.) Before proceeding any further, we must establish at the outset the existence of two distinct phenomena to which the names `fuzz', `intermingling', or `clustered variation' could apply. <p> Then 9u (t &lt; u ^ Constant (; (t; u))): Hence DAVR fl ) DAVR. Exactly analogous arguments apply to DAVL and DAVL fl 4.3 The Finite Decomposition Property Davis <ref> [4] </ref> gives an axiom equivalent to DAV and notes that in IR-time this is equivalent to the property that any bounded interval contains only finitely many maximal subintervals over which has constant truth-value.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental notion is that of a fluent, which is a function on times. This conforms to the eighteenth-century usage of Newton rather than the usage popularised by McCarthy and Hayes <ref> [6] </ref>, whereby a fluent is a function on situations rather than times. We shall restrict our attention to Boolean fluents, i.e., functions from times to truth-values. Our `times' will be instants or intervals depending on the system we are working in.
