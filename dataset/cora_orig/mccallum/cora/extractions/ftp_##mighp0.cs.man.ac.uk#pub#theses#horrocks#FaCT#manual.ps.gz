Reference-contexts: FaCT is primarily intended as a tool for conceptual schema design and ontological engineering and thus provides only concept based reasoning services: there is a TBox but no ABox. The interface to the TBox is designed to be broadly compatible with that of the Kris system <ref> [BH91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The interface to the TBox is designed to be broadly compatible with that of the Kris system [BH91]. The correspondence between ALC and the propositional modal logic K (m) means that FaCT can also be used as a highly efficient decision procedure for both K (m) and K4 <ref> [GS96, HS97] </ref>. 1.1 Obtaining FaCT FaCT can be obtained from the following world wide web site: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/mig/people/horrocks/FaCT After downloading the file FaCT.tar.gz use the command: gunzip FaCT.tar.gz ; tar xvf FaCT.tar to create a directory FaCT containing the distribution files and directories.
