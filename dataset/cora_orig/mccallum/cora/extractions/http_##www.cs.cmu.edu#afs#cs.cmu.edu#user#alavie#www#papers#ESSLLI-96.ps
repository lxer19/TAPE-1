Title: GLR* A ROBUST PARSER FOR SPONTANEOUSLY SPOKEN LANGUAGE

Abstract: This paper describes GLR*, a parsing system based on Tomita's Generalized LR parsing algorithm, that was designed to be robust to two particular types of extra-grammaticality: noise in the input, and limited grammar coverage. GLR* attempts to overcome these forms of extra-grammaticality by ignoring the unparsable words and fragments and conducting a search for the maximal subset of the original input that is covered by the grammar. The parser is coupled with a beam search heuristic, that limits the combinations of skipped words considered by the parser, and ensures that the parser will operate within feasible time and space bounds. The developed parsing system includes several tools designed to address the difficulties of parsing spontaneous speech: a statistical disambiguation module, an integrated heuristic for evaluating and ranking the parses produced by the parser, and a parse quality heuristic, that allows the parser to self-judge the quality of the parse chosen as best. To evaluate its suitability to parsing spontaneous speech, the GLR* parser was integrated into the JANUS speech translation system. Our evaluations on both transcribed and speech recognized input have indicated that the version of the system that uses GLR* produces about 30% more acceptable translations, than a corresponding version that uses the original non-robust

Reference-contexts: The GLR parsing algorithm evolved out of the LR parsing techniques that were originally developed for parsing programming languages in the late 1960s and early 1970s <ref> [1] </ref>. LR parsers parse the input bottom-up, scanning it from left to right, and producing a rightmost derivation. LR parsers are driven by a table of parsing actions that is pre-compiled from the grammar.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore imperative that the the parser be augmented with a statistical disambiguation module, which can assist the parser in selecting among the ambiguities of a particular parsable input subset. Our probabilistic model is based on a similar model developed by Carroll <ref> [2] </ref>, where probabilities are associated directly with the actions of the parser, as they are defined in the pre-compiled parsing table.

Reference-contexts: GLR* was implemented as an extension to the unification-based Generalized LR Parser/Compiler. 3 The GLR* Parsing Algorithm The GLR* parsing algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> was designed to be robust to two particular types of extra-grammaticality: noise in the input, and limited grammar coverage.

Reference-contexts: An action table that is pre-compiled from the grammar guides the LR parser when parsing an input. The action table specifies the next action that the parser must take, as a function of its current state and the next word of the input. Tomita's Generalized LR parsing algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> extended the original LR parsing algorithm to the case of non-LR languages, where the parsing tables contain entries with multiple parsing actions. The algorithm deterministically simulates the non-determinism introduced by the conflicting actions in the parsing table by efficiently pursuing in a pseudo-parallel fashion all possible actions.

Reference-contexts: Further parsing actions may then refer to the single structure that represents the entire collection of sub-parses, rather than to each of the packed sub-parses separately. Shared packed forests allow common sub-parses of different analyses to be shared via pointers. The Generalized LR Parser/Compiler <ref> [5] </ref> is a unification based practical natural language system that was designed around the GLR parsing algorithm at the Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie Mellon University.
