Reference-contexts: Moreover, they consistently flatten high curvature parts [Del94]. On the other hand, elastic energies expressed in terms of intrinsic parameters such as square curvature <ref> [Bla87] </ref> or square derivative of curvature [MS92] are physically meaningful but are numerically difficult to implement and finally they do not necessary accept circles [Del94] or spheres as optimum shapes.

Reference-contexts: Potential fields techniques has the advantage of only requiring a weak segmentation of the scene. However, oscillations of the model around the local minimum may arise if the potential field is not designed properly. We use a distance method based on the iterative closest point <ref> [BM92] </ref>. At each iteration and for every vertex P i , we search for the closest data point M Cl (i) .

Reference-contexts: Local nonuniform refinement over rectangular grids can be achieved by overlaying hierarchical splines [WW92] but the problem of changing the genus or connectivity of tensor product splines has not yet been addressed. Triangulations on the other hand, are well-suited for local topology control. Delau-nay triangulations <ref> [Boi84] </ref> for instance, generate an optimal tessellation given a set of three dimensional data. <p> Given a set of points of IR d , the Voronoi diagram is a set of cells centered around each vertex such that a point in that cell is closer to that vertex than to any other vertices <ref> [Boi84] </ref>. A Vorono cell is a polyhedron whose faces are bisectors of some pair of vertices. In general, a Vorono diagram in IR d is (d + 1)-connected, but when more than (d + 1) vertices lie on a d-sphere, the diagram may become degenerate.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, in a triangulation, we can only estimate a measure of the mean curvature over the triangles surrounding a vertex, as the sum of the length of each edges multiplied by their associated dihedral angles <ref> [Bor93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Euler relation links the number of vertices V , of edges E and of faces F with the genus g of the mesh: F V E = 3V (5) The genus characterizes the topology of the surface and corresponds to the number of handles of the surface <ref> [Car76] </ref>. In order to represent all kinds of two-manifolds we add, as for contours, the notion of "end" or "invisible face". <p> Mean curvature describes only one aspect the surface shape. A complementary shape information is the Gaussian curvature, measured through the surface geodesy. Both are related to the principal curvatures <ref> [Car76] </ref>: Definition 2 (Mean curvature) Let S : (u; v) 7! P (u; v) be a three dimensional surface defined over an open set IR 2 and P (u 0 ; v 0 ) a point on S. <p> In general the minimal sphere has a contact of order two and is therefore not osculatory. A three dimensional surface is best approximated at the second order by the osculating quadric z = 1 2 (k 1 x 2 + k 2 y 2 ) <ref> [Car76] </ref>. The minimal sphere, however, is the sphere that realizes the best fit of the surface at P . Only for planar curves is the minimal circle also osculary. We now introduce the notion of mean curvature on a simplex mesh from the previous geometric definitions.

Reference-contexts: Some weights can be adjusted to account for surface discontinuities or normal discontinuities. Linear elasticity leads to numerically efficient algorithms but it does not guaranty the fairness of resulting models since they are not expressed in terms of intrinsic parameters. Moreover, they consistently flatten high curvature parts <ref> [Del94] </ref>. On the other hand, elastic energies expressed in terms of intrinsic parameters such as square curvature [Bla87] or square derivative of curvature [MS92] are physically meaningful but are numerically difficult to implement and finally they do not necessary accept circles [Del94] or spheres as optimum shapes. <p> Moreover, they consistently flatten high curvature parts <ref> [Del94] </ref>.

INRIA Simplex Meshes: a General Representation for 3D Shape Reconstruction 23 Our framework does not derive ~ F int from the minimization of some global elastic energy. <p> A contour defined on a 2-simplex mesh is a three dimensional curve, and therefore neither expressions defined in the previous section nor those defined in <ref> [Del94] </ref> do not hold (a three-dimensional contour is not a manifold of codimension one). Several expressions of fairing energies has been proposed ranging from minimal curvature curves [Meh74] or minimum variation curves [MS92] to splines under tension [KWT88][Gue93]. The former expressions are intrinsically formulated but lead to computationally difficult schemes. <p> Instead, we propose a set of shape and smoothness functionals that do not exhibit any shrinking effect and that are expressed in terms of intrinsic parameters. Those functionals are greatly resemblant to those of equation21 or those found in <ref> [Del94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: RR n-2214 34 Herve Delingette where ~ N i is the normal vector at P i and G (x) is the stiffness function (see figure 21). This approach is similar to the one used in <ref> [DHI91b] </ref>. Because we are using a discrete surface representation, moving vertices toward their closest data point would result in a very disorganized mesh structure especially in presence of sparse data.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the shape functionals that we will describe in section 3.2 will be posed in terms of simplex angles but will attempt to control the mean curvature. For performing efficient object recognition, it is important to restrict the amount of shape encoding parameters. In <ref> [DHI93] </ref>, we have developed an efficient recognition system based on "semi-regular" simplex meshes. Those models were characterized by equal metric parameters * 1i = * 2i = * 3i = 1=3 at each vertex in order to encode the object shape with only the n simplex angle values. <p> This fundamental property explains why simplex meshes are better suited than triangulations for performing deformations and smoothing. Furthermore, we can unambiguously encode the shape of an object of complex topology with the the Simplex Angle Image <ref> [DHI93] </ref>. 3 Smoothness and Shape Control 3.1 Equations of Motion We propose a modeling scheme based on deformable and adaptive meshes.

Reference-contexts: This is not a very accurate method for shaping a geometric model. It is nonetheless useful for dragging a simplex mesh out of an undesirable position. For more details on the use of virtual reality techniques in conjunction with simplex meshes, see <ref> [DSCP94] </ref>. 3.5.2 Data Constraints In a surface reconstruction scheme based on deformable models, external forces constrain the displacement of a model toward some three dimensional data. <p> Fitting a mesh on a isosurface greatly differs from previous cases because the data is already segmented and complete. The aim here is to recover a simplified model of the skull in order to perform interactive deformation on a surgery simulator <ref> [DSCP94] </ref> . In order to obtain a more faithful model, it would be more appropriate to utilize the a priori knowledge of the shape and topology of the isosurface. In this example, we first deform a 2000 vertices spherical simplex mesh toward the skull data.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Nastar [NA93] and Gueziec [Gue93] built three dimensional distance maps in order to find the closest point. Feldmar <ref> [FA94] </ref> defined a generalized distance from a surface by including the notion of position, normal orientation and principal curvatures in a single distance measure. On the other hand, McInerney et al.[McI93] builds a potential field from the gradient image and the output of the Canny-Deriche three-dimensional edge detector. <p> When the data set provides both position and normal information, we use a notion of distance between a vertex and a data point that combines their positional and orientation distance (same as Feldmar <ref> [FA94] </ref>). Finally, when fitting isosurfaces defined on medical images, we find the closest point M Cl (i) as the intersection of the normal line defined at P i with the isosurface. This is very efficiently done by keeping at each voxel of the tridimensional image the information of the isosurface.

Reference-contexts: range data or medical images [CCA92][DHI91b][VM93]<ref> [Gue93] </ref>[McI93][NA93][Lei93]. Elastic models successfully address the problem of shape control. However, few researchers have proposed general adaptive reconstruction techniques for solving both geometric and topological aspects. In particular, surface models based on regular grids are not well suited for representing surfaces with a spherical topology [Gue93] and moreover cannot be easily locally refined or decimated. Local nonuniform refinement over rectangular grids can be achieved by overlaying hierarchical splines [WW92] but the problem of changing the genus or connectivity of tensor product splines has not yet been addressed. <p> Several expressions of the external force has been proposed but all of them rely either on the notion of distance between the geometric model and a data set or on the notion of potential field. For instance, Nastar [NA93] and Gueziec <ref> [Gue93] </ref> built three dimensional distance maps in order to find the closest point. Feldmar [FA94] defined a generalized distance from a surface by including the notion of position, normal orientation and principal curvatures in a single distance measure.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a discrete Gaussian curvature on a triangulation is easily computed through the spherical excess or solid angle, whereas the mean curvature is estimated through the simplex angle (see figure 11). It is indeed, a well known geometric result <ref> [Hil44] </ref> that we can estimate the Gaussian curvature around a vertex of a triangulation as the ratio of the solid angle with the sum of the triangles area. and mean curvature.

Reference-contexts: Mean curvature on a surface is an extrinsic measure of the surface bending and can be best pictured as the "nose dive averaged over all directions" <ref> [Koe90, pp 147] </ref>. Mean curvature describes only one aspect the surface shape. A complementary shape information is the Gaussian curvature, measured through the surface geodesy. <p> For instance, a point lying on a minimal surface has the same mean curvature as a point lying on a plane. It is difficult to represent a surface shape with intrinsic parameters, without parameterization. For instance, two surfaces with similar mean and Gaussian curvatures are not necessarily isometric <ref> [Koe90] </ref>. Instead, we introduce k additional parameters at each vertex called metric parameters * i = f* 1i ; : : : ; * ki g that describe how a vertex is located with respect to its k + 1 neighbors.

Reference-contexts: The force then simply writes as ~ F int = ff J (i) ! ! . This force is equivalent to the one obtained when minimizing the square sum of the first derivative as in <ref> [KWT88] </ref>. The curves that nullify this internal force are straight lines.

Reference-contexts: Therefore each vertex can be seen as an independent particle that interacts with its three neighbors and their surrounding vertices. Szeliski <ref> [ST92] </ref> used oriented particles to interpolate 3D data without a priori knowledge of connectivity or topology. The important difference between simplex mesh and particles system is that simplex meshes constrain vertex connectivity to three which restricts the generality of representation but leads to smoother shapes and more efficient computation.

Linear elastic energies corresponding to Tikhonov stabilizing functionals <ref> [TA87] </ref> have been extensively used in computer vision [WW92] [DHI91b][McI93][CCA92]. In its generalized formulation, the energy is composed of a stretching term and a bending term. Some weights can be adjusted to account for surface discontinuities or normal discontinuities.
