Abstract: We describe a system that can track a hand in a sequence of video frames and recognize hand gestures in a user-independent manner. The system locates the hand in each video frame and determines if the hand is open or closed. The tracking system is able to track the hand to within 10 pixels of its correct location in 99:7% of the frames from a test set containing video sequences from 18 different individuals captured in 18 different room environments. The gesture recognition network correctly determines if the hand being tracked is open or closed in 99:1% of the frames in this test set. The system has been designed to operate in real time with existing hardware.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we obtained a sequence of blind test frames from an individual not part of the original training set, and in a different room environment than any of the original training data. Both location networks were training using the ISR <ref> (Keeler et al 1991) </ref> training procedure. The gesture network was trained using online back-propagation. Table 1 summarizes the performance of the two tracking networks individually, as well as the performance of the overall system, on the set of 342 test images.

Reference-contexts: The structure of convolutional networks makes them naturally good at dealing with translation invariance, and with coarse representations at the upper layers, they are also capable of dealing with some degree of size variation. Convolutional networks have been successfully applied to machine print OCR <ref> (Platt et al, 1992) </ref>, machine print address block location (Wolf and Platt, 1994), and hand printed OCR (Le Cun et al, 1990; Martin and Rashid, 1992). In each of these problems, convolutional networks perform very well on simultaneously segmenting and recognizing two-dimensional objects.

Reference-contexts: The evaluation of these three networks requires approximately 25 million operations per frame, which would allow real time operation at video frame rates using existing convolutional hardware <ref> (Sackinger, 1992) </ref>. We have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks can be used to solve both the hand tracking and gesture recognition problems. The networks can find the hand in 99.7% of the test frames and recognize whether the hand was open or closed in 99.1% of the test frames.
