Abstract: First-principles calculations are performed to investigate alloying and ferroelectric effects in lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with high Ti composition. We find that the main effect of alloying in the paraelectric phase of PZT is the existence of two sets of B-O bonds, i.e., shorter Ti-O bonds vs. longer Zr-O bonds. On the other hand, ferroelectricity leads to the formation of very short covalent Ti-O bonds and to the formation of covalent chains of Pb-O bonds. The covalency in the ferroelectric phase is mainly induced by an enhancement of hybridization between Ti 3d and O 2p, and between Pb 6s and O 2p. These hybridizations induce a striking decrease of the effective charges when going from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric phase of PZT.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The technologically important lead zirconate titanate alloy (i.e., PbZr 1x Ti x O 3 usually denoted as PZT) has an interesting phase diagram <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> RESULTS Centrosymmetric case Optimizing each degree of freedom in the centrosymmetric supercell leads to the lattice vectors ~a 1;c = a 0 <ref> [1; 0; 0] </ref>, ~a 2;c = a 0 [0; 1; 0], and ~a 3;c = a 0 [0; 0; 2:99], where a 0 =7.498 a.u. is the lattice parameter. <p> RESULTS Centrosymmetric case Optimizing each degree of freedom in the centrosymmetric supercell leads to the lattice vectors ~a 1;c = a 0 [1; 0; 0], ~a 2;c = a 0 <ref> [0; 1; 0] </ref>, and ~a 3;c = a 0 [0; 0; 2:99], where a 0 =7.498 a.u. is the lattice parameter. The renormalized c=a ratio defined as the actual ratio (i.e., 2.99) divided by the ideal one (i.e., 3.00) is equal to 0.997 and is thus very close to unity. <p> true value in Pb (Zr 1=3 Ti 2=3 ), since recent measurements performed on Pb (Zr 1x Ti x ) films [18] for x=0.6 found a value of 1.035 for this ratio, to be compared with values of 1.064 and 1.02 for x = 1 and x ' 0:5 respectively <ref> [1] </ref>. The optimized non-centrosymmetric cell has an energy that is 0.15 eV/5-atom-cell lower than that of the optimized centrosym metric cell. This is consistent with the fact that the experimental ground state of Pb (Zr 1=3 Ti 2=3 ) is ferroelectric and tetragonal rather than paraelectric and cubic.

Reference-contexts: The high-temperature phase of this alloy at all compositions is the cubic perovskite structure. Previous theoretical studies <ref> [2] </ref> focused on the long-range B-site ordering effects in PZT for a Ti composition equal to 0.5, i.e., close to the morphotropic phase boundary between rhombohedral and tetragonal ferroelectric phases.

Reference-contexts: The B-site ordering of this supercell consists of one Zr plane alternating with two Ti planes along the [001] direction. We perform local-density approximation (LDA) calculations on this supercell using the Vanderbilt ultrasoft-pseudopotential scheme <ref> [3] </ref>, and including the semicore shells for all the metals considered. Specifically, the Pb 5d, 6s and 6p, the Zr 4s, 4p, 4d and 5s, the Ti 3s, 3p, 3d and 4s, and the O 2s and 2p electrons are treated as valence electrons.

Reference-contexts: The first-principles calculations throughout this work are performed using a (6,6,2) Monkhorst-Pack mesh [6]. Further technical details of the procedure used in the present study can be found in Ref. <ref> [7] </ref>. In fact, we perform two different calculations corresponding to two different symmetries of the structure shown in Fig. 1: (1) using a centrosymmetric cell (i.e., exhibiting an inversion symmetry about the central Pb atom); and (2) using a ferroelectric cell (i.e., relaxing the inversion symmetry constraint).

Reference-contexts: The effective charges in each case (i.e., in both non-centrosymmetric and centrosymmetric cells) will then be calculated from the polarization differences between the ground state and slightly distorted structures, following the procedure introduced in Ref. <ref> [8] </ref> and intensively used in Ref. [9].

[8] and intensively used in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> The Born effective charges for our PZT supercell are detailed in Table I. They exhibit the same trends as in cubic bulk PbTiO 3 and PbZrO 3 compounds <ref> [9] </ref>: large values of about +4.0 for Pb atoms; large values around +6.5 for the B atoms; and two sets of values for the oxygen atoms, either close to -5.5 for oxygen atoms moving parallel to the B-O-B chain, or close to -2.5 for oxygen atoms moving perpendicular to these chains. <p> 7.223 0.628 0.000 -0.238 -2.15 -4.80 O9 0.779 3.731 11.192 0.779 0.000 0.000 -2.07 -2.90 very similar to that of Zr, while the difference between these two effective charges in the bulk parent compounds is larger than 1.0 (i.e., 7.06 vs. 5.85 for Ti and Zr respectively, according to Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>). <p> out that the effective charge along [001] for atom O7 sitting between the Ti and Zr atoms is -5.39, i.e., very close to the average value -5.32 of the corresponding oxygen effective charges in the bulk parents (-5.83 and -4.81 for PbTiO 3 and PbZrO 3 respectively, according to Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>). Ferroelectric effects We now turn to a consideration of the ferroelectric effects on bond-length distributions and effective charges.

Reference-contexts: This prediction must be very close to the true value in Pb (Zr 1=3 Ti 2=3 ), since recent measurements performed on Pb (Zr 1x Ti x ) films <ref> [18] </ref> for x=0.6 found a value of 1.035 for this ratio, to be compared with values of 1.064 and 1.02 for x = 1 and x ' 0:5 respectively [1].

Reference-contexts: However, the oxygens exhibiting the shortest Pb-O bonds now share a common (100) plane, while they share a common (001) plane in the non-polar structure. Pair-distribution function analysis of recent pulsed neutron powder diffraction measurements on ferroelectric PZT alloys clearly confirms the existence of these three different groups <ref> [19] </ref>. The experimental average value of the three different Pb-O bond lengths is ~2.5 A,~2.9 A, and ~3.4 A, i.e., in excellent agreement with our predictions. Comparing Table I and Table II also indicates that ferroelectricity leads to a striking decrease of the Born effective charges.

Reference-contexts: In fact, we also found similar behavior for the electronic charge density in the (Ti,O) plane for cubic and tetragonal lead titanate (PT). Thus, as in bulk PT <ref> [22] </ref>, the formation of ferroelectricity in tetragonal PZT leads to an enhancement of hybridization between Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals. Interestingly, we don't observe in Fig. 2 any breaking of Zr-O bonds nor the formation of strong covalent Zr-O bonds. <p> Only the upper half of the supercell is shown; the horizontal and vertical axes lie along [100] and [001] respectively. Atoms appearing at the left and right edges are O; atoms in the middle are Pb. of paraelectric and ferroelectric PT. Thus, as in bulk PT <ref> [22] </ref>, the hybridization between Pb 6s and O 2p orbitals plays an important role in the ferroelectric behavior of tetragonal PZT.
