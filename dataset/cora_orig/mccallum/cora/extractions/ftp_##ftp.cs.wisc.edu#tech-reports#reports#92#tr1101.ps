Abstract: Given an n fi n matrix M, a vector q in IR n , and a polyhedral convex set X = fxjAx b; Bx = dg, where A is an m fi n matrix and B is an p fi n matrix, the affine variational inequality problem is to find x 2 X such that for all y 2 X. If M is positive semi-definite, the affine variational inequality can be transformed to a generalized complementarity problem, which can be solved in polynomial time using the path following method of Kojima et.al. The main contribution of this paper is that the particular structure of the problem is exploited, rather than artificial variables being introduced to construct a standard form problem.

Reference-contexts: FERRIS Complementarity problems of this form correspond to maximal monotone multifunction (see [6]) under the following condition rank 0 @ B T M 1 A = n + p (1.1) In this case, we call (GLCP) a generalized complementarity problem following the notation of Guler (see <ref> [2] </ref>). We show that any given AVI (q; M; X) can be reduced to an equivalent problem AVI (q; M ; X ) such that (1.1) is satisfied. The path following method used by Kojima et.al. for solving linear complementarity problem can be adapted to solve this problem. <p> The next theorem follows as a direct consequence of the solvability of (3.4) and <ref> [2, Theorem 2.1] </ref>. Theorem 3.3. Suppose T is defined by (3.1). Then T is maximal monotone. <p> Since V u + U v = U V e e and according to (3.3) u T v 0 All the estimates for proving of Theorem 1 of [4] are valid ( also see <ref> [2, Section 5] </ref> ), and our theorem is therefore proven.

Reference-contexts: There are three appendices; Appendix A shows how to construct an artificial problem with a easily generated starting point. Appendix B shows how to construct an exact solution of (GLCP) from an approximate solution generated by the path following algorithm. These are generalization of work found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Appendix C proves an algebraic property of positive semi-definite matrices which we use throughout the paper. The following is a summary of our notation and the basic concepts employed. <p> The assumption (1.1) further implies that T is maximal.

Such a complementarity problem can be solved in polynomial time by using a path following method similar to the one proposed by Kojima et. al. in <ref> [4] </ref>. The complexity of solving AVI (q; M; X) is O (m 2 (m + n + p) 3 L), which can be further reduced to O (m 1 5 if we incorporate a more sophisticated rank-one update scheme.

The idea of tracing the central path is implemented by constructing Newton steps for F . 4. The Path Following Algorithm We assume that all elements of the matrix Q = B M q B d C are integers.

Reference-contexts: In this case, we also say that (s; u; v; x) is basic. See <ref> [7, Section 3.4.4] </ref> for a proof. Our objective is to construct a basic solution, in polynomial time, from an approximate solution given by the path following method. The following lemma points to the existence of certain basic solution that is closely related to a given approximate solution.
