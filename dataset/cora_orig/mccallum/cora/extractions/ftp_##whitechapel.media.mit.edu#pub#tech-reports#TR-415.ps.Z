Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 415 Edited version published in the Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, April 14-16, 1998 in Nara, Japan. Abstract This paper describes a framework for human motion understanding, defined here as estimation of the physical state of the body (the Plant) combined with interpretation of that part of the motion that cannot be predicted by the plant alone (the Behavior). The described behavior system operates in conjunction with a real-time, fully-dynamic, 3-D person tracking system that provides a mathematically concise formulation for incorporating a wide variety of physical constraints and probabilistic influences. The framework takes the form of a non-linear recursive filter that enables lower-level, probabilistic processes to take advantage of the contextual knowledge encoded in the higher-level models.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes a real-time, fully-dynamic, 3-D person tracking system that is able to tolerate full (temporary) occlusions and whose performance is substantially unaffected by the presence of multiple people. The system is driven by 2-D blob features observed in two or more cameras <ref> [1, 22] </ref> and by behavior models that estimate control signals. These features and controls are then probabilistically integrated into a fully-dynamic 3-D skeletal model, which in turn drives the 2-D feature tracking process by setting appropriate prior probabilities. <p> These 2-D features are the input to the 3-D blob estimation equation used by Azarbayejani and Pentland <ref> [1] </ref>. This observation equation relates the 2-D distribution of pixel values to a tracked object's 3-D position and orientation. These observations supply constraints on the underlying 3-D human model. Due to their statistical nature, observations are easily modeled as soft constraints.

Reference-contexts: These early efforts used edge information to drive a kinematic model of the human body. More recently, several authors have applied variations on this basic method to the body tracking problem <ref> [18, 2] </ref>. Because of the highly non-linear nature of the problem, all of these systems require fairly precise initialization, and can not handle the full range of common body motion. Following this early work using kinematic models, some researchers began using dynamic constraints to track the human body.

Reference-contexts: This system also attempts to explicitly incorporate learned patterns of control into the body model. The approach we take is based on the behavior modeling framework introduced in Pentland and Liu 1995 [14]; it is also related to the behavior modeling work of Blake 1996 [6] and Bregler 1997 <ref> [3] </ref>. However, this controller operates on a 3-D non-linear model of human motion that is closer to true body dynamics than 2-D linear models. 2 Mathematical Framework The human body is a complex dynamic system, whose visual features are time-varying, noisy signals.

Reference-contexts: Previous attempts at person tracking have utilized a generic set of image features (e.g., edges, optical flow) that were computed as a preprocessing step, without consideration of the task to be accomplished. In this aspect our system is similar to that of Dickmanns in automobile control <ref> [4] </ref>, and we believe that we can obtain similar advantages in efficiency and stability though this direct coupling.

Reference-contexts: Again, these systems required precise initialization and could handle a limited range of body motion. More recently, Gavrila and Davis <ref> [5] </ref> and Rehg and Kanade [17], have demonstrated that an analysis-synthesis approach, using kinematic models driven by edge data, has the potential to deal with limited occlusions, and thus to handle a greater range of body motions.

Reference-contexts: J is the constraint Jacobian, K is a known constant vector, and is the vector of unknown Lagrange multipliers: J T WJ = K (7) Many fast, stable methods exist for solving equations of this form <ref> [15] </ref>. 4.2 Soft Constraints Some constraints are probabilistic in nature. Noisy image measurements are a constraint of this sort, they influence the dynamic model but do not impose hard constraints on its behavior. Soft constraints such as these can be expressed as a potential field acting on the dynamic system.

Reference-contexts: This is the Forward algorithm for HMM models <ref> [16] </ref>. Estimation proceeds by identifying the most likely state given the current observation and the last state, and then using the observation density of that state as described above.

Reference-contexts: Since human motion evolves over time, in a complex way, it is advantageous to explicitly model temporal dependence and internal states. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one way to do this, and has been shown to perform quite well recognizing human motion <ref> [19] </ref>. The probability that the model is in a certain state, S j given a sequence of observations, O 1 ; O 2 ; : : : ; O N , is defined recursively. <p> One class of HMMs, the Delta models, were trained on the differences between the last mouse state and the current state. This is a well known technique when using HMMs to recognize human gesture <ref> [19] </ref>. The other class of HMMs, the Innovation models, were trained on the innovations sequence from a Kalman filter. the innovation is the error between on observation and the prediction of that observation by the linear model inside the filter.

Reference-contexts: This is known as the multiple model or generalized likelihood approach, and produces a generalized maximum likelihood estimate of the current and future values of the state variables <ref> [20] </ref>. Moreover, the cost of the Kalman filter calculations is sufficiently small to make the approach quite practical. Intuitively, this solution breaks the person's overall behavior down into several "prototypical" behaviors. For instance, we might have dynamic models corresponding to a relaxed state, a very "tight" state, and so forth.

In a virtual work formulation, all the links in a model have full range of unconstrained motion.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes a real-time, fully-dynamic, 3-D person tracking system that is able to tolerate full (temporary) occlusions and whose performance is substantially unaffected by the presence of multiple people. The system is driven by 2-D blob features observed in two or more cameras <ref> [1, 22] </ref> and by behavior models that estimate control signals. These features and controls are then probabilistically integrated into a fully-dynamic 3-D skeletal model, which in turn drives the 2-D feature tracking process by setting appropriate prior probabilities. <p> computational convenience we will interpret this as a Gaussian model: Pr (Oj k ; K k ) = 2 (O k ) T K 1 (2) 2 jK k j 2 The Gaussian interpretation is not terribly significant, because we also keep a pixel-by-pixel support map showing the actual occupancy <ref> [22] </ref>. These 2-D features are the input to the 3-D blob estimation equation used by Azarbayejani and Pentland [1]. This observation equation relates the 2-D distribution of pixel values to a tracked object's 3-D position and orientation. These observations supply constraints on the underlying 3-D human model.
