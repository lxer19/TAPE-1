Abstract: We investigate realtime techniques for visualization of very large images over a thinwire. We exploit multi-foveated images which have extremely favorable data density, as compared to uniform resolution images. To compensate for the loss of uniform resolution, we now allow the user new dynamic controls over the visualization process. Current servers of large images on the net (e.g., map servers) suffers from a distinctly non-realtime response, its small viewing windows, and visual discontinues in panning/zooming. We have constructed an image server that can overcome these limitations. Our foveation techniques are based on a novel application of wavelets.

Reference-contexts: The variable resolution can allow the server to dynamically adjust the amount of transmitted data to match the effective bandwidth of the network. The relation of this paper to <ref> [1] </ref> is as following. In [1], we introduced our based foveation techniques and investigated basic properties of foveation. <p> The variable resolution can allow the server to dynamically adjust the amount of transmitted data to match the effective bandwidth of the network.

The storage of the image on the server side involves an initial preprocessing step. To use wavelet-based multi-resolution techniques, we begin by constructing and storing a wavelet transform of the image. See <ref> [1] </ref> for details. We currently use the Haar wavelet some of our techniques exploit properties of this choice although this is by no means essential. Entries in the wavelet transform matrices are called coefficients, and these are what is communicated over the thinwire.

Reference-contexts: We call these multi-foveated images because such images need not have only a single foveal region with high resolution. 2 Previous Work Some forms of the above ideas have been exploited before. Hill et al <ref> [2] </ref> is one of the early papers that describe many of the features we desire. It has progressive transmission and a form of foveation for a browser of images in an archive. But the realtime requirement does not appear to be a concern.

Reference-contexts: Again, this idea is not new: it is a key technique in walkthrough applications, where video rates are achieved by omission of details (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Levoy and Whitaker [6] exploits foveation in volumetric visualization. The production of foveated images using superpixels with fixed geometries have been described by Wallace et al [9] and by Kortum and Geisler [5]. Our wavelet approach is more flexible. Gross et al <ref> [4] </ref> use wavelets in a way that is remarkably similar to ours, but not for foveation purposes. Kortum and Geisler also conducted psychological experiments in which subjects reported little perceptual difference between foveated and uniform images. Our system is interactive as well as realtime.

Reference-contexts: Clearly this is a suboptimal approach since no preselected set of views can anticipate the needs of all users. Map servers (e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>, URL http://www.mapquest.com/, etc) use an improved approach where the user may zoom and pan over the large image. But current implementations suffer from three problems: * Visual discontinuities in zooming and panning.
