Abstract: We study how to combine the notions of blind signatures and group signatures. In this paper we construct a practical group blind signature scheme. Our scheme is an extension of Camenisch and Stadler's Group Digital Signature Scheme [4]. Our scheme can be used in an electronic cash system to allow multiple banks to securely distribute anonymous and untraceable e-cash. Previous literature focused on a single bank e-cash model. Our scheme also applies to distributed electronic voting. Our scheme is practical, because the space, time, and communication complexities of the relevant parameters and operations are independent of the group size.

Our scheme consists of several signers (members of the group), their group manager, and several users. We combine two concepts: blind signatures [5, 15, 13] and group signatures [4, 8, 3, 9]. <p> Our scheme consists of several signers (members of the group), their group manager, and several users.

The signer is unable to view message she signs (blindness of signatures). This is new with our scheme. 2. <p> Open: an algorithm which, on input (s; S) returns the identity of the group member who issued the signature s together with a proof of this fact. Our scheme is the first to extend group signatures to allow for blind signing. As in <ref> [4] </ref>, the following parameters are of interest; all but the last one are constant in the size of the group, but linear in the security parameters: * the size of the group public key Y * the length of signatures * the efficiency of the protocols Setup, Join, Sign, Verify. * <p> Just as in <ref> [4] </ref> the protocol Open can be made constant with a compromise in security of the scheme; the basic scheme's Open is linear in the size of the group. 3 Techniques In this section, we present some well-studied techniques for proving knowledge of discrete logarithms and related problems. <p> The signature of knowledge is a way for one person to convince another person that he knows some fact without actually revealing that fact.

The proofs of security that work for [4] also work for our signatures of knowledge. <p> All the signatures of knowledge proposed by <ref> [4] </ref> can be proved secure in the random oracle model and their interactive versions are zero-knowledge. 7 To construct blind signatures of knowledge, we modify some of the signature of knowledge constructs proposed by [4].

The proofs of security that work for [4] also work for our signatures of knowledge. The first signature of knowledge we consider, both in the regular and blind settings, is the signature of knowledge of the discrete logarithm of a given y 2 G to the base g (hgi = G). <p> We now define signatures of knowledge based on variations of the discrete logarithm problem and extend the protocol above to construct blind versions of these signatures. One important variation is the representation problem, studied in <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. It is direct generalization of the signature of knowledge discussed above, except we have y 1 ; :::; y w instead of just one y, and g 1 ; :::; g v , instead of just one g. <p> We give a more formal treatment of signatures of knowledge based on the representation problem in the appendix. We also employ signatures of knowledge of double discrete logarithm and of roots of discrete logarithms introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> and show how to make them blind signatures. 9 Definition 3.2 A signature of knowledge of a double discrete logarithm of y to the bases g and a, on message m, with security parameter l k denoted SKLOGLOG l [ff j y = g (a ff ) ](m), is an <p> We outline this in the appendix due to lack of space. 4 Our Group Blind Signature Scheme Camenisch and Stadler <ref> [4] </ref> have two schemes for group signatures: their basic scheme and their efficient scheme. Their efficient scheme is less secure and therefore in this paper we concentrate on extending their basic scheme to allow for blind signatures. <p> Their efficient scheme is less secure and therefore in this paper we concentrate on extending their basic scheme to allow for blind signatures. However, our techniques apply to both. 4.1 Setup To set up the group signature scheme, as in <ref> [4] </ref>, the group manager computes the following values: 1. An RSA Public Key (n,e) 2. A cyclic group G = hgi of order n for which computing discrete logarithms is hard. <p> An upper bound on the length of the secret keys and a constant * &gt; 1. The group's public key is Y = (n; e; G; g; a; ; *). 4.2 Join As in <ref> [4] </ref>, if Alice wants to join the group she picks a secret key x 2 R f0; 1; : : : ; 2 1g and calculates y = a x (mod n) and the membership key z = g y . <p> If the group manager is convinced that Alice knows x he gives her a membership certificate v (y + 1) 1=e (mod n). It is an additional security assumption due to <ref> [4] </ref> that computing v without factoring n is hard. 12 4.3 Sign and Verify Unlike [4], our signature construction protocol is blind. When responding to a sign request, the signer does the following: 1. Obtain q 2 R Z fl n and set ~z := ~g y 2. <p> If the group manager is convinced that Alice knows x he gives her a membership certificate v (y + 1) 1=e (mod n). It is an additional security assumption due to <ref> [4] </ref> that computing v without factoring n is hard. 12 4.3 Sign and Verify Unlike [4], our signature construction protocol is blind. When responding to a sign request, the signer does the following: 1. Obtain q 2 R Z fl n and set ~z := ~g y 2. <p> All signatures take constant space, and communication complexity per signature is constant. Computational, space, and communication complexities are linear in the security parameter l. 4.6 Security of the Proposed Scheme Our scheme is exactly as secure as Camenisch and Stadler's Basic Group Signature Scheme <ref> [4] </ref>. The security of the scheme is based on the assumptions that the discrete logarithm, double discrete logarithm, and the roots of discrete logarithm problems are hard. In addition, it is based on the security of the Schnorr and the RSA signature schemes and on the additional assumption due to [4] <p> <ref> [4] </ref>. The security of the scheme is based on the assumptions that the discrete logarithm, double discrete logarithm, and the roots of discrete logarithm problems are hard. In addition, it is based on the security of the Schnorr and the RSA signature schemes and on the additional assumption due to [4] that computing membership certificates is hard. 14 4.7 Improvements on the Efficiency Camenisch and Stadler [4] also proposed a group signature scheme in which the computational complexity of the Open algorithm is constant in the size of the group. <p> In addition, it is based on the security of the Schnorr and the RSA signature schemes and on the additional assumption due to <ref> [4] </ref> that computing membership certificates is hard. 14 4.7 Improvements on the Efficiency Camenisch and Stadler [4] also proposed a group signature scheme in which the computational complexity of the Open algorithm is constant in the size of the group. This scheme can also be extended to a group blind signature scheme. <p> Our result is an extension of the group signature scheme recently prosposed by Camenisch and Stadler in <ref> [4] </ref>. We showed how our construction could be used to set up an electronic cash system in which more than one bank can dispense anonymous e-cash.

Reference-contexts: In real life, one would like for more than one bank to be able to dispense electronic money. Our scheme is unique since it considers scalability as a criterion in the design of electronic cash systems. 1.2 Blind Digital Signatures Blind Digital Signatures were introduced by Chaum <ref> [6] </ref> to enable spender anonymity in Electronic Cash systems. Such signatures require that a signer be able to sign a document without knowing its contents. <p> First we give the main ideas, and then explain how to fix some of the relevant problems. This basic technique is due to Chaum <ref> [6] </ref>. All the banks form a group and their manager will be the country's Central Bank (e.g. U.S. Treasury or the Federal Reserve). If Alice wants to withdraw e-cash from her bank, she first creates an electronic coin C.
