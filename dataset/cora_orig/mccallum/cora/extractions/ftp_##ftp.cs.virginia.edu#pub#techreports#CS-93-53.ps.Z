Title: A Formal Semantics for Evaluating Cryptographic Protocols p 1 A Formal Semantics for Evaluating Cryptographic Protocols  
Author: Alec F. Yasinsac and William A. Wulf 
Abstract: Much research in the field of network security is concentrated on the technology and application of cryptography. While the cryptographic methods are heavily investigated to ensure confidence in the security of the code, many cryptographic schemes are vulnerable due to the protocols used to implement communication in a cryptographic environment. Much work has been done to develop secure protocols, but protocols, like software, are very difficult to verify. Recent research is aimed at finding methods of verifying cryptographic protocols, though no method has achieved widespread acceptance and use. The research presented here is focused on developing a methodology for verifying cryptographic protocols based on the classical program verification technique of weakest precondition. A specification language based on an ad hoc standard pseudo code will be proposed and a formal semantics given to allow evaluation of cryptographic protocols.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we propose such a method. 2.0 Logics for Evaluating Cryptographic Protocols What is quickly becoming the classic paper in protocol verification is by Burrows, Abadi, and A Formal Semantics for Evaluating Cryptographic Protocols p 5 Needham <ref> [BAN90] </ref>. The Logic of Authentication (hereafter referred to as BAN logic) they propose is a straightforward mechanism that allows reasoning about beliefs that principals may have during a protocol run. BAN logic has achieved widespread acceptance as the standard logic for protocol verification, though it has not achieved widespread implementation. <p> This topic continues to be a matter of research [SYV93]. Many of the logics designed to verify cryptographic protocols <ref> [BAN90] </ref>, [GNY90], [MOS89] are used in the same three steps: 1 - The protocol is transformed into some idealized form 2 - Assumptions are made about the state and environment of the system 3 - A mechanical, step by step analysis of the protocol is conducted The benefit of these systems
