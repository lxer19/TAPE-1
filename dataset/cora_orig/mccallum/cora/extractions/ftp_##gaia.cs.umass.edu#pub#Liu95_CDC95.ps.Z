Abstract: In this paper we consider a particular class of linear systems under the max-plus algebra and derive exponential upper bounds for the tail distribution of each component of the state vector in the case of Markov modulated input sequences. Our results are then applied to tandem queues with infinite buffers, Markov modulated arrivals and deterministic service times.

Reference-contexts: Since the transition matrix P of the Markov chain (Y n ) n is irreducible, the matrices J i () are all irreducible. Thus, according to Perron-Frobenius Theorem <ref> [11, Theorem 8.4.4] </ref>, the spectral radius i () of matrix J i () (1 i g) is a simple eigenvalue of the matrix and there is a positive vector z i () = (z k;t ()) k2V i ; t2S such that z i () J i () = i () <p> Since the matrix H () is block triangular, its spectrum is the union of the spec tra of matrices J 1 (); : : : ; J g (), which in turn implies that () = max i (): (7) It then follows <ref> [11, Theorem 8.3.1] </ref> that () is also an eigenvalue of H () and that there is a nonnegative vector y () = (y k;t ()) k2K; t2S such that y () H () = () y (): (8) We also normalize y () so that X y k;t () = 1:

Reference-contexts: The second step of the proof consists in checking that the functions ffl j;s = b () y j;s () exp (x); j 2 K; s 2 Sg satisfy (13). This proof is analogous to the proof of Proposition 2 in <ref> [18] </ref> and is therefore omitted. Let us simply point out for later use that this proof only uses the property that y () H () y () if () 1 (which follows from (8)) and does not require the identity (8). <p> Note that certain forms of non-deterministic service times are permitted by augmenting the state space of the original Markov chain (Z n ) n . 4 Concluding Remarks In this paper, we have extended our work for single queues <ref> [18, 19] </ref> to stochastic linear systems under the max-plus algebra, as defined by (2), and have derived exponential upper bounds on P (X n;k &gt; x). The max-plus structure defined in (2) appears to be a particular case of the structure considered by Chang in [4].
