Abstract: This paper has been submitted to SINUM -12/96) Abstract. Various sophisticated finite element models for surface water flow exist in the literature. Gray, Kolar, Luettich, Lynch and Westerink have developed a hydrodynamic model based on the generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE) formulation, and have formulated a Galerkin finite element procedure based on combining the GWCE with the nonconservative momentum equations. Numerical experiments suggest that this method is robust, accurate and suppresses spurious oscillations which plague other models. In this paper, we analyze a closely related Galerkin method which uses the conservative momentum equations (CME). For this GWCE-CME system of equations, we present, for discrete time, an a priori error estimate based on an L 2 projection. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we derive a-priori error estimates for a discrete-time finite element approximation to a model of shallow water flow. These estimates

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. In this paper, we derive a-priori error estimates for a discrete-time finite element approximation to a model of shallow water flow. These estimates extend our continuous-time analysis given in <ref> [1] </ref>. We consider a shallow water model of Gray et al described in a series of papers beginning in [7]; see also [6]. <p> To that end, we only consider the cases when diffusion terms in the CME are treated explicitly (fi 1 = 0; fi 2 = 1) or implicitly (fi 1 = 1; fi 2 = 0). 4. A-Priori Discrete-time Error Estimate. Following the analysis in <ref> [1] </ref>, we will compare our finite element approximations (ffi; Q) satisfying (15)-(18) to L 2 pro jections ( e ~; e q) satisfying (~ k e ~ k ); v = 0; 8v 2 S h ; k 1; (q k e q ); w = 0; 8w 2 S h <p> Let us proceed with the inductive argument. Based on the continuous-time analog, Lemma 4.2 of <ref> [1] </ref>, 9 positive constants C fl ; C fl and C flfl = C fl =2; C flfl = 2C fl such that for k = 0; : : :; N , C fl h b + e ~ k ; r (h b + e ~ k ) C fl <p> Terms P 1 P 9 and P 11 P 15 are treated similarly to the corresponding terms in continuous time (using test function v 1 with r = 0) investigated thoroughly in <ref> [1] </ref>. We now investigate the remaining terms. In estimating P 10 ; recall (2) and use Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 in [1] to obtain P 10 = (^t bf 0 ) e q 0 ; r 1 = c f fi fi Q 0 = 0 fi fi ` 2 <p> 9 and P 11 P 15 are treated similarly to the corresponding terms in continuous time (using test function v 1 with r = 0) investigated thoroughly in <ref> [1] </ref>. We now investigate the remaining terms.

Again, we investigate the remaining terms. The treatment of terms S 1 and S 2 is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: Before proceeding, it will be necessary to make certain assumptions about the Galerkin approximations. We employ an inductive argument similar to that made in <ref> [3] </ref> to handle nonlinearities. In particular, we will assume that the Galerkin approximations are bounded by some constant (for k = 0; : : : ; N 1) in order to derive the a priori error estimate.

Reference-contexts: These estimates extend our continuous-time analysis given in [1]. We consider a shallow water model of Gray et al described in a series of papers beginning in [7]; see also <ref> [6] </ref>.

For technical reasons, we have found that this model lends itself more easily to error analysis. A finite element simulator based on the GWCE-NCME formulation has been developed by Luettich, et al. In <ref> [6] </ref>, it was demonstrated that the approximations generated by this simulator accurately matched tidal data taken from the English Channel and southern North Sea. The temporal discretization scheme we will consider adheres closely to the scheme implemented in this simulator. The rest of this paper is outlined as follows.
