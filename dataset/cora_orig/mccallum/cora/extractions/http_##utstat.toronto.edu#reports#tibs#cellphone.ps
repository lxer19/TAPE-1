Title: Cellular telephones and motor vehicle collisions: some variations on matched case-control analysis  
Abstract: We describe the analysis of some matched pair binary data arising from a study designed to investigate whether cellular telephones are associated with motor vehicle collisions. Conditional and random effects approaches to the problem are derived and compared. Driving intermittency is a potential confounder, and its effect is assessed by strategic choices of the control period, and by application of the bootstrap.
