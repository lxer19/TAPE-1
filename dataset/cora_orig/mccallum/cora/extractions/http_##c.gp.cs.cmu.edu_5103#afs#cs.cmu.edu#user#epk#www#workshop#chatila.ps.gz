Abstract: A planetary rover cannot rely in general on permanent and immediate communications with a control station. This precludes direct teleop-aration of its motions. It has therefore to be endowed with a large autonomy in achieving its navigation. We have designed and experimented with the mobile robot ADAM a complete system for autonomous navigation in a planetary-like environment. We describe this work in this paper. The approach is primarly based on the adaptation of the perception and motion actions to the environment and to the status of the robot. The navigation task involves several levels of reasoning, several environment representations, and several action modes. The robot is able to select sub-goals, navigation modes, and perception actions ac cording to the situation.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of the navigation processes depends on the general context in which this task is to be executed (nature of the environment, efficiency constraints,...) and should be adapted to it. Navigation in outdoors environments was addressed either for specific tasks, e.g., road following <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> , or motion in rather limited environment conditions [ 2; 3 ] . Ambler [ 4 ] is a legged machine and the main problem was computing footholes.
