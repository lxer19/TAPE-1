Abstract: Similarity measurements between 3D objects and 2D images are useful for the tasks of object recognition and classification. We distinguish between two types of similarity metrics: metrics computed in image-space (image metrics) and metrics computed in transformation-space (transformation metrics). Existing methods typically use image metrics; namely, metrics that measure the difference in the image between the observed image and the nearest view of the object. Example for such a measure is the Euclidean distance between feature points in the image and their corresponding points in the nearest view. (This measure can be computed by solving the exterior orientation calibration problem.) In this paper we introduce a different type of metrics: transformation metrics. These metrics penalize for the deformations applied to the object to produce the observed image. In particular, we define a transformation metric that optimally penalizes for "affine deformations" under weak-perspective. A closed-form solution, together with the nearest view according to this metric, are derived. The metric is shown to be equivalent to the Euclidean image metric, in the sense that they bound each other from both above and below. It therefore provides an easy-to-use closed-form approximation for the commonly-used least-squares distance between models and images. We demonstrate an image understanding application, where the true dimensions of a photographed battery charger are estimated by minimizing the transformation metric.

Reference-contexts: Simulations [2] show that these bounds often provide better estimates than those provided by using alignment. Finally, our transformation metric can be used in schemes that attempt to classify objects. A scheme for classification was recently proposed <ref> [1] </ref>, in which classes contain objects that share the same basic features in distorted positions. Our metric can be used under such a scheme to evaluate the amount of affine distortion applied to the object relative to a prototype object in order to determine its class identity.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we begin by translating the model and image points so that n X ~p i = i=1 IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 18 (4):465-470, 1996 6 We claim that now ~ t = 0 obtains the minimum (a proof is given in <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The sub-optimal solution derived using the image metric provides a better estimate for the image metric than the affine solution, which has been used for example in <ref> [3] </ref> as the initial guess for computing the perspective image metric numerically. Another potential application of the metric is in evaluating hypothesized correspondences in an alignment algorithm. Alignment is a method for evaluating the similarity between models and images based on a small number of correspondences.

Reference-contexts: A common approach to recognition uses features (such as points or edges) to represent objects. An object is recognized in this approach if there exists a viewpoint from which the model features coincide with the corresponding image features, e.g. <ref> [4, 7, 9] </ref>. Since images often are noisy and models occasionally are imperfect, it is rarely the case that a model aligns perfectly with the image. Moreover, in problems such as classification and recognition of non-rigid objects, the agreement between model and image is even less predictable. <p> The solution in the affine case is simpler than that of the rigid case because the quadratic constraints imposed in the rigid case are not taken into account, enabling the construction of a closed-form solution. At least six points are required to find an affine solution under perspective projection <ref> [4] </ref>, and four are required under orthographic projection [9]. The affine measure bounds the rigid measure from below.

Reference-contexts: While the use of few correspondences is advantageous for recognizing objects in polynomial time complexity while overcoming partial occlusion, it may often yield errors in estimating the distance between models and images (see, e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>). Therefore, typical algorithms often try, after obtaining an initial alignment, to extend the match with additional correspondences (e.g., [4]). The bounds derived on the image metric may be used at this stage to evaluate potential correspondences.
