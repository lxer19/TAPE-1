Abstract: IBM Research Report RJ 9840, May 1994. Submitted to IEEE Computer Society Press, Proc. Workshop on Online Access to Digital Libraries Abstract: The overall workshop goals were: to define those digital library parameters which especially influence issues of access to, retrieval of, and interaction with information; to identify key problems which must be solved to make digital library service an effective reality; to identify a general structure or framework for integrating research and solutions; and to propose and encourage specific, high-priority research directions within such a framework. We report the deliberations of a subgroup focusing on distributed data service taxonomy and digital library system requirements. After a prelude delimiting what we mean by Digital Library ( DL) , we suggest that the evolving distributed resource manager and application enabler concepts provide an organizing basis for offerings from which each data custodian and each end user can choose modules suiting his needs and preferences. We make a start towards identifying module classes and pointing out existing and needed requirements analyses. _____________________________________________________ The opinions, reflections, and ideas presented in this paper represent only the coauthors individual and collected thoughts, and should not be construed to represent views of their respective organizations.
