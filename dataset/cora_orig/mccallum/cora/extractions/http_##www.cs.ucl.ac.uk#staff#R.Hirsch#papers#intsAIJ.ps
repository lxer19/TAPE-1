Title: Relation Algebras of Intervals  
Author: Robin Hirsch 
Date: October 27, 1995  
Abstract: Given a representation of a relation algebra we construct relation algebras of pairs and of intervals. If the representation happens to be complete, homogeneous and fully universal then the pair and interval algebras can be constructed direct from the relation algebra. If, further, the original relation algebra is !-categorical we show that the interval algebra is too. The complexity of relation algebras is studied and it is shown that every pair algebra with infinite representations is intractable. Applications include constructing an interval algebra that combines metric and interval expressivity.

Reference-contexts: The intractability of the Allen Interval Algebra has been problematic in temporal reasoning and in applications to databases and planning <ref> [AK83] </ref>. It might be hoped that there are other interval algebras that are tractable and yet more expressive than point-based relation algebras.

Reference-contexts: One of the most powerful algebraic tools for temporal reasoning is relation algebra.

Reference-contexts: The composition table can be found in [All83]. We will see later that it has only one countable representation namely ordered pairs of rationals (p; q) with p less than q. This representation also turns out to be normal. * The metric point system M of <ref> [DMP91] </ref> consists of finite unions of basic relations R (i) where i is a real interval with rational endpoints (open, closed or semi-open). <p> But if we restrict to certain fragments of the full language we obtain the following results. * A network with only elementary metric interval relations on the arcs (no disjuncts) can be checked in cubic time. This follows from the proof in <ref> [DMP91] </ref> that computing the transitive closure of an M-network with only one interval on each arc (in their terminology an STP), can be done in cubic time, and computes the minimal network. <p> may give a useful first approximation for a consistency checker which then proceeds by brute force to test each choice of disjunctions for consistency. (The constraint technology will clearly be useful here.) 7.4 Proof that the fixpoint algorithm terminates on Temporal Con straint Problems (TCPs) A TCP is defined in <ref> [DMP91] </ref> as an M 0 -network where the metric constraint on an edge is a finite union of intervals, possibly with irrational endpoints. e.g. <p> Let us gloss over the problem that algorithms do not handle real numbers as these are not all finitely representable and answer an open problem raised in <ref> [DMP91] </ref> THEOREM 13 The fixpoint algorithm (page 18) always terminates finitely. PROOF: One iteration of the algorithm takes some triangle (a; b; c) from the network N and replaces N (a; c) by N (a; c) " (N (a; b) fl N (b; c)). <p> This allows us to construct a metric interval algebra from the metric system M. This representation permits the expressing of Allen type disjuncts like if&lt;; &gt;gj. It is thus more expressive than other systems that allow quantitative, metric information. As with these systems <ref> [DMP91] </ref> the propagation algorithm will be complete and of cubic complexity if there are no disjuncts but its performance in general is intractable. We have shown that a large class of relation algebras, the pair algebras with infinite representations, are all intractable.

Reference-contexts: October 27, 1995 3 Definition A representation is normal if it is complete, fully universal and homogeneous. In <ref> [Hir94] </ref> it is shown that a relation algebra has a normal representation if and only if its atomic networks form an amalgamation class but the concept of amalgamation is not needed here. <p> the fact that a simple M-network N (a transitively closed M-network with only one interval on each edge) has the extension property for any subnetwork L of N it can be shown that any embedding of L into Q can be extended to an embedding of N to Q (see <ref> [Hir94] </ref> for the details). 7.2 Expressive Power This system is capable of expressing all of Allen's interval relations e.g. `overlaps' is written as (0; 1) (0; 1) .

Reference-contexts: Firstly, it uses the same uniform representation for all relations. There is no need to refer to a special table when dealing with an interval constraint and a separate table for metrics. All constraints are represented as matrices and compositions are calculated by matrix multiplication. By contrast, <ref> [KL91, Lad89, Mei91] </ref> are all essentially hybrid systems which handle metric and interval information separately and translate from one to the other. The other advantage of M 2 is its expressive power.

The next corollary was proved first in <ref> [LM87] </ref> but follows here from a more general result. 7 Recall that we can drop the D and simply call the representation X.
