Abstract: We investigate the query complexity of exact learning in the membership and (proper) equivalence query model. We give a complete characterization of concept classes that are learnable with a polynomial number of polynomial sized queries in this model. We give applications of this characterization, including results on learning a natural subclass of DNF formulas, and on learning with membership queries alone. Query complexity has previously been used to prove lower bounds on the time complexity of exact learning. We show a new relationship between query complexity and time complexity in exact learning: If any "honest" class is exactly and properly learnable with polynomial query complexity, but not learnable in polynomial time, then P 6= NP. In particular, we show that an honest class is exactly polynomial-query learnable if and only if it is learnable using an oracle for p

Reference-contexts: In fact, the above proof combines elements from two different kinds of proofs of non-learnability|the information-theoretical proof [4] that classes that possess the approximate fingerprint property are not learnable with equivalence queries alone, and the complexity-theoretical proofs <ref> [1, 27] </ref> that classes for which the representation problem is hard are not learnable in polynomial time with equivalence and membership queries. The above two theorems immediately imply the following corollary.

Reference-contexts: Second, research has revealed that there are many interesting concept classes that are not efficiently learnable with either membership or equivalence queries alone, but that are efficiently learnable with both kinds of queries <ref> [2, 5, 6, 18, 28] </ref>. Equivalence queries may be classified as being proper or improper. In a proper equivalence query, the hypothesis proposed must be from the same class as the target concept. <p> Since this result follows from the fact that the class is polynomial-time learnable <ref> [2, 28] </ref>, the proof below is intended only to illustrate that a simple proof of polynomial-query learnability can be obtained by showing that a concept class has certificates.

From the above, it follows that if a language L is not consistent with any DFA of p (m; n) = m states over n , then there exists a set Q of m + 1 pairwise n-inequivalent strings in n .

Reference-contexts: This parameter, called the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for learnability with a reasonably small (i.e., polynomial) sample size. In this paper, we give a similar characterization for efficient learning in the second framework. The second framework, developed primarily by Angluin <ref> [3] </ref>, concerns itself with exact learning with queries. Of the many kinds of queries considered by Angluin, membership and equivalence queries have established themselves as the standard combination to be used for exact learning. There are many reasons for this. <p> Let C be a class of Boolean concepts defined by a representation class R. Consider the following standard Majority learning algorithm. (This algorithm is described, for example, 5 in <ref> [3] </ref>. It is also called the halving algorithm.) Assuming that the learner is allowed arbitrary hypotheses as inputs to equivalence queries, the algorithm works as follows: Because C is a Boolean concept class, it is given as input n, the number of variables on which the target f is defined.

Reference-contexts: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for exact learning with a polynomial number of equivalence and membership queries. There are many results in learning theory that are related to our work. For example, Angluin <ref> [4] </ref> showed that the presence of the approximate fingerprint property in concept classes is a sufficient condition for non-learnability with equivalence queries alone. Recently, Gavalda [16] proved the converse|the absence of the approximate fingerprint property is a sufficient condition for learnability with a polynomial number of equivalence queries. <p> Section 5 shows that "honest" classes that are polynomial-query learnable are also learnable at least in the polynomial-time hierarchy. Section 6 gives some applications of our characterization and finally, Section 7 deals with exact learning using only membership queries. 2 Definitions We closely follow Angluin's <ref> [4] </ref> terminology. Let be an alphabet. Then fl denotes the set of all finite-length strings over , n denotes the set of all strings over of length at most n, and n denotes the set of all strings over of length exactly n. <p> The contrapositive of the above theorem gives a non-learnability result: If R does not have polynomial certificates, then R is not polynomial-query learnable. In fact, the above proof combines elements from two different kinds of proofs of non-learnability|the information-theoretical proof <ref> [4] </ref> that classes that possess the approximate fingerprint property are not learnable with equivalence queries alone, and the complexity-theoretical proofs [1, 27] that classes for which the representation problem is hard are not learnable in polynomial time with equivalence and membership queries. <p> The basic idea is to use the probabilistic method [15] to prove the existence of polynomial certificates for this class. The result then follows from Corollary 1. A rigorous definition of the representation class can be easily worked out along the lines of <ref> [4] </ref>. A Boolean variable v or its complement v is called a literal. A conjunction of literals is a term. A disjunction of terms is called a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formula.

Reference-contexts: However, it is easy to prove that this decision problem is in NP " co-NP. 8 Conclusions We have presented a characterization of exact learning with a minimally adequate teacher. The characterization suggests many new questions. For example, Angluin and Kharitonov <ref> [7] </ref> proved that many concept classes|NFA, CFG, Boolean Formulas, finite unions and intersections of DFA|are not even predictable with membership queries, given cryptographic assumptions. Do any of these classes have polynomial certificates? If they do not, we have an assumption-free proof that they are not exactly learnable with queries.

Reference-contexts: We give a few applications of our characterization, including a proof that the concept class of functions whose DNF and CNF sizes are polynomially related is polynomial-query learnable with equivalence and membership queries. Bshouty <ref> [12] </ref> has already shown that this concept class is learnable in polynomial time if one is allowed to use depth-three formulas as hypotheses in equivalence queries; our result shows that DNF (or CNF) hypotheses suffice for polynomial-query learning. Another application emerges when we consider projection-closed concept classes.

Reference-contexts: The proof of certificates could then direct the search for an efficient polynomial time learning algorithm. We need more applications of the characterization to decide if this really is a viable approach. Bshouty <ref> [13] </ref> and Hegedus [19] have observed that a concept class is learnable with a polynomial number of membership queries if and only if it has polynomial teaching dimension and has polynomial certificates. (The proof follows along the same lines as the proof of Theorem 8.) Moreover, Hegedus has developed this further <p> Bshouty <ref> [13] </ref> has also noted the following interesting relationship of polynomial query learnability to the decision problem of whether a given representation of a concept is of smallest size.

Reference-contexts: Kannan [21] gave a different kind of sufficient condition for learnabil-ity with a polynomial number of improper equivalence and membership queries|that the hypothesis class contain the target class and be closed under union and intersection. This result was refined in <ref> [14] </ref> to show that membership queries are not needed in this process|if the hypothesis class satisfies the required closure conditions, then the target class is learnable with equivalence queries alone. Our main results are as follows. <p> Since many natural concept classes are projection-closed we expect that this result will have many applications. We give one new application: the concept class of Boolean formulas representable as both log n-DNF and log n-CNF formulas has polynomial teaching dimension. Bshouty et al. <ref> [14] </ref> have shown that this class is learnable as depth-three formulas using membership queries and an NP-oracle; our result shows that the class is learnable in polynomial time as a (n; 2 log n) universal set representation using membership queries. <p> a number of membership queries at most a polynomial in maxft (f ); t (f )g| one can construct a specification set for f containing at most n + 1 assignments for each prime implicant of f and f . (This query bound was previously shown using other methods in <ref> [14] </ref> and [9]). A common example of a class that is not polynomial membership query learnable is the class of monomials. A monomial is a single term DNF formula. <p> More generally, Q contains the class of log n-depth branching programs, which is also polynomial-query learnable as a consequence of Theorem 9. Bshouty et al. <ref> [14] </ref> used the Monotone Theory to show that the class Q itself is learnable with membership queries and an NP-oracle, in a representation of depth-three Boolean formulas.

Reference-contexts: As another application of our characterization, we now show that Boolean functions with bounded DNF and CNF sizes are polynomial-query learnable as DNF formulas (or as CNF formulas). The basic idea is to use the probabilistic method <ref> [15] </ref> to prove the existence of polynomial certificates for this class. The result then follows from Corollary 1. A rigorous definition of the representation class can be easily worked out along the lines of [4]. A Boolean variable v or its complement v is called a literal. <p> A straightforward application of the probabilistic method <ref> [15] </ref> shows that there is a (n; k)-universal set of size t = O (k2 k log n). Naor and Naor [26] show that a (n; k)-universal set of size t = O (k2 3k log n) can be constructed in time polynomial in n and 2 k .

Reference-contexts: There are many results in learning theory that are related to our work. For example, Angluin [4] showed that the presence of the approximate fingerprint property in concept classes is a sufficient condition for non-learnability with equivalence queries alone. Recently, Gavalda <ref> [16] </ref> proved the converse|the absence of the approximate fingerprint property is a sufficient condition for learnability with a polynomial number of equivalence queries. Goldman and Kearns [17] showed that if a concept class is learnable with a polynomial number of membership queries alone, then it has polynomial teaching dimension. <p> First, the preference of a pseudo-majority function over a true majority function comes about from the crucial observation (as in Gavalda <ref> [16] </ref>) that a good approximation of the majority concept suffices to ensure that the learning algorithm uses a polynomial number of queries.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Gavalda [16] proved the converse|the absence of the approximate fingerprint property is a sufficient condition for learnability with a polynomial number of equivalence queries. Goldman and Kearns <ref> [17] </ref> showed that if a concept class is learnable with a polynomial number of membership queries alone, then it has polynomial teaching dimension. <p> By the characterization mentioned above, C is polynomial-query learnable with equivalence and membership queries. However, there is more: we show that equivalence queries are not needed at all here! In other words, for projection-closed Boolean concept classes, Goldman and Kearns' <ref> [17] </ref> characterization of polynomial teaching dimension as a necessary condition for polynomial-query learnability with membership queries is also a sufficient condition. Since many natural concept classes are projection-closed we expect that this result will have many applications. <p> Since the "only if" part of the proof follows from Goldman and Kearns <ref> [17] </ref>, we prove only the "if" part. Let C = m1;n1 C m;n be a Boolean concept class defined by a representation class R, where C m;n is the set of Boolean concepts on n variables that have a representation in R of size no greater than m. <p> A specification set for c 2 C (n) is a set X of assignments such that no other concept in C (n) is consistent with c over X. This corresponds to the notion of a specifying sample in 18 [8] and teaching sequence in <ref> [17] </ref>, and is also related to work of Shinohara and Miyano [29]. <p> Thus the new class has teaching dimension at most 2n, and consequently monotone decision lists are polynomial membership query learnable. In fact, a polynomial-time membership query algorithm can easily be derived from the teaching dimension proof in <ref> [17] </ref>. We now show that the class of log n-DNF " log n-CNF formulas is polynomial membership query learnable. A k-DNF formula is a DNF formula in which every term has at most k literals.
