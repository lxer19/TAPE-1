Reference-contexts: This is directly related to the trade-off between high convergence velocity and high probability to find a global optimum in case of a multimodal problem, which is a well-known problem in current research concerning Evolutionary Algorithms <ref> [Bak85, Gol89, Sch81, Whi89] </ref>.

At present the following selection schemes exist: * Proportional Selection [Hol75]: p s (a t i )= j=1 j ) * Linear Ranking <ref> [Bak85] </ref>: p s (a t 1 i 1 where min = 2 max and 1 max 2. * (,)-Uniform Ranking [Sch81]: p s (a t 0 ; &lt; i While the latter two schemes are rank-based (i.e. instead of the actual fitness their rank-index i is used), proportional selection is directly <p> For ranking the usual setting of max = 1:1 (maximum expected value) was chosen according to <ref> [Bak85] </ref>. Different values of 2 f5; 10; 15; 20; 30; 40; 50g have been used for the test runs, and for a comparison the best values in each generation are plotted. The results are based on the averaged values of 10 runs in each case.

Reference-contexts: In this paper the generic term Evolutionary Algorithms is used to denote such algorithms with the common features of a population of individuals which undergo Darwinian selection of the fitter individuals and which are subject to mutation and sexual recombination processes <ref> [BH91, HB91] </ref>. The selection mechanism of such algorithms plays an important role for driving the search towards better individuals on the one hand and for maintaining a high genotypic diversity of the population on the other hand.

Reference-contexts: Better adapted settings of the i are expected to result in a better performance of the x i with respect to the objective function. Hence, selection automatically favours advantageous settings of the strategy parameters i . A detailed description of ESs may be found in <ref> [BHS91] </ref>. Each curve in figure 6 shows the best solution obtained after 250 generations for a particular selection scheme with respect to various degrees of extinctiveness. Like for the other experiments a population size of = 50 was chosen; all values are averaged over 10 runs.

Reference-contexts: For f 1 a high convergence velocity is expected to be sufficient to approach the optimum, while for f 7 a more explorative behaviour of the algorithm would give a chance to find the global optimum. To obtain the results, a modified version of Grefenstette's GENESIS-GA <ref> [Gre87] </ref> was used here. <p> b = l j=1 0 B X ff t i;j ; i=1 i;j =1 i;j C A (4) 1 ; : : : ; a t k = (ff t k;l ) 8t 0 b indicates the average percentage of the most prominent value in each position of the individuals <ref> [Gre87] </ref>. Smaller (larger) values of b indicate higher (lower) genotypic diversity. The preservative linear ranking mechanism shows a fundamentally larger genotypic diversity than the extinctive ones (left part of figure 5). This is the property which verifies the very slow convergence behaviour of such a selection mechanism.

Reference-contexts: A selection scheme which enforces a life time of just one generation for each individual regardless of its fitness is referred to as pure selection. In an elitist selection scheme some or all of the parents are allowed to undergo selection with their offspring <ref> [Jon75] </ref>.

The setting (= 1=5) emphasizes on the convergence speed for unimodal problems; for multimodal problems this ratio should be much higher in order to allow for the exploration of the search space to some extent. <p> The major improvement is introduced by the idea of extinctive selection. This result can be interpreted as an indication of the validity of Schwefel's result for an optimum setting of the ratio = in case of f 1 <ref> [Sch81] </ref> not only for ESs, but also for GAs. <p> Name Description Dim.

Evolution Strategies (ESs) work on a phenotypic level, i.e. they operate directly on the set of real-valued object variables x i . Mutation is realized by adding to each x i a normally distributed random number with expected value 0 and standard deviation i . <p> In case of the unimodal function f 1 a high rate of convergence is required for optimal performance. For ranking this is achieved by a setting of = 1=5, which is pretty close to the theoretical results <ref> [Sch81] </ref>. The curves for f 1 also partially meet the expectation that a "harder" selection scheme (linear ranking) performs better than a "softer" one (uniform ranking). <p> As shown by Schwefel in the framework of Evolution Strategies <ref> [Sch81] </ref> the self-learning of strategy parameters provides a powerful mechanism of internal adaptation of the algorithm with respect to the objective function topology. This is often referred to as second-level learning and provides an alternative to the other approach of using a meta-level control algorithm as desribed in [Gre86, GBGK89].
