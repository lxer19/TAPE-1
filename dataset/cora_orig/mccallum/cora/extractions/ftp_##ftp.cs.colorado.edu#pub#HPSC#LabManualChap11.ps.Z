Abstract: Here we study some of the issues concerned with using a distributed-memory MIMD computer to treat the molecular dynamics problem. We use the one-dimensional model with Hooke's Law forces and Verlet's algorithm. This provides an introduction to the problem of running the MD model on an asynchronous multiprocessor, to the communication problems that arise, and to the problem of making the computation efficient. The relatively large amount of time required to send messages between processors on a distributed-memory MIMD computer, compared with the arithmetic operation time, means that the work must be organized in such a way that the number of arithmetic operations per message is high. The solution of the equations of motion requires some message passing at every time step; therefore it is important to insure that each processor performs many arithmetic operations per time step. Otherwise message passing time dominates the computation, and we might as well run the computation on a single processor. We get a first-hand look at this in the examples and exercises that follow. The DM-MIMD computer that we use is the iPSC/2.
