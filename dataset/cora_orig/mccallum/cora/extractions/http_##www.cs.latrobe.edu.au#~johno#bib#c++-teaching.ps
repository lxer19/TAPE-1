Title: Incorporating an Object-Oriented Programming Language into the First Year of a Software Engineering Education

Abstract: The paper describes how the object-oriented implementation language C++ has been incorporated into the first year of the software engineering curriculum in the School of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at La Trobe University. The reasons for choosing an object-oriented language are discussed, as well as the reasons for selecting C++ in particular. A revised course structure is presented that is based on an exercise in evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of C++ as a first-year language. The resulting course structure will provide a better framework of learning for software engineering students.

Reference-contexts: In this degree students may specialize in a software engineering stream. Within both degrees, software engineering is taught in all years. For example, the common first-year subject CS1A includes 15 software engineering lectures in second semester. Students in both degrees complete a third-year software engineering project <ref> [3] </ref> where students work in groups of five or six on a year-long project that takes them through the full range of the software engineering lifecycle including analysis, specification, design, implementation, testing, and documentation. The paper describes how an object-oriented language was added to the existing curriculum. <p> This is partially true. However, students spend precious time learning syntactic details of these languages instead of the real content of the courses. In addition, students often develop bad habits when learning languages "on the run". 4. In the third-year software engineering project taught in the department <ref> [3] </ref>, an increasing number of students wish to use object-oriented analysis and design techniques in their project.

Reference-contexts: Although modern courses aim to teach the concept of programming rather than a specific language, the actual language used affects learning and how students program in later years [1][2]. The School of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at La Trobe University currently uses Pascal <ref> [4] </ref> as its first year language. In the past few years however the school (along with many other departments worldwide) has searched for an alternative choice for the first-year language, especially for a language with object-oriented features. There are five main reasons for the move from Pascal: 1.

Reference-contexts: It was felt that an alternative "new" language would require all students to focus on the material and enhance their learning. 3. Courses beyond first year prefer not to use Pascal. For example, operating system courses are most naturally taught using a language such as C <ref> [5] </ref> with system programming features. Although the computer systems engineering students all do components on C and C++ after learning Pascal, the majority of the class (doing the Bachelor of Science) have no formal instruction in these languages.

Reference-contexts: In addition, students often develop bad habits when learning languages "on the run". 4. In the third-year software engineering project taught in the department [3], an increasing number of students wish to use object-oriented analysis and design techniques in their project. It has been observed <ref> [6] </ref> that students have greater understanding and produce better results with object-oriented analysis and design if they know an object-oriented language and if they implement their solution using an object-oriented language.
