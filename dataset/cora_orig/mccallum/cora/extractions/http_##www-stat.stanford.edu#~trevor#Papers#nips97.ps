Title: Classification by Pairwise Coupling  
Author: Trevor Hastie Robert Tibshirani 
Address: Toronto  
Affiliation: Stanford University and  University of  
Abstract: We discuss a strategy for polychotomous classification that involves estimating class probabilities for each pair of classes, and then coupling the estimates together. The coupling model is similar to the Bradley-Terry method for paired comparisons. We study the nature of the class probability estimates that arise, and examine the performance of the procedure in real and simulated datasets. Classifiers used include linear discriminants, nearest neighbors, and the support vector machine.

Reference-contexts: This is clear since r 12 &gt; :5 and r 23 &gt; :5, but also r 31 &gt; :5. The model Prob (A i jA i or A j ) = p j =(p i + p j ) forms the basis for the Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons <ref> (Bradley & Terry 1952) </ref>. In this paper we fit this model by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler distance criterion to find the best approximation ^r ij = ^p i =( ^p i + ^p j ) to a given set of r ij 's.
