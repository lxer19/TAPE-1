Abstract: Spring meshes have been used to model elastic material by numerous researchers, with skin, textiles, and soft tissue being typical applications. However, given a specified set of elastic material properties, the question of whether a particular spring mesh accurately simulates those properties, has been largely ignored in the literature. In two dimensions, given a discretization of a membrane as a triangle mesh, the standard finite element method analyzes each triangle approximately as a membrane with specified elastic properties, computing stresses and strains. An alternative is to regard each edge as a spring, assuming the springs are connected by "pin-joints" at the vertices of the discretization. This alternative, called a "spring mesh", is computationally more attractive. Previous reports on the technique are silent on the subject of assigning stiffness to the various springs. This paper shows that assigning the same stiffness to all springs badly fails to simulate a uniform elastic membrane, for equilibrium calculations. A formula for spring stiffness that provides a more accurate simulation is then derived. Its accuracy is demonstrated on test and practical mesh examples. It is also shown that an exact simulation is not possible, in general.

Reference-contexts: Stretching or compressing an element from its "rest length" produces a one-dimensional stress. We shall begin with a planar arrangement, with linear elasticity. This is one of the earliest problems to be analyzed with the finite element method <ref> [TCMT56] </ref>. Let us consider the same triangle as above: edges (p; q), (q; r), and (r; p), in their rest positions. In addition, we specify the rest lengths and spring stiffness coefficients as L qp , k qp , etc.

Reference-contexts: worst case are discussed. 2 2 Background Although a rich literature exists on finite element methods for engineering elasticity, this literature has considered mainly materials that undergo very little deformation within their elastic limits, such as metals, and is more concerned with distribution of forces, rather than the deformation itself <ref> [TG51, Whi85, ZT89] </ref>. Computer graphics applications are typically more concerned with observable deformations of less rigid materials, such as skin, other soft tissue, fabrics, inflated balls, etc. [TPBF87, TF88, TW88, TW90, VCMT95, LTW95, KGC + 96]. <p> Again, experimental results confirm the accuracy of this formula on test meshes, as well as practical meshes (Section 7). 3 Isotropic Elastic Materials For an isotropic, linearly elastic material, the relationship between stress and strain depends on two parameters of elasticity, called Young's modulus (E) and the Poisson coefficient (-) <ref> [TG51] </ref>. These parameters may vary by position in the material, but if they do not we say the material is uniform. For a membrane of constant thickness t, we write E 2 = Et, so that E 2 is the "two-dimensional Young's modulus". <p> All natural materials have - 0. The assumption of incompressibility implies - = 0:50. Timoshenko and Goodier recommend using - = 0:25 for "most materials" <ref> [TG51] </ref>. 4 Modeling Elastic Membranes In elasticity terminology, a membrane is an idealized two-dimensional elastic material for which forces needed to bend the surface are negligible in comparison to those needed to stretch or compress it. The simplest case is a planar membrane. <p> direction , denoted as , is given by Eq. 5 = cos 2 uu + sin 2 vv (19) Next, vv can be eliminated from the above equation by use of Eq. 15, giving: = (1 + -) cos fl + (1 -)(cos (ff fi)) Now, the boundary condition requires <ref> [TG51] </ref> = a sin fi f (21) Combining Eqs. 15-21, we obtain f = E 2 cos (fl=2) 1 - uu uu (22) k c 2 sin (fl=2) (1 + -) cos fl + (1 -) cos (ff fi) (23) Solving for k c : k c = (1 -2 )
