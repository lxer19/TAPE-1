Abstract: In this paper we investigate the phenomenon of multi-parent reproduction, i.e. we study recombination mechanisms where an arbitrary n &gt; 1 number of parents participate in creating children. In particular, we discuss scanning crossover that generalizes the standard uniform crossover and diagonal crossover that generalizes 1-point crossover, and study the effects of different number of parents on the GA behavior. We conduct experiments on tough function optimization problems and observe that by multi-parent operators the performance of GAs can be enhanced significantly. We also give a theoretical foundation by showing how these operators work on distributions.

Reference-contexts: Using binary operators, i.e. sexual reproduction, is inherent to GAs, while this is not the case in ES and EP. There are researchers who question the usefulness of sex in Evolutionary Computation, and indeed, in some experimental comparisons ES and EP exhibit better performance then GAs, <ref> [1] </ref>. Some recent publications show that GAs can be enhanced by new features, out of the traditional GAs paradigm, such as Lamarckian/Baldwinian effects or by applying a problem decomposition, [9], [11]. In this paper we follow another approach.

Reference-contexts: The main goals of this paper are: present two multi-parent recombination mechanisms: scanning crossover and diagonal crossover; study the effect of using more than 2 parents on the behavior of the GA for both mechanisms; compare scanning crossover to diagonal crossover. The paper <ref> [2] </ref> just shows empirical results regarding scanning crossover combined with a generational genetic algorithm using fitness proportional selection. The structure of the paper is the following. After the Introduction we give a description of (different versions of) the scanning crossover mechanism and the diagonal crossover. <p> Finally, in Section 6, we draw our conclusions and give an explanation of the results. 2 Multi-parent recombination mechanisms 2.1 Scanning crossover The simplest form of the scanning crossover mechanism studied in <ref> [2] </ref> works by taking n parent strings and creating one child through investigating the j-th (j = 1; :::; k, where k is the chromosome length) gene of the parents and chosing one of them to be the j-th gene of the child. <p> Therefore, scanning crossover is very well suited for being enriched with heuristics, moreover the presence and the influence of the incorporated heuristics is explicit. Let us note that the scanning crossover operator can also be adjusted for order based representation very easily as it is illustrated in <ref> [2] </ref>. In this paper we restrict ourselves to uniform scanning crossover, where the allele that is inserted in the child is chosen randomly by giving an equal chance to each parent to deliver its allele. Recall that the classical uniform crossover is a very disruptive operator. <p> We measured speed by the total number of function evaluations (averaged over all runs). Let us note that the results on uniform scanning crossover deviate from those presented in <ref> [2] </ref> because there a generational GA with fitness proportional selection was used.

Reference-contexts: For example if x = 10110 and i = f1; 2; 5g, then x 0 = 1 1 1 1 1 and R x;i = 1 1 1 = 1. Walsh products are used in the literature on genetic algorithms, for example to construct deceptive functions <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: All these functions, except for the F2 function, have a large number of local optima, which make those functions difficult to optimize. The defining formulas of these functions can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>, [6], [9] and [11]. For each function we applied binary representation; the most important properties of the test functions and their representation are summarized in Table 1. Let us remark that the Michalewicz function is to be maximized, while all the others are to be minimized.

Efficiency on the Griewangk and the Schwefel functions 5 Distributions In this section we consider the effect of uniform scanning crossover and diagonal crossover on distributions. This gives a theoretical basis for the comparison of these operators. This section is based on the paper <ref> [5] </ref>, and we generalize here the results of that paper in that we give also formulae for uniform scanning crossover and diagonal crossover (and not only for uniform crossover and 1-point crossover). A population will be regarded as a probability distribution over chromosomes.

The results show that there are very promising possibilities within the GA paradigm.
