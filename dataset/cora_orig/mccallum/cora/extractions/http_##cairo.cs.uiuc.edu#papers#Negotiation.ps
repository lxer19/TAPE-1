Reference-contexts: The subsystem which coordinates these steps in our end-point architecture is called QoS Broker <ref> [1] </ref>. The end result of the multimedia call set-up are `contracted' QoS values and allocated resources. These values and assigned resources are used by the multimedia transmission protocols. 3 QoS Negotiation QoS negotiation is used to obtain common QoS parameter values among different system components during the multimedia call set-up.

Reference-contexts: The reliability of these data is crucial for the reliable way of moving the slave robot arm. Therefore, the transmission protocol will use Forward Error Correction (FEC) <ref> [2] </ref>, but in a hierarchical form which means. The robotics data coming from the robotics application are demultiplexed at the application subsystem level and to each floating point number is appended checksum, element number in the sensor data vector (e.g., 4th element) and importance (priority) value.
