Abstract: End-to-end protocols measure network characteristics and react based on their estimates of network performance. Network dynamics can alter the topology significantly, and thereby affect protocol operation. Topology changes may result in routing pathologies (such as route loops, packet interleaving), changes to the end-to-end path characteristics, network partition etc, that then impact the performance of end-to-end protocols. This paper presents methodologies to evaluate an end-to-end protocol in the presence of network dynamics using a simulator. In the paper, we evaluate a reliable multicast transport protocol over dynamic topologies and study its adaptivity to topology change. We present a systematic evaluation of the adaptive timer mechanisms in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM). The timer mechanisms are evaluated under simple topology changes, as well as under network partition conditions. The paper concludes by posing a number of open research questions about the behaviour of different reliable multicast mechanisms when fl The work of K. Varadhan and D.

Reference-contexts: [15] source adjusts its data rate based on its estimate of the available bandwidth and congestion; Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast (RLM) [12] requires a group member to estimate the level of congestion, and decide the amount of data that it can receive at any given time; in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [2] </ref>, every group member estimates the rtt to all other group members, for use in its error recovery mechanisms. <p> Shankar et al.[17] in analyzing different routing protocols, describe the impact of network dynamics on the throughput and delay of a simple window based transport protocol. Individual protocol designers sometimes suggest how their protocol should perform in the presence of topology changes <ref> [2] </ref>; however, we know of no systematic study of the performance and evaluation of end-to-end protocols over dynamic topologies. Unicast protocols, such as TCP, are only affected by changes in the topology if the changes occur on the path between the two end-points. <p> We close with a discussion of a number of promising research issues related to the impact of network dynamics on reliable multicast mechanisms (Section 4). 2. Scalable Reliable Multicast: An Overview In this section, we give a brief overview of Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [2] </ref>. In SRM, active sources in a multicast group periodically send data to the group, as specified by the application. Each unit of data is identified by the tuple hsource id, message sequence numberi; this corresponds to the notion of naming in Application Data Units model used in [2]. <p> Multicast (SRM) <ref> [2] </ref>. In SRM, active sources in a multicast group periodically send data to the group, as specified by the application. Each unit of data is identified by the tuple hsource id, message sequence numberi; this corresponds to the notion of naming in Application Data Units model used in [2]. The source tags each unit of data with its unique identifier. In addition, every member of the group periodically sends session messages specifying the amount of data it has received from each source. <p> This topology is a very simple model of a network with alternate paths for fallback (or fallback paths). Such fallback paths are used in the event of failure of some of the other paths in the network. When the topology is stable, our topology resembles a string topology <ref> [2] </ref>. These topologies stress the deterministic component of the SRM timers. There are other topologies that stress other aspects of the protocol, or model more realistic topologies. We have left the studies on these other topologies for future study. <p> Link h4, 5i will drop alternate packets seen in this periodic flood as well, and hence, over a period of time, there may not be a one-to-one correlation between packets dropped on Link h1,2i and Link h4,5i. in units of rtt per loss An alternate measure, used in <ref> [2] </ref>, is to normalize the recovery delay at a node, and express it in units of that node's rtt. In particular, for any given loss, we determine the last node to receive the repair, and normalize the delay experienced by that node its estimate of the rtt to the source. <p> On the other hand, the delay is within 1rtt for that node, when the nodes use adaptive timers (shown plotted with + markers). These figures illustrate some of the original motivation in <ref> [2] </ref> for developing adaptive timer mechanisms, i.e., to reduce the recovery delay, at the expense of a marginal increase in the number of duplicate requests. We therefore look at the number of requests and repairs sent by each of timer mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: A routing protocol must then be used to compute the end-to-end connectivity after any topology change. We begin by describing our models for unicast and multicast routing. For our experiments, we have implemented a simple Distributed Bellman-Ford routing protocol in ns <ref> [11] </ref>. Our choice of parameters for the routing protocol are motivated by our desire to study the effect of topology changes on end-to-end protocol. One well-understood effect of topology change on these protocols is a transient loss of connectivity.

Reference-contexts: Common to all of these protocols is that changes to the topology can significantly change the actual network characteristics, and therefore impact the performance of the protocol, and possibly adversely affect the network. Paxson <ref> [14] </ref>, through end-to-end measurements of routing stability, tells us that in general, the stability of a particular end-to-end path is fairly high (around 60%); i.e., if, at a given instant in time, an end-to-end transport session uses a particular route from end-to-end, then there is a 60% likelihood that the session <p> More recently, Labovitz et al.[7], through measurements of inter-domain route updates at various network access points, suggests that there are a far greater number of route updates than is to be expected in a network, the size of the Internet. Paxson <ref> [14] </ref> also points out a number of routing and network pathologies that adversely affect TCP performance. By design, multi-party protocols and applications support a greater number of participants; they are used to communicate simultaneously with participants connected by diverse network paths.

Reference-contexts: idea of using scaled session messages such that nodes consume a limited amount of bandwidth when sending session messages, attempt to limit the scope of their session messages, and at the same time designate a representative node to send more frequent session messages to the entire multicast group, bears promise <ref> [18] </ref>. 3.3. Recovery after Partitions In the previous sections, we considered protocol be-haviour when the topology was stable (Section 3.1), and when the topology was dynamic, but continuously connected (Section 3.2). <p> We conjecture that there will be significant impact of network dynamics in the design of reliable multicast protocols. In particular, these protocols exploit locality in different ways, so as to improve their scalability without compromising their adaptivity. For example, scalable session messages mechanisms <ref> [18] </ref> choose representative members that will send global session messages on behalf of members in the vicinity. This involves making locality decisions about the topology, to decide the representative, and the group associated with that representative. <p> Other reliable multicast protocols use a combination of mechanisms to exploit locality. These mech anisms fall into four broad classes. (1) Designated representatives can act as proxy on behalf of members in the vicinity <ref> [8, 6, 18, 1, 5] </ref>. (2) Topologically contiguous members that share a common characteristic, such as errors due to malfunctioning link, or congestion, can form a local group to recover from the effects of that characteristic, (3) some mechanisms form a hierarchy as an additional means of scaling [6, 8, 21], <p> Examples of such self-configuration mechanisms include local error recovery groups [9], scalable session messages <ref> [18] </ref>, or designating a representative [13, 1]. These self-configuring mechanisms have to cope with group membership changes, as well as topology changes. Therefore, these mechanisms, by definition, should re configure when there is a significant change, either in group membership or topology changes.

Reference-contexts: The recovery delay observed by any node is a function of the topology. Therefore, one possible definition that we can use is the average recovery delay for a loss; this is the average of the delays observed by each of the nodes that experienced that loss <ref> [19] </ref>. The average recovery delay is also affected by the topology, which node initiates the request and which other nodes assists in the repair. These metrics can have high variability. 1 In particular, note that we are using dense-mode multicast, based on periodic flood-and-prune. <p> Therefore, in this paper, we restrict our characterisation of protocol performance to the number of request messages sent for each loss. The complete characterisation of the protocol based on the repair messages is in <ref> [19] </ref>. Figure 3 shows these plots of request messages for fixed and adaptive timers. In order to show all of the different points in the distribution, we plot the distribution as jittered dots. <p> They will set short hold-down times following the repair, and send multiple repairs, corresponding to each of the requests sent. Detailed traces of the individual losses, as well as aggregate plots of the rounds of requests and repairs confirm this behaviour <ref> [19] </ref>. We have already observed that it is critical for the error recovery mechanisms to obtain good estimates of their distances to all other members. Distance estimation in SRM is achieved through the exchange of session messages by group members. <p> Our study of the effect of protocol behaviour on the network itself showed the obvious and transient congestions following a partition healing, with increased packet drops occuring due to the congestion. This is discussed in greater detail in <ref> [19] </ref>. We group the receivers in the topology by the pattern of losses they observe for data from each of the sources. This pattern of loss depends on the location of the receiver relative to the source with respect to the dynamic link.
