Title: KOSTANT POLYNOMIALS AND THE COHOMOLOGY RING FOR  
Author: G=B SARA C. BILLEY 
Abstract: The Schubert calculus for G=B can be completely determined by a certain matrix related to the Kostant polynomials introduced in [1][Section 5]. The polynomials are defined by vanishing properties on the orbit of a regular point under the action of the Weyl group. For each element w in the Weyl group the polynomials also have non-zero values on the orbit points corresponding to elements which are larger in the Bruhat order than w. Our main theorem is an explicit formula for these values. The matrix of orbit values can be used to determine the cup product for the cohomology ring for G=B, using only linear algebra or as described in [14].

Reference-contexts: Definition 1. A Kostant polynomial K w is any element of C [h fl ] of degree l (w) (nonhomogeneous) such that K w (Ov) = 1 v = w (1.1) These polynomials were defined originally by Kostant and appear in <ref> [1, Thm. 5.9] </ref> for the finite case; later generalized by Kostant and Kumar in [14], denoted ~ w 1 in their notation. <p> Recently, Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon [15] have explained the interesting connection between the Yang-Baxter equations and the specializations of double Schubert polynomials using techniques similar to those used in Section 3. We begin with a review of a few results from the renowned paper by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand <ref> [1] </ref>. In Section 3, we introduce the nil-Coxeter algebra in order to prove that the orbit value formula is independent of the choice of reduced word. The explicit formula for the orbit values is stated as a theorem and proved in Section 4. <p> For each 1 i n, the divided difference operator @ i : R !

This theorem was also stated by Kostant and Kumar in <ref> [14] </ref> in a different form. We include the proof because it demonstrates the techniques we use to compute the Kostant polynomials. Theorem 1. <p> Proof. Each positive root fl is the sum of simple roots so the value fl (O) is also a non-negative integer. Therefore, (4.4) evaluated at O is the sum of products of non-negative integers. The following corollaries were also shown in <ref> [14] </ref>. Corollary 4.4. The orbit values K v (Ow) and K v (Ow i ) (respectively (v; w) and (v; w i )) are equal if and only if l (v) &lt; l (v i ). Proof. This follows directly from Lemma 4.2. Corollary 4.5. <p> The ~ v functions are interesting because their product expansions are related to the product expansion of the ~ K v 's, yet they are defined independent from a choice of orbit point or any quotient ideal. We use the same notation as <ref> [14] </ref> wherever possible. The exception to this rule is that we have interchanged the role of w and w 1 in all of their formulas. 12 SARA C.

The Kostant polynomials and the double Schubert polynomials <ref> [17] </ref> defined by Lascoux and Schutzenberger are closely related in the case of SL n . Let S w (X; Y ) be the double Schubert polynomial indexed by w on the two alphabets, X and Y . <p> Then ~ K w (x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n ) = S w (X; O). This fact can be proven in several ways; using the vanishing properties of the double Schubert polynomials as originally proven by Lascoux and Schutzenberger <ref> [17] </ref>, the combinatorial interpretation for the terms in a double Schubert polynomial defined by Fomin and Kirillov [6], or by divided difference equations as shown by M. Shimozono in private communication.

Reference-contexts: We give the precise connection in Remark 1 of Section 8 for all of the classical groups. Note, our main theorem in this case gives formulas for evaluating double Schubert polynomials at orbit points. These values were originally studied by Lascoux and Schutzenberger in <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. Recently, Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon [15] have explained the interesting connection between the Yang-Baxter equations and the specializations of double Schubert polynomials using techniques similar to those used in Section 3. We begin with a review of a few results from the renowned paper by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand [1].

Reference-contexts: In the case G is SL n , the Kostant polynomials are the double Schubert polynomials (multiplied by a scalar) introduced by Lascoux and Schutzenberger [17], see also <ref> [20] </ref>. We give the precise connection in Remark 1 of Section 8 for all of the classical groups. Note, our main theorem in this case gives formulas for evaluating double Schubert polynomials at orbit points. These values were originally studied by Lascoux and Schutzenberger in [18, 19]. <p> Also, since it extends to the exceptional root systems it is more complete then the existing theory of Schubert polynomials defined by Lascoux and Schutzenberger [16], see also <ref> [20, 3, 7, 9, 21] </ref> and many more. We define the orbit value function ~ v O : W ! Z to be the function with value ~ K v (Ow) = ~ v (w) on the point w 2 W . <p> BILLEY Lascoux and Schutzenberger have shown that there exists a particularly nice set of representatives called Schubert polynomials for the Schubert classes of SL n =B. This theory was founded in [16] and extended by Lascoux and Schutzenberger themselves and several other people, notably Macdonald <ref> [20] </ref>. Their choice of the top Schubert polynomial in S n is S w 0 = x n1 1 x n2 2 x n1 . These representatives are then stable under the inclusion of S n into S n+1 .

We define the orbit value function ~ v O : W ! Z to be the function with value ~ K v (Ow) = ~ v (w) on the point w 2 W . <p> Our Theorem 1 generalizes this statement for the other semisimple Lie groups. The Kostant polynomials for the other classical groups are related to the double Schubert polynomials as defined by Fulton [9] and also those defined by Pragacz and Ratajski <ref> [21] </ref>. In both cases, Graham [10] has shown the vanishing properties for the double Schubert polynomials indexed by the longest element in the Weyl group follows KOSTANT POLYNOMIALS AND THE COHOMOLOGY RING FOR G=B 17 from their geometric construction.
