Reference-contexts: Recall that we are assuming that the probability that a site is available, p, is constant and site failures are independent. So the probability that at least one site failure occurs is given by 1 p s . We <ref> [2] </ref> have measured p and found it to be approximately .95. This means that by the time NCSTRL gets to s = 90 sites, the probability of a site failure during a search is essentially one.
