Abstract: Requirements Engineering (RE) is the elicitation, analysis, classification, and design of systems and software requirements. [Palmer and Fields 1992]. The most important function of the requirements engineering process is to specify a system that will meet the users needs. The user obviously plays a key role in the success of the process as they must be involved in the elicitation and validation of the requirements to ensure that the problem is fully understood and that the requirements are accurate. It is the role of the analyst to enable the users to formalise their requirements through facilitation. This report is a detailed analysis of methods used in RE in terms of the way in which they address problems associated with RE which have been previously identified by the authors (Beckworth and Garner 1994).
