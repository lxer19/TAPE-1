Abstract: This memo describes version 1.0 of the client/server interaction of RWhois. RWhois provides a distributed system for the display of hierarchical information. This system is hierarchical by design, allowing for the reduction of a query, and the referral of the user closer to the maintainer of the information.

Reference-contexts: The underlying premise for this project has been to retain the basic functionality of the whois server and client, making all of the extensions optional. The server must respond to the original whois client, currently included with many operating systems. The RWhois client must also interact with RFC954 <ref> [RFC-954] </ref> whois servers. RFC 1714 Referral Whois Protocol (RWhois) November 1994 Williamson & Kosters [Page 2] RWhois has been designed as an extensible protocol to ensure that many uses can be accommodated. Public extensions to the protocol should be documented as RFCs. <p> However, for compatibility with older Whois clients, the query is not prefaced with the - character. Only after the client is certain that the server is an RWhois server should these directives be sent. Compatibility with RFC954 <ref> [RFC-954] </ref> whois servers is required. All directives must be terminated by &lt;LF&gt;&lt;CR&gt;. 2.2 Required Directives The following are required RWhois client directives. 2.2.1 &lt;query&gt; The query is generally the final directive sent to the server. It is the only directive that does not start with a -. <p> The cache directive allows the client to instruct the server whether or not to send cached data. The RWhois client should start with the cache turned off. The server must start with the cache turned on in order to function like the RFC954 <ref> [RFC-954] </ref> whois server. Because of the servers default, the client should send the -cache off directive during initial session setup if cached data should not be sent. Details on expiration of cache data can be found in section 3.4.3, %soa response. <p> Full (=) Give the full record output on one to many hits (defaults on one hit only). The following was added to whois post RFC954 <ref> [RFC-954] </ref> and is part of the RWhois requirements: dump (#) Display the record in a parsable format. In addition to the above, the RWhois server must accept additional pre-query directives such as Boolean queries and attribute=value query combinations. <p> This capability is required for an RWhois server. Example: last-name=williamson and first-name=scott Data Restriction Format Keywords The following restriction keywords are found in the RFC954 <ref> [RFC-954] </ref> whois server: !(handle) Query on Handle only mailbox Query on all records for person person Query on User records only host Query on Host records only domain Query on Domain records only network Query on Network Records only asn Query on Autonomous System Numbers only The RWhois server must allow
