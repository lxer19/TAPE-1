Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the classical game of Nim by placing the piles on the vertices of a simplicial complex and allowing a move to affect the piles on any set of vertices that forms a face of the complex. Under certain conditions on the complex we present a winning strategy. These conditions are satisfied, for instance, when the simplicial complex consists of the independent sets of a binary matroid. Moreover, we study four operations on a simplicial complex under which games on the complex behave nicely. We also consider particular complexes that correspond to natural generalizations of classical Nim.

Reference-contexts: The winner is the player who takes the last chip. An elegant winning strategy for this game was first described by Bouton [2]. By virtue of the simplicity of this strategy, Nim has since served as a yardstick for all impartial two-player games (see <ref> [1, 3] </ref>) in the sense that any position in such a game is equivalent to a position in Nim. In this paper we generalize the game of Nim to a finite simplicial complex . <p> The value of a position is defined recursively by v (n) = mex (fv (m) : n ! mg) ; and v (0) = 0. The value of a position is also known as the position's Grundy number or Sprague-Grundy number (see <ref> [1, 3, 10] </ref>). A game which is guaranteed to end in a finite number of moves is called short. The positions with value zero are called winning or zero positions. <p> Playing on k (V ) is equivalent to playing Nim on jV j piles with a move allowed to affect at most k 1 piles. The following proposition first appeared in [6], though Moore did not give a proof in his short paper. It is also discussed in <ref> [1, chapter 15, page 498] </ref>, [8, section 122, page 151], and [9]. the electronic journal of combinatorics 3 (1996), #R9 13 Proposition 4.7 (E. H. <p> Observe that P n;2 is a path of length n in the graph theoretic sense (see Figure 5). We may view the game on P n;2 as a generalization of the game of Kayles (see <ref> [1, chapter 4, page 81] </ref> and [3, page 127]). <p> We showed this to be the case for binary matroids, but does this property hold in general? The value of a game played on a non-connected simplicial complex is the Nim-sum (see <ref> [1, page 61] </ref>) of the values on the connected components. In particular, a position is a zero position if and only if the Nim-sum of these values is zero. However, it seems quite hard to compute the value of games on all but the simplest complexes. <p> Another generalization of Nim is Wythoff's game, see <ref> [1, page 76] </ref>. The referee of the present paper suggested the following generalization of Wythoff's game: On a simplicial complex , place a pile of chips on each vertex of .

Reference-contexts: The players take turns removing chips. In a move, a player removes any positive number of chips from one pile. The winner is the player who takes the last chip.

By virtue of the simplicity of this strategy, Nim has since served as a yardstick for all impartial two-player games (see [1, 3]) in the sense that any position in such a game is equivalent to a position in Nim.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a position is a zero position if and only if the Nim-sum of these values is zero. However, it seems quite hard to compute the value of games on all but the simplest complexes. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Jenkyns and Mayberry give a formula for the value of Moore's Nim k which is equivalent to playing on k (V ) when the set V has cardinality k + 1 (see Proposition 4.7). That is, this amounts to playing on the boundary complex of a k-dimensional simplex.
