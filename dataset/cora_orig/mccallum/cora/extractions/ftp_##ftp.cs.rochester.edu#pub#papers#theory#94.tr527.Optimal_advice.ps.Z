Abstract: Ko [Ko83] proved that the P-selective sets are in the advice class P/quadratic. We prove that the P-selective sets are in NP=linear T coNP=linear. We show this to be optimal in terms of the amount of advice needed.

Reference-contexts: We note that refining from powers of two to a k-ary token is not a new idea. Cai and Furst, in the setting of bottleneck machines ([CF91], see also the underlying paper Barrington <ref> [Bar89] </ref>) wanted to precisely describe the point at which bottleneck machines captured PSPACE, and to do this they defined a machine model in which they could speak of passing, e.g., a 5-ary token (rather than, e.g., the cruder "3 bits"). 3 Results We now turn to our results.

Proof of Proposition 3.6 (1) It is well-known that NP NP"coNP = NP and coNP NP"coNP = coNP, and by essentially the same proof it is known <ref> [HHN + 93] </ref> that FP NP"coNP singlevalued; total = NPSV total . Part (1) follows immediately from these facts and that fact that Theorem 3.1 relativizes (as, in particular, it holds relativized by each set I 2 NP coNP).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Selective sets are sets for which there is a "selector function," usually a polynomial-time deterministic or nondeterministic function, that selects which of any two given inputs is logically no less likely than the other to belong to the given set. Definition 1.1 <ref> [HNOS94] </ref> Let F C be any class of functions (possibly multivalued or partial). <p> Also of interest to us will be the NPSV-selective sets, which were first studied by Hemaspaandra, Naik, Ogihara, and Selman <ref> [HNOS94] </ref>, and the NPSV total -selective sets, which were first studied by Hemaspaandra et al.

Reference-contexts: We also show that this is optimal with respect to length of advice: sublinear advice, indeed n bits, does not suffice|even with extremely powerful advice interpreters. As historical background, we mention that lower bounds on advice date at least back to Kannan's 1982 paper <ref> [Kan82] </ref>, and a nice recent paper of Homer and Mocas [HM93] obtains a lower bound for the advice complexity of exponential time that is optimal in some oracle world.

The results just mentioned would yield a time 8 2 O (n 2 ) deterministic algorithm for finding advice strings by brute force|a time bound no better than that implicit in the result P-sel P=quadratic. To save time, we show how to save nondeterminism.

Reference-contexts: The proof seeks to wedge into a set as much information as possible (via diagonalizing against smaller amounts of information and all possible interpreters), while still maintaining the P-selectivity of the set, via a variant on a gap construction. Ladner <ref> [Lad75] </ref> pioneered the technique of putting large gaps in sets and then exploiting the gaps, and our proof is inspired by a construction that, in the context of determining the closure properties of the P-selective sets, uses gaps to establish P-selectivity [HJ].
