Reference-contexts: An informal introduction to this high-level Petri net model is given in appendix A. For a more formal introduction to this net model the reader is referred to Van der Aalst <ref> [2, 3] </ref> and Van Hee et al. [13, 14, 15]. Tasks, procedures and resource managers will be modelled by (Petri net) systems. (A system is a subnet which may communicate via connectors, see appendix A.) Control activities will be modelled by transitions. Jobs are represented by (job) tokens.

Reference-contexts: There are several commercial wfms's on the market (e.g. OPEN/workflow by Wang and WorkFlo by Olivetti) and experiments have shown that they are successful (cf. Van den Berg et al. <ref> [4] </ref>). However, none of them have the functionality that is needed. Another problem is that there is no clear definition of these systems. Moreover, there is no general conceptual model for workflow management systems, like the relational data model for most database management systems.

Reference-contexts: Petri nets have been used to model a variety of systems ranging from operating systems to logistic systems. We will see that we can use high-level Petri nets to model workflows and workflow management systems, cf. Bracchi and Pernici <ref> [6] </ref>. This is not a surprise given the fact that Petri nets have been successfully applied in the two application domains just mentioned (i.e. operating systems and logistics). Note that wfms's can be considered as operating systems that control tasks outside computers.

Reference-contexts: In fact the term `office logistics' is often used to refer to the flow of documents inside an office. There have been other attempts to model workflow in terms of Petri nets, cf. Ellis and Nutt [8], Cindio et al. <ref> [7] </ref> and Zisman [23]. Ellis and Nutt ([8]) also emphasize the need for high-level Petri nets. However, there are several differences between our approach and the approach presented in in [8], e.g. the workflow concepts and their definitions differ and another Petri net model is used.

Our approach integrates in a common formal framework three different aspects of an office: the office functional specification, the organizational structure and the communication aspects.

Control activities will be modelled by transitions. Jobs are represented by (job) tokens. <p> Note that we did this in an `object-oriented fashion'. The transitions inside a task system can be regarded as methods, the tokens exchanged between tasks and resources (or resource managers) can be seen as messages, etc. For more information on this subject the reader is referred to <ref> [13] </ref>. Another reason for using high-level Petri nets is the fact that we can use these nets for analysis purposes. We can use Petri net based analysis techniques to verify a number of properties.
