Title: Beyond Programming: A Two-Summer Computer Science Institute for Secondary Teachers  
Author: Brian Harvey 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: 1992 marks the fourth summer of the Institute for Secondary Mathematics and Computer Science Education (IFSMACSE), an NSF-sponsored program for high school teachers held at Kent State University. The program is divided into separate strands for mathematics and computer science; this paper describes the computer science strand. In its first three years, IFSMACSE has served about 240 participants, including 90 in computer science. It has, therefore, had a visible impact in Ohio and the neighboring states, especially since one component of the Institute is an Intervening Year Project in which participants bring the ideas of the Institute back to their colleagues through inservice workshops, local curriculum design, and demonstration teaching. (Participants attend the Institute during two consecutive summers.) IFSMACSE is both technically and pedagogically innovative. Its curriculum goes far beyond what is usually expected of high school teachers (or their students); in computer science, participants study both functional programming (in Logo) and procedural programming (in Pascal) paradigms, and such advanced computer science topics as automata theory and compiler construction. Our high expectations are made realistic by the heavy use of experiential and cooperative learning techniques. Participants learn by experiment, rather than by listening to lectures. In the mathematics strands as well as in computer science, we emphasize the use of programming languages as open-ended experimental media, rather than more specific "courseware." In addition to describing ways in which IFSMACSE has been successful, this paper discusses two ongoing problems. One is the difficulty that participants have with the idea of functional objects; another is the tenacity with which many participants' abstract educational theories prevent them from observing their own learning experiences clearly.
