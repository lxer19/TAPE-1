Reference-contexts: These programs work completely and properly as specified. An instructor in our department for her Masters thesis wrote an expert system that produces variations in the style of Telemann <ref> [Mer91] </ref>. The output (as well as the input) for this system is a unique system that consists of triples, each representing a chord, a rhythm and a note. Without an enormous amount of practice, this is virtually unreadable.

Reference-contexts: There are many projects in computer music that fulfill many of the above goals very well. Some of these will be described later in this paper. 3 Introduction to MIDI The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard <ref> [MID90] </ref> is today's standard for communication between digital musical instruments. It includes standards for real- time communication between instruments as well as file formats for storing musical information.
