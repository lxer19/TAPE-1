Title: A Robot Controller Using Learning by Imitation

Abstract: Roboticists have already invested considerable energy in building robot controllers which model the learning capacities of single animals. In this paper we present a new type of controller which draws upon insight from the field of imitative learning: one agent learns from perceiving and imitating the behaviour of another. We describe the architecture of an imitative learning controller and two implementations, a simulator and a robot. The learner robot follows a teacher robot through a maze and learns to associate its perceptions at locations where the teacher carries out a significant action with the action it subsequently undertakes as a result of its innate teacher-following behaviour. Such a controller limits the learning task to bouts of learning when there is something useful to be learnt. It allows a robot to learn in terms of its own perceptions, makes programming many nominally identical robots simpler, and opens the possibilities for cross-modal learning.

Reference-contexts: They have made progress in the design of reflex behaviour for robots and have started to make inroads into the field of robot learning, for example by programming robots to form associative maps of their environment or to learn from reinforcement received from the environment for successful behaviour <ref> [10, 8, 9, 12, 1] </ref>. In this paper we present a controller which utilises a new type of learning, imitative learning, whereby one robot learns how to act by perceiving and, in some sense, imitating the actions of another robot.

Reference-contexts: Once it has learned, it is able to negotiate new situations on its own. Imitative learning is a term taken from ethology, which ethologists use to describe a huge range of behaviour in animals <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. <p> We therefore adopt the following strategy. ? gmh@aifh.ed.ac.uk ?? johnde@aifh.ed.ac.uk First we allow a very general definition of "imitation" as being a phenomenon which leads to "some sort of similarity in behavior among two or more individuals" <ref> [2] </ref>. We then pick a mechanism put forward as a possible explanation of one type of imitative learning, matched dependent behaviour, and design and build a robot control system based on this.

Reference-contexts: The view of the teacher seen by Ben Hope is shown in Figure 3. Ben Hope's camera has quite a wide field of view, so we discard the upper part of the image before thresholding it and applying Haralick's iterated components algorithm (see <ref> [6] </ref>) to extract connected, labelled areas (Figure 4). The positions of the front and back of the teacher robot and the direction in which it is pointing can then be obtained by fitting ellipses to the two blobs.

Reference-contexts: Thorpe [11] suggests that contagious behaviour may result if the sight of one animal performing some innate behaviour is the stimulus which triggers this behaviour in another as in, for example, yawning in humans or flock manoeuvres in birds. On the other hand, Humphrey <ref> [7] </ref> suggests that classical conditioning could be involved: if some stimulus always releases the same behaviour in a group of animals, then that behaviour in one animal is the conditioned stimulus for the same behaviour in another. Yet more mechanisms are postulated to underlie other sorts of imitative behaviour.

Reference-contexts: Simple fear reduction in the presence of others may be taking place, so that innate behaviours are disinhibited rather than being positively activated. These mechanisms could explain such social facilitation behaviour as the tendency of chicks to peck at food more when others are around. Thorpe <ref> [11] </ref> suggests that contagious behaviour may result if the sight of one animal performing some innate behaviour is the stimulus which triggers this behaviour in another as in, for example, yawning in humans or flock manoeuvres in birds.
