Title: CAMPS: A Constraint-Based Architecture for Multiagent Planning and Scheduling

Abstract: The authors propose a new integrated architecture for distributed planning and scheduling that exploits constraints for problem decomposition and coordination. The goal is to develop an efficient method to solve densely constrained planning / scheduling problems in a distributed manner without sacrificing solution quality. The authors implemented a prototype system, called CAMPS, in which a set of intelligent agents try to coordinate their actions for "satisficing" planning / scheduling results by handling several intra-and inter-agent constraints. In this paper, the authors show the repair-based methodology for distributed planning / scheduling and the constraint-based mechanism of dynamic coalition formation among agents.

The goal of planning / scheduling is, in its broadest sense, to maximize profit of the enterprise.

Reference-contexts: Careful coordination is required at the first and fourth step: at these steps agents must cooperatively accomplish several tasks such as problem decomposition and conflict resolution. In Anchor & Ascend approach by Liu <ref> (Liu, 1996) </ref>, the specific problem structure such as bottleneck resources is used to control search for a near-optimal solution by several agents while keeping search space of the agents tractable.

Reference-contexts: And in the study of distributed scheduling, the aim of the systems has been to find a feasible solution (CORTES (Sycara, 1991)) or a satisfactory solution in terms of a simple objective (e.g. time-shift preferences in DIS-DSS <ref> (Neiman, 1994) </ref>). In those systems, a solution is built constructively by scheduling agents which communicate abstract resource profiles and meta-level information (such as lending possibility) among them. The agent interaction is hard-coded a priori in the systems and can't be adjusted during the course of problem solving.
