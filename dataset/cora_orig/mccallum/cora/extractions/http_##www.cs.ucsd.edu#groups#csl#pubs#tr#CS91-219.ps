Abstract: We report performance measurements of Internet connections between five Sequoia 2000 sites. Throughput and delay statistics are presented for various message sizes and for both daytime and nighttime. The highest throughput observed was 85 KB/s between UCSD and UCLA at night and the lowest was 1 KB/s between UCSD and DWR during the day.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Sequoia 2000 project <ref> [1] </ref> is developing computing and communications technology to support Global Change research. The goal is to build a Terabyte database of important, very large datasets to be accessible by Earth Scientists in real-time from their workstations at the Sequoia 2000 sites distributed across California.

Reference-contexts: The Measurement Tool The Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS) developed a general purpose protocol performance measurement system called the SICS Protocol Implementation Measurement System (SPIMS) <ref> [2] </ref>. Through a measurement specification language, it is possible to describe a set of experiments directed toward obtaining a desired performance metric. Two machines, connected by a computer network, using one of the protocols that SPIMS understands are required for the measurements.

Reference-contexts: The measurements were performed over relatively quiet LANs and links entirely within our lab. The T1 measurements used the TurboChannel T1 adapters <ref> [3] </ref>.
