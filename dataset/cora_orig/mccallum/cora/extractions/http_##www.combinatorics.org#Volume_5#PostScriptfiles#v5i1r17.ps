Abstract: The Galois number G n (q) is defined to be the number of subspaces of the n-dimensional vector space over the finite field GF (q). When q is prime, we prove that G n (q) is equal to the number L n (q) of n-dimensional mod q lattices, which are defined to be lattices (that is, discrete additive subgroups of n-space) contained in the integer lattice Z n and having the property that given any point P in the lattice, all points of Z n which are congruent to P mod q are also in the lattice. For each n, we prove that L n (q) is a multiplicative function of q.

Reference-contexts: We let G n = G n (q) denote the total number of vector subspaces of V n (q). The numbers G n were named the Galois numbers by Goldman and Rota <ref> [4, p. 77] </ref>.

Then it was proved in <ref> [4] </ref> that G n (q) = r=0 The correspondence mentioned above gives E (r; n; q) = n : (3) For example, E (r; 4; 2) for r = 0; 1; 2; 3; 4 is 1; 15; 35; 15 and 1, respectively. <p> Thus this paper shows that there are two different natural extensions of the Galois numbers G n (q), q prime. One extension leads to the Galois numbers G n (q) for arbitrary positive integers q, as given in <ref> [4] </ref>. In that paper a formal definition of a rref matrix over a set of q symbols is given and finite fields play no role. For each n, the numbers G n (q) are fixed polynomials in q, and the recursion (1) holds as a polynomial identity.
