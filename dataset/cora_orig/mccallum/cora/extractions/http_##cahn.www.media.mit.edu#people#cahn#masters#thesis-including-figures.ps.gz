Reference-contexts: Pitch accents Pierrehumbert describes English intonation in terms of high and low tone levels, scaled higher or lower relative to a reference line | an F0 value | for the phrase <ref> [2] </ref>. Six combinations of high and low tones form the pitch accents, denoted by H*, L*, H*+L, H+L*, 33 L*+H and L+H* [21, 20]. They describe F0 changes that occur within an emphasized word, to the syllable bearing primary lexical stress. H* and L* are the simple pitch accents. <p> The reference line is deliberately and intentionally employed to convey meaning. For example, a raised reference line (and possibly an attendant expanded pitch range) signals the start of a new topic. Its movement upwards is correlated with "speaking up" <ref> [2] </ref>. The Speaker A speaker's lowest speaking F0 is called the baseline in Generative Intonation. It is physically constrained by the speaker's vocal apparatus (for example, by vocal fold mass or larynx size [3]). <p> A speaker's pitch range is bounded by the baseline, which is fixed, and a topline, which varies. The topline is the highest F0 in the utterance. It increases with sentence length [26], with the introduction of a new topic, perhaps, with a raised reference line <ref> [2] </ref> as well as with speaker agitation. A speaker's highest pitch (a shriek) is rarely reached. However, the baseline pitch is often reached as proximity to the baseline is the measure of final lowering and, therefore, the finality of the statement. <p> Physiology determines average pitch while paralinguistic and linguistic considerations determine the reference line. However, they might possibly describe the same phenomenon. Raising the average pitch to indicate speaker arousal seems analogous to raising the reference line for "speaking up" <ref> [2] </ref>. Yet, for a sentence with only H* accents, most F0 values are above the reference line, yielding an average pitch that is distinct from and higher than the reference line.

Reference-contexts: Articulation tended to be imprecise, especially for consonants in unstressed syllables. These results are summarized in Table 2.2. The acoustical correlates induced primarily by physiological changes appear consistent across languages. Subjects listening to passages in unknown languages (Kretsch [6], Beier and Zautra, 1972 <ref> [4] </ref>) recognized emotions with accuracy significantly above chance. This was particularly true for longer passages [4]. <p> These results are summarized in Table 2.2. The acoustical correlates induced primarily by physiological changes appear consistent across languages. Subjects listening to passages in unknown languages (Kretsch [6], Beier and Zautra, 1972 <ref> [4] </ref>) recognized emotions with accuracy significantly above chance. This was particularly true for longer passages [4]. <p> the same vein, Apple and Hecht (1982) found that emotions differing in the amount of subjectively perceived energy (i.e., activity) levels, such as anger and boredom, were correctly identified in speech significantly more often than those, such as sadness and satisfaction, differing mainly in degree of perceived pleasantness (i.e., evaluation) <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.2.3 Prosodic correlates of emotion In this section we turn to the hearer's perception of speech. Pitch, rhythm and intensity are the perceptual components of speech prosody affected by changes in the speaker's emotional state. <p> Pauses are short and occur infrequently. Conversely, depression slows speech and introduces longer and more frequent hesitation pauses. Pleasant emotions, such as affection, cause regular rhythm, while those judged unpleasant exhibit more irregularity, as with sadness <ref> [4] </ref>. Extreme speaker agitation may cause speech errors | hesitations, repetitions, corrections, omissions | and increases the proportion of nonlinguistic to linguistic sounds [24]. 2.2.4 Lexical correlates of emotion Emotional states may have grammatical and lexical correlates as well. <p> Busemann (1925, 1926) conducted some of the earliest investigations in this area. He used as a measure the verb/adjective ratio, which increases with increasing anxiety <ref> [4] </ref>. Osgood (1960) noted that with greater speaker arousal there is an increase in the noun-verb/adjective-adverb ratio [4]. Wiener and Mehrabian (1968) correlated verbal immediacy with the speaker's aversion or affinity to the listener, the topic or the pragmatics. <p> Busemann (1925, 1926) conducted some of the earliest investigations in this area.

Osgood (1960) noted that with greater speaker arousal there is an increase in the noun-verb/adjective-adverb ratio [4]. Wiener and Mehrabian (1968) correlated verbal immediacy with the speaker's aversion or affinity to the listener, the topic or the pragmatics. The greater the aversion, the more frequent the constructions signifying temporal or spatial distance. <p> The greater the aversion, the more frequent the constructions signifying temporal or spatial distance. For example, the present tense conveys greater temporal immediacy than the present perfect, while the deictics "this" 29 and "these" convey greater spatial immediacy than "that" and "those" <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.3 Measurement of the Speech Correlates of Emotion This section describes in more detail the speech correlates of emotion that are measurable features of the speech signal. The features are those of the F0 contour, duration, phoneme articulation and voice quality. <p> Relative durations are also a function of individual speaking style. Notable pause features are frequency of occurrence, average duration and location within a clause. An agitated speaker will tend to speak quickly with fewer and shorter pauses <ref> [4] </ref>, while a depressed speaker will speak slowly. Hesitation pauses, which interrupt syntactic units, may reflect a disruption of cognitive functioning. Taken together, the pause features reveal the extent and type of cognitive or systemic disturbance. <p> In cases where the descriptions conflicted, the conflicts were re 116 solved in favor of the feature value that sounded the most authentic. The descriptions are summarized below: Angry speech was characterized by large F0 transitions, a generally downward inflection [9], irregular rhythm, irregular inflection <ref> [4] </ref>, rising pitch contours, sharp attacks, quick rises in intensity [23], precise enunciation [4], strong high frequency energy [4], and speech that is loud, high-pitched and quick [25]. <p> The descriptions are summarized below: Angry speech was characterized by large F0 transitions, a generally downward inflection [9], irregular rhythm, irregular inflection <ref> [4] </ref>, rising pitch contours, sharp attacks, quick rises in intensity [23], precise enunciation [4], strong high frequency energy [4], and speech that is loud, high-pitched and quick [25]. In disgusted speech, Fairbanks and Pronovost observed low pitch, a wide pitch range, extreme variations in inflection, and a slow speech rate (comparable to sadness) [9]. <p> The descriptions are summarized below: Angry speech was characterized by large F0 transitions, a generally downward inflection [9], irregular rhythm, irregular inflection <ref> [4] </ref>, rising pitch contours, sharp attacks, quick rises in intensity [23], precise enunciation [4], strong high frequency energy [4], and speech that is loud, high-pitched and quick [25]. In disgusted speech, Fairbanks and Pronovost observed low pitch, a wide pitch range, extreme variations in inflection, and a slow speech rate (comparable to sadness) [9]. In contrast, description, Scherer noted only moderate pitch variation in disgusted speech [23]. <p> Glad speech was characterized by regular rhythm and inflection [6]; a steady upward inflection <ref> [4] </ref>, a wide pitch range and extreme variations in pitch [23].

Reference-contexts: The DECtalk recognizes six symbols for effecting lexical stress: * "'" for primary stress * "`" for secondary stress * """ for emphatic primary stress * "n" for pitch fall * "/" for pitch rise * "/n " for pitch rise and fall <ref> [5] </ref>. Pitch accents apply only to the stressed syllable of a pitch accented word. Any of the primary stress markings should do the same. Or at least, the influence of a word stress marking should only affect the contour for duration of the word. <p> The DECtalk's default intonation, and the means for changing it, are described below. DECtalk intonation is based upon an F0 contour shape called a "hat rise" <ref> [5] </ref>. This describes the tendency for F0 to rise on the first stressed syllable and remain high until the end of the utterance, when there is either a dramatic fall or a fall-rise pattern [13]. <p> The closest approximation is the hat rise setting. Hat rise describes an F0 contour that is shaped like a hat. It starts low, rises, is relatively flat throughout most of the utterance, and then returns to a low pitch at the end <ref> [5] </ref> (see Figure 5.10). Raising the hat rise value has the advantage over average pitch of not changing speaker identity quite as drastically. 93 [']thought you [']really [']meant it." with hat rise values of (a) 0 (b) 18 (normal) (c) 50 (d) 100. <p> Pauses The implementation of fluent and hesitation pauses are discussed together. Pause discontinuity, an Affect Editor voice quality parameter, is also briefly discussed. The DECtalk's own rules insert pauses before a verb phrase, after a comma, after a period and after a paragraph <ref> [5] </ref>. A slight pause is automatically inserted by the DECtalk before a verb phrase. Neither the comma or period are useful for fluent or hesitation pause markers because they affect intonation as well as duration.

Reference-contexts: Articulation tended to be imprecise, especially for consonants in unstressed syllables. These results are summarized in Table 2.2. The acoustical correlates induced primarily by physiological changes appear consistent across languages. Subjects listening to passages in unknown languages (Kretsch <ref> [6] </ref>, Beier and Zautra, 1972 [4]) recognized emotions with accuracy significantly above chance. This was particularly true for longer passages [4]. <p> Davitz (1964) observed that intensity (loudness), speech rate, median pitch, timbre and precision of articulation distinguished emotional states and additionally, varied together along the activity dimension <ref> [6] </ref>. Furthermore, he found that dissimilar emotions with similar activity ratings, such as anger and joy, were often mistaken for each other. <p> Anger, fear and joy all had high ratings along the activity dimension of this space; despair has a particularly low activity rating <ref> [6] </ref>. For emotions, these ratings appeared to correspond to the magnitude of systemic arousal or inhibition characteristic of the emotion. 6 When a word is stressed by perturbations of the F0 contour, these perturbations will be concentrated in the syllable carrying primary stress [20]. 28 be smooth or discontinuous [29]. <p> Davitz and Scherer observed separately that changes along the activity and evaluation dimensions appeared to correspond to changes in speech phenomena, particularly those linked to physiology. Thus, intensity, pitch, timbre, speech rate and precision of articulation tended to vary with changes along the activity dimension <ref> [6] </ref>, while prosodic phenomena | regularity of changes, rhythm, inflection | tended to vary with changes in evaluation [25, 23]. Although this tripartite representation has been useful in psychoacoustical research, its dimensions are not specific to speech. It is appropriate to a higher level representation of emotion. <p> It predicted that the difficulty of distinguishing among synthesized affects would parallel that observed for affect identification in human speech. These difficulties arise for emotions with dissimilar semantics but similar acoustical features, such as anger and joy <ref> [6] </ref>, 115 or between emotions that have similar semantic interpretations, such as anger and disgust. <p> It had a wide pitch range, few pauses [9] and was loud, quick Rising rising pitch contours, [25], sharp attacks, quick rises in intensity and concentrations of energy in the upper ranges of the spectrum [23] were also observed.

It was loud, high-pitched, blaring, fast and with precise enunciation [4]. Sad speech was slow, with minimal variability among its features [8] and many pauses, (especially between phrases [8]).

Reference-contexts: Pauses fall into two categories. Fluent or juncture pauses normally occur between intonational (hence, semantic and syntactic) clauses. Hesitation pauses occur not at clause junctures but within clauses, typically after a function word or the first word in the clause <ref> [7] </ref>. Their introduction may coincide with an increase in intensity of cognitive processing [18]. They may be filled with drawn-out words, or non-lexical sounds such as "um" and "uh", or unfilled (silent). <p> Phrases A sequence of pitch accents followed by a phrase accent 7 is the minimal grouping in Generative Intonation. It defines an intermediate phrase, alternatively referred to as a "breath group" [28] or a "phonemic clause" <ref> [7] </ref>. A sequence of intermediate phrases followed by a boundary tone | the final pitch for the phrase | constitutes an intonational phrase. Pitch range has scope over intermediate and intonational phrases. <p> In the Affect Editor, the smallest intonational clause that can be preceded by a fluent pause is the intermediate phrase. Hesitation pauses occur within an intonational clause interrupting its semantic coherency. Dittmann locates them following the first function word in a clause <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> Speech rate is measured in words or syllables per minute. Its components include how quickly and individual word or syllable is uttered, the duration 5 Dittmann calls these intonational groupings phonemic clauses <ref> [7] </ref>. 46 of sound to silence within an utterance and the relative durations of phoneme classes. Stress frequency quantifies the frequency of word stress occurrence (pitch accents). The more agitated the speaker, the more emphatic the speech and the more frequently words are stressed. <p> The ranking of hesitation pauses is also intended to represent the relative difficulty of formulating the concept they precede. Dittmann <ref> [7] </ref> observed that most hesitation pauses follow the first function word in an intonational phrase.

Reference-contexts: The filtering action of the vocal tract results in loss or amplification of harmonics. Local effects are concentrated in phoneme attributes | vowel duration, completeness of closure for obstruents and the overall degree of enunciation. 2.2.2 Acoustical correlates of emotion Fairbanks and Pronovost (1939) <ref> [9] </ref> had actors simulated five emotions | anger, fear, indifference, grief and contempt | in order to study their effect on F0. <p> In cases where the descriptions conflicted, the conflicts were re 116 solved in favor of the feature value that sounded the most authentic.

Reference-contexts: Pitch contour, F0 contour and intonation contour are used interchangeably in this thesis to describe the F0 trajectory over the course of an utterance. Although F0 is the main carrier of linguistic and pragmatic information <ref> [10, 20] </ref>, rhythm (the combination of phonation durations, silence durations and word stress) and perceived intensity (loudness) also contribute 3 . Prosody refers to the control of pitch, duration and intensity to convey non-lexical linguistic and pragmatic information. Prosody makes a discourse more coherent. <p> In this 3 The work of D. B. Fry underscores the importance of intonation to English. He found that word emphasis is accomplished mainly through changes in the F0 contour, secondarily through changes in duration and lastly through changes in intensity <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Large waveform amplitude is perceived as loudness. The more excited the speaker, the greater the subglottal pressure and signal amplitude and the louder the voice. Although people perceive stressed words as being louder they are actually responding to increased pitch <ref> [10] </ref>. The loudness of speech is much more a result of speaker physiology than consciously applied prosody. Thus, loudness primarily conveys affective and not linguistic information. Pause discontinuity describes the smoothness of the transitions from sound to silence for unfilled pauses.

Reference-contexts: Used to end a yes-no question, this same contour implies that the speaker expects a positive response [12]. H% tones may signal the speaker's intent to continue, as in the continuation rise, L H%, and also establish satisfaction-precedence relationships <ref> [11] </ref> within a sequence of statements. L% tones, especially in L L% phrase endings, convey finality and completion [12]. 2.5 Summary Acoustic, linguistic and cognitive inquiries have shown that vocalization is influenced by emotion | the cognitive and physiological responses of an organism to its environment. <p> However, to complete the description, and to add the generative component, the mental correlates of emotion must be modeled as well. Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg have shown how intonation reveals the attentional 1 and intentional 2 structure of discourse [22] as described by Grosz and Sidner <ref> [11] </ref>. The integration of emotion into this analysis rests with the intentional component of discourse. Emotion, as a mental state (albeit one with physiological components) is comprised of beliefs, intentions and plans. Affect is employed to convey information about these components. <p> It is communicated over the course of several utterances. A collection of utterances devoted to the satisfaction of one intention comprises a discourse segment. Discourses are divided into segments, each defined by a distinct an intention or purpose, which explains why the segment was initiated in the first place <ref> [11] </ref>. 137 At the extremes of emotion this definition is strained because intentions are normally under-stood to be intentional, in other words, under the control of the person who has them.

Reference-contexts: Pierrehumbert's dissertation [20] describes a grammar of English intonation, a major step towards the systematic generation of correct and meaningful intonation. Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's recent account of the semantics of intonation opens the possibility of generating by rule intonation appropriate to the propositional and pragmatic function of the utterance <ref> [12] </ref>. 2.4.1 Components of the theory The importance of Generative Intonation is that it replaces a literal pitch contour description, in terms of points on a frequency/time axis, with a symbolic one described by combinations of high (H) and low (L) tones. <p> In general, L+H tones invoke a sense of scale upon which the emphasized item should be placed, while H+L tones invoke an inference path supporting a predication <ref> [12] </ref>. Terminal contour semantics The phrase accents and boundary tones in the terminal contour express the relation of a phrase to other phrases in the discourse. <p> Similarly, an H% boundary tone signals interpretation of the current intonational phrase with respect to succeeding utterances, while an L% boundary tone signals interpretation with respect to previous utterances <ref> [12] </ref>. The combination of nuclear pitch accent, phrase accent and boundary tone describes fully the terminal contour. For example, an L* L H% contour has a steep rise at the end. <p> The high-rise contour, H* H H%, when part of a statement, conveys doubt about the relevance of the new information (emphasized with an H*) being added to the mutual belief space. Used to end a yes-no question, this same contour implies that the speaker expects a positive response <ref> [12] </ref>. H% tones may signal the speaker's intent to continue, as in the continuation rise, L H%, and also establish satisfaction-precedence relationships [11] within a sequence of statements. L% tones, especially in L L% phrase endings, convey finality and completion [12]. 2.5 Summary Acoustic, linguistic and cognitive inquiries have shown that <p> same contour implies that the speaker expects a positive response <ref> [12] </ref>. H% tones may signal the speaker's intent to continue, as in the continuation rise, L H%, and also establish satisfaction-precedence relationships [11] within a sequence of statements. L% tones, especially in L L% phrase endings, convey finality and completion [12]. 2.5 Summary Acoustic, linguistic and cognitive inquiries have shown that vocalization is influenced by emotion | the cognitive and physiological responses of an organism to its environment.

Reference-contexts: DECtalk intonation is based upon an F0 contour shape called a "hat rise" [5]. This describes the tendency for F0 to rise on the first stressed syllable and remain high until the end of the utterance, when there is either a dramatic fall or a fall-rise pattern <ref> [13] </ref>. The default dramatic fall at the end is modified if the DECtalk's assertiveness value is low, or if the final punctuation is "!" or "?" in which case alternate terminal contours are applied. Word stress (pitch accents) takes the form of a local rise above the hat-shaped intonation pattern [13]. <p> <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, the construction of a functional vocal tract model synthesizer is not yet feasible. Not enough is known about what is intrinsic and necessary, and the computational costs of incorporating what is known are currently too high <ref> [14] </ref>. 42 discourse events. Its descriptors describe only speech events. Secondly, because the percep-tual parameters are explicitly declared, this model is well suited for testing the perceptual effects of affect in speech. Finally, current technology supports such a model. <p> Pitch accents There is no direct DECtalk translation for the Generative Intonation pitch accents. The stresses recognized by Klattalk, and therefore by the DECtalk, are always excursions upwards from the original hat rise contour <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Fluent or juncture pauses normally occur between intonational (hence, semantic and syntactic) clauses. Hesitation pauses occur not at clause junctures but within clauses, typically after a function word or the first word in the clause [7]. Their introduction may coincide with an increase in intensity of cognitive processing <ref> [18] </ref>. They may be filled with drawn-out words, or non-lexical sounds such as "um" and "uh", or unfilled (silent). As the speaker's agitation increases, average syllable duration decreases and the speech rate, measured in syllables per second or words per minute, increases. Pauses are short and occur infrequently.

Reference-contexts: Pitch contour, F0 contour and intonation contour are used interchangeably in this thesis to describe the F0 trajectory over the course of an utterance. Although F0 is the main carrier of linguistic and pragmatic information <ref> [10, 20] </ref>, rhythm (the combination of phonation durations, silence durations and word stress) and perceived intensity (loudness) also contribute 3 . Prosody refers to the control of pitch, duration and intensity to convey non-lexical linguistic and pragmatic information. Prosody makes a discourse more coherent. <p> The emotional state combines with the role of the utterance in the discourse to impart characteristic slopes to the F0 contour up to the nuclear syllable (the last syllable to contain a pitch accent <ref> [20] </ref>) and to the terminal contour (the part of the phrase bounded by the last accented word and the sentence offset). <p> For emotions, these ratings appeared to correspond to the magnitude of systemic arousal or inhibition characteristic of the emotion. 6 When a word is stressed by perturbations of the F0 contour, these perturbations will be concentrated in the syllable carrying primary stress <ref> [20] </ref>. 28 be smooth or discontinuous [29].

Reference-contexts: In particular, catathesis or downstepping, the systematically decreasing F0 in list contours, is explained without the use of prominence <ref> [22] </ref>. It is triggered by the presence of a bitonal accent which compresses 35 the pitch range for the words that follow, and thereby reduces the height of subsequent pitch accents. A contour displaying catathesis can be calculated from the pitch range, accent types and accent positions. <p> They describe speed (speech rate), syncopation (exaggeration, stress frequency) and location of silences (fluent pauses, hesitation 4 Pierrehumbert defines "speaker baseline" as the lowest F0 produced for all utterances <ref> [22] </ref>.

They are usually under conscious control, since, like pitch effects, they are used to consciously convey meaning. However, physiological occurrences may induce extremes of timing effects. <p> The physiological and acoustical correlates of emotion have been well-defined. However, to complete the description, and to add the generative component, the mental correlates of emotion must be modeled as well. Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg have shown how intonation reveals the attentional 1 and intentional 2 structure of discourse <ref> [22] </ref> as described by Grosz and Sidner [11]. The integration of emotion into this analysis rests with the intentional component of discourse. Emotion, as a mental state (albeit one with physiological components) is comprised of beliefs, intentions and plans. Affect is employed to convey information about these components.

Reference-contexts: Pleasant emotions, such as affection, cause regular rhythm, while those judged unpleasant exhibit more irregularity, as with sadness [4]. Extreme speaker agitation may cause speech errors | hesitations, repetitions, corrections, omissions | and increases the proportion of nonlinguistic to linguistic sounds <ref> [24] </ref>. 2.2.4 Lexical correlates of emotion Emotional states may have grammatical and lexical correlates as well. Busemann (1925, 1926) conducted some of the earliest investigations in this area. He used as a measure the verb/adjective ratio, which increases with increasing anxiety [4].

Reference-contexts: Strong arousal of the sympathetic nervous system occurs for anger or fear and affects the organism by inducing: 21 * increased heart rate and blood pressure * changes in the depth and pattern of respiratory movements * an increase in the respiration rate, causing greater subglottal pressure <ref> [28] </ref> * drying of the mouth * occasional muscle tremor. <p> * greater speed and loudness * more energy in the higher frequencies relative to that in lower frequencies * an expanded F0 range * from increased subglottal pressure, a median F0 value that is higher than for normal speech * disturbed rhythm, presumably from shorter durations of speech between breaths <ref> [28] </ref> * increased fluctuations in the F0 contour * increased precision of articulation (enunciation)[29]. Inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, and thereby, arousal of the parasympathetic nervous system, occurs for states such as relaxation or grief. <p> pitches variability, vibrato Table 2.1: Summary of Fairbanks and Hoaglin's comparison of the speech correlates of anger, contempt, fear, grief, and indifference. frequency | its median value, the average pitch range, the characteristic shape of the contour, the rate of F0 change along the contour | and the speech rate <ref> [28] </ref>. They observed that utterances spoken in anger exhibited the highest median F0, the widest F0 range, and the most rapid F0 changes. Despite the rapidity of F0 changes, the overall contour was relatively smooth. One or two syllables in the phrase showed greater F0 peaks, suggesting greater emphasis. <p> Fortunately, they are also amenable to control with current synthesizer technology. 2.3.1 The F0 contour Attributes of the F0 contour | the median F0 value, the F0 range and F0 variations | appear to be the main carriers of affective information <ref> [28] </ref>. The median F0 value is the average of the F0 values over the course of an utterance. It conveys the speaker's level of excitation (high median F0) or inhibition (low median F0) as it relates to the speaker's currently recognized F0 range. <p> Relative durations of vowels and consonantal closures contribute to speech rate. Williams and Stevens noted that increased durations for utterances made in anger, fear and sorrow came both from increased vowel durations and lengthened intervals of closure or constriction for consonants <ref> [28] </ref>. Relative durations are also a function of individual speaking style. Notable pause features are frequency of occurrence, average duration and location within a clause. An agitated speaker will tend to speak quickly with fewer and shorter pauses [4], while a depressed speaker will speak slowly. <p> Precise articulation is perceived as enunciated speech; imprecise articulation is perceived as slurred. Generally, precision increases with speech rate. 31 Intensity of release for stop consonants is a feature of consonantal articulation. It increases with the greater subglottal pressure and more complete consonantal closures that accompany increased speaker agitation <ref> [28] </ref>. 2.3.4 Voice quality Voice quality is described by characteristics that can be measured at most points in the speech signal. Intensity, voicing irregularities, the ratio of high to low frequency energy, breathiness and laryngealization contribute to perceptions of voice quality. <p> Voicing irregularities cover a wide range of voicing characteristics. Vocal jitter refers to fluctuations from one glottal pulse to the next, as in anger. The cessation of voicing is seen in emotions such as sorrow, where speech becomes simply a whisper <ref> [28] </ref>. The ratio of high and low frequency energy changes with speaker agitation. Great high frequency energy correlates with agitation; minimal high frequency energy correlates with depression or calm. Thus, there is greatest energy in the higher frequencies for anger, and least for sorrow [28]. <p> where speech becomes simply a whisper <ref> [28] </ref>. The ratio of high and low frequency energy changes with speaker agitation. Great high frequency energy correlates with agitation; minimal high frequency energy correlates with depression or calm. Thus, there is greatest energy in the higher frequencies for anger, and least for sorrow [28]. Breathiness and laryngealization reflect characteristic individual vocal tract "settings" and so are predominantly correlated with speaker identity rather than affect [16]. Their correlation with affect is barely mentioned in the literature. <p> Tones not followed by asterisks are "leading" or "trailing" tones and are of generally shorter duration [20]. Phrases A sequence of pitch accents followed by a phrase accent 7 is the minimal grouping in Generative Intonation. It defines an intermediate phrase, alternatively referred to as a "breath group" <ref> [28] </ref> or a "phonemic clause" [7]. A sequence of intermediate phrases followed by a boundary tone | the final pitch for the phrase | constitutes an intonational phrase. Pitch range has scope over intermediate and intonational phrases. <p> A high accent shape value indicates maximum agitation, visible as a steep rise and fall in the F0 contour with a high F0 at the peak. Thus, the large and high F0 excursions for anger, noted by Williams and Stevens <ref> [28] </ref>, can be specified with a high accent shape value. Perceptually, the value for accent shape corresponds to how noticeable each accent is. <p> Timing effects are primarily products of cognitive processes or linguistic neces-sity. They are usually under conscious control, since, like pitch effects, they are used to consciously convey meaning. However, physiological occurrences may induce extremes of timing effects. For example, an increased respiration rate creates shorter units of speech <ref> [28] </ref> and, thereby, changes speech rhythm. Timing effects are described by exaggeration, fluent pauses, hesitation pauses, speech rate and stress frequency. Exaggeration affects rhythm and represents the extent to which the speech rate slows for stressed words. <p> With less motor control, F0 transitions are abrupt and quickly fluctuating. With more control, F0 transitions are smoother. Tremor, also called jitter, describes voicing irregularities that occur between successive waveforms. It has been observed in the expression of fear <ref> [28] </ref>. 3.2.4 Articulation Articulation effects are currently described only by their precision. Precision of articulation covers a range of articulation styles from slurring to enunciation. An imprecisely enunciated (slurred) consonant has minimal frication noise, and, if originally unvoiced, may be realized as voiced. <p> Each field contains a string composed of one or more phonemes, and occasionally, their durations. Tremor Tremors are sometimes observed for utterances spoken in fear <ref> [28] </ref>. However, there is no means to directly implement or even approximate tremor with the DECtalk, so it remains unimplemented. Articulation Precision of articulation is the Affect Editor's only articulation parameter.
