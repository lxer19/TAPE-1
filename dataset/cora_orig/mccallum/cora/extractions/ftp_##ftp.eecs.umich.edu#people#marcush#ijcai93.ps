Abstract: Plan recognition is the process of observing another agent's behavior(s) and inferring what, and possibly why, the agent is acting as it is. Plan recognition becomes a very important means of acquiring such information about other agents in situations and domains where explicit communication is either very costly, dangerous, or impossible. Performing plan recognition in a physical domain (i.e. the real world) forces the world's ubiquitous uncertainty upon the observing agent because of the necessity to use real sensors to make the observations. We have developed a multiple resolution, hierarchical plan recognition system to coordinate the motion of two interacting mobile robots. Uncertainty arises in the system from dead reckoning errors that accumulate while the robots are moving, as well as by errors in the computer vision system that is used to detect the other agent's behaviors. Based upon belief networks, the plan recognition system gracefully degrades in performance as the level of uncertainty about observations increase.

Reference-contexts: As the accumulation of dead reckoning errors grow, however, the ambiguity of the motion increases, and the observations become more uncertain. 7 CARMEL: The Implemented System We have implemented our system on CARMEL, a Cybermotion K2A mobile robot used previously in research on obstacle avoidance <ref> [1] </ref> and autonomous robotics [6]. CARMEL serves as the observer, performing plan recognition based on observations of other agents in its environment with which it may interact.

Reference-contexts: representation did not have to go to such a high level of detail since the robot was quite far from any of the possible destinations. 5 Plan Recognition Architecture Our plan recognition system is based upon belief networks, a graph-oriented probabilistic representation of causal and dependency relationships between concepts (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a gentle introduction). Belief networks allow us to model actions (observable activities of an agent), plans, and goals, and the relationships between them. The belief network that we have started with is shown in Figure 1 (b).

Reference-contexts: Because of this, we see plan recognition as being a very important mechanism by which agents can acquire the information that they need in order to coordinate their activities with other agents. Plan recognition research to date, however, has been primarily conducted in such domains as story understanding <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, intelligent interfaces [9, 14], and discourse analysis [12, 13]. These domains lack an essential element of physical domains, however, namely observational uncertainty.

The system, being committed to assuming observations are correct and exact, occasionally miscalculates the location, and therefore the motion.
