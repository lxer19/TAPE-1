Abstract: This report documents a framework called Parino that we have developed for solving large mixed integer programs (MIPs) in parallel. Parino combines portability and efficiency with flexibility. It is written in C ++ , and is portable across any message passing platforms. The flexibility of the framework is a result of mapping the MIP computation to an entity-FSM paradigm, where it is expressed in terms of the interactions among several distributed active objects. Thus, it is possible to incrementally enhance the functionality of Parino by incorporating new dynamic objects into the framework. We have used this feature to augment the core parallel MIP computation in Parino with a simple distributed cut management system, which is again expressed in terms of the entity-FSM paradigm. Parino is currently operational. It has been tested on an 8-node IBM SP2 multicomputer, and new feature additions and enhancements are being continually made to it.

Reference-contexts: computation by varying the various key parameters at runtime, thereby varying the strategies of computation and search and the appropriate use of various heuristics. 2 Entity-FSM Architecture To facilitate extendability and portability without sacrificing efficiency, the Parino system is built using an efficient and portable class library called Naylak (see <ref> [9] </ref> for an overview). The Naylak system supports a world view based on the concept of active entities for distributed computation. It provides a higher software interface layer above traditional process-based message passing systems. Figure 1 illustrates the Naylak system architecture.
