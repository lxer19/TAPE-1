Abstract: Whereas the Web has been growing at a rapid rate to become a global information source, Workflow management systems (WFMSs) are gaining popularity as a tool to automate business processes. The number of companies adopting the Web as a platform for conducting their daily business activities and for electronic commerce is expected to sharply increase. Hence, there is a need for developing WFMSs that address the requirements of conducting business over the Web and making efficient use of Web technology. In this paper, we discuss how the technology developed for workflows can be applied to meet the needs of electronic commerce applications over the Web. We also show how the same technology can be used to build virtual warehouses from information sources available on the Web. As an example of this we show how the various types of information needed for intelligent decision making by an investor in stocks can be automatically gathered and presented to a user using workflow techniques.

Reference-contexts: In the rest of the paper, after introducing workflows, we discuss how this can be accomplished. 2 Workflow Management Systems As described by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) <ref> [Hol94] </ref>, a WFMS consists mainly of a workflow engine and some application agents. In addition, there are other components for modeling, administration and monitoring. The workflow engine and the tools communicate with a workflow database to store and update workflow relevant data.

Reference-contexts: Essentially the workflow engine becomes a client of the Web servers. Figure 2 portrays the equivalent components of a WFMS on the Web. 4 Ingredients of Efficient Solutions Executing workflows over the web necessitates development of solutions to the following problems <ref> [KR97] </ref>: 1. Unreliability of the Web network failure/delay, server overloading 2. Heterogeneity of data available from different Web servers 3. Ensuring workflow progress and trackability in spite of distributed execution of workflows.

Workshop on High Performance Transaction Systems (HPTS), </booktitle> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: Consider a large sequence of steps, each to be performed at a different external Web server. After the completion of each step, the status is recorded in the workflow database and this simplifies tracking. To deal with data heterogeneity, we need a facility for plug-in syntactic translators <ref> [KRGL97] </ref>. Also, we need protocols to ensure that an update request is processed by a server exactly once, despite network/server failures [KRGL97]. This will facilitate the reliable execution of workflows on the Web. <p> To deal with data heterogeneity, we need a facility for plug-in syntactic translators <ref> [KRGL97] </ref>.

Such a system enables business-to-business transactions across enterprises and permits round the clock order processing. Furthermore, using the facilities provided in <ref> [KRGL97] </ref>, we can achieve reliable (handling failures and contingencies) and responsive (reduced latency) processing of the orders. 6 Conclusion and Related Work Although commercial efforts for integrating web technology with workflow technology have mainly focused on using the Web as an interface to WFMSs, to take full advantage of the web's

Reference-contexts: Now, we discuss how a WFMS for the Web differs from a traditional WFMS. The Web is essentially a client-server based distributed system where browsers acting as clients communicate with Web servers using the HTTP protocol <ref> [HTT] </ref>. When a workflow is executed on the Web, the Web servers play the role of agents. The CGI-scripts at the Web servers are the programs executed for performing an automated step. Many of these scripts execute transactions against a backend database.

Our work also differs from the numerous recent research efforts to query information from multiple data sources on the web <ref> [ACHK94, LRO96] </ref>. Their aim is to determine which sites to get the information from and how to process the obtained information to satisfy a given query. <p> Executing them reliably over the unreliable Web is an important requirement. However, some of the data modeling techniques developed for querying can be enhanced for automatically constructing workflow schemas. For example, sophisticated data modeling and search mechanisms like the ones developed for the Information Manifold <ref> [LRO96] </ref> might be used to construct a workflow schema that consists only of automatic steps and performs data mapping from the output of one step to the input of another using the built-in knowledge (ontology).

Reference-contexts: The Web interfaces access data from backend DBMSs using a CGI script or some other method (e:g:; the direct interface between HTML and SQL described in <ref> [NS96] </ref>). Each step in a workflow accesses data from at most one Web server. 5 Applications of World Wide Workflows In this section, we first show how workflows can be used to build virtual warehouses.
