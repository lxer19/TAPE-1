Title: An Implemented Formalism for Computing Linguistic Presuppositions and Existential Commitments  
Author: Daniel Marcu and Graeme Hirst

Abstract: We rely on the strength of linguistic and philosophical perspectives in constructing a framework that offers a unified explanation for presuppositions and existential commitment. We use a rich ontology and a set of methodological principles that embed the essence of Meinong's philosophy and Grice's conversational principles into a stratified logic, under an unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers. The result is a logical formalism that yields a tractable computational method that uniformly calculates all the presuppositions of a given utterance, including the existential ones.

Reference-contexts: Theories of linguistic presupposition and their relation to (non)existence The vast majority of the linguistic approaches are more concerned with "how presuppositions are inherited" than with "what presuppositions are". Presuppositions are defined in terms of plugs, holes, and filters [ Karttunen, 1973 ] , consistency <ref> [ Gazdar, 1979 ] </ref> , uncontrover-siality [ Soames, 1982 ] , or hypothetical and secondary contexts [ Kay, 1992 ] , but nothing is said about the logical framework into which they may be expressed.

Reference-contexts: However, day-to-day English provides an impressive number of cases when existential presuppositions are not inferred, or when they are defeated by some commonsense knowledge (see <ref> [ Hirst, 1991 ] </ref> for a comprehensive study).

Reference-contexts: principles that unify Meinong's [ 1904 ] philosophy with Grice's [ 1975 ] conversational principles; * a rich ontology in the style of Hirst [ 1991 ] , which provides the possibility of having consistent models that contain objects belonging to different ontological spaces; * an extension of stratified logic <ref> [ Marcu, 1994 ] </ref> where the quantifiers are read under Lejewski's [ 1954 ] "unrestricted interpretation", which provides us the formal tool for expressing the above layers. The implementation relies on an extension of the Beth semantic tableaux to stratified logic. <p> Therefore, sentences such as Sherlock Holmes is smarter than any other detective or The strike was averted cannot be represented in their theories. 3. Reasoning in stratified logic Stratified logic <ref> [ Marcu, 1994 ] </ref> reflects a different understanding of default reasoning phenomena from that found in the classic literature [ Re-iter, 1980 ] . Instead of treating the notion of de-feasibility on consistency and justification-based grounds, we conjecture that defeasible inferences are "weaker" than classical entailments.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, first-order logic is doomed to fail in any attempt to reflect the presuppositions of definite references. Several approaches to nonexistence rely on Meinong's mental act philosophy <ref> [ Meinong, 1904 ] </ref> . For example, Parsons [ 1980 ] avoids Rus-sell's paraphrase of the definite description by using the predicate E!. For Parsons, (x) refers to the unique object that satisfies if there is such an object. Otherwise, it does not refer to anything at all.
