Abstract: Imposing structure on the Smith form of an (integer) periodicity matrix N = UflV leads to efficient m-D DFT implementations. For resampling matrices, i.e. non-singular rational matrices, we introduce Smith form decomposition algorithms to generate fl matrices whose diagonal elements exhibit minimum variance and U matrices with minimum norm. Such structure simplifies non-uniform m-D filter bank design.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In m-D signal processing, a sampling matrix describes the uniform sampling of m-D data because its column vectors form the basis vectors of the sampling grid <ref> [1] </ref>. Once discretized, the sampled m-D data may be resampled onto a different sampling grid. Resampling the sampled signal in the analog domain requires a conversion of the data to analog form and a resampling with a different scheme (which may possibly require additional hardware). <p> Since a rational matrix can be written as a rational number times an integer matrix, resampling matrices include integer non-singular matrices such as periodicity matrices <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and up/downsampling matrices [2, 3]. When the resampling matrix is diagonal, the resampling grid is rectangular and the resampling operation is separable. In general, however, resampling matrices are not diagonal, and a transformation is required to decouple the m-D dependencies.

One common transformation is known as the Smith form decomposition <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5] </ref>. The Smith form decomposes a resampling matrix S into a product of three "simpler" resampling matrices U fl V , and each component matrix has the same dimensions as S (e.g., 2 fi 2 for 2-D resampling). <p> The resulting integer matrix is then decomposed into its Smith form. Each diagonal element of the fl matrix is divided by d to produce the Smith-McMillan form (the m-D analog of rational sampling rate changers) <ref> [2] </ref>. Even though fl becomes a non-singular rational matrix, U and V remain square regular unimodular integer matrices. Smith forms S = U flV are, however, not unique.

Reference-contexts: Thus, downsampling by S can be decomposed into a shu*ing of input samples by U , followed by a separable down-sampling by fl, and followed by reshu*ing of samples by V [4]. One method for designing m-D non-uniform filter banks <ref> [6] </ref> first decomposes the resampling matrix R associated with each channel into Smith Form U R fl R V R . Then, by cascading the analysis/synthesis sections, the down/upsampling associated with V R cancels. <p> The algorithm takes advantage of the two degrees of freedom in each matrix transformation to minimize U with respect to a given norm measure. The final form imposes structure on the Smith form decomposition to simplify the design of non-uniform m-D filter banks <ref> [6] </ref>. A preliminary version of these algorithms is available for the Mathematica computer algebra environment [10] as the standalone package LatticeTheory.m on the FTP site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu (IP #130.207.226.24) in the directory pub/Mathematica.

Reference-contexts: More formally, we want to design U R such that its lower and upper frame bounds, F min and F max respectively, are as close to 1 as possible, where F min and F max are defined as the minimum and maximum, respectively, of the set <ref> [7] </ref> f kU R f k : kfk = 1 g This paper introduces a new algorithm to decompose a resampling matrix into a Smith form that meets the above requirements, which we will call the minimized Smith equalized form.

Reference-contexts: J. S. Smith in 1861. An algorithm to find it iteratively multiplies the given integer matrix on the left and right by elementary (regular unimodular) matrices until the matrix is reduced to a diagonal form <ref> [8] </ref>. The initial step in the decomposition of an n fi n integer matrix S sets U = I nfin , fl = S, and V = I nfin . <p> The pivoting is then performed at the (2,2) position and so on until fl is diagonalized. The only degree of freedom in this algorithm is the criteria to choose the pivot at each iteration. In <ref> [8] </ref>, the pivot is chosen to be the element that is smallest absolute value. The algorithm above assumed that the matrix to be decomposed contains only integer components. <p> regular unimodular matrix is regular unimodular and the product of two regular uni-modular matrices is regular unimodular, U flV = U X 1 X fl Y Y 1 = U X 1 (XflY ) (1) One application of this equation is to map a Smith form into its canonical form <ref> [8] </ref>. Another important application of this equation is to derive the conditions to pivot factors along the diagonal elements and the matrices to perform the pivoting [5]. The matrix product XflY can move an integer factor i from the lth diagonal entry to the kth diagonal entry [5]. <p> Without loss of generality, det Y = det X = 1: det X = det Y = x ll y ll i + - ^ k ^ l = ff i + fi q = 1 The condition ffi + fiq = 1 is the Bezout identity <ref> [8] </ref> which has a solution if and only if i and q = ^ k ^ l are relatively prime.

Reference-contexts: Euclid's algorithm can compute the solution to the Bezout identity efficiently <ref> [9] </ref>. The Bezout numbers ff and fi are not unique. All solutions to the Bezout identity, ^ff and ^ fi, can be written in terms of an integral parameter t as ^ff = ff + t q and ^ fi = fi t i.
