Reference-contexts: This goal represents a factor of six improvement compared to the E731 result <ref> [2] </ref>: Re (* 0 =*) = (7:4 5:2 2:9) fi 10 4 . During the 1996-1997 KTeV run, we collected a data sample that includes 4 million K L ! 0 0 events after preliminary o*ine cuts.

Reference-contexts: If the CKM matrix is indeed the source of CP violation, the parameter * 0 =*, derived from the double ratio of these decays, is expected to be non-zero. Alternative approaches to the study of direct CP violation have received serious attention over the past decade <ref> [4] </ref>. According to the Standard Model, rare decay modes such as K L ! 0 e + e and K L ! 0 + have direct CP violating amplitudes which are comparable to or larger than their CP conserving and indirect CP violating amplitudes.

Reference-contexts: The KTeV collaboration was formed with the goal of probing the most relevant questions relating to CP violation which are accessible via the neutral kaon system to levels which have not previously been attainable <ref> [8] </ref>. A new physics program to measure the value of * 0 =* with unprecedented precision ( = 1 fi 10 4 ) was approved as E832 in 1992 as the primary goal of the KTeV project.

Reference-contexts: A Letter reporting this result is currently being prepared for submission to the Physical Review. The + e + e + mode is particularly intriguing because it is expected to exhibit a large CP-violating asymmetry in the angular distribution of the final-state particles <ref> [9] </ref>. A preliminary, "express-line" analysis of about half of the E799-II Winter data set already shows strong evidence for an asymmetry similar to the one predicted, based on a sample of a few hundred events. Details of this analysis are described in Section 2.4. <p> This decay opens a new window on CP violation through the study of the final-state angular distributions. A very large asymmetry is expected due to the standard CP violation through mixing. The predicted asymmetry <ref> [9] </ref> in the integrated rate is between 13 and 14%; with the added statistics from the 1999 run the asymmetry could be measured to a precision of 1.2%, implying that we should see a 10- effect.

Reference-contexts: For example, E799-I has already measured the radiative-Dalitz decay K L ! e + e flfl: This decay can mimic the 0 e + e mode, and will undoubtedly provide background in the 0 e + e search region <ref> [10] </ref>. The exact level of this background will not be known for some time, and it can be reduced by making full use of the excellent energy resolution of the CsI calorimeter.

Reference-contexts: But even with this background, E799-II should be able to reduce the 4:3 fi 10 9 90% confidence level upper limit <ref> [11] </ref> on the branching fraction for this mode by approximately an order of magnitude. <p> In addition, various direct CP-violating terms can in principle be present in the amplitude for this decay.

Reference-contexts: The method of analysis and some of the potential difficulties due to backgrounds will be discussed. 2.4.1 K L ! + e + e The rare decay K L ! + e + e has been unambiguously observed <ref> [12] </ref> for the first time in the 1997 KTeV run. A special four-track trigger was designed to collect these events.

Reference-contexts: CP violation detected, the first three being the original discovery of K L decays to two pions, the semileptonic charge asymmetry in K e3 and K 3 decays, and, most recently, the interference between K S and K L decays to + fl observed by E731 and E773 at FNAL <ref> [13] </ref>. KTeV should ultimately provide the best measurement of each of these effects. 2.4.2 K L ! 0 - The best limit on K L ! 0 from E799 will ultimately come from using the Dalitz decay of the 0 .

Reference-contexts: Based upon one observed event in the signal search region, we set a preliminary upper limit on the 0 branching ratio, BR (K L ! 0 -) &lt; 1.6 x 10 6 at the 90% CL <ref> [14] </ref>. This represents a factor of 30 improvement over the best existing limit, obtained by E799-I using the Dalitz decay mode of the 0 [15].

Reference-contexts: This represents a factor of 30 improvement over the best existing limit, obtained by E799-I using the Dalitz decay mode of the 0 <ref> [15] </ref>. It is evident from this analysis that the limiting background for the 0 search with the KTeV detector in 1999 will be beam neutron interactions in the detector. <p> In progress.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in the flavor symmetric quark model, differences between these two decays arise only from the differing particle masses and from the relevant CKM mixing factors (V us rather than V ud ). The predicted branching ratio is 2:61 fi 10 4 . Theoretically interesting flavor symmetry violation <ref> [16] </ref> effects can be readily isolated if they occur in this decay. 3. The polarization of the final state + can be readily measured.

Reference-contexts: We also recorded a sample of the weak radiative decay ffi 0 ! flfl which is about 7 times larger than that in the previous experiment [35]. Here too a self-analyzing final state hyperon provides information on sought-after <ref> [17] </ref> parity violating interference effects (asymmetry parameters). Additional analysis efforts are under way to observe the muonic beta decay ffi 0 ! + -, to study ffi 0 decays, and to search for the S = 2 second-order weak decay ffi 0 ! p .

Reference-contexts: We also plan to use our reference sample of 300,000 ffi 0 ! fl 0 decays to reduce the ffi 0 mass uncertainty (now 0:6 M eV =c 2 ) which currently limits the precision with which the Coleman-Glashow mass relation can be tested <ref> [18] </ref>. 2.6 Results of R 0 search A search for a light gluino, called the R 0 , through its dominant decay mode R 0 ! ~fl with ! + , has been performed on a one-day E832 data sample.

These results were recently published <ref> [21] </ref>. 3 Continuation of the Ongoing Program in 1999 A significant run in 1999 will be an important step in the continuing neutral kaon program at Fermilab.

Reference-contexts: A second process amenable to study with online calibrations is the weak radiative decay ffi 0 ! 0 fl. Theoretical predictions for the branching ratio and asymmetry parameter vary widely. There is only one experiment <ref> [34] </ref> in the literature with a sample of 85 events. Since ct for the 0 is very small (it decays electromagnetically), both photons effectively come from the same vertex.

Here too a self-analyzing final state hyperon provides information on sought-after [17] parity violating interference effects (asymmetry parameters). <p> KTeV97 KTeV97 Experiments Results + KTeV99 ffi 0 ! + e None 900 events 4400 events ffi 0 ! + None~20 events ~100 events ffi 0 ! 0 fl FNAL [34] 85 events 4600 events 22500 events (3:56 0:43) fi 10 3 ffi 0 ! flfl FNAL <ref> [35] </ref> 116 events 700 events 5000 events (1:06 0:16) fi 10 3 Table 7: Expected number of events for various ffi 0 decay modes being studied in KTeV.

Reference-contexts: Experiments with polarized Lambdas yield a measured value of A - = 0:821 0:060, about 2.5 standard deviations lower than expected. Similar hints are also found in decay data for other polarized hyperons <ref> [36] </ref>. It is this suggestion of new physics which continues to intrigue and excite us. While the most conventional interpretation of such a difference would be in terms of a non-zero value for the "second class" form factor g 2 , more exotic alternatives are certainly also possible [37].

A measurement in KTeV99 could reduce the experimental error by at least a factor of 3. Should this difference prove to be real, we could also explore its origin by examining other aspects of the decay angular distribution with high precision.

Reference-contexts: We have used data from the 1997 run to estimate the DAQ requirements for 1999 conditions. The 1997 run used a data acquisition system <ref> [39] </ref> provided by DART, a project within the Fermilab computing division. Data was read out over a FERA bus into VME memory modules using DART specific hardware (DYC, DC2) and software.

Reference-contexts: DART software support for online splitting, including software to spool data off disk and onto tape, databasing of which runs and types of events are written on which tapes, deleting runs once they are spooled, and requesting new tape mounts as needed. 4.6.4 Slow DAQ upgrades The KTeV Slow-DAQ system <ref> [40] </ref> was designed to interface with all the KTeV CAMAC crates, as well as monitoring temperatures, humidities, and voltages for the CsI and other detectors. Two SGI Indy machines, with SCSI-CAMAC interfaces supported by DART (the Jorway), were used to interface with the CAMAC crates.

Reference-contexts: A rather complete published report <ref> [41] </ref> describes the successful use of a TRD system in Fermilab experiment E769 to separate pions and protons in a 250 GeV/c incident charged hadron beam at "rates up to, and sometimes even exceeding, 2 MHz". <p> Chambers derived from standard 128-wire Fermilab sense planes [42] with aluminized 52 Mylar cathodes would provide a sensitive area appropriate for our decay protons. During KTeV97 we began preliminary studies of Fenker chamber performance in the neutral beam environment. Scaling from reference <ref> [41] </ref>, the 10-module system would be 1.2 m long which would fit in the available space. Radiators of suitable size, fixturing and materials for making the aluminized Mylar cathodes (with 85 nm Al coating), and appropriate high voltage supplies already exist at The University of Chicago.

Reference-contexts: With a 100 ns collection time, the TRD signals can also be used to reduce the Level 1 trigger rate and associated dead time. For instance, rejecting triggers with more than 8 hits would reduce the trigger rate by about 1/2.
