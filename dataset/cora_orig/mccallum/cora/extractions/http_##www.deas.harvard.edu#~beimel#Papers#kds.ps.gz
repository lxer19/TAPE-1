Abstract: A (g; b) key distribution scheme allows conferences of g users to generate secret keys, such that disjoint coalitions of b users cannot gain any information on the generated key (in the information theoretic sense). In this work, we study the relationships between communication and space efficiency of key distribution schemes. We prove that communication does not help in the context of unrestricted schemes. On the other hand, we show that for restricted schemes, which are secure only when used by a limited number of conferences, communication can substantially improve the space efficiency. We also present lower bounds on the space efficiency of restricted schemes. fl An extended abstract of this paper appears in "Advances in Cryptology - Crypto '93", Springer-Verlag, LNCS 773, D.R.

Reference-contexts: The (space) efficiency of a scheme is measured by the cardinality of the domain of pieces. The cardinality is a function of the cardinality of the domain of possible keys, jSj, the number of users, n, the size of conferences g, and the size of coalitions b. Blom <ref> [1] </ref> was the first to consider non-communicating schemes for conference of size 2 and coalitions of size b. He presented an efficient (2; b) scheme, based on MDS codes. The pieces in Blom's scheme are taken from a domain of cardinality jSj b+1 (where S is the domain of keys). <p> Then, I ( U 1 ; U 2 j U 3 ) H (S). We first deal with (2; b)-schemes. In the non-communicating (2; b)-scheme of Blom <ref> [1] </ref>, the cardinality of the domain of pieces is jSj b+1 . In Lemma 6.3 we prove that jSj b+1 is a lower bound even for one-time (2; b)-schemes. Thus, in this case communication does not help even if we consider only one-time schemes. <p> On the other hand, we do not require that all 2 2 strings that are given to the users are totally independent. It suffices that the server deals vectors of pieces according to the non-communicating (2; g + b 2) scheme of Blom <ref> [1] </ref> for n users, with keys taken from a domain of cardinality jSj 2=g = q 2 . The pads used in the generation of a key are the keys of this scheme. Before we discuss the security of the scheme, we consider its efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The pieces in Blom's scheme are taken from a domain of cardinality jSj b+1 (where S is the domain of keys). Matsumoto and Imai [2] suggested the use of symmetric linear functions for (g; b) schemes. Blundo, De Santis, Herzberg, Kutten, Vaccaro and Yung <ref> [3] </ref> present (g; b) schemes, based on symmetric multinomials. Their multinomials have g variables and degree at most b in each variable. The pieces in their scheme are taken from a domain of cardinality jSj ( g+b1 g1 ) . <p> The pieces in their scheme are taken from a domain of cardinality jSj ( g+b1 g1 ) . For large values of g and b, this expression is quite large. However, using entropy arguments, Blundo et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> prove a tight lower bound on the cardinality of the domain of pieces. Therefore, their scheme is space-optimal. In this work, we apply direct arguments (no entropy) to prove the same lower bound. Our proof has two advantages. First, in our opinion, it is more intuitive and less technical. <p> We construct an efficient one-time secure scheme, where the size of the domain of pieces is of cardinality jSj 2+2 (b1)=g . This is a substantial improvement over the jSj g+b1 cardinality in the one-time secure communicating scheme of <ref> [3] </ref>. (The fact that this scheme is only one-time secure was not mentioned in [3]). Following [3], our schemes are noninteractive: Each user sends messages which depend only on his piece of information and not on messages received from other users. <p> This is a substantial improvement over the jSj g+b1 cardinality in the one-time secure communicating scheme of <ref> [3] </ref>. (The fact that this scheme is only one-time secure was not mentioned in [3]). Following [3], our schemes are noninteractive: Each user sends messages which depend only on his piece of information and not on messages received from other users. Other, less efficient, one time secure communicating schemes are presented in [8, 9]. <p> This is a substantial improvement over the jSj g+b1 cardinality in the one-time secure communicating scheme of <ref> [3] </ref>. (The fact that this scheme is only one-time secure was not mentioned in [3]). Following [3], our schemes are noninteractive: Each user sends messages which depend only on his piece of information and not on messages received from other users. Other, less efficient, one time secure communicating schemes are presented in [8, 9]. <p> It is obvious that unrestricted non-communicating schemes are a special case of weak non-communicating schemes. Therefore, every lower bound for weak schemes implies the same lower bound for unrestricted non-communicating schemes. 3 A Lower Bound for Non-Communicating Schemes Blundo et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> prove a tight lower bound on the size of the pieces in every noncommunicating key distribution scheme. Their proof is based on the entropy function, and, in our opinion, does not reveal the intuition behind this lower bound. <p> Furthermore, in our proof we only use the weak security requirement. That is, even weak (g; b) schemes, where the entropy of the keys may be very low, must have large domain of pieces. Thus, our proof yields a stronger result than the lower bound of <ref> [3] </ref>. We use this stronger result in the sequel. Theorem 3.1: [3] Let U be a weak non-communicating (g; b) scheme with n users and domain of keys S. Let U i be the domain of pieces of user i in U . <p> That is, even weak (g; b) schemes, where the entropy of the keys may be very low, must have large domain of pieces. Thus, our proof yields a stronger result than the lower bound of <ref> [3] </ref>. We use this stronger result in the sequel. Theorem 3.1: [3] Let U be a weak non-communicating (g; b) scheme with n users and domain of keys S. Let U i be the domain of pieces of user i in U . <p> Let U i be the domain of pieces of user i in U then jU i j jSj ` : Notice that ` can be at most g1 . Using symmetric degree b multinomials with g variables, Blundo et. al <ref> [3] </ref> have constructed an unrestricted non-communicating (g; b) scheme with domains of pieces jU i j = jSj ( g+b1 g1 ) with uniform a-priori distribution on the keys (provided that jSj n and jSj is a prime power). <p> We first give a simple lower bound for every t -restricted (g; b) scheme. We show that for t g1 the cardinality of the domains of pieces in any t -restricted (g; b) scheme is at least jSj t . Therefore, for t g1 the unrestricted noncommunicating scheme of <ref> [3] </ref> are space optimal even with respect to t -restricted schemes. In addition, this shows that for restricted schemes with smaller t , some dependence on the size of t is unavoidable. We improve this bound for the case t (b=g) g . <p> Since Theorem 6.4 is proven by reduction to Lemma 6.3 then proving a jSj b+1 lower bound for weak one time (2; b) schemes suffices for proving the lower bound for every g. 7 Upper Bounds for Restricted Schemes Blundo et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> present a one-time (g; b)-scheme in which the domain of pieces of each user is of cardinality jSj g+b1 . (In [3] it is not pointed out that this scheme is only onetime secure). <p> b+1 lower bound for weak one time (2; b) schemes suffices for proving the lower bound for every g. 7 Upper Bounds for Restricted Schemes Blundo et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> present a one-time (g; b)-scheme in which the domain of pieces of each user is of cardinality jSj g+b1 . (In [3] it is not pointed out that this scheme is only onetime secure). We improve their one-time scheme, and present a one-time key distribution scheme in which the domain of pieces of each user is of cardinality jSj 2+2 (b1)=g .

Reference-contexts: Hence, the dependence on t of the domain of pieces in our scheme cannot be completely avoided. We contrast our results with known ones in the computational model, where attacks of coalitions are restricted to probabilistic polynomial time computations. Diffie and Hell-man <ref> [10] </ref>, in their pioneering work on public key cryptography, introduced a communicating scheme of key generation for conferences of size two 1 . This communicating scheme requires no server and no pieces.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, even in the computational model, a non-communicating scheme requires pieces taken from a domain which is at least as large as the domain of keys. So in the computational model, communication does reduce the size of pieces, up to complete elimination. Fiat and Naor <ref> [11] </ref> present a non-communicating (n 1; 1)-scheme in the computational model. In their scheme, which is based on the assumed intractability of extracting root modulo composites (RSA), the domain of pieces has the same cardinality as the domain of keys.
