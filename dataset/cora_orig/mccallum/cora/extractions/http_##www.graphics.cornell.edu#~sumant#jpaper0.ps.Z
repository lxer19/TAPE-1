Abstract: This paper presents a new view-independent, energy equilibrium method for determining the light distributed in a complex 3D environment consisting of surfaces with general reflectance properties. The method does not depend on discretisation of directions or discretisation of surfaces to differential elements. Hence, it is a significant improvement over the earlier complete view-indepedent method which is computationally intractable for complex environments or the hybrid methods which include an extended view-dependent ray tracing second pass. The new method is based on an efficient data structure of order O(N 2 ) named as the spherical cover. The spherical cover elegantly captures the complex multidimensional directional nature of light distributed over surfaces. Subdivision techniques based on range estimation of various parameters using interval arithmetic like methods are next described for efficiently computing the spherical cover for a given 3D environment. Using the spherical cover, light is progressively propagated through the environment until energy equilibrium is reached. Complexity analysis of the propagation step is carried out to show that the method is computationally tractable. The paper also includes a comprehensive review of earlier rendering techniques viewed from the point of capturing the multidimensional nature of light distribution over surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Examples of optical properties are colour, opacity, transparency, absorbivity, shinyness, surface finish, emissivity, etc. Properly modeling the nature of these optical properties is essential and has been addressed by researchers in other disciplines such as radiometry <ref> [4] </ref>. For reasons of computational efficiency, simplified models have been in use in computer graphics and computer vision [5,6]. This paper is concerned with the development of algorithms for the visualisation of complex 3D environments with varying optical properties dealing directly with the exact geometrical forms. <p> The object brightness is the object radiance. Image irradiance is proportional to object radiance and the constant of proportionally depends on the imaging system used. The definition of the terms radiance and irradiance can be found in the study of radiometry <ref> [4] </ref>. Irradiance is the amount of light energy falling on a surface. It is the power per unit area incident on the surface and has the unit watts per square metre. Radiance is the amount of light energy irradiated from a surface.

Reference-contexts: Visualisation of such scenes involves the synthesis of images depicting or rendering the surfaces of objects as seen from different view points. Image synthesis <ref> [7] </ref> is thus, the process of converting a 3-dimensional geometric representation with associated optical properties into a visual representation mostly on a 2D medium such as a CRT display screen or a photographic plate.

Reference-contexts: However, using the above equation brightness is computed only at visible points on surfaces in the environment and only in the viewing direction [8,9]. Diffuse as well as specular properties could be associated with surfaces. The methods were extended to directly render curved surfaces <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 One major problem with these techniques is that the illumination function models are very local. They do not take into account the fact that brightly lit surfaces themselves act like light sources and illuminate others.

Reference-contexts: Thus in these models inter-reflections, refractions and other such global effects were not modeled. 2.2 Ray Tracing Techniques In the basic ray tracing technique <ref> [11] </ref>, once again, illumination functions are not explicitly stored over any surfaces in the environment. The image rectangle is assumed to be a matrix of pixels and the brightness function is determined for each pixel in the view direction only.

Reference-contexts: Recursion is carried out to some finite depth. The basic problem in this formulation is that only the reflected view direction is given importance, effectively capturing the specular behaviour of the surfaces. The effect of brightly lit diffuse surfaces is, however, not properly captured. Extensions to ray tracing <ref> [12] </ref> came in the form of a careful choice of a bundle of (; ) directions to be chosen at any surface point when determining its illumination. In distributed ray tracing, [13] stochastic sampling techniques were used in order to choose the (; ) directions distributed over the hemisphere.

Reference-contexts: Even though early attempts dealt with planar approximations of the environment, geometric computations were extended to deal directly with complex geometry [14,15]. Ward, et.al <ref> [16] </ref> describe an interesting extension of ray tracing for diffuse surfaces. Perhaps, their's is the only ray tracing method which stores the illumination explicitly on the surfaces and yet is a single pass technique. To start with brightness is known only at point light sources.

Reference-contexts: Two pass methods differ in their method of storing the illumination function on surfaces and in the methods employed in computing the approximate estimates for these. For example, <ref> [17] </ref> Arvo stores brightness at each one of a rectangular matrix of points on each surface. Bilinear interpolation is chosen for intermediate values. Only diffuse behaviour is considered for this.

Reference-contexts: Bilinear interpolation is chosen for intermediate values. Only diffuse behaviour is considered for this. Brightness is estimated by tracing rays from light sources to all points in the rectangular matrix of points in each surface. Similarly, Chattopadhyay and Fujimoto <ref> [18] </ref> store the illumination at points in a uniform grid in the total three dimensional environment. This illumination is computed by transferring the brightness from diffuse surfaces whose illumination is approximated as in the early techniques, i.e., direct contribution of point light sources.

Reference-contexts: Ra-diosity techniques will be reviewed in the next subsection. In these techniques [19,20] the approximate illumination estimated in the first pass is stored as brightness at the centre of a small planar patch. Shao et.al <ref> [21] </ref> store a directionally dependent brightness function using a hemicube centred at each point of a specular surface patch. They present an iterative method of improving these initial estimates, which they call as procedural refinement. All of these two pass techniques store the brightness emitting from the surface.

Reference-contexts: All of these two pass techniques store the brightness emitting from the surface. Using the brightness values at all other surface points visible to any point on a surface in the environment the illumination function can always be computed. Buckalew et.al <ref> [22] </ref> on the other hand, explicitly store both the E and the I functions over each of the surfaces in the environment. This is done by maintaining a patch-link network data structure. Each incoming link is representative of a particular (; ) direction of the E function at the patch.

Reference-contexts: As argued by the authors themselves, in the limiting case with infinite links, this can capture all possible illumination effects. In practice, however, the data structures can be prohibitively large. 2.4 Radiosity Techniques Radiosity techniques are based on the energy equilibrium concept used in radiative heat transfer computations <ref> [23] </ref>. These are the very first techniques which modeled the illumination function not as delta functions in the ( s ; s ) directions but as integrals over finite area light sources [24]. They also could accurately take into account all diffuse inter-reflections.

Reference-contexts: In an attempt to solve this equation the (; ) space was discretised to D directions <ref> [25] </ref>. The double integration was simplified to summation by discretising the environment to near differential patches. <p> In summary for completely diffuse plus perfect mirror environments, the complexity of propagation is same as the basic radiosity technique. For general environments, the worst case complexity is O (N D). But the average complexity will be lower. In comparison in the earlier view independent method <ref> [25] </ref>, when it is modeled not as a set of N D linear equations but as progressive propagation, the worst case complexity of the propagation step is O (D 2 ), where D is the number of discretised directions. Note that, in general, D &gt; N .

Reference-contexts: There is a major representational issue to be considered before we end this discussion on the spherical cover | the representation of h ij and hence H i . The hemicube introduced by Cohen et.al <ref> [26] </ref>, is a potential candidate and has been used to capture directional brightness [21,25]. H i would be the union of all the cells on the hemicube and h ij would be a connected subset of cells of the hemicube.

Rendering is a simple task given the illumination.

Fig. 9 shows a doubly curved patch being subdivided using this criteria. Interval methods proposed in <ref> [33] </ref> have been used. As can be seen, many large visible/shadowed regions get identified very early in the subdivision process.
