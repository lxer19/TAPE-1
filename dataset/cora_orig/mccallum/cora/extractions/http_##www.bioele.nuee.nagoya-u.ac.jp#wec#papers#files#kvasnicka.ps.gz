Abstract: Simple modification of standard hill climbing optimization algorithm by taking into account learning features is discussed. Basic concept of this approach is the socalled probability vector, its single entries determine probabilities of appearance of '1' entries in n-bit vectors. This vector is used for the random generation of n-bit vectors that form a neighborhood (specified by the given probability vector). Within the neighborhood a few best solutions (with smallest functional values of a minimized function) are recorded. The feature of learning is introduced here so that the probability vector is updated by a formal analogue of Hebbian learning rule, well-known in the theory of artificial neural networks. The process is repeated until the probability vector entries are close either to zero or to one. The resulting probability vector unambiguously determines an n-bit vector which may be interpreted as an optimal solution of the given optimization task. Resemblance with genetic algorithms is discussed. Effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by an example of looking for global minima of a highly multimodal function.

The main conclusion from these calculations is that the present method offers results that are comparable or even better than those obtained by the genetic algorithm specified in details in Baluja's technical report <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The obtained results are summarized in Table 1. This results are accompanied by similar results obtained by the genetic algorithm specified as follows: Algorithm used after Baluja <ref> [1] </ref>, size of population 1000, number of generation 2000, probability of single bit mutation 0.01, all chromosomes are replaced by offspring. We see that the HCwL offers for different number of variables slightly better results than the genetic algorithm.
