Abstract: The problem of accurate depth estimation using stereo in the presence of specular reflection is addressed. Specular reflection, a fundamental and ubiquitous reflection mechanism, is viewpoint dependent and can cause large intensity differences at corresponding points, resulting in significant depth errors. We analyze the physics of specular reflection and the geometry of stereopsis which lead to a relationship between stereo vergence, surface roughness, and the likelihood of a correct match. Given a lower bound on surface roughness, an optimal binocular stereo configuration can be determined which maximizes precision in depth estimation despite specular reflection. However, surface roughness is difficult to estimate in unstructured environments. Therefore, trinocular configurations, independent of surface roughness, are determined such that at each scene point visible to all sensors, at least one stereo pair can produce correct depth. We have developed a simple algorithm to reconstruct depth from the multiple stereo pairs.

Reference-contexts: The robustness of a stereo system is characterized to a large extent by its ability to obtain accurate depth estimates of scenes comprising objects with different reflectance properties. The stereo correspondence problem <ref> [1] </ref> is inherently under-constrained. Therefore, constraints have to be imposed by making assumptions regarding scene reflectance and structure. A common assumption is that intensities at corresponding points in the images are identical.

Reference-contexts: I diff varies over the scene as the surface normal and roughness are generally not constant. The local variance of I diff (in a window, for example) could be large if the viewing directions are chosen arbitrarily, resulting in wrong matches while computing stereo correspondence using linear correlation methods <ref> [2] </ref>. specular intensity is different in the two sensors. at a point with some surface roughness. <p> This mean value is called the field vergence. If the workspace is defined explicitly in world coordinates, then a relation can be obtained between the field vergence and baseline <ref> [2] </ref>. Therefore, the baseline indirectly controls I diff over the workspace. Hereon, we will refer to both point vergence and field ver-gence as simply vergence. Vergence is related to depth resolution, an important design parameter. Depth accuracy, and hence resolution, are limited by spatial image quantization amongst other factors. <p> Vergence is related to depth resolution, an important design parameter. Depth accuracy, and hence resolution, are limited by spatial image quantization amongst other factors. The depth resolution attainable at any point is directly proportional to vergence <ref> [2] </ref>, assuming quantization is the primary cause for matching errors. <p> From a statistical perspective, restricting Idif f amounts to limiting the variance of specular intensity difference in any local region <ref> [2] </ref>. The cameras are restricted to lie in the positive x-z plane, and tilt symmetrically about the z-axis. These constraints (c2) can be expressed as: ^v 1 ^ j = ^v 2 ^ j = 0 2 The workspace could be the entire stereo field of view. <p> If ~ v opt approximates v opt , then ~ v = (T =K s ) 2 + b 2 (9) where a and b are constants obtained numerically <ref> [2] </ref>. To make the relationship in Figure 5 usable, a correspondence operator is required which is sensitive to changes in the relative threshold and degrades gracefully. The normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) measures the degree of linear relationship between intensities in image windows. <p> A closely related stereo operator, the sum of squared differences (SSD), can also be made sensitive to variations in relative threshold <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 We ignore noise, and geometrical distortion in the windows. The exact value of the relative threshold when mismatches begin to occur (the breaking threshold) depends on diffuse texture of the surface which are diverse, making its estimation a hard problem. <p> We use two uniformly rough (a) (b) with a camera fixed to its end-effector. The coordinate system is also shown; (b) A photograph of the setting. cylindrical objects wrapped with different surfaces (see Figure 7); a gift wrapper and a roughened xerox quality paper. Their surface roughness was measured <ref> [2] </ref>, and the values obtained are = 3:5 ffi and = 6:3 ffi , respectively. It can be also be seen from the the images in Figure 7. In order to use approximately the same relative threshold, similar random patterns on the surfaces were marked. <p> Notice that for both surfaces, depth is incorrectly recovered at larger vergence, although a relatively higher vergence is acceptable for the rougher surface. accurately computed in at least one stereo pair, regardless of surface roughness. While the configuration need not be limited to three sensors <ref> [2] </ref>, increasing the number of sensors makes stereo implementation cumbersome. We analyze a planar symmetric trinocular stereo system (see Figure 9) with ff as a single configurable parameter. <p> The mapping under orthographic projection is given in <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, we establish consistent correspondence for x L in the three images. Compute depth using x L and x R and go to step 2. <p> The complexity increases in proportion to the number of switches between stereo pairs. If the surface geometry is known, then the switching sequence and the total complexity can actually be evaluated <ref> [2] </ref>. 8 Experiments We present trinocular stereo experiments with objects of different roughness. Here we do not estimate surface roughness as required in the case of binocular stereo. Figure 6 shows the photograph of the experimental stereo setup used.

Reference-contexts: Removal of highlights is difficult in images of real scenes and is an active area of research [7]. Ching et al [5] developed an empirical correlation based technique to detect and avoid specular reflection when the camera is active. On a different note, Blake <ref> [3] </ref> related the movement of a highlight to the Hessian of the surface which describes local surface geometry. The above techniques assume ideal specular reflection which is only an extreme case as surface roughness tends to zero. Current stereo algorithms are therefore seriously deficient in dealing with specular reflection. <p> Our approach considers specular reflection from rough surfaces in the context of stereo. All previous methods have implicitly [5] or explicitly <ref> [3] </ref> assumed ideal specular reflection. We do not attempt to avoid or detect the immediate artifacts of specular reflection like strong highlights but rather perform accurate matching in their presence. Thus, preprocessing of images, like removal of highlights, is avoided.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, constraints have to be imposed by making assumptions regarding scene reflectance and structure. A common assumption is that intensities at corresponding points in the images are identical. Based on this supposition, various search based strategies have been developed which correlate image regions (area-based) [9], or image features (feature-based) <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this assumption is valid only when the surfaces in the scene are Lambertian. Corresponding point intensities are not identical in the presence of specular reflection, the specular intensity at any scene point being dependent on the viewing direction.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore easy to incorporate into existing stereo algorithms. 2 Reflection Mechanisms Surfaces exhibit two forms of reflectance diffuse and specular. Diffuse reflection occurs due to subsurface scattering of light. It is often assumed to be Lambertian, an assumption shown to be incorrect for surfaces with macroscopic roughness <ref> [10] </ref>. Nonetheless, the change in diffuse component with viewing direction is generally much less pronounced than the change in specular component. 2.1 Specular Reflection Specular reflection occurs at the boundary between surface and medium. It comprises of two components a spike and a lobe [8].

Reference-contexts: Hence, specular reflection refers to the lobe only. The specular lobe spreads in directions other than and including the specular direction, the width of the distribution depending on the roughness of the surface. This is described by the Torrance-Sparrow model <ref> [11] </ref> which is briefly outlined below. A surface is viewed as a collection of planar microfacets, each behaving like a perfect mirror. A rough surface can be modelled using a probability distribution for the slopes of the microfacets. The slope distribution model uses a parameter which represents surface roughness.
