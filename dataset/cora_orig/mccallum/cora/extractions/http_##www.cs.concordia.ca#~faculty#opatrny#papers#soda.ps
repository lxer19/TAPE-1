Title: All-to-All Optical Routing in Optimal Chordal Rings of Degree Four  
Author: L. Narayanan J. Opatrny D. Sotteau 
Abstract: We consider the problem of routing in networks employing all-optical routing technology. In such networks, information between nodes of the network is transmitted as light on fiber-optic lines without being converted to electronic form in between. We consider switched optical networks that use the wavelength-division multiplexing (or WDM) approach. A WDM network consists of nodes connected by point-to-point fiber-optic links, each of which can support a fixed number of wavelengths. The switches are capable of redirecting incoming streams based on wavelengths, without changing the wavelengths. Different messages may use the same link concurrently if they are assigned distinct wavelengths. However, messages assigned the same wavelength must be assigned edge-disjoint paths. Given a communication instance in a network, the optical routing problem is the assignment of routes to communication requests of the instance, as well as wavelengths to routes so that the number of wavelengths used by the instance is minimal. We focus on the all-to-all communication instance I A in a widely studied family of chordal rings of degree 4,

In this paper we investigate the wavelength index for the instance I A in a family of chordal rings of degree 4. <p> Since optimal chordal rings and tori are both networks of degree four, it is interesting to compare the wavelength indices of G D and a torus with approximately the same number of vertices. As shown in <ref> [3] </ref>, for a two-dimensional torus G on n vertices, ~(G; I A ) = ~w (G; I A ) = n 3=2 =8.

Reference-contexts: Finding ~w (G; I) is also NP-hard for arbitrary G and I. In fact, it is known to be NP-hard for specific graphs such as trees and cycles [10]. Approximation algorithms for ~w (G; I) have been given for a variety of specific cases <ref> [4] </ref>. In what follows, we make several choices that restrict the scope of solutions for wavelength routing. First, we always consider instances which contain both requests (y; x) and (x; y) or neither. <p> Finally we always choose to assign the same color to P (y; x) and P (x; y). Note that in general this choice may preclude an optimal assignment (see <ref> [4] </ref>). An all-to-all communication pattern, denoted by I A , consists of all ordered pairs of nodes in the graph. I k denotes the set of all ordered pairs of nodes at distance at most k in the graph. <p> I k denotes the set of all ordered pairs of nodes at distance at most k in the graph. The optical routing problem has been studied for I A in various networks (see <ref> [4] </ref>). In particular, the question of whether for all symmetric digraphs, the optimal load and optimal wavelength index for the all-to-all instance are equal is still open (see [4]): Is ~w (G; I A ) = ~(G; I A ) for any symmetric digraph G?

It turns out that for any network for which ~w (G; I A ) has been determined so far, the load and wavelength index are in fact the same.
