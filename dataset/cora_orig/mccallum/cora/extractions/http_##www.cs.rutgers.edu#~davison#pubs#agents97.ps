Reference-contexts: This paper describes our ongoing efforts on building such pattern-recognizing agents into a UNIX shell, in particular, through the addition of a personalized software agent | a "personal assistant" <ref> (Mitchell et al. 1994) </ref> | to the UNIX shell tcsh. Before displaying a user's command-line prompt, the agent extrapolates from the user's past interactions with the shell and makes a prediction concerning what the user's next command will be.

Reference-contexts: The approach taken here is to learn such functions by passively watching the user interact with the shell, and from such observations learn to predict the next command. This "learning apprentice" approach <ref> (Mitchell, Mahadevan, & Steinberg 1985) </ref> gathers data by recording, after executing each command, the state of the user's session with the shell and what command was executed.

Reference-contexts: For command prediction we create datapoints for learning described by two attributes | the previous two commands (without arguments) | with each datapoint labeled by the command name that was executed. Learning is performed by the decision-tree learner C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref>. Evaluation An important question that must be addressed by developers of any personal software assistant is evaluation. When relevant, one common technique is to measure the predictor's success rate | how often its guess matches the user's actual command.
