Abstract: Preprocessing data is a means for improving the computational efficiency of concept learning systems. The selection of relevant features increasingly becomes a central problem in machine learning. Two different approaches were intensively studied these last few years, the filter and the wrapper methods. Both methods wish to give a learner only those attributes that are relevant to the target concept. Lattice based machine learning systems seems to better represent concepts inside the data. Several systems using this framework have been developed recently. Their principal drawback comes from the exponential complexity of the lattice construction. In this paper, we present a method to select relevant features according to the learning algorithm criteria. A first application is made to bring up a new lattice-based machine learning system, LEGAL-F, which decreases considerably the computational complexity of the previous LEGAL system. A study of the theoretical complexity of LEGAL-F is done, and experimental comparisons are reported first between LEGAL and LEGAL-F in terms of complexity, and then between LEGAL-F and C4.5 in terms of classification accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The selection of relevant features is an interdisciplinary domain of research. It seems both to improve accuracy results and reduce the complexity, of ML systems. Two different approaches to this major problem are proposed: the filter solution <ref> [AD94] </ref> which does not depend on the learning algorithm used and the wrapper method [JKP94] which relies on the algorithm threshold to evaluate the feature set. Both methods have their drawbacks. The first one is general enough to improve all algorithms.

Reference-contexts: One of the most known decision tree systems is ID3 [Qui86] which plays an increasingly important role in ML. The last decade has witnessed several variants of this system [Qui93]. In this paper, we will deal with a different kind of technique based on Galois lattices <ref> [BM70] </ref> or Concept lattices [Wil92]. The major difference between decision trees and lattices comes from the way that knowledge are represented, and the time used for this representation. However, learning lattices is exponential while learning trees is polynomial in the number of instances.

Reference-contexts: It is clearly shown that concept lattice is a general framework in which other learning TDIS strategies can be expressed. Many algorithms were proposed to build the concept lattice. Bordat <ref> [Bor86] </ref> was the first to describe an algorithm which uses a top-down approach to build the mathematical structure of the concept lattice. Godin [God89] investigates practical computational complexity as lattice construction also depends on initial context. Results indicate that lattice complexity can be polynomial according to the number of objects.

Reference-contexts: However, learning lattices is exponential while learning trees is polynomial in the number of instances. The past few years have witnessed the development of some lattice-based ML systems, including GALOIS <ref> [CR93] </ref>, LEGAL [MN94] and RULEARNER [Sah95]. These papers demonstrate that concept lattice systems can work as well as other sophisticated machine learning techniques. Among these systems, LEGAL has the weakliest theoretical complexity since it only builds a join-semi-lattice while the others build a complete lattice. <p> Results of the experimentations performed to date show that the classification accuracy obtained with LEGAL-F is as good as some lattice-based learning systems such as RULEARNER [Sah95]. Also as LEGAL-F builds only a semi-lattice during learning process, its running time is considerably lower than that of RULEARNER or GALOIS <ref> [CR93] </ref> systems which build all the complete concept lattice before selecting the best nodes. 6 Conclusion In this paper a method to select relevant features is presented and applied to outperform an existing ML system, namely LEGAL. LEGAL uses the framework of Galois lattice for concept learning.

Carpineto <ref> [CR96] </ref> implemented an incremental algorithm to design a lattice conceptual clustering system applied to browsing retrieval. This incremental approach builds all the concept lattice, and comes out with a practical lattice construction time complexity ranging from linear to quadratic, even if it is exponential in theory.
