Reference-contexts: Feature extraction preprocessing The data is captured by the x and y movement of the pen on a digitizing tablet. A series of points is combined into a stroke, and a series of strokes is combined into a scribble <ref> (after GO 1991, Chapter 15, and Morita et al. 1991) </ref>. The algorithm assumes that the point sampling rate is constant over time. This is not a perfect assumption, but averaging makes it workable. The feature extractor divides the scribble into several (4, 5, 6 or 7) intervals.
