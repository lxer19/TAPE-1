Abstract: This paper describes a powerful, yet practical, formalism for modeling and controlling imprecise FD-based inference in relational database systems. The formalism provides a canonical representation of inference which unifies precise inference and the primitive imprecise inference mechanisms of abduction and partial deduction. Whereas other imprecise (partial) inference models estimate the probability of making inferences, the formalism supports the analysis of the actual imprecise values inferred in a database extension. Imprecise inference is analyzed by transforming a precise database augmented with additional "catalytic" relations, conveying possibly imprecise a priori knowledge, into an equivalent imprecise database. The analysis of imprecise inference and the related inference control methodology are highly flexible and robust. They can be directly applied to classical, MLS, and imprecise databases. With minimal modifications, they also can be used in knowledge discovery or database mining.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Lunt and colleagues at SRI International [5,15,18] have developed an interactive tool, DISSECT, for detecting and eliminating compositional inference channels due to foreign key FDs. The DISSECT model builds on earlier work on inference control, including tools and techniques developed by Buczkowski <ref> [1] </ref>, Thuraisingham [23,24], and Hinke [9]. The current version of DISSECT [18] is limited to analyzing MLS database schemas (intensions) rather than actual MLS relations (extensions). Nevertheless, its success shows that it is possible to develop practical tools for dealing with the difficult problem of inference control. <p> He viewed inference as a means to "localize the space of possible values." A unique feature of his approach is its use of constraint expressions involving "spheres of influence" to capture logical inference and an information-theoretic (entropy) measure for imprecise information. The inference control tool developed by Buczkowski <ref> [1] </ref> uses Bayesian probability to estimate security risks due to imprecise inference; his model extends Morgenstern's framework to permit the propagation of imprecise inference. Garvey and Lunt [4,6,10] have characterized inference channels, including partial inference channels due to abduction and probabilistic reasoning.

Reference-contexts: To distinguish it from probability-based models, we use the term "imprecise" rather than "partial" to characterize the inference model. The imprecise inference model is highly flexible and robust. Imprecise inference is analyzed by transforming a precise database, possibly augmented with additional "catalytic" relations <ref> [8] </ref> conveying a priori knowledge available to low users, into an equivalent imprecise database. This technique, which is similar to those used in deductive databases, is particularly suited to modeling the propagation of compromising imprecise inferences in MLS databases. <p> This relation corresponds to "catalytic data" <ref> [8] </ref> added to a database by the DBA to materialize imprecise inference channels due to common knowledge. The coarse context C Sal 1 = f [0K, 50K), [50K, 100K)g enables imprecise salaries to be stored consistently in R 1 . A precise context is used for attribute Emp 1 . <p> This set conveys the finest information that can be inferred without compromising database security. It typically contains simple channels composed of FDs holding in the database relations being analyzed and those holding in additional catalytic relations. As mentioned earlier, catalytic relations <ref> [8] </ref> are additional relations added to the database being analyzed. They convey common knowledge about secure attribute values and are used to materialize potentially compromising imprecise inferences that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 4.5: XY (C X C Y ) ! Z (C Z ) implies X (C X ) ! Z (I XY !Z (C X ? Y )). Precise inference channels are composed of a "use set" of FDs <ref> [12] </ref>. Likewise, imprecise inference channels are composed of a use set of imprecise FDs. An imprecise inference channel is a chain of imprecise FDs, usually represented as a directed acyclic graph (dag).

Reference-contexts: Determining the closure of inference for a set of imprecise FDs is critical to analyzing imprecise inference. The classical model uses Armstrong's axioms in defining the FD-based inference closure. Counterparts to Armstrong's axioms exist for context-based imprecise FDs <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the counterparts to Armstrong's axioms, new axioms specific to imprecise FDs exist <ref> [21] </ref>. The following inference axiom states that if an information chunk x determines some chunk y using an imprecise FD, then information more precise than x can determine information less precise than y. <p> As seen in Section 2, deductive and abductive inference can be unified using the idea of an induced FD. In the context model, an induced FD is an imprecise FD defined in terms of "induced contexts" <ref> [21] </ref>. For a relation containing attributes X and Y , the induced context is the finest context for Y that yields an imprecise FD from X to Y with context C X for X. <p> A similar assumption is used in the DISSECT system. We examine individual inference paths in the hypergraph constructed from inference analysis for suspected compromise. For inference path exploration, the hypergraph can be reduced to a regular graph whose vertices are hyperdges <ref> [21] </ref>. That is, a hyperedge E (a;b) with hypernodes a and b becomes a vertex V E (a;b) in a regular graph. <p> The derived inference channel IC 2 is presented in Figure 2. Detecting imprecise inference compromises is an NP-complete problem <ref> [21] </ref>. This follows from the fact that imprecise inference compromise detection generalizes the problem of detecting precise FD-based inference channels; the latter was shown to be NP-complete by Su and Ozsoyoglu [19,20]. Exhaustive search is the obvious strategy for detecting compromising channels. <p> Exhaustive search is the obvious strategy for detecting compromising channels. Large databases will require the use of heuristics for compromise 12 detection. Effective and practical heuristics for compromise detection are presented in <ref> [21] </ref>. Allowing for user interaction during the detection phase enhances the quality of the search. 5.2.2 Compromise Elimination Securing a database system from imprecise inference attacks based on FDs mandates securing all potentially compromising imprecise inference channels. Each channel can be secured by hiding (upgrading) relational attributes [18-20].
