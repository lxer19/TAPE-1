Title: Two-Layer Linear Structures for Fast Adaptive Filtering  
Author: Fran~coise Beaufays, Bernard Widrow 
Date: June 4-9, 1994  
Note: Proc. WCNN'94 San Diego,  
Abstract: The LMS algorithm invented by Widrow and Hoff in 1959 is the simplest, most robust, and one of the most widely used algorithms for adaptive filtering. Unfortunately, it suffers from high sensitivity to the conditioning of its input autocorrelation matrix: the higher the input eigenvalue spread, the slower the convergence of the adaptive weights. This problem can be overcome by preprocessing the inputs to the LMS filter with a fixed data-independent transformation that, at least partially, decorrelates the inputs. Typically, the preprocessing consists of a DFT or a DCT transformation followed by a power normalization stage. The resulting algorithms are called DFT-LMS and DCT-LMS. A fast and robust implementation of the DFT or the DCT preprocessing stage is itself obtained by using an adaptive filter based on the LMS algorithm. The overall structure is thus a fully adaptive two-layer linear filter, which achieves better speed performance than pure LMS while retaining its low computational cost and its extreme robustness.

Reference-contexts: The performance of algorithms based on data-independent transformations clearly depends on the orthogonalizing capabilities of the transform used. No general proof exists that demonstrates the superiority of one transform over the others. DFT-LMS first introduced by Narayan <ref> [1] </ref> is the simplest algorithm of this family, mainly because of the exponential nature of the DFT. It is our experience though that in most practical situations DCT-LMS performs much better than DFT-LMS [2]. In addition, it has the advantage of being real-valued.

Since the signals x k ; x k1 ; ::: come from a tap-delay line, their DFT/DCT at a given iteration can easily be calculated recursively from the DFT/DCT at the previous iteration.

Reference-contexts: However, in this approach, the propagation and accumulation of errors due for example to round-off noise in floating point arithmetic makes it necessary to often reset the DFT/DCT. This increases the overall number of computations and adds to the complexity of the circuitry. The LMS spectrum analyzer <ref> [3] </ref> provides another way of computing a DFT recursively in O (N ) operations, but because it relies on an adaptive technique, it automatically adjusts for possible errors. In the next sections, we will recall the principle of the LMS spectrum analyzer and demonstrate its robustness to noise propagation. <p> This is to be contrasted with the conventional DFT, which is O (N 2 ), or its butterfly counterpart, the FFT, which is O (N logN ). LMS spectrum analyzer. The LMS spectrum analyzer <ref> [3] </ref> is represented in Figure 2. The signal to be transformed, d F k (we will see shortly how d F k relates to x k ), is used as the desired output of an adaptive filter. <p> Replacing e F k in the weight update formula, chosing the initial weight vector W F 0 to be equal to zero and the learning rate to be equal to 1/2, and using the periodicity and orthonormality properties of the complex phasors F k , it can be shown <ref> [3] </ref> that W F k1 X d F k X d F Comparing with the DFT formula (Eq.5), it is clear that if we choose d F m1 = x m , the DFT and the LMS analyzer weights are related by the simple formula: DF T k = P k

Reference-contexts: The input to the filter at time k is the complex phasor F k . The adaptive weights of the spectrum analyzer are updated with the complex LMS algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> : W F k + 2 e F 3 where W F k and e F k are respectively the weight vector and the error signal at time k, and is the learning rate.

Reference-contexts: LMS spectrum analyzer for the DCT As pointed out previously, it is our experience that in many applications the DCT-LMS algorithm achieves better results than the DFT-LMS. There exist many different discrete cosine transforms <ref> [5] </ref>, the one of interest here is defined as DCT N1 (p) = 2 k p m=0 N ; (21) where DCT N1 (p) is the p th component of the DCT at time N 1, and the constant k p = 1= p for p = 0 and 1 otherwise.
