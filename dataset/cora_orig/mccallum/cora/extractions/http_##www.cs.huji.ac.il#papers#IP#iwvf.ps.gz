Abstract: Symmetry is treated as a continuous feature, and the Symmetry Distance (SD) of a shape is defined to be the minimum distance required to move points of the original shape in order to obtain a symmetrical shape. This general definition of a symmetry measure enables a comparison of the "amount" of symmetry of different shapes and the "amount" of different symmetries of a single shape. The measure is applicable to any type of symmetry in any dimension. The Symmetry Distance gives rise to a method of reconstructing symmetry of occluded shapes. We extend the method to deal with symmetries of noisy and fuzzy data.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the basic features of shapes and objects is symmetry. Symmetry is considered a pre-attentive feature which enhances recognition and reconstruction of shapes and objects <ref> [2] </ref>. Symmetry is also an important parameter in physical and chemical processes and is an important criterion in medical diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: The normalization presents an upper bound of on the mean squared distance moved by points of the shape. Thus the SD value is limited in range, where SD=0 for perfectly symmetric shapes (see Appendix in <ref> [9] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Additionally we replace R i the rota tion matrix with R = sin 2 cos 2 the reflection about an axis at an angle to the x-axis. The angle is found analyticaly (see <ref> [10] </ref>) thus the dimensionality of the problem is 2q + 1 (rather than 2q + 2) and elimination of the last row and column of matrix U (see Sect 6.1) allows an inverse solution as in the rotational symmetry case.
