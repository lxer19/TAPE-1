Abstract: In a normative system many of the obligations, prohibitions and permissions exist as a result of communication with users and/or other systems. In this paper we will discuss the role of illocutionary logic and deontic logic in modelling these communication processes and the resulting norms. The combination of illocutionary and deontic logic can be used to reason about communication structures. The use of deontic logic also makes it possible to describe the course of action in the cases that the communication protocol fails. This is of particular interest for the specification of flexible transactions in the context of interoperable systems.

Reference-contexts: The illocutionary point of an illocutionary act indicates the type of effect for which the act is performed. Five different illocutionary points are distinguished: - assertives directives - commisives declarations - expressives This distinction is directly related to the "direction of fit" of speech acts (Austin <ref> (1962) </ref> 1 ): word-to-world or world-to-word. An assertive speech act has a word-to-world fit. Such an act simply makes a statement about the state of affairs in the world. Therefore the propositional contents should conform with the state of affairs in the world. E.g. "The cat is on the mat".

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will discuss the role of illocutionary logic and deontic logic in modelling the communication processes described above and their resulting norms. Illocutionary logic (Searle & Vanderveken <ref> (1985) </ref> 8 ) is a logical formalisation of the theory of speech acts (Searle (1969) 9 ) and is used to formally describe the communication structure itself.

Reference-contexts: This is typically done on the request of another agent. The life cycle of the agent consists of processing incoming messages, checking the agenda, and performing the actions due at that time. Agents communicate by means of messages. According to speech act theory (Searle <ref> (1969) </ref> 9 ), a message consists of an illocution operator and a propositional content. We make a rough distinction between directive messages, that deal with the agendas of the agents, and assertive messages, that act upon the agent's database. This distinction will be refined below. <p> In this paper we will discuss the role of illocutionary logic and deontic logic in modelling the communication processes described above and their resulting norms. Illocutionary logic (Searle & Vanderveken (1985) 8 ) is a logical formalisation of the theory of speech acts (Searle <ref> (1969) </ref> 9 ) and is used to formally describe the communication structure itself. In section 2 we will give a short introduction to illocutionary logic and we will show which of the elements of illocutionary logic are important for modelling communication between agents in a formal normative system.
