Title: 1/21 Mudding: Social Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual Realities  
Author: Pavel Curtis 
Affiliation: Xerox PARC  
Abstract: A MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or, sometimes, Multi-User Dimension) is a network-accessible, multi-participant, user-extensible virtual reality whose user interface is entirely textual. Participants (usually called players) have the appearance of being situated in an artificially-constructed place that also contains those other players who are connected at the same time. Players can communicate easily with each other in real time. This virtual gathering place has many of the social attributes of other places, and many of the usual social mechanisms operate there. Certain attributes of this virtual place, however, tend to have significant effects on social phenomena, leading to new mechanisms and modes of behavior not usually seen IRL (in real life). In this paper, I relate my experiences and observations from having created and maintained a MUD for over a year.

E.M.

Reference-contexts: This protective anonymity also encourages some players to behave irresponsibly, rudely, or even obnoxiously. We have had instances of severe and repeated sexual harassment, crudity, and deliberate offensiveness. In general, such cruelty 3. Kiesler and her colleagues <ref> [2] </ref> have investigated the effects of this kind of electronic anonymity on the decision-making and problem-solving processes in organizations; some of their observations parallel mine given here. 10/21 Pavel Curtis Mudding: Social Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual Realities 3/3/92 seems to be supported by two causes: the offenders believe (usually correctly) that

Reference-contexts: While I can spare no more space for this topic, I enthusiastically encourage the interested reader to look up Van Gelders fascinating article <ref> [3] </ref> for many more examples and insights, as well as the story of a remarkably successful deception via electronic transvestism. The final part of a players self-presentation, and the only part involving prose, is the players description. <p> In McLuhans terminology <ref> [3] </ref>, this is because MUDs are a cold medium, while ore graphically-based media are hot; that is, the sensorial parsimony of plain text tends to entice users into engaging their imaginations to fill in missing details while, comparatively speaking, the richness of stimuli in fancy virtual realities has an opposite tendency,

Finally, there is Habitat <ref> [4] </ref>, a half-graphical, half textual virtual reality in Japan, with well over 10,000 users. I believe that text-based virtual realities and wide-area interactive chat facilities [6] are becoming more and more common and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

Reference-contexts: The typical MUD user interface is most reminiscent of old computer games like Adventure and Zork <ref> [5] </ref>; a typical interaction is shown in Figure 1. Three major factors distinguish a MUD from an Adventure-style computer game, though: A MUD is not goal-oriented; it has no beginning or end, no score, and no notion of winning or success.

Like CB radios and telephone party lines before them, MUDs seem to provide a necessary social outlet. The MUD model is also being extended in new ways for new audiences.
