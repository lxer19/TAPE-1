Abstract: Scalar functions of three variables, w = f(x; y; z), are common in many types of scientific and medical applications. Such 3D scalar fields can be understood as elevation maps in four dimensions, with three independent variables (x; y; z) and a fourth, dependent, variable w that corresponds to the elevations. We show how techniques developed originally for the display of 3-manifolds in 4D Euclidean space can be adapted to visualize 3D scalar fields in a variety of ways.

Reference-contexts: For volume data of the form w = f (x; y; z), extensive attention has been paid to the 3D analogs of 2D contour plots and pseudo-color maps: see, for example, various methods for constructing isosurfaces <ref> [11, 1] </ref>, viewing color-coded density data [14, 12, 6], making easily visible pseudo-color maps [13], and exploiting transport theory [10]. However, except for some exploratory efforts (see, e.g., [4, 9]), the analogs of elevation maps for 3D scalar fields have not been pursued to their logical completion. <p> Analogs of each of these depictions can be constructed for 3D scalar fields as well. For example, contour lines for 3D scalar fields are basically nested shells produced by an isosurface construction algorithm <ref> [11, 1] </ref>.

(PAW images <ref> [2] </ref>.) which has no occlusion, to a very oblique viewpoint Figure 2 (d), we see the hemisphere "rising out of the background," in a manner of speaking. The most oblique view has the most occlusion, and also shows the profile of the highest elevation points dramatically. <p> Finally, in (d) we see a very oblique view with extensive occlusion and a profile explicitly showing the elevation of the hemisphere above the background. (PAW images <ref> [2] </ref>.) lattice cube hides another in 4D. Figure 3 treats the small 4D cubes making up the grid volume as transparent in 4D, but opaque once projected to 3D; this makes the resulting image easier to interpret as a 3D structure.

Reference-contexts: The distortion of the grid squares in the oblique projection adds a third cue, as shown in Figure 6 (c). * Shaded Specular Surface. In Figure 6 (d), we assume a reflective surface, introduce 3D lighting, and use standard shading techniques <ref> [5] </ref> to create a shaded scene rendering.
