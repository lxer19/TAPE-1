Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 451 Draft of 1998 IVC Submission: edited version of FG'98 Abstract This paper describes a real-time, fully-dynamic, 3-D person tracking system that is able to tolerate full (temporary) occlusions and whose performance is substantially unaffected by the presence of multiple people. The framework provides a mathematically concise formulation for incorporating a wide variety of physical constraints and probabilistic influences. The framework takes the form of a recursive filter that enables pixel-level, probabilistic processes to take advantage of the contextual knowledge encoded in the higher-level models. Results are shown that demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative gains in tracking performance.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately there are other ways of making predictions about dynamic systems, including Kalman filters. Linear Kalman filters are computationally efficient, and, while Kalman filters also have a large number of parameters that must be chosen, there is a mature literature on the subject <ref> [1] </ref>. The update equation for the linear Kalman filter is the matrix form of the dynamic update equations above: 2 q t q t 5 = t1 4 _ q t1 3 where t1 is the system transition matrix. <p> The norm kP tjt1 k is used as a confidence metric by the observation model described in Section 2.2.1. P tjt1 is also used to update K t : K t = P tjt1 H T fi t R For a detailed derivation of these equations see Gelb <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes a real-time, fully-dynamic, 3-D person tracking system that is able to tolerate full (temporary) occlusions and whose performance is substantially unaffected by the presence of multiple people. The system is driven using 2-D blob features observed in two or more cameras <ref> [2, 22] </ref>. These features are then probabilistically integrated into a fully-dynamic 3-D skeletal model, which in turn drives the 2-D feature tracking process by providing 2-D projections of the 3-D model predicitions. <p> The reduction of degrees of freedom from individual pixels to blob parameters is a form of regularization which allows the ill-conditioned problem to be solved in a principled and stable way. These 2-D features are the input to the 3-D blob estimation formulation used by Azarbayejani and Pentland <ref> [2] </ref>. This relates the 2-D distribution of pixel values to a tracked object's 3-D position and orientation.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the first efforts in body tracking were by Badler and O'Rourke 1980 [15], followed by Hogg 1988 [14], and other variations on their basic method <ref> [20, 3] </ref>. With the exception of Badler, these early efforts employed 2-D kinematic models of the human body driven by edge information. Gavrila and Davis [8] and Rehg and Kanade [19] used 3-D kinematic models driven by edge data from multiple cameras in an analysis-synthesis framework.

Reference-contexts: For a large class of Kalman filters this analogy is exact, that is, the mathematics of integrating forces acting on a dynamic body is identical to the mathematics of observation integration within a Kalman filter <ref> [16, 13, 4] </ref>. Soft constraints have the additional advantage that they can also be used to model external influences on the dynamic system, such as gravity. Soft constraints such as these can be expressed as a potential field acting on the dynamic system.

Reference-contexts: Pentland and Horowitz 1991 employed non-rigid finite element models driven by optical flow [16], and Metaxas and Terzopolous's 1993 system employing deformable superquadrics [10, 13] driven by 3-D point and 2-D edge measurements. More recently Bregler <ref> [5] </ref> has combined dynamic techniques with 2-D, region-based features with good results. These systems all suffer from problems with self-occlusion. In general, they either rely on expensive search techniques to find consistent solutions or simply drop occluded body parts.

Reference-contexts: Our application is unusual, because the framework directly couples raw pixel measurements with an articulated, dynamic model of the human skeleton: no part of the system is blindly feed-forward. In this aspect our system is similar to that of Dickmanns in automobile control <ref> [6] </ref>, and we obtain similar advantages in efficiency and stability though this direct coupling. This paper will begin by describing our formulation for driving a 3-D skeletal model from 2-D probabilistic measurements, and then address the problem of incorporating feedback from the 3-D model to the 2-D feature finding process.

Reference-contexts: One example of a kinematic constraint is a skeletal joint. Lagrangian dynamics can be used to satisfy such hard constraints by choosing a state vector the describes only the degrees of freedom left to the system <ref> [7] </ref>. This requires that the constraints be solved analytically at model-building time. While this formulation is very efficient, it requires an analytical solution of the constraints to exist. It also precludes modification of the constraint structure at run-time. Our model instead follows the virtual work formulation [21].

Reference-contexts: With the exception of Badler, these early efforts employed 2-D kinematic models of the human body driven by edge information. Gavrila and Davis <ref> [8] </ref> and Rehg and Kanade [19] used 3-D kinematic models driven by edge data from multiple cameras in an analysis-synthesis framework. Both of these systems used the kinematic models to deal with limited occlusions, and thus could begin to handle a greater range of body motions.

Reference-contexts: This situation is exacerbated by the common use of the analysis-synthesis framework that forces early processing stages to make decisions without the benefit of context that is readily available in other parts of the system. Isard and Blake <ref> [9] </ref> call this the problem of ambiguous data. They suggest the Condensation method that avoids this search by using a probabilistic framework to carry a multitude of possible hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately it requires the propagation hundreds to thousands of hypotheses to track even a single hand, and thus remains very far from real-time for this problem. Recent work by Metaxas <ref> [11] </ref> comes close to breaking the barrier between ambiguous features and the context needed to resolve them by using dynamic predictions to drive a view-point selection algorithm, but the feature computation itself is a blind feed-forward process.
