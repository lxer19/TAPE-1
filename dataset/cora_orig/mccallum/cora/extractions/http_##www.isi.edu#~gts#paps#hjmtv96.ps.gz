Title: Robust and Secure Password and Key Change Method  
Author: Ralf Hauser Philippe Janson Refik Molva Gene Tsudik Els Van Herreweghen 
Date: November 1994.  
Note: Proceedings of European Symposium on Research in Computer Security,  
Abstract: This paper discusses the issues and idiosyncracies associated changing passwords and keys. Current approaches are aften too complicated and fail to provide the necessary level of security and fault tolerance. A novel and very simple approach to changing passwords/keys is presented and analyzed. It provides a means for human users and service programs to change passwords and keys in a robust and secure fashion.

Reference-contexts: explicitly constructed to handle anomalous behavior (i.e., events that can lead to cases 3-6 above) of the network and arbitrary failures of the components involved. 2 The Kerberos Approach One of the most popular network security solutions is provided by the Kerberos Authentication and Key Distribution Server originated at MIT <ref> [2] </ref>. Among its multitude of features, Kerberos includes a change password (CPW) protocol implemented by the kpasswd command which is part of standard Kerberos distribution package. The actual protocol varies slightly between successive versions of Kerberos. The CPW protocol for Kerberos versions 4 and 5, is illustrated in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: However, any kind of authenticated acknowledgment in response to an incorrect REQ CPW is out of the question. This is because doing so would require using the principal's current stored key which would present an opportunity for a known plaintext attack (the AS would be come an oracle, see <ref> [3] </ref>). Therefore, the mechanism on the user's side must at least provide for an error message which after a certain number of unanswered REQ CPW (timeout) checks for the general availability of the AS and suggests resorting to off-line means for re-synchronization. Obviously, the acknowledgment (REP CPW) must be protected.

Reference-contexts: The ticket expressions are similar to those used in the KryptoKnight Authentication and Key Distribution Service [7]. (See also <ref> [5, 6, 4] </ref>.) If the request is well-formed and authentic, AS replies with an authenticated acknowledgment REP CPW which can take on two flavors: ACK (accept) or NACK (reject). The AS generates a NACK if only if K new is not acceptable for some reason (e.g., predictable password).
