Abstract: Human figures have been animated using a wide variety of geometric models including stick figures, polygonal models, and NURBS-based models with muscles, flexible skin, or clothing. This paper reports on experiments designed to ascertain whether a viewer's perception of motion characteristics is affected by the geometric model used for rendering. Subjects were shown a series of paired motion sequences and asked if the two motions in each pair were "the same" or "different." The two motion sequences in each pair used the same geometric model. For each trial, the pairs of motion sequences were grouped into two sets where one set was rendered with a stick figure model and the other set was rendered with a polygonal model. Sensitivity measures for each trial indicate that for these sequences subjects were better able to discriminate motion variations with the polygonal model than with the stick figure model.

They also reported that the gender of unfamiliar walkers was readily identifiable, even after the number of lights had been reduced to just two located on the ankles [16].

Reference-contexts: In a modified experiment, subjects were shown light-dot displays of walkers facing either left or right, and asked to determine walking direction. Only very complex masks of extraneous light dots moving in patterns that were similar to those of the walking figure were able to disrupt the viewer's judgment <ref> [7] </ref>. Although human walking movements are accurately sensed from light-dot displays, synthetic human movements are easily accepted as human. Using measurements from light-dot displays, Cutting and colleagues [8] found that apparent torso structure and rotation were strongly correlated with judgments of walker gender.

The light-dot displays showed only dots or patches of light that moved with the main joints of walking figures (figure 2), but even these minimal cues were sufficient for viewers to make detailed assessments of both the motion and the nature of the fig 2 ure.

The vertical, or yaw, rotation of the torso at the waist was exaggerated. The neck was counter rotated to compensate for the torso rotation so that the facing direction of the head remained unchanged. The magnitude of the exaggeration in torso rotation was controlled by a normalized parameter, t.

Reference-contexts: These experimental observations suggest that extremely simple models of human figures, such as thin stick figures may present similar difficulties for the viewer. Surprisingly, the perception of rigid body segments between moving light dots at joints does not generalize to movements of isolated pairs of light dots. Ishiguchi <ref> [12] </ref> showed test subjects one fixed light dot and a second one that moved on an arc of 15 degrees as if it were on the end of a pendulum with the first light dot as the pivot joint.

This measure is zero when the subject's responses are uncorrelated with the correct responses (i.e. 50% correct) and increases as response correlation improves (figure 5).

Reference-contexts: Viewers easily identified the synthetic displays as human walkers and accurately determined the intended gender of the walkers. These experiments clearly showed that variations in torso rotation are important for gender judgments. Accordingly, we chose to measure viewer sensitivity to torso rotations in our experiments. Proffitt and his colleagues <ref> [24] </ref> found that occlusion of light dots by clothing or human body segments plays an important role in gait judgment and may also provide information about body outlines. Synthetic displays without occlusion yielded poorer subject performance.
