Title: Genetic Programming for Image Analysis

Abstract: This paper describes an approach to using GP for image analysis based on the idea that image enhancement, feature detection and image segmentation can be re-framed as image filtering problems. GP can be used to discover efficient optimal filters which solve such problems. However, in order to make the search feasible and effective, terminal sets, function sets and fitness functions have to meet some requirements. In the paper these requirements are described and terminals, functions and fitness functions that satisfy them are proposed. Some preliminary experiments are also reported in which GP (with the mentioned characteristics) is applied to the segmentation of the brain in magnetic resonance images (an extremely difficult problem for which no simple solution is known) and compared with artificial neural nets.

Reference-contexts: The search that GP has to do can be made considerably easier by using a wrapper for the filtering program, which simply sets the output to 1 if the filter's output is positive, to 0 otherwise. The second reason has to do with the sensitivity/specificity dilemma <ref> [8] </ref> that any segmentation or detection algorithm has to face: with real-world images no algorithm can detect/segment the points belonging to the structures of interest (True Positives, TPs) without wrongly detecting also some points which belong to uninteresting structures (False Positives, FPs) and missing some points (False Negatives, FNs).

Reference-contexts: The fitness function f = F P 2 +F N 2 tends to behave slightly better but still does not give acceptable results when the number of pixels to be detected is much smaller than the pixels in the image. 7 and connections have not been drawn). is basically impossible <ref> [9] </ref>. However, this does not mean that using large neighborhoods, the task becomes easy. To show this and also to provide a reference for comparison with GP, some experiments using neural networks in conjunction with medium- and large-size neighborhoods have been performed.
