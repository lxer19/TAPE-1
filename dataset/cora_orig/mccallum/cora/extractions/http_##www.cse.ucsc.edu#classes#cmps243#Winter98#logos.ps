Abstract: A graphical method is presented for displaying the patterns in a set of aligned sequences. The characters representing the sequence are stacked on top of each other for each position in the aligned sequences. The height of each letter is made proportional to its frequency, and the letters are sorted so the most common one is on top. The height of the entire stack is then adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position. From these `sequence logos', one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content (measured in bits) at every position in a site or sequence. The logo displays both significant residues and subtle sequence patterns. INTRODUCTION A logo is "a single piece of type bearing two or more usually separate elements" [1]. In this paper, we use logos to display aligned sets of sequences. Sequence logos concentrate the following information into a single graphic [2]:

Reference-contexts: CREATION OF BINDING SITE LOGOS To create a logo from a set of sequences, the sequences are first aligned relative to one another. For example, a set of ribosome binding sequences can be aligned at the translational initiation point <ref> [3] </ref>. A table of frequencies of each base at each position is then constructed. The frequency table is examined at each individual position and sorted by the frequency of bases.

Reference-contexts: The frequency table is examined at each individual position and sorted by the frequency of bases. The most frequent base, called the "consensus" base, appears on the top of the final graphic and is commonly used to represent the pattern of a sequence <ref> [4] </ref>. However, a consensus sequence does not represent all the information in the sequences since in many cases other bases also appear at a significant frequency. For example, the procaryotic initiation codon, which is predominantly AUG, also has GUG and UUG on occasion. <p> We thank Morton Schultz, Peter Lemkin, Denise Rubens, Michael Yarmolinsky, Peter Rogan, Jeffrey Strathern, Doug Halverson, and Hugo Martinez for their comments on the manuscript, Joseph Mack for supplying the aligned globin sequences, Eric Miller for pointing out the graphical technique devised by Reznikoff and McClure <ref> [4] </ref> and the members of the Advanced Scientific Computing Laboratory for their technical support.

Reference-contexts: For example, the procaryotic initiation codon, which is predominantly AUG, also has GUG and UUG on occasion. If one ignores these possibilities, one has distorted the data. This is one of several reasons why the consensus sequence is a poor model for binding sites <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. The importance of a particular position in a binding site is more clearly and consistently given by the information required to describe the pattern there [7, 8].

Relative letter sizes probably only have meaning in the column they reside in, although we note the curious consistency in height of the pyrimidines below the Shine and Dalgarno purines <ref> [19] </ref> in Figure 1. A similar effect is observed for the purines (Fig 1 below the pyrimidine tract at the 3 0 ends of introns (in preparation).
