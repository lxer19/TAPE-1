Abstract: Even an "elementary" intelligence for control of the physical world will require very many kinds of knowledge and ability. Among these are ones related to perception, action, and reasoning about "near space": that region comprising one's body and the portion of space within reach of one's effectors; chief among these are individuation and categorization of objects. These in turn are made useful in part by the additional capacities to estimate category size, change one's beliefs about categories, and form new categories or revise old categories. In this position paper we point out some issues in knowledge representation that can arise with respect to the above capacities, and suggest that the framework of "active logics" (see below) may be marshaled toward solutions. We will conduct our discussion in terms of learning to understand in a semantically explicit way one's own sensori-motor system and its interactions Note: this paper has been accepted for presentation at the 1994 AAAI Fall Symposium on Control of the Physical World by Intelligent Agents. with near-space objects.

Reference-contexts: properly individuate, count, and keep track of those objects in an internal language 4. classify those objects into appropriate categories 5. reason about those categories, e.g., count or estimate sizes, form and apply defaults, etc. 6. revise categories and category membership as needed 3 Discussion Some of our previous work <ref> [3, 2, 6, 10, 8, 14, 11] </ref> treated rather disjointed aspects of this long-range problem. In this position paper we simply single out four key aspects of the more integrative long-range task: calibration, counting, grounding, and grouping.

Reference-contexts: its own bodily measurements, in an internal self-model. (This also bears on the so-called active-vision paradigm, which maintains that the intentions and actions of the seeing agent are critical to its visual computations.) It is of interest that although categorization (grouping) has received a great deal of attention by psychologists <ref> [4] </ref>, little study has been made on the human use of categories to advance default inferences.

Reference-contexts: The portion of the meta-reasoning that we have been working on to date includes representational tools for change in belief and for recovery from contradictory beliefs. Others to be worked on include change in category; magnitudes (cardinal and ordinal counting and measurement); sets <ref> [13, 12] </ref> (as convenient representations for both categories and counting); and rule-learning (automatization of explicit beliefs about actions). Category discrimination in itself may be largely perceptual and is not the direct focus of our concern here. Rather, our topic is the reasoning about categories that one can discriminate.

Reference-contexts: Some aspects of the larger task are not ones we intend to address, especially those bearing most directly on basic perceptual or motor skills (vision and robotics). We also are not explicitly concerned with qualitative physics in the usual sense <ref> [16] </ref>, but rather principally with an agent's 3 self-models as they incorporate information about dealing with near space. Self-models and near space are what we are now beginning to focus on in some of our current research.
