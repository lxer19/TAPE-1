Abstract: Our goal is to construct large-scale lexicons for interlingual MT of English, Arabic, Korean, and Spanish. We describe techniques that predict salient linguistic features of a non-English word using the features of its English gloss (i.e., translation) in a bilingual dictionary. While not exact, owing to inexact glosses and language-to-language variations, these techniques can augment an existing dictionary with reasonable accuracy, thus saving significant time. We have conducted two experiments that demonstrate the value of these techniques. The first tested the feasibility of building a database of thematic grids for over 6500 Arabic verbs based on a mapping between English glosses and the syntactic codes in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978). We show that it is more efficient and less error-prone to hand-verify the automatically constructed grids than it would be to build the thematic grids by hand from scratch. The second experiment tested the automatic classification of verbs into a richer semantic typology based on (Levin, 1993), from which we can derive a more refined set of thematic grids. In this second experiment, we show that a brute-force, non-robust technique provides 72% accuracy for semantic classification of LDOCE verbs; we then show that it is possible to approach this yield with a more robust technique based on fine-tuned statistical correlations. We further suggest the possibility of raising this yield by taking into account linguistic factors such as polysemy and positive and negative constraints on the syntax-semantics relation. We conclude that, while human intervention will always be necessary for the construction of a semantic classification from LDOCE, such intervention is significantly minimized as more knowledge about the syntax-semantics relation is introduced.

Reference-contexts: These points will be discussed briefly in Section 4 and are addressed more thoroughly in <ref> (Dorr and Jones, 1995) </ref>. The optimal value for each L (classjcodes) was defined on the basis of a frequency count on occurrences of LDOCE-based code patterns (abbreviated "codes") in the Levin-based classes (abbreviated "class"). <p> Table 10 provides a very small sample of the enhanced codes (37 out of 174) with their corresponding argument structures and example of verbs from (Levin, 1993); for the expanded version of this table, see <ref> (Dorr and Jones, 1995) </ref>. Table 11 shows the result of this experiment for 31 out of 925 unique LDOCE code patterns (under the column labeled Pattern). The top 5 Levin-based semantic classes for each pattern are given under the column labeled Levin Classes. <p> In particular, we are currently investigating an approach that takes into account linguistic factors such as polysemy and positive and negative constraints on the syntax-semantics relation <ref> (Dorr and Jones, 1995) </ref>. Polysemy is a problem in our current algorithm because we have assigned a single code pattern to each English verb, even in cases where a subset of the codes in a pattern corresponds to more than one verb meaning. <p> This correlation can be exploited in for more accurate prediction of membership or non-membership in a semantic class. An abbreviated list of possible correlations between Levin's alternations and LDOCE code pairs is given in Table 15. 20 The full set of correlations that we have discovered is presented in <ref> (Dorr and Jones, 1995) </ref>. The significance of this finding is that, with a comprehensive list, it is possible to impose not only positive constraints (which are the only type used in previous 94 B. DORR, J. GARMAN, AND A.

Reference-contexts: The results of manual checking for accuracy are also presented. Section 3 describes the second experiment, i.e., our improvements on the automatic acquisition approach used in the first experiment. This experiment involved the use of verb classes from <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> in conjunction with the subcategorization codes in LDOCE. Section 4 discusses the implications of these experiments and examines the possibility of obtaining better results by taking into account linguistic factors such as polysemy and positive and negative constraints on the syntax-semantics relation. 2. <p> Thus, our next step was to define thematic grids on the basis of a finer-grained verbal classification along the lines of <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. This approach has a better chance of capturing subtle meaning distinctions while still supporting an interlingual MT framework. We have built an alternative set of thematic grids that are richer than the ones described above as well as more language-independent. <p> For example, the semantic class 29.2 in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> ("Characterize Verbs") is associated FROM SYNTACTIC ENCODINGS TO THEMATIC ROLES 83 with the thematic grid `exp perc instr (as)'. 16 By language-independent, we refer to more syntactically neutral thematic specifications such as `exp' (experiencer) and `perc' (perceived entity) rather than `event+ed'. <p> Our intent is to "port" these hand-coded thematic grids into the Alpnet dictionary using the same technique described above, thus replacing the LDOCE-based thematic grids with the richer version. Of the 6587 unique English glosses in the Arabic dictionary, we found 3298 in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>; thus, we achieved about 50% overlap with the verbs in the entire Arabic dictionary. 18 Of the 3289 missing glosses, it is interesting to note that 1710 are of the form "be X," 161 are of the form "become X," 65 are of the form "have X," and 1353 <p> As seen by these numbers and the regular structure of these gloss patterns, the mapping from Alpnet glosses to Levin's verbs is a potentially productive process. Random examples of verbs not found in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> are shown in Figure 3. This section describes an experiment that will ultimately lead to the incorporation of an enriched set of thematic grids into the Alpnet lexicon using a combination of LDOCE codes and the verb classes in (Levin, 1993). <p> Random examples of verbs not found in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> are shown in Figure 3. This section describes an experiment that will ultimately lead to the incorporation of an enriched set of thematic grids into the Alpnet lexicon using a combination of LDOCE codes and the verb classes in (Levin, 1993). The experiment presented below tests the hypothesis that there exists a correspondence between code combinations from the LDOCE and Levin's semantic classes. <p> We show that the presence of certain code patterns allowed us to determine, automatically, the semantic classification of 72% of all verbs in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> using a brute-force, non-robust technique. We then demonstrate that it is possible to approach this yield with a more robust technique based on fine-tuned statistical correlations. 3.1. <p> We started by examining LDOCE-coded verbs that occur in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. For each such verb, we determined the probability that the verb (with its associated LDOCE codes) belonged to a given Levin-based class. <p> No regard was given to anything else other than achieving a maximally correct verb classification with respect to <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> using the LDOCE coding scheme. In particular, we did not attempt to take different word senses into account, nor did we use linguistic constraints that might be derived from a closer examination of the relation between syntactic codes and semantic FROM SYNTACTIC ENCODINGS TO THEMATIC ROLES 85 classes. <p> Table 10 provides a very small sample of the enhanced codes (37 out of 174) with their corresponding argument structures and example of verbs from <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>; for the expanded version of this table, see (Dorr and Jones, 1995). Table 11 shows the result of this experiment for 31 out of 925 unique LDOCE code patterns (under the column labeled Pattern). <p> Likewise, the best second choice is also chosen, and so on. 3.2. Results of Brute-Force Classification Strategy We evaluated the classification strategy given above on the 3828 Levin entries. (The intent, then, is to compare the results with the actual classification given in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>.) The number of entries correctly classified is shown in Table 12. Of the 3828 entries, 2659 (69.5%) were correctly classified in one of the 5 best classes. <p> However, we must consider whether the method is useful for the acquisition of novel verbs, i.e., those not occurring in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. In particular, as mentioned in the previous section, over half (464) of the 925 unique LDOCE patterns occurred only once. One might wonder how many additional unique LDOCE patterns exist (outside of the ones corresponding to Levin's verbs) and what we should do when such patterns are encountered. <p> This investigation has led to the development of a robust technique that applies to new LDOCE code patterns as they are encountered. With this approach we were able to achieve 55% accuracy of semantic classification (automatically checked against the verbs occurring in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>). The approach is not to analyze LDOCE codes in terms of a correspondence between code patterns and semantic classes, but rather as a correspondence between individual codes and semantic classes. <p> A bimodal distribution is assumed in the calculation of P (njcode,class). As an example, consider the class 9.1 in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> ("Put Verbs"). This class has 12 entries. 7 of these entries contain the `X9' code. If `X9' had been randomly distributed to this class, we would expect to find 1 occurrence of it. <p> A subset of the raw results of this experiment is shown in Table 13. Correctly predicted classes are marked with a plus (+). Table 14 shows a comparison of the results of this experiment with the actual classification given in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. Of the 3828 entries, 1807 (~47%) were correctly classified in one of the 5 best classes. Of the 2775 verbs, 1527 (55.0%) had at least one class correctly chosen. <p> This implies that the LDOCE codes do not provide enough information to cover all of the combinations of syntactic behaviors required for distinguishing between the semantic classes in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. <p> The resulting entries were shown to be highly accurate and the process of checking has proven to be more efficient than manual entry from scratch. We have further experimented with methods that combined LDOCE codes with Levin's verb classes <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>, demonstrating that it is possible to arrive at a more enriched semantic classification of verbs. <p> We are currently augmenting the Arabic lexicon to include lexical-semantic representations with verbal entries. This will be achieved by associating lexical-semantic templates with semantic classes in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> and installing the resulting forms in the corresponding lexical entries for Arabic. The cross-linguistic applicability of the techniques described in this paper has been demonstrated in our current work on lexicon construction for Arabic, Spanish, FROM SYNTACTIC ENCODINGS TO THEMATIC ROLES 97 and Korean.

Reference-contexts: Our working assumption is that thematic-grid information can be correlated with patterns of grammar codes in the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) <ref> (Procter, 1978) </ref>. While grammar codes have been used previously in automatic extraction tasks (see, e.g., Boguraev and Briscoe (1989); Wilks et al. (1990)), the codes have been used primarily for the prediction of syntactic phrase structure, not for assigning thematic roles that are then used later for semantic analysis.
