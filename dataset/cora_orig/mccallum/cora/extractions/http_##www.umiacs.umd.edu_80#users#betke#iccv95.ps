Abstract: A fast simulated annealing algorithm is developed for automatic object recognition. The object recognition problem is addressed as the problem of best describing a match between a hypothesized object and an image. The normalized correlation coefficient is used as a measure of the match. Templates are generated on-line during the search by transforming model images. Simulated annealing reduces the search time by orders of magnitude with respect to an exhaustive search. The algorithm is applied to the problem of how landmarks, e.g., traffic signs, can be recognized by a navigating robot. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm with real-world images of complicated scenes with traffic signs. False positive matches occur only for templates with very small information content. To avoid false positive matches, we propose a method to select model images for robust object recognition by measuring the information content of the model images. The algorithm works well in noisy images for model images with high information content.

Reference-contexts: Using the correlation as a measure of successful recognition is also advantageous because it is a very robust measure. That is, it is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in the environment compared to higher resolution methods, as is well documented in spectral, bearing, and range estimation problems <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. 3 Generating Templates from Model Images A template T (x; y) is generated from a model image M (x; y) by choosing three parameters that describe a transformation from M into T . <p> If the correlation coefficient r j increases over the previous coefficient r j1 , the new parameter values are accepted in the j-th iteration (as in the gradient method). Otherwise, they are accepted if where ~ is randomly chosen to be in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, T j is the temperature parameter, and E j = 1 r j is the cost function in the j-th iteration. For a sufficient temperature this allows "jumps" out of local minima.

Reference-contexts: Automatically recognizing traffic signs in images is very valuable for mobile robot or autonomous vehicle navigation. A robot that can recognize a traffic sign as a familiar landmark in its map of the environment can then use this information to localize itself in its environment <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For the more general problem of recogniz bottom: European no-entry sign matches car roof. ing which object is in a scene image (i.e., not knowing the kind of traffic sign a priori), we ran 144 experiments with 18 scene images and 8 model images <ref> [3] </ref>. Table 1 contains some of the correlation values obtained in the experiments. For each scene image, our algorithm computes the highest correlation coefficient among the set of values obtained for each model (boldface values in Table 1).

Reference-contexts: For future work, severe illumination variations within the object and occlusion problems can be addressed. Other applications of our method, for example in medical computer vision and in face recognition, are being investigated. We believe that with our method we can generalize common approaches to recognize faces <ref> [4] </ref> by using images that are not normalized but contain more general scenes with varied backgrounds.

Reference-contexts: The optimization technique fast simulated annealing is applied to avoid the cost of brute-force search by directing the search successfully. It reduces the search time by orders of magnitude. Recent publications in the sonar literature <ref> [5, 11] </ref> show that fast simulated annealing has been very successful in coherent signal extraction and localization in noisy environments. We use it in a similar way for incoherent image processing. Kirkpatrick et al. [10] show how to simulate annealing of combinatorial optimization problems. <p> Therefore, at a specific temperature we do not combine the test for the choice of the location, sampling, and rotation angle. We also obtain good results using simulated annealing only for the location parameters, and a gradient descent with large enough random perturbations <ref> [5] </ref> for the remaining parameters.

Reference-contexts: Our method stands apart from previous approaches to traffic sign recognition because first, it is efficiently applied to real-world landscape images (as opposed to Ettinger's isolated signs <ref> [6] </ref>), and second, it does not rely on color perception which is very sensitive to lighting changes (as opposed to the approach of Zheng et al. [19]). The optimization technique fast simulated annealing is applied to avoid the cost of brute-force search by directing the search successfully.

Reference-contexts: Szu and Hartley [17] propose an inverse linear cooling schedule for simulated annealing. This version is called "fast simulated annealing." The original slower version of simulated annealing has been applied to segmentation and noise reduction of degraded images <ref> [7] </ref>. However, for visual object recognition, fast simulated annealing has yet not been exploited. This paper is organized in the following way: The object recognition problem is defined as a parameter search problem in Section 2. Section 3 shows how templates are generated from model images. <p> Note that the rate at which the temperature decreases is inverse linear [11, 17] and converges faster than an often used logarithmically inverse cooling schedule <ref> [7] </ref>. As a criteria for stopping the annealing process, we simply put a limit on the search length L.

An algorithm that randomly perturbs all parameters at the same time has poor convergence properties. Therefore, at a specific temperature we do not combine the test for the choice of the location, sampling, and rotation angle.

Reference-contexts: It can be used as a measure of the information content of the model image. (The relationship between resolution bounds, information content and object recognition for the physically realistic case of images with signal dependent noise is given in Ref. <ref> [13] </ref>). We examine the information content of each model image to evaluate how useful the model image is for the recognition task. All our model images M (x; y) have the same number of pixels n.

Reference-contexts: For large samples of p T pixels the error between the sampled correlation coefficient r and its continuous version can be expressed as the mean squared error E [(r ) 2 ] = p (see Weatherburn <ref> [18] </ref>). Therefore, false matches can be avoided if the template images do not get too small. The normalized auto-correlation of model image M (x; y) is P P P P algorithm. The sign is found after about 300 iterations (ca. 15 s).
