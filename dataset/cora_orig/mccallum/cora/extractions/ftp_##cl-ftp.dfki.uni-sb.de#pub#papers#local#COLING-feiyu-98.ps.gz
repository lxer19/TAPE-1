Title: Constraints over Lambda-Structures in Semantic Underspecification  
Author: Markus Egg and Joachim Niehren and Peter Ruhrberg and Feiyu Xu 
Address: Saarbrucken, Germany  
Affiliation: Department of Computational Linguistics Programming Systems Lab Universitat des Saarlandes,  
Abstract: We introduce a first-order language for semantic underspecification that we call Constraint Language for Lambda-Structures (CLLS). A - structure can be considered as a -term up to consistent renaming of bound variables (ff-equality); a constraint of CLLS is an underspec-ified description of a -structure. CLLS solves a capturing problem omnipresent in underspec-ified scope representations. CLLS features constraints for dominance, lambda binding, parallelism, and anaphoric links. Based on CLLS we present a simple, integrated, and underspecified treatment of scope, parallelism, and anaphora.

Reference-contexts: We propose a first-order constraint language for -structures called CLLS which solves the capturing problem of underspecified scope representations in a simple and elegant way. CLLS subsumes dominance constraints <ref> (Backofen et al., 1995) </ref> as known from syntactic processing (Marcus et al., 1983) with tree-adjoining grammars (Vijay-Shanker, 1992; Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 1994). Most importantly, CLLS constraints can describe the binding relation of a - structure in an underspecified manner (in contrast to -structures like (5), which are always fully specified).

Reference-contexts: CLLS is sufficiently expressive for an integrated treatment of semantic underspecification, parallelism, and anaphora. To this purpose it provides parallelism constraints (Niehren and Koller, 1998) of the form X=X 0 ~Y =Y 0 reminiscent to equality up-to constraints <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997a) </ref>, and anaphoric bindings constraints of the form ante (X)=X 0 . As proved in (Niehren and Koller, 1998), CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (Niehren et al., 1997a). <p> it provides parallelism constraints (Niehren and Koller, 1998) of the form X=X 0 ~Y =Y 0 reminiscent to equality up-to constraints <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997a) </ref>, and anaphoric bindings constraints of the form ante (X)=X 0 . As proved in (Niehren and Koller, 1998), CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (Niehren et al., 1997a). It also extends its linguistic coverage (Niehren et al., 1997b) by integrating an analysis of VP ellipses with anaphora as in (Kehler, 1995). Thus, the coverage of CLLS is comparable to Crouch (1995) and Shieber et al. (1996). <p> We hope that some of the more ad hoc features of our definition of parallelism (e.g. axiom 5) may receive a justification or improvement in the light of such a deeper understanding. Context Unification. CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (CU) <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997a) </ref>, but it leads to a more direct and more structured encoding of semantic constraints than CU could offer. There are three main differences between CU and CLLS. 1) In CLLS variables are interpreted over nodes rather than whole trees.

Reference-contexts: As proved in (Niehren and Koller, 1998), CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (Niehren et al., 1997a). It also extends its linguistic coverage <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997b) </ref> by integrating an analysis of VP ellipses with anaphora as in (Kehler, 1995). Thus, the coverage of CLLS is comparable to Crouch (1995) and Shieber et al. (1996). <p> In this case the parallel elements are the two subject NPs. (11) and (13) together give us a `Hirschbuhler sentence' (Hirschbuhler, 1982), and our treatment in this case is descriptively equivalent to that of <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997b) </ref>. Our parallelism constraints and their equality up-to constraints have been shown to be (non-trivially) intertranslatable (Niehren and Koller, 1998) if binding and linking relations in -structures are ignored. <p> The constraint for (8), displayed in (18), is an underspecified representation of the above three readings. It can be derived in a compositional fashion along the lines described in <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997b) </ref>. X s and X t represent the semantics of the source and the target clause, while X 16 and X 21 stand for the semantics of the parallel elements (Mary and Sue) respectively. <p> This gives us a direct handle on occurrences of semantic material, where CU could handle occurrences only indirectly and less efficiently. 2) CLLS avoids the capturing problem. 3) CLLS provides explicit anaphoric links, which could not be adequately modeled in CU. The insights of the CU-analysis in <ref> (Niehren et al., 1997b) </ref> carry over to CLLS, but the awkward second-order equations for expressing dominance in CU can be omitted (Niehren and Koller, 1998). This omission yields an enormous simplification and efficiency gain for processing. Tractability.
