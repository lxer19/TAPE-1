Abstract: Without widely deployed mechanisms for resource reservation, adaptive, best-effort techniques are the only methods of congestion control available to interactive, real-time applications. Here we discuss media scaling techniques for the audio component of videoconferencing systems and describe an experimental version of the ProShare system that incorporates two of these techniques. We also report the results of experiments using these techniques to adapt to daytime Internet traffic conditions.

Reference-contexts: Another strategy for congestion control is adaptive media scaling. This approach adjusts the attributes of the transmitted media streams to the current network conditions <ref> [1, 3, 4, 6, 8] </ref>, for example, reducing the video frame rate in response to packet loss. This approach is wellsuited to networks containing best-effort components, as well as the presumably more affordable best-effort service classes of most proposed resource reservation schemes.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the success of distributed real-time multimedia applications hinges on a successful method of congestion control. One strategy for congestion control for real-time multimedia traffic is resource reservation.

Reference-contexts: Two-dimensional scaling schemes were proposed and shown to be effective in campus-size internetworks in [8, 9]. Further work incorporating a two-dimensional scaling scheme into an experimental version of the Intel ProShare video-conferencing system also showed some benefit using a lower bit-rate codec over longer, Internet paths <ref> [7] </ref>. The system described here focused specifically on audio adaptation which was not part of this previous ProShare implementation. It is well known that the quality of the audio stream of a videoconference is the single largest factor in user perception of overall conference quality.
