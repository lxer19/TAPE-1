Abstract: Our concern is building the set G of maximally general terms covering positive examples and rejecting negative examples in propositional logic. Negative examples are represented as constraints on the search space. This representation allows for defining a partial order on the negative examples and on attributes too. It is shown that only minimal negative examples and minimal attributes are to be considered when building the set G. These results hold in case of a non-convergent data set. Constraints can be directly used for a polynomial characterization of G.

This shows that a nearest-miss is not necessarily a near-miss: Ce 2 is discriminated from Ex by more than one attribute. 2.4 Pruning negative examples Given the above definition, a result parallel to that of [SmRo90] holds : bottom-up learning only needs positive examples and nearest-miss negative examples.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding selector [Mich83] rejecting Ce 1 thus is : [Color = High]. The disjunction of the most general selectors covering Ex and rejecting Ce 1 is : [N ame = Knight] _ [Color = High] _ <ref> [N b Questions = [0; 6] </ref>] This disjunction can be thought of as a constraint upon the generalization of Ex : any term in the solution space must satisfy this logical constraint. <p> The corresponding selector [Mich83] rejecting Ce 1 thus is : [Color = High].
