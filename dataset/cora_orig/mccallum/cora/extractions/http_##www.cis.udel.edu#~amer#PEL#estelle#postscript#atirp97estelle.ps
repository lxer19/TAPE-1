Abstract: This paper describes the Estelle specification of MIL-STD 188-220A [7] Intranet Layer as well as a methodology for generating test sequences for checking the conformance of a protocol implementation to its specification. The methodology for deriving test cases from Estelle specification, which serves as input to test generation techniques, is presented. A Chinese postman tour [1] is used to determine a minimum-cost tour of the transition graph for various transition types. Finally, the paper discusses several controllability and optimization issues that need to be addressed in test cases generation for intranet and datalink layers of MIL-STD 188-220A.

Reference-contexts: Each transition has a corresponding cost (e.g., transitions that involve heavy computations and take longer are assigned higher cost). The test method that we then use is a Chinese Postman Tour that includes all valid transitions <ref> [1] </ref>. The method was developed at AT&T Bell Labs and applied successfully to testing various other communications protocols including ISDN switches, PBXs and terminals. The method produces a minimum-cost transition tour that starts and ends in the initial state, and that includes each valid transition at least once.

Reference-contexts: Outputs are generated by applying a set of externally controllable inputs. A black-box model for a protocol is represented as a pure finite-state machine (Pure FSM) <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.2 Transition types and testing order For testing purposes, transitions in EFSM are did-vided into three groups: * valid transitions: defined for the "normal" (or expected) behavior of the tested entity; * inopportune transitions: inputs are semantically and syntactically correct, but arrive unex pectedly (or out of sequence) in a

Reference-contexts: To ensure that the 188-220A standard is free from ambiguities which might cause implementation problems, we used Estelle to create an unambiguous 1 specification of the Data Link Layer as specified in the 27Jul95 version of the standard <ref> [3] </ref>. This specification effort was divided into three subprojects specifying: Type 1: Connectionless (CL) Operation (unack'ed and coupled ack'ed); Type 2 Connection-mode Operation, and Type 4: Decoupled Ack'ed Connectionless Operation. <p> For the more detailed description of the semantics of Estelle specification components (communication channels, interactions, etc), the interested reader may consult our paper on Datalink Layer specification <ref> [3] </ref>. We instead present a brief overview of Network Layer architecture with a focus on the Topology Update function of the Intranet layer. Figures 1 and 2 show the interface and general architecture of the Network Layer, which consists of Internet (IP) Layer, Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Function, and Intranet Layer.

Reference-contexts: In practice, testers may not have direct access to the interface (s) between the lower/upper tester and an IUT. There are three other testing frameworks that address this issue <ref> [4] </ref>. Based on the feedback that we got from CE-COM's 188-220A's Conformance Tester developers, we concluded that an explicit upper tester is unlikely to exist in the testing framework. This may make transitions that are fired by inputs coming from upper layers untestable.

Reference-contexts: In 1989, Es-telle was approved as one of two ISO International Standard Formal Description Techniques (FDT) for the specification of computer communication protocols <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Based on communicating extended finite state machines, Estelle has a formal, mathematical, implementation-independent semantics.
