Abstract: The requirement for dense interconnect in artificial neural network systems has led researchers to seek high-density interconnect technologies. This paper reports an implementation using multi-chip modules (MCMs) as the interconnect medium. The specific system described is a self-organizing, parallel, and dynamic learning model which requires a dense interconnect technology for effective implementation; this requirement is fulfilled by exploiting MCM technology. The ideas presented in this paper regarding an MCM implementation of artificial neural networks are versatile and can be adapted to apply to other neural network and connectionist models.

Reference-contexts: This requirement for dense interconnect in artificial neural network systems has led researchers to seek high-density interconnect technologies <ref> [1, 3, 14] </ref>. This paper reports an implementation of a connectionist model using a multi-chip module (MCM) as the interconnect medium. In this sense, a connectionist model refers to a system composed of fairly simple processing elements which are densely interconnected; artificial neural networks constitute a subset of connectionist systems. <p> Due to this last constraint, WSI has proven to be primarily useful in applications where a large number of identical or similar ICs are required. Many connectionist systems, such as neural networks, fall into this category <ref> [1, 3, 5, 14] </ref>. However, as will be explained later, some connectionist models may benefit from the ability to use different types of ICs in a hardware implementation. A printed circuit board is another approach that can be used to implement neural networks.

Reference-contexts: For this case, the number of connections is O (N 2 ), which shows that present neural models could potentially require huge amounts of interconnections. This observation has additional significance when practical implementations of neural networks are con sidered. A DARPA study <ref> [2] </ref> has reported character-istics and requirements of various neural network applications. These proposals include radar pulse identification, robot arm movement, isolated word recognition, low-level vision, and risk evaluation. The number of neurons ranges from 312 to 64,000, and the number of synapses ranges from 3,600 to approximately 4,000,000.

Reference-contexts: In an MCM, unpackaged ICs are mounted on a substrate which contains multiple layers of interconnect. The ICs are mounted to the substrate and electrically connected (by wire-bonding or other methods) to the substrate <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Multi-chip module packaging technology is an important technique which results in high chip density, small interchip propagation delay, low power consumption, and high interconnect density. <p> A four-layer thin film MCM process may have a maximum interconnection density as high as 300-800 linear centimeters of interconnections per square centimeters of die area (cm/sq. cm) <ref> [4, page 97] </ref>. In addition, as will be explained in Section 3.3, an MCM can accommodate many different types of ICs, such as logic, memory, analog, etc. For these reasons, an MCM approach was taken for the system implementation described in this paper. <p> One estimate of the interconnect density of a 20-layer PCB is about 140-260 cm/sq. cm <ref> [4, page 97] </ref>, which is substantially lower than the density that can be obtained using MCMs.

The result is a very dense collection of ICs and interconnect which can be packaged as a single unit <ref> [5] </ref>. As with MCMs, this technique re-sults in high chip density, small interchip propagation delay, low power consumption, and high interconnect density, typically somewhat higher than the interconnect density that can be obtained with MCMs. <p> Due to this last constraint, WSI has proven to be primarily useful in applications where a large number of identical or similar ICs are required.

Reference-contexts: This ability is due, in part, to their densely interconnected parallel architecture. However, often neural networks are simulated on sequential computers and lose much of their potential speed capability, since this inherent parallelism is lost <ref> [11] </ref>. Hardware implementations of neural networks offer a solution to this drawback but also present several challenges. One particular challenge to the development of neural network hardware implementations is the typically high interconnect density that these implementations require. <p> One particular challenge to the development of neural network hardware implementations is the typically high interconnect density that these implementations require. The required density can be appreciated by considering the equations that govern the dynamics of neural network models. Ramacher and Schurmann <ref> [11] </ref> have shown that the operation of most neural network models can be summarized by three general equations, the first of which is presented here without derivation. <p> Specifically, y 1;p is the neuron's individual input, W i;0 is the neuron's individual threshold, and W i;1 = y 0;p = 1: The other general equations reported in <ref> [11] </ref> are not presented here. Briefly, they represent the changes in the values of the weights between neurons and the updated values of these weights. These general equations can be used to estimate the general hardware requirements of neural networks.

This system differs significantly from many other commercially avail able neural network systems and research projects, since MCMs are used as the interconnect medium.

Reference-contexts: This is one of the requirements that makes a multi-chip module implementation advantageous. 3.2 Hardware implementation and test ing procedures Each IC described in Section 3.1 contains the functional hardware for one node of a PASOCS. Details of these ICs can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>. For this study, four packaged ICs and four unpackaged ICs were fabricated. First, the individually packaged ICs were tested and compared to the simulation results obtained during the initial design. Then, three of the packaged ICs were connected on a PCB as a three-node PASOCS and tested. <p> It should be noted that these are problems with the specific implementation of the ICs and not with the functionality of the PASOCS model or with the original conceptual design of the ICs as shown in <ref> [13] </ref>. 3.3 Important characteristics of an MCM approach MCM technology has important characteristics that make it an attractive option for implementing connectionist systems. Some of these, which have already been mentioned in Section 2.1, include high chip density, small interchip propagation delay, low power consumption, and high interconnect density.
