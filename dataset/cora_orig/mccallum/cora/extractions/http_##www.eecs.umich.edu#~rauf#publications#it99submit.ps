Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role of the receive filter and the branch metric in decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE) and M-algorithm receivers. We consider a generalized receiver which consists of a front-end filter (matched to the overall channel response or the transmit filter response) followed by a general transversal processing filter and a reduced trellis or tree search algorithm. A first event error analysis of the generalized receiver indicates that a proper combination of the processing filter and the branch metric is necessary to avoid bias (untreated interference components) in the receiver. Bias occurs in a DFSE or M-algorithm receiver due to a mismatch between the processing filter and the branch metric. We show that the processing filter must either be the appropriate noise-whitening filter or the zero-forcing filter in order to achieve unbiasedness. We obtain the branch metric for the reduced trellis and tree search algorithms for each case of matched filtering. The well-known DFSE and M-algorithm receivers where the search algorithm operates on whitened statistics belong to the class of unbiased receivers, while the receivers where the search algorithm operates on standard matched filter statistics belong to the class of biased receivers. We characterize the error performance of various DFSE and truncated memory MLSE receivers in terms of a parameter called the error distance which includes the effect of noise enhancement. We show that the whitening filter DFSE receiver is optimum among unbiased DFSE and truncated memory MLSE receivers (with pre-filtering) in the sense that it maximizes the error distance. We

In the case of an unbiased DFSE receiver, the minimum error distance squared per noise spectral density can be considered as its effective SNR <ref> [6] </ref>. For a given channel and memory order, the distance of a given error sequence depends on the type of the DFSE receiver. Specifically, it depends on the receive 30 filter and the branch metric. In this section, we compare the error distance for various receivers. <p> Here, we describe a generating function method for unbiased DFSE receivers. Note that a generating function method has never been considered for WF-DFSE receivers. In [8] and <ref> [6] </ref>, the minimum distance was used to approximate the symbol error probability. However, the approximation may not be very good depending on the system, even at high SNRs [21].

Reference-contexts: As the complexity of the various MLSE algorithms is exponential in the channel memory, several low-complexity suboptimal methods have been proposed. One method is to ignore the tail of the delay response or to select a subset of states in the Viterbi algorithm for reduced state detection <ref> [24, 12] </ref>. The residual interference that arises as a result limits the performance of these methods even at modest ISI levels [18]. Another approach is to pre-cancel the tail of the delay response using a linear or a decision feedback equalizer (DFE).

Reference-contexts: The whitening filter DFSE (WF-DFSE) and whitening filter M-algorithm (WF-MA) receivers with a standard matched filter are the well-known receivers described in [6, 8, 21, 1, 26]. The zero-forcing DFSE (ZF-DFSE) receiver with a standard matched filter was derived in <ref> [20] </ref>. The class of biased receivers includes matched filter DFSE (MF-DFSE) and matched filter M-algorithm (MF-MA) receivers where the matched filter statistic is fed directly into the reduced trellis or tree search algorithm without further processing. The MF-DFSE (S) 2 receiver was proposed in [5, 28]. <p> It decorrelates only the part due to the autocorrelation of the front-end filter response while the part which is due to the dispersion caused by the medium response fc (n)g is left untouched. 8 Biased receivers Several biased receivers are possible. One example is a DFSE receiver considered in <ref> [20] </ref>. It comprises a front-end filter matched to the overall channel response followed by the noise-whitening filter P = F H . The reduced trellis search algorithm uses the branch metric formulation R = I, Q = S. <p> However, it performs quite poorly due to the presence of untreated interference components. Also shown in Fig. 8 is a biased WF-DFSE receiver with the configuration P 1 = F H ; Q = S; R = I, considered in <ref> [20] </ref>. Again the effect of untreated interference is evident. The untreated interference arises due to a mismatch between the processing filter and the branch metric as discussed in Section 8. Fig. 9 shows the simulated BER performance of the WF-MA, ZF-MA and MF-MA receivers for the channel in Example 1.

In this paper, we extend the techniques of DFSE and M-algorithm to operate on the output of a general transversal processing filter which follows a front-end matched filter. <p> The whitening filter DFSE (WF-DFSE) and whitening filter M-algorithm (WF-MA) receivers with a standard matched filter are the well-known receivers described in <ref> [6, 8, 21, 1, 26] </ref>. The zero-forcing DFSE (ZF-DFSE) receiver with a standard matched filter was derived in [20]. <p> The scheme was originally proposed to operate on white (or whitened) statistics. However, it has also been used with the standard matched filter (see for example <ref> [29, 26] </ref>). The M-algorithm is essentially a reduced tree search algorithm. <p> The MF-DFSE receiver of this type was proposed in [5, 28]. The MF-MA receiver of this type was considered in <ref> [26, 29] </ref>. An upper bound on the first event error probability of the MF-DFSE (S) receiver was derived in [15, 14].

Reference-contexts: The residual interference that arises as a result limits the performance of these methods even at modest ISI levels [18]. Another approach is to pre-cancel the tail of the delay response using a linear or a decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The DFE approach <ref> [16, 27] </ref> suffers from severe error propagation on channels where the tail contains a significant fraction of the total energy in the channel while the linear pre-filtering approach [10, 19] enhances noise.
