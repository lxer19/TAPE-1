Reference-contexts: Their execution times are very large, because the problem is NP-complete, so we could only apply them to small networks. The third optimal algorithm is the least-delay, LD, MC routing algorithm. We implemented it as a Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm <ref> (Bertsekas and Gallager 1992) </ref> in which C (e) = D (e), i.e. it guarantees minimum end-to-end delay from the source to each MC group member.

Reference-contexts: We study LC's performance in networks with delay constraints to determine its applicability to networks that are heavily loaded with multimedia applications. The reverse path multicasting, RPM, algorithm <ref> (Deering and Cheriton 1990) </ref> creates MC trees for which the cost of the reverse path, i.e. the path from the destination to the source, is minimal. The cost of the forward path is minimal only if the network has symmetric link costs.

Reference-contexts: The cost of the forward path is minimal only if the network has symmetric link costs. RPM is an attractive choice for network developers, because it can be implemented in a distributed fashion. Protocol Independent Multicasting (PIM) <ref> (Deering et.al. 1995) </ref> is a candidate protocol for multicasting over the Internet. PIM uses a dynamic MC routing algorithm based on RPM. Thus it is important to study RPM to determine how asymmetric link loads affect its performance.

Reference-contexts: Thus simple MC routing algorithms were sufficient to manage the network bandwidth. In many cases MC trees were simply constructed by the superposition of multiple unicast paths. The situation is different, however, for the emerging real-time applications discussed above. For example, videoconferencing is now available over the Internet <ref> (Macedonia and Brutzman 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We will study how efficient it is when applied to directed networks with delay constraints. Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm (with link cost being a function of the link utilization) is widely used in communication protocols, e.g. MOSPF <ref> (Moy 1992) </ref>, and it yields satisfactory performance. It is a least-cost, LC, algorithm which minimizes the cost of the path from the source node to each MC group member individually.

Reference-contexts: This problem is known to be NP-complete. Winter (1987) provides a survey of both exact and heuristic minimum Steiner tree algorithms. If the destination set of a minimum Steiner tree includes all nodes in the network, it is called a minimum spanning tree <ref> (Prim 1957) </ref>. The upper bound on acceptable end-to-end delay, , is part of the QoS requirements of distributed multimedia applications, and it is necessary and sufficient for the network to satisfy the given bound, i.e. there is no need to minimize the end-to-end delay. <p> When the granularity is comparable to the average link delays, KPP's accuracy is compromised and in many cases it can not even construct a constrained MC tree. We use a granularity of =10. Both KMB and KPP heuristics use Prim's algorithm <ref> (PRIM 1957) </ref> to obtain a minimum spanning tree when given a closure graph. Prim's algorithms is only optimal for undirected networks. This might affect the performance of the two heuristics when applied to directed networks. Widyono (1994) proposed four unconstrained MC heuristics and four CST heuristics.

Reference-contexts: The heuristic then constructs a broadcast tree that does not violate the internal delay constraint. Finally the broadcast tree is pruned beyond the MC nodes. In <ref> (Salama et.al. 1994) </ref> we implemented the original algorithm proposed in (Waters 1994) which resembles a semi-constrained minimum spanning tree, and we also implemented a modified version which is closer to a semi-constrained shortest paths broadcast tree.

The modified version always performs better with respect to tree costs, end-to-end delays, and network balancing.

Reference-contexts: The positions of the nodes are fixed in a rectangle of size 3000 fl 2400 Km 2 , roughly the area of the USA. A random generator <ref> (Waxman 1988) </ref> was used to create links interconnecting pairs of nodes The x A superedge is a path in the tree between two branching nodes or two MC group members or a branching node and a MC group member. probability of a link to exist between any two nodes is a

Reference-contexts: Thus KPP takes polynomial time only if is bounded. When the link delays and take non integer values it is necessary to limit the granularity of the computation in order to achieve reasonable running times. The side effects of this are discussed in <ref> (Widyono 1994) </ref>. When the granularity is comparable to the average link delays, KPP's accuracy is compromised and in many cases it can not even construct a constrained MC tree. We use a granularity of =10.

Reference-contexts: Very few algorithms have been proposed for the minimum Steiner tree problem in directed networks <ref> (Winter 1987) </ref>, and all of them operate under special conditions, e.g. acyclic networks, and thus they can not be applied to the networks we work on. In the case of undirected networks, however, there are several heuristics of reasonable complexity.

Reference-contexts: CAO is always capable of constructing a constrained MC tree, if one exists, because of the nature of the breadth first search it conducts. The bounded shortest multicast algorithm, BSMA, is another CST heuristic <ref> (Zhu, Parsa, and Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1995) </ref>. BSMA starts by computing a LD tree for a given source s and MC group G i .
