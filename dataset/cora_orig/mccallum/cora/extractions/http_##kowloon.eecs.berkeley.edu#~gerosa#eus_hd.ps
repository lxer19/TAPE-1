Abstract: This work presents a new architecture for the realization of Hard Disk Drive Read Channels, using EPR-IV equalization. The pre-equalization is realized as a sampled-data system in order to have precise pulse shaping and simply tunable bandwidth. The equalization is then completed by a fractionally spaced equalizer, which ensures low sensitivity to sampling phase variation. The system complexity is reduced with respect to typical solutions, while the performances are within the usual specs in every operating condition, as confirmed by careful simulations. The architecture was designed to be integrated in a standard CMOS IC.

Reference-contexts: Indeed the constant request for higher data rates and storage densities has resulted in the application of advanced techniques of equalization and detection. For instance the Partial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) <ref> [1] </ref> equalization became a standard for HD drive systems, in order to achieve high data rates. <p> Hence all the system requirements are well achievable using switched capacitor circuits in standard CMOS technology [8]. 3 SIMULATION RESULTS The proposed system performances were carefully simulated using MATLAB. It is well established that the HD channel can be modeled as a PAM system, with additive Gaussian white noise <ref> [1] </ref>. To model the channel impulse response a Lorentian impulse, l (t), can be used, whose analytical expression is l (t) = 1 + ( 2t The parameter P W 50 is the pulse width at half amplitude and is directly related to the disk storage density.

The HD equalizer are usually adaptive in order to compensate for time varying parameters; moreover they are frequency tunable, as the system data rate is changing within different disk tracks, and programmable, in order to compensate for storage density variations. <p> In Fig. 2 the equalizer output is reported for a P W 50 equal to 2.5 and an input noise corresponding to SN R = 21 dB. Since RLL coding was applied on the written sequence, the EPRIV signal is actually reduced to three output states <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally additional digital processing is applied, performing extra equalization and sequence detection. This equalizer is in fact very sensitive to sampling phase variations <ref> [7] </ref>, therefore a timing feedback loop is necessary to compensate for any clock variation. This work proposes a different solution for an EPRIV equalizer, based mainly on two changes.

Reference-contexts: This work proposes a different solution for an EPRIV equalizer, based mainly on two changes. The first change consists in the realization of the pre-equalizer as a sampled data system, which is more suitable for frequency tuning and transfer function adaptation or programmability <ref> [8] </ref> and, in addition, can perform more precise pulse shaping. This change prompts the second one. In fact, since the sampled data solution is oversam-pled, the following step is to apply Fractionally Spaced Equalization (FSE) [9], which is highly insensitive to sampling phase. <p> This makes the pre-equalizer programmable. Usually in standard sampled data systems at this point the signal is downsampled to the nominal data rate and eventually additional processing before detection is performed in the analog or digital domain <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> However the Delayed N-Path architectures [10] can easily overcome this problem. Hence all the system requirements are well achievable using switched capacitor circuits in standard CMOS technology <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 SIMULATION RESULTS The proposed system performances were carefully simulated using MATLAB. It is well established that the HD channel can be modeled as a PAM system, with additive Gaussian white noise [1].

Therefore in the proposed system the complexity related to sampling phase control is drastically reduced. Moreover the discrete-time processing has shown to give enough signal equalization, so that the typical digital post-equalization is no more needed. <p> of the Fourier transform of the input signal and the data rate T , according to CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATIONS; to appear on Proc. of EUSIPCO-98 Rhodes (Greece) - 8-11 SEP 98 3 ~ F (!) = k 2 fi 2 fl where the dependence from the sampling phase t is apparent <ref> [9] </ref>.

In this technique the equalization is completely performed at an oversam-pled data-rate, therefore no aliasing can occur, as the Nyquist frequency is boosted by the oversampling factor. After this processing the signal is downsampled to its nominal data-rate.

Reference-contexts: As the sampling frequency in modern HD channels is approaching 300MHz, the oversampled architecture may become a concern for the bandwidth requirements for Operational Amplifiers. However the Delayed N-Path architectures <ref> [10] </ref> can easily overcome this problem. Hence all the system requirements are well achievable using switched capacitor circuits in standard CMOS technology [8]. 3 SIMULATION RESULTS The proposed system performances were carefully simulated using MATLAB.

Reference-contexts: A better approach would be to allow the second sampler for larger phase variation, but this case revealed to be more sensitive to instability problem. Since, even in the worst case, the simplest algorithm converges within 100 cycles, which is a usually acceptable period <ref> [11] </ref>, we chose for the more robust implementation. Finally it is worth to notice that the control signal can be extracted directly by the block that controls the adaptive FIR, therefore no additional error extraction is required.
