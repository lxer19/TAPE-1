Abstract: We prove that boundedness and reachability tree finiteness are undecidable for systems of two identical automata communicating via two perfect unbounded one-way FIFO channels and constructed solely from cycles about their initial states. Using a form of mutual exclusion for such systems, we prove further that undecidability holds even when the identical automata are totally indistinguishable in the sense that their initial states are identical and both channels are initially empty.

Reference-contexts: In a different vein, for purposes of modeling distributed algorithms in which processes are identical, and in light of the surprising difficulty of problems like leader election in anonymous networks (see for example [12]), it is interesting to consider systems of identical CFSMs. For example, Benslimane in <ref> [3] </ref> claims decidability results for restricted classes of systems of identical CFSMs 1 .

We specify only one initial CFSM A, with the understanding that A 1 and A 2 are identical copies of A. <p> Hence fl must contain infinitely many cycles of type 3 or 4. 2 Consider a state s = (1; 1; fl 1 ; fl 2 ) in RS (S; s 0 ).

More precisely, even if the communicating automata are 16 identical, indistinguishable and initial, the finite reachability tree problem and the boundedness problem remain undecidable.

Hence Q is the state set, q 0 2 Q the initial state, the input alphabet, the tape alphabet, B 2 the blank symbol, and ffi : Q fi ! Q fi fi fleft; rightg the (partial) transition function.

Interestingly, although leader election is provably impossible in such networks (see <ref> [12] </ref>), we succeed in "initializing a leader" by ensuring that unwanted computations are blocked (such deadlocks are generally disallowed in distributed algorithms). Section 2 in this paper defines notation. Section 3 presents our basic simulation and undecidability result.
