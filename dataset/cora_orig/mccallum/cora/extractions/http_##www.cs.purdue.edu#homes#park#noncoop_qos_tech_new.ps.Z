Abstract: This paper studies the quality of service (QoS) provision problem in noncooperative networks where applications or users are selfish and routers implement a general class of packet scheduling disciplines which includes weighted fair queueing. First, we formulate a model of QoS provision in noncooperative networks where users are given the freedom to choose both the service classes and traffic volume allocated, and heterogenous QoS preferences are captured by individual utility functions. We present the first comprehensive analysis of the noncooperative multi-class QoS provision game, giving a complete characterization of Nash equilibria and their existence criteria, and we show under what conditions they are Pareto and system optimal. We show that, in general, Nash equilibria need not exist, and when they do exist, they need not be Pareto nor system optimal. Our conclusions stand in contrast to previous works on noncooperative network games including congestion control and routing games that depict an overly optimistic picture of the world stemming from restrictive assumptions and special case analysis. However, we show that for certain "resource-plentiful" systems, the world indeed can be "nice" with Nash equilibria, Pareto optima, and system optima collapsing into a single class. Second, we study the problem of facilitating effective quality of service provision in systems with multi-dimensional QoS vectors containing both mean- and burstiness-related QoS measures. We extend the game-theoretic analysis to multi-dimensional QoS vector games and show under what conditions the aforementioned results carry over. Motivated by the same context, we study the impact of burstiness under multiple QoS measures on the properties of the induced QoS levels rendered by the service classes in the system. We show that under bursty traffic conditions, it is, in many cases, impossible for a service class to deliver quality of service superior in both mean- and burstiness-related QoS measures (e.g., packet loss rate and jitter) when weighted fair queueing is employed at routers. This somewhat surprising result, although general in its scope, has implications to what application QoS requirements can be effectively met in the noncooperative QoS provision architecture, and how routers should configure their services such that a broad spectrum of application QoS requirements can be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: The formal network QoS provision game is defined in Section 2. We are given n applications or users and m service classes where each user i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> has a traffic demand given by its mean data rate i . <p> user can choose where and how much of its traffic to apportion to the m service classes given by its allocation vector fl i = ( i1 ; i2 ; : : : ; im ) T where ij 0 and P The QoS achieved in service class j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> is determined by a QoS function c j (e.g., packet loss rate), and c j is monotone in q j where q j = P i ij . The generalization to multi-dimensional QoS vectors is shown in Section 4.1. <p> A collection of papers covering a broad range of topics can be found in [4]. A brief survey of some of the literature is provided in [12]. Some standard references to game theory and microeconomics include <ref> [1, 15, 41, 45, 46] </ref>. Many of the earlier papers including some recent ones [14, 13, 25, 31, 43] have espounded a cooperative game theory framework to model user interactions and derive results based on Pareto optimality. <p> In our model, there is no a priori fixed 1-1 correspondence of players to service classes. Indeed, the very essence of the QoS provision problem is to give each player i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> the freedom to choose where she wants to send her traffic, from service class 1 all the way to service class m. Hence, our QoS provision model is fundamentally different from the flow control models, being more complex and producing equilibria structures that are different from [21], [44]. <p> Phrased in our language, the set of parallel links correspond to the service classes j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and a user i's average throughput demand i is assigned to the m routes given by the assignment vector fl i = ( i1 ; i2 ; : : : ; im ). <p> The service rate of the system is given by and we will assume that the switch implements a form of weighted fair queueing (WFQ) with service weights ff 1 ; ff 2 ; : : : ; ff m where ff j 0, j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, and j=1 ff j = 1. Here, m denotes the number of service classes. The total service rate is split between the two traffic classes = R + NR . <p> The video application, on the other hand, can only tolerate much smaller loss rates, and its utility is concentrated toward 0. Selfishness Selfishness, in our context, will mean that each application i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> will try to take actions so as to maximize its individual utility U i . <p> We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. Let ij 0, i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, j 2 [1; m], denote the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Thus, i = P m j=1 ij . That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. <p> We arrive at a resource allocation problem in the following way. Let ij 0, i 2 [1; n], j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, denote the traffic volume of the i'th application assigned to service class j. Thus, i = P m j=1 ij . That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. <p> That is, application i is given the freedom to choose which service classes to assign her traffic to and how much. We also consider the special case when traffic assignments are restricted to be "all in one bag," i.e., ij 2 f i ; 0g, for all j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Let fl = ( ij : i; j) denote the resource assignment matrix, and let c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c m be the packet loss rates of the m service classes. <p> Each packet loss rate is a function of fl, c j = c j (fl); j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>: Assuming isolatedness (cf. Section 1.2), we have c j = c j (q j ) where q j = P n i=1 ij is the total traffic volume assigned to class j. <p> That is, L i (fl) is the set of all unilateral strategies for player i. An assignment fl fl is a Nash equilibrium if 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, 8fl 2 L i (fl fl ), U i (fl) U i (fl fl ): That is, in a Nash equilibrium, player i cannot improve its individual utility U i by unilaterally changing its strategy. <p> From a resource allocation perspective, we would also like to know under what conditions Nash equilibria are Pareto and system optimal 7 . Simplifying Assumption To make the analysis tractable, we will work with (unit) step utility functions where for each player i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, U i (c) = 1; if c i , 0; otherwise. Here i 0 is a threshold that represents the i'th application's preference. <p> Here i 0 is a threshold that represents the i'th application's preference. Since c j = c j (q j ), j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, there exist b ij 0 such that U i (c j (q j )) = 1; if q j b ij , 0; otherwise. 7 We note that in the ordinal (vs. cardinal) approach to modeling with utility functions, one refrains assigning values to utilities for the simple reason <p> Following is a simple but often used fact on the induced ordering of the traffic volume thresholds b ij . It is a consequence of the total ordering of i and the monotonicity of c j . Proposition 3.1 8i 2 <ref> [1; n 1] </ref>, 8j 2 [1; m], b ij b i+1j . Next, we define certain subsets of service classes|parameterized by user i|that come into play when characterizing Nash equilibria. <p> Following is a simple but often used fact on the induced ordering of the traffic volume thresholds b ij .

Let I + i = f j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> : q j &gt; b ij ; ij &gt; 0 g, I I 0 i = f j 2 [1; m] : q j = b ij g. That is, I + i denotes the set of service class indices where player i has assigned a positive flow and the total traffic volume allocated exceeds player i's threshold. Thus user i attains 0 utility in these service classes. <p> Let q i j = k6=i kj . That is, q i j is the traffic volume assigned to service class j not counting player i's contribution (if any). Hence q j = ij + q i j . i = f j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> : q i i = f j 2 [1; m] : q i j &lt; b ij g. Hence J + i is the set of service classes where, irrespective of player i's actions, player i cannot garner any utility. <p> That is, q i j is the traffic volume assigned to service class j not counting player i's contribution (if any). Hence q j = ij + q i j . i = f j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref> : q i i = f j 2 [1; m] : q i j &lt; b ij g.

Let J fl i = f j 2 [1; m] : b ij q i min k2J b ik <p> <ref> [1; m] </ref> : q i i = f j 2 [1; m] : q i j &lt; b ij g. Hence J + i is the set of service classes where, irrespective of player i's actions, player i cannot garner any utility. Let J fl i = f j 2 [1; m] : b ij q i min k2J b ik q i i is the subset of service classes of J i where the positive utility achievable by user i is minimal. <p> Recall that the latter is denoted by L i (fl) where fl is any configuration.

Of course, to maintain comparability, we will assume that the n input processes are i.i.d. Somewhat counter-intuitively, we will show that the answer is in the negative. <p> We associate prices p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p m with the service classes, and applications incur a cost of ij p j for sending a traffic volume of ij tagged by service class identifier j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Each application is assigned a one-time budget B i "sufficient" for the simulation duration. We also assume that assignments are of the type "all in one bag," i.e., unsplittable. The selfishness behavior of applications is modeled in the following way. <p> That is, x j i and p j is minimal. Thus, applications are assumed to assign a nonzero utility to "money." If no such service class j exists|i.e., 8j 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>, x j fi i |then i submits its traffic to a service class j 0 that most closely meets its QoS requirements, however, paying a price of p j 0 + ffi where ffi &gt; 0 is a bid parameter. <p> Let A j denote the set of applications i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> currently assigned to service class j 2 [1; m].

Some of the works employ a cooperative framework or place significant computing responsibilities on the part of the user [31, 43], some investigate the effect of pricing incentives <ref> [5] </ref>, and others represent flow/congestion control and routing models that only 1 We will use the terms users, applications, and sometimes, players, interchangeably. 1 partially address the quality of service problem [21, 33, 44]. Our approach differs from previous works in two significant ways. <p> Other implementations worth noting include Wellman's work on multicommodity flow problems [48, 49]. QoS-Related Network Games Several papers have addressed the specific issue of multi-class QoS provision in high-speed networks using microeconomic models <ref> [5, 31, 43, 18] </ref>. In [31, 43], utility functions are defined with link bandwidth and switch buffers acting as substitutable resources. Pareto-optimal allocation of resources among service classes is affected either by the network exercising admission control [43] or by users performing purchasing decisions [31]. <p> In both approaches, it is assumed that QoS guarantees are computable, given specific resource reservations. As stated earlier, an important goal of our approach is to shield the user from having to make complex computations to estimate service quality. In <ref> [5] </ref>, a general framework for investigating pricing in networks is proposed, with service discipline and pricing policy acting as design variables. Simulation results are shown that depict the existence of "desirable" price ranges related to system optimality. <p> Four types of applications with different QoS requirements were tested with priority settings set either to 1 or 2. Our model is an n-application, m-service class, s-dimensional QoS vector quality service provision model, and emphasizes a different set of questions from that of <ref> [5] </ref> where the effect of pricing incentives are paramount. We apply noncooperative game-theoretic analysis to the multi-dimensional QoS vector model to understand under what conditions Nash equilibria exist and how they are related to Pareto and system optimality.

Comparison with Congestion Control Models by Korilis et al. and Shenker The flow or congestion control models of Korilis et al. <ref> [21] </ref> and Shenker [44] represent a form of quality of service provision and it is important to explicate the differences between our model and theirs, given that all three follow the noncooperative framework. <p> Phrased in the language of the QoS provision 5 model defined in Section 1.2 (a formal definition is given in Section 2.3), both <ref> [21] </ref> and [44] correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to the fixed service class i, and either ii 0 [44] or 0 ii i [21], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. <p> the QoS provision 5 model defined in Section 1.2 (a formal definition is given in Section 2.3), both <ref> [21] </ref> and [44] correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to the fixed service class i, and either ii 0 [44] or 0 ii i [21], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j.

Our approach differs from previous works in two significant ways. We devote significant effort to explicating the differences in the modeling assumptions and their relevance to network QoS provision, casting our new results in this light. <p> We also note that this is the first comprehensive analysis of a noncooperative multi-class QoS provision system where the utility function depends on both the player i as well as the particular service class j where traffic has been assigned. Orda et al. <ref> [33] </ref> study the only other equally comprehensive QoS provision model formulated in the routing context (actually isomorphic to the present model under a certain transformation). <p> The noncooperative network resource allocation approach has been actively pursued by Lazar and his co-workers beginning in the late '80s [19, 2] with more recent work carried out jointly with Korilis and Orda <ref> [20, 21, 22, 23, 33] </ref>. Their main work has revolved around an optimal flow control problem, and the development of techniques needed to show the existence of Nash equilibria [21]. <p> Korilis et al. [22, 23] have also looked at the problem of using interventions by an impartial external entity|the network manager|to steer a system toward Nash equilibria that are system optimal. Of special interest is Orda et al.'s work on routing games <ref> [33] </ref> which is intimately related to the multi-class QoS provision model studied in this paper. This is further explicated below. <p> Secondly, our model incorporates multi-dimensional QoS vectors whose consequences are then analyzed in both game-theoretic and network performance terms. Comparison with Orda et al.'s Routing Model In <ref> [33] </ref>, Orda et al. present a noncooperative routing game where a set of users with fixed throughput demands have a choice of assigning their flow to a set of parallel links or routes. <p> As is formally defined in Section 2.3, in our QoS provision game, the utility function has the form ij U i (c j (q j )); thus the utility's dependence on heterogenous user preferences is preserved. Hence the results proved in <ref> [33] </ref> for type-B and type-C functions correspond to a population of users with homogenous preferences, and thus do not carry over to the more general and complex QoS provision game studied here. <p> Convexity and quasi-convexity, in the QoS provision context, lead to consequences worlds apart. More specifically, the assumption that J i j is convex in ij is needed in <ref> [33] </ref> to invoke Rosen's theorem [40], a common tool for exhibiting the existence of Nash equilibria. Rosen's theorem, in turn, uses Kakutani's fixed point theorem to establish existence. <p> The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the overall set-up and formulate the network QoS provision model. In particular, Section 2.3 discusses the differences between our model and the model of Orda et al. <ref> [33] </ref>. This is followed by Section 3 which gives a game-theoretic analysis of the QoS provision game structure. Section 4.1 extends the game-theoretic analysis to multi-dimensional QoS vectors and Section 4.2 studies the effect of burstiness on the characteristics of rendered QoS. <p> This disables the application of Rosen's theorem [40], which in our case|due to Lemma 3.5|is synonymous with non-existence of Nash equilibria. Relating back to Orda et al.'s routing game <ref> [33] </ref>, this is also the rigorous underpinning of the discussion given in Section 1.4 which showed why it is problematic to assume concavity (i.e., convexity for minimization in [33]) in their routing model. <p> Relating back to Orda et al.'s routing game <ref> [33] </ref>, this is also the rigorous underpinning of the discussion given in Section 1.4 which showed why it is problematic to assume concavity (i.e., convexity for minimization in [33]) in their routing model. It is not difficult to see that discontinuity, caused by the step function assumption of U i , did not play an essential role in the previous argument.

We also incorporate more realistic traffic conditions in the form of self-similar background traffic <ref> [28, 36] </ref> that possess varying degrees of long-range dependence. The simulation results of this section were carried out using LBNL's Network Simulator ns (version 2), suitably modified to transport application/background traffic using modules running on top of UDP. <p> The domination in time property can be seen to hold for the delay process as well. Impact of Self-Similar Burstiness Self-similar traffic with long-range dependence possess a form of "scale-invariant burstiness" <ref> [36] </ref>. This roughly means that the variances of the time-aggregated processes do not dampen out as the time scale is increased. We have conducted experiments with self-similar background traffic possessing varying degrees of long-range dependence whose Hurst parameter 11 values were in the range 0.55-0.95.

Reference-contexts: Convexity and quasi-convexity, in the QoS provision context, lead to consequences worlds apart. More specifically, the assumption that J i j is convex in ij is needed in [33] to invoke Rosen's theorem <ref> [40] </ref>, a common tool for exhibiting the existence of Nash equilibria. Rosen's theorem, in turn, uses Kakutani's fixed point theorem to establish existence. <p> Even though L is convex, the set f ( i1 ; i2 ) : U i b i1 =2g is not convex: the projection onto L yields two separated line segments. This disables the application of Rosen's theorem <ref> [40] </ref>, which in our case|due to Lemma 3.5|is synonymous with non-existence of Nash equilibria.

In both approaches, it is assumed that QoS guarantees are computable, given specific resource reservations. As stated earlier, an important goal of our approach is to shield the user from having to make complex computations to estimate service quality.

Reference-contexts: Several papers have addressed the issue of multi-class QoS provision in high-speed networks <ref> [5, 21, 31, 44, 43, 38] </ref>. <p> place significant computing responsibilities on the part of the user [31, 43], some investigate the effect of pricing incentives [5], and others represent flow/congestion control and routing models that only 1 We will use the terms users, applications, and sometimes, players, interchangeably. 1 partially address the quality of service problem <ref> [21, 33, 44] </ref>. Our approach differs from previous works in two significant ways. We devote significant effort to explicating the differences in the modeling assumptions and their relevance to network QoS provision, casting our new results in this light. <p> Of special interest is Orda et al.'s work on routing games [33] which is intimately related to the multi-class QoS provision model studied in this paper. This is further explicated below. Another significant thrust in noncooperative network games is due to recent work by Shenker <ref> [44] </ref> where it is shown how choosing a packet scheduling discipline can influence the nature of the Nash equilibria attained. <p> We also investigate the problem of facilitating service classes with induced QoS levels that match application requirements under bursty traffic conditions. Comparison with Congestion Control Models by Korilis et al. and Shenker The flow or congestion control models of Korilis et al. [21] and Shenker <ref> [44] </ref> represent a form of quality of service provision and it is important to explicate the differences between our model and theirs, given that all three follow the noncooperative framework. <p> Phrased in the language of the QoS provision 5 model defined in Section 1.2 (a formal definition is given in Section 2.3), both [21] and <ref> [44] </ref> correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to the fixed service class i, and either ii 0 [44] or 0 ii i [21], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. <p> Phrased in the language of the QoS provision 5 model defined in Section 1.2 (a formal definition is given in Section 2.3), both [21] and <ref> [44] </ref> correspond to the situation where n = m, each player i is permanently assigned to the fixed service class i, and either ii 0 [44] or 0 ii i [21], but in both cases, ij = 0 for i 6= j. That is, a player, being tied to a fixed service class, has the option of controlling how much traffic [44]|or using what time schedule [21]|to send his traffic but not where. <p> Hence, our QoS provision model is fundamentally different from the flow control models, being more complex and producing equilibria structures that are different from [21], <ref> [44] </ref>. Secondly, our model incorporates multi-dimensional QoS vectors whose consequences are then analyzed in both game-theoretic and network performance terms. <p> One may use a number of different norms k k (we have used the sup norm) depending on the QoS vector make-up and the objectives at hand. The asymmetric price adjustment mechanism stems from our work with many-switch systems (also called network of switches in <ref> [44] </ref>) where each user or application makes its QoS requirement known using performance bounds.
