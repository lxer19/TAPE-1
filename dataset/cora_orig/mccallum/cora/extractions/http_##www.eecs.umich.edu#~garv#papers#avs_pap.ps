Abstract: A novel sensing system based on plasma impedance spectroscopy is compared to standard RF metrology. The system uses an antenna in the glow discharge to excite the bulk plasma at a frequency range of 27:5MHz to 2:75GHz . Standard RF metrology is implemented by measuring 1000 points of the RF power signal using a digital oscilloscope sampling at 1 GHz. An experiment varying power, pressure, Ar and O 2 is constructed. Using a subset of the data to regress a model, standard RF sensing reconstructs the experimental variables with a best average R 2 of 0:49 , whereas the novel sensing system results in a best average R 2 of 0:876. A nearest neighbor algorithm is used which results in 70% correct identification of process conditions for standard RF sensing, and 99:5% correct identification of process conditions for the novel sensing system.

Reference-contexts: One approach is a standard linear regression, as described in <ref> [20] </ref> or [21]. Since the dimension of response is larger than the number of experiments, subset selection must be used. Stepwise regression, as described in [22] is performed.

Stepwise Regression is a rigorous method for adjusting model size, using the partial F test <ref> [20] </ref> to evaluate whether the change in performance associated with the change in model size is statistically relevant. The specific implementation is as follows. The goal of the experiment is to build the largest model that produces a statistically significant performance improvement over the next largest model.

Given the non linear nature of plasma processing, the regression model can only be expected to be valid over a reasonably small subset of the operating space near the operating points.
