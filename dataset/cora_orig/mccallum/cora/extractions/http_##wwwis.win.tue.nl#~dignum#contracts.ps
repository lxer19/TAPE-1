Abstract: In cooperative systems many of the obligations, prohibitions and permissions that govern the behaviour of the system exist as a result of communication with users and/or other systems. In this paper we will discuss the role of illocutionary logic and deontic logic in modelling these communication processes and the resulting norms. The combination of illocutionary and deontic logic can be used to reason about communication structures. It is also possible to model the authorization relations, on the basis of which orders and requests can be made, and the delegation of these authoritizations in this logic.

Reference-contexts: A speech act is formalised as an illocutionary point (indicating the goal of the speech act) with three parameters: the Speaker, the Addressee, and the content. We distinguish the following basic speech acts (based upon <ref> [SV85, Aus62] </ref>): Definition 2.4 DIR (i,j,ff) i does a request to j for ff COM (i,j,ff) i commits himself to j to do ff ASS (i,j,OE) i asserts to j proposition OE DECL (i,j,OE) i declares and informs j that OE holds from now on From these basic speech acts we

Reference-contexts: In practice, a limited number of specific declaratives will be distinguished, such as the "authorization" action that we will introduce in section 2.2. Speech acts can be grounded in three different ways: charity, power and authorization. (See also <ref> [DW92] </ref> for a similar distinction as an improvement to the completely power based CSCW tool Coordinator ([FGHW88])).

Reference-contexts: Illocutionary logic [SV85] is a logical formalisation of the theory of speech acts [Se69] and is used to formally describe the communication structure itself. A first attempt to model communication using speech acts is made in the method SAMPO [LL86], but this does not include the deontic aspects. In <ref> [Lee88] </ref>, Lee presents a language and modelling technique for deontic rules, but these model procedures rather than communication structures. The fundamental reason for the use of deontic concepts is that coordination of behaviour always requires some form of mutual commitment.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case he usually is obliged to perform some new action that compensates for the violation. The description of the obligations and the manipulation of the obligations has been the subject of research in normative systems and deontic logic (see e.g. <ref> [MW93] </ref>). The interaction between agents can most easily be seen in the cases where a particular service is rendered from one agent to the other. A (simple) example of such a service is illustrated in the following picture. In general we can distinguish three phases of communication.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years there has been a growing interest in cooperative systems or cooperating agents (see e.g. <ref> [Po93] </ref>). However, little has been said about how these cooperating agents influence each other's behaviour. Each agent has certain capabilities, actions that it can perform. These actions can be material, such as opening a window, or communicative, such as providing some piece of information.
