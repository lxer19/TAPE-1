Abstract: My dissertation research solves a wide range of complexity and ambiguity problems that have hindered the application of qualitative simulation techniques to large, real-world problems for tasks such as monitoring, diagnosis and design. I have developed techniques to assist in the process of developing a model, extend the inference techniques used during simulation and provide tools for analyzing the results. Abstraction and decomposition techniques are used to avoid irrelevant distinctions and temporal logic model checking is integrated into the simulation of a constraint-based, structural model to provide a more expressive modeling language. The techniques developed ensure that the complexity of the simulation is a function of the problem specification as opposed to being an artifact of the simulation algorithm allowing previously intractable problems to be solved.
