This standard specifies the data path interface between the ATM layer (performing segmentation and reassembly) and the physical (PHY) layer components of an ATM subsystem. It can support a wide range of speeds, with data path widths of 8 or 16 bits.

Reference-contexts: Experiences from the five gigabit testbeds have shown that gigabit networking is not only possible, but can be very useful in a wide variety of application areas. At Washington University, we have an installed and operational 155 Mbps packet switched network <ref> [4] </ref>, and we are currently in the process of building a multirate ATM switching system [18] that will support data rates of 622 Mbps (SONET), 1.2 Gbps (G-link), and 2.4 Gbps (G-link) per port.

Reference-contexts: All of these features are detailed in the system architecture document for the APIC chip <ref> [7] </ref>; a future paper will focus only on these aspects of the APIC design. It should be noted that although our design assumes an underlying ATM-like network, many of our ideas are applicable (perhaps with some modification) to other types of networks, including connectionless (datagram) networks. <p> All memory mapped I/O commands as well as control cell commands are executed by the HMI. A complete specification and detailed design can be found in the APICs system architecture document <ref> [7] </ref>. 7 Conclusions We have estimated the complexity of various APIC modules. Based on these estimates, the prototype APIC will need about 200 square millimeters of silicon on a 0.5 micron process. The APICs core clock runs at 80 MHz.
