Abstract: We show that the largest similar copy of a convex polygon P with m edges inside a convex polygon Q with n edges can be computed in O(mn 2 log n) time. We also show that the combinatorial complexity of the space of all similar copies of P inside Q is O(mn 2 ), and that it can also be computed in O(mn 2 log n) time. Let P be a convex polygon with m edges and Q a convex polygon with n edges. Our goal is to find the largest similar copy of P inside Q (allowing translation, rotation, and scaling of P ); see Figure 1. A restricted version of this problem, in which we just determine whether P can be placed inside Q without scaling, was solved by Chazelle [4], in O(mn 2 ) time. See also [1, 6, 12] for other approaches to the more general problem, in which Q is an arbitrary polygonal region. (We remark that the complexity of the algorithms for the general case is considerably higher, about O(m 2 n 2 ) in [1], O(m 3 n 2 ) in [12], and O(m 4 n 2 ) in [6].) Problems concerning the placement of one polygon inside another are important in robotics and manufacturing. This restricted problem is also applicable to an approach to object recognition recently proposed by Basri and Jacobs [3], based on matching two-dimensional faces of polyhedral objects. The transformation which places the largest similar copy of a polygon P derived from a face of an object model inside a polygon Q derived from an image is a candidate for a transformation which matches the entire model to the image.

Reference-contexts: Hence, to complete our algorithm, we need to detect and discard the facets of the hulls conv (S K ) which are not facets of D. This is accompished as follows. We triangulate each computed facet F into O (jF j) tetrahedra, using the bottom-vertex triangulation scheme described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Let denote the set of resulting tetrahedra; jj = O (mn 2 ).

Reference-contexts: Q, such that at each of them four distinct vertices of P touch four distinct edges of Q? This extends a similar open problem, asking for (mn 2 ) congruent placements of P inside Q, each with three contacts of distinct vertices of P with distinct edges of Q; see <ref> [9] </ref> for details. (2) Another open problem is whether the algorithm for finding the largest similar placement of P inside Q can be improved.
