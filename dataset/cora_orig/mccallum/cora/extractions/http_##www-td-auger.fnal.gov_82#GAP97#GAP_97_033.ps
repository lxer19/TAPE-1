Abstract: A water Cerenkov detector (WCD) prototype of reduced dimensions (cylinder 1.54 m diameter filled with purified water up to a height of 1.2 m) is used to obtain preliminary experimental results that validate the concept of remote calibration and monitoring of WCDs by using muons that stop and decay inside the WCD and, in a complementary way, muons that cross the WCD. The WCD prototype is located in Puebla and consists of a polyethylene tank with an inside covering of tyvek as reflecting surface, with one 8 00 photomultiplier (PMT) located at the water surface at the center of the tank looking downwards. A custom-made CAMAC TDC module was used to trigger on events having two consecutive PMT pulses within a time window of 25.6 s. A PC-based DAQ system was used to store the time interval between consecutive pulses and the waveform of the two pulses, as recorded by a digital scope, for a large number of events. By using adequate cuts, samples of stopping and crossing-muon events were obtained and analysed. Three clear peaks of charge distributions of PMT pulses have been identified which are useful for calibration and monitoring of WCDs: one for stopping muons, one for decay electrons and one for crossing muons. The average number of photoelectrons produced by the decay electron is found to be 0.18 times the average number produced by vertical muons; the mean number of photoelectrons produced by crossing muons (excluding corner clipping muons) is 1.09 times that produced by vertical muons; and the mean number of photoelectrons produced by stopping muons is 0.12 times the average number produced by vertical muons. These numbers require further crosschecks with experiments and simulations but the overall scheme appears to be practical.

Reference-contexts: Each WCD consists of a 10 m 2 cross section cylindrical tank filled with water up to a height of 1.2 m with three 8 00 PMT's looking downwards at the top of the water surface <ref> [1] </ref>. In the present paper we present Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: Whereas the first one corresponds to stopping muons. The latter form the low energy component, with energies up to about 300 MeV, of the background of muons present in the secondary cosmic ray radiation with a typical flux of 250 muons m 2 s 1 at ground level <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This technique is discussed in this paper and is also described in [3] for the case of unsegmented tanks and in <ref> [4] </ref> for the segmented case. One advantage of the methods presented here is that they apply equally well to segmented and unsegmented tanks, with the additional handle in the case of unsegmented tanks of using coincidental pulses in the PMTs to reduce PMT noise.

Reference-contexts: The inner surface of the tank is lined with a highly reflective tyvek sheet (reflectivity of about 90% in the ultraviolet region of the EM spectrum) cut to the cylindrical shape and kept in place by circular PVC hoses tightly stretched against the inner walls of the tank <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 downwards was located at the center of the tank with the PMT slightly immersed in the water. The PMT signal was transmitted via RG58 coaxial cable to a digital osciloscope, Tektronix TDS220, and to a commercial NIM discriminator module. The discrimination threshold used was 30 mV. <p> to the data using the function P 1 + P 2 exp (t=P 3 ). for the charge distribution of the decay electron from figure 4 with the peak position for the charge distribution of muons crossing the WCD vertically which was measured and turned out to be 250 pC <ref> [5] </ref>, we conclude that the average Cerenkov light radiated by the decay electron is 0.18 times the Cerenkov signal coming from muons crossing the WCD vertically. The rate of raw data events in figure 2 is about 80 Hz.

Reference-contexts: The waveform was digitized using the digital scope with a sampling period of 10 ns. The integrated charge and the amplitude of the PMT pulses were obtained o*ine from the recorded waveform for every event. The analysis was carried out by using PAW <ref> [6] </ref>.
