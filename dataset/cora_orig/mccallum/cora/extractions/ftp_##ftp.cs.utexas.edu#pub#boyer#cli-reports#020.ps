Reference-contexts: Examples of equations that scale a microprogrammable microprocessor, which is comparable in complexity to a PDP 11, from gates to machine language, can be found in [Hunt 87]. Equations that scale a machine language program of 750 16-bit words into a simple multi-tasking operating system kernel are described in <ref> [Bevier 87a] </ref>. How this kind of scaling can be continued upward to define the equations for a small subset of a high level programming language, Gypsy [Good 86], is described in [Bevier 87b]. But, let's be careful.
