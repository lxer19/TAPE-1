Reference-contexts: So both behaviors can be gathered into a compatible group. We use checkboxes to allow users to turn on and off compatible behaviors. There are some advanced behaviors that are even more general than compatible behaviors. For example, one might have a stack of magic lenses <ref> [1] </ref>. The composite effect of lenses usually depends on the order in which they superimpose one another. Therefore, besides turning them on or off, users might also want to reorder them to produce the specific effects they expect. We refer to those advanced behaviors as reorderable.
