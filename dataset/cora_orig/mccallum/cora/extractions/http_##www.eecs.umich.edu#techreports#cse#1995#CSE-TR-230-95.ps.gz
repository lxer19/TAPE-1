Title: The Generalized Railroad Crossing Problem: An Evolving Algebra Based Solution  
Author: Yuri Gurevich, James K. Huggins, and Raghu Mani 
Abstract: We present an evolving algebra based solution for the Generalized Railroad Crossing problem a specification and verification benchmark proposed by C. Heitmeyer at NRL. We specify the system as an evolving algebra and prove that the specification satisfies the desired safety and liveness properties.

Included within is a unary function Mod such that, in each global state S, the range of Mod consists of the elements of S representing modules. Agents are elements in the domain of Mod.

Trains are not modeled explicitly; instead, we use external functions to model train movements within the region.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Generalized Railway Crossing problem involves specifying a system that controls a railway crossing gate and proving the safety and liveness of the system. The problem statement (taken from <ref> [6] </ref>) is as follows. The system to be developed operates a gate at a railroad crossing. The railroad crossing I lies in a region of interest R, i.e., I R. A set of trains travel through R on multiple tracks in both directions. <p> We also treat time at a high level of abstraction. Similar assumptions are made in <ref> [6] </ref>.
