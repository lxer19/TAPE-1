Title: Using Hindsight in Medical Decision Making

Abstract: As the clinical picture of a patient evolves over time, more information becomes available. Certain procedures require time to perform, causing a delay between the time when the tests are ordered and when the results are available. Furthermore, as the patient's condition changes over time, serial measurements can be made. The availability of more data allows a more accurate assessment of the patient. Uncertainties, guesses or errors that were made early in the clinical course of patient care can also be identified and resolved when more information is available. Reasoning with a stream of data that changes over time presents a challenge to the designers of expert systems. The use of hindsight in expert systems requires that appropriate attention be paid to the temporal relations of the data and that care is exercised in revising decisions. I present a data-dependency system, the Temporal Control Structure (tcs), designed to support reasoning with data changing over time and show how it can be used to implement reasoning by hindsight.

Reference-contexts: When extending a program beyond the single consultation setting of mycin, the overhead of doing an incremental update is saved by only changing that part of the reasoning affected by the change in the data. It is similar to the work done in Truth Maintenance Systems (tms) <ref> [5, 7, 8, 18] </ref>. A tms does not include a temporal component, so it cannot accord time special handling. In particular, the temporal argument that is used to generate reasoning by hindsight cannot be made in those systems.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the temporal argument that is used to generate reasoning by hindsight cannot be made in those systems. Furthermore, they impose a restriction on the type of calculation that is done in combining information. 2 Dean and McDermott <ref> [6] </ref>, have extended a tms system to add time, but their Time Map Manager (tmm) still retains the predicate calculus representation and inference methods.

Reference-contexts: Model-based calculations are particularly interesting because of the ability to revise the output of the models as underlying assumptions change. Some mathematical models that have been developed, for example by Jelliffe <ref> [10] </ref>, are adaptive in the sense that information provided by testing the predicted variable can be used to refine and customize the model parameters. By making such data available through the history/oracle mechanism, the outputs of those models can be changed and the changes propagated through 15 the reasoning network.

Reference-contexts: The blood pressure only went up to 90/50 and her hands remained ice cold and the S3 gallop and bibasilar rales persisted. The arrhythmias improved, but multifocal VPBs and short runs of ventricular tachycardia still persisted. An arterial line was put in and the blood pressure was 200/120. <ref> [12, p. 34] </ref> This patient's reaction to her cardiac problem was to shut down blood flow to the extremities to such a degree that the blood pressure reading obtained by using a cuff on the arm was no longer representative of the true blood pressure in the core of the body.

Reference-contexts: This abstract strategy is refined into the concrete recommendation of dopamine and lidocaine (Figure 2). The transformation of point data to intervals in the tcs is discussed in greater detail in <ref> [16] </ref>. As more information becomes available (at time 24 and 25), the assessment is reconsidered. The arrhythmia remains a problem, but since it is improving, the program concludes that the choice of lidocaine is correct and should be continued.

Reference-contexts: The interval of action (in which a module is represented by a process instance) is chosen by tcs. It is guaranteed that each interval variable will have exactly one value throughout the interval over which a module is scheduled (See <ref> [19] </ref>). The number of such process instances for any given module will depend on the data available. As more information becomes available, more instances will be created.

Reference-contexts: It also allows incorrect data to be corrected and is insensitive to the order in which data is made available to the system. This section give a short description of the tcs. A more complete account can be found in <ref> [20] </ref>. 2.1 Temporal Control Structure Components Tcs uses a discrete model of time. Fuzzy ranges are not allowed. This is an efficiency measure to prevent branching in the reasoning at scheduling time. Variables must be declared to tcs.
