Abstract: Robot path planning algorithms for finding a goal in a unknown environment focus on completeness rather than optimality. In this paper, we investigate several strategies for using map information, however incomplete or approximate, to reduce the cost of the robots traverse. The strategies are based on optimistic, pessimistic, and a verage value assumptions about the unkno wn portions of the robots environment. The strategies were compared u s i n g r a n d o m l y generated f r a c t a l t e r r a i n environments. We determined that a verage value approximations work best across small re gions. In their absence, an optimistic strate gy explores the environment, and a pessimistic strate gy refines existing paths.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Path planning for mobile robots has been extensively studied in the robotics literature. Man y algorithms exist for determining an optimal path from a starting point to a goal point given complete information about the robot s environment <ref> [Latombe, 91] </ref>. If the robots environment is not fully known during the planning phase, se veral algorithms exist that use local sensing to find the goal.

Reference-contexts: If the robots prior map information is sparse or inaccurate, then too much time will be spent replanning in Step 2 for the approach to be viable. The D* algorithm (Dynamic A*) <ref> [Stentz, 94] </ref> w as developed to solve this computational problem. D* produces an optimal traverse by using incremental graph theory techniques to dramatically reduce the time required to replan. <p> This path changes frequently as more obstacles are discovered (see Figure 3). Finally, Figure 4 shows the entire traverse after the robot has reached the goal. The basic D* algorithm is described e xtensively in an earlier paper <ref> [Stentz, 94] </ref>. The w ork was extended to further improve the computational performance gi ven good focussing heuristics [Stentz, 95]. D* w as tested both in simulation and on an actual robot [Stentz and Hebert, 95].
