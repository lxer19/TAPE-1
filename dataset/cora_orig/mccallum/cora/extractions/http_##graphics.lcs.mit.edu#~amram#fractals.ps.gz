Abstract: Fractal image compression still suffers from a (sometimes very) high encoding time, depending on the approach being used. Here, we propose a new recursive algorithm based on Jacquin's general scheme. A numerical predicate is used for guessing which domain block may possibly match a given range block. For a simple predicate based on histograms comparison, dramatic accelerations of the encoding process have been measured: the speedup gains prove the interest of the method. An important advantage of our technique is that it is compatible with other acceleration techniques. Results on generic images are shown.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the main part of the research effort concerns the encoding step whose running time and quality determine the validity of the whole technique: the decoding process consists most of the time in iterating a simple numerical algorithm. Since Barnsley et al. <ref> [1] </ref> introduced the IFS theory as a new technique for image compression, major contributions have been brought to shift fractal encoding to a realistic level. Recent publications on the three major approaches are [2, 3, 4, 5]. Let us mention the review [6] as well.

There are two types of accelerating techniques: those which are lossless, i.e. which do not sacrifice any image quality for the sake of the speedup, such as [7, 8] or [9]; those which are not, such as [10], [11] or the present one.

According to Jacquin's scheme <ref> [16] </ref>, the image is divided into range blocks. For each range block, we find in the image a domain block twice as large that best matches the range block after size reduction (averaging), isometry and luminance affine transformation (see figure 1).
