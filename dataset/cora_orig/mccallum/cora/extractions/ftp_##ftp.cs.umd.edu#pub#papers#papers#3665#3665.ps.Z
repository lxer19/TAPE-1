Abstract: A useful starting point for designing advanced graphical user interfaces is the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra: Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. But this is only a starting point in trying to understand the rich and varied set of information visualizations that have been proposed in recent years. This paper offers a task by data type taxonomy with seven data types (1-, 2-, 3-dimensional data, temporal and multidimensional data, and tree and network data) and seven tasks (overview, zoom, filter, details-on-demand, relate, history, and extract).

Reference-contexts: Multidimensional: most relational and statistical databases are conveniently manipulated as multidimensional data in which items with n attributes become points in a n-dimensional space. The interface representation can be 2-dimensional scattergrams with each additional dimension controlled by a slider <ref> (Ahlberg and Shneiderman, 1994) </ref>. Buttons can used for attribute values when the cardinality is small, say less than ten. Tasks include finding patterns, clusters, correlations among pairs of variables, gaps, and outliers. <p> The technique of parallel coordinates is a clever innovation which makes some tasks easier, but takes practice for users to comprehend (Inselberg, 1985). Examples: The early HomeFinder developed dynamic queries and sliders for user-controlled visualization of multidimensional data (Williamson and Shneiderman, 1992). The successor FilmFinder refined the techniques <ref> (Ahlberg and Shneiderman, 1994) </ref> for starfield displays (zoomable, color coded, user-controlled scattergrams), and laid the basis for the commercial product Spotfire (Ahlberg and Wistrand, 1995). Extrapolations include the Aggregate Manipulator (Goldstein and Roth, 1994), movable filters (Fishkin and Stone, 1995), and Selective Dynamic Manipulation (Chuah et al., 1995). <p> In Spotfire, the details-on-demand window can contain HTML text with links to further information. Proc. Visual Languages 96 - 5 - September 1996 R e l a t e : View relationships among items. In the FilmFinder <ref> (Ahlberg and Shneiderman, 1994) </ref> users could select an attribute, such as the film's director, in the details-on-demand window and cause the director alphaslider to be reset to the director's name, thereby displaying only films by that director.

Reference-contexts: Another effort to visualize 1-dimensional data showed the attribute values of each thousands of item in a fixed-sized space using a scrollbar-like display called value bars (Chimera, 1992). Even greater compressions were accomplished in compact displays of tens of thousands of lines of program source code <ref> (SeeSoft, Eick et al., 1992) </ref> or textual documents (Document Lens, Robertson and Mackinlay, 1993; Information mural, Jerding and Stasko, 1995). 2 dimensional: planar or map data include geographic maps, floorplans, or newspaper layouts.

Reference-contexts: Navigating high resolution images of the human body is the challenge in the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human project (North et al., 1996). Some applications have attempted to present 3-dimensional versions of trees (Robertson et al., 1993), networks <ref> (Fairchild et al., 1988) </ref>, or elaborate desktops (Card et al., 1996). T e m p o r a l : time lines are widely used and vital enough for medical records, project management, or historical presentations to create a data type that is separate from 1-dimensional data. <p> Commercial packages can handle small networks or simple strategies such as Netmap's layout of nodes on a circle with links crisscrossing the central area. An ambitious 3-dimensional approach was an impressive early accomplishment <ref> (Fairchild et al., 1988) </ref>, and new interest in this topic has been spawned by attempts to visualize the World Wide Web (Andrews, 1995; Hendley et al., 1995). These seven data types reflect are an abstraction of the reality.

Reference-contexts: The overview contains a movable field-of-view box to control the contents of the detail view, allowing zoom factors of 3 to 30. Replication of this strategy with intermediate views enables users to reach larger zoom factors. Another popular approach is the fisheye strategy <ref> (Furnas, 1986) </ref> which has been applied most commonly for network browsing (Sarkar and Brown, 1994; Bartram et al., 1995). The fisheye distortion magnifies one or more areas of the display, but zoom factors in prototypes are limited to about 5.

Reference-contexts: A very satisfying way to zoom in is by pointing to a location and issuing a zooming command, usually by clicking on a mouse button for as long as the user wishes (Bederson and Hollan, 1993). Zooming in one dimension has proven useful in starfield displays <ref> (Jog and Shneiderman, 1995) </ref>. Filter: filter out uninteresting items. Dynamic queries applied to the items in the collection is one of the key ideas in information visualization (Ahlberg et al., 1992; Williamson and Shneiderman, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Frequent tasks include finding all events before, after, or during some time period or moment, plus the basic tasks.

LifeLines shows a youth history keyed to the needs of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice, but is intended to present medical patient histories as a compact overview with selectable items to get details-on-demand. <p> Similarly, in SDM (Chuah et al., 1995), users can select an item and then highlight items with similar attributes or in LifeLines <ref> (Plaisant et al., 1996) </ref> users can click on a medication and see the related visit report, prescription, and lab test. Designing user interface actions to specify which relationship is to be manifested is still a challenge.

History : Keep a history of actions to support undo, replay, and progressive refinement. It is rare that a single user action produces the desired outcome.

Some applications have attempted to present 3-dimensional versions of trees <ref> (Robertson et al., 1993) </ref>, networks (Fairchild et al., 1988), or elaborate desktops (Card et al., 1996). <p> Frequent tasks include finding all events before, after, or during some time period or moment, plus the basic tasks. Examples: Many project management tools exist, but novel visualizations of time include the perspective wall <ref> (Robertson et al., 1993) </ref> and LifeLines (Plaisant et al., 1996). LifeLines shows a youth history keyed to the needs of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice, but is intended to present medical patient histories as a compact overview with selectable items to get details-on-demand.

Reference-contexts: Examples: An early approach to dealing with large 1-dimensional data sets was the bifocal display which provided detailed information in the focus area and less information in the surrounding context area <ref> (Spence and Apperley, 1982) </ref>. In their example, the selected issue of a scientific journal had details about each article, the older and newer issues of the journal were to the left and right on the bookshelf with decreasing space.

Reference-contexts: Related works include VisDB for multidimensional database visualization (Keim and Kreigal, 1994), the spreadsheet-like Table Lens (Rao and Card, 1994) and the multiple linked histograms in the Influence Explorer <ref> (Tweedie et al., 1996) </ref>. Tree: hierarchies or tree structures are collections of items with each item having a link to one parent item (except the root). Items and the links between parent and child can have multiple attributes. <p> Designing user interface actions to specify which relationship is to be manifested is still a challenge. The Influence Explorer <ref> (Tweedie et al., 1996) </ref> emphasizes exploration of relationships among attributes. and the Table Lens emphasizes finding correlations among pairs of numerical attributes (Rao and Card, 1994). History : Keep a history of actions to support undo, replay, and progressive refinement.

Reference-contexts: The technique of parallel coordinates is a clever innovation which makes some tasks easier, but takes practice for users to comprehend (Inselberg, 1985). Examples: The early HomeFinder developed dynamic queries and sliders for user-controlled visualization of multidimensional data <ref> (Williamson and Shneiderman, 1992) </ref>. The successor FilmFinder refined the techniques (Ahlberg and Shneiderman, 1994) for starfield displays (zoomable, color coded, user-controlled scattergrams), and laid the basis for the commercial product Spotfire (Ahlberg and Wistrand, 1995).

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Information exploration should be a joyous experience, but many commentators talk of information overload and anxiety <ref> (Wurman, 1989) </ref>. However, there is promising evidence that the next generation of digital libraries for structured databases, textual documents, and multimedia will enable convenient exploration of growing information spaces by a wider range of users.

Reference-contexts: Our approach was to apply the metaphor of water flowing from left to right through a series of pipes and filters, where each filter lets through only the appropriate documents, and the pipe layout indicates relationships of AND or OR. <ref> (Young and Shneiderman, 1993) </ref> In this filterflow model, ANDs are shown as a linear sequence of filters, suggesting the successive application of required criteria. As the flow passes through each filter, it is reduced, and the visual feedback shows a narrower bluish stream of water.
