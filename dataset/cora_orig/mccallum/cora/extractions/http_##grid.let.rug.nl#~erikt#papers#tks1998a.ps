Abstract: The World Wide Web (WWW) is an interesting medium for CALL material because it solves the portability and reusability problems of recent CALL systems. However developing WWW CALL material is hard because of the required document encoding and programming knowledge and the large amount of encoding work that is necessary. This paper describes the program CATCH which can be used for overcoming these barriers. CATCH converts small descriptions of CALL exercises to working HTML files which contain JavaScript software. It allows CALL developers to develop WWW teaching material in an easier and faster way.

Reference-contexts: This solves portability problems and opens the possibility for using the CALL material longer than until the next software or hardware update 2 . 1 The program CATCH is available at http://stp.ling.uu.se/~erikt/catch/ 2 Reusability of CALL material is a big problem according to <ref> [Lev97] </ref>. CALL material is often discarded at the next software or hardware update. 1 2 Educational methods in CALL In this section we will present a basic collection of educational methods that can be used in CALL material.

Reference-contexts: In that case it is possible for the CALL developer to define useful feedback for these predefined answers. The answer set will benefit from an evaluation of the answers given by the students while using the CALL material <ref> [Sar98] </ref>. It is therefore desirable that CALL software is able to store the unforeseen answers of students so that they be evaluated by its developers. Apart from general help facilities about program usage CALL software needs special aids for students. The most important of these is a searchable online dictionary. <p> Currently the program is being used in a five-point CALL course for developing material for Spanish and Russian. In this course we are cooperating with a professional language teacher. We have received many interesting recommendations from both her <ref> [Sar98] </ref> and the students [Ahl98].

Reference-contexts: Two advantages of exercises with automatical answer checking are the possibility for testing students from one group on different topics simultaneously and the opportunity for discovering students which problems immediately without a large investment of time by a human teacher <ref> [Sci95] </ref>. It is hard to overestimate the importance of exercises for CALL material. Exercises can be characterized by four features: Exercise features: Purpose: practice and test. Task: translation, question answering and gap filling. Format: text, speech and images. Input format: text, speech and multiple-choice answers. <p> Developers of CALL material are interested in finding out which exercises will help increasing the language level of the students in the best way. A.G. Sciarone has provided some interesting answers to this question for the topic of text understanding <ref> [Sci95] </ref>. The language level of second language learning students can be increased by making them spend more time on reading written texts and listening to spoken material. Students will spend more time on these tasks if they perform tests with obligatory result levels regularly. <p> Students will spend more time on these tasks if they perform tests with obligatory result levels regularly. Dictation exercises are the best method for testing listening capabilities and gap filling is the best exercise task for testing text understanding <ref> [Sci95] </ref> 3 . 2.2 Feedback and help CALL software reacts to input of students by providing feedback. In order for the feedback to be useful the CALL system should be able to recognize and classify the input. This is one of the most challenging tasks for developers of CALL material. <p> His conclusion was that multiple-choice exercises allowed too much guessing, answers on questions are too hard to check for the available computational linguistics technology while gap filling exercises provide both good testing facilities and allow checking answers with the available technology <ref> [Sci95] </ref>. 4 An example of a language learning evaluation task which seems impossible for a CALL system with the present technology is testing the communicational capabilities of language learning students.

Reference-contexts: This is one of the most challenging tasks for developers of CALL material. Too often language teachers that evaluate CALL programs complain that a student has given a correct answer to a question but that the computer has failed to recognize it <ref> [vdL97] </ref>. The problem here is that computer software is unable to understand human language. A consideration of the position of CALL in language education is necessary here. CALL systems are not being used for replacing human teachers but as an extra tool for aiding their work.
