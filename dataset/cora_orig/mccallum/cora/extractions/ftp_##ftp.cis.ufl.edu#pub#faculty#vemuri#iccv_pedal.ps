Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric shape modeling scheme which allows for representation of global and local shape characteristics of an object. Geometric models are traditionally well suited for representing global shapes but not the local details. However, in this paper we propose a powerful geometric shape modeling scheme which allows for the representation of global shapes with local detail and permits model shaping as well as topological changes via physics-based control. The proposed modeling scheme consists of representing shapes by pedal curves and surfaces pedal curves/surfaces are the loci of the foot of perpendiculars to the tangents of a fixed curve/surface from a fixed point called the pedal point. By varying the location of the pedal point, one can synthesize a large class of shapes which exhibit both local and global deformations. We introduce physics-based control for shaping these geometric models by letting the pedal point vary and use a dynamic spline to represent the position of this varying pedal point. The model dubbed as a "snake pedal" allows for interactive manipulation via forces applied to the snake. We demonstrate the applicability of this modeling scheme via examples of shape synthesis and shape estimation from real image data.

The generator can be either a parameterized or an implicit function representing a curve. <p> Note the variety of local deformations that can be generated using this modeling technique. We remind the reader that the snake pedal itself is a geometric model and that it is not directly responsive to the application of external forces unlike the standard snake models <ref> [5] </ref>. Also, it is easy to synthesize (a) (b) (c) generator and a snake.

Reference-contexts: The fitting involves estimating the snake as well as the global parameters of the snake pedal model. The model fitting is posed as a nonlinear minimization and we use the Lavenberg-Marquad nonlinear optimization algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> to achieve the fitting. To fit the snake pedal to a given data set of n points D i in 3D, we minimize the sum of the squared distances from the data points D i to the corresponding closest points x i on the pedal curve/surface. <p> For details of the LM algorithm description, we refer the reader to <ref> [9] </ref>. For the derivative of the energy required in the LM al gorithm, we use the chain rule to get @E @q = ( @E @q ).
