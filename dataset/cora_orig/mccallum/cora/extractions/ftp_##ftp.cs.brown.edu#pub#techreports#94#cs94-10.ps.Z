Reference-contexts: Di Battista, Liu, and Rival [7] shown that every planar bipartite 1 digraph is upward planar. Bertolazzi, Di Battista, Liotta, and Mannino <ref> [1, 2] </ref> give a polynomial--time algorithm for testing upward planarity of triconnected digraphs and digraphs with a fixed embedding.

Reference-contexts: Concerning single-source digraphs, Thomassen [22] characterizes upward planarity in terms of forbidden circuits. Hutton and Lubiw [10] combine Thomassen's characterization with a decomposition scheme to test upward planarity of a single-source digraph in O (n 2 ) time. Berto-lazzi, Di Battista, Mannino, and Tamassia <ref> [3] </ref> show that upward planarity testing of a single-source digraph can be done optimally in O (n) time. They also give a parallel algorithm that runs in O (log n) time on a CRCW PRAM with n log log n= log n processors.

Reference-contexts: Research on graph drawing has been especially active in the last decade. The latest version of the annotated bibliography on graph drawing algorithms, by G. Di Battista, P. Eades, R. Tamassia and I.G. Tollis [5] lists more than 300 papers, and the Graph Drawing '93 workshop <ref> [4] </ref> gathered 80 scientists from 19 countries. Various graphic standards have been proposed for the representation of graphs in the plane. Usually, vertices are represented by points, and each edge (u; v) is represented by a simple open Jordan curve joining the points associated with the vertices u and v.
