Abstract: In the classical computer-graphics approach to three-dimensional rendering, a scene is described in terms of its geometry and surface properties. Given this representation, the rendering task can be thought of as a physical simulation problem. Recently, there has been an increased interest in alternate rendering paradigms, most of which fall into a category that we call image-based rendering. In these alternate approaches, reference images, rather than geometry and surface properties, are used as the primary scene description. In this paper we describe a simple extension to the well known results of projective geometry, resulting in an efficient foundation for the construction of image-based rendering systems. The fact that all planar projections of a given three-dimensional planar surface are related by two-dimensional homogeneous transforms, known as perspective mappings, is an important result of projective geometry. While the three-dimensional projection process defines mappings from R 3 fi R 2 , these two-dimensional homogeneous relationships define transformations from R 2 fi R 2 , where the domains and ranges are in the images coordinate systems. These perspective mappings can be easily expressed in matrix form as shown below: By setting g and h to zero, we can see that two-dimensional affine mappings are a proper subset of the perspective case. Mann and Picard [Mann94] have also shown how all planar projections about a common center of projection are related by perspective mappings. where
