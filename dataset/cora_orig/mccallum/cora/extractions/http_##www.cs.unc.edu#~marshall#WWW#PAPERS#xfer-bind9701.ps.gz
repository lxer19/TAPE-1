Abstract: How can a visual system or cognitive system use the changing relationships between moving visual elements to decide which elements belong together as groups (or objects)? We have constructed a neural circuit model that selects object groupings based on global Gestalt common-fate evidence and uses information about the behavior of each group to predict the behavior of elements of the group. A simple competitive neural circuit binds elements into a representation of an object. Information about the spiking pattern of neurons allows transfer of the bindings of an object representation from location to location in the neural circuit as the object moves. The model exhibits characteristics of human object grouping and solves some key neural circuit design problems in visual relative motion perception.
