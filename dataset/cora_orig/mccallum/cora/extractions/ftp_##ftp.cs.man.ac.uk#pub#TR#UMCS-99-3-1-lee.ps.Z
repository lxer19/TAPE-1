Abstract: This paper presents a series of experiments with an autonomous mobile robot to acquire a model of the robot's interaction with a specific environment. In these experiments, an artificial neural network model of the environment is acquired, using data obtained from the robot interacting with the real world. To investigate the feasibility of this approach we have modelled fundamental sensory perception, robot environment interaction in simple, small environments, and the application of this novel approach to a machine learning application in robotics. The behaviour of a learning mobile robot is predicted using our network-based approach and shown to produce more faithful results than classical robot simulation methods.
