Reference-contexts: In order to see that Theorem 2 holds recall that the satisfiability problem for the monadic theory of real order is undecidable [6]. On the other hand, the satisfiability problem is decidable over the natural numbers <ref> [1] </ref>. Now observe that if OE is a sentence, then it is satisfiable over the reals iff OE^X ae A defines (in N with the reals at the background) the family of all point-sets on the natural numbers.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the translation cannot be recursive. The proof of the if direction of Theorem 1 will be based on the composition theorem <ref> [6, 2] </ref>. The composition theorem is a very powerful theorem for the proofs of decidability of various theories [6, 3]. Here is the first application of the composition theorem to definability. The method of interpretation is also used extensively in our proof.

Reference-contexts: oe 1 ) _ : : : _ (Y (t 1 ) = oe k ^ Y (t) = oe k ). 2.3 Method of Interpretation The following theorem is immediately obtained by interpreting a subchain A of B in the chain B augmented by a unary predicate A (see <ref> [5] </ref> for the detailed description of the methods of interpretation). Theorem 5 Let B = hB; &lt;i be a chain and A = hA; &lt;i be a subchain of B.

In Section 2 we fix notations and terminology, state some preliminary results and provide a formulation of the composition theorem which is needed later. This version of the composition theorem is weaker than the version in <ref> [6] </ref>, however, its formulation is simple. We recall also the method of interpretation and show the easy direction of Theorem 1. In Section 3 Theorem 1 is proved. <p> Note that the requirement that OE 1 ; : : : ; OE k is a partition guarantees that Q is well defined. The following theorem is a weak version of Composition Theorem (Shelah <ref> [6] </ref>). Its proof will be sketched in the Appendix.

Reference-contexts: The language (of this variant) of monadic 4 second-order theory of order (see e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>) has two types of variables: (1) first--order (or individual) variables, and (2) -predicate (or -color) variables for each finite non-empty set . The letter t with subscripts and superscripts ranges over individual variables; and upper-case case Latin letters are used for predicate variables.
