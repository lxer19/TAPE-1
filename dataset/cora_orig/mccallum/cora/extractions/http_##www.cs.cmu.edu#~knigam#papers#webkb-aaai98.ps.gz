Abstract: The World Wide Web is a vast source of information accessible to computers, but understandable only to humans. The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system.

Reference-contexts: We discuss each of these tasks in the main sections of the paper. Addi--tional details concerning the methods and experiments described in this paper can be found elsewhere <ref> (Craven et al. 1998) </ref>. After describing approaches to these three tasks, we describe experiments with a system that incorporates learned classifiers for each task. Experimental Testbed As a testbed for our initial research, we have investigated the task of building a knowledge base describing computer science departments. <p> Related Work Our work builds on related research in several fields, including text classification (e.g. Lewis et al., 1996), information extraction (e.g. Soderland, 1996), and Web agents (e.g. Shakes & Etzioni, 1996). Space limitations preclude us from describing this work in detail; the interested reader is referred elsewhere <ref> (Craven et al. 1998) </ref> for a comprehensive discussion of related work. Conclusions We began with the question of how to automatically create a computer-understandable world-wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we consider the task of learning to classify pages using an algorithm that is able to induce first-order rules. The learning algorithm that we use in this section is Foil <ref> (Quinlan & Cameron-Jones 1993) </ref>. Foil is a greedy covering algorithm for learning function-free Horn clauses.
