Abstract: The discussion above included only some of the items on the project outline. Due to time constraints and overly optimistic estimations of what was feasible to do, the other items were not completed. These include predication of short-circuit constructs, IA32 code generation from MIR, and benchmarking of the generated code. In addition to those items, other optimizations are enhanced by predication and would be interesting for future work. Among these are more opportunities for instruction merging ([3]) and code hoisting, along with instruction scheduling. [1] Steven S. Muchnick, Advanced Compiler Design and Implementation.
