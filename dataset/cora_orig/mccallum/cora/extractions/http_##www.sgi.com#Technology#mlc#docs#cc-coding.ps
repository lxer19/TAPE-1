Reference-contexts: The conventions established here are designed to make the code more readable and more reliable. Every rule has exceptions, but deviations from the standards should be documented in the code and explained. This document used to be longer, but it got shorter because of Meyer's book <ref> (Meyers 1994) </ref>. Please read this book ASAP. His second book (Meyers 1996) is less basic and not as important initially (although still highly recommended). h Annotations are enclosed in brackets and printed in a small font.

Reference-contexts: Arguments should be self describing (e.g., int [ ] is bad). They should not rely on other arguments to give their length, size, etc., as this is a sign that the abstraction level is too low <ref> (Stroustrup 1991, page 426) </ref>. 5. Functions that are written to help the implementation of a class should be defined as "static" (their scope is the file scope), or they should be made private members. 2 4 If you find yourself repeating code, this is often a good solution.
