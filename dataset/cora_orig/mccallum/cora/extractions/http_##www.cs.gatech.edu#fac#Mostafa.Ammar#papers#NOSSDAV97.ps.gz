Abstract: This paper proposes a novel scheme for distributing MPEG-coded video over a best-effort heterogeneous network, such as the Internet. The key contributions of the proposed scheme are (1)error recovery using smart retransmissions and adaptive playback point, and (2) dynamic adjustment of video reception rate at the receivers using a hierarchical control mechanism. This paper focuses on the first feature. The protocols are developed on the Internet and performance of the system has been measured on the Mbone. Some results from the measurement are presented and evaluated in this paper.

Reference-contexts: IP-multicast is a mechanism which, by virtue of using Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [D89], and a multicast routing protocol, such as, Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [D88] [DC90], or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) [DEF+94] or Core-Based Tree (CBT) <ref> [BFC93] </ref>, sets up a multicast tree spanning all receivers. The multicast tree is defined by the IP-address of the sender and a Class-D IP-address of the group. Receivers can dynamically join and leave a multicast group, thereby leading to the dynamic reconfiguration of the multicast tree.

Reference-contexts: The main components of LVMR are hierarchical distributed control for video layer reception determination and retransmission-based error recovery. There have been two principal approaches to solve the rate control problem in video multicast: sender-initiated control <ref> [BTW94] </ref> and receiver-initiated control [MJ96]. In the sender-initiated approach, the sender multicasts a single video stream whose quality is adjusted based on feedback information from receivers.

Reference-contexts: This scheme is "receiver-initiated " in the sense that a receiver decides on its own whether to drop an enhancement layer or to add one. There are also hybrid approaches like <ref> [CAL96] </ref> in which the intra-stream protocol is sender-initiated, while the inter-stream protocol is receiver-initiated. In LVMR, we propose to solve the heterogeneity problem by using a layered video coding approach, as in [MJ96]. <p> Layered multicasts provide a finer granularity of control compared to using a single video stream, because a receiver may subscribe to one, two, or more layers depending on its capabilities, and, unlike in the scheme in <ref> [CAL96] </ref>, does not increase the bandwidth requirement because the layers are disjoint. If a receiver experiences packet loss as a result of congestion, dropping one or more layers will reduce congestion, and hence will reduce potential packet loss. <p> Such results are used in the above state condition checking. Considering the packet loss rate r, we can set benchmark similar to <ref> [CAL96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Further improvement can be obtained by intelligently retransmitting lost packets within the layers that are currently active. Our system is built with a modified version of RMTP [LP96] [PSLB96] as the transport layer protocol. As in <ref> [DLW93] </ref>, our protocols also deploy the feasibility of retransmission with extended control time in playback point schemes. <p> Later in Step 3, we will define a new scheme of adapting playback points, and that is what we usually refer to when the term "adap-tive playback" is used in this paper, unless otherwise specified. Step 2: Playback point with extended control time. As in <ref> [DLW93] </ref>, control time is defined as the duration between the arrival instant and playback point of the first frame. <p> A retransmission is effective, i.e., the retransmitted packet arrives before the playback point, if ffi t l + rtt + t r , (unless the retransmission request or the retransmit-ted packet is lost). The authors in <ref> [DLW93] </ref> observed that extended control time makes retransmission feasible for interactive packetized voice traffic over local networks, and our experiments also show that this scheme makes retransmission effective for non-interactive realtime video multicast over a wide area network. The results are in Section 5. Step 3: Adaptive playback point.

Reference-contexts: Details of the states and transition conditions are discussed later in this section. The learning adaptation provides enhancement to the basic state transition. It adjusts certain control parameters by utilizing the "lessons" learned during early experience. As Li and Ammar pointed out in <ref> [LA96] </ref>, such adaptation helps to decrease oscillation in layer change. The hierarchical control protocol makes rate control more efficient in a multicast environment with some simple communication and collaboration among the receivers.

RMTP provides sequenced, lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of receivers. It uses a receiver-driven approach and receivers achieve reliability by using a packet-based selective repeat retransmission scheme. A receiver periodically generates acknowledgment (ACK) reflecting what data packets it has correctly received.

In RLM [MJ96], a fully distributed approach is advocated in which a 1 receiver, by itself, makes decisions to add or drop an enhancement layer. This decision is enhanced by a "shared learning" process in which information from experiments conducted by other receivers is used to improve performance. <p> In LVMR, we take a hierarchical approach in the receivers' dynamic rate control schemes, so as to allow receivers to maintain minimal state information and decrease control traffic on the multicast session. It also provides more functionality compared to the simple receiver-driven schemes, as in RLM <ref> [MJ96] </ref>. In particular, it allows multiple experiments to be conducted simultaneously, and also helps drop the correct layer (s) during congestion in most cases, which are not possible in RLM because of its completely distributed approach.

Reference-contexts: Estimation of should be dynamically adjusted according to the variation of network delays, and thus playback points are adapted accordingly. Our work does not focus on this adaptation, and we will only apply schemes already proposed by other researchers (e.g. <ref> [RKT+94] </ref>) to handle this problem in our prototype system implementation. Later in Step 3, we will define a new scheme of adapting playback points, and that is what we usually refer to when the term "adap-tive playback" is used in this paper, unless otherwise specified.

RSVP <ref> [ZDE+93] </ref> will allow applications at the end-hosts to interact with the network layer by requesting resources for a certain QOS guarantee.
