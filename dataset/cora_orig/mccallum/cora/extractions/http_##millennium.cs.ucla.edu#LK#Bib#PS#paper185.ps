Title: CCR-4/95 NOMADIC COMPUTING AN OPPORTUNITY  
Author: by Leonard Kleinrock 
Affiliation: Chairman, Computer Science Department UCLA  
Abstract: We are in the midst of some truly revolutionary changes in the field of computer-communications, and these offer opportunities and challenges to the research community. One of these changes has to do with nomadic computing and communications. Nomadicity refers to the system support needed to provide a rich set of capabilities and services to the nomad as he moves from place to place in a transparent and convenient form. This new paradigm is already manifesting itself as users travel to many different locations with laptops, PDA's, cellular telephones, pagers, etc. In this paper we discuss some of the open issues that must be addressed as we bring about the system support necessary for nomadicity. In addition, we present some of the considerations with which one must be concerned in the area of wireless communications, which forms one (and only one) component of nomadicity.

Reference-contexts: the role of government in these matters? What are the opportunities and responsibilities of our profession? We choose not to dwell any further on this here, but refer the reader for a discussion of these and many related issues to a report released last year by the National Research Council <ref> [1] </ref>. What is noteworthy is that we are in the midst of some very significant changes in many aspects of information technology, and these changes reach far beyond the purely technical aspects of our profession.

Reference-contexts: by wireless communication media varies over an enormous range as does the wireline network bandwidth, the nature of the error rate, fading behavior, interference level, mobility issues etc., for wireless are considerably different so that the algorithms and protocols require some new and different forms from that of wireline networks <ref> [3] </ref>. The cellular radio networks that are so prevalent today have an architecture that assumes the existence of a cell base station for each cell of the array; the base station controls the activity of its cell.

Reference-contexts: The design considerations of such cellular networks are reasonably well understood and are being addressed by an entire industry <ref> [5] </ref>. We discuss these no further in this paper. 4 There is however, another wireless networking architecture of interest which assumes no base stations [2,6]. Such wireless networks are useful for applications that require instant infrastructure, among others.
