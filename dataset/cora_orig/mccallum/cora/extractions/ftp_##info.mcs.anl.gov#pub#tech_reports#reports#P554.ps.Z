Abstract: Orders-of-magnitude enhancements of persistent currents J are reported in Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7ffi with columnar defects arranged in a variety of splayed configurations. The largest J is obtained for a planar distribution P pl (fi), with a splay angle fi opt = 5 ffi . A comparison of P pl (fi) and a gaussian distribution P G (fi), suggests that pinning by the latter is controlled by large-angle tails of the gaussian, which appear to enhance thermal creep rate.

Reference-contexts: Numerical simu lations confirm the existence of the regimes where vortex motion is promoted rather than suppressed by splay. 1 Pinning of magnetic vortices in the mixed state of a type-II superconductor is unarguably optimized with linear defects <ref> [1] </ref>. In cuprate superconductors, an effective defect structure, consisting of a random array of nearly parallel columns of amorphized material, 50 80 A in diameter, can be installed by the irradiation with swift ( GeV ) heavy ions, such as Pb, Sn, or Au [2,3]. <p> A single flux line was then parameterized by a set of two-dimensional vectors, r (z), which lie in a plane ? ^z. The total free energy of the flux line is given by <ref> [1] </ref>: F = 0 2 dz + U p (r (z); z) F r (z) 5 : (1) Here " ffi is the flux line tilt modulus, U p (r (z); z) is an attractive pinning potential due to columnar pins of arbitrary orientation, and F is an external force. <p> The log-log plot of v vs F is well described by v / exp (const=F ), characteristic of the glassy vortex motion <ref> [1] </ref>. The upper inset shows exponents for k defects and for the 10 ffi planar splay. For parallel pins = 0:8 0:2, in good agreement with the predicted value = 1 for the half-loop vortex creep regime [4]. <p> Note that even the simplest cases of creep of an individual vortex line or a dislocation [16] reveal very complicated non-linear and non-additive nature of the competition between kink nucleation and kink pinning. In finite magnetic fields, when vortex-vortex interactions are relevant <ref> [1] </ref>, the outcome will non-trivially depend on temperature, time, and B . In particular, the creep energy barriers and J c may not be directly related, as reflected in our data. In conclusion, our results clearly establish that very large current enhancement can be obtained with splayed columnar defects.

Such shape difference was seen in M (H) for H k defects and H misaligned with defects by a large (60 ffi ) angle in the experiment of Civale et al. <ref> [2] </ref> (Fig. 3 inset). The effect on vortex dynamics is shown in Fig. 3 (b), which contrasts the thermal relaxation rates S = dlnJ=dlnt for the gaussian, the 5 ffi , and the k pin configurations. <p> For k pins and 5 ffi splay the creep rates are comparable. The data in Fig. 3 suggest similar dominant pinning mechanism for the large-angle 4 defect-field misalignment in Civale's experiment <ref> [2] </ref> and for the gaussian splay. Namely, pinning of the kinks [14] generated either by the vortex-defect [2,15] or defect-defect intersections.

It is important to note that = 1:4 0:2 for the 10 ffi splay implies that at sufficiently small driving forces the velocity through the 10 ffi splay will become less than in the system with parallel pins [18].

Reference-contexts: Recently, we have established the effectiveness of the uniform splay which can be installed with fission in a quasi-2D Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ffi (BSCCO), a structure of possible technological 2 relevance <ref> [7] </ref>.

Yet, the optimal pinning configuration for a 3D material is still to be found. Here, we report orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the persistent current density, J , in irradiated YBCO crystals for several controlled splay configurations of columnar defects, exceeding J for the parallel tracks.

Reference-contexts: Faster dynamics at large fi is confirmed in numerical simulations. Several YBCO crystals of 1mm size and 15 to 20m thick along the c axis, were irradiated with 1:08GeV 197 Au 23+ at the TASCC facility at Chalk River Laboratories in Canada <ref> [9] </ref>. To install planar splay, the ion beam was tilted off the c (^z) axis by rocking the crystals about an axis ? ^z (as sketched in Fig. 1) by fi in a range from 2:5 ffi to 15 ffi . <p> At the same time the strong pinning range is nearly intact. Both the k and 5 ffi pins shift the irreversibility line, H irr , towards high temperatures in a predictable way <ref> [9] </ref>, as shown in the upper inset of Fig. 2. A slight downward displacement of H irr (T ) for the 5 ffi splay, relative to P k , is expected from the decrease of glass melting temperature due to the average tilt [5].

Reference-contexts: Gaussian splay was obtained by irradiating 15m thick crystals through a 5m thick Au foil. The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of P G (fi) was estimated from the TRIM Monte Carlo calculations [8,10]. The ion energy was 0:6GeV at the entrance to crystals, setting the projected range at 21m <ref> [10] </ref>. The energy deposition rate was above the threshold for columnar track formation (1:8KeV = A) throughout the crystal thickness [8,10,11].

Reference-contexts: S (H; T ) was obtained from the time evolution of M (H; T; t) from the critical state for times 60 &lt; t &lt; 7200sec <ref> [13] </ref>. Below H 1:5T and outside a narrow region near H = 0, the creep rate is faster for the gaussian splay it is 0:026 at H 0:25T , as compared with 0:018 for a 5 ffi arrangement. For k pins and 5 ffi splay the creep rates are comparable.

Reference-contexts: We simulated single-vortex motion through the system of columnar defects parallel to magnetic field and through the families of 10 ffi and 45 ffi planar splay configurations of identical randomly positioned columnar pins.

Each vertical line segment was randomly kicked (in turn) with the variation in energy ffiF for each kick calculated with Eq. (1). Any step which decreased F was automatically accepted, while a step that increased F had a probability P = exp (ffiF=T ) of being accepted.
