Abstract: Designing the illumination of a scene is a difficult task because one needs to render the whole scene in order to look at the result. Obtaining the correct lighting effects may require a long sequence of modeling/rendering steps. We propose to use directly the highlights and shadows in the modeling process. By creating and altering these lighting effects, the lights themselves are indirectly modified. We believe this new technique to design lighting is more intuitive and can lead to a reduction of the number of modeling/rendering steps required to obtain the desired image.

Reference-contexts: While the two processes might seem to go on totally opposite directions, it is interesting to consider how advances in one direction might actually help the reverse process. In computer vision, highlight information has been used to determine light direction or local shape orientation. Babu et al. <ref> [babu85] </ref> study contours of constant intensity in an image to determine the orientation of planar surfaces under the illumination of a directional light source. Buchanan [buch87] fits ellipses to the highlights to obtain the same information for planar surfaces illuminated by point light sources.

For extended light sources (linear, polygonal), the shadow volume is the 3D volume within which every point is at least partly in shadow of this object. light source volume. The point on the object casting this shadow is then identified.

Reference-contexts: Its advantages are demonstrated and its restrictions explained so one could better understand the implications of using such a process. Highlights are usually defined in the reflection models by the specular term. Consider the specular term of Phong's shading [phon75] as expressed by Blinn <ref> [blin77] </ref>: n where ~ N is the surface normal at a given point 1 ~ H is the bisector vector of the eye direction and the light direction n is the surface roughness coefficient.

Reference-contexts: The shadow volume created by an object illuminated by a directional light source consists of a sweep of the object silhouette in the direction the light source shines. This silhouette can be analytically determined for simple primitives, computed for moderately complicated objects with algorithms like in <ref> [bonf86] </ref>, sampled by studying the variation of surface normals at the vertices of a tessellated object or sampled using the information in a z-buffer projection of this object. Specifying the direction of a directional light is simply a question of choosing two arbitrary, although different, points in the scene.

Reference-contexts: This process could also be improved by using a different data structure that might be more suitable for faster intersections of half planes defined by the shadow quadrilaterals. In object space, the binary space subdivision algorithm handling shadow volumes as presented by Chin and Feiner <ref> [chin89] </ref> would be a good candidate to investigate, while in screen space the algorithm described by Fournier and Fussell [four88] could be of use. 3 Results A very simple modeler has been implemented in order to test the techniques presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Detecting shadows can be done in a similar way than edge detection by applying various edge enhancing filters. For extended lights, the shadow edges are soft and the shadow must be detected based on changes in the gradients of the shading. Gershon <ref> [gers87] </ref> use gradients in color space to determine if the region corresponds to a shadow region or simply to a change of material. Textures can also defeat most of the techniques and must be carefully handled.

Reference-contexts: Shadows of extended light sources are formed by the umbra and penumbra regions. The whole shadow region is defined by the convolution of the object and the light source in the projection domain <ref> [guib83] </ref>. The umbra is defined by the intersection of each shadow volume (one shadow volume per light vertex); the penumbra is the difference between the whole shadow and the umbra.

Reference-contexts: Yesterday's simple wireframe models can now be replaced by flat shaded polygons, Gouraud shaded and even Phong shaded polygons, allowing for real time interaction with the models. Hanrahan and Haeberli <ref> [hanr90] </ref> demonstrate with their system how today's graphics hardware could be used to "paint" textures and various other surface parameters (transparency, perturbation of surface normals, etc.) in a fully interactive system. <p> It is interesting to note that other points on the surface might reach this maximum but will never surpass it. This simple relationship between the maximum intensity of the highlight and light direction has been used in the past. Hanrahan and Haeberli <ref> [hanr90] </ref> mention how they can specify a light direction by dragging a highlight on a sphere.

Reference-contexts: Buchanan [buch87] fits ellipses to the highlights to obtain the same information for planar surfaces illuminated by point light sources. One important aspect of most of these algorithms consists in identifying the highlight area. This is not an easy task as many of the algorithms for shape from shading <ref> [horn88] </ref> require almost entirely diffuse surfaces. When techniques are not restricted to diffuse surfaces, they often rely on some kind of thresholding. The unfortunate reality with thresholding is that different values of threshold can lead to relatively different shape of the highlight and therefore, to different shape/light recovery.

Reference-contexts: The umbra is defined by the intersection of each shadow volume (one shadow volume per light vertex); the penumbra is the difference between the whole shadow and the umbra. Nishita et al. <ref> [nish83] </ref> studied the various parts of these shadow regions in 2D, once projected onto polygonal surfaces for shadow culling purposes. Some problems occur when neither the object casting the shadow or the light are limited to being convex.

Reference-contexts: To represent highlights created by extended light sources, the contribution of each vertex of the light is not sufficient to determine the shape of the complete highlight. To display this information, the boundary fill algorithm would have to compute the specular integral for a linear light <ref> [poul91] </ref> or a polygonal light [tana91] for each pixel to visit. Such integrals are rather expensive to compute and in order to achieve real time, cheaper approximations based on precomputed tables could be of some use here.

Reference-contexts: However some improvements can be obtained by first projecting the shadow quadrilateral onto the plane containing the convex hull on the 2D projection plane. Since we use Graham's 2D convex hull algorithm <ref> [sedg90] </ref>, the points of the shadow quadrilateral, once projected in 2D, are converted in pseudo angles and an efficient combination of angle comparisons and boxing allows for faster intersection culling.
