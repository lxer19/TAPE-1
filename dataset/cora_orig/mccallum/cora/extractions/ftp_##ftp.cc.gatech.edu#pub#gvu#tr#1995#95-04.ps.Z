Abstract: This paper describes a fast method of correcting for optical distortion in head-mounted displays (HMDs). Since the distorted display surface in an HMD is not rectilinear, the shape and location of the graphics window used with the display must be chosen carefully, and some corrections made to the predistortion model. A distortion correction might be performed with optics that reverse the distortion caused by HMD lenses, but such optics can be expensive and offer a correction for only one specific HMD. Integer incremental methods or a lookup table might be used to calculate the correction, but an I/O bottleneck makes this impractical in software. Instead, a texture map may be defined that approximates the required optical correction. Recent equipment advances allow undistorted images to be input into texture mapping hardware at interactive rates.

Reference-contexts: WHY BOTHER CORRECTING DISTORTION? In Sutherland's early HMD work [16, 17], distortion was not considered a pressing issue. More important was the realization of any sort of device that approximated "the ultimate display." Even later researchers such as Bryson <ref> [3] </ref>, after some experiments, have concluded that compensating for distortion takes too much time, and have moved on to other research issues. Psychophysical studies have shown that the human visual system can correct for displayed distortion [20]. <p> Early HMDs had horizontal binocular FOVs ranging to well over 100 degrees. But they paid a price for this immersive width: severe distortion and poor resolution. Indeed, the level of visual acuity provided by many of these HMDs fits the legal definition of blindness <ref> [3] </ref>. Recently, commercial HMD manufacturers have begun to sacrifice FOV in order to achieve greater resolutions and reduced distortion. Some new HMDs have FOVs in the range of 40 degrees.

Reference-contexts: Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the effect of radial distortion. Distortion introduces other complications as well. Because the edges of the HMD raster itself are distorted, using all of the available display space would require clipping to a curved graphics window. A slight misregistration is introduced into stereo pairs <ref> [11] </ref>. Also, since distortion changes the perceived shape and size of raster pixels, distortion can introduce a perceived blur, and complicate antialiasing. Distortion also has some beneficial side effects. Distorting the image increases field-of-view (FOV) slightly.

Reference-contexts: Finally, since the predistortion for the HMD being used is usually well-known, it might be more efficient to precalculate the relocation of each undistorted pixel into a table, if sufficient memory is available. Regan and Pose have implemented such an approach in hardware <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Because this approach would have a variable complexity dependent on world geometry, we call it the geometry-dependent approach. Rolland and Hopkins <ref> [13] </ref> are experimenting with a algorithm related to the geometry-dependent approach that uses a lookup table to predistort vertices. Rather than rendering predistorted edges, however, they minimize the edge distortion by subdividing large screen polygons and predistorting the new vertices.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, because the optics do not distort the center of the image, this FOV increase does not come at the expense of central image detail, where viewer attention is usually focused. However, most of an HMD's optical FOV increase is attributable to optical magnification, not distortion. Robinett and Rolland <ref> [14] </ref> have described an optical model for HMDs. Using this model, they were able to suggest a method of correcting for HMD distortion with a predistortion. Later, their colleague Gary Bishop implemented this method on Pixel Planes hardware [6].

Reference-contexts: Until recently, it was not possible to load new textures into texturing hardware at interactive rates, and as a result, undistorted images could not be predistorted with this technique in real time. But a new and largely undocumented feature on high-end Silicon Graphics machines <ref> [15] </ref> has made this predistortion approach practical. Undistorted images can be rendered to the frame buffer and addressed directly by texturing hardware. We have implemented this technique on a Silicon Graphics Onyx Reality Engine II, and tested it on a virtual world containing 8211 flat shaded polygons.
