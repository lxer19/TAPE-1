Abstract: This paper explores a method of manipulating a planar rigid part on a conveyor belt using a robot with just one joint. This approach has the potential of offering a simple and flexible method for feeding parts in industrial automation applications. In this paper we develop a model of this system and of a variation which requires no sensing. We have been able to characterize these systems and to prove that they can serve as parts feeding devices for planar polygonal parts. We present the planners for these systems and describe our implementations.

Reference-contexts: A final tilt brings the part to one of the fence stops. Orienting a part with n stable edges takes O (n) stages, as can be shown using Goldberg's algorithm [34]. Since any polygon shares its push function with an infinite set of polygons (Akella and Mason <ref> [3] </ref>), a single plan can orient multiple non-similar parts that share the same push function. We use breadth-first search in the space of representative actions to find the shortest sequence of fence rotations to orient the part.

Reference-contexts: Rao, Goldberg, and Kriegman [57] used pivoting between fingers of a robot hand in order to control more degrees of freedom. By rolling an object between two parallel palms, Bicchi and Sorrentino <ref> [14] </ref> showed that the spatial position and orientation of the object can be controlled by as few as three motors. <p> Another variation for three-dimensional parts would be to use techniques similar to Bicchi and Sorrentino's <ref> [14] </ref> to roll parts on the conveyor. When addressing potential industrial applications, it is important to consider the whole system, including interactions with surrounding equipment.

Bowl feeders, APOS, and fixed fences all work by forcing the part to interact with shapes that are designed for the specific part. By contrast, 1JOC uses a generic shape (the fence) with a motion designed for the specific part.

Reference-contexts: Pushing and squeezing have been used to orient, position, or grasp parts (Mani and Wilson [45]; Brost [22]; Mason and Brost [49]; Peshkin and Sanderson [56]; Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref>; Akella and Mason [4]) and to plan motions to catch an object by pushing it (Brost [23]; Balorda [10]). 1.1.2 Parts Feeding Several parts feeding systems have already found success in industry. Boothroyd et al. [18] describe several. <p> Erdmann and Mason [33] used a tilting tray as a generic shape, and computed part-specific motions. Christiansen [27] applied machine learning to the tray tilting approach. Another method using generic shapes and part-specific motions is to squeeze a part with a parallel-jaw gripper. Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref> used a sequence of squeezing operations by a parallel-jaw gripper to orient parts. See van der Stappen et al. [64] for further analysis of orienting parts by grasping and by fences. <p> We show that any polygon can be transferred from a random initial configuration to a suitable goal configuration without sensing, up to symmetries in the push function. In this section we describe the sensorless 1JOC and its manipulation primitives. These primitives allow us to use Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [34] </ref> to prove that the sensorless 1JOC possesses the feeding property. 6.1 The Sensorless 1JOC Model The sensorless 1JOC is similar to the 1JOC with the following exceptions. The fence is frictionless with a stop at each end, and it is centered above the conveyor (Figure 12). <p> Viewed from a frame fixed in the conveyor, each catch is a linear normal push, meaning that the fence is pushing the part in a direction normal to the fence face. To determine the rotation of the part during a catch, we follow Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref> in using the radius function (Figure 14). The radius of a part is the perpendicular distance from a reference point in the part to a supporting line. <p> Each local minimum in the radius function determines a convergent orientation, and each local maximum determines a divergent orientation. Hence a normal push has the net effect of mapping the entire interval between two divergent orientations to the enclosed convergent orientation. The push function (Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref>), obtained from the radius function, is an alternative representation of the effect of a normal push. It is a mapping p : S 1 ! S 1 from the initial relative orientation of a part to the resulting orientation (Figure 15), and has a period of 2p. <p> Based on (Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref>). 6.2.3 Stable Pushes When the part is resting against the right (left) fence stop, a stable push allows the fence to rotate the part CCW (CW). The part remains fixed relative to the fence as it moves. <p> In this section we show that it is always possible to choose a pivot circle radius r, fence length, and ratio of the conveyor velocity v 24 relative orientations of the part. Based on (Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref>). indicate the convergent and divergent fence orientations respectively, and the circle indicates wraparound at 2p. are represented using moment-labeling regions (Mason [48]). <p> The fence can then rotate the part by any angle in the range (p; p) using a stable push. Each stable push is followed by a catch when the part drifts into contact with the fence. Goldberg <ref> [34] </ref> developed an algorithm that finds the shortest sequence of parallel-jaw grasps to orient any polygonal part up to symmetry. <p> A final tilt brings the part to one of the fence stops. Orienting a part with n stable edges takes O (n) stages, as can be shown using Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [34] </ref>. Since any polygon shares its push function with an infinite set of polygons (Akella and Mason [3]), a single plan can orient multiple non-similar parts that share the same push function.

Reference-contexts: For example, it is easy to show that all triangles are orientable using the angle range (p=2; p=2). There exist quadrilaterals, however, that cannot be oriented up to symmetry using this angle range. Goldberg and Overmars <ref> [35] </ref> showed that (p=2; p=2) is sufficient if parts possess no partial symmetriesthe distances from each stable angle to each edge of its convergence range are unique. 29 orientation.

Reference-contexts: For the start and goal configurations, we generate candidate edge transition sequences. For each such sequence, the corresponding objective function and constraints are input to a commercial nonlinear programming package called GINO (Liebman et al. <ref> [40] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The set of possible contact forces is given by the convex combination of the frictionless forces at each contact (Figure 18). For a set of contact forces, we can find a set of stable pushing motions using the algorithm described in (Lynch <ref> [41] </ref>). (This algorithm is more general than the procedure STABLE, which applies to a single line contact.) Figure 19 shows the CCW stable pushing motions V stable for the example of Figure 18.

Reference-contexts: work on manipulation by pushing, parts feeding, underactuated systems, and minimalism. 1.1.1 Manipulation by Pushing Our analysis of 1JOC is based on earlier work on the mechanics of pushing by Mason [47, 50]; Peshkin and Sanderson [55]; Goyal et al. [36, 37]; Alexander and Maddocks [5]; and Lynch and Mason <ref> [42, 43] </ref>. <p> When the part is at rest, the fence is executing a stable push. Of course, a stable push may also occur while the fence is rotating. Lynch and Mason <ref> [42] </ref> described the procedure STABLE that finds a conservative set of stable pushing directions V stable for a given pushing edge, pushing friction coefficient, and center of friction of the part. This set of pushing directions is fixed in the part frame F p . <p> For simplicity, we will only consider the edges of the part that yield a stable push while the fence is held at 0 degrees (the pushing direction is a translation normal to the edge). The existence of these stable edges is indicated by the following lemma (Lynch and Mason <ref> [42] </ref>): Lemma 1 All polygonal parts have at least one stable edge. For a stable edge, the normal translational pushing direction, along with a neighborhood of this pushing direction, belongs to V stable (because friction is nonzero).

Reference-contexts: A comparison of 1JOC and batting robots has prompted the observation that 1JOC juggles very slowly by using a conveyor instead of gravity. Arai and Khatib [7] used a paddle held by a PUMA robot to demonstrate rolling of an object on the paddle. More recently, Lynch and Mason <ref> [44] </ref> explored dynamic tasks such as snatching, rolling, throwing, and catching using a single degree-of-freedom arm working in the vertical plane. Brock [19] took advantage of gravity and contact with other objects to reorient objects within the hand using controlled slip.

For an introduction to nonlinear control see Nijmeijer and van der Schaft <ref> [53] </ref>. The 1JOC can be likened to an underactuated manipulator in a gravity field, where the proximal shoulder (fence pivot) is directly actuated, but the distal degrees of freedom (the object) are not. <p> The system therefore satisfies the Lie Algebra Rank Condition, and it is small-time accessible. If both the conveyor and the turntable are bidirectional (both v and w can be positive or negative), the system is also small-time locally controllable (Nijmeijer and van der Schaft <ref> [53] </ref>). If either or both is unidirectional, the system is not small-time locally controllable, but it can be shown to be controllable by a simple constructive argument (Lynch and Mason [43]).
