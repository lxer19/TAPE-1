Abstract: represent a linear transformation in the standard basis. Find a new basis such that the same linear transformation can be represented as a diagonal matrix. What is the geometric relationship between the new basis and the old? Find the effect of the transformation on a vector [x; y] T in the standard basis, by first representing the vector in the new basis. Draw a figure. d) Apply the same transformation n times to the same vector and compute the resulting vector. e) Ex. 2.7 in Gaussian notes.
