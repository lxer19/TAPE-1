Title: The Church-Rosser Theorem in Isabelle: A Proof Porting Experiment  
Author: Ole Rasmussen 
Keyword: Isabelle.  
Date: March 1995  
Address: Cambridge  
Affiliation: Computer Laboratory University of  
Abstract: This paper describes a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem for the pure -calculus formalised in the Isabelle theorem prover. The initial version of the proof is ported from a similar proof done in the Coq proof assistant by Gerard Huet, but a number of optimisations have been performed. The development involves the introduction of several inductive and recursive definitions and thus gives a good presentation of the inductive package of

Reference-contexts: A thorough description of the lambda calculus and the Tait Martin-Lof proof of the Church-Rosser theorem can be found in <ref> [Bar84] </ref>. <p> In our case this means that it suffices to show that 1 ! is confluent. This is unfortunately not true as can be understood from the following counter-example taken from <ref> [Bar84] </ref>: Let R ! R 0 ; then the following term can be reduced in two ways: (x:xx)R ! RR or (x:xx)R ! (x:xx)R 0 A common reduct would be R 0 R 0 , but this cannot be reached in one step from RR.

Reference-contexts: Formalisation of this proof is not new and the first mechanical proof was done in the Boyer-Moore prover by Shankar [Sha88] and has later been described by Huet as mentioned above and in for example [Pfe92]. The Church-Rosser theorem has also been proved for combinatorial logic in for example <ref> [CM92] </ref> and by Paulson contained in the Isabelle ZF distribution. The proofs for combinatorial logic are however much simpler.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we describe a formal development of the residual theory for the pure -calculus leading to a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem. The proof originates from Gerard Huet [Hue94] using the Coq proof assistant <ref> [D + 93] </ref>. In this development we construct the same proof but with the Isabelle theorem prover [Pau94b] using the object-logic of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (from now on just called ZF).

Reference-contexts: At some points we will be rather informal but all notions used will be defined formally in Section 4. We expect some familiarity with the -calculus, such as the notion of fi-reduction and representing -terms by de Bruijn indexes <ref> [dB72] </ref>, although they will also be defined and exemplified in Section 4. A thorough description of the lambda calculus and the Tait Martin-Lof proof of the Church-Rosser theorem can be found in [Bar84].

Reference-contexts: This allowed the proof development of the initial version to be finished in less than two weeks of normal working hours. Huet used 3 months to construct the proof (or "1 monk month" as he writes) using an existing pre-formal development in ML <ref> [Hue92] </ref>. 5.2 Remove Superfluous Type Information The observation behind this optimisation is that all inductive predicates are defined as subtypes.

Isabelle has been described in numerous articles but for a thorough presentation of the system please refer to <ref> [Pau94b] </ref>. Isabelle is a generic logical framework meant for defining different proof systems. The user must distinguish between two levels of abstraction, the meta-level and the object-level, where the former is used to define a particular object logic.

The size of the substitution proofs decreased by over 1/3 after changing the definitions to the current formulation, thus computational considerations can be expensive in proofs.
