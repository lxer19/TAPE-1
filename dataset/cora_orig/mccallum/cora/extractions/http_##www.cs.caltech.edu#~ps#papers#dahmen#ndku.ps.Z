Abstract: This paper is concerned with the construction of biorthogonal multiresolution analyses on [0; 1] such that the corresponding wavelets realize any desired order of moment conditions throughout the interval. Our starting point is the family of biorthogonal pairs consisting of cardinal B-splines and compactly supported dual generators on IR developed by Cohen, Daubechies and Feauveau. In contrast to previous investigations we preserve the full degree of polynomial reproduction also for the dual multiresolution and prove in general that the corresponding modifications of dual generators near the end points of the interval still permit the biorthogonalization of the resulting bases. The subsequent construction of compactly supported biorthogonal wavelets is based on the concept of stable completions. As a first step we derive an initial decomposition of the spline spaces where the complement spaces between two successive levels are spanned by compactly supported splines which form uniformly stable bases on each level. As a second step these initial complements are then projected into the desired complements spanned by compactly supported biorthogonal wavelets. Since all generators and wavelets on the primal as well as on the dual side have finitely supported masks the corresponding decomposition and reconstruction algorithms are simple and efficient. The desired number of vanishing moments is implied by the polynomial exactness of the dual multires-olution. Again due to the polynomial exactness the primal and dual spaces satisfy corresponding Jackson estimates. In addition, Bernstein inequalities can be shown to hold for a range of Sobolev norms depending on the regularity of the primal and dual wavelets. Then it follows from general principles that the wavelets form Riesz bases for L 2 ([0; 1]) and that weighted sequence norms for the coefficients of such wavelet expansions characterize Sobolev spaces and their duals on [0; 1] within a range depending on the parameters in the Jackson and Bernstein estimates.

Reference-contexts: Some of these results are known, some are implicit in various studies and some are simply folklore. Nevertheless, we hope that the reader will benefit from putting them briefly together since we feel that they help making several somewhat technical developments more transparent. The main tools are stable completions <ref> [CDP] </ref> and associated stability criteria as well as a mechanism for generating from some initial multiscale decomposition of a multiresolution space other complements which correspond to biorthogonal wavelets. Moreover, we recall a general criterion for establishing the Riesz-basis property and Sobolev norm equivalences based on direct and inverse estimates [D2]. <p> The arguments which we will employ actually hold in greater generality and since they will be used in different settings we will formulate the main facts in sufficient generality to permit their flexible application. For later use we record a few facts from <ref> [CDP] </ref>. Let H be some Hilbert space with inner product h; i and norm k k H . <p> In fact, viewing as above j as a vector (2.1.2) takes the form T j+1 M j;0 : (2.1.3) Moreover, denoting by [X; Y ] the space of bounded linear operators from a normed linear space X into the normed linear space Y one has <ref> [CDP] </ref> M j;0 2 [` 2 ( j ); ` 2 ( j+1 )]; kM j;0 k = O (1); j j 0 ; (2.1.4) where kM j;0 k := sup kM j;0 uk ` 2 ( j+1 ) : Although in all our applications the index sets j will be <p> Now suppose again that H = L 2 () where is some sufficiently smooth manifold so that Sobolev spaces H s are well-defined for the range of indices under consideration. First recall the following fact from <ref> [CDP] </ref>. Remark 2.3 Let f j g be uniformly stable. The Q j defined by (2.2.3) are uniformly bounded if and only if f ~ j g is uniformly stable as well. <p> = G j = G j;1 , one obtains the reconstruction formula T j G j;0 + T Given j and M j;0 , any M j;1 2 [` 2 (r j ); ` 2 ( j+1 )] such that (2.3.2) holds is called a stable completion of M j;0 <ref> [CDP] </ref>. Clearly the pair of two scale relations (2.1.3), (2.3.1) together with (2.3.4) gives rise to cascadic decomposition and reconstruction algorithms whose structure is analogous to the classical wavelet schemes on the real line. <p> Their description in terms of the matrices M j;e ; G j;e , e 2 f0; 1g, can be found e.g. in <ref> [CDP] </ref>. Recall that uniform stability of f j [ j g does by no means imply the Riesz basis property (1.2.17) of the union of the complement bases j for all j j 0 . This is where biorthogonality comes into play (see [D1, D2]). <p> Thus, given some stable completion M j;1 of M j;0 we need next a mechanism to generate the stable completion corresponding to the particular complements (Q j Q j1 )S ( j ). It can be based on the following observation from <ref> [CDP] </ref>. Suppose in the sequel that the biorthogonal collections f j g, f ~ j g are both uniformly stable and refinable with refinement matrices M j;0 , ~ M j;0 , i.e., T j+1 M j;0 ; ~ T j+1 Proposition 2.6 ([CDP]) Let f j g, f ~ j

Reference-contexts: For instance, consider a Daubechies scaling function d of sufficient regularity and order d of exactness. There is a canonical way of generating a family of dual pairs dr ; d+r essentially by differentiation and integration described e.g. in <ref> [CF, DKU, Le, U1] </ref>. One could then employ integration by parts as in the above proof but so that one ends up with a Gramian matrix whose regularity follows from the linear independence of the involved functions.

Reference-contexts: This leads to similar requirements on the wavelets defined on the boundary curve or surface. Furthermore, biorthogonal wavelet bases are used for the pressure computation when employing divergence free wavelets for the Stokes problem [U2]. Our starting point is a family of biorthogonal multiresolution analyses on IR developed in <ref> [CDF] </ref>. Specifically, we confine the discussion to the case where the primal multiresolution is generated by cardinal B-splines. <p> j of S j ; ~ S j in S j+1 ; ~ S j+1 , respectively, satisfying ~ W j ?S j ; W j ? ~ S j ; (1.2.11) so that, by (1.2.5), W j ? ~ W r ; j 6= r: (1.2.12) It is known <ref> [CDF] </ref> that defining new masks b k := (1) k ~a 1k ; ~ b k := (1) k a 1k ; k 2 ZZ ; (1.2.13) such spaces W j ; ~ W j are generated by the dilates and translates of the functions (x) := k2ZZ X ~ b <p> The objective of the subsequent investigation is to construct biorthogonal wavelet bases for L 2 ([0; 1]) retaining as many properties of the above setting as possible. 5 1.3 The Layout of the Paper The standard derivation of the above facts makes heavy use of Fourier techniques (see e.g. <ref> [CDF] </ref>). When working on the interval such techniques are not directly applicable which forces us to resort to alternative tools. Therefore we briefly collect in Section 2 a few general concepts which will serve that purpose and will guide later constructions. <p> The B-spline d ' is refinable with finitely supported real mask a = fa k g ` 2 d '(x) = k=` 1 k + b d ` 2 X a k '(2x k): (3.2.4) It has been shown in <ref> [CDF] </ref> that for each d and any ~ d d, ~ d 2 IN , so that d + ~ d even, there exists a function d; ~ d ~' 2 L 2 (IR) with the following properties (see [CDF]): (i) d; ~ d ~' has compact support, supp d; ~ <p> X a k '(2x k): (3.2.4) It has been shown in <ref> [CDF] </ref> that for each d and any ~ d d, ~ d 2 IN , so that d + ~ d even, there exists a function d; ~ d ~' 2 L 2 (IR) with the following properties (see [CDF]): (i) d; ~ d ~' has compact support, supp d; ~ d ~' = h 2 d ~ d + 1 + 1 2 d + ~ d 1 + 1 i (ii) d; ~ d ~' is refinable with finitely supported mask ~ a = f~a k g ~ <p> For instance, in the case d = 2 the interior complement functions correspond to the hierarchical bases from [Y]. Therefore, it may not be surprising that the subsequent projection into biorthogonal bases in Theorem 4.7 below seems to produce automatically interior wavelets which agree with those derived by <ref> [CDF] </ref>. The construction of the initial stable completion M j;1 of M j;0 in (3.5.1) consists of several steps, each of which involves different matrices which are described most conveniently in a schematic block form. <p> to j = j 0 = 5: (5.3.1) First we list a table of the parameters j; d; ~ d; ` 1 ; ` 2 ; ~ ` 1 ; ~ ` 2 , `(d), `; ~ `, # j , # j+1 and the mask coefficients a; ~ a <ref> [CDF] </ref> which are scaled here such that they sum to 2. The first realization follows exactly the derivation in the paper and computes the filter coefficients as derived in Sections 3 and 4. This corresponds to the case C j = I, ~ C j from (3.5.10). <p> Note that, as expected, the primal and dual wavelets remain the same under the change of generator bases. Moreover, the primal and dual wavelets corresponding to the interior stationary part seem to coincide with those constructed in <ref> [CDF] </ref>.
