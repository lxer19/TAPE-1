Abstract: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well in traditional networks made up of wired links with stationary hosts. Networks with wireless links and mobile hosts violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded performance. In this paper, we describe a simple protocol that improves TCP performance by modifying network-layer software only at a basestation, without violating end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea is to cache packets at the basestation and perform local retransmissions. Simulations of this protocol show that is it significantly more robust in the presence of multiple packet losses in a single transmission window as compared to TCP. This enables our protocol to tolerate at least 10 times as The significant increase in recent activity in the area of wireless networks indicates that mobile hosts along with their wireless links will be an integral part of future networks. Communication over such networks shows quite different characteristics compared to traditional wired networks. Wireless links do not (at present) have bandwidths as high as on wired links, show much higher error rates. Furthermore, since the predominant model for wireless communication is the cellular connection, frequent delays are caused due to handoffs as users move from cell to cell. These handoffs involve transfer of communication state (typically network-level state) from one basestation (a router between a wired and wireless network) to another, and typically last for anywhere between a few tens to a few hundreds of milliseconds [CI94, KMS + 93, SLBR94]. Reliable transport protocols like TCP [CS94, RFC89] have been tuned for traditional networks made up of wired links and stationary hosts. TCP performs very well on such networks by adapting to end-to-end delays and packet losses. TCP provides reliability by maintaining a running average of estimated round-trip delay and mean deviation, and by retransmitting any packet whose acknowledgment isnt received within twice the deviation from the average. Due to the relatively low error rates over wired networks, packet losses are assumed to be as a result of congestion. Unfortunately, in the presence of the high error rates present in wireless links, this assumption causes TCP to suffer a significant degradation in performance in the form of poor throughput and very high interactive delays when used in a wireless environment [CI94]. This behavior arises due to the fact that errors on the wireless link or delays due to handoffs are incorrectly interpreted by TCP at the sender as congestion. In response to this congestion, TCP drops its transmission window size before retransmitting packets, initiates congestion control mechanisms (slow start [Jac88]) and resets the retransmission timer using an exponential backoff computation from the previous value (Karns Algorithm [KP87]), thereby unnecessarily reducing its bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we describe a simple protocol to alleviate this degradation and present the results of several simulations of this protocol. Our aim is to improve end-to-end performance on networks with wireless links without changing existing TCP implementations at the end hosts and without recompiling or relinking existing applications. We achieve this by a simple set of modifications to the network-layer software at the basestation. Our simulations indicate that we achieve equivalent or better performance over a channel with a given error rate as compared to unmodified TCP (based on the 4.3BSD-Reno version) over a channel with one-tenth that error rate. Furthermore, we achieve bandwidth speedups of up to 25 times that of the unmodified TCP connection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe and evaluate some design alternatives and related work that deal with this problem. In Section 3, we describe the details of our protocol and the modifications to the router software at the basestation. We present the results of our simulations in Section 4, and conclude with our proposals for future work in Section 5. We intend to have a working implementation and performance results of our protocol in the next few months, by the time the final version of the paper is due. high an error rate without any performance degradation.

Reference-contexts: Link-level Retransmissions: In this approach, the wireless link implements its own retransmission protocol at the data link level. In addition, TCP implements its own end-to-end retransmission protocol. Studies have shown that independent retransmission protocols such as these lead to degraded performance, especially as error rates become significant <ref> [DCY93] </ref>. A tight coupling of transport- and link-level retransmission timeouts and policies is necessary for good performance. In particular, information needs to be passed down to the data link layer about timeout values and policies reasonable for co-existence with the higher transport layer policy.
