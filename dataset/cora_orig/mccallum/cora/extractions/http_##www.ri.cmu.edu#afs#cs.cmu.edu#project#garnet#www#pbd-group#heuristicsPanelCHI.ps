Abstract: DEFINITION It is the conventional wisdom in user interface design that ``Heuristics'' are a problem solving technique in which the direct manipulation is best and that interfaces should be most appropriate solution is chosen using rules. Interfaces predictable. This tends to argue against having a system using heuristics may perform different actions on different ``guess'' or use heuristics or other AI approaches. data given the same command. A simple example is that However, an increasing number of today's successful the Macintosh moves a file if dragged from one folder to software products do use heuristics in their interfaces. The another, unless the folders are on different devices, in heuristics are used to help guide the user and to perform which case the file is copied instead. The designers tasks that would be too difficult to specify by conventional naturally try to make sure that the system will choose the direct manipulation approaches. We believe that user inter- correct solution, but sometimes the system may do the in-face designers will increasingly need to consider using correct action. Thus, these systems can be said to guess heuristic techniques in their interfaces. This panel dis- what the user wants to do in this situation. However, since cusses a number of today's successful products using these are deterministic algorithms, many people object to heuristics and the important HCI design issues such as the term ``guess'' applied to the computer. However, it feedback. may not appear deterministic to users if they cannot tell Virtually all Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems use heuristics of one form or another: they try to make an intelligent choice about what the operation should be. Whereas applications that are clearly labeled as ``AI'' are not particularly popular in today's marketplace, heuristics are being used in small ways in a large number of programs, and their use is increasing. The range of ``intelligence'' of these interfaces is enormous, from a single easy-to-understand rule to a complete rule-based system. This panel will survey a number of real products that use heuristics and discuss the significant design issues that they have in common. (Intelligent user interfaces in general is the topic of a series of workshops [4], the most recent of which was held in Orlando, Florida in January, 1993.)
