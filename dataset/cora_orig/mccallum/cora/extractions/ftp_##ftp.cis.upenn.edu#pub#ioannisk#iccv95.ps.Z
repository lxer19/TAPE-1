Abstract: We present a novel motion-based approach for the part determination and shape estimation of a human's body parts. The novelty of the technique is that neither a prior model of the human body is employed nor prior body part segmentation is assumed. We present a Human Body Part Identification Strategy (HBPIS) that recovers all the body parts of a moving human based on the spatiotemporal analysis of its deforming silhouette. We formalize the process of simultaneous part determination, and 2D shape estimation by employing the Supervisory Control Theory of Discrete Event Systems. In addition, in order to acquire the 3D shape of the body parts, we present a new algorithm which selectively integrates the (segmented by the HBPIS) apparent contours, from three mutually orthogonal views. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments, where a subject performs a set of movements according to a protocol that reveals the structure of the human body.

Reference-contexts: The shape x of the composed primitive (C:[v b ; v e ) ! RI 2 ) can be defined in terms of the parameters of the defining primitives x 0 and x 1 as follows (see <ref> [5] </ref> for more details): x (v; v A 0 ; c) = (1 ffi (v; h 1 0 ); h 1 0 ); c) x 0 (h 0 (v)) + 0 (v A 0 (v B Since humans have widely varied anthropometric dimensions the first part of the tracking process should <p> To achieve this goal we perform a controlled experiment. We request that the individual under observation performs a set of movements (protocol movA in <ref> [5] </ref>) that reveals the structure of the human body and ensures that all the major parts of the human body become visible. The result of processing the image data from this set of movements will be a 2D model of the subject's body including its parts and their shape. <p> For step 2 of the HBPIS, we fit the models included in list L to the image data, using our weighted-force assignment algorithm [6] which allows the overlap between models and therefore, the instant rotation center of a part can be determined (see <ref> [5] </ref>). 2.1 Implementation of the HBPIS In this section we describe the modeling and the control of the processes involved in the system implementing the HBPIS, using the Discrete Event Systems theory. <p> Due to the complexity of the shape of the human body and occlusion among the body parts, the subject is requested to perform a different set of movements (protocol movB 3 in <ref> [5] </ref>) that incrementally reveals the structure of the body. Our approach is to first build a single 3D model of the human standing, and then to incrementally refine it by extracting the 3D models of the different parts as they become visible to the different views. <p> Therefore, the deformable model fits accurately the 2D models, while its shape in between the apparent contours (in the absence of any data) varies smoothly. 4 Experimental Results This section presents selected results from a series of experiments (a detailed description is offered in <ref> [5] </ref>) that were carried out on real image sequences in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in general and of the specific algorithms in particular. The first experiment was designed to evaluate the performances of the Part Composition Invocation Criterion, and of the Part Decomposition A algorithm.
