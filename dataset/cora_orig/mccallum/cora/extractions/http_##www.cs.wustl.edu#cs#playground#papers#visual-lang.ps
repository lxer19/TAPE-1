Title: Visual Specification of Interprocess and Intraprocess Communication  
Author: T. Paul McCartney and Kenneth J. Goldman 
Address: St. Louis, Missouri 63130  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Washington University  
Abstract: We present a visual specification language for constructing distributed applications and their direct manipulation graphical user interfaces. Each distributed application consists of a collection of independent modules and a configuration of logical connections that define communication among the data interfaces of the modules. Our specification language uses a single visual mechanism that allows end-users to define in-terprocess communication among distributed modules and to define intraprocess communication among objects within a module. This visual language provides a general encapsulation/abstraction mechanism and is designed to support dynamic change to the communication structure. User interfaces are completely de-coupled from the module(s) they control.

Reference-contexts: Using the graphics package, we have implemented the "connection manager" direct manipulation graphical interface for managing interprocess communication Playground system (see Figures 7 and 9). As a foundation for our in-traprocess communication, we have implemented an efficient incremental constraint solver. The solver uses ideas from the DeltaBlue algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> for local constraint strength propagation, but it resolves cycles of constraints intelligently and has improved time complexity. 7 Conclusion We have presented a visual specification language for the configuration of distributed multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: In this section we highlight some of the related work in the area of coordination lan-guages for configurable distributed systems and in the area of visual specification of user interfaces. The purpose of a coordination language <ref> [5] </ref> is to separate communication from computation in order to offer programmers a uniform communication abstraction that is independent of a particular programming language or operating system.

Reference-contexts: The system is free to make choices about how to implement the communication specified by each connection in the configuration. 1.1 I/O abstraction Our model of interprocess communication is called I/O abstraction <ref> [6] </ref>. Each module in a system has a module boundary 1 containing values (published data structures) that may be externally observed and/or manipulated. A distributed application consists of a collection of independent modules and a configuration of logical connections among the published values at module boundaries. <p> Our treatment of interprocess communication is completely general, while our treatment of intraprocess communication concentrates on the specification of sophisticated direct-manipulation graphical user interfaces that interact with multiple independent modules in a distributed application. 1 In other papers <ref> [6, 18] </ref> describing the I/O abstraction concept, the data interface of an I/O abstraction module has been called the "presentation." Since this paper deals with interfaces for visual languages, we use the term boundary in order to avoid confusion with user "interfaces" and a visual "presentation." In the intraprocess communication area, <p> Here, we mention three systems that are representative of this paradigm. The Thinglab system [2] uses multiway constraints to specify relationships between parts of a simulation graphical display. Thinglab represents early work in graphi 2 See the technical report version of <ref> [6] </ref> for a comparison of I/O abstraction with other communication models. cal constraint systems and provided the foundation for many later systems. The Garnet system [14] provides a toolkit which allows the user to construct interactive graphical user interfaces using an object oriented constraint based library.

Reference-contexts: The separation of computation from communication permits local reasoning about functional components in terms of well-defined interfaces and allows systems to be designed by assembling collections of individually verified components. Coordination languages typically provide a structured configuration mechanism for specifying relationships among program modules. For example, Dar-win <ref> [13] </ref> is a configuration language for managing message-passing connections between process ports in a dynamic system. Processes are expressed in a separate computation language that allows ports to be declared for interconnection within Darwin.

Reference-contexts: Also, we have designed and implemented a customized graphics package which will be used as the foundation of the user interface management system. This graphics package is currently implemented on top of the X window system <ref> [16] </ref>, but it is not designed exclusively for X windows. Using the graphics package, we have implemented the "connection manager" direct manipulation graphical interface for managing interprocess communication Playground system (see Figures 7 and 9). As a foundation for our in-traprocess communication, we have implemented an efficient incremental constraint solver.
