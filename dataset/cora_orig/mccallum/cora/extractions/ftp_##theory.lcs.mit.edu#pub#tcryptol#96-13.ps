Abstract: A visual cryptography scheme is a method to encode a secret image SI into shadow images called shares such that certain qualified subsets of shares enable the "visual" recovery of the secret image. The "visual" recovery consists of xeroxing the shares onto transparencies, and then stacking them. The shares of a qualified set will reveal the secret image without any cryptographic computation. In this paper we analyze the contrast of the reconstructed image in k out of n visual cryptography schemes. (In such a scheme any k shares will reveal the image, but no set of k 1 shares gives any information about the image.) In the case of 2 out of n threshold schemes we give a complete characterization of schemes having optimal contrast and minimum pixel expansion in terms of certain balanced incomplete block designs. In the case of k out of n threshold schemes with k 3 we obtain upper and lower bounds on the optimal contrast.

Reference-contexts: They analyzed the case of a k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes, in which the secret image 1 is visible if and only if any k transparencies are stacked together. Further results on k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes can be found in <ref> [1, 2, 8] </ref>. The model by Naor and Shamir has been extended in [1, 2] to general access structures (an access structure is a specification of all qualified and forbidden subsets of participants), where general techniques to construct visual cryptography schemes for any access structure have been proposed. <p> Further results on k out of n threshold visual cryptography schemes can be found in [1, 2, 8]. The model by Naor and Shamir has been extended in <ref> [1, 2] </ref> to general access structures (an access structure is a specification of all qualified and forbidden subsets of participants), where general techniques to construct visual cryptography schemes for any access structure have been proposed. <p> Naor and Shamir showed (see Theorem 5.3 in [12]) that there exist (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes with m = 2 O (k log k) log n and ff (m) = 2 (k) . The construction presented in <ref> [1] </ref> (see Theorem 6.2) yields schemes with m = O (k (2e) k log n). <p> For small values of k and n, the schemes obtained are quite efficient. However, for n large with respect to k, the value of m is much larger than in the schemes obtained in <ref> [1, 12] </ref>. In this paper we will present a technique to realize (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography scheme achieving a bigger value of the relative difference when k &lt; n. <p> The next lemma was proved in <ref> [1] </ref>; we repeat its proof here for the reader's convenience. Lemma 3.1 Let ( Qual ; Forb ) be an access structure on a set of participants P. <p> exists a ( Qual ; Forb ; m)-VCS, then there exists a ([P 0 ] Qual ; [P 0 ] Forb ; m)-VCS. 4 (2; n)-threshold VCSs with Optimal Contrast In this section we describe (2; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes achieving a greater relative difference than the ones presented in <ref> [1, 2, 8, 12] </ref>. The n fi m basis matrix S 1 is realized by considering all the binary n-vectors of weight bn=2c. Hence, m = n and any row in S 1 has weight equal to n1 . <p> The weight of any column of M is either bn=2c or dn=2e. 2. For any pair of distinct rows of M any unavoidable pattern appears exactly ff (m) m times. 3. For any M 2 C 0 [ C 1 it holds that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = w (M [2]) = = w (M [n]), that is, all the rows have the same weight w. Moreover, if n is even, then w = m=2; otherwise bn=2c (m=n) w dn=2e (m=n). 5. For any M 2 C 1 the set fM [1]; M [2]; : : :; <p> that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = w (M [2]) = = w (M [n]), that is, all the rows have the same weight w. Moreover, if n is even, then w = m=2; otherwise bn=2c (m=n) w dn=2e (m=n). 5. For any M 2 C 1 the set fM [1]; M [2]; : : :; M [n]g is a (m; n; 2 ff fl (n) m) equidistant code with constant weight w. Proof. <p> From Property 2: of Definition 2.1 for any M 2 C 0 it holds that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = = w (M [n]), hence we get that M [1] = M [2] = = M [n]. For any M 2 C 1 the rows of M have the same weight w and any two rows of M differ in exactly 2 ff fl (n) m positions. <p> From Property 2: of Definition 2.1 for any M 2 C 0 it holds that w = w (M <ref> [1] </ref>) = = w (M [n]), hence we get that M [1] = M [2] = = M [n]. For any M 2 C 1 the rows of M have the same weight w and any two rows of M differ in exactly 2 ff fl (n) m positions. <p> Apply Property 2: to row j using the set Y 0 of k 1 rows. Then A j Y 0 ff (m) m. Hence, A i Y ff (m) m, as desired. Example 6.1 We give basis matrices for a (3; 4)-threshold VCS presented in <ref> [1] </ref>: S 0 = 6 6 000111 001101 3 7 5 2 6 4 100110 001110 7 7 : This VCS has m = 6 and ff (m) = 1=6. From this scheme we obtain two (2; 3)-threshold VCS. <p> Indeed, Let C 0 and C 1 be the collections of n fi m boolean matrices of a (k; n)-threshold VCS . Without loss of generality we can assume that r = jC 0 j = jC 1 j (see Section 2.1 of <ref> [1] </ref>). We can easily realize from C 0 and C 1 a scheme having the same relative difference as . Suppose that C 0 = fM 0;1 ; : : : ; M 0;r g and C 1 = fM 1;1 ; : : : ; M 1;r g. <p> Hence, it follows that ff (k; n) 2 k2 : As a consequence of the previous theorem we have the following results which solve an open problem in <ref> [1] </ref>. The next result closes the gap on the pixel expansion for the access structures #16 and #17 analyzed in Section 9 of [1]. Theorem 6.4 Let 1 and 2 be the access structures having basis f123; 124; 134; 234g and f123; 124; 134g, respectively. <p> it follows that ff (k; n) 2 k2 : As a consequence of the previous theorem we have the following results which solve an open problem in <ref> [1] </ref>. The next result closes the gap on the pixel expansion for the access structures #16 and #17 analyzed in Section 9 of [1]. Theorem 6.4 Let 1 and 2 be the access structures having basis f123; 124; 134; 234g and f123; 124; 134g, respectively. In any visual cryptography scheme for 1 or 2 , the relative difference satisfies ff (m) 1=6 which implies that the pixel expansion m satisfies m 6. Proof. <p> Proof. From Corollary 6.2 we get that m (k; n) 2 m (k 1; n 1) from which we obtain that m (k; n) 2 k2 m (2; n k + 2). Applying Theorem 7.3 of <ref> [1] </ref>, which states that in any (2; n)-threshold VCS, the pixel expansion m satisfies n m 2 c , the theorem holds. The next corollary is an immediate consequence of previous theorem. <p> Consequently, h ff (m) m, ff (m) 1=2 k1 , and m 2 k1 . Proof. We start by noticing that by Property 1 of Definition 2.2, the column with all zeroes has to belong to S 0 (e.g., see Lemma 5.11 of <ref> [1] </ref>). Assume that this all zeroes column appears with multiplicity h (by Lemma 5.11 of [1] it holds that h ff (m) m). Suppose that c and d are boolean columns of length n that differ only in one entry, say the i-th entry. <p> Proof. We start by noticing that by Property 1 of Definition 2.2, the column with all zeroes has to belong to S 0 (e.g., see Lemma 5.11 of <ref> [1] </ref>). Assume that this all zeroes column appears with multiplicity h (by Lemma 5.11 of [1] it holds that h ff (m) m). Suppose that c and d are boolean columns of length n that differ only in one entry, say the i-th entry. Suppose that c appears with multiplicity h in S j (j = 0 or 1). <p> Also, Theorem 7.1 gives a more precise characterization of (k; k)-threshold VCS than the one provided by Theorem 10 and Corollary 11 of [8] which can be easily derived from our last result. Lemma 5.3 of <ref> [1] </ref> states that if S 0 and S 1 are the two basis matrices of a (k; n)-threshold VCS and D is any n fi p boolean matrix, then S 0 ffi D and S 1 ffi D are basis matrices of a (k; n)-threshold VCS.

Also, Theorem 7.1 gives a more precise characterization of (k; k)-threshold VCS than the one provided by Theorem 10 and Corollary 11 of [8] which can be easily derived from our last result.

Reference-contexts: This method yields a higher contrast in the reconstructed image for 2 out of n threshold schemes, but the technique is not applicable to k out of n threshold schemes with k 3. * Visual cryptography schemes to encrypt coloured images are given in <ref> [11, 14, 15] </ref>.
