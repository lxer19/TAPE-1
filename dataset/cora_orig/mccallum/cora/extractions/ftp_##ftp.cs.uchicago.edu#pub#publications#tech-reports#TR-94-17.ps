Abstract: This paper was presented at the Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science 1994 | 19th International Symposium, MFCS '94, Kosice, Slovakia, August 1994 | Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, volume 841, Igor Prvara, Branislav Rovan and Peter Ruzicka editors, Springer-Verlag, 1984, pp. 87-111. Abstract Formal countermodels may be used to justify the unprovability of formulae in the Heyting calculus (the best accepted formal system for constructive reasoning), on the grounds that unprovable formulae are constructively invalid. We argue that the intuitive impact of such countermodels becomes more transparent and convincing as we move from Kripke/Beth models based on possible worlds, to Lauchli realizability models. We introduce a new semantics for constructive reasoning, called relational realizability, which strengthens further the intuitive impact of Lauchli realizability. But, none of these model theories provides countermodels with the compelling impact of classical truth-table countermodels for classically unprovable formulae. We prove soundness of the Heyting calculus for relational realiz-ability, and conjecture that there is a constructive choice-free proof of completeness. In this respect, relational realizability improves the metamathematical constructivity of Lauchli realizability (which uses choice in two crucial ways to prove completeness) in the same sort of way Beth semantics improves Kripke semantics.

Reference-contexts: In the new view, constructive reasoning (where each entire construction is invariant) is pinned between two different semantic interpretations of classical reasoning: one requiring no invariance, and the other requiring invariance at every level of the type hierarchy. * Characterize useful concepts of relevant implication <ref> [1] </ref> in realizability models. For example, in Lauchli realizability models a candidate definition is ff relevantly implies fi if and only if there is a function from P (ff) to P (fi) that is an isomorphism on each orbit of P (ff) (invariance requires only a homomorphism).

Reference-contexts: Kripke and Beth models are very useful for metamathematical investigations, but they do not correspond convincingly to sets of intuitive circumstances. Dummet <ref> [4] </ref> discusses the intuitive shortcomings of Kripke and Beth semantics. Here, we merely note the apparent difficulties in interpreting the diagram of Figure 1b as a description of circumstances conceivable to a constructive intuition. <p> What is the theory of this modal system? Clearly +ff is valid if and only if ff is constructively valid. Contrast this behavior with the usual encoding of constructive logic into the classical modal logic of necessity, where the necessity mode is added to every subformula of ff <ref> [27, 4] </ref>. Notice that ff with + at every subformula is valid if and only if ff is classically valid. The modal realizability approach appears to give a very different combination of classical and constructive logic than the well-known one based on necessity in possible worlds.

Reference-contexts: So proof formulae, as well as propositional formulae, have semantic content.

It is straightforward to read a typed lambda term of type ff, on the one hand as a natural deduction proof of ff, or on the other hand as a program defining a uniform construction demonstrating the validity of ff.

Modal operators are defined to make assertions about the possible worlds that are connected to the actual one (for example, knowledge is often defined as truth in all accessible worlds). Another approach is to interpret modal operators within realizability models as additional constraints on the realizers.

Reference-contexts: Every one of the systems that we discuss can be extended easily to deal with negation, but in some cases that extension is somewhat subtle to understand|for example see <ref> [15] </ref> for a discussion of negation in Lauchli realizability models. We use a predicate calculus without function symbols and without equality. All of the proposed systems can be extended to deal with functions and equality, but such an extension would only obscure the message of this paper. <p> The interpretation of typed ambda terms as propositional proof formulae is discussed in more detail in <ref> [15] </ref>. Sequent derivations are less transparent to the intuition than proof terms, but more flexible for certain metamathe-matical arguments, so for this paper we define proof in terms of sequents.

Lauchli analyzed realizability models in which a piece of evidence is a realizer if and only if it is invariant under certain permutations. <p> Lauchli proved that the first-order Heyting predicate calculus is sound and complete for Lauchli models. The proof of completeness is highly nonconstructive, and appears to depend in an essential way on the axiom of choice. <ref> [15] </ref> explains in some detail a plausible intuition behind Lauchli models, and reformulates the proof of completeness at the propositional level to make the constructive and nonconstructive elements more transparent. <p> At a technical level, there is a straightforward construction of a Kripke model given a Lauchli model <ref> [15] </ref>. The essential idea is that each subgroup of N represents a Kripke world, and that the subgroup relation determines accessibility. Truth in an individual world is just posession of an invariant under the smaller permutation group.
