Abstract: The authors and coworkers recently proved general theorems on the global stabilization of linear systems subject to control saturation. This paper develops in detail an explicit design for the linearized equations of longitudinal flight control for an F-8 aircraft, and tests the obtained controller on the original nonlinear model. This paper represents the first detailed derivation of a controller using the techniques in question, and the results are very encouraging.

(Note that the problem considered here is different from the question treated in those references, and only the data is employed. Also, we add a saturation to the model. <p> We consider the system with constants given in (6) and the desired equilibrium at: 0 = 389:1; ff 0 = :24007; 0 = :23759; (7) The above values are essentially those given in <ref> [1] </ref>, but calculated more precisely using the Maple symbolic manipulation system (the numbers in that reference, namely: 0 = 388:7; ff 0 = 0:240; 0 = 0:238; q 0 = 0; ffi e 0 = 0:05, give numerical values significantly far from zero when substituted in the equations). 3.

Then we proceed to compare the performance of our controller, applied to the original nonlinear airplane, and starting reasonably far from the desired operating point, with the "naive" controller that would result from applying a linear feedback law which would stabilize in the absence of saturations. 2. <p> Disregarding the saturation, the eigenvalues of (8) are 0; 0; 0 and: 1=2 (e + h) 1=2 (e 2 + 2eh h 2 4g) 1=2 p Following the procedure in <ref> [12, 8] </ref>, we wish to trans form (8) into a system of the following form: _x 1 = 1=2 (e + h)x 1 + x 2 _x 3 = x 4 _x 5 = (x 5 + u) ; where = 1=2 (e 2 + 2eh h 2 4g) 1=2 . <p> Finally, we carry out the design following the general outline of the construction in <ref> [12, 8] </ref>, as applied to a system in the form (9) and provide a very simple feedback, which uses one saturation. (Note that in the closed-loop system there is one other saturation, which is part of the original system: the one that already exists in the equation for _x 5 .) <p> 5 .) The feedback we obtain is as follows: u = 0:9 (0:2x 3 + 2:2x 4 + 2x 5 ) : (11) These constants 0:9, 0:2, and so forth, are not the ones that would follow from using the very conservative bounds in the proof of the theorems in <ref> [12, 8] </ref>. We picked much better constants, taking advantage of the knowledge of the equations. (Of course, one may expect that a fair amount of such fine tuning will be necessary in any realistic application.) Using the transformation (10), we get a control law for the original system (1). 3.1. <p> Choosing " = 0:01, = 0:9; a = 0:2; b = 2 in the theorem, we obtain the feedback (11).

Therefore, the conclusion of the theorem can be shown to be true for any a; b &gt; 0. <p> The objective was to show that the calculations in the abstract proofs can indeed be carried out explicitly (though this an extremely simple case compared to the generality of the results in <ref> [12, 8] </ref>), and moreover, to study the performance of the resulting controller when used for the original, nonlinear, model. We consider the results to be encouraging and indicating the usefulness of further work along this direction.
