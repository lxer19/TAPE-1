Abstract: The sum capacity of a multi-user synchronous CDMA system is completely characterized in the general case of asymmetric user power constraints this solves the open problem posed in [7] which had solved the equal power constraint case. We identify the signature sequences that achieve sum capacity and indicate a simple recursive algorithm to construct them.

Reference-contexts: Proof of Lemma 3.1: First, observe that fl is well defined by the expression in (8). It is straightforward from the definition of fl that fl 1 fl L and hence that fl 2 L. Let = ( 1 ; : : : ; L ) 2 L and <ref> [1] </ref> ; : : : [L] denote the order statistics of (see Appendix A for the notation). <p> X (p i fl ) Hence 8k = 1 : : : L 1 we can write k+1 X fl ( k+1 X p i ; L k L k 1 k X fl ) Now, since 2 L we have P L i=1 i = p tot and hence <ref> [1] </ref> p tot L . Furthermore, [1] p 1 . Hence, [1] max p tot ; p 1 = fl We shall complete the proof of the claim that majorizes fl by induction. Suppose P k P k i for some 1 k &lt; L. <p> 8k = 1 : : : L 1 we can write k+1 X fl ( k+1 X p i ; L k L k 1 k X fl ) Now, since 2 L we have P L i=1 i = p tot and hence <ref> [1] </ref> p tot L . Furthermore, [1] p 1 . Hence, [1] max p tot ; p 1 = fl We shall complete the proof of the claim that majorizes fl by induction. Suppose P k P k i for some 1 k &lt; L. <p> : L 1 we can write k+1 X fl ( k+1 X p i ; L k L k 1 k X fl ) Now, since 2 L we have P L i=1 i = p tot and hence <ref> [1] </ref> p tot L . Furthermore, [1] p 1 . Hence, [1] max p tot ; p 1 = fl We shall complete the proof of the claim that majorizes fl by induction. Suppose P k P k i for some 1 k &lt; L. Since P Lk P k [L] , we have [k+1] p tot i=1 [i] Lk . <p> A T-transform is a doubly stochastic matrix of the form T = I + (1 ) Q for some 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and some permutation matrix Q with M 2 diagonal entries equal to 1. To see the operation of a T-transform, let y = (y 1 ; : : : ; y M ) 2 R M . <p> These questions will be answered if the characterization of the entire union capacity region C is done. We currently have preliminary results towards solving this open question. In this paper we have focussed on symbol synchronous CDMA systems. Indeed, most existing capacity results except <ref> [1, 9] </ref> pertain to the symbol synchronous case. The extension College of Engineering, UCB/ERL Memorandum 98/10 13 of our results to the asynchronous situation is also interesting and is an important open problem.

Reference-contexts: The S-CDMA channel above is a special case of the M -user Gaussian multiple access channel and the capacity region (set of rates at which reliable communication is possible) is well known (see Section 7 of <ref> [2] </ref>) as the closure of the convex hull of the union over all product probability densities p X on the inputs X 1 ; : : : ; X M of the rate regions C (S; p X ) = Jf1;:::;Mg (R 1 ; : : : ; R M ) <p> The latter channel is just the K-user Gaussian multiple-access channel and its sum capacity is C = 1 2 log 1 + p tot (see Chapter 7 in <ref> [2] </ref>) in bits/chip. When the input-power constraints are equal, it was shown in [7] that WBE signature sequences (so called because they meet the Welch-Bound-Equality (see [11])) maximize the sum capacity, and the sum capacity then equals C.

Reference-contexts: B Proof of Lemma 4.1 We reproduce here for completeness the proof that if x is majorized by y then x may be derived from y by successive applications of T-transforms (utmost M-1 applications) from the classical text <ref> [3] </ref>. Let x be majorized by y. We assume that x is not obtainable from y by permuting elements of y, else the statement is trivially true. Without loss of generality, let x 1 x M and y 1 y M .

Reference-contexts: We shall now outline an algorithm to construct such a matrix S 2 S. Given any x majorized by y, Theorem 9.B.2 in <ref> [4] </ref> (reproduced as Lemma A.2 in Appendix A) indicates a recursive way of constructing a symmetric matrix with vector of diagonal entries equal to x and vector of eigenvalues equal to y. <p> Below, we outline an algorithm (recursive) that achieves the same goal as above but appears more direct than the classical proof indicated in Theorem 9.B.2 of <ref> [4] </ref>. Also, this algorithm leads directly to the construction of optimal signature sequences, i.e., construction of S 2 S such that SDS t = p tot I. A somewhat related construction appears in [6]. The following notation and definitions are from [4]. <p> than the classical proof indicated in Theorem 9.B.2 of <ref> [4] </ref>.

The following notation and definitions are from [4]. <p> y k + (1 ) y l ; y k+1 ; : : : ; y l1 ; y l + (1 ) y k ; y l+1 ; : : : ; y M ) The following is a fundamental result from the theory of majorization (Lemma 2.B.1 in <ref> [4] </ref>). Lemma 4.1 If x is majorized by y then there exists a sequence of T-transforms T 1 ; : : : ; T n such that x = T n T 2 T 1 y and n &lt; M . <p> Then the lemma says that x = y (M1) . Let T i = i I + (1 i ) Q i where Q i interchanges the k i th and l i th elements (say k i &lt; l i ). The proof of Lemma 2.B.1 in <ref> [4] </ref> explicitly constructs (recursively) the values of i ; k i and l i thereby completely specifying T i for each i = 1 : : : M 1. <p> A Definitions and Relevant Results from Theory of Ma jorization In this appendix we collect together relevant definitions and results from the theory of ma-jorization. All of these results can be found in the comprehensive reference on majorization <ref> [4] </ref>. Majorization makes precise the vague notion that the components of a vector x are "less spread out" or "more nearly equal" than are the components of a vector y by the statement x is majorized by y. <p> Using the observation in (19), for any Schur-concave function and for any vector x 2 R n (x) (x) where x = P n n ; i=1 x i P n n . A well known structure of Schur-convex functions is the following result (Theorem 3.C.1 in <ref> [4] </ref>): If g : R ! R is convex then the symmetric convex function (x) = P n i=1 g (x i ) is Schur-convex. <p> It is well known that the sum of diagonal elements of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. When the matrix is symmetric the precise relationship between the diagonal elements and the eigenvalues is that of majorization: (Theorem 9.B.1, <ref> [4] </ref>). College of Engineering, UCB/ERL Memorandum 98/10 14 Lemma A.1 Let H be a n fi n symmetric matrix with diagonal elements h 1 ; : : : ; h n and eigenvalues 1 ; : : : ; n . <p> Then h That h and cannot be compared by an ordering stronger than majorization is the consequence of the following converse (Theorem 9.B.2, <ref> [4] </ref>): Lemma A.2 If h 1 h n and 1 n are 2n numbers satisfying h in R n , then there exists a real symmetric matrix H with diagonal elements h 1 ; : : : ; h n and eigenvalues 1 ; : : : ; n .

Reference-contexts: We address this issue and focus on finding the "sum capacity" (maximum sum of the rates of all users; maximum over all choices of signature sequences). This problem has been attempted in <ref> [7] </ref> where the authors derive an upper bound on the sum capacity. This upper bound is just the capacity of the system with "no spreading", i.e., of the system with processing gain 1 and an appropriate power constraint on its input (sum of power constraints of the users). <p> of the union over all product probability densities p X on the inputs X 1 ; : : : ; X M of the rate regions C (S; p X ) = Jf1;:::;Mg (R 1 ; : : : ; R M ) : 0 i2J ) Continuing as in <ref> [7] </ref>, the union region over the product distributions, as a function of S, can be simply written as C (S) = Jf1;:::;Mg (R 1 ; : : : ; R M ) : 0 i2J 1 log det I + 2 S J D J S t ) where J is <p> The sum capacity represents the maximum sum of rates of all users at which users can transmit reliably.

This result was observed in <ref> [7] </ref> and the sequences that meet this constraint were denoted WBE sequences (such sequences were also identified in [5]). Our algorithm specialized to this situation constructs WBE sequences for arbitrary M L. <p> One way to do this is to change the performance criterion to a weighted linear combination of the rates of the users, the weights in inverse proportion to the path gains of the users to the base station. A second way is to consider the "symmetric capacity" defined in <ref> [7] </ref>. The symmetric capacity is the sum rate of the maximum achievable equal-rate point in the union capacity region C = S S2S C (S). These questions will be answered if the characterization of the entire union capacity region C is done.

Reference-contexts: Of fundamental interest in this system is the capacity region defined as the set of information rates at which users can transmit while retaining reliable transmission. This problem was addressed in <ref> [8] </ref> and the capacity region was characterized as a function of the signature sequences and average input-power constraints of the users.

However, the choice of the signature sequences of the users is left open to the designer of the CDMA system and it was suggested in [8] that the signature sequences could be optimized given the constraints of the problem. We address this issue and focus on finding the "sum capacity" (maximum sum of the rates of all users; maximum over all choices of signature sequences).
