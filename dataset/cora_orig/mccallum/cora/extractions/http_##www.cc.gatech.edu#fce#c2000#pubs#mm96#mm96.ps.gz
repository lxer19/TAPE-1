Abstract: We view college classroom teaching and learning as a multimedia authoring activity. The classroom provides a rich setting in which a number of different forms of communication co-exist, such as speech, writing and projected images. Much of the information in a lecture is poorly recorded or lost currently. Our hypothesis is that tools to aid in the capture and subsequent access of classroom information will enhance both the learning and teaching experience. To test that hypothesis, we initiated the Classroom 2000 project at Georgia Tech. The purpose of the project is to apply ubiquitous computing technology to facilitate automatic capture, integration and access of multimedia information in the educational setting of the university classroom. In this paper, we discuss various prototype tools we have created and used in a variety of courses and provide an initial evaluation of the acceptance and effectiveness of the technology. We also share some lessons learned in applying ubiquitous computing technology in a real setting.

Reference-contexts: The 10-week class met twice a week for 90 minute lectures <ref> [1] </ref>. There were 25 graduate students in the class representing a wide variety of disciplines across the Georgia Tech campus. We were unable to supply enough units to provide each student with a pen-based electronic notebook.

Reference-contexts: It is an interesting research question to ask how recorded information from the lecture (e.g., gestures gleaned from the video recording, segmenting the audio) can be processed to determine when audio links should be created and how they can meaningfully be attached to the material <ref> [2] </ref>. 5 EXPERIENCE AND INITIAL EVALUATION One of the major contributions of this work is its application in a large-scale educational setting. Table 1 summarizes the variety of experiences we have had so far in applying Classroom 2000 technology. <p> We see now the advantage of having tools that use natural actions of the teacher to automate the audio and video augmentation of Web pages, as described in <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. Such actions could include long pauses in their speech or mouse movements to draw attention to some area on the page. In the FCE seminar, we both videotaped and used the MessagePad outline-annotator.

Reference-contexts: We have also investigated paper-based solutions to note-taking, similar to the work done by Stifelman [14]. The implicit connection between the note-taking device and alternate information streams (audio and/or video) is a common theme that has also been explored at MIT's Media Lab [7] and at Apple <ref> [3] </ref>. 1 We have not made use so far of the ability to connect the LiveBoard to other remote information sources (or even the student notebooks in the same class), as is done in the DOLPHIN project [15] and other similar efforts.

Reference-contexts: We want to capture information provided by the teacher during a lecture, so electronic whiteboard capabilities provided by the Xerox LiveWorks LiveBoard <ref> [4] </ref> are inviting. 1 We also wanted to provide the students with an electronic notebook with the capability to take notes during the class that could be the basis for review after class.

Reference-contexts: The hardships incurred by this decision were far outweighed by the ease of cross-platform distribution, a must for our student population. This more active use of the Web infrastructure is in tune with some recent applications of WWW technology in education <ref> [8, 12, 5] </ref>. Our major contribution beyond this existing work is the concentration on in-class capture of information that is to be augmented through coordination with other classroom information via the Web.

Reference-contexts: Our work has been greatly influenced by the work at Xerox PARC in ubiquitous computing [18, 19] and tools to support electronic capture and access of collaborative activities <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. <p> The two most substantial evaluation studies have been conducted at PARC and Hew-lett-Packard. For a two-year period at PARC, a suite of tools for capture, automated indexing and integration, and access <ref> [9] </ref> was used to support a process of intellectual property management [10]. <p> We see now the advantage of having tools that use natural actions of the teacher to automate the audio and video augmentation of Web pages, as described in <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. Such actions could include long pauses in their speech or mouse movements to draw attention to some area on the page. In the FCE seminar, we both videotaped and used the MessagePad outline-annotator. <p> It has not included support for the user in accessing and modifying those notes. Work at Xerox PARC has identified tools to support this separate access phase <ref> [9] </ref> and we would be wise in the future to focus more effort there as well. 5.4.3 Access is critical In order to evaluate the effectiveness of Classroom 2000 technology, we have to have some guarantee that it is being used.

For a two-year period at PARC, a suite of tools for capture, automated indexing and integration, and access [9] was used to support a process of intellectual property management <ref> [10] </ref>. At Hewlett-Packard, the Filochat system was evaluated in field and laboratory studies, generating both qualitative information on the reaction of users to the technology and also quantitative information comparing the accuracy, efficiency and confidence of Filochat with paper-based and dicto-phone systems [20]. <p> This is similar to the Moran et al. notion of evolutionary engagement, in which the evolution of a tool is informed by its early adoption in a real-life-context <ref> [10] </ref>. Our constant drive to go live with various prototypes was the single greatest challenge we faced, and it comes with some risk given our educational focus. It is not an easy decision to experiment with education, as failure can have dire consequences. <p> We need to handle richer media sources at a finer level of granularity. For example, the student should be able to ask during review, "What was the lecturer saying when I wrote this?" while pointing to some arbitrary annotation, as in <ref> [10, 14, 20] </ref>. Or the student might want to find the notes associated with a live demonstration that occurred at some point in the class.

Reference-contexts: Conventions taught to note-takers can support time-stamping, but not without introducing an added burden and the chance for errors in the capture. This shortcoming could be removed through vision technology, such as demonstrated by the DigitalDesk <ref> [11] </ref>, or by anchoring the paper on a digitizing tablet, similar to the prototype developed by Stifelman [14]. Some students noted that they can type faster than they can write and that the typed-in information is immediately available for content-based search mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: We conclude in Section 6 with a discussion of how we have progressed toward our goal of introducing ubiquitous computing into the classroom and observing its effect on the educational experience. 2 RELATED WORK Shneiderman et al. <ref> [13] </ref> discuss the effects of introducing technology into the classroom in terms of the paradigm shifts that result. All of the existing systems they discuss, and all of the attempts we know of, have one common feature that we are trying to avoid.

Reference-contexts: Filochat used a pen-based PC to capture electronic annotations that served as indices into a digital audio stream. We have also investigated paper-based solutions to note-taking, similar to the work done by Stifelman <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> As the 9 quarter progressed, we altered the application by remov-ing the outline and allowing the user to bring up blank, time-stamped note pages for writing whatever came to mind. This simpler interface, similar in spirit to Stifel-man's audio notebook <ref> [14] </ref> was much less confusing to the user, but was only used in the class a few times. 5.4 Developer insights Our year of experience developing a number of Classroom 2000 prototypes has resulted in many valuable lessons and insights into ubiquitous computing and its application in an educational setting. <p> We need to handle richer media sources at a finer level of granularity. For example, the student should be able to ask during review, "What was the lecturer saying when I wrote this?" while pointing to some arbitrary annotation, as in <ref> [10, 14, 20] </ref>.

Some students noted that they can type faster than they can write and that the typed-in information is immediately available for content-based search mechanisms. We stayed away from keyboards because we felt the constant tapping of the keys would be a distraction in the class.
