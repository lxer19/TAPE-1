Abstract: We consider the problem of providing network access to hosts whose physical location changes with time. Such hosts cannot depend on traditional forms of network connectivity and routing because their location, and hence the route to reach them, cannot be deduced from their IP address. We present protocols that seamlessly integrate mobile hosts into the current IP networking infrastructure. They are primarily targeted at supporting a campus environment with mobile computers, but also extend gracefully to accomodate hosts moving between different networks. The key feature is the dependence on ancillary machines to track the location of the mobile hosts. Our protocols are designed to react quickly to changing topologies, to scale well, and not to place an overwhelming burden on the network.

Reference-contexts: Awerbuch and Peleg <ref> [AP89] </ref> discuss the use of a combination of forwarding pointers and router updates, with the cases of short-distance and long-distance moves used to determine the level of effort invested in updating routers: nearby routers are updated, faraway routers are not messages from faraway sites must be forwarded.

Reference-contexts: Peer MSS Discovery: When an MSS is asked to deliver a packet to an MH on another segment, it has to discover which MSS is responsible for that particular MH. It queues the packet and then multicasts <ref> [Dee89] </ref> a message to all the MSSs on the campus, asking them to respond if they are responsible for that MH. If the appropriate MSS is found, the packet is sent to the peer MSS using IPIP. An MSS may ask for more than one MH at a time.

Reference-contexts: However, the mode of operation is different, as there is one virtual circuit per phone, control is much more centralized, and the underlying network is different. Fowler has investigated the problem of general object movement in distributed systems. The paper abstracted from his dissertation <ref> [Fow86] </ref> gives a detailed analytical performance analysis of three different forwarding strategies. The strategies are for scenarios in which forwarding pointers form a tree; i.e., possibly many locations forward to the current location, which is the root of the 15 tree.

Reference-contexts: For example, access to system programs and libraries does not have to go through the entire IPIP process if there are copies of those resources available locally. There has been a lot of research and development on access of replicated resources (see, e.g., <ref> [Gif79] </ref>). It should be fairly easy to adapt most of these schemes to work in our idea of a mobile environment. 12 3 Evaluation Implementation of the protocols is still underway; no performance figures are available yet.
Reference: [MD90] <author> J. Mogul and S. Deering. </author> <note> Path MTU discovery. RFC 1191, </note> <month> November </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: Further research is needed on how frequent this problem will be, and if it proves to be a problem, how to dynamically modify the Path MTU (in a manner analogous to <ref> [MD90] </ref>) in order to limit it. MICP Time and Space Complexity: There are two kinds of MICP traffic: MSS configuration traffic and MH-related MICP messages. The first kind creates negligible traffic; MSSs change location very rarely.
Reference: [Pos81a] <author> Jon Postel. </author> <title> Internet Control Message Protocol. </title> <type> RFC 792, </type> <month> September </month> <year> 1981. </year>
Reference-contexts: If the MSS does not receive any MICP IHAVE replies after a certain number of retries, it gives up and sends an ICMP UNREACH HOST message <ref> [Pos81a] </ref> to the machine trying to reach the MH in question. Discovery of All MSSs On-Campus: As discussed above, in order for an MSS to deliver an IPIP datagram to another segment of the network, it must know the address of the MSS handling that particular segment or cell.
Reference: [Pos81b] <author> Jon Postel. </author> <title> Internet Protocol. </title> <type> RFC 791, </type> <month> September </month> <year> 1981. </year>
Reference-contexts: In a sense, it is equivalent to IP loose source routing <ref> [Pos81b] </ref>. When an IP datagram is received by the IP layer, it is first reassembled (if it was fragmented), and then the routing tables are consulted.

Reference-contexts: As it has already been explained, this would be highly undesirable and inefficient. The decision to keep one address protects higher-level software, and the overhead involved in maintaining the MSS structure is ostensibly lower than updating name servers. 4 Related Work As early as 1980, <ref> [SP80] </ref> described addressing of mobile hosts in the Arpanet environment. The approach was also that mobile hosts should be on their own virtual network, and a global (possibly distributed) database of mobile hosts in conjunction with source routing would take care of tracking moving hosts.

Reference-contexts: the size of the header in octets. 7 The benefit of our approach is that it does not rely on elaborate routing schemes, per-host routing on gateways, or on possibly poorly implemented options (loose source routing), and the amount of overhead involved is similar to other tunneling methods (see, e.g., <ref> [WPD88] </ref>). IPIP can also be used as a general-purpose protocol whenever IP-level encapsulation is needed. 2.5.2 The Mobile Internetworking Control Protocol The Mobile Internetworking Control Protocol is used by the MSSs to exchange control information, and by the MHs to signal to their respective MSSs that they have changed cells. <p> This scheme does not scale well as the number of mobile hosts increases. Our scheme maintains very little state for each mobile host, and uses caching and timeouts to keep the size of the location tables low. A form of tunneling is described in <ref> [WPD88] </ref>. The object is to use the Internet as a virtual network to deliver an IP datagram with a multicast (class-D) destination address between two networks separated by routers that do not know about multicast routing.
