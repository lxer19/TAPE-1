Abstract: Nikos Drakos' original manuscript was updated for version v96.1 by Herbert W. Swan &lt;lanhws@expl. aai.arco.com&gt; and converted for L A T E X 2 " by Michel Goossens &lt;goossens@cern.ch&gt;. Extensive revisions of the manuscript were made by Ross Moore &lt;ross@mpce.mq.edu.au&gt; for v96.1 rev-f, incorporating also suggestions from Michel Goossens. Another major revision was required to adequately describe the new features made possible with HTML 3.2 , and recent developments in image-generation and macro-handling. This work was done by Ross Moore, as were most of the revisions for v98.1. Changes for the v97.1 revision are indicated with narrow change-bars. Wider change-bars indicate where the most recent changes and features are described.

The special feature of minipage environments is in the way "footnote and "footnotemark commands are handled. These are numbered separately from the rest of the footnotes throughout the document, and the notes themselves are collected together to be displayed at the end of the minipage's contents. <p> Incomplete Cholesky factorization b ILU Incomplete LU factorization 2 a one footnote b another footnote The code used for this example was as follows 38 "begin-minipage--.9"textwidth "renewcommand-"thempfootnote--"alph-mpfootnote-- "begin-tabular--|l|l|- "hline "textbf-Variable- & "textbf-Meaning- "" "hline none & none "" Jacobi & $m$-step Jacobi iteration"footnote <ref> [1] </ref>-one footnote"" SSOR & $m$-step SSOR iteration"footnotemark [1] "" IC & Incomplete Cholesky factorization"footnote [2]-another footnote"" ILU & Incomplete LU factorization"footnotemark [2] "" "hline "end-tabular "end-minipage Warning: With some figures, especially when containing graphics imported using "includegraphics or other special macros, the background color may come out as a shade of grey, rather than white or transparent. <p> A hyperlink is created to that point in the text where the "index command occurred. 31 More sophisticated indexing is available by loading the makeidx package.
