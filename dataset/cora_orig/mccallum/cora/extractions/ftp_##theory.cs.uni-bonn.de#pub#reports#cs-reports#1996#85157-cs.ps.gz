Abstract: We describe an on-line algorithm for scheduling permanent jobs on related machines. It achieves the competitive ratio of 3 + p 8 5:828 for the deterministic version, and 3:31= ln 2:155 4:311 for its randomized variant, improving the previous competitive ratios of 8 and 2e 5:436.

Reference-contexts: Our task is to allocate a sequence of jobs to the machines in an on-line fashion, while minimizing the maximum load of the machines. This problem was solved with a competitive ratio 8 by Aspnes et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Later, it was noticed by Motwani [2] that by randomizing properly the key parameter of the original algorithm the expected competitive ratio can be reduced to 2e.
