Title: Reduced Motion Artifacts in Medical Imaging by Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction.  
Author: Dennis Healy, Tim Olson, and John Weaver 
Address: Hall  College, Hanover, NH 03755  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics, Bradley  Dartmouth  
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an algorithm for imaging a time varying object f(~x; t), from its projections at different fixed times. This algorithm differs from other algorithms in that we do not need the object to remain stationary during the data acquisition period. We show that the reconstruction of coarse features, corresponding to low spatial-frequency data, can be made nearly instantaneously in time from the evolving data. A temporal sequence of these low spatial-frequency reconstructions can be used to estimate the motion of the object. Once the motion is estimated, we may use the estimate to compensate for some of the motion of fine scale features. This enables accurate reconstructions of the time varying fine structure in several cases. The algorithm is demonstrated for a selection of phantoms and actual MRI studies. In general, this technique shows promise for a wide variety of applications in MRI, as well as for heart imaging using x-ray CT. Clinical applications should include both functional MRI such as dynamic imaging of oxygen usage and blood flow in the brain, and motion imaging of joints, angiography in the lungs, and heart imaging.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of factors which have contributed to this, the most prominent being the uncertainty of the phase information gathered via MR. There have been a number of recent attempts to alleviate these problems <ref> [16, 24] </ref>. In light of the advantages that projection reconstruction techniques seem to give for dealing with motion, we are very interested in increasing the reliability of our stationary imaging capability, because this should translate into increased realiability of our capacity to image moving structures.

Reference-contexts: To decide where the motion is predictable, one only needs to examine whether the incoming data from that region coincides with the data which the model would have predicted. Multidimensional Sampling Theory To understand this process we must revert to multidimensional sampling theory. As is explained in <ref> [21] </ref>, multidimensional sampling is equivalent to tiling the multidimensional Fourier transform of the sampled function g, with translated copies of the essential support of the Fourier transform of g. To avoid aliasing errors, one must make sure that these translated supports do not overlap.

Reference-contexts: Rigorous treatment of Spatial Localization In section IV we briefly outlined the spatial localization of MR data and noted that localization of MR data allows for gathering of fewer angular samples. This was done in a very loose, approximate manner, however. In <ref> [22] </ref> it was shown that data gathered in computerized tomography can be essentially localized, and precise error bounds were derived.

Reference-contexts: One should sample evenly in the new, transformed variables, where the range is classified optimally. This is equivalent to sampling more densely in the angular directions which correspond to the major axis of the original ellipse. This approach was suggested somewhat unsuccessfully in <ref> [25] </ref> for use on the limited angle tomography problem. These ideas do seem to be much more valid in this context, however, and much of the structure which was pointed out can be used here.

Reference-contexts: We believe that this type of technique will be helpful when trying to image structures, such as the heart, which change at speeds which are below current resolving capacities of MR scanners. Winding Projections We have been working on application of the MR sampling techniques outlined in <ref> [27] </ref> to our updating procedure. In [27] twisting lines through the origin of the Fourier transform are measured, which allows one to update a larger portion of the Fourier transform. This type of sampling scheme can easily be included in our update procedure. <p> Winding Projections We have been working on application of the MR sampling techniques outlined in <ref> [27] </ref> to our updating procedure.
