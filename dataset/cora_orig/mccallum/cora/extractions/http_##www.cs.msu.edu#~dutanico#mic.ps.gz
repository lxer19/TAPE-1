Reference-contexts: In order to incorporate the registration results into an automatic system for Point Distribution Model (PDM) <ref> [2, 7] </ref> training, one needs more than a similarity registration. A PDM describes the variance exhibited by the points of a set of training shape instances, and requires an exact registration especially for the corners of the shapes, otherwise the point variation information is lost.

Reference-contexts: There are several ways one can compute the values of the parameters a; b; c; d for which the minimum in Eq. (3) is attained <ref> [4, 17, 18] </ref>. We chose to solve a linear system of four equations in four unknowns (a; b; c; d) obtained by equating the partial derivatives of 2 to 0.

Reference-contexts: In order to incorporate the registration results into an automatic system for Point Distribution Model (PDM) <ref> [2, 7] </ref> training, one needs more than a similarity registration. A PDM describes the variance exhibited by the points of a set of training shape instances, and requires an exact registration especially for the corners of the shapes, otherwise the point variation information is lost. <p> To obtain such a fine tuning using a least squares distance criterion, one must allow deformations of the two sets of points. A natural way of introducing deformations <ref> [7, 8] </ref> is to separately register connected pieces of the initial contours. This is illustrated in Figs. 2d-3d and it is based on the a priori knowledge that both the model points and contour points are ordered along closed curves. <p> V. Experimental Results The algorithm presented above was used to automatically register the average brain model used in <ref> [7] </ref> (Fig.1c) to ten MR brain structure contours manually traced by physicians (Fig.1a-b).

Reference-contexts: The "brute force" solution for finding M that minimizes f (M ) is exponential in the size of A and B and cannot be used even for moderately large sets of points. On the other hand, stochastic (annealing type) algorithms that search the space of the M matrices <ref> [9, 15] </ref> may get stuck into local minima that are far from being acceptable solutions. Therefore, we chose to do a heuristic exploration of the space of the M matrices.

Reference-contexts: The images were acquired from 27 subjects and normalized using a three-dimensional proportional Talairach grid system <ref> [19] </ref>. Observer-defined contours identified by a neuroanatomist were available for all the images in the brain data set. Some of the results are shown in Figs. 2c), 3c), 4b) and 5b). The ten brain structures shown in Figs. 4-5 were registered separately before being overlayed.
