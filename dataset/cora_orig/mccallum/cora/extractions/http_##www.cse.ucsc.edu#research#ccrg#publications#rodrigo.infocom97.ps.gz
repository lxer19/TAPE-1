Abstract: The CARMA-NTG protocol is presented and analyzed. CARMA-NTG dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a group-transmission period. During the contention period, a station with one or more packets to send competes for the right to be added to the group of stations allowed to transmit data without collisions; this is done using a collision resolution splitting algorithm based on a request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) message exchange with non-persistent carrier sensing. CARMA-NTG ensures that one station is added to the group transmission period if one or more stations send requests to be added in the previous contention period. The group-transmission period is a variable-length train of packets, which are transmitted by stations that have been added to the group by successfully completing an RTS/CTS message exchange in previous contention periods. As long as a station maintains its position in the group, it is able to transmit data packets without collision. An upper bound is derived for the average costs of obtaining the first success in the splitting algorithm. This bound is then applied to the computation of the average channel utilization in a fully connected network with a large number of stations. These results indicate that collision resolution is a powerful mechanism in combination with floor acquisition and group allocation multiple access.

Reference-contexts: Variants of this basic strategy can be designed using different types 0 This work was supported in part by DARPA under Grants DAAB07-95-C-D157 and DAAH04-96-10210 of contention-based MAC protocols like ALOHA or CSMA to transmit RTS packets into the channel. We have recently shown <ref> [6] </ref> that collision resolution when applied to the RTS/CTS handshake used in many MAC protocols can improve the throughput of the system substantially. In this paper we describe and analyze a new channel access protocol that combines group allocation multiple access with collision resolution. <p> The analysis in this section uses the same traffic model as for the slotted CARMA protocol presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. It is assumed that there is an infinite number of stations forming a Poisson source sending RTSs (both new and retransmitted) with an aggregate mean generation rate of RTSs per unit time. Each station is assumed to have at most one RTS to transmit at any given time.

During these periods, multiple stations may sense the channel free and also send RTSs, thus causing collisions. As specified in <ref> [13] </ref>, GAMA protocols solve collisions by backing off and rescheduling RTS transmissions. As with CSMA protocols, this procedure yields good results if the RTS traffic is low; however, the probability of RTS collisions increases as the rate of RTS transmissions increases, with a corresponding decrease of system throughput. <p> CARMA-NTG is much more efficient than TDMA when there are only a few stations with packets to send . Our design and analysis is limited to fully connected wireless networks using a single channel. Our work continues to address more detailed analysis of performance of these types MAC protocols <ref> [13] </ref>, more sophisticated group allocation strategies, and the application of these type of protocols to networks with multiple hops and multiple channels.
