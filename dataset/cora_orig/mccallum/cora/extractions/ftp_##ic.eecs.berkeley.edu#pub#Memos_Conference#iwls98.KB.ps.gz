Abstract: We address three related issues on timing characterization of combinational modules. We first introduce a new notion called timing safe-replaceability as a way of comparing the timing characteristics of two combinational modules formally. This notion allows us to determine whether a new module is a safe replacement of an original module in terms of timing under any surrounding environment. Second, we consider false path detection of combinational modules. Although false path detection is essential to accurate delay modeling, we argue that the conventional definition of false paths is not appropriate for defining the falsity of a path for a combinational module since the falsity is relative to an arrival time condition. We introduce a new definition of false paths to resolve this issue. Finally, we propose a new algorithm that removes these false paths from a combinational module by a circuit transformation. We prove that the resulting circuit is a timing safe-replacement of the original.

Reference-contexts: This notion is a natural extension of the notion of safe replaceability in sequential circuits [10]. Aziz et al. <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a different notion of timing safe-replaceability, where each gate is given a minimum delay and a maximum delay, and a circuit is called timing safe-replaceable if and only if the delay of the output is completely contained in the delay range of the original circuit. <p> Our definition is more relaxed since the only delay property of interest is maximum delay. Therefore, speeding up a circuit preserves safe replaceability in our definition while it may not in <ref> [1] </ref>. Based on this theory one can safely determine when a combina tional module can be replaced with another without increasing the delay through the module under any environment. Consider a circuit M shown in Figure 1 taken from [2]. Assume the unit delay model.

Reference-contexts: We will discuss how to remove these by a circuit transformation without slowing down the circuit under any arrival time condition 2 . This is a generalization of the KMS algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> in the sense that the performance of the final circuit is guaranteed under any arrival time condition while it is only guaranteed for a particular arrival time condition in the original KMS algorithm. We will further show that the characterization of these 2 It is desirable to removefalse paths. <p> This implies that some path from x i of length L is responsible for determining the output under x. This contradicts that P (x i ; L) is v-false. 2 3 <ref> [3] </ref> only suggests that one pick the constant that gives better simplification of the circuit. However, they use this choice only as an optimization. Theorem 2 Suppose path set P (x i ; L) is v-false in M.

Reference-contexts: Although this analysis is computationally efficient, the resulting delay abstraction can be too conservative since the analysis completely ignores false paths inside the module. Recently, we have proposed a novel delay characterization technique for combinational modules, in which false paths inside the module are correctly identified <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. This provides a delay abstraction more accurate than the abstraction computed by topological delay, yet is still valid under any operating condition of the module.

Although topological analysis suffices in many cases, more accurate analysis is often required in the design of high-performance circuits. <ref> [4] </ref> shows that such elaborate analysis is possible by considering false paths in a circuit. This analysis leads to looser timing requirements at primary inputs, which can then relax the timing constraint of the circuit that drives the inputs. <p> This analysis leads to looser timing requirements at primary inputs, which can then relax the timing constraint of the circuit that drives the inputs. In the following, assume for simplicity that a combinational circuit under analysis has a single output. The basic idea of <ref> [4] </ref> is that given a combinational circuit and a required time at the primary output, the stability of the output at the required time can be represented by a Boolean function of the stability of primary inputs at potential required times. <p> Notice that the notion of required times is extended from a single value to a relation between input vectors and required times at primary inputs.

Interested readers should refer to [4]. Consider a single-output combinational circuit. Let X = fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g be the set of primary inputs of the circuit and z be the primary output. Assume that a required time t = 0 is asserted at z. <p> If topological analysis is performed, the required time at x i is l i , where l i is the longest topological path delay from x i to z.

The technique developed in <ref> [4] </ref> computes a more sophisticated input-vector-dependent constraint on required times, which is guaranteed to be looser than or equal to the one obtained by topological analysis. <p> However, since P (c; 6) is not 0-false, the substitution of 1 does not give a timing safe-replacement. Based on Theorem 2 one can design a procedure that takes a single-output combinational module and removes false paths to 4 See <ref> [4] </ref> for functions and their use in functional required time analysis. 5 The circuit is not 0-false, i.e. the longest path from the carry input to the carry output is sensitizable under some arrival time condition if the carry input has a value 0. 6 Note that the circuit is already
