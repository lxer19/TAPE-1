Abstract: We introduce a new powerful method of approximating the volume (and integrals) for a vast number of geometric body classes defined by boolean combinations of Pfaffian conditions. The method depends on the VC-Dimension of the class of bodies. The resulting approximation algorithms are quite different in spirit from the other up to now known methods, and give randomized solutions even for such seemingly untouchable problems of statistical physics like computing the volume of sets defined by the systems of exponential (or more generally Pfaffian) inequalities.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we exploit these results to give good randomized polynomial time algorithms for absolute approximation of various volumes and integrals defined "in the Pfaffian category". These algorithms are quite different in spirit from the well-known ones of Dyer, Freeze and Kannan <ref> [DFK91] </ref> and in many concrete cases are faster.

Reference-contexts: In analytic situations, this would give us access to manifolds, and not just affine spaces). There are two notable classes of examples: 1. is o-minimal [L92]. The largest current example, with enormous expressive power, is the theory of the real exponential field, with primitives for all restricted analytic functions <ref> [DMM94] </ref>; 2. T is the theory of p -adic field with primitives for all restricted analytic functions [DD88]. That this does not have the independence property 2 follows from [De84], [DD88] and [L92]. <p> One can give more elaborate examples, for richer structure on IR (using, e.g. the undefinability results in <ref> [DMM94] </ref> ). There is however the intriguing possibility that for some huge o-minimal structure on IR (*) is possible for definable E. This may have something to do with the error function. <p> In contrast to the situation for expressibility, where translation invariance was crucial, the randomized algorithm method works for Borel measures on compact fi -manifolds where fi is a geometric category <ref> [DMM94] </ref>, and in an analogous Pfaffian situation. In the latter case, fast algo rithms will exist, via [KM95]. Acknowledgment We thank Martin Dyer, Mark Jerrum, Pascal Koiran, Eduardo Sontag, and Andy Yao for many stimulating discussion. 10

Reference-contexts: The first of our results were obtained in October-November 1994 just prior to the Dagstuhl meeting on Neural Computing. In the real case they overlap with these of Pascal Koiran <ref> [K95] </ref>, with whom we had at Dagstuhl some technical discussions on approximate definition of volume via VC-dimension. 2 Measure and VC-Dimension 2.1 We assume familiarity with the basics about VC-dimension [AB92], [L92], [GJ93], with our paper [KM95], and the basics on approximating the volume of [DF88], [DFK91]. <p> Lemma 3 (#) holds for o-minimal M, and for the p -adic subanalytic case. 3 Proof Lemma 1. 2 A notable special case of Theorem 2, called "-nets, used in <ref> [K95] </ref>, is: Theorem 4 (Assumptions as in Theorem 3) If n 8d " log 13 " there is a subset fx 1 ; : : :; x n g of X such that for all C 2 C with P (C) ", C " fx 1 ; : : : ; <p> a subset fx 1 ; : : :; x n g of X such that for all C 2 C with P (C) ", C " fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g 6= ;. 3 A More General Version of Koiran's "Volume Approximation Formula" 3.1 Koiran <ref> [K95] </ref> works relative to a first-order structure on the IR including +; ; &lt; as primitives. Let L be the language involved. Koiran considers a measurable E IR p , a formula '(v) of L, and " &gt; 0 in IR. <p> There is however the intriguing possibility that for some huge o-minimal structure on IR (*) is possible for definable E. This may have something to do with the error function. Koiran <ref> [K95] </ref>, by two methods, proves results of the following shape: If E is definable, there is a formula '(AE) which defines an "-approximate volume for E.

The first is very elementary. 3.2 First Method It appears that Koiran here does not wish to appeal to o-minimality. <p> Let h be the probability measure on I P uniformly distributed on the N P vertices of the grid. By a simple Fubini argument Koiran proves the following, which for him generalizes the case of converse (E) = 1. j h (E) (E) j ph (E). Proof. See <ref> [K95] </ref>. We now quickly consider algorithmic aspects of this. To calculate h (E) one must simple N P points. Fix * &gt; 0, and let N be chosen so pk N &lt; * 4 . <p> We can interpret ( R Z ) P in the L-Structure, using representations in [0, 1 [. Let ; be the interpretations of the group operation, and the inverse. On ([0; 1 [) P these operations are quantifier-free defineable, using +, -, &lt;. Following Koiran <ref> [K95] </ref>, define, for k 2 N, and ; ff 2 I S ;ff = f (O 1 ; : : : O k ) 2 (I P ) k :j 1 P k (There is a hidden (uniform) dependence on ~ fi. <p> Moreover, the first block of 9's has length m, and the first block of 8's has length pk. Inside this there is a disjunction of m formulas S ;ff t i , essentially of length that of S ;ff . Korian's Theorem 4 <ref> [K95] </ref> is (essentially): Theorem 8 Let d VC-dim fi. Let m (16 log 26)d, and k max * 2 . Then C m (; * 2 ) defines an *-approximate volume for E ~ fi . <p> In <ref> [K95] </ref> Koiran shows that d c fl d 0 fl k log k, where C is an absolute constant and d 0 is the VC-dimension of the family O E ~ fi . <p> That is, you cannot just substitute real r for in j (E) j&lt; * and make sense inside IQ p . We propose the following modification. We follow the notations of <ref> [K95] </ref>, except that we replace I by V. V is now an additive group, so we avoid the details of interpretability. We work in a power ((IQ p ) t ) k as before (replacing p by t for obvious reasons!). <p> The least distance between these numbers is 1 k , and,if E V , (E) is no more than 1 k from some j k . If 1 4 , then (E) is within * 4 of some unique j k . Now we can just follow Koiran's notation <ref> [K95] </ref> prior to his Theorem 4.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [KM95] </ref> we gave a powerful method for estimating VC-dimension of classes defined by Boolean combinations of C 1 (infinitely differentiable) conditions f (v) &gt; 0. <p> In the real case they overlap with these of Pascal Koiran [K95], with whom we had at Dagstuhl some technical discussions on approximate definition of volume via VC-dimension. 2 Measure and VC-Dimension 2.1 We assume familiarity with the basics about VC-dimension [AB92], [L92], [GJ93], with our paper <ref> [KM95] </ref>, and the basics on approximating the volume of [DF88], [DFK91]. We refer to [H50] for the most basic notions of the measure theory, and to [H76] for the basic notions from differential topology. <p> That this does not have the independence property 2 follows from [De84], [DD88] and [L92]. A conspicuous difference between (1) and (2) is that in (1) one has good bounds for VC-Dim (C) in many cases <ref> [KM95] </ref>, whereas in (2) one has no good bounds so far. There are also important cases where one has good bounds for VC-dimension without knowing any general result about lack of the independence property.

There are also important cases where one has good bounds for VC-dimension without knowing any general result about lack of the independence property. The most important examples are in [KM95] for C defined by boolean combinations of f (v; ~ fi) &gt; 0, for f being Pfaffian [K91]. <p> In the quantifier free Pfaffian case, Khovanskii's method applies, as in <ref> [KM95] </ref>. 3.3 The Translation Method We maintain the preceding notation. The translation method is more subtle, and very congenial to a modeltheorist who defines generic types in terms of group translation [P83]. The idea is of course to derandomize the sampling algorithm by relating generic and of large measure. <p> Note that this estimate is valid before we impose the constraints in Theorem 8. d 0 can be nicely estimated in some cases where is quantifier-free, and in the semi-algebraic case quite generally, using refined results on quantifier-elemination [GJ93]. Let us briefly recall the most notable result <ref> [KM95] </ref>: Suppose (~; ~w) is a Boolean combination of s many formulas f i (~; ~w) &gt; 0; 1 i s where each f i is a polynomial of degree in ~; ~w and q many (q independent of i) ff (~; ~w) which occur in a Pfaffian chain of length <p> Here there is an interesting problem of taking account of variation in s. We hope to return to this in a later publication. 5 Randomized Algorithms 5.1 For us the main significance of our results <ref> [KM95] </ref> is that they lead to powerful randomized algorithms in a wide range of geometric problems with Pfaffian data. There is a noticeable difference between this approach and that of, say, Dyer-Freeze-Kannan [DFK91] who have as data blackboxes for arbitrary convex bodies, and are concerned with relative approximation. <p> We restrict to sets definied by quantifier-free conditions in the language with primitives for all total Pfaffian functions. 5.2 For us a typical fi is defined by a Boolean combination of conditions f i (~; ~w) &gt; 0 as in <ref> [KM95] </ref>, where the f i are polynomials of degree in ~; ~w and q many Pfaffian functions occuring in a chain of length q and degree D. Our bound for VC-dim (fi) [KM95], following [K91, p. 91] is q (q 1) + 2l log + 2 (l + q) log ( <p> typical fi is defined by a Boolean combination of conditions f i (~; ~w) &gt; 0 as in <ref> [KM95] </ref>, where the f i are polynomials of degree in ~; ~w and q many Pfaffian functions occuring in a chain of length q and degree D. Our bound for VC-dim (fi) [KM95], following [K91, p. 91] is q (q 1) + 2l log + 2 (l + q) log ( + D) + 2l log (l + 1) + (16 + 2 log sl), in which k doesn't occur. Let d be the above estimate. <p> In contrast to the situation for expressibility, where translation invariance was crucial, the randomized algorithm method works for Borel measures on compact fi -manifolds where fi is a geometric category [DMM94], and in an analogous Pfaffian situation. In the latter case, fast algo rithms will exist, via <ref> [KM95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the real case they overlap with these of Pascal Koiran [K95], with whom we had at Dagstuhl some technical discussions on approximate definition of volume via VC-dimension. 2 Measure and VC-Dimension 2.1 We assume familiarity with the basics about VC-dimension [AB92], <ref> [L92] </ref>, [GJ93], with our paper [KM95], and the basics on approximating the volume of [DF88], [DFK91]. We refer to [H50] for the most basic notions of the measure theory, and to [H76] for the basic notions from differential topology. <p> Our usual setting will involve a set X and a class C of subsets of X, of finite VC-dimension d (VC-Dim (C) = d). Model theory provides a wide selection of such X and C. If is a theory without the independence property (cf. <ref> [L92] </ref>), and M is any model C, we get X and C as follows: X = M k , some k; C is the class of all subsets of M k defined by OE (AE 1 ; : : : ; AE k ; fi 1 ; : : : ; <p> For this see <ref> [L92] </ref>, where (astronomical) bounds on VC-Dim (C) are established. (We note that one can generalize significantly. X could be a set interpretable in M. In analytic situations, this would give us access to manifolds, and not just affine spaces). There are two notable classes of examples: 1. is o-minimal [L92]. <p> see <ref> [L92] </ref>, where (astronomical) bounds on VC-Dim (C) are established. (We note that one can generalize significantly. X could be a set interpretable in M. In analytic situations, this would give us access to manifolds, and not just affine spaces). There are two notable classes of examples: 1. is o-minimal [L92]. The largest current example, with enormous expressive power, is the theory of the real exponential field, with primitives for all restricted analytic functions [DMM94]; 2. T is the theory of p -adic field with primitives for all restricted analytic functions [DD88]. <p> T is the theory of p -adic field with primitives for all restricted analytic functions [DD88]. That this does not have the independence property 2 follows from [De84], [DD88] and <ref> [L92] </ref>. A conspicuous difference between (1) and (2) is that in (1) one has good bounds for VC-Dim (C) in many cases [KM95], whereas in (2) one has no good bounds so far. <p> can always be instantiated by a tuple independent of and ~ fi. (This follows easily by the *-net argument.) The (unsolved) problem is to find this tuple. 3.4 p-adic version Delon [De89] proved that the field IQ p does not have the independence property, and from this, using [DD88] and <ref> [L92] </ref>, one easily deduces that IQ p with the subanalytic structure of van den Dries-Denef also does 7 not have the independence property. This of course gives finiteness of VC--dimension for families of sets interpretable in IQ p with subanalytic structure.

Reference-contexts: In the quantifier free Pfaffian case, Khovanskii's method applies, as in [KM95]. 3.3 The Translation Method We maintain the preceding notation. The translation method is more subtle, and very congenial to a modeltheorist who defines generic types in terms of group translation <ref> [P83] </ref>. The idea is of course to derandomize the sampling algorithm by relating generic and of large measure. As before, the procedure is uniform in ~ fi, so we write E for E ~ fi .

Reference-contexts: So there is a slight gain over the earlier formula. But, if one tries, in the semi-algebraic case, to eliminate quantifiers a la Renegar <ref> [R92] </ref>, the cost is great, because the block of 8's has length kp, leading to a time cost exponential in p and 1 * 2 . (d) Though it seems to be of no practical importance, it is interesting to note that for fixed *, and j (E ~ fi )
