Reference-contexts: An attractive feature of CSMA protocols is that they are simple to implement; however, because a station must contend before it transmits each packet, CSMA and ALOHA <ref> [1] </ref> are unstable under heavy loads. Furthermore, in the presence of hidden terminals, CSMA's performance degrades to that of ALOHA. <p> Media Access Control (MAC) protocols control access to a shared channel. Over the years many different MAC protocols have been developed. The most important difference among these protocols is how often they allow a node to access the transmission channel; the extremes range from ALOHA <ref> [1] </ref> which allows a node to transmit at any time, to Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) which divides the channel into slots that are preallocated to each node. <p> In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss several MAC protocols that have been proposed for packet radio, multi-tapped bus or hub and wavelength division multiplexing networks. 2.1.1 Packet Radio Networks One of the early MAC protocols, ALOHA <ref> [1] </ref>, was developed in 1970 to provide data communication between the campuses of the University of Hawaii. This protocol allows stations to transmit at will.

Reference-contexts: In this class of protocols, stations compete to either reserve the right to transmit a single packet, or the right to become members of a transmission schedule. There are many recent examples of the first class of protocols <ref> [2, 4, 13, 16, 25, 30] </ref>. <p> FAMA protocols that use carrier sensing (e.g., FAMA-NCS [14]) have good performance in networks with hidden terminals, but carrier sensing is not available in several commercial spread spectrum radios. Protocols that resolve RTS collisions based on auctions or tree-splitting algorithms (e.g., RAMA <ref> [2] </ref>, TRAMA [31]) require either carrier sensing or time slotting to achieve good performance. Some protocols require the base station to detect multiple simultaneous transmissions (e.g. RAMA, PRMA) to provide feedback to the nodes; however, this is not a common feature in spread spectrum radios. <p> More recently, another category of demand assignment protocols based on auctioning resources has been proposed. Protocols defined in <ref> [2, 31] </ref> auction slots within a transmission cycle one at a time until either there are no more slots available or there are no more bidders; these protocols are designed primarily for wireless networks, and require the use of a base station capable of understanding simultaneous transmissions. 11 2.1.5 Distributed Transmission

Reference-contexts: This switching time makes a packet-switched WDM network possible.

Each node in the network receives every message sent along the control channel; this allows the individual nodes to maintain a consistent view of the current network state.

There are many recent examples of the first class of protocols <ref> [2, 4, 13, 16, 25, 30] </ref>. <p> Many of today's commercially available packet radios do not have the ability to detect carrier. Accordingly, the MAC protocol for these radios must rely on packet sensing. Packet sensing consists of acting on the reception of entire packets. Some feel <ref> [13, ?] </ref> that the use of carrier sensing does not improve upon the efficiency of a MAC protocol because carrier sensing presents information on the state of the channel (whether or not another station is transmitting) at the source not at the destination.

Reference-contexts: Prior protocols that use packet sensing (i.e., detecting an entire RTS correctly) have poor performance because the time periods of RTS contentions can be very long; examples of these protocols are MACA [30] 3 and MACAW [4]. FAMA protocols that use carrier sensing (e.g., FAMA-NCS <ref> [14] </ref>) have good performance in networks with hidden terminals, but carrier sensing is not available in several commercial spread spectrum radios. Protocols that resolve RTS collisions based on auctions or tree-splitting algorithms (e.g., RAMA [2], TRAMA [31]) require either carrier sensing or time slotting to achieve good performance. <p> Therefore, a station using carrier sensing might incorrectly back-off from a transmission because it detects traffic on the channel even though the channel might be clear at the destination. It has been shown conclusively in that carrier sensing does improve the efficiency of a MAC protocol <ref> [14] </ref>. One of the most difficult problems in designing MAC protocols for multi-hop packet-radio networks is that of "hidden terminals". Hidden terminals exist when two or more stations can communicate with a third station, but not with each other.

Recent examples of dynamic reservation protocols that build a transmission schedule include DQRAP [62], CARMA-NTG <ref> [17] </ref> and GAMA [43]. The throughput of these protocols under high load approaches the channel capacity, provided that either carrier sensing or time slotting is used.

Reference-contexts: Because of the instability under heavy loads of basic contention-based protocols, many contention-free protocols have been proposed; these include fixed assignment (in time or frequency), polling, token passing or dynamic reservations. Fixed assignment protocols are typically based on TDMA (e.g., <ref> [18] </ref>). In a TDMA network, time is divided into frames that provide each node with a transmission slot over which it can transmit data without collisions. A limitation of TDMA is that the channel is wasted when traffic is bursty.

Reference-contexts: Current tunable transmitters and receivers all suffer from one of two problems: either the tuning time is too long, or the active range is too small. The commercially available (wide range) receivers require millisecond tuning times which is unacceptable for a viable packet switched network. A fast tunable laser <ref> [20] </ref> was demonstrated to switch between wavelengths in less than 8 ns; this laser was able to 107 tune to 24 discrete frequencies. This switching time makes a packet-switched WDM network possible.

Reference-contexts: During the contention period stations contend for membership in the "transmission group"; each group member is able to transmit data without collision during the tranmission period allocated to the station when it joined the transmission group. GAMA/CD uses a form of "limited sensing" as in <ref> [24] </ref> to allow a newly activated station to contend for group membership without knowing the entire state of the transmission group. When a station receives a message to transmit, it listens to the channel for 2t seconds, where t is the maximum end-to-end propagation delay.

Reference-contexts: Many demand assignment MAC protocols have been designed to use some form of reservations, an example of one of the early reservation protocols is described in <ref> [26] </ref>. In this protocol, the transmission channel is divided into frames, a frame begins with a set of mini-slots which are followed by a variable number of fixed-length data slots.

Reference-contexts: Existing media access control (MAC) protocols can be divided into two groups: contention-based and contention-free. A contention-based protocol requires a station to compete for control of the transmission channel each time it sends a packet. In the past, CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) protocols <ref> [37] </ref> have been used in several packet-radio networks; CSMA protocols attempt to prevent a station from transmitting simultaneously with other 2 stations (within its transmission range) by asking it to listen before it transmits. <p> Therefore, m can be expressed as m = P m1 (3.11) The average number of group members is 23 m X j j (3.12) If multiple RTSs collide, the value of Y represents the length of the overlap between colliding packets. This value is shown in <ref> [37] </ref> to equal: Y = t The probability P r that an RTS (once sent) is successful is equal to the probability that no other messages arrive within t seconds of the start of transmission, i.e., P r = e t (3.14) A busy contention period can result in either a <p> We describe how GAMA-PS provides dynamic reservations of the channel and shows that its implementation complexity is comparable with that of CSMA <ref> [37] </ref> protocols. Like GAMA-CS, GAMA-PS builds a dynamically-sized "cycle" that grows and shrinks depending upon traffic demand. Each cycle consists of a contention period of up to a maximum duration and a group-transmission period during which one or more stations transmit data packets without collisions. <p> When a contention period produces an error, the length of the contention period is equal to Y + 3t . Where Y represents the length of the overlap between colliding initial packets. This value as shown in <ref> [37] </ref> can be represented as: Y = t The 3t seconds represents the time before colliding stations realize a collision has occured plus the length of the jamming packet and the propagation delay for the jamming packet to reach the other stations.

Reference-contexts: There are many variations of DLC layers, some of them do not request that packets sent in error be retransmitted, and other versions ensure that packets being sent to the network layer are in order. In many networks, data transmissions occur on a shared medium (e.g., ethernet <ref> [41] </ref>) In such multi-access networks, 7 multiple nodes may transmit simultaneously. Therefore, a received signal may be a combination of multiple transmissions, and, shared-medium networks often have an additional sub-layer inserted among the DLC and the physical layers.

Reference-contexts: A distributed transmission queue is an ordered list of the nodes awaiting access to the transmission channel; this list must be maintained by all nodes to eliminate the possibility of collisions. The most widely known protocol using distributed transmission queues is Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) <ref> [50] </ref>. In DQDB, the network nodes communicate with each other over two buses. A node must be connected to each of them; the traffic along these buses flows in opposite directions.

Reference-contexts: This switching time makes a packet-switched WDM network possible. However, many of the channel access protocols for WDM networks presented to date require a channel for each network node [8, 7, 23]. This severely limits the size of the network, considering that 144x144 port star couplers have been demonstrated <ref> [51] </ref>. For this reason, we focus on WDM networks with more nodes than data channels. The Transmitter Tune Ahead Scheduling (TTAS) algorithm is a member of the family of WDM protocols presented in [28, 29]. <p> Furthermore, the protocols impose no requirements on the number of transmission channels, and guarantee that there are no receiver or channel collisions. Like other channel access protocols for WDM networks <ref> [8, 28, 51] </ref> DQMW uses a separate control channel for coordinating the transmission of data messages. Each node in the network receives every message sent along the control channel; this allows the individual nodes to maintain a consistent view of the current network state.

Reference-contexts: The access rate for a user of an optical network is limited by electronic speeds, which are only a few gigabits per second <ref> [52] </ref>; a WDM network allows for a more efficient use of the enormous capacity of an optical link by allowing concurrent transmissions. The nodes of a WDM network can be arranged around a passive star coupler using a broadcast-and-select transmission policy.

Reference-contexts: When a collision occurs, the network efficiency decreases because a transmission which is involved in a collision is received by the destination as an error. A variation of ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA <ref> [54] </ref> uses slots to improve upon the efficiency of ALOHA. Slotting divides the transmission channel into discreet units; depending upon the protocol, the slots may be fixed or variable in length.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, most ad-hoc networks use a contention-based MAC protocol for controlling channel access, and therefore, are not stable under all conditions. The most difficult problem associated with ad-hoc networks is that of "hidden terminals" <ref> [58] </ref>; hidden terminals exist when two or more stations can communicate with a third station, but not with each other. In Fig. 5.1 both stations C and E can communicate with station D but not with each other; thus, transmissions from stations C and E are hidden. <p> In Fig. 5.1 both stations C and E can communicate with station D but not with each other; thus, transmissions from stations C and E are hidden. Several approaches have been used to solve this problem. The Busy Tone Multiple Access (BTMA) protocol <ref> [58] </ref> divides the transmission channel into a busy-tone channel and a message channel. BTMA uses a base-station to transmit a busy-tone signal for as long at it senses carrier on the message channel.

Reference-contexts: The nodes in a wired LAN are able to detect collisions on the transmission channel.Collision detection allows a node to recognize when another transmission is interfering with one of its own. A variation of CSMA called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection CSMA/CD <ref> [59] </ref>, uses collision detection to limit the length of an error period caused by the collision of multiple transmissions. 2.1.3 WDM Networks In a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network, each node is connected to a passive star coupler via optical fiber.

Reference-contexts: Some protocols require the base station to detect multiple simultaneous transmissions (e.g. RAMA, PRMA) to provide feedback to the nodes; however, this is not a common feature in spread spectrum radios. Recent examples of dynamic reservation protocols that build a transmission schedule include DQRAP <ref> [62] </ref>, CARMA-NTG [17] and GAMA [43]. The throughput of these protocols under high load approaches the channel capacity, provided that either carrier sensing or time slotting is used.
