Abstract: These two fields do not span the entire four-dimensional configuration space, but as Nelson shows, the closure of these two fields under Lie products permits any motion to be approximated arbitrarily closely. Let S(t) and D(t) be the ows generated by Steer and Drive, respectively. Each of these ows constitutes a semigroup. The semigroup S of motions of the car is generated by these two semigroups, together with a set of commutation relations relating S and D, e.g., if the driver turns the wheels a certain angle then drives a certain distance, the car ends up where it started. Choose a small piece of this configuration space, such as a square Q large enough for the car to maneuver to reach every configuration in the square. Analyzing Greens relations for these ows, we see that each D-class corresponds to a class of curves with the same endpoints and convex hull. For example, in Figure 5, the path drawn in bold is in the same D-class as all the other paths with the same endpoints that lie completely within its convex hull (dotted lines). constant that return to their starting point. This structure is reminiscent of homotopy classes, except that curves of constant turning are used instead of curves of minimum length as the representatives of the classes. The inner automor-phisms of these spheres are the rotational symmetries, and factoring by this group again gives the familiar decomposition of planning the cars motion into planning position and then planning rotation. The vector field for position changes Steer, the control that modifies , was already stated as an independent vector field, and thus planning turns of the steering wheel is a third component of the decomposition. This component was not present in the discretized mobile robot. Synthesis in the new representation is done by synthesizing the path in the x and y dimensions, e.g., avoiding Identification of the local invariants and symmetries of a domain theory yields a reformulation of the theory, and the identification of a set of implementation-independent invariants that characterize the theory. The definition of coordinate systems for semigroups yields a means of identifying these local symmetries. This analysis is expensive, but can be performed on small, simple systems, yielding a domain theory that can be reused on an infinite class of tasks. This is a step in addressing the crucial issue of designing tractable problem solving techniques that scale up to large problems. Benjamin, D. Paul, (1992a).
