Reference-contexts: Model correction in lumped-parameter representations, such as differential equations, has been concentrated in estimating the global parameters based on available data. More specifically, the model correction is achieved by minimizing the cost function <ref> [1] </ref>: C = i where summation is over all available data points; y i is the output value for input vector x i ; the f (x i ; fi) is the model to be trained through adjusting the model parameters fi; L (^y i ; y i ) is general <p> Equation (6.1)) and that of the local model is that the cost function of the local model is weighted to emphasize nearby points for a query point q. The cost function is <ref> [1] </ref>: C (q) = i 44 between 0.2A and 0.3A. The error is in m=s 2 , which is the unit of acceleration. <p> The locally weighted regression using constant model is also called kernel regression. Taking dC d^y = 0 will give the minimum cost function; the corresponding ^y is given by <ref> [1] </ref>: ^y = s y i K (d (x i ; q)) s K (d (x i ; q)) where the summation is over the entire data set s. <p> In these cases, further interpolation is needed to decide if each unknown cell is closer to the controlled trajectory or uncontrolled trajectory. The method of locally weighted regression (LWR) <ref> [1] </ref> can be employed for the interpolation.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION 1.1 Motivation The linear control theories and design methods are well developed. Given a linear plant to be controlled, a controller for the plant can be designed with the existing conventional tools and knowledge <ref> [4, 7, 16] </ref>. Unfortunately, most real physical plants possess nonlinearities, and are not directly solvable using linear control methods. Therefore, a control engineer normally needs to first approximate the nonlinear plant using a linear model, and then design a linear controller based on the linear model.

Reference-contexts: This type of design is called emulation. There are various ways of finding the discrete equivalent; some of them are forward rectangular rule, backward rectangular rule, trapezoidal rule, zero-pole mapping, and hold equivalence <ref> [8] </ref>. The trapezoidal rule is employed here for its simplicity and its guarantee of stable discrete system provided the continuous counterpart is stable.

Reference-contexts: Due to the aforementioned limitations of linear controllers, there are many attempts to design nonlinear controllers. Some of the nonlinear controller design methods are describing function, feedback linearization, sliding mode, gain scheduling, and fuzzy controller <ref> [14, 13, 17] </ref>. Most 1 nonlinear controller designs are based on analytical methods. For example, the feed-back linearization transforms the nonlinear system so that analytical linear controller design methods can be used. <p> These facts limit the use of analytical methods in nonlinear control design. Also, some nonlinear methods, such as gain scheduling, which require linear model approximations for capturing local behaviors, tend to lose sight of nonlinear global behaviors such as limit cycle, multiple isolated equilibria, and almost-periodic oscillation <ref> [13] </ref>. In short, although the conventional nonlinear control methods have their merits in certain classes of nonlinear systems, the limitations described above certainly suggest the need for other nonlinear control methods. An alternative in nonlinear control is phase space based control.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION 1.1 Motivation The linear control theories and design methods are well developed. Given a linear plant to be controlled, a controller for the plant can be designed with the existing conventional tools and knowledge <ref> [4, 7, 16] </ref>. Unfortunately, most real physical plants possess nonlinearities, and are not directly solvable using linear control methods. Therefore, a control engineer normally needs to first approximate the nonlinear plant using a linear model, and then design a linear controller based on the linear model. <p> The following sections present nonlinear and linear models of the maglev system for the global and local controller designs, respectively. The derivation of the models is partially based on the work of Shahian <ref> [16] </ref>. The basic components of the maglev system are shown in Figure 3.1 (b). <p> The experiment's objective is to suspend the metal ball at a specified distance away from the bottom tip of the magnetic coil. 3.1 Nonlinear Model The steel ball in the electro-magnetic field is subject to the electro-magnetic force, f m , described by <ref> [16] </ref>: f m = 2 dx where i denotes the current in the solenoid, x denotes the displacement of the steel ball away from the bottom tip of the solenoid core, and L is the total inductance which consists of inductances of the solenoid and the steel ball. <p> Note f m is in the 13 (a) The photo of the physical experiment (b) The basic components direction as labeled in Figure 3.1 (b). The total inductance can be further modeled as <ref> [16] </ref>: L b x o : L s is the solenoid inductance, a fixed quantity. L b is the steel ball inductance when the ball is at the equilibrium distance x o . <p> In phase space control, the states are assumed measurable or observable using state estimation methods. 3.1.2 Voltage-Controlled Maglev System The electrical circuitry of the maglev system can be modeled as a series resistor-inductor configuration <ref> [16] </ref> as shown in Figure 3.2. Using KVL, the voltage-current relationship is: v in = Ri + L (x) dt For simplicity of analysis, assume the ball is close to the equilibrium point, i.e. x = x o ; thus L (x) = L s + L b . <p> 2 i inc : (3.8) The net force on the ball is the acceleration times the ball mass m: mx = f 0 Since we are interested in incremental change of the resistor-inductor circuit of di inc = L s Each of the photo cell sensors can be modeled with <ref> [16] </ref>: v s = fix: Its incremental model is: v s=inc = fix inc : (3.11) Equation (3.8), (3.9), (3.10), and (3.11) form the linear model that is sufficient for describing the maglev system near the equilibrium point. 3.2.1 Current-Controlled Maglev System The transfer function from the solenoid current input to

Recent investigations on the application of phase space 2 based control can be found in references <ref> [26, 5, 25, 23, 24, 18, 11, 10] </ref>.

For the second objective, we have developed algorithms and methods to characterize the performance of the maglev system. <p> Then, we illustrate in more detail phase space analysis and control in the context of the spatial aggregation [3, 2, 22], a unified approach to processing image-like data fields. Finally, we present the phase space control trajectory design, an algorithm devised by May <ref> [26] </ref> who is the author's collaborator in the phase space control project. 2.1 The Essence of Phase Space Control Consider a time-invariant dynamical system modeled by _x = f (x; u) (2.1) where x is the state variable vector, and u is the scalar input. <p> It turns out that the spatial aggregation framework itself is a convenient way of illustrating the phase space control. Therefore, we describe the phase space analysis and control by spelling out the functionality of the operators following the presentation in reference <ref> [26] </ref>. For simplicity, we study only the regulatory control, which aims at stabilizing a system at a desired equilibrium point (i.e a goal state). The following are the spatial aggregation operators: Aggregation Given the multi-slice phase space description as input, operator Aggregate constructs neighborhood relationship in the phase space. <p> When an optimal path is found, the corresponding sequence of cells and the associated control inputs are updated to a control table for run time look-up. of spatial aggregation. 2.3 Control Path Design: An Algorithm The algorithm is developed by May <ref> [26] </ref> as part of the joint investigation of the phase space control and its applications. The algorithm determines the optimal control paths from all controllable cells in the phase space to the goal cell. The plant is 9 spatial aggregation (from [26]). <p> Design: An Algorithm The algorithm is developed by May <ref> [26] </ref> as part of the joint investigation of the phase space control and its applications. The algorithm determines the optimal control paths from all controllable cells in the phase space to the goal cell. The plant is 9 spatial aggregation (from [26]). The phase spaces, parameterized by different control inputs, are aggregated to form a neighborhood graph. <p> Knowing the state of the maglev system, the run time global controller 2 outputs control actions to the maglev system by simply looking up the table. The algorithm consists of three main steps as described in reference <ref> [26] </ref>: 1. Partition the phase space into cellular regions 3 . 2. Compute the graph of cell adjacencies.
