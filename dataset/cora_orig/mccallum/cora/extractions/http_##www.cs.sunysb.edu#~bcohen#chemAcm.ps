Reference-contexts: Proof: Clearly the problem is in NP. To show hardness, we use a reduction from "covering by complete bipartite subgraphs" <ref> [6] </ref>, which which asks whether there is a cover of the edges of a bipartite graph G by k complete bipartite subgraphs (cliques). <p> Hence there is a k covering of G iff there exists a G 0 with k 0 vertices. Thus optimizing split-synthesis automata is intimately related to covering or partitioning the edges of a graph by complete bipartite subgraphs (bipartite cliques) <ref> [6] </ref>. Given a fixed graph G, and a class of graphs H, the minimum number of H-subgraphs which cover the edges of G is denoted cov (G; H). Results on bounding this minimum value for various H are surveyed by Pyber [3, 14].

Reference-contexts: Each s 2 S is represented by at least one path in G 2. The total number of distinct labelled paths through G is R. It is important to note that our problem is not the same as minimizing a DFA|a well-studied problem for which efficient algorithms are known <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The optimizer also takes as input a desired number of strings in the output. The optimizer outputs an abstract representation of the synthesis process in the form of a dag, various statistics on the dag and also a dot file <ref> [8] </ref> which is suitable for displaying pictures of small dags. * The scheduler takes a dagfile as input, and various parameters of the laboratory setting. Most important is the number of grow operations which can be performed in parallel.

Reference-contexts: Split synthesis, developed independently by Furka [5] and Lam <ref> [9] </ref>, is the method of choice to build libraries for combinatorial chemistry. The basis of this technology is that molecules can be grown with one end tethered to a resin bead, while the other end is extended one residue at time in parallel across a set of beads.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Combinatorial chemistry is one of the most exciting recent developments in drug discovery, the foundations of which rest on the systematic synthesis and screening of large libraries of small molecules. In the standard one-bead, one-compound approach <ref> [11] </ref> to combinatorial chemistry, a large number of distinct small molecules are fabricated on distinct resin beads. These beads are reacted against a target to establish which beads contain biologically active agents. The compound associated with a positively-reacting bead can then be identified via sequencing or indirect coding methods. <p> For example, full libraries of all l-peptides cannot be fabricated for l 6, since there are 20 l distinct molecules containing l amino acid residues. In response, techniques for constructing representatives for all of a simple set of motifs have been developed using random synthesis steps <ref> [11] </ref>. However, the sophistication and hence effectiveness of such libraries is limited by the difficulty of designing cost-effective synthesis strategies. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmicly-intensive optimized split-synthesis technology for fabricating combinatorial chemistry libraries and evaluate its potential through extensive simulation. <p> We believe our methods hold promise in synthesizing libraries which are (1) too large to reasonably employ sequential synthesizers (say greater than 50 distinct molecules), (2) too long or irregular for conventional split-synthesis generation techniques <ref> [11] </ref>, and (3) not used in production quantities|thus making array-based synthesis techniques [4] economically unviable. Split synthesis, developed independently by Furka [5] and Lam [9], is the method of choice to build libraries for combinatorial chemistry.

Reference-contexts: The communications complexity of a graph G is the minimum number of bipartite cliques to cover all its edges, and is bounded between log rank (G) and rank (G). See Lovasz <ref> [12] </ref> for details. In light of the application to split synthesis and the hardness of partitioning bipartite graphs into bipartite cliques, it is interesting to establish how much one must restrict the permitted degree of the vertices to make the problem tractable.
