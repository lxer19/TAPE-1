Reference-contexts: They also presented results suggesting that it is prone to a systematic bias with respect to occupancy. While the controversy surrounding single-trap loop detector speed estimates has yet to be resolved, they have nevertheless been shunned by the transportation research community. Dailey <ref> (Dailey, 1993) </ref> uses cross-correlation of the flow at the upstream and downstream detectors to estimate travel time between two single-trap loop detectors placed 0.5 miles apart. Dailey aggregates flow to five second intervals prior to cross-correlation.

Reference-contexts: The factor of g simply converts occupancy to density. Hall and Persaud <ref> (Hall and Persaud, 1989) </ref> and Pushkar, Hall, and Acha-Daza (Pushkar et al., 1994) investigated this relationship and discovered many problems. They showed that the accuracy of (1) is a function of many factors including location and weather. <p> Note that the center of the fit window is simply the estimate of travel time based on the single-trap speed calculation. Although it is believed that this speed calculation is possibly inaccurate <ref> (Hall and Persaud, 1989) </ref>, for our purpose it is quite sufficient because it gives us a rough estimate of the true travel time.

Reference-contexts: The details of these different approaches are given in Sisiopiku and Rouphail (Sisiopiku and Rouphail, 1994b) and the references therein, and hence we do not review them here. Another approach is based on a real time simulation of the freeway, either microscopic (Sisiopiku and Rouphail, 1994a) or macroscopic <ref> (Sanwal et al., 1996) </ref>. The measurements from the existing loop detectors are used as input to the model and the link speed, and hence travel time, are taken as output.

Reference-contexts: An excellent overview of methods to determine travel time on arterial streets is given by Sisiopiku and Rouphail <ref> (Sisiopiku and Rouphail, 1994b) </ref>. One common technique involves using regression analysis to relate the flow and occupancy reported by single-trap loop detectors to the travel time on the link.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we develop methods for using these existing detectors to obtain accurate estimates of freeway travel times. We demonstrate our methods on data from I-880 <ref> (Skabardonis et al., 1994) </ref>. Our methods are based on a simple stochastic model in which vehicles that arrive at an upstream point during a given interval of time have a common probability distribution of travel times to a downstream point. <p> Petty, Bickel, Jiang, Ostland, Rice, Ritov and Schoenberg 7 4 Results In this section we present some results of the application of our methodology to data from a seven mile section of highway I-880 in Hayward, California <ref> (Skabardonis et al., 1994) </ref>. This section of freeway was instrumented with type 170 loop controllers spaced approximately 1/2 of a kilometer apart. Each loop controller monitored eight to ten mainline, double-trap loop detectors.
