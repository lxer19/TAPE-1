Abstract: We consider the problem of representing the denial of default information. We show that such denials are important parts of commonsense reasoning. Moreover, their representation is not a simple matter of negating traditional representations of default information. We have found a solution by separating default information into use and trend portions. This approach may also afford a more compact way to represent defaults in general.

Reference-contexts: To the contrary, it has been shown that experts are often influenced by irrelevant information and as a result their decisions may turn out to be incorrect or unreliable [13]. Moreover, experts are often unable to provide convincing accounts of how they make their judgments (see <ref> [1] </ref>). 4 follow more of a broad searching strategy, don't have well-formulated hypotheses early on, and obtain much more information (much of which is not of value). Feltovich et al [4] suggest several postulates regarding different characteristics of novice and expert knowledge bases (in the domain of medicine).

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly it is novice-expert differences that motivate many of these studies. Mayer <ref> [6] </ref> describes several knowledge-based distinctions between experts and novices including: (i) novices tend to store their knowledge in small fragmented units, while experts store theirs in larger interconnected functional units and (ii) experts tend to know and use deep structural knowledge while novices use more superficial knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Three well-known such formalisms are Reiter's default logic (DL) [12], McDermott and Doyle's non-monotonic logic (NML) [8], and McCarthy's circumscription <ref> [7] </ref>. Each of these offers a formal treatment of a reasoner coming to a reasonable yet defeasible conclusion, based on whatever knowledge is 3 available plus some default rule (s).

Reference-contexts: A reasoner need not go on to deny the individual defaults "typically cardinals are red" and "typically cardinals are russet" in reaching that conclusion. Why do range defaults deserve special mention? There are two reasons: (i) their representation presents a challenge (see <ref> [9] </ref>) and (ii) they can play a role in reasoning that is not accomplished solely with "ordinary" defaults. <p> circumscription, negating a default results in a counterexample axiom, which simply records that the default has led to an error in at least one case and is not an assertion that the default itself is a bad one that should not be used. (We analyze these issues in detail in <ref> [9] </ref>.) In short, default denial seems to create varied difficulties for standard formalisms. We will utilize the approach of [9] which appears to handle all of the problems simultaneously and uniformly across all the formalisms. <p> error in at least one case and is not an assertion that the default itself is a bad one that should not be used.

Reference-contexts: Very many cases of practical reasoning are of this sort. Yet this form of reasoning lies outside the framework of traditional "monotonic" logic in which more information leads to more (not fewer) conclusions <ref> [10] </ref>. Researchers have addressed this issue by developing formalisms for default (or nonmono-tonic) reasoning, in which something inferred from one set of information may fail to be inferred from that set augmented with additional information.

Reference-contexts: This is, in part, due to the expert's "fine-tuning" of her knowledge through clinical experience. These differences result in novice expectations (in the field of medical diagnosis) being "either overly general, allowing clinical findings that should not occur, or overly specific not allowing the legitimate range". Rau <ref> [11] </ref> provides a computational treatment of breadth and salience of knowledge which appears related to the appropriate range of application of knowledge in making judgments. Both experts and novices draw conclusions based on their knowledge. <p> zoo and the following conversation ensues: Tommy: "Look, someone's feeding all those birds!"

I thought cardinals were supposed to be bright red." Sue: "I used to think that also. Quite a few are red but many others are russet like these." Tommy: "Are all cardinals red or russet?"
