Abstract: A -automaton is a simple additive, binary cellular automaton on a graph. For product graphs such as a grids and cylinders, reversibility and periodicity properties of the corresponding -automaton can be expressed in terms of a binary version of Chebyshev polynomials. We will give a detailed analysis of the divisibility properties of these polynomials and apply our results to the study of -automata.

Since every basis vector except for 1 and m maps to an odd-cardinality pattern under S + m it follows that X [1] + X [k] = m + 1. Otherwise, the orbit of X under S + m would contain an odd-cardinality pattern.

The degree of t is m=2, and it follows by theorem 4.1 that the dimension of E is also m=2. Our claim follows. Let us write Z for the kernel of (P m;2p ).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A -automaton is a simple, non-uniform, binary cellular automaton on a directed graph. These automata were first studied by Lindenmayer in [7], and later in <ref> [1, 9, 12, 13, 2] </ref>. <p> The reversibility of the recurrence in the sense that n = x n+1 + n+2 will be important later. 3 In their recent paper <ref> [2] </ref>, Barua and Ramakrishnan show that m by n grids under rule + are reversible iff the two polynomials m+1 (x) and n+1 (1 + x) are coprime. <p> For the time being, though, we only consider polynomials over F 2 . We hasten to point out that the numbering of the polynomials differs from the one used in [12] and <ref> [2] </ref>; the polynomials there begin with 0 = 1 (i.e., in the old numbering i (x) = U i (x=2) mod 2). As it turns out, the current numbering makes it easier to state some of the divisibility properties. <p> In particular, G is reversible iff the map n+1 ( H ) is injective. The basic divisibility properties of binary Chebyshev polynomials are shared by a whole class of recurrences over F [x]. In fact, the following proposition holds in any Euclidean domain; see also <ref> [2] </ref> for a direct proof for -polynomials. 6 Proposition 2.1 Let a; b 2 F [x] be coprime, where F is an arbitrary finite field. <p> Using a geometric argument, it is shown in [12] that m+1 is an annihilator of S m . As pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref>, this fact follows immediately from the Caley-Hamilton theorem since m+1 is none other than the characteristic polynomial of S m . We will now show that m+1 is indeed the minimal polynomial of S m . <p> For the proof of minimality, it is convenient to use the following notation system for vectors in v 2 F m 2 . Let f1; 2; : : :; mg be the standard basis and write correspondingly for any non-zero vector v: v = v [1] + v <ref> [2] </ref> + : : : + v [k], where 1 v [1] &lt; v [2] &lt; : : : &lt; v [k] m.

We will refer to k as the length of v. Lemma 4.1 m+1 is the minimal polynomial of S m . Proof. <p> Lemma 4.1 m+1 is the minimal polynomial of S m . Proof. From the preceding discussion, it suffices to show that no polynomial of degree d &lt; m annihilates S m . To see this, note that S i m (1) = v [1] + v <ref> [2] </ref> + : : : + v [r] + (i + 1) for all 0 i &lt; m: S m is the sum of a right and a left shift with fixed boundary conditions. <p> But then, for any polynomial t of degree d &lt; m, we have t (S m )(1) = v [1] + v <ref> [2] </ref> + : : : + v [r] + d 6= 0, since the contribution of the leading term cannot be canceled by lower order terms. 2 The critical terms of m+1 are coprime by definition, hence we have the following fact. 12 Proposition 4.2 Let m + 1 = 2 <p> From linear algebra, we obtain a new basis v 0 1 ; : : : ; v 0 d such that v 0 i [1] = i, and d &lt; v 0 i <ref> [2] </ref> m or the length of v 0 i is only 1. Now suppose u is a kernel element not contained in the linear hull of v 0 1 ; : : : ; v 0 d . <p> Invariant subspaces will be used in the proof of theorem 5.2 below. 5 -Polynomials The last theorem gives a complete characterization of the coranks of a -automata on a grid. Indeed, the description of the corank of S n;m in <ref> [12, 2] </ref> can be rephrased as follows: d + (P n;m ) = deg n+1 (S m ) = deg gcd ( n+1 ; m+1 ) = deg gcd (n+1;m+1) = gcd (n + 1; m + 1) 1: In order to extend this result to + -automata, first note the <p> cork + n+1 (S m ) = deg gcd ( + n+1 ; m+1 ), by the last theorem, and we are done. 2 For a few special values of n and m one can determine d + (P m;n ) completely from theorem 5.1, see also theorem 4.6 of <ref> [2] </ref>. Corollary 5.1 For m + 1 = 2 k and n + 1 = 2 l p, p odd, we have d + (P n;m ) = &gt; &lt; 0 if 3 6 j n + 1, 2 k 1 otherwise. <p> To see this, note that f 2 = 0, whence ker f rg f = (ker f ) ? , where the last equality follows from the self-adjointness of f . It follows that E contains only symmetric patterns. For suppose X = X [1] + X <ref> [2] </ref> + : : : + X [k] is a pattern in E. k must be even, by orthogonality. Since every basis vector except for 1 and m maps to an odd-cardinality pattern under S + m it follows that X [1] + X [k] = m + 1. <p> It follows that the period of m must be larger than wper (m) and we have per (m) = 2 wper (m), as desired. 2 The analogue of the following corollary for weak periods was conjectured in [12] and first proved in <ref> [2] </ref>. Corollary 5.3 For all k 0: per + (2 k 1) = 3 2 k . 6 Cylinders In this section we will briefly show how to adapt our results for -automata on grids to -automata on cylinders of the form C m fi P n .

Reference-contexts: Consequently, there appears to be no easy way to compute the gcd of two polynomials m+1 (x) and n+1 (1 + x). The reader may also wish to compare these polynomials to another variation of binary Chebyshev polynomials discussed in <ref> [3] </ref> on page 118. The inductive definition there takes the form n = n1 + x n2 . Many of the divisibility properties of the -polynomials are shared by the - polynomials. <p> Background information from linear algebra and the theory of finite fields can be found in, say, [5], [10] or [6]. The second and third reference and Berlekamp's classic text on coding theory <ref> [3] </ref> both contain a careful discussion of the relationship between shift registers and finite fields. 2 Binary Chebyshev Polynomials Consider the sequence of -polynomials n , n 0, over F 2 [x] given by 0 = 0 and i (x) := U i1 (x=2) mod 2; where U n denotes the <p> Thus, (s i ) is a feedback shift register sequence or linear recurrent sequence, see <ref> [3] </ref> and [6] for a wealth of background information. We will frequently use results from these sources without further mention. Since the coefficient of s n in the recurrence is 1, the sequence must be periodic. <p> Lemma 3.2 The characteristic polynomial of recurrence (2) is irreducible over F q iff the linear term in t is 0. Proof. Let f be the characteristic polynomial as in equation (3). By the characteristic 2 version of Stickelberger's theorem, see <ref> [3] </ref>, f has two irreducible factors iff the trace of 1=ff is 0.

Since we can rule out the factor 2, the depth of an irreducible polynomial must actually be a divisor of q 1 or q + 1.

These automata were first studied by Lindenmayer in [7], and later in <ref> [1, 9, 12, 13, 2] </ref>. <p> Similar characterizations exist for cylinders C m fi P n and tori C m fi C n , see <ref> [12] </ref>. As we already mentioned, no similar simple characterization are known for the corresponding + -automata. In this paper we will focus on determining the reversibility of + -automata on product graphs of the form G = H fi P where P is a path or a cycle. <p> Let us write P n and C n for the undirected path and cycle of length n, respectively, and P m;n = P m fi P n for m by n grids. For product graphs G = H fi P n it is demonstrated in <ref> [12] </ref> that d (G) = cork n+1 ((H)); where i is a binary version of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. <p> In particular for -automata with H = P m we have per (P m ) = 2 (m + 1) = 4 2 wper (P m ). Barua and Ramakrishnan verify a conjecture from <ref> [12] </ref> which states that wper + (P 2 k 1 ) = 3 2 k1 for all k. We will show that per + (P 2 k 1 ) = 3 2 k . <p> For the time being, though, we only consider polynomials over F 2 .

It follows that the global map of G is injective iff the + (H) is injective; furthermore, the global map is always open. <p> More information on orthogonal subspaces in connection with -automata can be found in <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. Claim 1: F m 2 = E 1 E 2 where E 1 is the kernel of f = t (S + m ). Then E 1 consists precisely of all symmetric patterns in F m 2 and has dimension m=2. <p> It follows that the period of m must be larger than wper (m) and we have per (m) = 2 wper (m), as desired. 2 The analogue of the following corollary for weak periods was conjectured in <ref> [12] </ref> and first proved in [2].
