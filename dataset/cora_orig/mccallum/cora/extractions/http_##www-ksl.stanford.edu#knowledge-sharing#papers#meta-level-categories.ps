Title: An Ontology of MetaLevel Categories  
Author: Nicola Guarino, Massimiliano Carrara, and Pierdaniele Giaretta 
Date: January 16, 1994  
Note: LADSEB-CNR Int. Rep. 6/93 Substantially revised version  
Abstract: We focus in this paper on some metalevel ontological distinctions among unary predicates, like those between concepts and assertional properties. Three are the main contributions of this work, mostly based on a revisitation of philosophical (and linguistic) literature in the perspective of knowledge representation. The first is a formal notion of ontological commitment, based on a modal logic en dowed with mereological and topological primitives. The second is a formal account of Strawson's distinction between sortal and non-sortal predicates. Assertional properties like red belong to the latter category, while the former category is further refined by distinguishing substantial predicates (corresponding to types like person) from non-substantial predicates (corresponding to roles like student). The third technical contribution is definition of countability which exploits the topological notion of connection to capture the intended semantics of unary predicates.

Reference-contexts: If x has the property of being an apple, it cannot lose this property without losing its identity, while this does not seem to be the case in the latter example. This ob servation goes back to Aristotelian essentialism, and can be formalised as fol lows <ref> [1] </ref> : Def. 13 . A discriminating predicate P is ontologically rigid iff O |= " x (Px fi Px). An immediate theorem following from Definition 11 is the following: 12 Theorem 3. Any ontologically rigid predicate is also temporally stable.

Reference-contexts: We have shown how the ories defined at the (so - called) epistemological level, based on structured representa tion languages like KL-ONE, cannot be distinguished from their "flat" first-order logic equivalents unless we make clear their implicit onto logical as sumptions. Referring to the classi fication proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> , we have introduced therefore the notion of ontological level, intermediate between the epistemological and the conceptual levels. At the ontological level, formal distinctions are made among logical predi - cates, distin guishing between (meta-level) categories such as concepts, roles, and assertional properties. Such distinctions have three main purposes.

Reference-contexts: Within our modal framework, the first fundamental distinction we make among unary predicates regards their discriminating power. If we want to use a predicate for knowledge-structuring purposes it cannot be necessarily false for each element of the domain, i.e. it must be natural in the sense of <ref> [3] </ref> . Moreover, we are interested in predicates that tell us something nontrivial about the domain, excluding therefore those which are always necessarily true. Def. 9. Let L be a first order language, P a monadic predicate of L, and O an ontological commitment for L.

Reference-contexts: Studying the formal properties of such categories is a matter of formal ontology, recently defined by Cocchiarella as "the systematic, formal, axiomatic development of the logic of all forms and modes of being" <ref> [4] </ref> . 3. The formal framework Instead of trying to give a universal definition of the main predicate cate - gories, we shall pursue here a more modest goal: our definitions will be related to a specific first-order theory whose intended meaning we are interested in specifying.

Reference-contexts: We assume therefore that the intended models of our theory, rather than describing a real or hypothetical situation in a world that has the same laws of nature of ours <ref> [5] </ref> , are states of affairs having an idealised rational ac ceptability [18] .

Reference-contexts: This meaning is the result of a number of ontological commitments, which accumulate in layers from the very beginning of a knowledge base development process <ref> [6] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The notion of modality we are interested in accounts for rational possibility among such alternative states of affairs, i.e. among sets of mutually compatible worlds. We choose therefore the accessibility 1 This definition is taken from <ref> [7] </ref> , extended with a relation b intended to express the temporal precedence relationship between worlds. 6 relation r to coincide with the compatibility relation. Since the latter is an equivalence relation, our modal theory will be S5. Def. 4.

Reference-contexts: For a particular knowledge base, such ontological commitments are however implicit and strongly de pendent on the particular task being considered, since the formalism itself is in general delib erately neutral as concerns ontological choices: in their well-known textbook on AI, Genesereth and Nilsson ( <ref> [8] </ref>, p. 13) explicitly state the essential ontologi cal promiscuity of AI. We have argued elsewhere against this neutrality [12,14,13] , claiming that a rigorous ontological foundation for knowledge representation can result in better methodologies for conceptual design of data and knowledge bases, facili tating knowledge sharing and reuse.

Reference-contexts: Linguists such as Givn <ref> [9] </ref> have pointed out that temporal stability can be a useful criterion to distin guish verbs from nouns. We say that a predicate is temporally stable when, if it holds for an object at a given time, then it must hold for the same object at another time.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we introduce two metalevel properties which give a minimal characterization of individuality, and are therefore distinctive of sortal predicates. They bear on two main notions pro posed in the philosophical literature: countability <ref> [10] </ref> and temporal reidentifia bil ity [25] . The former is bound to the capac ity of a predicate to isolate a given object among others: " this is a P, this is another P, this is not a P. <p> Excluding those based on universal quantification on all parts of an object for reasons having to do with the problem of granularity, a quite satisfactory criterion is the one proposed by Griffin <ref> [10] </ref> , which can be formulated in such a way that P is a countable predicate iff " x.(Px $z.(z &lt; x Pz)). But such a criterion does not take into account a notion of topological connection which seems to be related to the notion of countability.

In this sense, a substack can be a stack only as an isolated whole. There are some intuitive and practical reasons in favour of this way of thinking.

Reference-contexts: these distinctions may impact the reasoning services offered by a KR formalism: for example, a terminological reasoner can forbid certain kinds of update on the basis of ontological considerations; it may take advantage of the fact that some kinds of concepts form a tree, while in general they do not <ref> [22] </ref> ; it may maintain indices for instances of concepts but not for instances of properties; it may provide domain-checking facilities for properties but not for concepts 2 .

Reference-contexts: According to Strawson, a sortal predicate (like apple ) supplies a principle for distinguishing and counting individual particulars which it collects, while a non - sortal predicate (like red ) supplies such a principle only for particulars already distinguished, or distinguishable, in accordance with some antecedent principle or method <ref> [23] </ref> . This distinction is (roughly) reflected in natural language by the fact that the former terms are common nouns, while the latter are adjectives and verbs. It is implicitly present in the KR literature, where sortal predicates are usually called concepts, while characterising predicates are called properties.
