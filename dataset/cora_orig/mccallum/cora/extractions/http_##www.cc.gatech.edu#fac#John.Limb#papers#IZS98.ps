Abstract: A reservation-based MAC protocol has been adopted by standards bodies as the basic protocol for data communication within the upstream channel of a cable plant. The available capacity is divided in two separate channels. One is a random access channel, or contention channel, used to send requests to the head-end, with the possibility of collisions occurring therein. When collisions happen, they are resolved by using a Contention Resolution Algorithm (CRA). The second channel is a data channel to send user information in a collision-free manner. Adaptive algorithms are used to divide the system capacity dynamically, between the data and contention channels depending on the system requirements. In this paper the performance and implementation issues of p-persistence and tree-based CRAs under this adaptive environment are compared. While the complexity of the p-persistent algorithm remains as simple as in a traditional Aloha channel traditional implementations of the tree-based algorithms becomes more complex. Simple and efficient implementations of the tree-based algorithms are proposed. It is shown that the performance difference between the studied algorithms is very small.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The topological abstraction of a cable TV plant is a folded unidirectional-bus (Fig. 1). The upstream bus (or channel) carries the information from the stations to the head-end while the downstream channel supports the communication from the head-end to the stations. A centralized reservation protocol has been proposed <ref> [1, 2] </ref> as the basic MAC protocol to arbitrate the communication in the upstream channel. The upstream channel is divided into small transmission units called mini-slots (MSs). A station, upon receiving a message to transmit, sends a request to the head-end by using a mini-slot (MS).

Interleaving is then said to occur and each CRA duplicate is referred to as an interleave <ref> [5] </ref>. The number of interleaves used is equal to the number of CMSs in a round-trip. Therefore, consecutive mini-slots assigned to an interleave are one RTD apart, emulating a system with an RTD smaller than the transmission time.

Reference-contexts: In general the exact number of contending users is not known and an estimator to adapt p is required. We use the pseudo-Bayesian estimator proposed by Rivest <ref> [6] </ref>. In this adaptive-p implementation, unlike conventional Aloha, new arrivals also apply the probability p before transmitting and thus are not distinguished from old contenders. 2.2 Tree Algorithm In a tree algorithm, all users involved in a collision are divided in n sub-groups. <p> One, referred to as "ideal" (curve i), corresponds to an ideal implementation that adjusts p according to the exact number of contending users. This implementation bounds the performance for a real implementation of p-persistence using an estimator. The second implementation (curve e) uses the estimator proposed by Rivest in <ref> [6] </ref> to adapt the p value (implemented as in [7]). Curves f and b give the results for the tree scheme with free-access and blocked-access respectively both operating with a single interleave in breadth-priority order (as described in Section 3.2 and [11]).

Reference-contexts: This minimum number varies in time and depends on the traffic characteristics and the usage of piggybacking. Unreserved mini-slots are assigned for contention to further reduce the probability of collision and to avoid wasting any capacity <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper we study the performance and implementation issues of traditional contention resolution algorithms when they operate in a variable slot structure, or equivalently, in a contention channel with variable capacity. <p> On the other hand, breadth-first order gives a more random order of resolution. The maximum stable throughput, blocked , with ternary splitting is 40.16%. 3 Reservation-based MAC Protocol In the reservation protocol CMSs are variably intermixed with data transmissions <ref> [7] </ref>. If the CRA operates efficiently on all the CMSs the efficiency of the contention channel of the reservation scheme should approach closely the bound of the random access channel. The p-persistent algorithm is not affected by the data transmissions. <p> the slots could be used for contention resolution; since the results of prior collisions are not available they cannot be used in this way. 3.2 Continuous-mode Structure It has been shown that the overall MAC performance is driven more by the slot structure than by the efficiency of the CRA <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. Therefore, we would like a CRA that operates efficiently, independently of the slot structure. Fig. 4 (b) shows an efficient slot structure where CMSs are intermixed with data slots as frequently as possible, maintaining a desirable ratio between data and contention bandwidth [7]. <p> Therefore, we would like a CRA that operates efficiently, independently of the slot structure.

For the blocked-access tree the maximum delay variation is smaller when breadth-priority order is used. 4 Performance Comparison Our simulation procedure adhered closely to the procedure outlined in [10] and used in <ref> [7] </ref>. A data packet (or cell) requires 4 MSs to be transmitted (one MS for PHY, MAC and protocol headers and 3 MSs for the 48-cell payload).

A centralized implementation yields identical results to the distributed implementation. In both cases the p estimator lags behind the exact value by one RTD <ref> [7] </ref>. mance difference between the CRAs. other CRAs. Perfect synchronization of the stations in the tree scheme is very important. In a distributed tree implementation, errors produce inconsistency of the global state of the affected stations. Resynchroniza-tion of the state can take time to recover.

Reference-contexts: Curves f and b give the results for the tree scheme with free-access and blocked-access respectively both operating with a single interleave in breadth-priority order (as described in Section 3.2 and <ref> [11] </ref>). Access delay is defined as the time from the arrival of a message to the time that the last mini-slot of the message is transmitted. Utilization is defined as the percentage of channel capacity carrying payload (the headers are not considered to be payload).

Reference-contexts: and hence of preserving 5 In our measures, jitter is defined as the standard deviation of the delay distribution. 6 If at the time of the second collision (Fig. 5) a new interleave is generated, it is possible to distinguish the old contention and assign CMSs to this interleave first <ref> [12] </ref>. CMSs are controled by the same tree as an additional branch of the current level of the tree. at least partial-order. A breadth-priority order assigns CMSs to the two collision trees in parallel serving one level of each collision tree at a time (similar to using two interleaves). <p> Note that with separate interleaves the two collisions are also served in parallel. Thus this single interleave implementation gives similar jitter performance to a multiple interleaving mechanism but in a more efficient manner. It is possible to design an interleaving mechanism that strictly preserves order and maintains efficiency <ref> [12] </ref> but this mechanism is significantly more complex. With a single interleave implementation a breadth-priority order should be used when the maximum delay variation value is most important. In summary, with the new tree implementations presented in this section interleaving is not required to maintain throughput or delay performance.

Reference-contexts: In a centralized implementation the synchronization problem does not exist because there is only one copy (at the head-end) of the global state. But then the head-end needs to give specific instructions to the stations as to which stations can transmit in each CMS. This can be done <ref> [13] </ref> by marking the CMSs with a code. This code is continuously broadcast on the downstream channel (together with the slot specification) so that stations can identify the CMSs. When a collision occurs, the head-end sends to the station the identifier of the CMS where the station has to retransmit. <p> For example, it allows one some control of the multiplicity of collision 7 . On the other hand, the tree algorithm requires an additional control mechanism, such as p-persistence in the first-transmission rule <ref> [13, 14] </ref>, to achieve the same flexibility. 7 In cable systems it is very important to control the number of users simultaneously transmitting in the same CMS (referred to as multiplicity of collision) because laser clipping can occur and destroy transmissions on other frequency channels.
