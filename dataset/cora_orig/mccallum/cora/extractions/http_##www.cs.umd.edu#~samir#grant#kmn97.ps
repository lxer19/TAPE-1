Title: The Budgeted Maximum Coverage Problem  best possible, unless N P DT IM E(n log log n

Abstract: The budgeted maximum coverage problem is: given a collection S of sets with associated costs defined over a domain of weighted elements, and a budget L, find a subset of S 0 S such that the total cost of sets in S 0 does not exceed L, and the total weight of elements covered by S 0 is maximized. This problem is NP-hard. For the special case of this problem, where each set has unit cost, a (1 1 e )-approximation is known. Yet, no approximation results are known for the general cost version. The contribution of this paper is a (1 1 for the budgeted maximum coverage problem. We also argue that this approximation factor is e )-approximation algorithm

Reference-contexts: We show that in this case, the set cover problem could be approximated within an approximation factor better than ln n, where n is the number of elements. By the following result of Feige <ref> [F96] </ref> this implies that N P DT IM E (n loglog n ). Theorem 5: If the set cover problem is approximable within a factor of (1 *) ln n for any * &gt; 0 then N P DT IM E (n loglog n ). <p> On the other hand, it was shown by Feige <ref> [F96] </ref> that the set cover problem is not approximable within a factor (1 *) ln n for any * &gt; 0 unless N P DT IM E (n loglog n ).

Reference-contexts: We note that this was also independently observed by Feige <ref> [F97] </ref>. We use an argument similar to that in [GK98] for proving a hardness result for a facility location problem. Suppose that there exists an approximation algorithm, denoted by A, guaranteeing approximation within a factor ff &gt; (1 1 e ) for the unit cost maximum coverage problem.

Reference-contexts: Many applications arising in circuit layout, job scheduling, facility location, and other areas, may be modeled using the maximum coverage problem (see <ref> [H97] </ref> and the references therein for examples of applications). The budgeted maximum coverage problem introduces a more flexible model for the applications mentioned above. Consider, for example, the problem of locating k identical facilities so that the market share is maximized, introduced in [MZH83]. <p> The greedy heuristic for the special case of the maximum coverage problem picks at each step a set maximizing the weight of the uncovered elements. Hochbaum and Pathria [HP94] (see also Hochbaum <ref> [H97] </ref>) presented an elegant analysis of the greedy heuristic. As we show in the sequel, the greedy heuristic cannot be trivially generalized to achieve a good approximation for the budgeted version of the problem. <p> Finally, let j i be the index of the iteration in which set S i was considered, i = 1; : : :; l + 1. The following two lemmas generalize the lemmas for the unit cost version of the problem, presented in [HP94] (see also <ref> [H97] </ref>). 3 Lemma 1: After each iteration j i , i = 1; : : : ; l + 1, the following holds: w (G i ) w (G i1 ) L Proof: Clearly, w (OP T ) w (G i1 ) is no more than the weight of the elements

Reference-contexts: The budgeted maximum coverage problem introduces a more flexible model for the applications mentioned above. Consider, for example, the problem of locating k identical facilities so that the market share is maximized, introduced in <ref> [MZH83] </ref>. Namely, there exist clients with associated profits, situated in known locations. A client will use a facility if the facility is within the specified distance from the client. The goal is to locate k facilities so that the total profit of the clients served by the facilities, is maximized. <p> For example, each candidate site for constructing a facility is associated with some cost, and one is assigned a limited budget for constructing the facilities. This generalization of the problem of locating facilities to maximize market share is also discussed in <ref> [MZH83] </ref>. The budgeted maximum coverage problem is a model that allows us to handle this type of applications. Unfortunately, even the unit cost version of the maximum coverage problem is NP-hard, by a straightforward reduction from the set cover problem.

Reference-contexts: They have shown, in particular, that the greedy heuristic achieves an approximation factor of 1 (1 1 k ) k &gt; (1 1 maximizing nondecreasing submodular functions satisfying f (;) = 0, where k is the maximum cardinality of sets in the optimization domain. Vohra and Hall <ref> [VH93] </ref> noted that the unit cost maximum coverage problem belongs to this class of problems. The greedy heuristic for the special case of the maximum coverage problem picks at each step a set maximizing the weight of the uncovered elements.
