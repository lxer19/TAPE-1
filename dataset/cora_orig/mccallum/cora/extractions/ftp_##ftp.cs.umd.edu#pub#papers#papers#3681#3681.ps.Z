Abstract: In this paper we present our implementation of a system of active logic that processes natural language discourses. We focus on problems that involve presupposition and the associated well-known problems of the projection of presupposition. We discuss Heim's largely successful theory of presupposition and point out certain limitations. We then use these observations to build our discourse processor based on active logic. Our main contributions are the handling of problems that go beyond the scope of Heim's theory, especially discourses the involve cancellation of presupposition. Ongoing work suggests that conversational implicature and the cancellation of implicature can also be treated by our methods.

Reference-contexts: We think that there is much to be gained from a more fine-grained approach, modeling the underlying step-by-step reasoning a listener may perform during the unfolding of an ongoing conversation. Active logic <ref> [ 13, 1 ] </ref> seems to us to be a potentially powerful tool for modeling such behavior, allowing contradictory beliefs to trigger reasoned belief revision. In this paper we will examine a well-known theory of context updating proposed by Heim [ 5 ] . <p> The reason we discussed the subtle problem with the non garden path D 6 first was to suggest that there may be no such easy fix for all cases. 3 Active Logic Compared to Nonmonotonic Logic Active logic <ref> [ 13, 1 ] </ref> is a family of formalisms developed for the purpose of modeling the reasoning process in a way that respects the passage of time as reasoning proceeds.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Discourses that involve presupposition present important challenges for research into the computational treatment of the interplay between discourse context and the flow of utterances that comprise a discourse. Traditional studies of presupposition <ref> [ 2, 7, 15 ] </ref> have focused on characterizing the "right" final context resulting from a discourse while paying less attention to a realistic model of the intermediate processes involved in achieving the final context (or final interpretation of what was said). <p> They also develop an ontology based on Meinong's theory of objects. They use this ontology to deal with discourses about fictional entities and discourses that involve presupposition. We believe, along with others <ref> [ 2, 5, 6, 14, 8 ] </ref> that presupposition can be treated separately from fictional discourse and that we can achieve this without a Meinongian ontology. The ultimate success of our approach would bear out this claim. McRoy [ 11, 10 ] presents an abductive treatment of misunderstanding in dialogs.

Reference-contexts: The other facts (ut, parse, etc.) are however still available. They inherit through all steps but we have only shown them where they play a role in reasoning from one step to the next. 5 Conversational Implicature We believe that presupposition and conversational implicature <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> , illustrated by the two examples below, are distinct discourse phenomena. This is a point we will develop on another occasion. However, both phenomena are nonmonotonic in that both can be either blocked or cancelled as a discourse progresses.

Reference-contexts: The Maxim of Quantity: Always convey as much and no more than is required for the purposes of the conver-sation. The Maxim of Relevance: Always make your contribution relevant to the purposes of the conversation. In our implementation which we discuss in more detail in <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> , we have not represented any of the Gricean maxims explicitly. We regard them as specifications for building a discourse participant. Each of our discourse rules articulates one or more of the maxims.

Reference-contexts: Active logic [ 13, 1 ] seems to us to be a potentially powerful tool for modeling such behavior, allowing contradictory beliefs to trigger reasoned belief revision. In this paper we will examine a well-known theory of context updating proposed by Heim <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . This theory is largely successful in accounting for much of the complexity of processing discourses that involve presupposition. We will point to some problems with theory. <p> Apparently, certain syntactic forms (such as definite descriptions, possessives, and factive verbs) give rise to potential presuppositions which may or may not produce a presupposition in the total discourse. 1 One of the best theories designed to account for this complexity was proposed by Heim <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> in the form of three rules for incrementally updating discourse context. These rules account for all of the presupposition facts right in the above examples. We will discuss Heim's rules in the section 2. <p> This type of accommodation is known in the theory as global accommodation. However this would yield a contradiction in the final updated context. As a way out, Heim suggests using what she calls local accommodation <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . <p> They also develop an ontology based on Meinong's theory of objects. They use this ontology to deal with discourses about fictional entities and discourses that involve presupposition. We believe, along with others <ref> [ 2, 5, 6, 14, 8 ] </ref> that presupposition can be treated separately from fictional discourse and that we can achieve this without a Meinongian ontology. The ultimate success of our approach would bear out this claim. McRoy [ 11, 10 ] presents an abductive treatment of misunderstanding in dialogs.

Reference-contexts: These three examples are superficially similar to those above. However they present problems for a computational theory of presupposition and context that have not been widely discussed (but see the section 6 where we mention <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> ). 1 For our purposes here we will only work with examples where presupposition is caused by the use of a definite description. <p> Ours is an approach appealing to nonmonotonic reasoning. Other nonmonotonic approaches to presupposition include those of Mercer [ 12 ] and Marcu and Hirst <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> . Mercer employs a system of default rules to model the presuppositions arising from syntactic forms that appear in utterances. In [ 12 ] he deals with adverbial implicatures such as the following. If John kicked the ball, then Bill kicked the ball too. <p> A major difference between Mercer's approach and ours is that he does not address the time evolving positing and cancellation of presupposition. This is a constant theme in the comparison of our approach with others. Marcu and Hirst <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> present a system designed to handle cancellation of presuppositions. But they take an approach quite different from our approach. They do not model the step by step incremental reasoning about context. Rather they compute an entire new theory after each utterance.

However, in our approach, belief revision is handled as part-and-parcel of the inference process; it does not require an additional module or phase of processing. Moreover, contrary to <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> , we do not need to assume there are no "abnormalities"; or rather any abnormality is easily retracted later in the dialog when new evidence is heard.

As shown in our output traces in section 4 and in Miller <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> , active logic engines are often able to reason quite effectively with contradictions.

Reference-contexts: The story of the reason why goes like this: The person attempting to understand this discourse can easily just assume that c 1 should have entailed that John has a son. When a hearer makes such an assumption he is "accommodating" the speaker <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> . In this case the hearer accommodates to transform c 1 into c 1 0 = c 1 " [[John has a son]], thus making the updating defined after all.
