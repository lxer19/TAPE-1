Abstract: We develop and analyze a superlinearly convergent affine-scaling interior-point Newton method for infinite-dimensional problems with pointwise bounds in L p -space. The problem formulation is motivated by optimal control problems with L p -controls and pointwise control constraints. The finite-dimensional convergence theory by Coleman and Li (SIAM J. Optim., 6 (1996), pp. 418-445) makes essential use of the equivalence of norms and the exact identifiability of the active constraints close to an optimizer with strict complementarity. Since these features are not available in our infinite-dimensional framework, algorithmic changes are necessary to ensure fast local convergence. The main building block is a Newton-like iteration for an affine-scaling formulation of the KKT-condition. We demonstrate in an example that a stepsize rule to obtain an interior iterate may require very small stepsizes even arbitrarily close to a nondegenerate solution. Using a pointwise projection instead we prove superlinear convergence under a weak strict complementarity condition and convergence with Q-rate &gt;1 under a slightly stronger condition if a smoothing step is available. We discuss how the algorithm can be embedded in the class of globally convergent trust-region interior-point methods recently developed by M. Heinkenschloss and the authors. Numerical results for the control of a heating process confirm our theoretical findings. 1. Introduction. We introduce an affine-scaling interior-point Newton method

Reference-contexts: Problem (P) is a special type of cone constrained optimization problems in Banach space. For this very general class of problems Alt <ref> [2] </ref> developed a Lagrange-Newton-SQP method and proved quadratic convergence. A drawback of SQP-type methods consists in the fact that in each step a linearly cone-constrained quadratic problem or, equivalently, a linear generalized equation has to be solved.

Reference-contexts: During the last fifteen years several attempts have been undertaken to develop algorithms for which each iteration is not much more expensive than an ordinary Newton step. One of these is the projected Newton method which was introduced by Bertsekas <ref> [3] </ref> for finite-dimensional bound-constrained problems. Kelley and Sachs [15] extended this method to problems of type (P) with special structure and proved local convergence with Q-rate 1 + fi, 0 &lt; fi &lt; 1. <p> The class of problems addressed in [15] is essentially the same as the one discussed in x8 of this work. Although it is possible in the finite-dimensional case to prove quadratic convergence, see <ref> [3] </ref>, Kelley and Sachs could not establish this result in their infinite-dimensional setting. In this paper we develop local convergence results for infinite-dimensional affine-scaling interior-point Newton methods which are similar to those by Kelley and Sachs [15] for projected AFFINE-SCALING INTERIOR-POINT NEWTON METHODS 3 Newton methods.

Reference-contexts: The back-transport. Since the solution u n k+1 of the affine-scaling Newton equation in step 2.3 is not necessarily an interior point of B, a back-transport into B ffi is needed. In [7] a stepsize rule is used for this purpose. A reflection technique was proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> and [6]. We will see that in our function space setting very small stepsizes k may be necessary to achieve u s k + k (u n k ) 2 B ffi . Thus, a stepsize rule fails to provide superlinear convergence, cf. Example 6.3.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm presented in this paper is based on the application of a Newton-like iteration to an affine-scaling formulation of the first-order necessary optimality conditions. For finite-dimensional problems this class of algorithms has been introduced and analyzed by Coleman and Li <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]. Extensions to problems with additional equality constraints were studied in Dennis, Heinkenschloss, Vicente [8], Heinkenschloss, Vicente [13], and Vicente [25], [26]. In all of the above papers except for [26] the affine-scaling Newton iteration is embedded in a trust-region interior-point algorithm to achieve global convergence. <p> Hence, for increasingly accurate discretizations the domain of quadratic convergence will shrink whereas the domain of superlinear convergence will be stable. It is important to note that our convergence results require modifications of the finite-dimensional algorithm investigated in <ref> [6] </ref> and [7], especially the enforcement of strict feasibility by a modified projection instead of a stepsize rule. This argumentation shows that the development of efficient algorithms for the solution of infinite-dimensional optimization problems also leads to improved finite-dimensional methods. <p> The back-transport. Since the solution u n k+1 of the affine-scaling Newton equation in step 2.3 is not necessarily an interior point of B, a back-transport into B ffi is needed. In [7] a stepsize rule is used for this purpose. A reflection technique was proposed in [4] and <ref> [6] </ref>. We will see that in our function space setting very small stepsizes k may be necessary to achieve u s k + k (u n k ) 2 B ffi . Thus, a stepsize rule fails to provide superlinear convergence, cf. Example 6.3. <p> Remark 6.2. In the finite-dimensional case one can easily show by using a componentwise version of (37) that k = 1O (ku k+1 u k k) if second-order sufficiency conditions with strict complementarity hold at u. See <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]. The following example illustrates that the above scenario can really occur. Moreover, we will see that the use of a stepsize rule may lead to almost a stagnation of the iteration whereas the proposed projection technique yields fast convergence. Example 6.3. <p> ULBRICH AND S. ULBRICH Conclusions. We have developed an affine-scaling interior-point Newton algorithm for bound-constrained minimization subject to pointwise bounds in L p -space. The method is an extension of the algorithms by Coleman and Li <ref> [6] </ref>, [7] for finite-dimensional problems. Our infinite-dimensional framework raised a couple of difficulties which are not present in the finite-dimensional case. A careful analysis led to several modifications of the original algorithm which enabled us to prove superlinear convergence for the resulting method.

Reference-contexts: For this problem class a smoothing step can be derived from a fixed point formulation of the KKT-conditions. Moreover, we show that the second-order sufficiency condition of Dunn and Tian <ref> [9] </ref> implies our regularity assumption on G.

In x9 we discuss the relationship between sufficient second-order conditions developed in <ref> [9] </ref> and the regularity assumptions we impose on the approximate derivative operator G. x10 addresses the question how our algorithm can be used to accelerate the globally convergent class of trust-region interior-point algorithms recently proposed in [24]. <p> Lemma 8.3) and in important cases by a sufficient second-order condition of Dunn and Tian <ref> [9] </ref> (see Theorem 9.4). <p> Remark 8.4. The results of Lemma 8.3 remain true if ff also depends on u. 9. Second-order sufficient conditions. We will now study how Algorithm 5.17 behaves in the neighborhood of a point u satisfying the second-order sufficient condition given by Dunn and Tian in <ref> [9] </ref>. We will show that it implies (A3) in the case q = 2 under the additional assumptions of the previous section and also for q &gt; 2 if the range of ~ H (u) is dense in L q . <p> In x10 we will use this sufficiency condition to show that the developed affine-scaling Newton method produces acceptable steps for the trust-region globalization considered in [24] if the iterates u k are close enough to u. In our notation, the formal second-order sufficiency conditions by Dunn and Tian <ref> [9] </ref> read Assumption (Second-order sufficient conditions by Dunn and Tian). (OS) Condition (A1) holds and there are t 2 [1; 1], c r &gt; 0 such that jhv; r 2 f (u)wij c r kvk 2 kwk 2 8 u 2 B; v; w 2 L 1 (51) u2B kuuk t <p> L 1 -optimality. The following Theorem shows that (OS) implies the L 1 - optimality of u for (P) (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). Theorem 9.2. Let the formal second-order sufficiency condition (OS) hold. Then u is a strict L 1 -optimizer for (P), more precisely: there are &gt; 0 and C &gt; 0 such that u 2 B; ku uk 1 &lt; =) f (u) f (u) Cku uk 2 32 M. <p> ULBRICH AND S. ULBRICH Proof. The proof is a variant of the one given for Lemma 1 in <ref> [9] </ref>. Let u 2 B. <p> We have the following variant of Theorem 4 in <ref> [9] </ref>: Theorem 9.3. Let the formal second-order sufficiency condition (OS) with t &lt; 1 (i.e. also for t = 2) and (A5) hold. <p> We have discussed how smoothing steps can be obtained for a class of regularized problems. Moreover, we have shown that our theory is applicable under the assumptions used by Kelley and Sachs [15] as well as those by Dunn and Tian <ref> [9] </ref>. We have demonstrated that our algorithm can be used as accelerator for the class of globally convergent trust-region interior-point methods introduced in [24]. The good performance of this algorithm is documented by our numerical results for the boundary control of a heating process. Acknowledgments.

Reference-contexts: In all of the above papers except for [26] the affine-scaling Newton iteration is embedded in a trust-region interior-point algorithm to achieve global convergence. In a recent paper (Ulbrich, Ulbrich, Heinkenschloss <ref> [24] </ref>) we extended the finite-dimensional global convergence theory of Coleman and Li [7] for trust-region interior-point algorithms to the infinite-dimensional problem class (P). <p> Moreover, we show that the second-order sufficiency condition of Dunn and Tian [9] implies our regularity assumption on G. Finally, we discuss how our algorithm can be embedded in the globally convergent class of trust-region interior-point methods recently introduced in <ref> [24] </ref>. The resulting method is applied to the boundary control of a heating process which was already considered in [5], [18]. This paper is organized as follows. In x2 we introduce some notation and put together several important estimates for L p -spaces. <p> In x9 we discuss the relationship between sufficient second-order conditions developed in [9] and the regularity assumptions we impose on the approximate derivative operator G. x10 addresses the question how our algorithm can be used to accelerate the globally convergent class of trust-region interior-point algorithms recently proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>. Finally, we present numerical results for the boundary control of a heating process in x11. 2. Preliminaries. 2.1. Notation. We write B c = n B for the complement of a measurable set B and denote the characteristic function of B by B , i.e. <p> Given 1 q 1 q 2 1 and 0 1, let 1 q 0 1 satisfy 1=q 0 = =q 1 + (1 )=q 2 . Then for all v 2 L q 2 : kvk q 0 kvk q 1 kvk q 2 (1) Proof. See <ref> [24, Lem. 5.2] </ref>. Lemma 2.3. Let q 0 2 [1; 1] and q 1 ; q 0 1 2 [1; 1] with 1=q 1 + 1=q 0 1 = 1 be given. <p> ULBRICH AND S. ULBRICH 2.3. Necessary optimality conditions. The method is based on an affine-scaling formulation of the first-order necessary optimality conditions. A detailed derivation of these conditions can be found in <ref> [24] </ref>. Therein we also prove second-order necessary conditions which are not needed in our context. Theorem 2.5 (First-order necessary optimality conditions, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions). Let u be a local minimizer of problem (P) and assume that f is differentiable at u. <p> Then (O1) u 2 B, 8 &gt; : = 0 for x 2 with a (x) &lt; u (x) &lt; b (x); 0 for x 2 with u (x) = a (x); 0 for x 2 with u (x) = b (x) a.e. on , are satisfied. Proof. See <ref> [24, Thm. 3.1] </ref>. <p> For details we refer to <ref> [24] </ref>. The idea was first introduced by Coleman and Li in [7] for the finite-dimensional case. Lemma 2.6. Let f : D L p ! IR be differentiable and u 2 B. <p> In the case p = 1 assume in addition that the gradient satisfies g (u) 2 L 1 , u 2 B. Then (O2) is equivalent to d (u)g (u) = 0 (3) for all d satisfying (2). Proof. See <ref> [24, Lem. 3.2] </ref>. 3. A Newton-like step. As for all efficient methods, we aim to apply Newton's method to a suitable formulation of the optimality system. In our approach we take equation (3) which, according to Lemma 2.6, is equivalent to the first-order necessary condition (O2). <p> We recall that the only requirements on d 0 needed for the global convergence analysis in <ref> [24] </ref> are the conditions d 0 (u)g (u) 0 and kd 0 (u)k 1 c d 0 for all u 2 B. <p> (16) For all x from case (16) as well as all x with d (u)(x) = min fjg (u)(x)j; c (x)g d (u)(x) we get jd (u) d (u)j jmin fu a; b u; cg min fu a; b u; cgj ju uj; where we have used the inequality (cf. <ref> [24, Lem. 9.3] </ref>) j min fa 1 ; : : : ; a n g min fb 1 ; : : : ; b n g j max fja 1 b 1 j; : : :; ja n b n jg : For all x with d (u)(x) = min fjg <p> This function is used as quadratic model in the interior-point trust-region methods recently analyzed in <ref> [24] </ref>. Since [u s k ] is strictly convex in our context, it attains its global minimum at u n k+1 . We start both iterations with u 0 = u " , " = 0:5, and ~ = 0:999995. <p> In x10 we will use this sufficiency condition to show that the developed affine-scaling Newton method produces acceptable steps for the trust-region globalization considered in <ref> [24] </ref> if the iterates u k are close enough to u. <p> AFFINE-SCALING INTERIOR-POINT NEWTON METHODS 35 10. Trust region globalization. The aim of this section is to show that near a local optimizer satisfying (OS) Algorithm 5.17 produces admissible trial steps for the globally convergent affine-scaling interior-point trust-region algorithm that we proposed and analyzed in <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> There is no danger of ambiguity. As shown in <ref> [24] </ref>, a globally convergent algorithm can be obtained as follows: Denote by u k 2 B ffi the current iterate. <p> For our presentation it is convenient to use an update rule for the trust-region radius k that is slightly different from the one given in <ref> [24] </ref>. However, it is not hard to verify that all the convergence results stated therein remain valid. <p> fl 2 k ] if 2 &lt; r k &lt; 3 ; [fl 2 k ; fl 3 k ] else: ; k+1 := + if r k 1 ; maxf min ; + g else: For a detailed formulation of the algorithm and its convergence properties we refer to <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> The theory developed therein (adapted to our update rule) states that under assumption (A1) each accumulation point of the sequence (u k ) satisfies the first-order necessary optimality conditions (O1),(O2), and, moreover, the second-order necessary condition <ref> [24, Thm. 3.3, (O3)] </ref> if (D) is replaced by a fraction of optimal decrease condition. Having in mind that trust-region methods for unconstrained problems inherit their local convergence behavior from Newton's method, it is natural to try to accelerate the 36 M. ULBRICH AND S. <p> Thus, we may expect that a BFGS- or PSB-approximation of the Hessian in the discrete model performs nearly independent of the discretization, cf. [14] for the mesh-independence of BFGS. For the numerical tests Algorithm 5.17 was embedded in the trust-region framework of <ref> [24] </ref> as described in Algorithm 10.1. <p> Moreover, we have shown that our theory is applicable under the assumptions used by Kelley and Sachs [15] as well as those by Dunn and Tian [9]. We have demonstrated that our algorithm can be used as accelerator for the class of globally convergent trust-region interior-point methods introduced in <ref> [24] </ref>. The good performance of this algorithm is documented by our numerical results for the boundary control of a heating process. Acknowledgments.
