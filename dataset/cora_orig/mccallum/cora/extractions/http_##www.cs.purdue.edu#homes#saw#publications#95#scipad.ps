Abstract: The National Information Infrastructure (NII) that will evolve in the 1990's and beyond will impact many institutions of life. These include the way we learn and do science, self-caring, access to civil/information infrastructure systems & services, and management & control of manufacturing processes. The future scenario for the NII assumes wireless networks used by walkstations realizing the dream of truly ubiquitous access to the information superhighway. Some of the current obstacles in building such a ubiquitous access system on mobile high-performance platforms include the user interface for these walkstations, the ability of sniffing information across heterogeneous geographically distributed information systems, the ability of processing sensoring data for monitoring and control, and the dynamic reconfigura-bility of computations between the mobile unit and the stationary servers. Our effort in the area of ubiquitous computing involves the design and implementation of intelligent models and techniques to address the aforementioned obstacles. In this paper we present the architecture of an intelligent electronic notepad, called SciencePad, to support a scientist in the research environment of the future. fl This work was supported in part by NSF grants CDA-9123592 and ASC 9404859.

Reference-contexts: SciencePad is itself built using these agents and the services provided by the lower layers. The highest-layer represents specializations of SciencePad to domain-specific instantiations. For example, a SciencePad for nonlinear chromatography systems used for component separation in chemical engineering <ref> [1] </ref>. We expect that the hardware platform supporting SciencePad will not be able to execute most scientific computing applications. Hence, any such application is logically viewed as having two parts, a proxy and a scion.

Reference-contexts: SciencePad is equipped with a browser for such information. This will incorporate the ability to search the web for information pertaining to given parameters. To take into account the heterogeneous nature of the databases, we exploit InterBase, a technology being developed at Purdue <ref> [2] </ref>. These are the basic functionalities that we feel will allow a scientist sufficient power to do his work. The hardware to support these facilities is available today. What is missing is the software that provides users with integrated platforms to apply these facilities effectively.

Reference-contexts: The lowest layer comprises the data and knowledge communication infrastructure for SciencePad. This layer contains a generic communication facility based on the software bus model and various knowledge communication facilities. SciencePad supports the ARPA Knowledge and Query Manipulation Language <ref> [3] </ref> and SciencePad Knowledge Interchange Format (SKIF), a SciencePad-specific knowledge communication format based on PDESpec [6]. The next level is the software infrastructure supporting user interfaces building and component cooperation. Software components are viewed as agents and this layer provides the infrastructure for building the agents needed for SciencePad.

Reference-contexts: The wireless link is a 2Mbps AirLan Ethernet on top of which we run TCP/IP. The domain of the intelligent information management system is chosen as partial differential equations (PDEs). The core application in the scion is //ELLPACK <ref> [4] </ref>, a system to solve elliptic PDEs. SciencePad can be logically viewed as consisting of three subsystems, the notebook interface, the applications and supporting agents, and the means of communication between them. In the presents instance, the user interacts with SciencePad using the notebook.

Reference-contexts: This means that once their training phase is over, their classification is virtually instantaneous. 13 Some preliminary work done in this connection has produced very encouraging results. Specifically, backpropagation based networks have been used to identify the class to which a novel problem belongs <ref> [5] </ref>. Results from this experiment have been very encouraging, with both the learning and generalization abilities of the network clearly coming through.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 illustrates an impression of a predicted scenario for the NII. 2 This new paradigm, variously referred to as mobile, nomadic or ubiquitous computing, raises a host of research issues in a variety of areas of computer science <ref> [7] </ref>. The nature of the hardware involved in the mobile part of this scenario forces certain restrictions, like limited amounts of communication bandwidth, memory, and power. Another critical issue is the nature of the interfaces, the traditional WIMP (Window, Icon, Mouse, Pointer) type are unlikely to be successful. <p> This pen and paper kind of model of human computer interaction involves the design of completely new interface mechanisms <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. Such interfaces will of necessity be multimodal, as well as be endowed with innate intelligence. In order to serve as an effective tool, we expect SciencePad to provide certain basic functionality.
