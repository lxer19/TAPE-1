Abstract: Recently, Bell and Sejnowski have presented an approach to blind source separation based on the information maximization principle. We extend this approach into more general cases where the sources may have been delayed with respect to each other. We present a network architecture capable of coping with such sources, and we derive the adaptation equations for the delays and the weights in the network by maximizing the information transferred through the network. Examples using wideband sources such as speech are presented to illustrate the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Thus the output becomes u (t) = W x (t) = P Ds (t). The sources will be separated but they may be permuted and scaled. Learning W by observing the x only requires making use of higher order statistics (HOS) <ref> [6, 5, 1] </ref>.

Combined with a nonlinear squashing function normally seen in neural network contexts this criterion seems to provide a theoretical framework for approaches of the first category above. <p> of the algorithm. 2 INFORMATION MAXIMIZATION Bell and Sejnowski proposed to learn W by minimizing the mutual information between components of y (t) = g (u (t)), where g is a nonlinear function approx imating the cumulative density function (cdf) of the sources (see Fig. 1 for a two-source network) <ref> [1] </ref>. and Sejnowski in the case of two mixtures of two sources. <p> Bell and Sejnowski demonstrated the efficiency of this rule in the separation of as many as ten artificially mixed audio sources. 3 SHORTCOMINGS OF CURRENT ALGORITHMS As pointed out in [15] and <ref> [1] </ref>, there are several obstacles to applying these algorithms to real world situations. These include the effect of noise to the learning of the separating solution, possibly unknown number of sources (especially noise sources), and the assumption that the source signals are stationary. <p> Some of the literature addresses partly the delay and multipath problems using various different methods [14, 8, 19, 13, 11]. No general and rigorous solution exists so far. Bell and Sejnowski <ref> [1] </ref> also suggested a learning rule for just a single weight with a delay, but they did not present a general solution to the separation of delayed sources. However, Bell's approach of using information-theoretic principles in the derivation of the adaptation rules is very appealing. <p> becomes the following from eq. 5 (similarly for w 2 ): w 1 _ (1 2y 1 )x 1 + 1=w 1 ; Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech & Signal Processing, May 7-10 1996, Atlanta, GA, USA The bias adaptation will be the same as in <ref> [1] </ref>, namely w 0i _ 1 2y i . The role of these weights and biases is to scale and to shift the data so as to maximize the information passed through the sigmoid g. <p> 2 (t d 12 )); 2 = 2 @y 2 @u 2 = (1 2y 2 )y 0 @D = @d 12 where we have taken advantage of the fact that @u 2 (td 12 ) dt (u 2 (t d 12 )) = _u 2 (t d 12 ) <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We demonstrated that both the weights and the delays in the network can be learned by the information maximization principle first presented by Bell and Sejnowski for the case of instantaneous mixtures <ref> [1] </ref>. While mere adaptive delays may suffice in some applications, for real audio signals they are not enough. The acoustic environment (like a room) imposes a different impulse response between each source and microphone pair.

Reference-contexts: This kind of situations can be modeled as convolved mixtures.

This brings the technology one step closer to real world applications, though many items remain to be investigated, such as the effect of independent noise to the adaptation, and how to handle an unknown number of sources (especially noise sources).
