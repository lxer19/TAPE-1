Reference-contexts: It states that any AC 0 predicate is computed with high probability by a family of circuits of quasi-polynomial size (i.e., size 2 (log n) O (1) ) which consist of a parity gate connected to AND gates which are small (i.e., have polylog fan-in). Allender and Hertrampf <ref> [AlHe 90] </ref> subsequently applied the Valiant-Vazirani technique to obtain a uniform version of Allender's result. Yao [Yao 90] then used these techniques to obtain the first non-trivial upper bound for ACC. <p> The resulting circuit is a MidBit + circuit. 2 The following main theorem uses a combination of the above results, techniques of Valiant and Vazirani [ValVaz 86], Toda [Tod 91], Allender and Hertrampf <ref> [AlHe 90] </ref>, and the lowness methods of Section 4. It says that circuits consisting of a MidBit gate over ACC subcircuits can be simulated by MidBit + circuits. The proof is similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2 in [BeTa 91]. <p> The AND and OR gates in each c i can be replaced by probabilistic Mod + m circuits with polylog-many random bits, using the techniques of [ValVaz 86] as applied by <ref> [AlHe 90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Sections 5 and 6 together present our main application, which is an improvement on previous simulations of the circuit class ACC (originally defined by Barrington <ref> [Ba 89] </ref>). Some background and explanation of how our work builds on prior techniques is in order. It is by now well known that relationships among Turing machine classes, both with and without relativization, correspond closely to circuit simulations or circuit-class separations.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, in Section 5 we show that for all k 2, all languages in Mod k P (see <ref> [CaHe 89b, He 90, BeGi 92] </ref>) are low for MP. Sections 5 and 6 together present our main application, which is an improvement on previous simulations of the circuit class ACC (originally defined by Barrington [Ba 89]). <p> Then there exists a #P function f 0 with bounding polynomial p 0 such that upon taking g 0 (x) = g (x; p 0 (jxj)) as bit-selection function, L 2 MP via f 0 and g 0 . Proof. (a) The statement for P is immediate from <ref> [BeGi 92] </ref>. The statement for PP follows quickly from the result P PP [O (log n)] = PP in [BeReSp 91]: Let c be a constant such that jf (x)j g (x) c log 2 (jxj) for all x 2 fl . <p> Since k is prime, we can adapt results from Toda [Tod 91] and Beigel and Gill <ref> [BeGi 92] </ref> to obtain a function f A 2 #P such that for all x and m, f A (x; 0 m ) A (x) (mod k m ): Now let f (x; 0 m ) = f A (x; 0 r (x;0 m ) )2 m . <p> Proof. First suppose k is prime. Then Mod k P is closed under p T <ref> [BeGi 92] </ref>. Hence by Theorems 4.6 and 5.1, Mod k P is low for MP and for AmpMP. Now suppose k is composite; 14 then one can write k = p e k 0 where p is prime, e 1, and gcd (p; k 0 ) = 1. <p> Also denote any function g of x 1 ; :::; x n as g (x). We have that each Mod + k circuit c i outputs 1 if and only if a certain sum i of AND-gates is nonzero mod k. (From an observation of Beigel and Gill <ref> [BeGi 92] </ref>, without loss of generality i is always 0 or 1 (mod k), by Fermat's little theorem.) Note that we can think of each i as a polynomial in fx 1 ; :::; x n g of polylog degree.

Reference-contexts: By combining the Valiant-Vazirani method with improved versions of Toda's "amplifying polynomials," he showed that every language in ACC is recognized by a family of depth-2 probabilistic circuits of quasipolynomial size with a symmetric gate at the root and small AND gates at the leaves. Then Beigel and Tarui <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref> simplified Yao's proof and strengthened the result in two respects: (1) the circuits given by Yao can be made deterministic without increasing their size, and (2) the simulation applies not only to ACC circuits, but also to circuits consisting of one symmetric gate (at the root) connected to ACC <p> This is the circuit analogue of the result that PH and all the Mod k P classes are low for P #P [1] , and shows that this lowness relationship holds relative to all oracles. In the results of both [Yao 90] and <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref>, the symmetric gate at the root depends on the number of inputs and the types of modular gates used in the ACC circuit. It seems 2 very hard to work directly with depth-2 circuits of the type given in [Yao 90] or [BeTa 91] in proving lower bounds, since <p> results of both [Yao 90] and <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref>, the symmetric gate at the root depends on the number of inputs and the types of modular gates used in the ACC circuit. It seems 2 very hard to work directly with depth-2 circuits of the type given in [Yao 90] or [BeTa 91] in proving lower bounds, since all that can be said about the gates at the root is that they belong to an infinite subfamily of the symmetric functions. <p> Furthermore, as follows from our lowness results, even a circuit consisting of a Midbit of ACC circuits can be simulated by MidBit + circuits. Much of the above can be proved by applying the ideas and techniques of <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref>. Our main technical contribution regarding the ACC problem is a means of converting representations involving counting modulo some prime p into "Midbit" representations in binary notation. <p> Yao [Yao 90] conjectured that there are languages in TC 0 which cannot be computed by probabilistic circuits consisting of a symmetric gate over small AND's, and Beigel and Tarui <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref> make a similar, nominally weaker conjecture for deterministic circuits of this kind. Likewise, we believe that there are TC 0 languages that cannot be computed by MidBit + circuits. <p> We make use of polynomials of a type first constructed by Toda [Tod 91] and successively improved by <ref> [Yao 90, BeTa 91] </ref>. <p> The modulus-amplifying polynomials Q d have the property that for every k 1 and X 0, X 0 (mod k) ) Q d (X) 0 (mod k d ); (The modulus-amplifying polynomials constructed by Beigel and Tarui <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref> have degree 2d 1.) Now it follows that b n (x) = i=1 Q d ( i ) mod k d : We choose d = p 0 (log n) where p 0 is a polynomial such that k p 0 &gt; 2 r+t+2 . <p> Then fC n g is computable by a family of MidBit + -circuits. Proof. Beigel and Tarui <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref> have shown that a Mod m gate can be simulated by a "stratified" circuit of Mod k 1 ; Mod k 2 ; :::; Mod k l gates where k 1 ; k 2 ; :::; k l are the prime divisors of m, on levels 1; 2; :::; <p> They also showed that a polylog-size AND of Mod k gates (for k prime) can be switched with the Mod k 's to produce a Mod + k circuit. Using these facts, Corollary 6.4 and an inductive argument as in the proof of Lemma 6 in <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref>, each layer of Mod k i gates can be "absorbed" in the MidBit gate, and the resulting polylog fan-in AND gates "pushed" down to the leaves. <p> It says that circuits consisting of a MidBit gate over ACC subcircuits can be simulated by MidBit + circuits. The proof is similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2 in <ref> [BeTa 91] </ref>. Theorem 6.6 Let fC n g be a family of depth-d circuits of size 2 polylog (n) consisting of a MidBit gate at the root and Mod m , AND, OR, and NOT gates at remaining levels.

Reference-contexts: It follows that if MP = AmpMP, or even if C = P AmpMP, then the entire counting hierarchy [Wa 86] collapses to MP. We had hoped to be able to show lowness without any extra closure conditions on C. However, very recently Kobler and Toda <ref> [KoTo 93] </ref> showed that if the class AmpMP defined in this paper is low for MP, then the counting hierarchy likewise collapses. We return to this question and give other open problems about MP in our concluding Section 7. <p> The interest in whether these results can be improved was heightened by recent work of one of the present authors and Toda <ref> [KoTo 93] </ref>. They define a language L to belong to the class ModP if there are functions f 2 #P and g 2 FP such that for all x, g (x) = 0 p where p is prime, and x 2 L () f (x) 6= 0 (mod p). <p> Hence if either AmpMP or ModP is low for MP, then the counting hierarchy collapses to MP. This is fairly strong evidence that AmpMP itself is not low for MP, and that Theorem 4.6 cannot be improved much further. However, intuitively speaking, the proof in <ref> [KoTo 93] </ref> that a given language L in ModP belongs to AmpMP first amplifies on the left of the bit L (x) ("Claim 1" in [KoTo 93]), and then on the right ("Claim 2"). <p> However, intuitively speaking, the proof in <ref> [KoTo 93] </ref> that a given language L in ModP belongs to AmpMP first amplifies on the left of the bit L (x) ("Claim 1" in [KoTo 93]), and then on the right ("Claim 2"). We considered the stronger amplification property (6) in early work on this paper, but rejected it because the simpler Definition 4.1 expedited our main results. <p> We leave as our final open problem the question of whether the stronger amplification property does capture lowness for MP, or to the contrary, whether the arguments of <ref> [KoTo 93] </ref> can be applied to this case as well. This last problem may seem very arcane, but the results of [KoTo 93] show that a slight 20 technical distinction can make a large difference in the power of a class, and we suspect that at least some of the keys <p> We leave as our final open problem the question of whether the stronger amplification property does capture lowness for MP, or to the contrary, whether the arguments of <ref> [KoTo 93] </ref> can be applied to this case as well.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The celebrated results of Toda <ref> [Tod 91] </ref> have sparked renewed interest in the complexity classes #P [Va 79], PP (probabilistic polynomial time [Gi 77]), and P (parity polynomial time [PaZa 83, GoPa 86]). <p> . (c) MP is closed downward under p m , and is closed under complements and join. (d) MP = P MP [1] . (e) MP is closed under intersection if and only if MP = S Proof. (a) The inclusion PP P MP follows from inspection of Toda's proof <ref> [Tod 91] </ref> that PP P P #P , as discussed in Section 1. <p> L 2 P, Toda's amplifying polynomials yield a #P function f such that for all x and m, if x 2 L then f (x; 0 m ) 0 (mod 2 m ), and if x =2 L, then f (x; 0 m ) 1 (mod 2 m ) (see <ref> [Tod 91] </ref>). <p> We can quickly show the same lowness property for the class BPP P shown in <ref> [Tod 91] </ref> to contain the polynomial hierarchy (PH). Proposition 4.7 BPP P and PH are low for MP and for AmpMP. Proof. Proposition 4.2 relativizes to show that for any oracle set A, BPP A AmpMP A . Hence BPP P AmpMP P . <p> Since BPP P is closed downward under p T , it too is low for AmpMP. Lowness for MP is similar, and the conclusions for PH follow since PH BPP P . 2 By careful examination of the proof in <ref> [Tod 91] </ref>, we find that the lowness of BPP P for MP is a consequence of the more general result that any #P BPP P function reduces to the "middle bits" of some #P function (see [ToWa 92] for related results about #P PH ). <p> Proof. Let A be a set in Mod k P and let r be the FP function r (x; 0 m ) = 2m + 2, so that k r (x;0 m ) 2 2m+2 . Since k is prime, we can adapt results from Toda <ref> [Tod 91] </ref> and Beigel and Gill [BeGi 92] to obtain a function f A 2 #P such that for all x and m, f A (x; 0 m ) A (x) (mod k m ): Now let f (x; 0 m ) = f A (x; 0 r (x;0 m ) <p> We make use of polynomials of a type first constructed by Toda <ref> [Tod 91] </ref> and successively improved by [Yao 90, BeTa 91]. <p> The resulting circuit is a MidBit + circuit. 2 The following main theorem uses a combination of the above results, techniques of Valiant and Vazirani [ValVaz 86], Toda <ref> [Tod 91] </ref>, Allender and Hertrampf [AlHe 90], and the lowness methods of Section 4. It says that circuits consisting of a MidBit gate over ACC subcircuits can be simulated by MidBit + circuits. The proof is similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2 in [BeTa 91]. <p> The output of the desired MidBit + circuit is the bit in position blog 2 (s)=2c+t (log n) of S 0 . 2 7 Conclusion and Open Problems The class MP is important not only for its role as the implicit upper bound in Toda's proofs <ref> [Tod 91] </ref>, but also for its place at the frontier of counting classes whose relationships are not well understood.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Assume that C = P AmpMP. Since the class C = P is closed under disjunctive and conjunctive reductions ([Tor 88, GuNaWe 90, Gr 93, BeChOg 93]) it follows from Theorem 4.6 that C = P would be low for MP. However, from the result of <ref> [Tor 88] </ref> that PP PP = PP C = P , this would give PP PP MP C = P = MP, implying that the entire counting hierarchy collapses to MP. 2 5 Lowness of Mod Classes for the Class MP In this section we show that for any k, Mod

Reference-contexts: It is by now well known that relationships among Turing machine classes, both with and without relativization, correspond closely to circuit simulations or circuit-class separations. Toda proved his first theorem, PHBP P, using techniques introduced by Valiant and Vazirani <ref> [ValVaz 86] </ref>. The circuit analogue of this result was proved by Al-lender [Al 89], using polynomial methods introduced by Razborov [Raz 87] and Smolensky [Smo 87]. <p> The resulting circuit is a MidBit + circuit. 2 The following main theorem uses a combination of the above results, techniques of Valiant and Vazirani <ref> [ValVaz 86] </ref>, Toda [Tod 91], Allender and Hertrampf [AlHe 90], and the lowness methods of Section 4. It says that circuits consisting of a MidBit gate over ACC subcircuits can be simulated by MidBit + circuits. The proof is similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2 in [BeTa 91]. <p> The AND and OR gates in each c i can be replaced by probabilistic Mod + m circuits with polylog-many random bits, using the techniques of <ref> [ValVaz 86] </ref> as applied by [AlHe 90].

Reference-contexts: It follows that if MP = AmpMP, or even if C = P AmpMP, then the entire counting hierarchy <ref> [Wa 86] </ref> collapses to MP. We had hoped to be able to show lowness without any extra closure conditions on C. However, very recently Kobler and Toda [KoTo 93] showed that if the class AmpMP defined in this paper is low for MP, then the counting hierarchy likewise collapses.

Reference-contexts: Allender and Hertrampf [AlHe 90] subsequently applied the Valiant-Vazirani technique to obtain a uniform version of Allender's result. Yao <ref> [Yao 90] </ref> then used these techniques to obtain the first non-trivial upper bound for ACC. <p> This is the circuit analogue of the result that PH and all the Mod k P classes are low for P #P [1] , and shows that this lowness relationship holds relative to all oracles. In the results of both <ref> [Yao 90] </ref> and [BeTa 91], the symmetric gate at the root depends on the number of inputs and the types of modular gates used in the ACC circuit.

It seems 2 very hard to work directly with depth-2 circuits of the type given in [Yao 90] or [BeTa 91] in proving lower bounds, since all that can be said about the gates at the root is that they belong to an infinite subfamily of the symmetric functions. <p> By choosing an appropriate Toda polynomial, the bit can be "isolated" from the rest of the string, and this leads to our Theorem 5.2, and in circuit form, Theorem 6.3. Yao <ref> [Yao 90] </ref> conjectured that there are languages in TC 0 which cannot be computed by probabilistic circuits consisting of a symmetric gate over small AND's, and Beigel and Tarui [BeTa 91] make a similar, nominally weaker conjecture for deterministic circuits of this kind. <p> We make use of polynomials of a type first constructed by Toda [Tod 91] and successively improved by <ref> [Yao 90, BeTa 91] </ref>. <p> We can multiply the sum by repeated addition so that this is precisely the middle bit. 2 We now turn our attention to MidBit gates at the root and pure ACC subcircuits <ref> [Yao 90] </ref>. A family fC n g of circuits belongs to pure-ACC if there is a fixed m such that for all n, every gate in C n is a Mod m gate.
