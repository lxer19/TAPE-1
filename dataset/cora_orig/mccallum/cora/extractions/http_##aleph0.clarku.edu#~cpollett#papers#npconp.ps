Abstract: We introduce multifunction algebras B t i where t is a set of 0 or 1-ary terms used to bound recursion lengths. We show that if for all ` 2 t we have ` 2 O(jxj) then B t i = F P p i1 (wit; _t), those multifunctions computable in polynomial time with at most O(p(`(x))) queries to a p i1 witness oracle for ` 2 t and p a polynomial. We use our algebras to obtain independence results in bounded arithmetic. In particular, we show 2 does not prove the polynomial hierarchy collapses. We then consider a subtheory, Z, of the well-studied bounded 2 . Using our algebras (mainly the i = 1 variants of our algebras) we establish the following properties of this theory: (1) Z cannot prove the polynomial hierarchy collapses. In fact, even Z+ ^ b arithmetic theory S 2 = [ i S i

Reference-contexts: It is therefore not unreasonable to conjecture that if there are quasipolynomial sized circuit (or even p-time) secure pseudorandom generators (which is a strong form of P 6= N P ) and P = BP P (which is true with respect to a random oracle <ref> [1] </ref>) then in fact S 1 2 ` P 6= N P . So independence proofs for S 1 2 may be hard to prove. Nevertheless, proving a better independence result for this fragment or weaker ones is important.

Reference-contexts: So independence proofs for S 1 2 may be hard to prove. Nevertheless, proving a better independence result for this fragment or weaker ones is important. Not only would it rule out some methods of proving P 6= N P , but given the recent work on automatizability <ref> [2] </ref> such a result could lead to efficient theorem proving methods for these systems. This would impact both the declarative language community and people who study theorem proving for computer aided verification.

Reference-contexts: This hierarchy corresponds in a natural way to the polynomial time hierarchy: In the standard model b i -formulas describe exactly predicates in p i . Similarly, b i -formulas correspond to p i -predicates. This correspondence is proven in Buss <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Then we characterize their ^ b i -multifunctions. We begin with BASIC which consists of all substitution instances finite set of quantifier free axioms for the non-logical symbols of L 2 . These axioms are listed in Buss <ref> [3] </ref> with the exception of the axioms for M SP and : which are listed in Takeuti [19]. <p> It is not known if R i 2 . However, ^ R i 2 R i 2 since one can show R 0 2 proves the axioms of EBASIC [13]. Finally, it follows by the recursive doubling trick used to show S i+1 2 in Buss <ref> [3] </ref> that Z i+1 Z i for each i. Proofs in our theories will be carried out in the sequent calculus system LKB of Buss [3], together with the theories' axioms as initial sequents. <p> Finally, it follows by the recursive doubling trick used to show S i+1 2 in Buss <ref> [3] </ref> that Z i+1 Z i for each i. Proofs in our theories will be carried out in the sequent calculus system LKB of Buss [3], together with the theories' axioms as initial sequents. <p> Buss <ref> [3] </ref> shows that one gets the same theory if one formulates S i 2 or T i 2 with inductions axioms or induction rules. The same proof works in the ^ T i;t 2 case. <p> The witness predicate above is simplified from Buss <ref> [3] </ref>. The simplification arises because we are in the prenex setting. <p> So we can choose f to be the zero function. The weak inferences, structural inferences, and cut can be handled in essentially the same way as in the S i 2 case of the witnessing argument in Buss <ref> [3] </ref>. The remaining cases are the bounded quantifier rules and induction. <p> In which case, F P B Z 1 since the ^ b 1 -definable functions of S 1 2 are F P (from Buss <ref> [3] </ref> and using the fact that S 1 2 can prove every b 1 -formula equivalent to a ^ b 1 -formula) and S 1 2 S 2 . This is a contradiction since B Z 1 does not contain b x 3 c.

Reference-contexts: Also, S 2 2 (ff) might still be able to prove no circuit family of size n m can decide SAT for each integer m, which would still imply P 6= N P . In fact, Buss <ref> [4] </ref> shows the b 1 -formula which says that C does not code a jxj m - size circuit which computes satisfying assignments to any satisfiable instance x of SAT can be witnessed by a probabilistic p-time algorithm with error bounded away from a half.

Reference-contexts: We define ^ T i;t EBASIC+ ^ b i IN D t We define S 2 := [ i S i 2 and define Z := [ i Z i where Z i := ^ T i;fjidj i+3 g 2 . It is shown in Pollett <ref> [13] </ref> that T i 2 = ^ T i 2 = ^ S i 2 . It is not known if R i 2 . However, ^ R i 2 R i 2 since one can show R 0 2 proves the axioms of EBASIC [13]. <p> It is shown in Pollett <ref> [13] </ref> that T i 2 = ^ T i 2 = ^ S i 2 . It is not known if R i 2 . However, ^ R i 2 R i 2 since one can show R 0 2 proves the axioms of EBASIC [13]. Finally, it follows by the recursive doubling trick used to show S i+1 2 in Buss [3] that Z i+1 Z i for each i. <p> Remark 18 Let A and B be formulas. We recall some useful tautologies (i) (8y t)(A (a) ^ B (y)) , A (a) ^ (8y t)B (y) (iii) (8y t)(A (a) _ B (y)) , A (a) _ (8y t)B (y) Remark 19 The following was shown in Pollett <ref> [13] </ref>. The proof is a straightforward induction argument. <p> For the other direction the proof is the same as Theorem 20 once one observes that (W y t (x))(y = y) can be ^ b 1 -defined in ^ T 1;t 2 using (9z t (x))(z = y). 2 18 The next two theorems are from Pollett <ref> [13] </ref>. We will have need of them in the next section. Theorem 25 (i 1) Suppose for all ` 2 t that ` 2 O ( _ fjxjg). Let 2 _t be the set of terms 2 ` where ` 2 _t . <p> Then ^ T i;2 _t 2 B ( ^ b i+1 ) 2 . The ^ b i+1 -predicates of both these classes are P p i1 ( _t ). Theorem 26 (i 0; k 2) [Pollett <ref> [13] </ref>, Corollary 57] The ^ b i+k -predicates of ^ T 2 are P p We went to some effort establishing Corollary 24 since Pollett [13] does not classify the ^ b 1 -definable multifunctions of ^ T 1;t 2 which we will have need of in the next section. <p> The ^ b i+1 -predicates of both these classes are P p i1 ( _t ). Theorem 26 (i 0; k 2) [Pollett <ref> [13] </ref>, Corollary 57] The ^ b i+k -predicates of ^ T 2 are P p We went to some effort establishing Corollary 24 since Pollett [13] does not classify the ^ b 1 -definable multifunctions of ^ T 1;t 2 which we will have need of in the next section. <p> So suppose S i 2 + Z proves a sequent of ^ b i+1 -formulas ! . (We can reduce B ( ^ b i+1 )-conservativety to this case using the same proof as Theorem 59 in Pollett <ref> [13] </ref>.) Since Z m Z m+1 for all m, we can assume in fact that S i 2 + Z m proves A for some fixed m &gt; 0. Hence, also S i 2 + ^ T 2 proves ! . <p> This multifunction is ^ b i+1 -definable in S i 2 and using ^ b i IN D fjidjg on how this multifunction is defined in <ref> [13] </ref>, S i 2 can prove it has the desired properties. So S i 2 + ^ T 2 can simulate the S i 2 + ^ T 2 proof of ! .
