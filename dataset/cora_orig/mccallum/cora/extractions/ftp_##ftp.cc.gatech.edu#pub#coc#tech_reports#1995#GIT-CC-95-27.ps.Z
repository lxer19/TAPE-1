Abstract: Data traffic sequences from two campus FDDI rings, an Ethernet, two entry/exit points of the NSFNET, and sub-sequences belonging to popular TCP port numbers on one of the FDDI rings indicate that appropriately differenced time-series generated from these traces can be modeled as Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average (ARMA) processes. The variates of the ARMA filter are, however, non-Gaussian.

Reference-contexts: There appears to be a period of length approximately 8 time units, corresponding to 0:8sec. This is confirmed with a cumulative periodogram plot (see <ref> [1, pp 321-324] </ref>): P j n 2 ; Second 15 minutes. where n is the sample size, and I (f i ) is the amplitude at frequency f i = i=n: I (f i ) = n t=1 2 n X Y t sin 2f i t : For a process <p> The autoregres-sive moving average (ARMA) series models were popularized by Box and Jenkins <ref> [1] </ref> for purposes of modeling time series data. <p> The objective was to ensure that W t = Y t Y ts had only a small number of significant auto-correlations. (b) Based on the ACF and the partial autocorrelation function of W t ; identifying a set of ARMA (p; q) model forms. See <ref> [1, Ch. 6] </ref>. (c) Obtaining parameter estimates for the alternatives selected by minimizing (3). (d) Checking the ACF of fa t g for each alternative to ensure that it is white noise (i.e., uncorrelated). <p> See Figure 7 for some examples. If fa t g were uncorrelated and Gaussian with sample size n; the estimated auto-correlation at lag k; denoted r k ; may be assumed to have a standard error of n 1=2 for larger lags, see <ref> [1, Ch. 8] </ref>), and if the model is appropriate, Q = n k=1 2 is approximately 2 (K p q) distributed for K sufficiently large. If, however, the model is inappropriate, Q is inflated. <p> in any standard text book on time series analysis and is given by W t (r) = i=1 where i 2 R; (i = 1; 2; ); and are the weights given to W t+ri ; (i = 1; 2; ): For their relationship with the ARMA model parameters, see <ref> [1, Ch. 5] </ref>. Another way of writing the forecast function is in terms of the both the past p + P s values of W t and the past q + Qs noise terms as follows.

Reference-contexts: Since the datasets are four or more orders of magnitude longer than the missing values, the results of the two methods can be expected to be similar. To analyze the traffic data, we used the subroutine G13AFF of the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) subroutine <ref> [9] </ref>, which uses the forecasting approach. These 10 subroutines can be interfaced with Fortran or C programs to estimate the parameters of ARIMA models.

Reference-contexts: However, it also dampens the dependence in the data across far lags [see Eq. (8) ]. It is interesting to note that the noise suppression problem is similar to that in numerical integration of partial differential equations <ref> [13] </ref>. Finite-difference schemes for different classes of partial differential equations have been developed with the explicit objective of damping noise in their solution paths.
