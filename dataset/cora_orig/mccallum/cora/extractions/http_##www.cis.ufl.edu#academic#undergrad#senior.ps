Abstract: In this class, you will synthesize much of what you have learned in your other CIS courses by creating and finishing a semester-long project. This is an opportunity for you to put into practice the skills and techniques that you have learned during your undergraduate studies. The course will give you experience designing and building a significant software system or module. You will have the responsibility of meeting deadlines and, sometimes, dealing with incomplete problem specifications. This kind of experience is one familiar to CIS majors who have worked in industry and government after having received their baccalaureate degrees. Your deliverables for the course include: There are two key people that come into play for the course: the project advisor and the CIS 4905 course supervisor. The course supervisor will monitor your progress throughout the semester, while you will work directly with your project advisor to achieve final project completion. The project advisor is usually a faculty member, although in some cases, the person can be a professional from outside the faculty. The advisor should be thought of as your "client." The CIS 4905 supervisor will handle the administrative end of the course and will be responsible for assigning a grade based on your written and oral reports, although your final grade will be determined as a result of input from both your advisor and supervisor. You should maintain regular contact with your advisor. Often, e-mail is the best vehicle for this interaction; however, you and your advisor should investigate the best means for communication.
