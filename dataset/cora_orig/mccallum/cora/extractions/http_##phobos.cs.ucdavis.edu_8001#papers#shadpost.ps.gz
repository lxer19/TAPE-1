Reference-contexts: The GA and feedback is then used to guide future tutoring interactions. Architecture and Local Genetic Learning Implemented as the prototype system "Shadow," the system is based upon the filtered newsreader FRN <ref> (Mock & Vemuri, 1994) </ref> and the education system GAITS (Quafafou, 1994). In GAITS, we consider supervised teaching techniques where the teacher assigns a pedagogical objective to each student before teaching begins. In order to achieve this objective, the tutor interacts with the learner using predefined dialogues.
