Title: On the Random Walk Method for Protocol Testing  
Author: Milena Mihail Christos H. Papadimitriou

Abstract: An important method for testing large and complex protocols repeatedly generates and tests a part of the reachable state space by following a random walk; the main advantage of this method is that it has minimal memory requirements. We use the coupling technique from Markov chain theory to show that short trajectories of the random walk sample accurately the reachable state space of a nontrivial family of protocols, namely, the symmetric dyadic flip-flops. This is the first evidence that the random walk method is amenable to rigorous treatment. Following West's original reasoning, efficient sampling of the reachable state space by random walk suffices to ensure effectiveness of testing. Is, however, efficient sampling of the random walk necessary for the effectiveness of the random walk method? In the context of Markov chain theory, "small cover time" can be thought of as a simpler justification for the effectiveness of testing by random walk; all symmetric (reversible) protocols possess the small cover time property. Thus the conclusions of our work are that (i)the random walk method can be understood in the context of known Markov chain theory, and (ii)symmetry (reversibility) is a general protocol style that supports testing by random simulation.

Reference-contexts: rapid mixing arguments for the justification of the random walk method extend beyond SDFF's? Secondly, are rapid mixing conditions necessary for the random walk testing method to be effective? For the first question, there are counter-examples showing that, if any of the conditions defining SDFF's fails, rapid mixing also fails <ref> [7] </ref>. But perhaps characterizations somewhat different to the features of SDFF's may reveal further rapid mixing cases (experiments suggest that "random" symmetric protocols mix rapidly, thus, capturing features of randomness that ensure rapid mixing might be a way to proceed). <p> We impose the additional technical condition that there are no self-loops, that is actions that leave the state of some involved automaton unchanged (self loops are treated in <ref> [7] </ref>). <p> In Figures 3 and 4 we outline examples where if any of the above conditions fail, rapid mixing fails (more extensive discussions are in <ref> [7] </ref>; the counter-like counter-examples were pointed out to us by Ernie Cohen). Thus, in the strict sense, rapid mixing cannot extend beyond SDFF's, unless we obtain some characterization somewhat different to the features involved in SDFF's. <p> Thus, in the strict sense, rapid mixing cannot extend beyond SDFF's, unless we obtain some characterization somewhat different to the features involved in SDFF's. On the positive side, experiments with random graphs indicate that random symmetric protocols mix rapidly <ref> [7] </ref>. Therefore, perhaps there are features of randomness that can be captured to establish rapid mixing beyond SDFF's (in graph theory, the process of isolating features of random graphs, and constructing explicit graphs that posses these features thus inheriting certain behaviors of random graphs, is well explored).
