Title: Analysis of full-sibship configurations in a maternal  
Author: half-sibship. Ian Painter 
Date: June 2nd, 1994  
Abstract: The determination of population structure in a plant population is a major objective of population biology. Here the analysis of possible full sibship configurations in a maternal half sibship of Chamaelirium Luteum using the genotype of the sibship and the mother, but with unknown fathers is investigated. The use of the maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the true configuration is investigated, as is the use of Bayesian methods to calculate a posterior distribution on set of possible configurations. These methods were used to analyse a set of 8 seedlings, using genotypes at 8 loci available for the seedlings and the mother, and accurate population allele frequencies, though the emphasis is on developing methods for analysis of this situation in general, rather than analysis of specific data. Both methods of analysis were found to be feasible for small numbers of seedlings ( 14), though further work needs to be done to decide how to specify good prior distributions to make the Bayesian method practical. For more than 14 seedlings, analysis using the maximum likelihood estimate is no longer practical. Calculation of the posterior distribution on the possible configurations is still possible, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to simulate (dependent) realizations from the posterior distribution. This was found to be practical for up to 20 seedlings, and possibly higher depending on the amount of data and the true configuration. For large numbers of seedlings, the calculation of other posterior probabilities such as the chance that two seedlings have the same father is still possible, and these may provide a useful summary of the posterior distribution. Documentation on a set of programs developed for analyses of possible configurations is included. fl This work is supported by National Science Foundation Grant BIR-9305835.

Reference-contexts: Using MCMC methods to evaluate the posterior For more than 14 seedlings, complete enumeration of the likelihoods is not possible, and Monte-Carlo methods must be used to explore the posterior. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <ref> (Hastings 1970) </ref> was developed to evaluate and explore the posterior in this situation. This generates a sequence of dependent data (in this case configurations) from a Markov Chain with stationary distribution equal to the posterior distribution.

Reference-contexts: Extra variability can be incorporated by using a compound multinomial distribution <ref> (Mosimann 1962) </ref>, where the joint distribution of the cell probabilities follows a Dirichlet distribution. The rates could be modeled as some function of the distances from which the possible fathers are to the mother.
