Reference-contexts: The architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1. Our system is based on the Multi-Engine Machine Translation (MEMT) architecture <ref> ( Frederking, et al., 1994) </ref>. The system will integrate the following modules: Segmentation . The segmentation module will break the raw captioning stream up into individual sentences to be translated.

Reference-contexts: For each translated sentence or fragment, it assigns a score 4 indicating the estimated quality of the translation (this scoring mechanism is used by the Multi-Engine module to select the best translation overall). The KBMT module is realized through use of the KANT software <ref> ( Mitamura, et al., 1991) </ref>. KANT uses explicitly coded lexicons, grammars, and semantic rules to perform translation. KANT is also an interlingual system, making use of an explicit intermediate representation which acts as a pivot between the source and target languages.
