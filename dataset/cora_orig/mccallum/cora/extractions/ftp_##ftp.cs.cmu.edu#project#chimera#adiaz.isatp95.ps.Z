Abstract: Focusing on accessibility issues, this paper presents a qualitative measure of assembly task difficulty based on concepts from information theory. It is proposed that assembly task difficulty is directly proportional to the logarithm of the assembly task efficiency, this efficiency being a function of the average information content of the assembly task. Preliminary evaluation results are presented where the performance of this metric is tested. The results suggest that the new measure does a good job in capturing assembly difficulty as a function of assembly geometry.

Reference-contexts: Boothroyd <ref> [1] </ref> developed a method based on empirical data drawn from a set of experiments that provide 1 the hole increases as the geometry of the peg and the hole gets more complex. a relationship between design features and assembly times. <p> We propose to use a logarithmic relation (i.e., = ln) since that relation has shown to have some correlation with the empirical data <ref> [1] </ref>. The difficulty measure for task is defined to be D () = ln E () (13) If the geometry of the assembly changes in such a way that the efficiency decreases, the difficulty value for the assembly task increases. <p> Table 2 presents a summary of the different difficulty measures obtained for this assemblies. To verify that our method is giving meaningful values we took an example from the literature <ref> [1] </ref> and adapted it to fit our model. The experimental set up is shown in (Fig. 9). Bootrhoyd has measured the time it takes to make the initial engagement for machine screws Fig. 10.

Reference-contexts: The information provided by this method can be used to compare designs and/or to suggest modifications to existing designs. Although comprehensive, problems may arise when the assembly does not completely fit the data given. This can lead to inaccurate predictions on assembly times. Fitts <ref> [2] </ref> proposes the use of the index of difficulty to measure the performance of the human motor system in controlling movements that require high degree of dexterity. Sturges [3] use this concept to quantify human manual dexterity and extends his analysis to robotic manipulation.

Reference-contexts: The probability p k of the p-operation k will be given by the normalized q-values for the entire task . To associate a metric of information to the task , we borrow the concept of average 4 information content from Information Theory <ref> [11] </ref>: H () = i=1 The quantity log 2 (p k ) is called the information content of the p-operation k I (p-operation k ) = log 2 q k (10) The information content of the k-th p-operation will give a measure for the difficulty of executing it.
