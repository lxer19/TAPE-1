Abstract: A recent model of illusory contours is based on the assumption that the distribution of completion shapes can be modeled as a stochastic particle motion. The input for that model consists of a set of position and velocity constraints, (x i ; _x i ), derived from the image. Here we show how the velocity constraints (i.e., the _x i ) can be derived from the position constraints alone (i.e., the x i ). Let i and j range over all possible position-direction pairs where j _x i j = j _x j j = fl and let P ji be the probability that an illusory contour begins at x i with velocity _x i and ends at x j with velocity _x j . We observe that the limiting distribution of the random process with transition probability matrix, P(fl), is given by the eigenvector, s max (fl), with largest real positive eigenvalue, max (fl). We find that the graph of max (fl) for a Koffka Cross figure contains two distinct peaks|one at a low speed, fl circle , and a second at a higher speed, fl square . Simulations show that contours associated with fl circle are of circular shape while those associated with fl square are of square shape (i.e., they contain corners). For a Koffka Cross with narrow arms, max (fl circle ) &gt; max (fl square ). However, as the width of the arms is increased, the relative magnitudes of the two peaks reverses. This is consistent with the circle to square transition perceived by human observers.

Reference-contexts: For configurations of keypoints related through a scale change, we observe that the larger the configuration, the larger the speed which maximizes its salience. While open and closed contours are treated without explicit distinction, the latter are found to be more salient. This is in agreement with observation <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper we are especially interested in transitions between contour shape as the configuration of keypoints which the contour connects changes. For some configurations the eigenvalue will be maximized at lower speeds, and for other configurations at higher speeds.

Reference-contexts: When we compute completion-field distributions and contour saliencies, this directionality will play a crucial role. The calculation of P (jji) is straightforward, and having been given previously in some detail (see <ref> [2, 3] </ref>), need only be outlined here for completeness.

Reference-contexts: When we compute completion-field distributions and contour saliencies, this directionality will play a crucial role. The calculation of P (jji) is straightforward, and having been given previously in some detail (see <ref> [2, 3] </ref>), need only be outlined here for completeness. <p> There are 72 possible directions at each keypoint. The parameters defining the distribution of completion shapes are T ref = 0:0005 and t = 9:5. [For simplicity, we assume the pure Gaussian case described in <ref> [3] </ref>]. We evaluated max (fl) for the eight point test configuration over the velocity interval [1:1 1 0:909; 1:1 30 0:0573] using standard numerical routines. Figure 3 (solid) shows a plot of the magnitude of the largest, real positive eigenvalue, max vs. log 1:1 (1=fl). <p> In our first experiment, we use a Koffka Cross where d = 2:0 and w = 0:5. The parameters defining the distribution of contour shapes are: T ref = 0:0005; t = 9:5; ~ p = 100:0 and R p = 1:0 fi 10 8 (see <ref> [3] </ref>). The distributions were averaged over initial conditions modeled as Gaussians of variance 2 x = 2 = 0:0019. We evaluated max (fl) over the velocity interval [8:0fi1:1 1 14:54; 8:0fi1:1 80 0:004] using standard numerical routines.

Reference-contexts: In a previous paper, we noted how our use of directed contours enables contours to be extracted from noise much more reliably than with other techniques <ref> [4] </ref>. Of particular interest is N ji , the (relative) number of closed contours from i to j: N ji = s s C (k) is equal to P P j N jk . The continuation of closed contours ensures that P P j N jk for all k.
