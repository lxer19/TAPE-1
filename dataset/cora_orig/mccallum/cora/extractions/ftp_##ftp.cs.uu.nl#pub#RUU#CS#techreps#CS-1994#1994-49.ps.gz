Title: Complete Algorithms for Feeding Polyhedral Parts using Pivot Grasps  
Author: Anil Rao David Kriegman Ken Goldberg 
Note: Both algorithms are complete in that they are guaranteed to find pivot grasps when they exist.  
Affiliation: Utrecht University  Yale University  USC  
Abstract: To rapidly feed industrial parts on an assembly line, Carlisle et. al. [7] proposed a flexible part feeding system that drops parts on a flat conveyor belt, determines position and orientation of each part with a vision system, and then moves them into a desired orientation. A robot arm with 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) is capable of moving parts through 6 DoF when equipped with a passive pivoting axis between the parallel jaws of its gripper. The idea is to grasp a part with 2 hard finger contacts such that it pivots, under gravity, into a desired orientation when lifted and replaced on the table. We refer to these actions as pivot grasps. This paper considers the planning problem. Given a polyhedral part shape, coefficient of friction and a pair of stable configurations as input, find pairs of grasp points that will cause the part to pivot from one stable configuration to the other. For some transitions, pivot grasps may not exist. For a part with n faces and m stable configurations, we give an O(m 2 n log n) algorithm to generate the m fi m matrix of pivot grasps. When the part is star shaped, this reduces to O(m 2 n). We also study a generalization that considers capture regions around stable configurations.

Reference-contexts: For polyhedral parts, Erdmann et al. [10] showed how to tilt an infinite plane to orient a given polyhedral part, regardless of its initial orientation. Both Akella and Mason <ref> [1] </ref> and Lynch [23] addressed the planar problem of planning a strategy to move a part from a known pose into a desired final pose using a sequence of pushing operations. One goal of dextrous manipulation is to reorient a part while it is held in the hand [12].

Reference-contexts: Note that constraints 1, 2 and 4 can be expressed as polynomial inequalities, and therefore the set of valid grasps is a semi-algebraic set.

Reference-contexts: Each contact allows forces pointing into the associated friction cone. Clearly, such a grasp cannot achieve form closure: the part is free to rotate about the contact axis. For planar smooth objects, Faverjon and Ponce [11] and later, Blake <ref> [3] </ref>, considered computing frictional two-finger force-closure grasps. To achieve form closure, Markenscoff et al. [24] showed that four hard finger contacts are necessary and sufficient for planar objects and that twelve were sufficient (seven are necessary) to grasp 3D piecewise-smooth objects without rotational symmetries.

Reference-contexts: However for reorienting parts we do not require form closure; we must insure that the part will not translate when lifted but will in fact rotate about the grasp axis. In other words, we wish to control certain motions while preventing others. Brock <ref> [4] </ref> also considered controlled motions under grasp: given an external grasp on an object, represented as contact forces and torques, what are the (infinitesimal) motions possible? However, he does not study synthesizing grasps for a desired motion.

Reference-contexts: Following ideas presented by Brost <ref> [5] </ref>, the space of initial contact configurations S 2 can be partitioned into a set of m disjoint capture regions, each of which contains a stable pose. From any configuration in a region C ( ^ f ), the part will converge to the corresponding stable pose ^ f .

Reference-contexts: In the presence of obstacles, they showed how to plan regrasping operations for a 6 DoF robot arm by slicing C-space but did not provide a complete algorithm [29]. Automating the grasp analysis is useful for rapid set-up of a parts feeding system using vision and a robot manipulator <ref> [7] </ref>. An efficient algorithm is particularly useful when incorporated into a solid modelling package: as the designer creates a new part, he or she can immediately test the feedability of this part, perhaps modifying the shape accordingly. <p> In an industrial setting where cost, accuracy, reliability, and speed are paramount, Carlisle et al. <ref> [7] </ref> considered a SCARA-type arm with only 4 active DoF to feed a stream of parts arriving on a conveyor belt (see Fig. 1). Four degree of freedom manipulators, such a SCARA arm or Automatix Robot World module, are kinematically limited to orienting parts about the vertical axis. <p> We have tested some of these pivot grasps in the lab using an Adept robot arm (see <ref> [7] </ref>). We plan to extend the planning algorithms in several directions. Firstly, We would like to consider active pivoting, where the pivot axis is 17 actuated by a small motor and hence pivoting does not rely on gravity.

Reference-contexts: Explicitly computing this set is rather expensive, and so instead we will select a subset of G by posing some notion of an optimal grasp and then optimizing the criteria over the set G. There are a number of valid criteria (See <ref> [9] </ref>), and here we will consider a rather simple one; the same basic ideas can be applied to others.

Reference-contexts: One goal of dextrous manipulation is to reorient a part while it is held in the hand <ref> [12] </ref>. In a multi-fingered hand, a subset of fingers grasp the part while the other fingers move to a new grasp location.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is complete in the sense that whenever a sequence of exact pivot grasps exists, we are guaranteed to find it <ref> [14] </ref>. Note that the transition graph may not be strongly connected for this class of grasps; a sequence of exact pivot transitions between certain pairs of stable configurations may be impossible. <p> The algorithm is complete in the sense that whenever a valid pivot grasp exists, it will find one. Perhaps surprisingly, the problem of planning exact pivots is in fact solution-complete (borrowing terminology from <ref> [14] </ref>) i.e. a valid pivot grasp always exists if the part's center of gravity lies inside the part and grasp points have infinite friction. The interior center of gravity condition ensures that accessible grasps that effect any transition exist; the envelopes u (); l () cannot be empty.

Reference-contexts: Each envelope is a function of , and the edges of the envelope are ordered by increasing . By definition, points on these envelopes satisfy the accessibility condition. Each envelope can be computed in O (n log n) time <ref> [16] </ref>. However for polyhedra that are star-shaped with respect to their center of gravity, such as convex polyhedra, the intersection P consists of a single simple polygon. In such a case, the envelope can be computed in linear time via a sweep technique. 4.

Reference-contexts: Since u is non-smooth, stratified Morse theory can be applied to determine and classify the critical points of u; a subset of the equipotential contours through the saddle-like points define the boundary of the capture regions <ref> [20] </ref>. Consider for example, the part shown in Fig. 2; contact only occurs along its convex hull shown in Fig. 10a. First, the sphere of configurations is stratified according to the generalized normal of the hull. The supporting plane only contacts a face for a single configuration. <p> It contacts an edge along a curve of configurations given by the convex combination of the normals of the two incident faces, and it contacts a vertex along a region of sphere. Contact along an edge is depicted by the thicker arcs in Fig. 10b,c. It is shown in <ref> [20] </ref> that the boundary @C ( ^ f ) of the capture region C ( ^ f ) for configuration ^ f is composed of arcs of circles on the sphere.

Reference-contexts: We assume that each part is dropped onto the conveyor belt in isolation (we do not address the related problem of singulating parts). When rotations and translations in the plane are ignored, the part generally assumes one of a finite number of stable poses <ref> [22] </ref>. For a polyhedron P with n faces, a pose is stable when the center of gravity lies above the face of the convex hull H which contacts the support plane.
