Title: Incorporating Different Reection Models into Surface Reconstruction

Abstract: Generation of elevation maps of the seaoor is an important component of any autonomous system designed to navigate underwater. Because of its long range, sonar is the sensing medium of choice for underwater navigation. However, sonar systems designed to directly generate 3D images are generally complex or have low resolution. For these reasons, techniques that generate 3D elevation maps from 2D sonar intensity images are necessary for terrain modeling and navigation. Furthermore, recovering intrinsic terrain properties, such as albedo and surface roughness, is important for undersea mapping and exploration. This paper presents two techniques for the generation of elevation maps of the seaoor from side scan sonar intensity images and sparse bathymetric data. These techniques employ a reection model of the seaoor to establish a correspondence between the intensity at a point and the surface normal at that point. The first technique uses a constraint between the surface normal and the position of the sensor to generate a partial differential equation that describes the surface. This PDE is repeatedly solved using finite differences until the intensity from the surface is close to the actual intensity data. The second technique uses an iterative relaxation method to generate the surface by minimizing the difference between the intensity data and the calculated surface intensity. This technique is similar to shape from shading methods used in computer vision. In both techniques the sparse bathymetric data is used to generate an initial guess for the shape of the seaoor and an ini-tial guess for the reection model parameters. These techniques are designed to support different reection models, so they can be applied to different underwater environments. This is in contrast with other approaches that are generally less exible with respect to the reection model used. In addition to the elevation map of the seaoor, the parameters of the reection model at every point in the image are generated. These parameters describe material properties of the seaoor, so the maps of the reection model parameters can be used to segment the seaoor by material. Both techniques were tested on real and noisy synthetic data by comparing the calculated elevation map to the real elevation map. Using a lambertian reection model the average error in the elevation maps was found to be less than 0.5m at 150m range while the maximum error was less than 4.5m for an image with bathymetric data spaced evenly every 16m. Furthermore, for synthetic images, the parameter (albedo) of the reection model was calculated to within 5% of its actual value. On real data the actual albedo is not known, but qualitatively correct segmentation of albedo was obtained. In general the two methods performed equally well. Other reection models were used with similar results.

Reference-contexts: In all data sets this rapid divergence occurred in at most two control point regions. 3.2 METHOD 2: Relaxation The second method for updating the elevation map uses a relaxation technique similar to that used in shape from shading in computer vision <ref> [1] </ref>. In this method the iterations occur in two stages. The first stage updates the deriva-tives of j and the parameters of the reection model. The second stage updates j itself.

Reference-contexts: These incidence angles are then converted to elevation derivatives which are integrated together to form the surface of the seaoor. Most existing methods of seaoor reconstruction have used a specific reection model and somewhat arbitrarily selected reection model parameters for the seaoor to determine the incidence angles <ref> [3] </ref>. If the model and parameters are not guessed correctly then the integration will produce a surface that is not correct. Furthermore, if the integration does not have fixed starting and ending points accumulation of errors will force the surface away from its real value.

Reference-contexts: p that best fit the data I i with error s i in the control point region can be found by minimizing the chi square merit function for fitting the reection model to the data. (EQ 1) This function was minimized with the Levenberg-Marquadt Method for non-linear least squares minimization <ref> [7] </ref>. The resulting parameters will be the best fit parameters to the data in the control point region given the reection model and the intensity data. A virtue of this fitting method is that different reection models can be used simply by changing the function supplied to the minimization method.
