Reference-contexts: Furthermore, this warning message is (to the coercer), perfectly indistinguishable from the message the coercer wants sent. 1.1 Related Work In <ref> [BeTu94] </ref>, the idea of uncoercible communication is introduced in the narrow context of secret-ballot elections. That context is very limited since a voter's list of choices in an election is small, and the constraints are different since the voting process requires a form of external verifiability.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the closest prior work to uncoercible communication is the body of work exploring subliminal channels and the abuses they can allow. This idea was introduced in [Simm83] and methods of both exploiting and preventing these abuses are described in work including [Simm84], [Simm85], <ref> [Desm88a] </ref>, [Desm88b], and [Desm89]. The problem examined in this body of prior work is that of a sender transmitting a message to a recipient in the presence of an observer who is to be allowed to restrict the contents of the message.
