Abstract: To accelerate the design cycle for analog circuits and mixed-signal systems, we have proposed a top-down, constraint-driven design methodology [1]. In this paper we present a design which demonstrates the two principal advantagesthat this methodologyprovides-a high probability for first silicon which meets all specifications and fast design times. We examine the design of three different 10-bit digital-to-analog (D/A) converters beginning from their performance and functional specifications and ending with the testing of the fabricated parts. Critical technology mismatch information gathered from the testing phase is provided.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As the level of system integration increases, one apparent bottleneck is the design of the analog circuit components. Though these components are often small in area, their design times can be high. To address this problem we have proposed a top-down, constraint-driven design methodology <ref> [1] </ref>, and with it, have provided a variety of design tools such as behavioral level simulators, optimization tools, and physical layout tools. Higher-level tools such as module generators [2] have also been written.

Higher-level tools such as module generators <ref> [2] </ref> have also been written. To show the effectiveness of this methodology, we have undertaken design examples beginning with industrial-strength specifications, and not ending until the designs have been fabricated and tested. This paper presents a complete design flow of an interpolative switched current source D/A converter.

Reference-contexts: Using behavioral level simulations at the high-level in conjunction with circuit simulations at the low-level, the integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL) statistics for the entire D/A converter can be calculated on the order of minutes <ref> [3] </ref>. Costly full chip circuit simulation is not necessary. By decreasing simulation times, more system-level simulations can be completed, and thus, errors can be caught earlier in the design cycle; and trade-offs at the system level can be better examined. <p> R L , R M , R B Output resistances of the current sources in the linear, mirror, and binary array respectively. 4INL, 4DNL Errors introduced from block level routing. Table 2: Parameters for D/A Block The first is the behavioral simulator <ref> [3] </ref>. Its primary input parameters are the ones listed in Table 2, as well as some of the architectural, operational, and technological information found in Table 1. The simulator returns the statistical INL and DNL characteristics for the D/A converter. <p> A standard cell generator was used to synthesize the logic and latches needed for the D/A. With complete schematics from the low-level blocks, 4INL fl and 4DNL fl constraints, and layout information from the design specifications, the three analog blocks along with the digital block, are routed. <ref> [3] </ref> describes how 4INL and 4DNL are calculated. 3.4 Extraction and Verification During this final phase, a full layout extraction including routing parasitics is performed. <p> Then this plus 4INL and 4DNL is fed into the behavioral simulator which returns the INL and DNL statistics for the D/A generated. Sensitivity analysis at the behavioral level <ref> [3] </ref> is used to insure that extra parasitics introduced in the routing has not degraded the D/A's performance beyond the 4INL and 4DNL amount allocated. 4 Experimental Results We have fabricated three 10-bit D/As.

Given an N -bit digital word (D in ) and a reference current (I ref ), it returns an output current (I out ) which is proportional to D in . The converter has two stages.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that the behavioral simulator is implementation independent; the current sources do not have to be the ones shown in Figure 1. The simulations performed are valid for any current source circuit that can be characterized by the parameters in Table 2. A nonlinear optimizer <ref> [6] </ref> is the other tool that is invoked. This tool requires the performance and optimization information found in Table 1. The performances are used as constraints for the optimization problem. The objective function maximizes the flexibility or the chances that the low-level blocks can be implemented.

Reference-contexts: SPICE enhanced with a statistical package re ceives as inputs a set of W 's and L's corresponding to the main and cascode MOS devices along with architectural, operational, and technological information from Table 1, and returns i and R. The optimizer, employing a cutting plane algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>, minimizes the layout area subject to the constraints on i , R, and operating condition constraints from Table 1.

Reference-contexts: The binary array current sources are tiled together, and the summed currents are passed to a bank of switches. The linear array uses a standard two-dimensional structure <ref> [8] </ref>, with the addition of new decoding circuitry to select the interpolated output. To minimize sensitivity to process gradients, the binary array current sources are connected in a common centroid pattern, and the linear array devices are switched using a symmetrical switching pattern [8]. <p> linear array uses a standard two-dimensional structure <ref> [8] </ref>, with the addition of new decoding circuitry to select the interpolated output.

Reference-contexts: For example, Figure 8 shows that most of the mismatches are due to the center s1 (linear array) elements. Future designs can try to improve upon this. Component mismatches, in general, are caused by underlying basic statistical process variations. In this design, assumed were underlying process variations <ref> [11] </ref> [12] such as the flat band voltage variations, a VFB , and the standard deviation of the MOS transistor widths and lengths. Using the component mismatch data measured at two reference currents and using a basic mismatch formula [13], the process mismatches can estimated. Table 3 shows the results.
