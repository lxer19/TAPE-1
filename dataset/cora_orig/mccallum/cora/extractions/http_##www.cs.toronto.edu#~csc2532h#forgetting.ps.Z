Reference-contexts: To do so, she needs to forget about all the facts that are no longer true, and in such a way that this will not affect any of her possible future actions (Lin and Reiter <ref> [2; 3] </ref>). This paper describes in general terms the particular forms of forgetting used in (Lin and Reiter [2; 3]). Specifically, we propose a logical theory to account for: forgetting about a fact (forget that John is a student), and forgetting about a relation (forget the student relation). <p> she needs to forget about all the facts that are no longer true, and in such a way that this will not affect any of her possible future actions (Lin and Reiter <ref> [2; 3] </ref>). This paper describes in general terms the particular forms of forgetting used in (Lin and Reiter [2; 3]). Specifically, we propose a logical theory to account for: forgetting about a fact (forget that John is a student), and forgetting about a relation (forget the student relation). <p> For the two theories in the example, forgetting happens to be first-order definable. However, this is not true in general. For instance, a result from (Lin and Reiter <ref> [2] </ref>) implies that there is a finite first-order theory T , and a predicate P such that forget (T ; P ) is not first-order expressible. <p> This implies that the agent in this case should actively seek the truth value of student (J ohn), but not that of people (J ohn). As an extended example, consider again our motivating problem of progressing a database (Lin and Reiter <ref> [2] </ref>). Suppose D is a situation calculus theory of actions, and D S 0 an initial database.

Reference-contexts: of forgetting the remaining predicates P k+1 ; :::; P n in T , i.e., remember (T ; P 1 ; :::; P k ) = f orget (T ; P k+1 ; :::; P n ): The following result relates "remember only" to prime implicates (Reiter and de Kleer <ref> [4] </ref>) for propositional theories. Notice that for any propositional theory T , and any primitive proposition p, forget (T ; p) can be understood in two ways: as "forgetting about a fact" with p as a ground atom, and as "forgetting about a relation" with p as a 0-ary predicate.

Reference-contexts: In model-based diagnosis, given a system description T and a set O of observations, it turns out that remembering only the abnormality predicate ab in T [ O is precisely the maximally abstract diagnosis (Saraswat and de Kleer and Raiman <ref> [5] </ref>) of T and O. Our notion of forgetting is also closely related to so-called hidden or intermediate states: T can be considered to compute f orget (T ; P ) by using P as an intermediate predicate.

Reference-contexts: We consider our main contributions to be in proposing a coherent semantics, and showing that it has the desired properties. A radically different approach is taken by Subrama-nian <ref> [6] </ref>. A fundamental difference between our definition and Subramanian's is that hers does not in general preserve logical equivalence. It is to a large degree syntax oriented in the sense that the result of forgetting depends on the syntactic forms of theories.

Reference-contexts: For sensor readings are always about the current state. In particular, knowledge about the past can never be directly obtained from perception. 4 Related Work In the propositional case, Weber <ref> [7] </ref> has proposed ' + p _ ' as a form of forgetting, and used it to formalize database updates. In the first-order case, Vladimir Lifschitz 3 has 3 Personal communication. proposed (9Q)'(P=Q) as a formalization of forgetting about P in '.
