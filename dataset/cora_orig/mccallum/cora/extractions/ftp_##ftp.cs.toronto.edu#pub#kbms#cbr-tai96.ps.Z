Abstract: Classification involves associating instances with particular classes by maximizing intra-class similarities and minimizing inter-class similarities. The paper presents a novel approach to case-based classification. The algorithm is based on a notion of similarity assessment and was developed for supporting flexible retrieval of relevant information. Validity of the proposed approach is tested on real world domains, and the system's performance is compared to that of other machine learning algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that the categories are known a priori from a prescribed domain theory [38]. Various reasoning techniques have been utilized for the classification task, including neural networks [37], genetic algorithms [12], inductive and instance-based learning <ref> [1, 28, 37, 40, 36] </ref> and case-based reasoning [31, 4, 15]. Individual approaches are compared to each other based on the method they deploy, the accuracy they achieve, and the complexity of the used algorithm. Most of the systems extract classification rules from training examples during a learning process.

Reference-contexts: Individual systems are usually tested on different problem domains, and because of differences in domain complexities, obtained performance measures cannot be compared directly. While performance is highly domain dependent, it is possible to derive evaluation techniques which allow for a meaningful performance comparison of different algorithms <ref> [2, 28] </ref>. This paper presents a novel case-based classification scheme and evaluates it on several real world domains. The algorithm is based on a notion of relevance assessment [16]. Its flexibility is accomplished by using context in similarity-based retrieval, deploying Telos [29] representation language which treats objects and attributes uniformly. <p> This allows for making each and every attribute potentially significant as well as assigning objects to different classes. The system also allows for identifying hierarchies of attributes, selecting common attributes and distinguishing attributes between classes. IB1 <ref> [2, 5] </ref> is a nearest-neighbor, instance-based learning system used for classification and for control tasks. Based on a problem description, IB1 retrieves the k-nearest neighbors and uses them to supply a solution to a given problem. <p> An approximate answer can be iteratively improved, so that the change between approximate and accurate answer is continuous. 4 Performance Evaluation Performance evaluation must be conducted with a special care on the used data set and on the selected measures <ref> [2] </ref>. It is not only important to know what to measure when evaluating a system but also to know how to interpret the results. There are many accepted benchmarks used in different fields and there are numerous evaluations available. <p> The second characteristic measures how long it takes for the system to perform the specified task. In addition, scalability measures task/time performance dependability on the case base size. It should be noted, that accuracy is not only system dependent but is also strongly domain dependent <ref> [2] </ref>. In [28] a fair evaluation criterion is suggested to measure classification accuracy. The motivation for the study is that a simple comparison of classification accuracy might be misleading. <p> TA3 Robot 2 used attribute value relaxation first, and only when this failed was cardinality relaxation performed. 4.4 Problem 4: Character Recognition Do main The letter classification task has previously been used for machine learning algorithm testing <ref> [12, 2] </ref>. 3 The data set consists of 20,000 instances described by 17 attributes: letter, horizontal and vertical position of a box, width and height of a box, total number of pixels, etc.

Reference-contexts: Although it has been acknowledged that context plays a central role in determining similarity, previous works on similarity measures for case-based reasoning generally assume that context is implicit in the case representation, or is acquired through machine learning techniques <ref> [8] </ref>. We define context as a parameter of a similarity relation and demonstrate the monotonicity of case retrieval. A case, C, corresponds to a real world situation, represented as a structured object with relations [29].

Reference-contexts: In the system, classification is combined with explanation. Explanation is used for justifying case classification and for determining similarity between two cases. An incremental retrieval system, I-CBR, is presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. For this case-based reasoning paradigm, the user specifies a case skeleton and attempts to retrieve all cases similar to it. I-CBR partitions case attributes into two groups: the ones which are known immediately and the ones that need some extra effort for specifying them. <p> Using different context and criteria affects the time spent on searching for the solution as well as the quality of the solution. TA3 allows for tuning up the reasoning to meet different requirements, similarly as in <ref> [10] </ref>. On the one hand, in the medical domain [25, 24], a more accurate suggestion for the hormonal therapy has a positive impact on pregnancy and is also cost effective, since it minimizes the quantity of hormones given to the patient.

Reference-contexts: Based on the proposed theory, we have applied the research prototype T A3 to several real world domains: 1 a medical domain (T A3 IV F ) [25, 24], a servo-mechanism (T A3 Servo ) and robotic domain (T A3 Robot ) <ref> [21, 22] </ref>, a letter classification domain (T A3 Letter ) [19] and a small software case base (T A3 SR ) [18]. Each domain has different characteristics and thus allows for a better performance evaluation. Retrieved cases were used for predicting unknown values for attributes. <p> This is a complex task which might be computationally intractable for complex systems. In such situations, other methods are used to approximate the solution. In our study we used an existing small robot as an example. Robot's parameters are presented in <ref> [21] </ref>. One obvious need for the inverse kinematic task is during planning a robot's end-effector is at point 7 X and should be moved to point Y . For example, in welding the usual task is to follow a particular curve during the process. <p> Thus, even though the treatment should be suggested reasonably fast, clearly accuracy is more important. On the other hand, in the robotic domain <ref> [21] </ref>, time resources are limited. Thus, even an approximate solution provided in real time has a higher value than an accurate solution delivered late. In the inverse kinematic task, there are fast techniques available to produce an accurate solution from an approximate one.

Individual approaches are compared to each other based on the method they deploy, the accuracy they achieve, and the complexity of the used algorithm. Most of the systems extract classification rules from training examples during a learning process. <p> Individual systems are usually tested on different problem domains, and because of differences in domain complexities, obtained performance measures cannot be compared directly. While performance is highly domain dependent, it is possible to derive evaluation techniques which allow for a meaningful performance comparison of different algorithms <ref> [2, 28] </ref>. This paper presents a novel case-based classification scheme and evaluates it on several real world domains. The algorithm is based on a notion of relevance assessment [16]. Its flexibility is accomplished by using context in similarity-based retrieval, deploying Telos [29] representation language which treats objects and attributes uniformly. <p> The second characteristic measures how long it takes for the system to perform the specified task. In addition, scalability measures task/time performance dependability on the case base size. It should be noted, that accuracy is not only system dependent but is also strongly domain dependent [2]. In <ref> [28] </ref> a fair evaluation criterion is suggested to measure classification accuracy. The motivation for the study is that a simple comparison of classification accuracy might be misleading.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a novel case-based classification scheme and evaluates it on several real world domains. The algorithm is based on a notion of relevance assessment [16]. Its flexibility is accomplished by using context in similarity-based retrieval, deploying Telos <ref> [29] </ref> representation language which treats objects and attributes uniformly. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the classification problem and presents various approaches to the problem. Section 3 introduces the approach to context-based relevance used to define similarity-based retrieval and case-based classification. <p> We define context as a parameter of a similarity relation and demonstrate the monotonicity of case retrieval. A case, C, corresponds to a real world situation, represented as a structured object with relations <ref> [29] </ref>. Objects and relations are repre sented as a set of attributes and their values, denoted C = f&lt; a 0 : V 0 &gt;; ; &lt; a n : V n &gt;g, where &lt; a i : V i &gt; is an attribute/value pair. <p> Here, the case is a collection of five attributes with values: Example 1 MOTOR: E SCREW: D PGAIN: 4 VGAIN: 5 RISE_TIME: 0.28125095 Using the information about the usefulness of individual attributes and its properties, attributes are grouped into one or more Telos-style categories <ref> [29] </ref>. In a servo domain (see Section 4.2), three categories are used: motor and screw form the first category, pgain and vgain comprise the second category, and the last category is the class rise time.

Reference-contexts: Performance degradation of IB1 with the number of irrelevant attributes can be solved either by data pre-processing (removing all irrelevant attributes) or by the use of an intelligent, selective partial matching algorithm. The latter approach is similar to m of n concepts in machine learning <ref> [30] </ref>, i.e., the system considers only m &lt; n attributes during retrieval. There are various methods used to decide m and Ortega [30] presents an evaluation of system performance for various m. <p> The latter approach is similar to m of n concepts in machine learning <ref> [30] </ref>, i.e., the system considers only m &lt; n attributes during retrieval. There are various methods used to decide m and Ortega [30] presents an evaluation of system performance for various m. In addition to deciding the size of m, the approach described in this paper allows for specifying which attributes to exclude and for posing additional constraints on attribute values, if desired. <p> Cardinality Relaxation. The satisfiability definition can be relaxed so that a case, represented by n attributes, may satisfy a context if it matches the context for some specified number m &lt; n attributes, rather than requiring all the attribute constraints in the context be satisfied <ref> [30] </ref>. We call this cardinality relaxation. Consider the example presented in Example 3. <p> The main advantage of the context-based approach is that classification does not degrade with irrelevant attributes, since they can be ignored during the retrieval process and thus would not affect the solution, similarly as in <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In general, this process consists of: first generating a set of categories and then classifying given objects into the created categories. For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that the categories are known a priori from a prescribed domain theory <ref> [38] </ref>. Various reasoning techniques have been utilized for the classification task, including neural networks [37], genetic algorithms [12], inductive and instance-based learning [1, 28, 37, 40, 36] and case-based reasoning [31, 4, 15]. <p> Some attribute values might be missing or there may be irrelevant attributes present and relevant attributes missing. Such domains are called imperfect. In a conventional data analysis, objects are clustered into classes based on a distance (similarity) measure <ref> [38] </ref>. The similarity between two objects is represented as a number the value of a similarity function applied to symbolic descriptions of objects. Thus, the similarity measure is context free. <p> Thus, the similarity measure is context free. Note that such methods fail to capture the properties of a cluster as a whole and are not derivable from properties of individual entities <ref> [38] </ref>. <p> ID3 [33] is a classification system based on a decision tree algorithm. Using the induction from training examples, ID3 generates a decision tree a classification rule that examines the values of some attributes of an object in order to assign it into a proper class. AC 3 <ref> [38] </ref> is a classification algorithm based on attribute-based conjunctive conceptual clustering - a way of grouping objects into conceptually simple classes. Using this method, a set of objects forms a class only if it can be described by a conjunctive concept involving relations on object attributes.

Reference-contexts: The membership is defined either using domain knowledge (if available) or using a knowledge discovery algorithm [11, 19, 24]. This grouping allows for ascribing different constraints to different groups of attributes, and the process of retrieving relevant cases can be described as a constraint satisfaction process <ref> [39, 13, 27] </ref>. Categories allow for improved system performance, as will be shown later. An explicitly specified context allows for less strict matching than equivalence. The goal is to retrieve not only exact matches (equivalent cases), but partial matches (similar cases) as well.
