Abstract: A natural architecture for nanoscale quantum computation is that of a quantum cellular automaton. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we begin an investigation of exactly unitary cellular automata. After proving that there can be no nontrivial, homogeneous, local, unitary, scalar cellular automaton in one dimension, we weaken the homogeneity condition and show that there are nontrivial, exactly unitary, partitioning cellular automata. We find a one parameter family of evolution rules which are best interpreted as those for a one particle quantum automaton. This model is naturally reformulated as a two component cellular automaton which we demonstrate to limit to the Dirac equation. We describe two generalizations of this automaton, the second of which, to multiple interacting particles, is the correct definition of a quantum lattice gas.

Reference-contexts: QCA, therefore, provide a laboratory for analyzing both potential quantum computer architectures and algorithms; this is the motivation for initiating our study of them in this paper. Computation motivated study of QCA seems to have originated with the interesting work of Grossing and Zeilinger <ref> [13] </ref>. Their models, however, are only approximately quantum mechanical because, they argue, "except for the trivial case, strictly local, unitary evolution of the whole QCA array is impossible" [14]. Consequently, they study CA whose evolution is both nonunitary [13] and, although `probability' preserving, nonlinear [14]. <p> seems to have originated with the interesting work of Grossing and Zeilinger <ref> [13] </ref>.

Consequently, they study CA whose evolution is both nonunitary [13] and, although `probability' preserving, nonlinear [14]. In Section 2 we begin by proving the following precise version of their claim: NO-GO LEMMA. In one dimension there exists no nontrivial, homogeneous, local, scalar QCA. <p> which evolve simply by translation are not very interesting, so Grossing and Zeilinger relax the unitarity constraint, setting w 1 = iffi; w 0 = 1; w +1 = i ffi; so that the evolution is only approximately unitary, with errors of O (jffij 2 ) accumulating at each timestep <ref> [13] </ref>. Since the evolution is nonunitary, quantum probability is not preserved. Instead, all the amplitudes are normalized by an overall factor at each step to make P x j t (x)j 2 = 1; this may be thought of as a nonlocal (and non-quantum mechanical) aspect of the evolution [14].

Section 3 contains output from several simulations of one dimensional QCA. Simulation on a deterministic computer must inevitably be slow, but this is acceptable since our goal here is understanding rather than the solution of any specific problem.

As usual, of course, exactly solvable does not mean that expectation values of all observables can be computed; even in the restricted parameter domain corresponding to probabilistic evolution only certain correlation functions have been computed [34].

Decoherence of the quantum state either in memory registers [22] or acted on by logical gates [23] places tight constraints on the number of computational steps which a quantum computer might perform reliably.

In a more general context than regularizing continuum quantum field theories, the considerations involved here in imposing unitarity and locality on a discrete theory are also relevant to the causal set program for quantum gravity [30,41].
