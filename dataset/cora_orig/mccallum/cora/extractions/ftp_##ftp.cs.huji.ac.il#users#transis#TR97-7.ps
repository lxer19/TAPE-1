Abstract: This paper is submitted to the GlobeCom'97 conference. Technical Area: Multicast services in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Networks. Abstract This paper presents congress: a CONnection-oriented Group-address RESolution Service. congress is an efficient native ATM protocol for resolution and management of multicast group addresses in an ATM WAN and complements the native ATM multicast mechanisms. congress is not concerned with application data transmission, but only resolves multicast group addresses for applications. Applications can use the resolved addresses, in order to implement a many-to-many communication model. congress employs hierarchically organized servers in order to be scalable. congress' hierarchy is naturally mapped onto the ATM Private Network to Network Interface peer group hierarchy. congress communication overhead for management of a single multicast group is linear in the size of the group.

Reference-contexts: This model is abstracted by the multicast group (M uG) concept. In order to implement a M uG most efficiently and not to compromise the ATM QoS, native ATM multicast facilities should be exploited. ATM facilitates multicast communication by providing a point-to-multipoint (ptmpt) connection type <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. This type of connection unidirectionally connects a single source ATM end-point (termed the root) to multiple destination ATM end-points (termed leaves). A M uG can be implemented using either a mesh of ptmpt connections or a multicast server.

This information (to which we refer in the rest of the paper as group membership information) is needed at connection set-up time. In the ATM Forum specification of UNI 4.0 <ref> [4] </ref> the question of how to obtain the identities of the ptmpt connection participants is left open, and the existence of some external directory service or other mechanism is assumed. However, the scaling of such a service to a WAN is not a trivial task.
