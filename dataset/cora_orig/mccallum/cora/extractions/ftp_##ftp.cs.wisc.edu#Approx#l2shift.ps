Abstract: A complete characterization is given of closed shift-invariant subspaces of L 2 (IR d ) which provide a specified approximation order. When such a space is principal (i.e., generated by a single function), then this characterization is in terms of the Fourier transform of the generator. As a special case, we obtain the classical Strang-Fix conditions, but without requiring the generating function to decay at infinity. The approximation order of a general closed shift-invariant space is shown to be already realized by a specifiable principal subspace.

For fractional , we have the following subadditivity property: (5:13) fi2I W W whenever, say, f fi g fi is a disjoint collection of cubes; (cf. [A; p.225]).

Reference-contexts: Such cases are known and are of interest in both spline theory (e.g., exponential box splines, cf. [DR]) and radial basis function theory (cf. the detailed discussion in <ref> [BR2] </ref>). In the non-scaling case, we employ a family fS h g h of shift-invariant spaces, and consider the rates of decay of E (f; S h h ) as a function of h. <p> There is a rich literature of clarifications and extensions of the Strang-Fix result, including extensions to noncompactly supported ([BH2], [J2], [DM2], [BJ], [B1], [R], [CL], [JL], [HL] <ref> [BR2] </ref>). <p> Our theorem, though, does not require to decay at 1 at any particular rate, thus obviating the search for such . Results (weaker than the above theorem) about L 1 (IR d )-approximation orders, that apply to functions which decay only mildly at 1, were derived in <ref> [BR2] </ref>. The approach there exploits the fact that the exponential functions e , 2 IR d , are in the space in which approximation takes place. In contrast, the approach here makes use of the simple and explicit formula for the orthogonal projection onto d S (). 2. <p> Hence, (3:6) E (f; S (g fl )) = (2) d=2 k (1 C ) b f k: This allows us to show easily that the space S (g fl ) provides approximation and density order k for all k 0. For this, we follow the example of <ref> [BR2] </ref> and consider, equivalently, the approximation of the scaled function f h := f (h) from the fixed space S instead of the approximation of the function f from the scaled space S h . <p> This shows that the necessity of the Strang-Fix conditions (1.11) for k-approximation order holds in a very general setting. This is remarkable, since this implication is considered to be the "harder" one. An analogous L 1 -result has been obtained in <ref> [BR2] </ref> by other means. We now consider in more detail sufficient conditions for approximation order. <p> Circumventing the polynomial reproduction argument was actually the major objective of <ref> [BR2] </ref>. In our context, Theorem 1.6 leads to a remarkable result, which allows (5.12) to be replaced by a much weaker condition, and which we now describe. For this result, we need a local version W 2 () of the potential spaces W 2 (IR d ).

Unfortunately, the decay conditions (5.12) fail to hold for many functions of interest (primarily radial basis functions, and usually because b is not smooth enough at 0), and in such a case, the polynomial reproduction argument either fails, or is not easily converted into approximation orders.

Reference-contexts: Strang and Fix <ref> [SF] </ref> have treated the approximation properties of the space S ? () of all linear combinations P ff2ZZ d ( ff)c (ff) (finite or not) of the integer shifts of a compactly supported function . <p> In this connection, it is worthwhile to point out (as is done in <ref> [SF] </ref>) that positive controlled approximation order forces b (0) 6= 0. There is a rich literature of clarifications and extensions of the Strang-Fix result, including extensions to noncompactly supported ([BH2], [J2], [DM2], [BJ], [B1], [R], [CL], [JL], [HL] [BR2]). <p> The Strang-Fix conditions As mentioned in the introduction, approximation orders from the scaled spaces fS h g h were characterized in <ref> [SF] </ref> under the assumptions that (a) the space S h is obtained as the h-dilate of the same principal shift-invariant space S (); (b) the generator of S () is compactly supported; and (c) the approximation order is realized in a controlled manner.
