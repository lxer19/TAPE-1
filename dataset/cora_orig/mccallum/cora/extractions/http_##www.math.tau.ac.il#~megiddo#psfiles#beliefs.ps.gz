Title: ON COMPUTABLE BELIEFS OF RATIONAL MACHINES  
Author: Nimrod Megiddo 
Abstract: Traditional decision theory has assumed that agents have complete, consistent and readily available beliefs and preferences. Obviously, even if an expert system has complete and consistent beliefs, it cannot have them readily available. Moreover, some beliefs about beliefs are not even approximately computable. It is shown that if all players have complete and consistent beliefs, they can compute approximate beliefs about beliefs of any order by considering events arbitrarily close in some well-defined sense to the ones in question.

Reference-contexts: However, the important property is that there exists an effective procedure for translating numbers into programs and vice versa. In our model there are two computers C 1 ; C 2 . In the beginning these computers are empty (like the "empty shells" in <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> ). They are then loaded with programs X 1 ; X 2 , respectively. The symbols X 1 ; X 2 should be interpreted as random variables whose values are names of programs, or Godel numbers.

Reference-contexts: The sense of the word `has' in the preceding sentence is that all the probabilities are readily available. Of course, the beliefs are subject to Bayesian updating whenever some new information is received. There has recently been interest in modeling players as computing machines (see for example <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> ). If the decision maker is a computer program (an "expert system"), rather than an ideal player as in the traditional theory, its beliefs are not readily available. The program may have consistent beliefs which it can only approximate with arbitrary precision.

Reference-contexts: Our discussion here should be considered an extension to the foundations of games with incomplete information played by Bayesian players. Beliefs about beliefs have also been considered by philosophers, mathematicians and computers scientists. Some references on beliefs can be found in <ref> [ 5; 4; 3; 7 ] </ref> . 2. On levels of belief For the benefit of readers who have not been exposed to the issues of beliefs, we first demonstrate the complications involved in beliefs of players about each other. To simplify the discussion consider henceforth only 2-person games.

However, the questions of computability have not been addressed in this context. In this paper players take on the form of programs residing in computers. We are concerned with the issue of beliefs of programs about other programs and their beliefs.
