Abstract: Internet transmission and switching facilities are partitioned into different administrative domains. To effect routing between domains, domain border routers establish pairwise peering sessions and exchange routing information at exchange points. An alternative arrangement, in which each border router at an exchange point peers only with a Route Server, provides some operational benefits. From a set-theoretic characterization of border router behavior, we derive a set-theoretic expression that completely and succinctly characterizes Route Server functionality. Performance measurements from our Route Server implementation reveal that the storage requirements of Route Servers can be much larger than that of a typical border router. We discuss a variety of techniques that can, in some cases, reduce Route Server storage requirements by a factor of five or more.

Reference-contexts: An alternative mechanism for injecting external routes into OSPF uses a single route server which, configured with domain policy, performs the same function. This use of the route server simplifies domain routing configuration. The RIPE Route Server <ref> [1] </ref> is a precursor to our RS. RIPE's Route Server is also designed to compute inter-domain routing tables, on behalf of domain BRs attached to an exchange point.

Reference-contexts: If all routes in the subset are assigned 1, do not select any route for inclusion in the result set. If more than one route in the subset has the highest preference, break ties according to rules specified in <ref> [3] </ref>. The third step in Section 2.1 applies BR a 's universal export criteria to compute its exportable routes. <p> Include the resulting route in the result set. For example, this step would set r's EXT_INFO attribute if BR a were originating the advertisement for route r. A more detailed description of an IDRP speaker's handling of such attributes may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. Finally, the fourth step described in Section 2.1 applies BR a 's peer-specific export criteria to compute BR a 's outputs. <p> For example, this step would either set a configured value for the MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute or pass unmodified the received value (which may be, for instance, a metric learned from intra-domain routing). A more detailed description of an IDRP speaker's handling of such attributes may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. Combining Equations 1, 2, and 3, we can easily express BR a 's outputsthe sets o S a;y in terms of its inputs, the sets i S a;x . 2.3 Discussion For brevity, we have just sketched the definitions of set functions I, H, P, and E. <p> We have assumed that an IDRP speaker advertises to its peer at most one route per address prefix. Actually, an IDRP speaker may advertise, at most one route per address prefix per QoS value (or the values of other IDRP attributes like EXPENSE and TRANSIT_DELAY <ref> [3] </ref>). <p> Using this address, BR a forwards data packets directly to BR x . In IDRP, a BR is not required to assign a value to the NEXT_HOP attribute of a route it propagates <ref> [3] </ref>; recipients of such a route implicitly assume that the value of this attribute is the sender's network-layer address. Therefore, in the mesh, BR a may receive the same route r from BR x , but without the NEXT_HOP set; in the corresponding star, though, this attribute would be set.

Reference-contexts: An IDPR route server computes this source route on behalf of a client domain, using global link-state topology information. Unlike an IDPR route server, our RS computes hop-by-hop routing tables satisfying its client domains' policy requirements. Like IDPR, the Unified inter-domain routing architecture <ref> [5] </ref> also uses the term route server to denote an entity that computes domain-level source routes (or fragments thereof) on behalf of domain BRs. <p> the condition for functional equivalence, it is possible to extend view decomposition techniques to further reduce RS storage requirements; the paper does not discuss such approaches. 18 As described in Section 8, our RS can also be used to compute specialized domain-level source routes or source-route fragments in the Unified <ref> [5] </ref> architecture. Apart from using the path vectors contained in IDRP routes for this purpose, the RS can also compute these specialized source routes directly from information maintained in the Routing Arbiter Routing Registry.

Reference-contexts: As we show later, the star can reduce BR storage requirements as well. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some current high-end router products are limited in the number of peering sessions they can concurrently process [9]; memory limitations of Internet backbone routers are well documented <ref> [8] </ref>. Finally, since the RS is directly configured from the policy database, star peering at Internet exchange points is an incentive for maintaining the currency of registered policies. Some of these advantages are particularly relevant at large exchange points.

Reference-contexts: The term route server is also used, in a slightly different sense, in the OSPF intra-domain routing protocol specification <ref> [12] </ref>. In OSPF, domain BRs inject external routing information into intra-domain routing. Domain policies, usually configured into each domain BR, govern this dissemination of external routing information into OSPF.

Reference-contexts: These existing exchange points have been established less from basic architectural considerations and more for economic reasons (e.g., operational cost amortization over providers connected to the exchange point); however, the National Science Foundation's proposed program for a commercial Internet <ref> [13] </ref> incorporates exchange points (called Network Access Points, or NAPs) into the routing infrastructure design, thereby conferring upon them first-class status. With this development, and with the expected proliferation of Internet providers, the number of attached BRs at exchange points is likely to grow.

Reference-contexts: In the current Internet routing infrastructure, the former is supported by inter-domain routing and the latter by intra-domain routing. In the near future, inter-domain routing is likely to be achieved using the Inter-Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP 1 ) <ref> [15] </ref>. IDRP supports data exchange between different domains, but in a manner that does not conflict with domain autonomy and heterogeneity.

Reference-contexts: Global knowledge of routing policies facilitates the use of Route Servers (RSs) at exchange points. At an exchange point, each provider BR usually establishes an IDRP peering session with every other BR; we call such a peering arrangement a mesh 1 The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) version 4 <ref> [16] </ref> is currently deployed on the Internet. IDRP is a superset of BGP version 4. Our conclusions are equally applicable for BGP. 1 topologies. In mesh peering, each BR peers with every other BR at the exchange point. In star peering, each BR peers only with an RS.

Reference-contexts: This solution also approximately halves the computational and storage complexity at each RS. The approach easily generalizes to more than two RSs. No inter-RS synchronization is necessary, but some additional configuration may be necessary at each BR. 8 Related Work Inter-domain Policy Routing (IDPR) <ref> [18] </ref> is an architecture for source-specified policy routing. When using IDPR to send data to different address prefixes, each domain uses a domain-level source route satisfying its policy requirements. An IDPR route server computes this source route on behalf of a client domain, using global link-state topology information.

Reference-contexts: Our RS, while clearly a part of the hop-by-hop component, can function as a Unified route server; to craft a domain-level source route to an address prefix, a domain BR can query the RS for the path vectors associated with IDRP routes to that address prefix <ref> [19] </ref>. The term route server is also used, in a slightly different sense, in the OSPF intra-domain routing protocol specification [12]. In OSPF, domain BRs inject external routing information into intra-domain routing. Domain policies, usually configured into each domain BR, govern this dissemination of external routing information into OSPF.
