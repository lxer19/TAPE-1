Abstract: We introduce and apply a new cw photomodulation technique, measured far from the steady-state, for obtaining the action spectra of the photogeneration quantum efficiency of neutral and charged excitations in films of a ladder-type poly(para-phenylene). Whereas the photogeneration action spectrum for singlet excitons shows a step function increase at a photon energy, E, close to the optical gap, both triplet and polaron photogeneration action spectrum show, in addition a monotonous rise at higher E. The rise for triplets is explained by singlet exciton fission into triplet pairs, whereas for polarons it is modeled by a hot-exciton dissociation mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Typeset using REVT E X 1 The photogeneration dynamics of singlet excitons and secondary photoexcitations, such as triplets and polarons, in -conjugated polymers have been usually measured by picosecond (ps) transient spectroscopic techniques rather than cw spectroscopies, since their photogen-eration processes usually occur in the subnanosecond time domain <ref> [1] </ref>. On the other hand, the excited states energy levels are often measured in these polymers by cw optical techniques, including electroabsorption [2], resonant Raman scattering [3] and two and three photon non-linear optical spectroscopies [4].

Reference-contexts: of methyl-bridged ladder-type poly (para-phenylene) [mLPPP] (Fig.1 inset). mLPPP is an attractive -conjugated polymer for blue-light emitting diodes [5] and photopumped lasers [6] due to its high photolumines-cence quantum yield; this is caused in part by the intrachain order in the film induced by the planarization of neighboring phenyl rings <ref> [7] </ref>. We found that whereas the PQE action spectrum for the photoluminescence comprises of a step-function response at E close to the optical gap, E op '2.6eV, the PQE action spectrum for both triplet excitons and polarons also contains a monotonous rise at E&gt;E op . <p> However BR kinetics is not trivial for the triplet excitons; our results show, therefore that triplet-triplet annihilation, where dT 1 =dt ~ flT 2 1 is dominant in mLPPP, in contrast to T 1 kinetics in other polymers [14]. We note that the neat, planarized mLPPP backbone structure <ref> [7] </ref> may increase triplet diffussion in these films, thus promoting BR kinetics. Fig. 2 right inset shows T () of triplets for both components; T in (at 15Hz and I=100mW) and T Q (at 4kHz and I=50mW). <p> From the fit to the data points (Fig. 4) we obtained for the tunneling model W=5.6eV, in excellent agreement with electron affinity measurements in mLPPP [5]; using m fl e =0.1m e we also obtained d=12 A, in reasonable agreement with neighboring interchain distance in mLPPP films <ref> [7] </ref>. In summary, we introduce a novel cw spectroscopic method based on action spectra of various PA bands in the PM spectrum, measured under conditions far from the steady state, for obtaining the PQE dynamics of photoexcitations in -conjugated polymers.

Reference-contexts: The PM spectrum was obtained by dividing the changes T, caused by the pump beam excitation, by the probe transmission T, where T was measured by a phase sensitive technique. We note that (T =T ) = N d, <ref> [8] </ref> where N is the photoexcitation density, is their optical cross-section and d is the film thickness. Both in-phase, T in and quadrature, T Q were measured in our studies as a function of pump excitation intensity I, modulation frequency f and temperature .

Reference-contexts: We thus obtain from the higher (E) onset at 3.2eV a value E T '1.6eV. The fit through the data points has been obtained <ref> [9] </ref> using exciton fission with E T =1.6eV, a chain length distribution and an energy dependent fission yield involving emission of the most strongly coupled vibrations (h!'0.15eV) using the Huang-Rhys ansatz. We note that the singlet exciton energy E S 'E op '2.6eV, is much larger than E T ('1.6eV).

Reference-contexts: Thus studies focused on the photoexcitation generation process via the E and dependencies of can be readily achieved with cw techniques, 3 measured far from the StS. We note that in previous studies <ref> [10] </ref>, T frequency dependence was analyzed at StS and non-StS conditions; however, that T Q for ft 1 does not depend on t was not realized and thus basically ignored.

Reference-contexts: In Fig. 2 we show the PM spectrum of a spin-cast mLPPP film at =80K, excited at E=3.5eV. The PM spectrum is dominated by the photoinduced absorption band T 1 at 1.3eV, which is due to an optical transition in the triplet manifold related to the photogen-erated triplet excitons <ref> [11] </ref>, and by two correlated PA bands: P 1 and P 2 at 0.4 and 1.9eV, respectively, that are due to intra-gap optical transitions related to photogenerated polarons [12]; a series of photoinduced IR-active vibrations (IRAV) that are correlated with the PA bands P 1 and P 2 are also seen

Reference-contexts: The photobleaching (PB) feature in Fig. 2 marks the mLPPP optical gap, E op '2.6eV <ref> [13] </ref>, at the onset of the photoluminescence (PL) band. 4 The left inset in Fig. 2 shows the PA laser excitation dependence, T in (G) at 100Hz for T 1 and P 1 PA bands. <p> This step function behaviour is similar to that measured in the best PPV films [16], and shows that singlet excitons are the primary excitations in mLPPP, as can be also inferred from the large exciton binding energy (0.5eV) obtained for this polymer <ref> [13] </ref>. At longer times triplet excitons are formed in mLPPP, as may be concluded from the existence of the T 1 PA band in the PM spectrum (Fig. 2).

Reference-contexts: At f'4kHz, the quadrature PL component (PL) Q =0, since the PL lifetime t P L (&lt;1ns <ref> [15] </ref>) is sufficiently short to imply StS conditions (i.e. ft t1). In addition, we measured the absolute PQE value for the PL, P L with an integrating sphere, and found P L '30% at E=3.5eV. From this value and (PL) in vs. E we obtained P L vs.

Reference-contexts: E we obtained P L vs. E as shown in Fig. 3 inset. It is seen that P L (E) abruptly increases at E=2.4eV, followed by a constant value at higher E. This step function behaviour is similar to that measured in the best PPV films <ref> [16] </ref>, and shows that singlet excitons are the primary excitations in mLPPP, as can be also inferred from the large exciton binding energy (0.5eV) obtained for this polymer [13].

Reference-contexts: We identify this process as due to intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet manifold, which occurs following exciton thermalization at times of order 1ns <ref> [17] </ref>, and hence its flat response with E for EE op . The other process, with an onset at E'3.2eV is therefore due to hot excitons and must thus occur very quickly.

Reference-contexts: One process is due to thermalized excitons and is thus independent of E, similar to P L (E). We identify this process as exciton dissociation (EX!e +h + !P +P + ) at impurities and defects in the film, similar to the "extrinsic" process observed in cw photoconductivity <ref> [18] </ref>. The second polaron photogeneration process is related to hot excitons and thus is probably intrinsic in nature showing a distinctive E dependence.
