Abstract: We exhibit a sequence c n such that the convergence of P n1 c n z n for jzj &lt; 1 is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. Numerical investigation of the c n revealed some astonishingly deceptive behavior. if &lt;(s) &gt; 1, and by analytic continuation for other complex s. (s) has a simple pole at s = 1, but is analytic everywhere else in the complex s plane. The "critical line" is &lt;(s) = 1=2. The "Riemann Hypothesis," which is one of the most important open problems in mathematics, is the conjecture that all of the zeroes of (s) in the region &lt;(s) 1=2 lie on the critical line. A tremendous amount of information about (s) and about various statements implied by, implying, or equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis, or about the known evidence and partial results on it, may be found in the references. Lo and behold, c 1 , ... c 25 are positive and strictly decreasing! Obviously, if these two facts were to continue forever, that would immediately imply the Riemann Hypothesis. And furthermore, notice that if you pick 25 random real numbers (e.g. from any probability density symmetric about zero) then the probability that by luck they are going to be positive and decreasing is 2 25 =25! 1:9 fi 10 33 . This is smaller than the probability that of picking a given air molecule from all the ones in the room. So, as any physicist could tell you (?), it must be the case. But, examining these 150 coefficients, I noticed that although not all of them are decreasing, still, all of them are positive. And the conjecture that all the c n are positive alone is enough to imply the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof is simple. Assume the RH is false, so some point of nonanalyticity of F (z) exists within the unit circle jzj &lt; 1. In that case, since the c n &gt; 0, it would be the case that there must be a singularity of F (z) actually on the real interval (0; 1). But, no such singularity exists (obvious from the definition of (s) for real s &gt; 1). QED. Now furthermore, if you pick 150 random numbers, the probability that they, by luck, are all going to be positive, is 2 150 7:0 fi 10 46 . OK, maybe 1:9 fi 10 33 was not small enough, but now, surely, we have enough confidence. This conjecture must be true, right? Visions of sugarplums danced in my head as I imagined ways to try to prove the c n are all positive. For example, one can write down various closed forms for the c n , and then try to prove them positive. fl NECI, 4 Independence way, Princeton NJ 08544
