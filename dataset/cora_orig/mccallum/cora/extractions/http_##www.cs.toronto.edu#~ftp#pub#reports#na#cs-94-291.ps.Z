Title: A Survey of the Explicit Runge-Kutta Method

Abstract: Research in explicit Runge-Kutta methods is producing continual improvements to the original algorithms, and the aim of this survey is to relate the current state-of-the-art. In drawing attention to recent advances, we hope to provide useful information for those who apply numerical methods. We describe recent work in the derivation of Runge-Kutta coefficients: "classical" general-purpose formulas, "special" formulas for high order and Hamiltonian problems, and "continuous" formulas for dense output. We also give a thorough review of implementation details. Modern techniques are described for the tasks of controlling the local error in a step-by-step integration, computing reliable estimates of the global error, detecting stiffness, and detecting and handling discontinuities and singularities. We also discuss some important software issues.
