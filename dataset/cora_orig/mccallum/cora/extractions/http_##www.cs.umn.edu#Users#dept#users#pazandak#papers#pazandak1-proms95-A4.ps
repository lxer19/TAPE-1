Title: The Temporal Language Component of DAMSEL An Embedable Event-Driven Declarative Multimedia Speciflcation Language

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the DAMSEL project, and the temporal language component of DAMSEL. The temporal component is one of three language components, and part of a framework being implemented at the University of Minnesota. DAMSEL is comprised of an embedable dynamic multimedia speciflcation language, and supporting execution environments. The goal of DAMSEL is to explore language constructs and execution environments for next-generation interactive multimedia applications. DAMSEL supports dynamic, event-driven speciflcations for the retrieval, presentation, modiflcation, analysis, and storage of multimedia data. Dynamic speciflcations enable system, application, and user-media interactions to afiect the run-time behavior. The temporal language component of DAMSEL contains two primitives for event-driven temporal speciflcation supporting causation and inhibition. Speciflcations require (extensible) behavioral parameters to be chosen, enabling very powerful temporal relations to be deflned. The other two components handle the modiflcation, analysis, presentation and storage of multimedia data. DAMSEL components support conditional and constraint logics, enabling more complex speciflcations than currently possible. DAMSEL also supports an open systems view, enabling current software to be used within it's architecture. keywords: multimedia, speciflcation language, synchronization, event-driven, run-time event manager, embedded language, event detection
