Abstract: In this paper, we use formal specification techniques to provide precompiled and provably correct domain-specific knowledge to autonomous agents. This allows for verifying agent interactions in the environment. In particular, we show that negotiating agents can resolve mutually incompatible local preferences and settle for an acceptable compromise by reasoning with formally specified default and exception behaviors. We use Swarm, a formal specification language, to characterize the preference of negotiating agents that are using a variation of the contract-net protocol. The framework is illustrated on an example from the service interaction problem in telecommunications systems. The combination of formal specification and negotiating agents is a multi-paradigm approach that we believe will provide comprehensive solutions to a variety of multi-agent coordination problems.

Reference-contexts: Once implemented, the system of agents can more reliably detect and resolve conflicting preferences or goals by using the formal specification. We have used formal specifications to characterize negotiation between contracting agents <ref> [5] </ref> by developing predicates and their constraints to represent a contracting framework, and then defining 1 safety and progress properties to instantiate appropriate domain-specific knowledge. <p> The actions of the negotiation are governed by safety and progress properties expressed over program states described by the predicates <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The contracting process is used to identify which of the available subcontractors (requirement and bid agents) will be involved in the final contract. This variation of contract net is similar to the one used by Sen <ref> [10] </ref> to schedule meetings between attendees, in which the attendees (i.e., contractors) to a meeting are known, and the contract net is used to identify a mutually acceptable meeting time.

Reference-contexts: The most widely known negotiation protocol based on contracting is the Contract Net <ref> [11] </ref>. The basic premise of this form of negotiation is that, if an agent cannot solve an assigned problem using local resources/expertise, it will decompose the problem into subproblems and try to find other willing agents with the necessary resources/expertise to solve these subproblems.

Reference-contexts: a gap between these research directions by providing a multi-paradigm solution to the service interaction problem that encompasses both a priori detection of service interactions and negotiation of solutions once the services are implemented. 2 Formal Specification for Negotiation Negotiation provides a useful metaphor for the coordination of autonomous agents <ref> [12] </ref>. The most widely known negotiation protocol based on contracting is the Contract Net [11].

Reference-contexts: This default operation leads to a conflict the between users' intentions when they subscribed to the features. One exception operation to resolve the conflict is to negotiate the delivery of alternative identifying information <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> An important distinction between our work and other DAI approaches to the service interaction problem is that local information is completely decoupled in that we do not rely on shared preference hierarchies <ref> [13] </ref>, etc. Communication between agents involves the exchange of requirements and bid specifications. This information can change locally (e.g., when a DN subscribes to a new service or cancels an old one) without necessitating any changes in the knowledge of other agents.
