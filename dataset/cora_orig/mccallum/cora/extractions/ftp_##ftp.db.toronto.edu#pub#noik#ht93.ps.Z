Title: Exploring Large Hyperdocuments: Fisheye Views of Nested Networks

Abstract: Browsing large hypertexts by following links can be difficult and confusing, especially if links span distant nodes. Often, a user would like to explore several regions of a network simultaneously, when studying the end points of one or more links, for example. Although this can be achieved by displaying each area of interest in a separate zoomed-in window, the union of such views is not always meaningful. In particular, valuable context showing the relationships between the views is lost. By balancing local detail and global context, fisheye views display information at several levels of abstraction simultaneously. We have devised a novel technique for generating fisheye views of hierarchically nested structures with multiple variable strength focal points. In this paper we demonstrate its feasibility as a tool for exploring large nested hypertext networks.

Reference-contexts: This technique was intended to complement text visualization tools not to replace them. Viewing the text associated with the leaves of the overview graph, can be accomplished by integrating a tool like lector with a graphical graph browser, as done in the Hy+ system, for example <ref> [3] </ref>. Although the flat graph of Figure 4 is not overly large by present-day standards, it is clear that a simple one-level overview is totally ineffective, both as a navigation aid, and as a means of displaying the structure of the document. <p> Several graphite components have been incorporated into existing systems, including G+/Hy+ [2] and 4Thought <ref> [3, 24] </ref>. 7 Future directions The application of our algorithm to nested hypertext networks suggests several directions for future research.

To reduce this problem, we applied the link inheritance technique <ref> [6] </ref> to reduce the number of visible links. The resulting graph shown in Figure 6 contains 1512 visible links. A more extreme decluttering approach is available through information hiding: the contents of selected nodes can be hidden, and revealed as necessary.

Reference-contexts: visualization technique. 3 Nested hyperdocuments 3.1 Nested graphs and networks Several nested graph and hypertext systems have been described in the literature; the following are some examples: Storyspace [1]; SemNet [5]; Interactive Graphical Documents (IGD) [6]; NoteCards [10]; state charts and higraphs [11]; the KJ method which employs compound digraphs <ref> [27, 28] </ref>; semantic knowledge networks [29]; and, Intermedia [32]. The NoteCards model of hypertext, for example, is built around four basic constructs: * Notecards. A notecard is an electronic generalization of the 3x5 paper notecard. Each card may contain some multi-media artifact such as text, graphics, image, sound, video.

Reference-contexts: Although their solution could be implemented efficiently using special purpose graphics hardware, it was limited to non-nested graphs with a single FP. Misue and Sugiyama described three distorting FEVs: fisheye, orthogonal fisheye, and biform [17]. These methods have been applied to drawings of compound digraphs <ref> [28] </ref> a nested graph formalism. The first two method employed distortions similar to Sarkar and Brown's, while the third used uniform scaling. Although these methods supported multiple equal strength FPs, they could not handle variable strength FPs. <p> visualization technique. 3 Nested hyperdocuments 3.1 Nested graphs and networks Several nested graph and hypertext systems have been described in the literature; the following are some examples: Storyspace [1]; SemNet [5]; Interactive Graphical Documents (IGD) [6]; NoteCards [10]; state charts and higraphs [11]; the KJ method which employs compound digraphs <ref> [27, 28] </ref>; semantic knowledge networks [29]; and, Intermedia [32].

Reference-contexts: This basic flaw was also noted in previous work [5, 25]. The layout-independent FEV technique outlined in this paper overcomes this limitation. 2.2 Other related work TreeMaps <ref> [13, 30] </ref> and Cone Trees [23] are two techniques for visualizing hierarchical structures that incorporate FEV concepts by using shape and size distortion and 3-D perspective respectively. Note that our FEV technique could be modified to calculate the sizes of the nested rectangles in TreeMaps.
