Reference-contexts: The pursuer is then launched at maximum thrust in the direction of the intercept point. If the evader fails to maneuver, the pursuer captures the evader at (or very close to) the intercept point. If the evader maneuvers, the pursuer relies upon the highly effective proportional navigation technique <ref> (Ball 1985) </ref> to pursue the evader.

Reference-contexts: For this study, the system incorporated physical data (including mass) and performance characteristics (such as maximum thrust, maximum turning rate, fuel consumption rate, and drag coefficients) of an F-16C aircraft evader (Lambert and Munson 1994) and various types of Soviet surface-to-air missile (SAM) pursuers <ref> (Cullen and Foss 1995) </ref>. Each best-of-run program was evolved using a training population of pursuers of a single SAM type, launched from a variety of potentially lethal positions. The resulting GP system was capable of evolving optimized programs that successfully evaded elements of the training population.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The two-dimensional pursuer/evader problem <ref> (Hamalainen and Ehtamo 1990) </ref> is a competitive zerosum game in which a faster, more agile pursuer is given a limited amount of time to capture an evader as both are traveling across a plane.

Reference-contexts: Prior Research (Moore and Garcia 1997) described a genetic programming <ref> (Koza 1992) </ref> solution to the E2DPE problem. During each generation of the genetic programming approach, each member of a population of programs for maneuvering the evader was trained against each member of a training population of pursuers. Each genetic programming run optimized maneuvers against a single type of pursuer.

Reference-contexts: A solution to the two-dimensional pursuer/evader problem must incorporate an optimized strategy for maneuvering the evader in a manner that successfully escapes the pursuer, regardless of the initial conditions of the system. <ref> (Moore and Garcia 1997) </ref> described a genetic programming (GP) solution to the extended two-dimensional pursuer/evader problem (E2DPE). <p> Prior Research <ref> (Moore and Garcia 1997) </ref> described a genetic programming (Koza 1992) solution to the E2DPE problem. During each generation of the genetic programming approach, each member of a population of programs for maneuvering the evader was trained against each member of a training population of pursuers. <p> For this study, the magnitude of the evaders velocity vector (its speed) at pursuer launch time was assumed to be the same for all encounters. Each fitness case corresponded to a specific combination of J and K. The research described in <ref> (Moore and Garcia 1997) </ref> identified a methodology for evolving optimized evasion strategies (in the form of programs) for a variety of pursuer populations. We began with the two-dimensional problem to reduce the required amount of computation as much as possible. <p> The best-of-run program represented an optimized evasion technique for a specific type of evader and a specific type of pursuer. The evader used in <ref> (Moore and Garcia 1997) </ref> was modeled using physical data and performance characteristics of an F-16C aircraft evader. Pursuers were modeled using physical data and performance characteristics of an SA-6, SA-13, or SA-15 surface-to-air missile (SAM) pursuer. <p> use of a training population reflecting a specific probability distribution over possible pursuer types help evolve programs that perform near-optimally against an unknown or uncertain type of pursuer? To begin to answer this question, a new set of fifteen best-of-run programs were evolved under conditions analogous to those described in <ref> (Moore and Garcia 1997) </ref>. Instead of using a training population consisting of a single type of pursuer, however, the new set of programs were evolved against pursuers that were equally likely to be an SA-6, SA-13, or SA-15.

Reference-contexts: The optimal strategy for the evader is to maneuver in a manner that maximizes the likelihood of evading the pursuer, regardless of the initial state of the evader and the relative launch position of the pursuer <ref> (Zarchan 1990) </ref>. Note that by rotating the reference coordinate system at the launch site of the pursuer, the initial pursuer/evader line-of-sight angle l 0 may be considered constant for all pursuer/evader pairs.
