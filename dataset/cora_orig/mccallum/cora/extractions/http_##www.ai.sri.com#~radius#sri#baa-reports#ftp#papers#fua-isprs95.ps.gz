Title: Parametric Models are Versatile: The Case of Model Based Optimization  
Author: P. Fua 
Address: 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, California 94025  
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International  
Abstract: Model-Based Optimization (MBO) is a paradigm in which an objective function is used to express both geometric and photometric constraints on features of interest. A parametric model of a feature (such as a road, a building, or coastline) is extracted from one or more images by adjusting the model's state variables until a minimum value of the objective function is obtained. The optimization procedure yields a description that simultaneously satisfies (or nearly satisfies) all constraints, and, as a result, is likely to be a good model of the feature.

Reference-contexts: In practice, we take E D to be a measure of the curvature or local deviation from a plane at every vertex. Because the mesh is regular, E D can be approximated using finite differences as a quadratic form <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1995a ] </ref> E D (S) = 1=2 (X T KX + Y T KY + Z T KZ) ; (19) where X,Y , and Z are the vectors of the x,y and z coordinates of the vertices, and K is a sparse and banded matrix.

Reference-contexts: Given the fact that the control points are not necessarily perfect themselves, this is the kind of performance one would expect of a precise stereo system [ Guelch, 1988 ] . Furthermore, at higher resolutions, we have also shown <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1995b ] </ref> , that our approach can also take advantage of the geometric constraints derived from measured 3-D points and 2-D silhouettes, thereby making the reconstruction more robust. 4 Conclusion We have presented object modeling techniques for 2-D and 3-D linear features as well as 3-D surfaces

Reference-contexts: We overcome this limitation by improving upon a method to deal with discontinuities in albedo alluded to in the summary of <ref> [ Leclerc and Bobick, 1991 ] </ref> . We compute the albedo at each facet using the normal to the facet, a light-source direction, and the average of the intensities projected onto the facet from all images.

Reference-contexts: It accommodates such viewpoint-dependent effects as self-occlusion and self-shadowing. * Our technique for doing stereo avoids the constant depth assumption of traditional correlation-based stereo algorithms. As the Hierarchical Warp Stereo System <ref> [ Quam, 1984 ] </ref> , it effectively uses variable sized windows in the images but does it in a more generic fashion. * Our approach to shape from shading is applicable to surfaces with slowly varying albedo.
