Reference-contexts: Another extension concerns the introduction of constraints to improve the specification of integrity and compatibility conditions 1 . Their construction in the dynamic knowledge base is triggered in a way very similar to the conceptual constraints in PLAKON <ref> [Cunis et al., 1991] </ref>. The problem of conflicting requirements has lead to an additional "interactive" configuration mode. Stock data can be used to test the availability of the current configuration. The system tries to display conflicting selections to the user.

Reference-contexts: The importance of an optional requirement is in contrast obviously determined with reference to the other requirements because importance is intended to control conflict resolvation. Unless cash prices there is no global preference scale to distinguish the merits of requirements. Nevertheless, prioritized respectively fuzzy constraints <ref> [Dubois and Prade, 1992] </ref> have been praised as declarative representations of optional requirement specifications in configuration systems. This claim contradicts even another intuitive demand. One generally expects that a compliance with more requirements is preferred.

Reference-contexts: It is certainly a task of the configuration system to avoid conflicts, because retracting design decisions is very difficult and time consuming. Time and patience of the expert can be expected to be rather rare and expensive. In contrast to well known investigations of this problem <ref> [Gunter, 1993] </ref>, not the pruning of the search for a solution is the most important problem but the pruning of search for a satisfiable problem specification. Consequently, prospective inference like consistency processing of constraints is becoming more and more important in configuration.

Reference-contexts: Adopted repair strategies are needed to compute a solution of reasonable quality. As another example consider structure-oriented configuration enriched by global constraints being well known from the scheduling context. All resource-oriented configuration problems <ref> [Heinrich, 1993] </ref> can be specified in such a language. However, for the latter problems an effective problem solving procedure is known. Thus, transformation into resource-oriented configuration is recommended whenever possible 5 . The third question concerns the handling of preferences and believe.

Reference-contexts: Amazingly, management of more or less preferred requirements has hardly been explored in detail, yet. Most of the approaches mentioned 3 For example the ILOG-Solver as the most common constraint solver offers the opportunity to set choice points explicitly in tree search algorithms like the branch&bound <ref> [ILOG, 1996] </ref>. 4 The applied algorithms have not yet been published. Nevertheless, the overall procedure has been described within another context [Meyer auf'm Hofe, 1996a]. 5 This has been the reason for Holger Wache to integrate the balance operation of resource-oriented configuration into the TooCon system [Wache and Abecker, 1996].

Reference-contexts: The same kind of soft constraints has been beneficially applied to represent properties of presumably good solutions of the problem. Prospective processing of such constraints has been exploited to inform branch&bound search about the most promising assignments being probably part of a sufficient solution <ref> [Meyer auf'm Hofe and Tschaitschian, 1995] </ref>. But even this improved tree-search algorithm failed to compute acceptable solutions for many relevant problems within a reasonable amount of time. Consequently, repair-based mechanisms had to be developed to improve tree-search results.

Reference-contexts: However, the actual goal is to obtain as important decisions as possible. * Prospective inference aims at avoiding conflicting specifications. Often for example in systems like IDAX constraint propagation is used to prune choice points being in conflict with previous decisions <ref> [Meyer auf'm Hofe, 1994] </ref>. Thus, this technique is only applicable if the most important decisions are made early or later choices depend highly on earlier decisions.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the overall procedure has been described within another context <ref> [Meyer auf'm Hofe, 1996a] </ref>. 5 This has been the reason for Holger Wache to integrate the balance operation of resource-oriented configuration into the TooCon system [Wache and Abecker, 1996]. Harald Meyer auf'm Hofe: What Is Still To Do. . . <p> In fact, user input is used to improve the configuration system. A really satisfying configuration system will inversely be designed to improve the user's abilities. An outcome of the KoALa problem analysis has been a system design that aims at avoiding these disadvantages employing soft constraints <ref> [Meyer auf'm Hofe, 1996a] </ref>. All requirements specified by the user are represented by soft constraints. Thus, the system is able to compute a solution complying with the given requirements as good as possible. Then, this preliminary result may serve as a hint to improve the problem specification adding new constraints.

Reference-contexts: Using prioritized constraints (or fuzzy constraint ) this is not necessarily the case. All solutions consistent with the most important constraints are considered to be of equal merit. More promising seems to be an approach based upon a partial ordering O of all sets of requirements <ref> [Meyer auf'm Hofe, 1996b] </ref>. The searching algorithm tries to find a solution that is consistent with one of the O-largest satisfiable sets of constraints. However, specifying such preferences by pairs of sets of requirements to represent any intended strategy of conflict resolvation explicitly is too complicated.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, repair-based mechanisms had to be developed to improve tree-search results. The algorithm searchs for a Pareto optimum that is good enough to be accepted as an answer of the system 4 <ref> [Minton et al., 1992] </ref>. Pareto optima of the nurse scheduling problem are of rather different absolute quality. First approaches of generic repair heuristics have not been able to do their job sufficiently. Therefore, the current version of the system incorporates problem specific repair strategies. <p> One tries to inform search as good as possible about consequences of searching steps. This procedure requires to put large effort on acquiring such control knowledge without guarantee, that it will work (as the ConPlan example shows). 3. One applies local or heuristic search procedures <ref> [Minton et al., 1992, Wallace and Freuder, 1995] </ref>. Applied to optimization problems such procedures do not guarantee optimality according to the problem specification. One even does not know how good the returned solution is compared to the optimal one.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, prospective inference like consistency processing of constraints is becoming more and more important in configuration. Such techniques even enter backtracking oriented systems with TMS-based inference <ref> [Petrie et al., 1996] </ref> in order to combine advantages from both approaches: * The justifications maintained by a TMS are often told to be valuable information when resolving conflicts.

Reference-contexts: This is not intended to be a technical paper. Thus, the approaches are sketched superficially. Finally, potentials for further research are mentioned from the author's perspective. 2.1 Product configuration within R/3 This section points out aims and abilities of the product configuration within the R/3-system <ref> [SAP AG, 1996] </ref>. The system is roughly spoken a programming environment specialized on relatively simple configuration tasks. The product data base of a company comprising all objects to be bought or sold is possibly very large.
