Abstract: In Internet multicast, the set of receivers can be dynamic with receivers joining and leaving a group asynchronously and without the knowledge of the source(s). Multicast scoping is one of the methods by which the propagation of multicast packets is controlled in such a dynamic environment. The Internet today uses source-based scoping by which the source determines how far its multicast transmissions will propagate. In this paper we explore the use of receiver-based scoping. In such a scheme a receiver's join request is augmented with one or more scope values. By use of these values, the receiver specifies its wish to join and remain in the multicast group as long as its share of resource usage is within its declared scope. Receiver-based scoping can be used to more directly control an individual multicast receiver's share of the resources used in a multicast session. The paper is concerned with discussion of the design of the receiver-based scoping mechanism and its possible use within multicast applications. We also consider the implementation of the mechanism as an extension to the existing Internet multicast infrastructure and evaluate its use in the context of current MBone sessions.

Reference-contexts: Multicast packets are addressed to a group address.

A multicast routing protocol operating within the network ensures the delivery of multicast packets to joining receivers. Multicast scoping is one of the methods by which the propagation of multicast packets is controlled in such a dynamic environment.

Reference-contexts: Routers decrement this counter and forward the packet only if the decremented counter value is larger than an administratively configured threshold. Forwarded multicast packets in this case contain the decremented value of the counter. Another more recently proposed technique relies on administrative scoping rather than TTL scoping <ref> [4] </ref> with essentially the same effect of limiting the propagation of multicast packets to within a defined region around the source. Because the source cannot control which receivers join a multicast group, scoping is the only multicast propagation (and hence multicast session cost) control method available to the source.

Reference-contexts: We also consider the implementation of the mechanism as an extension to the existing Internet multicast infrastructure and evaluate its use in the context of current MBone sessions. Multicast scoping in the Internet works in conjunction with multicast routing protocols that route the multicast packet over a tree <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. In modern multicast routing protocols, the tree grows and shrinks to span the dynamic set of receivers. A path to a new receiver is grafted onto the tree whereas an existing path in the tree is pruned once it is no longer used to reach receivers. <p> Their are two basic flavors of multicast routing protocols, ones 1 that use a shared tree to deliver multicast packets from all sources <ref> [5] </ref>, and ones which use a separate routing tree per multicast source [6, 8]. Some routing protocols allow a hybrid approach [7]. All such protocols use some form of grafting and pruning of paths in order to accommodate dynamic group membership.

Reference-contexts: The issue of cost allocation among multicast receivers and of pricing multicast sessions is a complex one and is outside the scope of this paper. For an excellent treatment of one aspect of this topic see <ref> [9] </ref>. We argue, however, that the receiver-based scoping mechanism is an important tool that can be used in determining cost allocation and pricing strategies.

Reference-contexts: One possible scenario would allow a combination of push and pull delivery at a server. The server would multicast frequently requested information repetitively and would in addition accept requests for information in the normal transaction-oriented way <ref> [14] </ref>. A client will then have the option of receiving information via multicast or making an explicit request from the server for unicast delivery.
