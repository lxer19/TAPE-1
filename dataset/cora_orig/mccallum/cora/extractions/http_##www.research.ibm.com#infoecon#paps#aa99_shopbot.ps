Abstract: Shopbots are programs that automatically search the Internet for information that pertains to the price and quality of goods or services on behalf of consumers. This paper addresses the economic implications of the widespread utilization of shopbots, as shopbots are viewed as an increasingly essential component of electronic commerce. The research described herein includes the proposal, analysis, and simulation of a simple economic model which captures some of the essence of shopbots, in an attempt to shed light on their potential impact on markets. In particular, a variety of adaptive, price-setting algorithms are considered which firms or agents might implement to maximize their profits in the face of a growing community of shopbots. Overall, this study should provide new insights on the impact of agent and information technology on the nascent information economy.

Reference-contexts: In this case, prices are driven down to marginal cost; in particular, p fl s = c, for all sellers s. (For an explanation of this phenomenon, see, for example, Tirole <ref> [18] </ref>). In contrast, consider the case in which all buyers are of type A, meaning that they randomly select a potential seller: i.e., w A = 1 and w B = 0. <p> It therefore seems somewhat remarkable that they tend towards what is in effect a collusive state in which all sellers charge nearly the monopolistic price. This is "tacit collusion" as defined, for example, in Tirole <ref> [18] </ref>, since the agents are not communicating at all and there is consequently nothing illegal about their behavior. By exhibiting this behavior, DF sellers accumulate greater profits than in any of the cases examined thus far.
