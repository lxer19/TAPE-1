Abstract: Authenticating the source of a message in a large distributed system can be difficult due to the lack of a single authority that can tell for whom a channel speaks. This has lead many to propose the use of a path of authorities, each able to authenticate the next, such that the first authority in the path can be authenticated by the message recipient and the last authority in the path can authenticate the message source. In this paper we suggest the use of multiple such paths, no two of which share a common authority, to provide independent confirmation of the message source. We formalize the problem of finding a maximum set of such paths of bounded length in a graph-theoretic framework, in which the problem can be seen to be NP-hard. We propose approximation algorithms for this problem and evaluate their accuracy on a graph induced by a database of PGP certificates. We also introduce the PathServer for PGP, a service for finding maximum sets of such paths to support authentication in PGP-based applications.

Reference-contexts: Much of this work has focused on assigning numerical measures of trustworthiness to paths or collections of paths (e.g., <ref> [TH92, BBK94] </ref>). These efforts have recognized that shorter paths and multiple paths lend additional credibility to the authentication of a channel, and the derived numerical measures tend to reflect these observations.

Reference-contexts: Our PathServer service highlights both of these goals. Since its introduction on July 24, 1996, PathServer has influenced other research efforts dealing with authentication in large-scale systems. For example, as a result of our work, the Policy-Maker <ref> [BFL96] </ref> implementation in Premail [LMB96] has added support for verifying that a given set of paths satisfy disjointedness and maximum length requirements, and thus Premail is an example of an application that could effectively make use of PathServer output.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding a maximum set of disjoint paths, each of at most a given length, can be modeled in a graph-theoretic framework in which it has been proved to be NP-hard <ref> [GJ79] </ref>. Moreover, the foremost practical instance of the disjoint paths problem that we consider induces a graph of sufficient size to make this a severe limitation. We thus settle for efficient heuristics to approximate the maximum set of disjoint paths. <p> BDP has been previously studied from a complexity-theoretic point of view, and has been proved to be NP-hard (see <ref> [GJ79, p. 217] </ref>). Thus, there is little hope of finding an efficient solution to BDP, and we turn to finding approximation algorithms for this problem. <p> By an "approximation algorithm," we intuitively mean an efficient algorithm that usually comes close to the actual answer; a more careful definition and discussion can be found in <ref> [GJ79] </ref>. Because of the application domain, we demand that our algorithms be fail-secure, in the sense that they will never return a set of paths from a source channel s to a target channel t that exaggerates the actual maximum set of disjoint paths from s to t. <p> This algorithm nevertheless can be argued to be "efficient" for two reasons. First, if P 6= NP, then there is no algorithm for solving BDP exactly that is polynomial in n, since BDP remains NP-hard for any fixed b &gt; 4 <ref> [GJ79, p. 217] </ref>. <p> Any set V 0 V such that no two vertices in V 0 are joined is said to be an independent set. Such a set V 0 of largest cardinality is said to be a maximum independent set. MIS is a well-known NP-hard problem; see <ref> [GJ79] </ref>. In [Joh74], Johnson presented a simple approximation algorithm for this problem.

Reference-contexts: In a distributed system there typically is no such central authority for this information. As the distributed system gets larger and more diverse, the difficulty of reliably authenticating a channel can increase substantially. This difficulty is exemplified in secure electronic mail systems such as PEM <ref> [Ken93] </ref> and a number of commercial systems based on the PGP [Zim95] public key management and encryption tools. An e-mail message in these systems would typically contain a digital signature that is intended to enable the recipient of the message to determine the user who sent the message.

Reference-contexts: An e-mail message in these systems would typically contain a digital signature that is intended to enable the recipient of the message to determine the user who sent the message. Following <ref> [LABW92] </ref>, the channel in this case is the public key that can be used to verify the signature on the message, and authenticating the channel means determining the principals that could have generated that signature. <p> If the user is willing to trust the statements of each channel on the path, then the user authenticates c k according to the statement that c k1 made about c k . Such approaches have also been promoted in <ref> [BLNS86, GLP92, LABW92, YKB94, Stu95] </ref>. Relying on a single path of channels can be unreliable since it assumes trust in all intermediate channels on the path, and a single instance of misplaced trust can result in a false authentication of the target channel. <p> Though PathServer currently supports only PGP, our work can also be applied to other public key management systems (e.g., those based on X.509) as well as to systems that employ other types of channels (e.g., shared keys, protected physical links, or a combination of these <ref> [LABW92] </ref>). The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 by relating our problem area to prior work. We formalize the problem of finding a maximum set of bounded-length disjoint paths in Section 3. <p> Prior work on locating paths of channels typically focuses on finding a single path to a channel, and either assumes a known "topology" regarding what channels could make statements about others <ref> [BLNS86, GLP92, LABW92] </ref> or exhibits exponential worst-case complexity as a function of the number of channels [TH92, YKB93, YKB94]. <p> We are currently adding the necessary interfaces to PathServer to make this possible. 3 Problem statement In formalizing our problem, we borrow concepts and terminology from <ref> [LABW92] </ref>. Our system consists of a set of principals (e.g., people, machines, roles), some of which are channels (e.g., network addresses or encryption keys). Channels are the only principals that can make statements directly.

In this context, our multiple sources of information are multiple paths resulting in statements about the target channel. Independence of these sources of information is achieved by requiring these paths to be disjoint, i.e., to share no intermediate channels.

Reference-contexts: Our work can be viewed as a new instantiation of this paradigm. 3 In the context of PGP, there have recently been efforts to gather statistics about the graph of channels (public keys) induced by PGP certificates worldwide <ref> [McB96] </ref>. This work focuses on characterizing the structure of the graph, and in particular identifying strongly-connected components of this graph, determining mean and maximum shortest path distances between channels, and identifying channels in the graph that are central to its connectivity. <p> Since the characteristics of such graphs are yet to be conclusively identified, however, even generating such test graphs remains an open problem. We hope that work such as <ref> [McB96] </ref> will shed light on this issue. 12 6 Conclusion and future work In this paper we have introduced bounded disjoint paths as a tool for supporting high-assurance authentication in large distributed systems.

In addition to the above properties, each algorithm uses heuristics to search for a maximum set of paths. In Section 5.3, we give emperical evidence that our algorithms perform well on one type of interesting graph.
