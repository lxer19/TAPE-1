The dominant providers of word processors (e.g. Microsoft WORD [4] and Novell WORDPerfect [5]), have often provided tools to allow the import of others standards, but have done little to promote easy interoperability of their documents with those of others. <p> have been many attempts to introduce such standards in electronic text processing and information interchange; three examples are the Office Document Architecture (ODA; ISO 8613) activities [1], those towards a Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML) [2], and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) <ref> [3] </ref>, used in the World Wide Web (WWW) [3]. The dominant providers of word processors (e.g. Microsoft WORD [4] and Novell WORDPerfect [5]), have often provided tools to allow the import of others standards, but have done little to promote easy interoperability of their documents with those of others. <p> An online database of Electronic Documents offers many advantages over the conventional paper-based Documents; many of these advantages fall into the areas of search and access. Searching texts electronically is much easier than manually. The Word Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [3] </ref> is the largest information service on the Internet - and probably in the world. WWW is a clientserver system with both clients and servers throughout the world. A WWW server is a program running on a computer that listens on a TCP port for incoming connections from WWW clients. <p> A WWW server is a program running on a computer that listens on a TCP port for incoming connections from WWW clients. It expects a connecting client to speak in a protocol called Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <ref> [3] </ref>. The documents in the WWW are written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) format, and delivered from WWW servers to the Clients in this form. The technology in the WWW is evolving incredibly rapidly; many more proprietary format to HTML converters are available already, and many more are coming.

It also looked at different Public Domain versions of converters which are available for converting SGML, ODA, and RTF to HTML. Finally, the report discussed the commercial package of WAIS <ref> [12] </ref> and WAISgate for creating a searchable document database which can be retrieved using WWW clients. In its second deliverable [28], UCL studied both public and commercial packages for storage and retrieval systems, and WWW gateways for retrieving documents from the database.

Reference-contexts: The DMU work consisted of identifying known format conversion techniques and establishing methods by which popular word processing formats can be converted to SGML and related style sheet formats for presentation. It was hoped to utilise the Document Style Semantics Specification Language (DSSSL) Lite standard <ref> [13] </ref>, but delays in its release and its limited support by computer software manufacturers have prevented this. In order to demonstrate the concepts of word-processing conversion to SGML the project has chosen the style sheet language of Panorama from SoftQuad [14].

Reference-contexts: In order to demonstrate the concepts of word-processing conversion to SGML the project has chosen the style sheet language of Panorama from SoftQuad <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> DMU has concentrated on studying how SGML documents can be generated easily from within popular text processing environments. They have studied the following DTDs :- HTML 3.0 [16], Rainbow 2.5 [17], TEI Lite [18]. Using these DTDs, suitable style sheets have been developed for use with SoftQuad's Panorama PRO <ref> [14] </ref>. DMU has investigated the suitability of the above DTDs for electronic document interchange. In [19], DMU considered the numerous document converters that are available within the public domain.

Reference-contexts: DMU has identified methods for users to reach this goal. To this aim, the work done by groups UKERNA, Deliverable 3 UCL-JEDI V2.2 9 such as the Text Encoding Initiative and Electronic Book Technologies <ref> [15] </ref> is of immense value. It is also encouraging to note that Novell WORDPerfect have recently brought out WORDPerfect 6.1, SGML Edition. First indications are that this product is very good. Microsoft have not yet brought out an SGML version for Word although one has been promised.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the report discussed the commercial package of WAIS [12] and WAISgate for creating a searchable document database which can be retrieved using WWW clients. In its second deliverable <ref> [28] </ref>, UCL studied both public and commercial packages for storage and retrieval systems, and WWW gateways for retrieving documents from the database. Both public and commercial database and gateways have been set up at UCL as servers. <p> For document transfer, UCL has set up a Mail system with MIME body parts of different formats viz. SGML, ODA, HTML, RTF and LaTeX. Documents can be retrieved in its original or converted format via mail messages. The deliverable <ref> [28] </ref> also includes a specification for setting up an Automatic Mail System for the originator of the document to store the proprietary format in the database or to request a conversion procedure.

Reference-contexts: The deliverable [28] also includes a specification for setting up an Automatic Mail System for the originator of the document to store the proprietary format in the database or to request a conversion procedure. The full description of the AMS is given in its third Deliverable <ref> [29] </ref>, though supplementary information is given in [30]. The Automatic Mail System (AMS) is a simple system which acts as an automated UKERNA, Deliverable 3 UCL-JEDI V2.2 10 testing and storage tool for different format documents. <p> Its sole task is to periodically look for new messages. If there are any, it takes the message and checks whether the message is a Request Message. A message is a Request Message if it specifies any one of the commands listed in <ref> [29] </ref> in the Subject field. If the message is a UKERNA, Deliverable 3 UCL-JEDI V2.2 11 Request Message, the processor performs the appropriate command specified, generates a Response Message and finally moves the Request Message to the appropriate folder, to be acted upon by the processor. <p> For the automatic conversion UCL could have modified its SGML&gt;ODA converters to work with the DTD produced by DMU; in practice this was not done because of the lack of interest in ODA. With the release of this Deliverable <ref> [29] </ref>, UCL completed the developments planned for the JEDI project. We continue, however, to support continued use of the UCL package until at least the end of September 1996; UCL-CS will run a Server containing the AMS until that date which will be accessible to the UK research community.
