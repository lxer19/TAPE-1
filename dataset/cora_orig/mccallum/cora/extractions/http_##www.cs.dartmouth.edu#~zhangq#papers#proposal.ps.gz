Reference-contexts: Document images contain patterns such as characters and lines, which may be repeated many times. Pattern matching coding techniques exploit these macroscopic properties of document images. These techniques were originally proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> and further studied in [5], [4], and [7]. Image compression based on pattern matching works in this way: patterns, connected blobs of ink, which are expected to be characters, are extracted from the image to be compressed. These patterns are compared to previously transmitted patterns.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if two different patterns are accepted as matched, the reconstructed image will have different text from the original image. This is unacceptable for most document image compression applications. A number of pattern matching algorithms were proposed in [5], [6], and <ref> [2] </ref>. Most algorithms are based on analysis of the error map, which is the logical exclusive-or of the two images.

For example, CDIS looks for a four error pixels clustered in a square, and rejects a match if such pattern is found. These rules are based on heuristic.

These patterns are compared to previously transmitted patterns. <p> In a long document, pattern indices and positions make up the majority of the code space, so it is important to code them compactly. Previous document image compression systems do not compress pattern positions well. Witten et al.'s TIC <ref> [7] </ref>, the best previous system, spends more bits on pattern positions than on pattern indices, roughly 10 bits per character. TIC codes the offset between one pattern and the next exactly. The offsets are coded using a first-order predictive model based on the pattern index.

Reference-contexts: Then we use eq. 1 to calculate the cross-entropy between one pattern and another. We compare the performance of EPM with CTM and CSIS, which are considered the best previous pattern matching methods. EPM outperforms both of the methods. <ref> [9] </ref> has a complete description of EPM. 2.2 Lossy Pattern Instance Position Coding A typical pattern-based image compression system encodes an image in three components: * The pattern library: a set of small bitmap patterns. * A pattern index sequence representing the text in the image. * The position of each

Reference-contexts: There are no visible artifacts in the reconstructed image due to this reduction in precision. The overall compression ration measured with this technique was 69:1 which is 13% better than the best previous results. <ref> [10] </ref> is a full report of this result. 3 Future Work I will focus my future thesis work on improving pattern matching techniques and compression performance.
