Abstract: The algorithm is based on Mean Field Theory (MFT). MFT has recently been shown to be a powerful optimization technique. It has a very similar architecture to a Hopfield neural network, but is considerably more effective. We also show how the computational complexity can be substantially improved by a hashing scheme. This combination of geometric hashing with MFT is likely to be applicable to many other recognition and labelling problems.

Reference-contexts: In a single view the object is only partly imaged and the image may contain measurements of other objects. Of course the "model" may be the data from another view. For a discussion on free-form surface matching see Besl's survey article (1992). Recent work on matching free-form surfaces includes <ref> (Bergevin et al., 1995) </ref> and (Hebert et al., 1995). We should note that although our method does not make restrictive assumptions such as convexity or the absence of clutter it is not well suited to surfaces consisting largely of a few planes, cylinders or spheres.

Reference-contexts: Also, the points on a surface cannot be ordered as they can in the case of a curve. The task of finding an accurate registration is usually handled by the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm <ref> (Besl and McKay, 1992) </ref>. This method finds the nearest local minimum of a cost function formulated in pose space. This means that the user must supply an initial guess reasonably close to the global minimum. This paper presents a method that could automatically supply this guess.

Reference-contexts: There are no restrictions on the topology. There may be holes, discontinuities or clutter. We do require some `reasonable' amount of overlap between scene and model. In related work we have explored use of Genetic Algorithms in place of MFT <ref> (Brunnstrom and Stoddart, 1995, 1996) </ref> 2 Free-Form Surface Matching Peterson and Soderberg (1989) have introduced a new and powerful type of neural net based on Mean Field theory (MFT).

Reference-contexts: The final dataset that we will consider is the soldier. This consists of two overlapping views of a toy soldier each consisting of about 20000 triangles. In figure 4 (a) and (b) we show a reconstruction of the entire soldier performed from several views by <ref> (Hilton et al., 1996) </ref>. In figures (c) and (d) we show two overlapping views of the soldier that we will try and match. In figure (e) we show one of the matches with accuracy of about 3 degrees. The mismatch is visible when comparing the helmet with figure (f).

Reference-contexts: Finally the labelling ~ff needs to be processed further to produce the required pose estimate. Our procedure is simply to choose the k objects with lowest energy. These give us k point correspondences and we then use a conventional least-squares fit to obtain the pose <ref> (Kanatani, 1994) </ref>. 2.3 Complexity What is the complexity of this basic method? If the label weights r are updated over i iterations then the complexity will be O (iN 2 M 2 ).
