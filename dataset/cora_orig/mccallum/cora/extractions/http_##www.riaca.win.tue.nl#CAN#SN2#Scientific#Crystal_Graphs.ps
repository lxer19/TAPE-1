Abstract: We use the theory of crystal graphs to give a simple graph-theoretical algorithm for determining the branching rule for decomposing a representation of a simple Lie algebra when restricted to a simple subalgebra. We also describe a computer package for determining such decompositions graphically. When modeling elementary particle interactions and symmetry breaking in physics it becomes important to understand how tensor products of representations of simple Lie algebras decompose into irreducible sub-representations and how irreducible representations decompose when restricted to simple subalgebras. The classification of irreducible finite dimensional representations of simple Lie algebras is well-understood ([2]). In principal, this classification yields straightforward, if cumbersome, algorithms for decomposing The purpose of this paper is to present simpler algorithms for solving these problems using crystal graphs ([5]). We, further, describe an implementation of these algorithms in a Maple package ([3],[4]).
