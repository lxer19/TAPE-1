Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of predicting the quasistatic planar motion of a passive rigid body in frictional contact with a set of active rigid bodies. The active bodies can be thought of as the links of a mechanism or robot manipulator whose positions can be actively controlled by actuators. The passive body can be viewed as a "grasped" object, which moves only in response to contact forces and other external forces such as those due to gravity. We formulate this problem as a certain uncoupled complementarity problem, and show that it belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Finally, numerical results of our proposed linear programming-based solution algorithm for this class of problems are presented and compared to the only other currently available solution algorithm. y The research of this author was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-9304734, the Texas Advanced Technology Program under grant 999903-095, and the Texas Advanced Research Program under grant 999903-078.

Reference-contexts: Besides the quasistatic contact problem, the problem of determining whether two disjoint point sets in R n can be separated by two planes can also be formulated as an uncoupled complementarity problem <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition, the zero-one integer feasibility problem is also a special instance of the UCP; consequently, the uncoupled complementarity problem belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Proposition 2 The uncoupled complementarity problem with integral data is NP-complete. Proof. The UCP clearly belongs to the class NP. <p> Incidentally, in the article <ref> [1] </ref>, Bennett and Mangasarian have described a variation of Step 1 to compute a stationary point of an uncoupled bilinear program (of which the UCP is a special case).

Reference-contexts: Our improved understanding comes as a result of the three main contributions of this paper. First, a new complementarity formulation of the quasistatic contact problem is introduced, which we refer to as the uncoupled complementarity problem (UCP) in order to distinguish it from the standard linear complementarity problem <ref> [2] </ref>. Second, it is established that the UCP lies in the class of NP-complete problems. Finally, we develop a linear programming-based algorithm for solving the UCP. The application of this algorithm to the quasistatic contact problem is discussed and numerical results are reported. <p> The contact conditions (8), (9), and (10) naturally lead one to suspect that this contact problem can be formulated as a complementarity problem. As we shall see below, this is 6 indeed the case; nevertheless, the resulting complementarity problem is not of the standard type as discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> the orthogonality condition x T y = 0 if and only if the standard complementarity relation holds: x i y i = 0; i = 1; : : : ; n: The well-known linear complementarity problem (LCP) is to find a vector z 2 R n satisfying the following constraints <ref> [2] </ref>: w = q + M z 0; z 0; w T z = 0; where q 2 R n and M 2 R nfin are given. The LCP is coupled.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, a pair (x; y) solves the UCP if and only if (x; y) is a globally optimal solution of (13) with a zero objective value. Thus, the UCP can be solved by finding a globally optimal solution to the bilinear program (13). Section 1 in Chapter 9 of <ref> [4] </ref> contains a rather extensive treatment of a bilinear program; in particular, some basic properties and various algorithmic approaches for computing a solution are discussed.

Reference-contexts: With these inputs, we generated the data for the polyhedra X and Y as described in Section 3. The algorithm was coded in C and a self-written code for the simplex method (with some linear algebraic subroutines taken from <ref> [7] </ref>) was used to solve (to optimality) the various linear programs (14) and (15). The experiments were conducted on a Sun SPARCStation IPX with 16 megabytes of memory and one CPU processor.

In several recent articles <ref> [9, 10, 11] </ref>, a new approach based on the mechanics of quasistatic multi-rigid-body systems has been proposed. <p> Finally, we develop a linear programming-based algorithm for solving the UCP. The application of this algorithm to the quasistatic contact problem is discussed and numerical results are reported. We show that our proposed algorithm is capable of finding a solution much more quickly than the only other existing algorithm <ref> [11] </ref>. In fact, the other algorithm is enumerative, requiring the evaluation of a number of potential solutions, which grows exponentially with the number of contacts. <p> For in-depth discussions of the advantages of the quasistatic multi-rigid-body contact model over its dynamic counterpart and of previous related work, we refer the reader to <ref> [11] </ref>. A body of arbitrary shape (the object or workpiece) moves quasistatically due to frictional contact with one or more actively-controlled bodies (see Figure 1). The actively-controlled bodies are viewed as the links of a manipulator composed of any number of serial and branching kinematic chains. <p> Since we are more interested in the performance of the algorithm than in the actual output, we choose to report only the former and omit the latter. We initially tested our code with three sets of data drawn from <ref> [11] </ref> (denoted Data Set 1,2 and 3 below). We successfully solved all of them with x T y = 0 by finding no more than two (x; y) pairs (a total of 6 linear programs, including the two initial ones) before arriving at the complementary solution. <p> We then further tested our code with fifty six different combinations of f i g in Data Set 2. The results we obtained were consistent with those presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. Forty one of them were solved by exploring no more than two pairs of (x; y). Three other sets of data invoked Step 3 once which successfully identified the complementary solution from the adjacent extreme points of the current (x; y) pair. <p> At this time we are not certain whether the four unsolved problems actually have a solution (although we suspect that problem 17 might). Overall, the algorithm has been rather successful in solving the quasistatic multi-rigid-body contact problem with Coulomb friction. The other existing algorithm for solving this problem <ref> [11] </ref> is an enumerative scheme that tests certain candidate solutions (potentially many) which satisfy some constraints derived from practical engineering concerns. This enumerative scheme has been applied only to simple cases with very small numbers of contacts.
