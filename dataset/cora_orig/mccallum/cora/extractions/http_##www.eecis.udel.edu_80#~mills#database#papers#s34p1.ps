Title: On the Long-range Dependence of Packet Round-trip Delays in Internet  
Author: Qiong Li David L. Mills 
Affiliation: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware  
Abstract: Many recent studies on network traffic demonstrate that Long-range Dependence (LRD) is a ubiquitous property of traffic both in a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN). So the performance of network should be dominated by this property. Packet Round-trip Delay is an important measurement of network performance. In this paper, we present evidence that LRD exists in packet round-trip delays. This discovery has serious implications for understanding the impact on network performance of LRD network traffic, and design of transport control protocols for special applications, i.e., of teleconferencing. Statistical analyses show that the complementary probability distribution of packet round-trip delays decays more slowly than exponential rate; this fact probably justifies the studies on the prediction of the queue length distribution with LRD network traffic. We also tentatively use a multi-queueing system to interpret the existence of LRD in the packet round-trip delay process, which we believe is caused by LRD of Internet traffic.

Reference-contexts: The RTO used to indicate when a packet can be assumed lost in the network by a sender and consequently invoke a retransmission event, will dramatically affect the end-to-end behavior of TCP/IP protocol <ref> [11] </ref>. No doubt, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the characteristics of the packet round-trip delay process (defined in section 2) in Internet, which is the most important metric for evaluating the performance of Internet. However, there are few studies on the packet round-trip delay process in literature so far.
