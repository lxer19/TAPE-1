Reference-contexts: These modules are summarized in the following: tokenizer : reads English texts and outputs tokenized texts. part-of-speech tagger : reads tokenized texts and outputs part-of-speech tagged texts. This tagger is based on Brill's <ref> (Brill 1992) </ref> part-of-speech tagger. converter : converts tagged texts into SUMMARIST internal representation. morpher : finds all the possible root forms of the input tokens, using a modified WordNet (Miller et al. 1990) demorphing program. phraser : finds all the possible collocations (multi word phrases) based on WordNet. token frequency counter

Reference-contexts: We describe these modules in the following sections. Position Method The position method is based on the assumption that sentence position correlates with importance in genres with regular structure <ref> (Edmundson 1969) </ref>. (Lin & Hovy 1997) proposed a method, Optimal Position Policy (OPP), to identify importance sentence position automatically. <p> The global OPP weight of a token is the sum of all the local OPP weights of that token over all sentences. Cue Phrases Phrases such as "in summary", "in conclusion", and superlatives ( "the best", "the most important") are good indications of important content <ref> (Edmundson 1969) </ref>. Cue phrases are sometimes genre dependent. For example, "we conclude" or "in conclusion" is more likely to occur in scientific literature. For this initial TIPSTER Phase III experiment, we manually compiled a list of cue phrases from the training corpus.

Reference-contexts: The minimum number of documents per cluster is set to regulate the size of a cluster. Complete-link algorithm <ref> (Frakes & Baeza-Yates 1992) </ref> is used in the current setup. These helper modules prepare necessary inputs for high level processing units such as the Position Method module, Topic Signature module, and the final Integration module. We describe these modules in the following sections.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we conclude this paper with a discussion of future directions. Text Summarization Tasks in TIPSTER Phase III Two tasks are devised in the initial text summarization evaluation in TIPSTER Phase III <ref> (Hand 1997) </ref>. One is the categorization task. The other is the adhoc retrieval task. The categorization task is used to evaluate generic summaries, which are summaries based on what is important in the original texts.

Reference-contexts: Because the amount of data is so overwhelming, it is simply not possible to rely solely on humans to process all the information. Automatic text processing systems are obvious solutions to the information overload problem. The TIPSTER program, sponsored by multiple U.S. government agencies <ref> (Harman 1994) </ref>, has spurred even greater interest in automatic text processing studies among academic and private research groups. In this paper, we describe the current status of SUMMARIST (Hovy & Lin 1997), an automated text summarization system, and its use in TIPSTER Phase III text summarization research.

Overview of SUMMARIST The goal of SUMMARIST is to generate summaries of multilingual input texts although SUMMARIST only processes English texts at this time. <p> The core of SUMMARIST is based on the following `equation': summarization = topic identification + topic interpretation + generation The functions of these three stages are briefly described as follows: Topic Identification: Identify the most important (central) topics of the texts <ref> (Lin 1997) </ref>. SUMMARIST uses positional importance (Edmundson 1969; Paij-mans 1994; Lin & Hovy 1997), cue phrases (Edmund-son 1969; Paice 1990; Teufel & Moens 1997), and word counting. Discourse structure-based importance will be added later (Marcu 1997; Kando 1997). <p> Topic Interpretation: To fuse concepts such as waiter, menu, and food into one generalized concept restaurant, we need more than the just simple word aggregation used in traditional information retrieval. SUMMARIST employs concept counting (Lin 1995) and topic signatures <ref> (Lin 1997) </ref> to tackle the fusion problem. <p> We describe these modules in the following sections.

Different sets of cue phrases were used depending on the source 1 of the input texts. We are currently examining methods to automatically generate cue phrases. Topic Signatures Topic signatures <ref> (Lin 1997) </ref> provide a way to represent concept co-occurrence patterns. For example, a concept co-occurrence pattern for topic earthquake would consist of several key concepts such as Richter scale, death toll, and magnitude which together uniquely identify it.

The major differences between topic signatures and the other techniques are that topic signatures can be acquired through statistical training and have a simpler structure. <ref> (Lin 1995) </ref> proposed a method to generalize concepts according to inter-concept relations such as is a, part of, member of, and substance of using a concept taxonomy (WordNet). This method can be integrated with the topic signature method to provide a more systematic organization for the automatically generated signatures.

Reference-contexts: SUMMARIST employs concept counting (Lin 1995) and topic signatures (Lin 1997) to tackle the fusion problem. Summary Generation: SUMMARIST will be able to generate "summaries" in various formats such as keywords (important noun phrases), extracts (important sentences in original texts), template-based summaries <ref> (McKeown & Radev 1995) </ref> (generated from pre-specified templates), and refined summaries (generated by a sentence planner and realizer (PENMAN 1989)). However, our current system can only produce keyword and extract type summaries. For more information regarding SUM-MARIST, please visit our project website at http://www.isi.edu/~cyl/summarist.

SUMMARIST combines existing robust natural language processing methods (morphological transformation and part-of-speech tagging), symbolic world knowledge (WordNet <ref> (Miller et al. 1990) </ref> and dictionaries), and information retrieval techniques (word counting and term distribution) to achieve high robustness and better concept-level generalization. <p> This tagger is based on Brill's (Brill 1992) part-of-speech tagger. converter : converts tagged texts into SUMMARIST internal representation. morpher : finds all the possible root forms of the input tokens, using a modified WordNet <ref> (Miller et al. 1990) </ref> demorphing program. phraser : finds all the possible collocations (multi word phrases) based on WordNet. token frequency counter : counts the occurrence of each token in an input text. tf idf weight calculator : calculates the tf idf (Salton 1988) weight for each input token, and ranks
