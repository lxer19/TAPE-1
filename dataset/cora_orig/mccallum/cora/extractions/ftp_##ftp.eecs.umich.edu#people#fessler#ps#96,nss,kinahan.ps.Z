Abstract: We present the results of combining volume imaging with the PENN-PET scanner with statistical image reconstruction methods such as the penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) method. The goal of this particular combination is to improve both classification and estimation tasks in PET imaging protocols where image quality is dominated by spatially-variant system responses and/or measurement statistics. The PENN-PET scanner has strongly spatially-varying system behavior due to its volume imaging design and the presence of detector gaps. Statistical methods are easily adapted to this scanner geometry, including the detector gaps, and have also been shown to have improved bias/variance tradeoffs compared to the standard filtered-backprojection (FBP) reconstruction method. The PWLS method requires fewer iterations and may be more tolerant of errors in the system model than other statistical methods. We present results demonstrating the improvement in image quality for PWLS image reconstructions of data from the PENN-PET scanner.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Statistical Image Reconstruction Methods. It is well recognized that statistical reconstruction algorithms, such as ML-EM, are particularly helpful in cases where measurement statistics dominate image quality <ref> [1] </ref>. To realize their full potential, these algorithms depend on accurate system models that describe the system response function and expected measurement statistics for a known object.

Reference-contexts: Neither of these assumptions are completely accurate in practice. An alternative approach is to assume Gaussian statistics and minimize a penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) objective function, rather than a Poisson likelihood objective function <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The effect of the correction steps on the weights are described below. Minimization of a PWLS objective function by successive over-relaxation (SOR) has been shown to be effective in cases where the data statistics are not Poisson <ref> [2] </ref>. The SOR algorithm is a coordinatedescent method where image pixels are estimated in place. In other words, F ( )x i is minimized independently for each image pixel, i, in turn. <p> The results obtained here are consistent to a simulation study (for a scanner without detector gaps) where true pixel variance was calculated from multiple realizations and showed that PWLS+SOR had improved bias-noise tradeoffs in comparison to FBP <ref> [2] </ref>. The incorporation of statistical information into the PWLS+SOR method could be done by other statistical methods, such as OSEM. Given the imperfect corrections that always occur in practice, hoewever, a statistical model that is insensitive to departures from the assumed shape of the data distribution is probably preferable.

Reference-contexts: Scanner System Model The PENN-PET scanner at the University of Pennsylvania is a volume-imaging PET camera with an axial field of view (FOV) of 12.8 cm, a transverse FOV of 50 cm and gaps in coverage of ~5 deg where the 6 planar detectors meet as illustrated in fig. 1 <ref> [3] </ref>. Since the scanner has no septa, data are acquired in 3D mode, with online rebinning of the 3D data into standard 2D sinograms via the singleslice rebinning (SSRB) algorithm [4]. <p> The corrected sinogram data, y c , can be described by: y a e e e y b c SSRB = -( ) 1 2 3 where y SSRB is the SSRB rebinned sinogram data, b is the fitted scatter and randoms subtraction <ref> [3] </ref>, a is the attenuation correction, and e i are efficiency corrections for i=1: axial variation due to SSRB rebinning of volume acquisition, i=2: sampling pattern from online rebinning, and i=3: detector efficiency variations.

The standard deviations are estimated based on the corrections applied to the raw sinogram data during the processing steps prior to the image reconstruction, and the effect of weighting the differences between estimated and measured projections takes into account the statistical quality of the data.

Reference-contexts: For the SOR minimization algorithm, 20 iterations were used, although 10 iterations would likely have given similar results. In addition, images reconstructed using the ordered-subsets ML-EM (OSEM) algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> were included for comparison. For the OSEM images the system model A, did not take into account any nonideal effects, such as attenuation correction.
