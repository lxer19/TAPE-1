Abstract: A reflection and refraction model for anisotropic surfaces is introduced. The anisotropy is simulated by small cylinders (added or subtracted) distributed on the anisotropic surface. Different levels of anisotropy are achieved by varying the distance between each cylinder and/or rising the cylinders more or less from the surface. Multidirectional anisotropy is modelled by orienting groups of cylinders in different direction. The intensity of the reflected light is computed by determining the visible and illuminated portion of the cylinders, taking self-blocking into account. We present two techniques to compute this in practice. In one the intensity is computed by sampling the surface of the cylinders. The other is an analytic solution. In the case of the diffuse component, the solution is exact. In the case of the specular component, an approximation is developed using a Cheby-shev polynomial approximation of the specular term, and integrating the polynomial.

A higher floor reduces the variation of the normals on the cylinders and increases the length of the floor. Figure 2 illustrates the control of the anisotropy by these two parameters, d and h.

Reference-contexts: This is the reason why these details must be captured by local reflection models.

To model the specular reflection, Torrance and Sparrow [24] assume that the surface is made of highly reflective microscopic facets distributed in v-grooves. <p> Finally images illustrating applications of anisotropy in computer graphics are presented and commented. 2 Previous Work Kajiya [13] attempted to compute analytically the reflected intensity from a continuous surface.

Reference-contexts: Moreover such an object representation would be prone to aliasing problems. To overcome these problems, approximations to some geometric models have been proposed. If we note D g the level of the geometry at which objects are usually defined (i.e. polygons or parametric surfaces), then displacement and bump mappings <ref> [4] </ref> [16] approximate what the geometric model D g+1 would define at a higher resolution or magnification. As the details become smaller, even surface mapping becomes highly subject to aliasing problems. <p> Since the normals are already defined for most of the surfaces used in computer graphics, the extra information required for introducing anisotropy is simply a tangent at each point of the surface. Many techniques have been developed to map textures [11] and perturbations of normals <ref> [4] </ref> onto objects; these techniques can easily be extended to map tangents onto objects. The cylinders are too small to be seen individually. For each cylinder, the viewer position is so far away relative to the cylinder's radius that its direction can be assumed to be constant over the cylinder.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the Kirchhoff solution is valid only if self-shadowing and multiple scattering are negligible. Even if this limitation is not considered, the size of the surface required (Fresnel zones) by the Kirchhoff solution and the stationary phase method used to approximate the integral <ref> [5] </ref> introduce new problems that are dependent of each surface type.

Reference-contexts: These surfaces are called anisotropic. Surfaces made of fur or burnished metal are examples where there is a strong correlation between the orientations of facets and the orientation of the surface. Bren-nan et al. <ref> [6] </ref> measured several natural surfaces and showed that surfaces like clouds, forests, oceans and even sand exhibit anisotropy. Anisotropy can be caused by a collection of strongly oriented elements, such as hair in fur or blades 1 All the reflection models discussed in this paper ignore the wavelength.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many objects in nature are visually very complex. Crow, as quoted in <ref> [13] </ref>, suggested having different levels of geometric models to capture this complexity. However, as the representation of an object requires the addition of smaller geometric models to define smaller details, the extra cost of modelling and rendering these details can become very high. <p> This paper first briefly surveys and discusses current anisotropic reflection models. The model based on cylinders is then presented in detail, with its parameters and solutions for the reflected light. Finally images illustrating applications of anisotropy in computer graphics are presented and commented. 2 Previous Work Kajiya <ref> [13] </ref> attempted to compute analytically the reflected intensity from a continuous surface. He bases his approach on the general Kirchhoff solution for scattering of electromagnetic waves [1] [2]. For given incident and reflected directions, the intensity reflected by a surface is computed. However, the method has its restrictions. <p> A group of adjacent cylinders oriented in one direction defines the D g+3 level while a set of groups of adjacent cylinders represents the D g+2 level. Figure 1 illustrates the interaction between these various levels. To orient the cylinders, surface frame bundles (to use the terminology of <ref> [13] </ref>) need to be established. One axis is the normal at the surface, N . Another axis is the tangent to the surface, T (thus perpendicular to the normal). This tangent allows the specification of the orientation of the cylinders on the surface.

This method can seriously alias the shadows for surfaces which exhibit high frequency behaviour. In these two approaches, the reflection intensities are computed once and kept in tables; interpolation is used for fast rendering.

Reference-contexts: Then the intensity reflected specularly to the viewer is considered directly proportional to the ratio of facets with their normal in this bisector direction. These last two models are only valid for "scratched" surfaces with negligible self-shadowing and multiple scattering. Miller <ref> [17] </ref> introduced the use of cylinders to simulate anisotropy. When projecting a cylinder onto the viewing screen, only half of it is visible. The intensities at equal intervals of this projected cylinder are computed and averaged.

Reference-contexts: The intensities at equal intervals of this projected cylinder are computed and averaged. Later, at the rendering stage, if scratches are oriented in the direction of one cylinder, the computed intensity is used to simulate the effect of the anisotropy of the surface. Miller also adapts the reflectance sphere <ref> [28] </ref> for faster rendering. However, the technique inherits the limitations of the reflectance sphere. Thus, light sources are expected to be far from all the objects in a scene.
