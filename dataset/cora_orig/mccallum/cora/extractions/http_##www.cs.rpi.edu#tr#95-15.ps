Reference-contexts: As I announced in <ref> [8] </ref> without proof, this conjecture is true when limited to systems u ! v in which u has no self overlap, i.e., systems in which there exist no ff; fi; fl 6= such that u = fffi = fifl.

Reference-contexts: In a later paper [10] Kurth gives a complete characterization of all such systems with infinite derivations based on loops of length 3. Zantema and Geser <ref> [9] </ref> have focused on the class of systems given by single rules of the form c m b n ! b p c q , m; n; p; q 1. <p> The following is an ill behaved derivation in the system with the one rule ccb ! bbccc (a system of the kind studied by Zantema and Geser in <ref> [9] </ref>): ccccbb ccbbcccb bbcccbcccb bbcbbccccccb bbcbbccccbbccc bbcbbccbbcccbccc To prove that this derivation is ill behaved we note that the inhibition system has six rules, whose right sides are, respectively, bbccc, bbccc, bbccc, bbccc, bbccc and bbccc. <p> The conditions (C2) and (C3) are tested similarly. The system has an ill behaved derivation if and only if it satisfies at least one of these conditions.2 Example 1. The system c m b n ! b h c k (studied in <ref> [9] </ref>) where h &gt; n &gt; 0 and k &gt; m &gt; 0, has an ill behaved derivation. <p> Theorem 6.2. There exist one-rule semi-Thue systems that have ill behaved derivations but no infinite derivations. Proof: The system ccbb ! bbbccc shown to be uniformly terminating in <ref> [9] </ref> has a finite ill behaved derivation, as we have just demonstrated.2 Open question. Does there exist a one-rule semi-Thue system with an infinite well behaved derivation and a finite ill behaved derivation but no infinite ill behaved derivation? Example 2.

Reference-contexts: One of these is a fl Supported by Grant No. CCR-9500182 from the National Science Foundation. 1 complete characterization of all one-rule semi-Thue systems that have an infinite derivation based on a loop of length 2. In a later paper <ref> [10] </ref> Kurth gives a complete characterization of all such systems with infinite derivations based on loops of length 3. <p> Examples. This section illustrates the main theorem of Section 8. Theorem 9.1. If a one-rule semi-Thue system has a loop of length 2 then it has an infinite well behaved derivation that is generated by such a loop. Proof: By Theorem 1 of <ref> [10] </ref>, in such a system there exist words fi; ffi, and nonnull words *; OE; fl; j such that u = *OE = flj and v = fifl* = jOEffi. <p> It has LR trails of lengths 1 and 2 from a to abaaab, and an RL trail from abaaab to aaaba, and no other trails. Thus it has no infinite well behaved derivation. Example 5. For completeness we mention Kurth's Example 3 (also on p. 16 of <ref> [10] </ref>): ababab ! babaabab. This system is like his Example 2 in that it has a loop of length 3, but it is left to the reader to verify that it has no infinite well behaved derivation.
