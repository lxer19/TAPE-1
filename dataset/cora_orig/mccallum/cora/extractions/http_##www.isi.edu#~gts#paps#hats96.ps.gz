Abstract: The increasing popularity and importance of electronic commerce makes very apparent the issue of privacy and anonymity for electronic consumers. Technologies are already in existence that offer some degree of electronic privacy, e.g., electronic/digital cash. However, the mere fact that electronic commerce is conducted over existing network infrastructure (such as the global Internet) runs counter to the privacy of the consumer. This is due mainly to the end-to-end nature of application protocols that are used as vehicles for electronic commerce World-Wide Web (WWW), Electronic Mail, File Transfer Protocols and others. In this paper we discuss the issue of consumer anonymity and propose some solutions for the activities that typically "surround" electronic payment: pre-purchase browsing and merchandise delivery.

Reference-contexts: If mutual anonymity is to be attained without the involvement of a trusted third party, we need to look into protocols for anonymous fair exchange <ref> [1] </ref>. 7 Conclusions In this paper we discussed the issue of consumer anonymity in the setting of secure electronic commerce. More specifically, we concentrated on consumer anonymity during Pre-Purchase Browsing (PPB) and Electronic Merchandise Delivery (EMD).

Reference-contexts: A simple (but not always practical) approach is for the consumer to post OFFER REQ on an anonymous bulletin board, e.g. a USENET newsgroup and solicit bids. If the consumer trusts COURT or another trusted third party to properly certify the merchants' public keys in an anonymous way (see <ref> [2] </ref>), the protocols can be run almost exactly as described above, but without the consumer knowing the merchant's identity.

Reference-contexts: Anonymous shopping requires some form of anonymous message-based communication. This communication can be synchronous (real-time, e.g., via WWW) or asynchronous (store-and-forward, e.g., via email.) In case of synchronous communication we assume the existence of a protocol-specific anonymizer or a mix <ref> [15] </ref>. An anonymizer is essentially a program that functions as a conduit between the real sender and receiver and hides the identity of the sender, e.g., by using a random alias. In case of asynchronous communication, we assume the existence of an anonymizing relay service.
