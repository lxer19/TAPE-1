Abstract: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) has been widely used for studying the performance of optical networks, especially those employing optical passive star couplers. Many models have been proposed for WDM on an optical passive star coupler, such as each station equipped with a single tunable transmitter and a single fixed wavelength receiver, and each station with multiple tunable transmitters and multiple tunable receivers. The current technology only allows the transceivers to be tunable in a small range, a fact ignored in previous studies. In this paper, we focus on the design of WDM optical passive star networks with tunable transmitters of limited tuning range and fixed wavelength receivers. The limited tuning range has effects on the maximum delay, the total number of wavelengths which can be used, and thetopological embedding. Complete graphs, meshes and hypercubes are the three topologies studied in this paper. The relationship between the total number of wavelengths which can be utilized and the embedded topology is established. The bound for the maximum delay is analyzed. The optimal embedding algorithms are given for the systems embedded with one of the three topologies.

Reference-contexts: However, while optical networks present new possibilities for high speed networks, they also present new network design problems that must be surmounted before they become practical. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) has been used widely for studying the throughput performance of optical networks <ref> [1, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] </ref>, especially those employing optical passive star couplers [2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 17] . The reason is that electronically operated interface devices can not match the speed of the optical transmission media. <p> Receivers' wavelength assignment Divide N stations into p disjoint sets, N i with jN i j 2 (0 i p 1). Assign wavelength w i to the receivers of the stations in N i . Divide N i into two disjoint sets L <ref> [i; 1] </ref> and L [i; 2] such that jjL [i; 1]j jL [i; 2]jj 1. 2. Transmitters' wavelength assignment For each station in L [i; 1], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i k + 1; i] for i k 1 and [0; k 1] for i &lt; <p> Assign wavelength w i to the receivers of the stations in N i . Divide N i into two disjoint sets L <ref> [i; 1] </ref> and L [i; 2] such that jjL [i; 1]j jL [i; 2]jj 1. 2. Transmitters' wavelength assignment For each station in L [i; 1], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i k + 1; i] for i k 1 and [0; k 1] for i &lt; k 1. <p> Assign wavelength w i to the receivers of the stations in N i . Divide N i into two disjoint sets L <ref> [i; 1] </ref> and L [i; 2] such that jjL [i; 1]j jL [i; 2]jj 1. 2. Transmitters' wavelength assignment For each station in L [i; 1], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i k + 1; i] for i k 1 and [0; k 1] for i &lt; k 1. <p> This shows its has the optimal maximum delay. Proof: We first consider N 2 fl p. Since jN i j 2 for 0 i p 1, there is at least one station in L <ref> [i; 1] </ref> and L [i; 2] respectively. Let A and B be two stations in the system with their receivers' occupying w i and w j respectively with i j. Consider the communication between A and B. <p> Let A and B be two stations in the system with their receivers' occupying w i and w j respectively with i j. Consider the communication between A and B. If A 2 L <ref> [i, 1] </ref>, A can send its message to another station C which is in L [i,2] by tuning its transmitter to w i . <p> By Complete-Graph-Embedding, the whole system has the optimal maximum delay. For example, the system with N=22, p=7 and k=3. The channel graph generated by Algorithm Complete-Graph-Embedding is: N i = f3i; 3i + 1; 3i + 2g; L <ref> [i; 1] </ref> = f3ig; and L [i; 2] = f3i + 1; 3i + 2g for 0 i 5: N 6 = Another example is for N=12, p=7 and k=3. Let N i be nonempty for 0 i 6. <p> We discuss how to implement one-to-all broadcasting for parallel computing by using Algorithm Complete-Graph-Embedding for N 2 fl p. One-to-all broadcasting is one of the most important operations in parallel computing. Let A be a station in N i . A in L <ref> [i, 1] </ref>, sends a message to all the stations whose receivers occupy the wavelengths less than w i . At the same time, A sends the message to a station B in L [i, 2].

The reason is that electronically operated interface devices can not match the speed of the optical transmission media. WDM is used to divide the total available bandwidth into different wavelengths, each running at a speed compatible with electronic devices. <p> Receivers' wavelength assignment Divide N stations into p disjoint sets, N i with jN i j 2 (0 i p 1). Assign wavelength w i to the receivers of the stations in N i . Divide N i into two disjoint sets L [i; 1] and L <ref> [i; 2] </ref> such that jjL [i; 1]j jL [i; 2]jj 1. 2. Transmitters' wavelength assignment For each station in L [i; 1], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i k + 1; i] for i k 1 and [0; k 1] for i &lt; k 1. <p> Assign wavelength w i to the receivers of the stations in N i . Divide N i into two disjoint sets L [i; 1] and L <ref> [i; 2] </ref> such that jjL [i; 1]j jL [i; 2]jj 1. 2. Transmitters' wavelength assignment For each station in L [i; 1], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i k + 1; i] for i k 1 and [0; k 1] for i &lt; k 1. For each station in L [i; 2], assign its tuning <p> jjL [i; 1]j jL <ref> [i; 2] </ref>jj 1. 2. Transmitters' wavelength assignment For each station in L [i; 1], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i k + 1; i] for i k 1 and [0; k 1] for i &lt; k 1. For each station in L [i; 2], assign its tuning range of its transmitter to be [i; i + k 1] for i p k and [p k; p 1] for i &gt; p k. Algorithm C omplete-Graph-Embedding for N &lt; 2 fl p 1. <p> This shows its has the optimal maximum delay. Proof: We first consider N 2 fl p. Since jN i j 2 for 0 i p 1, there is at least one station in L [i; 1] and L <ref> [i; 2] </ref> respectively. Let A and B be two stations in the system with their receivers' occupying w i and w j respectively with i j. Consider the communication between A and B. <p> If A 2 L [i, 1], A can send its message to another station C which is in L [i,2] by tuning its transmitter to w i . C sends that message from A to B by pass those stations which is in L <ref> [l, 2] </ref> for l = i + p fl (k 1); 1 p b ji k1 c. So the communication from A to B is no more than b p1 k1 c + 1 hops. <p> By Complete-Graph-Embedding, the whole system has the optimal maximum delay. For example, the system with N=22, p=7 and k=3. The channel graph generated by Algorithm Complete-Graph-Embedding is: N i = f3i; 3i + 1; 3i + 2g; L [i; 1] = f3ig; and L <ref> [i; 2] </ref> = f3i + 1; 3i + 2g for 0 i 5: N 6 = Another example is for N=12, p=7 and k=3. Let N i be nonempty for 0 i 6. The optimal maximum delay can be achieved by our algorithm for the channel assignment. <p> Let A be a station in N i . A in L [i, 1], sends a message to all the stations whose receivers occupy the wavelengths less than w i . At the same time, A sends the message to a station B in L <ref> [i, 2] </ref>. B then sends the message to all the stations whose receivers occupy wavelengths greater than w i .
