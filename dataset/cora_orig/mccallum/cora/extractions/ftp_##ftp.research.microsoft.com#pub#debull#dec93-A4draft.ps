Reference-contexts: For nested-loops join, the DB2 optimizers will consider sorting the outer table on the join-predicate columns, and DB2/* even considers sorting a table before the join for a later GROUP BY, ORDER BY, or DISTINCT clause. The DB2 for MVS optimizer also supports the hybrid join <ref> [CHH + 91] </ref>, a mixture of the other two join methods. It is possibly best described as a nested-loops join with an ordered outer table and batched RID processing on the inner table".

Reference-contexts: DB2 for MVS allows a user to specify the OPTIMIZE FOR N ROWS clause on any query to indicate that only N rows will be fetched from the cursor before closing it <ref> [DB293c] </ref>. In this case, DB2 for MVS will separate costs into those costs that are associated with a cursor being opened and costs that are incurred with each fetch. <p> The ability to change statistics manually is very useful, especially in modelling production applications on test databases. DB2/* with Starburst will support this capability as well. DB2 for MVS and DB2/* share the same basic filter factor formulas <ref> [DB293c] </ref>. The default values, used for expressions, host variables, and parameter markers, have been tuned to the usage patterns of typical customers and are essentially the same in all the products.

As a result, DB2/* uses a "greedy" algorithm <ref> [Loh88a] </ref> which is very efficient, since it never backtracks. Since the greedy algorithm always pursues the cheapest joins, it is possible for the optimizer to cache the result of a join in a temporary table and use it as the inner table of a later join.

Reference-contexts: Searching a larger percentage of all the join combinations may allow the optimizer to find a more efficient plan but results in increased processing costs for the query optimization process itself <ref> [OL90] </ref>. DB2/* with Starburst will also consider any predicate referencing more than one table to act as a join predicate, avoiding potential Cartesian products. For example, a predicate of the form X:1 + Y:2 &gt; Z:4 can be used to join tables X, Y, and Z.

However, special-case heuristics are used to attempt to recognize cases where Cartesian joins can be beneficial. <p> All the products use the classic formulas for compound predicates, which assume independence of conjuncts and hence multiply their respective filter factors <ref> [SAC + 79] </ref>. Occasionally, accurate filter factors for compound predicates can be difficult to estimate due to predicate correlation. To reduce this problem, DB2 for MVS generally will use only the most selective predicate for any particular column when computing result size.
