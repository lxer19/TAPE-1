Preisendorfer, </author> <year> 1987: </year> <title> Origins and levels of monthly and seasonal forecast skill for United States surface air temperature determined by canonical correlations analysis. </title> <journal> Mon.

Reference-contexts: Mardia et al. 1979). Its development for multivariate time series analysis owes much to the work of of Brillinger and Priestley and co-authors (Brillinger 1981, Priestley, 1987). In the atmospheric science literature principal components are more frequently known as empirical orthogonal functions <ref> (Barnett and Preisendorfer 1987, Horel 1981, Jolliffe 1986, Lorenz 1956) </ref>. Generalizations of EOF for the examination of coupled in fields, include canonical correlation analysis and singular value decomposition analysis (Barnett and Preisendorfer 1987, Bretherton et al. 1991, Wallace et al. 1991). <p> When analyzing two fields x and y canonical correlation analysis finds patterns a and b so that the marginal correlation between a fl x (t) and b fl y (t) is maximized. In the atmospheric sciences, this has been found a useful technique for analyzing two coupled fields <ref> (Barnett and Preisendorfer 1987, Bretherton et al. 1991) </ref>. When only one field is analyzed, the technique can be used to find the canonical correlation patterns between x (t) and x (t + 1). As such, this technique incorporates temporal information which is not explicitly considered by the EOF analysis. <p> To circumvent this problem, it is customary to first project the data on the first k empirical orthogonal functions of x (t), before applying the canonical correlations algorithm. This is known as the Barnett-Preisendorfer (BP) approach to CCA <ref> (Barnett and Preisendorfer 1987) </ref>. Bretherton et al. (1991) suggest to take k such that the first k EOFs explain between about 70 and 80% of the variance in the field.

Reference-contexts: The fact that both EOFs are combinations of the NAO and PNA pattern suggests that from an interprative point of view it may be useful to rotate the EOFs <ref> (Barnston and Livezey 1987, Richman 1988) </ref>. We also computed the EOFs based on the second half of the data (1970-1994). The results (not shown) were compared to the patterns in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The empirical study of fluid motion in atmospheric sciences and oceanography presents a number of interesting statistical problems. While the physical principles and the equations of motion describing evolution of such systems over shorter periods are quite well established <ref> (e.g. Smagorinsky 1969, Wallace and Hubbs 1977, and Holton 1992) </ref>, summary characterization of the low frequency behavior of the system in terms of spatial and temporal variation is more difficult except for simple problems such as the wave equation in a homogeneous medium.
