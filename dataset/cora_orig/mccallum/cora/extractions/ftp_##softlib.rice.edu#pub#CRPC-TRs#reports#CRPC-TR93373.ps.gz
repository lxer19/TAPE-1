Title: NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS WITH AN OVERLAPPING ADDITIVE SCHWARZ SOLVER FOR 3-D PARALLEL RESERVOIR SIMULATION  
Author: LUCA F. PAVARINO AND MARCELO RAM E 
Abstract: Domain decomposition methods are a major area of contemporary research in numerical analysis of partial differential equations. They provide robust, parallel and scalable preconditioned iterative methods for the large linear systems arising when continuous problems are discretized by finite elements, finite differences or spectral methods. This paper presents some numerical experiments on a distributed memory parallel computer, the 512 processor Caltech Touchstone Delta. An overlapping additive Schwarz method is implemented for the mixed finite element discretization of second order elliptic problems in three dimensions, arising from flow models in reservoir simulation. These problems are characterized by large variations in the coefficients of the elliptic operator, often associated with short correlation lengths, which make the problems very ill-conditioned. The results confirm the theoretical bound on the condition number of the iteration operator and show the advantage of domain decomposition preconditioning as opposed to a simpler but less robust diagonal preconditioner.

Reference-contexts: This stopping criterion is preconditioner independent and guarantees roughly a six-digit precision in the energy norm. See Ashby, Manteuffel and Saylor <ref> [1] </ref> for a discussion of stopping criteria. The local and coarse problems in the ASM preconditioner are solved directly with Lapack banded subroutines, which are expensive but very robust. We are in the process of studying the use of approximate local solvers. <p> Therefore the coarse problem is essential to produce a scalable algorithm. 5.3. 3-D checkerboard. We now study how the magnitude of the coefficient jumps affects the methods. The global domain = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 is decomposed into 64 = 4 fi 4 fi 4 cubic subdomains, each with size 13 fi 13 fi 13. <p> On the other hand, after an initial growth, ASM becomes insensitive to the coefficient jumps and the condition number seems to converge to a limit. We have also run a large anisotropic problem with 1,124,864 unknowns, where a cubic domain = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 is divided into 512 = 8 fi 8 fi 8 subdomains of size 13 fi 13 fi 13. The coefficient jumps are again arranged in a checkerboard fashion, but with anisotropic values as in the case of cubic scaling. Table 6 shows the results for ASM. <p> We have two cases: a) the jumps are in the subdomains interior (no jumps on the interface) or b) the jumps are across subdomain boundaries (jumps on the interface). In a cubic domain = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 , the coefficient K equals 10 ff I inside two spheres of radius 0.2 centered at ( 1 4 ; 1 4 ; 3 4 ), while K = I in the rest of ; see Figure 4. is discretized by 24 fi 24 fi 24 elements. <p> In the last Table 8, we report a traditional scaling for a problem with jumps unaligned with the subdomain boundaries, which gives more insight into the causes of deterioration of the ASM convergence rate. The domain = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 is again as in spheres and K = I in the rest of . We fix a small global size, 24 fi 24 fi 24, in order to start the scaling with a small number of subdomains.

Reference-contexts: : This linear system is solved iteratively and the iteration is usually accelerated by a Krylov space method: if the original problem is symmetric and positive definite, we can use the conjugate gradient method, otherwise we can use GMRES or other methods for general systems; see Freund, Golub and Nachtigal <ref> [11] </ref> for an introduction to Krylov methods. The applications where (10) is the discretization of an elliptic problem over a domain decomposed into subdomains i is particularly important.
