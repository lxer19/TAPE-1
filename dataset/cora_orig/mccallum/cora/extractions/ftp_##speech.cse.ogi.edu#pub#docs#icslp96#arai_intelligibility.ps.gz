Abstract: The effect of filtering the time trajectories of spectral envelopes on speech intelligibility was investigated. Since LPC cepstrum forms the basis of many automatic speech recognition systems, we filtered time trajectories of LPC cepstrum of speech sounds, and the modified speech was reconstructed after the filtering. For processing, we applied low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters. The results of the accuracy from the perceptual experiments for Japanese syllables show that speech intelligibility is not severely impaired as long as the filtered spectral components have 1) a rate of change faster than 1 Hz when high-pass filtered, 2) a rate of change slower than 24 Hz

Reference-contexts: One way to identify the useful features is to eliminate a given feature, reconstruct the speech, and determine experimentally its intelligibility. Temporal processing of time trajectories of cepstral coefficients of speech is becoming a common procedure in current ASR. The so-called delta features <ref> [1] </ref> are calculated as linear regression coefficients over a short segment of a time trajectory to emphasize dynamic characteristics of the original features.

Reference-contexts: This is effectively applying an FIR band-pass filter which eliminates the DC component in the time trajectory and applies 6 dB/oct emphasis on changes up to about 12 Hz. RASTA processing <ref> [2] </ref> also eliminates the DC but, unlike delta feature computation, passes components between 1 and 12 Hz unattenuated. Both techniques appear to achieve some degree of robustness to channel variations.

The goal of our project was to examine the effect of the temporal filtering of the trajectories of spectral features on the intelligibility of the reconstructed speech. Drullman <ref> [3, 4] </ref> reported the effect of temporal filtering of the spectral envelope on the intelligibility of speech. In his study, the original speech was split into a series of frequency bands and the magnitude envelope of the analytic signal for each band was low-pass and high-pass filtered.

Reference-contexts: The intelligibility for the high-pass filtered condition starts decreasing above 1 Hz. The intersection of the two curves is located between 3 and 4 Hz. Interestingly, this rate of change approximately coincides with the syllabic rate of speech <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.2. Band-Pass Filtering One native Japanese subject (the first author of this paper) participated in the preliminary perceptual experiment with band-pass filtering cepstral coefficient trajectories.
