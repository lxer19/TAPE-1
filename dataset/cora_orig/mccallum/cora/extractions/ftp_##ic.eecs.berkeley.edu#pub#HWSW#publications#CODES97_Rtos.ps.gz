Reference-contexts: We will use experimental results to identify bottlenecks and potential area for further optimization. 1 Our environment still require some example-specific re-wiring. This could be avoided by using a programmable prototyping board (e.g. APTIX) <ref> [1] </ref>, but so far re-wiring was only a minor portion of total experiment time. 5 4.4 Results So far we have experimented with a subset of dashboard specification (a belt controller) that has two tasks and uses two timers, using polling and round-robin scheduling. Initial results are encouraging.

Reference-contexts: RTOSs created in our approach offer an ease of use comparable to commercial RTOSs, and yet since they are generated for a specific example, they can be optimized based on the same information used to optimize hand-written code. We have implemented our approach within Polis <ref> [2] </ref>, a system for HW/SW co-design of embedded system. To evaluate the Polis generated RTOS we have developed a prototyping environment which we use to compare Polis against a commercial operating system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
