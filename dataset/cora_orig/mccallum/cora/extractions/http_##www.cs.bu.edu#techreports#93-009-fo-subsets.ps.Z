Title: A Characterization of First-Order Definable Subsets on Classes of Finite Total Orders  
Author: A. J. Kfoury M. Wymann-Boni 
Date: August 1993  
Affiliation: Boston University  
Abstract: We give an explicit and easy-to-verify characterization for subsets in finite total orders (infinitely many of them in general) to be uniformly definable by a first-order formula. From this characterization we derive immediately that Beth's de-finability theorem does not hold in any class of finite total orders, as well as that McColm's first conjecture is true for all classes of finite total orders. Another consequence is a natural 0-1 law for definable subsets on finite total orders expressed as a statement about the pos sible densities of first-order definable subsets.

Reference-contexts: The formula contains one such formula for every one of finitely many exceptions. This completes the proof. 2 4 Applications of the Characterization From our characterization we gain an improved refutation of well-known model theoretic theorems such as compactness and Beth's definability theorem. Gurevich showed in <ref> [11] </ref> that none of these (nor some other theorems which are true for the infinite case) hold in finite model theory. For this it suffices to exhibit a single class of structures violating the theorem.
