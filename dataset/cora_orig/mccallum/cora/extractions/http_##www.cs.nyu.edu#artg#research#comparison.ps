Abstract: This study compares the performance of encrypted and nonencrypted Web communications. It presents measurements of the most widely used secure Web encryptionthe Secure HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTPS) on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 3.0 with 40 and 128 bit RC4 encryption. Encryption increases the response times of two popular Web servers, Netscape Enterprise Server 3.5.1 and Microsoft IIS 4.0, by at most 22%. We view this additional delay imposed by encryption as moderate, and therefore encourage Web sites to routinely use secure communications.

Reference-contexts: Secret keys are frequently used for streaming encryption because public key encryption is much more expensive. For more details, see Bolyards nice trace of SSL session setup <ref> [Bolyard97] </ref>. On top of SSL, the client and server exchange one or more HTTP messages. A single HTTP message is exchanged in HTTP/1.0; multiple messages would be exchanged in keep-alive or persistent connections [Fielding98].

Reference-contexts: For more details, see Bolyards nice trace of SSL session setup [Bolyard97]. On top of SSL, the client and server exchange one or more HTTP messages. A single HTTP message is exchanged in HTTP/1.0; multiple messages would be exchanged in keep-alive or persistent connections <ref> [Fielding98] </ref>. To use encryption the application code issues calls to SSL_write () and SSL_read (), instead of calls to TCP socket write () and read (), respectively. The performance of the encryption algorithm RC4 [RC4] was studied. RC4 is a variable keysize stream cipher designed by Ron Rivest. <p> This size distribution is similar to that of documents requested on the Web as observed in traces from an Internet Service Provider and an Intranet in 1998 [Goldberg98B]. The documents contained typical HTML text (actually, the beginning of the HTTP/1.1 specification <ref> [Fielding98] </ref>). The robot browser sequentially requested each of the 24 documents many times. The robot measured the duration at the client between just before the client robot issued the SSL_write () of the request and just after the client completed the SSL_read () of the response.

Reference-contexts: Conducting SSL communications involves the following steps: A client establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with a server, which involves one round-trip message delay when no failure occurs. On top of TCP, the client and server establish a secure SSL communication channel <ref> [Freier96] </ref>. The application implements this by issuing an SSL_connect () call to the SSL library. The client and server negotiate a mutually agreeable cipher, which is a stream encryption algorithm and an authentication method pair.

Reference-contexts: It communicates via Winsock 2.0. To minimize contention with itself the robot browser runs singlethreaded on an otherwise idle machine. A widespread SSL implementation was integrated into the robot by one of usSchmitt. SSLeay version 0.8.1, written by Eric A. Young <ref> [Hudson] </ref> was used. It supports SSL versions 2.0 and 3.0. The robot does not authenticate the server since this is a client side activity. Netscape Enterprise Server 3.5.1 and Microsoft IIS 4.0 were both installed on the server PC.

Designed for byte-oriented operations, RC4 is expected to run quickly, as it uses only 8 to 16 instructions per byte. We studied the RC4 because it is widely used.
