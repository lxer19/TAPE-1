Title: Wildcard Dimensions, Coding Theory and Fault-Tolerant Meshes and Hypercubes  
Author: Jehoshua Bruck Robert Cypher Ching-Tien Ho 
Abstract: Hypercubes, meshes and tori are well known interconnection networks for parallel computers. The sets of edges in those graphs can be partitioned to dimensions. It is well known that the hypercube can be extended by adding a wildcard dimension resulting in a folded hypercube that has better fault-tolerant and communication capabilities. First we prove that the folded hypercube is optimal in the sense that only a single wildcard dimension can be added to the hypercube. We then investigate the idea of adding wildcard dimensions to d-dimensional meshes and tori. Using techniques from error correcting codes we construct d-dimensional meshes and tori with wildcard dimensions. Finally, we show how these constructions can be used to tolerate edge and node faults in mesh and torus networks.

Reference-contexts: The key to our fault-tolerant mesh constructions is a technique for adding redundant edges using what we call wildcard dimensions. While it was known that it is possible to add a single wildcard dimension to a hypercube <ref> [1] </ref>, it was not known if more wildcard dimensions can be added to hypercubes, nor was it known if wildcard dimensions can be added to mesh and torus networks. <p> In [9] it was suggested to add another set of edges to the hypercube, called the wildcard dimension, resulting in a folded hypercube network. (A related idea of adding an extra dimension was presented in the definition of the extra-stage cube network <ref> [1] </ref>.) The folded hypercube topology was also defined independently in [6], but with a different name (the bisectional interconnection network) and with a different addressing scheme for the nodes. A formal definition of the folded hypercube network is given next.

Reference-contexts: Given an arbitrary set A, jAj = d, where A S 2 , the graph G (2; d; A) is isomorphic to Q d .

A natural question is whether it is possible to extend the hypercube by more than a single wildcard dimension.

Reference-contexts: Note that the parameter n in Corollary 3 is a prime number. This restriction can be removed and while still guaranteeing that the graph G (n; d; S) is optimally connected. We now present this general theorem. The proof is omitted here and can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Theorem 6 Let d be any integer where d 2, let n be an integer where n 3, and let S V (n; d) where d jSj n. Then the graph G (n; d; S) is optimally connected.

Reference-contexts: Minimizing the cost in this model amounts to constructing a fault-tolerant graph with minimum degree. While our focus is on tolerating edge faults, it is natural to also consider what happens when there are node faults <ref> [5] </ref>. Because our fault-tolerant constructions do not have redundant nodes, it is clear that the target graph will not be contained in the healthy portion of the fault-tolerant graph when it contains node faults. However, we will show that our constructions also have optimal connectivity properties, given their degree.

Reference-contexts: For example, in F 4 , the neighbors of node (0000) are (0001); (0010); (0100), (1000) and (1111). The structure of Q d and F d can be described using a more general framework, see also <ref> [8] </ref>. The idea is to assume that every node in a graph with 2 d nodes is represented by a unique string of d bits. The edges are specified by a set of offsets, denoted by S, of binary vectors of length d. <p> It was proven in <ref> [8] </ref> that Q d and F d are related in a rather interesting way. Given an arbitrary set A, jAj = d, where A S 2 , the graph G (2; d; A) is isomorphic to Q d .

Reference-contexts: Our construction follows from known constructions in error-correcting block codes. For more details on this subject refer to <ref> [10] </ref>. The main issue in the theory of error correcting codes is to construct a large set of vectors (code) with the property that the Hamming distance between any two vectors in the code is larger than a predefined parameter d 0 (the minimum distance).
