Abstract: This paper introduces new techniques for the efficient computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for a finite group G and in so doing, relates the complexity of a finite group to its adapted diameter, relative to a given generating set and chain of subgroups. Consequently, we are able to show, for the first time, that the complexity of the DFT of a finite group is intimately related to group structure and thereby begin to link two major areas of research in computational group theory. In many particular cases, the resulting algorithms have potential applications for data analysis and signal processing. Given a chain of subgroups for a group G we introduce a technique which produces factorizations of group elements into short products of elements which commute with various subgroups along the chain. The commutativity properties of the factors is used to to show that for any irreducible matrix representation of the group these elements will have factorizations as highly structured sparse matrices. This allows a separation of variables style algorithm to be used in computing the associated DFT and consequent speedups follow immediately. In particular, this technique recovers the best known algorithms for the symmetric groups and wreath products and beyond that, dramatically improves on the known complexity of the DFT for the finite groups GL(n; q) and gives first complexity results for all finite classical groups, finite groups of Lie type and groups with a (B; N )-pair.

Reference-contexts: Strong generating sets arise naturally in the context of many algorithmic issues in computational group theory [33]. In particular, fast algorithms for their construction for stabilizer subgroup chains in permutation groups are a cornerstone for many important techniques <ref> [1] </ref>. The notion of diameter has a natural extension to subgroup chains and strong generating sets.

Reference-contexts: Remark. The requirement of adaptability does not limit us.

Reference-contexts: It seems highly likely that better choices for either are possible. Always, commutativity will need to be exploited and here it may be necessary to effectively compute the centralizers of various subsets of elements. Recent advances in computational group theory for matrix groups <ref> [4] </ref> may prove useful. In fact slightly more complicated variants of Theorem 3.2 and its Corollary can improve Theorem 4.4. For an indication of this approach see Section 6. 2. Earlier work.

Reference-contexts: When this approach is adopted, the complexity of the DFT can be measured as the c-linear complexity of the DFT matrix <ref> [6] </ref>. The c-linear complexity of a group G, is defined to be the minimum c-linear complexity of any DFT matrix for G. Assuming a choice of unitary representations, the results stated here can all be translated into statements about the 2-linear complexity of finite groups.

Reference-contexts: Note that in this case the bases given by either Young's orthogonal form or Young's seminormal form are adapted for the chain of subgroups for S n .
