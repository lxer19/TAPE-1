Title: Sweeping Simplices: A fast iso-surface extraction algorithm for unstructured grids

Abstract: We present an algorithm that accelerates the extraction of iso-surfaces from unstructured grids by avoiding the traversal of the entire set of cells in the volume. The algorithm consists of a sweep algorithm and a data decomposition scheme. The sweep algorithm incrementally locates intersected elements and the data decomposition scheme restricts the algorithm's worst-case performance. For data sets consisting of hundreds of thousands of elements, our algorithm can reduce the cell traversal time more than 90% over the naive iso-surface extraction algorithm, thus facilitating interactive probing of scalar fields for large-scale problems on unstructured three-dimensional grids.

Reference-contexts: We present a new algorithm that overcomes the previous obstacles for interactive iso-surface extraction on unstructured grids. The marching cubes algorithm proposed by Lorensen and Cline <ref> [1] </ref> has become a standard technique to generate iso-surfaces. The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer scheme to locate the surface within each cell that serves as a logical unit encompassed by eight data values at its corners. <p> The algorithm scans through each cell, analyzes the data, and then maps the cell into a lookup table. The lookup table provides the necessary information for fast iso-surface reconstructions. The algorithm can be further accelerated by using pixel-to-pixel, line-to-line, and slice-to-slice coherence <ref> [1] </ref>, and by adopting spatial decomposition methods such as octrees [2]. Although the marching cubes algorithm originates from medical applications, which typically use structured grids, the algorithm can be extended to problems using unstructured grids or tetrahedral elements. A naive implementation of the algorithm works as follows.

A naive implementation of the algorithm works as follows. Each cell in the field is traversed. <p> In the following sections, we begin by surveying related work. We then describe our sweep algorithm and data decomposition scheme. Finally, we conclude with a detailed algorithm analysis and results of simulation studies. 2 Related Work 2.1 Octrees Wilhelms and Van Gelder <ref> [2] </ref> use an octree data structure to accelerate iso-surface extraction. The nodes of the octrees store the summary information about the underlying sub-volumes.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, octrees method is sensitive to high-frequency noise within the data. 2.2 MinMax Lists It is obvious that only the cells that have higher maximum value and lower minimum value than the given iso-value are intersected by the iso-surfaces. Giles and Haimes <ref> [3] </ref> have developed an algorithm that accelerates the cell traversal process by sorting the elements by their maximum and minimum values to form two separate lists. They also calculate a global maximum, z, among the differences of all cells' two extreme values.
