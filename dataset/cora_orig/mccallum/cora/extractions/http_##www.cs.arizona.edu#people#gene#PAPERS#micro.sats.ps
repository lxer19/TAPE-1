Abstract: We present in this paper an algorithm for identifying satellites in DNA sequences. Satellites (simple, micro, or mini) are repeats in number between 30 and as many as 1,000,000 whose lengths vary between 2 and hundreds of base pairs and that appear, with some mutations, in tandem along the sequence. We concentrate here on short to moderately long (up to 30-40 base pairs) approximate tandem repeats where copies may differ up to * = 15-20% from a consensus model of the repeating unit (implying individual units may vary by 2* from each other). The algorithm is composed of two parts. The first one consists of a filter that basically eliminates all regions whose probability of containing a satellite is less than one in 10 4 when * = 10%. The second part realizes an exhaustive exploration of the space of all possible models for the repeating units present in the sequence. Thus it has the advantage over previous work of being able to report a consensus model, say m, of the repeated unit as well as the span of the satellite. The first phase was designed for efficiency and takes only O(n) time where n is the length of the sequence. The second phase was designed for sensitivity and takes time O(n N (e; k)) where k is the length of the repeating unit m, e = b*kc is the number of differences allowed between each repeat unit and the model m, and N (e; k) is the maximum number of words that are not more than e differences from another word of length k. That is, N (e; k) is the maximum size of an e-neighborhood of a string of length k.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the third kind of approach has none of the previous limitations but resorts to heuristics in order to find the repeats (Benson <ref> [1] </ref>, Leung [6] [9] and Rivals [13]). <p> Property 2: left u i+1 left u i 2 JUMP where left u is the po sition of the left-end of wagon u in s and JUMP = fxy : x 2 <ref> [1; max jump] </ref> and y 2 [min range; max range]g with the three parameters min range, max range and max jump chosen by the user. A prefix-model m is said to be valid if there is at least one train of m in the sequence s. <p> The basic idea behind the filtering step is that if there is a satellite m r where p = jmj, then in the dynamic programming matrix of s against itself, there should be a local alignment of length p (r i) centered on diagonal i p for i 2 <ref> [1; r1] </ref>. The similarity in these local alignments and the extent to which they lie on the given diagonal or at least near it, depends on the fidelity of the repeat units in the satellite. <p> For each potential period p of interest we compute the sum, S (p), of the values in all the cells in diagonals fp i + ffi : i 2 <ref> [1; bband=pc] </ref> and ffi 2 [w (p); w (p)]g where w (p) = maxf2; *pg. Effectively, we are taking the sum of the values in a 2 w (p) strip about each off-diagonal at period p, within the triangle. <p> The necessary recurrences are given in Lines 7 and 9 of the algorithm where we recall that JUMP = fxy : x 2 <ref> [1; max jump] </ref> and y 2 [min range; max range]g and i + JUMP denotes adding i to each element of JUMP. Observe that Rcnt [i] + Lcnt [i] is the length of the longest train containing a wagon whose left-end is at position i. <p> For example if s = AGAAAAAAA-GAATTTAGAAGAACAA, and the search parameters are e = 1, min repeat = 3, min range = 2, max range = 4, and max jump = 1, then G 0 for the model m = AGA consists of two components whose trains span the intervals <ref> [1; 12] </ref> and [16; 25]. For example, the left-end position sequences (0,3,6), (0,3,6,9), (3,6,9), (0,3,5,7,9), (0,2,5), (0,2,5,8), (2,5,8), (15,18,21), (15,17,19,21) among others are all valid train-occurrences. <p> Furthermore, it is also often the case that the models are permuted versions of one another, e.g. models AGA, GAA and AAG. The models covering a given span can also have different lengths, e.g. AGAA also covers the span <ref> [1; 12] </ref> above. It can also happen that one model is a power of the other. As an example, if the minimum number of repeats is lowered to 2, then both AGA and AGAAGA = AGA 2 are valid models, and we say that AGA is a root of AGAAGA. <p> Finally, Table 4 presents a summary of the satellite models found (all parameter sets considered together) that have a score above 100 under either of two different scoring schemes for the wrap-around dynamic programming fitness evaluation. Score 1 is that used by Benson <ref> [1] </ref> and scores matches, +2, and differences, 6. Score 2, of our own design, scores matches, +1, mismatches, 1, and indels, 2.

Reference-contexts: Such tandemly repeated units are divided into three categories depending on the length of the repeated element, the span of the repeat region, and location within the chromosome <ref> [2] </ref>. Repeats occurring in or near the centromeres and telomeres are called simply satel lites. Their span is large, up to a million bases, and the length of the repeated element varies greatly, anywhere from 5 to 100 base pairs.

Reference-contexts: Finally, one can further extend the model m to be what was called a weighted combinatorial cover over as in <ref> [15] </ref>, effectively permitting one to find repeated patterns including the class of limited-regular expressions [18]. <p> with 10,000 trials, we were able to get only 1 overlap with * at 10%, supporting our claim that the filter misses only 1 in 10 4 satellites at that fidelity. 4 Identifying the Satellites 4.1 Idea As in previous papers where a simpler form of models was used [14] <ref> [15] </ref>, satellite models are constructed by increasing lengths, that is, a valid prefix-model of length k + 1 is obtained from its prefix of length k.

Reference-contexts: Thus the total time taken by the algorithm is bounded above by O (n (jJUMPj+ e) max range N (e; max range)) = O (n max range 2 max jumpN (e; max range)) as e &lt; max range. We showed in earlier work, <ref> [16] </ref>, that N (e; k) is bounded from above by k e jj e . The space requirement is that of keeping all the information concerning at most max range models at a time (a model m and all its prefixes). <p> if s = AGAAAAAAA-GAATTTAGAAGAACAA, and the search parameters are e = 1, min repeat = 3, min range = 2, max range = 4, and max jump = 1, then G 0 for the model m = AGA consists of two components whose trains span the intervals [1; 12] and <ref> [16; 25] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Forgoing the first phase enables us also to deal with repetitions that are not tandem, and even allows us to take into account the presence of inverted repeats flanked by direct ones <ref> [17] </ref>. 2 Definitions and Statement of the Problem In all that follows, we let s be the DNA target sequence in which satellites are being sought. We assume that s is of length n and over the DNA alphabet = fA; C; G; T g.
