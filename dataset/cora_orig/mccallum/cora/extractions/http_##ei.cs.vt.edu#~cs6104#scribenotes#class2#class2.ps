Abstract: This class continued the review of number theory. We defined multiplicative functions, Euler's -function, and the Mobius function; we also stated the Mobius inversion formula. We introduced some notations relevant to the asymptotic growth rate of functions. Finally, we discussed formulae for approximating sums by integrals, approximating integrals by bounding error terms, and approximating sums of functions over primes.

Reference-contexts: Note that, in this one case, constant factors cannot be ignored. Example 3.3. Yet another way of stating the prime number theorem is as follows: (x) ~ log x 4 Approximation by Integrals 4.1 Euler's Summation Formula (Corollary 2.5.2) Theorem 4.1. Let f be continuously differentiable on <ref> [1; x] </ref>. Then X f (k) = 1 Z x (t btc)f 0 (t)dt: Here, k is an integer, and x is real. For a proof, see Corollary 2.5.2 in Bach & Shallit [1]. <p> Let f be continuously differentiable on [1; x]. Then X f (k) = 1 Z x (t btc)f 0 (t)dt: Here, k is an integer, and x is real. For a proof, see Corollary 2.5.2 in Bach & Shallit <ref> [1] </ref>. The first term represents the general approximation and the other terms compensate for the error incurred in the approximation. The general idea when using this formula is to calculate the approximation term and bound the error terms. Example 4.2.

(Theorem 2.5.3 in Bach & Shallit [1]) Consider the harmonic series, defined by: H n = 1kn k Scribe Notes for Algorithmic Number Theory Class 2|May 19, 1998 5 It is well known that this series diverges when n ! 1. <p> This integral can be bounded above as follows: Z 1 t btc Z 1 dt n Thus, H n = log n + fl + O 1 5 Asymptotic Approximation of Integrals Theorem 2.6.1 in Bach and Shallit <ref> [1] </ref> provides useful formulae for approximating the asymptotic behavior of certain integrals.
