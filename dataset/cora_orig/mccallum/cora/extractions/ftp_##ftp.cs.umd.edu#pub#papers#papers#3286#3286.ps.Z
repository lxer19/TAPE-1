Abstract: This paper discusses the design and implementation of interactive smooth zooming of a starfield display (which is a visualization of a multi-attribute database) and introduces the zoom bar, a new widget for zooming and panning. Whereas traditional zoom techniques are based on zooming towards or away from a focal point, this paper introduces a novel approach based on zooming towards or away from a fixed line. Starfield displays plot items from a database as small selectable glyphs using two of the ordinal attributes of the data as the variables along the display axes. One way of filtering this visual information is by changing the range of displayed values on either of the display axes. If this is done incrementally and smoothly, the starfield display appears to zoom in and out, and users can track the motion of the glyphs without getting disoriented by sudden, large changes in context.

Reference-contexts: Other databases exploit the starfield display by mapping two ordinal attributes along the axes and using a third to color code the dots. Additional attributes can be controlled by widgets such as sliders and buttons.

Reference-contexts: These query filters are implemented using widgets such as toggles for category and rating; Alpha Sliders <ref> [2] </ref> for the title, actors, actresses, director; a range selection slider [5] for movie length and a new widget called the zoom bar for varying the scale on the x and y display axes.

Reference-contexts: This gives users a feeling of flying through the data instead of getting disoriented by sudden large changes in view. As Bederson and Hollan affirm in their work on Pad++ sketchpad <ref> [3] </ref>, zooming 2 should be a first-class interaction technique. This paper deals with the design and implementation of zooming on a prototype dynamic queries application, the FilmFinder [1]. <p> For example, each node in a node-link diagram of a network may function as an icon of a sub network, so that zooming in would reveal the details of the sub network as another node-link diagram one rung lower in the hierarchy of networks - what is termed semantic zooming <ref> [3] </ref>.. This use of zooming is akin to magnifying an image at a selected point. The other use of zooming is to reduce visual clutter by filtering out data points that lie outside the new zoom range. The FilmFinder uses zooming to achieve the latter effect.

Reference-contexts: In either case, there is a sharp discontinuity at the boundaries, so users need to mentally integrate the two views. Ghostview, an X-Window application for viewing postscript files uses such a lens, as does the Magic Lens <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 2) With a fisheye lens [12], the selected object is magnified the most, and surrounding objects are progressively diminished in size, giving a perspective view that retains both the focus and the context.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Exploring large multi-attribute databases is greatly facilitated by presenting information visually. Then users can dynamically query the database using filtering tools that cause continuous visual updates at a rate of at least 15 frames per second <ref> [5] </ref>. Such dynamic query applications typically encode multi-attribute database items as dots or colored rectangles on a two-dimensional scatter gram, called a starfield display, with ordinal attributes of the items laid out along the axes. <p> These query filters are implemented using widgets such as toggles for category and rating; Alpha Sliders [2] for the title, actors, actresses, director; a range selection slider <ref> [5] </ref> for movie length and a new widget called the zoom bar for varying the scale on the x and y display axes. GLOBAL AND LOCAL EFFECTS OF VARYING ATTRIBUTES We distinguish query filters that have local effects and those whose effects are global.

Reference-contexts: A more challenging problem is to visualize a database containing 50,000 items. Such a visualization can be made by displaying a small number of representative rectangles <ref> [8] </ref> and zooming in to reveal the hidden ones - using zooming for its traditional purpose of revealing more detail. Handling such huge amounts of data would necessitate the use of linked data structures like k-d trees, range trees or quadtrees [11].

Reference-contexts: It changes the amount of information viewed within the focus area without changing the focus area size, and is identified as the canonical adjust operation in <ref> [9] </ref>. This has the advantage of uncluttering the screen, but if it is done in big discrete jumps, the user can feel disoriented. Any of these three zoom methods can be done either continuously or in discrete jumps depending upon the complexity of the image.

Reference-contexts: Handling such huge amounts of data would necessitate the use of linked data structures like k-d trees, range trees or quadtrees <ref> [11] </ref>. A 3-D display of rectangles might be an appealing alternative, but theres the danger of items obscuring each other and of the user getting lost in the startank.
