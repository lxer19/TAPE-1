Title: Slime: A new deformable surface

Abstract: Deformable surfaces have many applications in surface reconstruction, tracking and segmentation of range or volumetric data. Many existing deformable surfaces connect control points in a predefined and inflexible way. This means that the surface topology is fixed in advance, and also imposes severe limitations on how a surface can be described. For example a rectangular grid of control points cannot be evenly distributed over a sphere, and singularities occur at the poles. In this paper we introduce a new (G 1 continuous) deformable surface. In contrast to other methods this method can represent a surface of arbitrary topology, and do so in an efficient way. The method is based on a generalization of biquadratic B-splines, and has a comparable computational cost to methods based on traditional tensor product B-splines. This paper appeared at the British Machine Vision Conference, York, pp285-294 (1994).

Reference-contexts: For a detailed discussion of G 1 continuity see Farin [5] and references therein. In this section we briefly explain what we mean by G 1 continuity. Consider a curve given in parametric form f~r (u)ju*Dg. It is a mapping from a domain D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to a 3-dimensional curve. The tangent vector ~ t is given by d~r=du. When a composite curve is formed from two pieces, C 1 continuity is enforced by requiring that the tangent vector be continuous across the join. <p> BMVC 1994: A J Stoddart, Slime... 2 S-Patches In this section we present a very brief introduction to Bezier curves, Bezier surfaces and a generalization of Bezier surfaces called S-patches. The reader is referred to standard texts <ref> [1] </ref> for more details on Bezier curves and surfaces, and to Loop and De Rose [2] for more details on S-patches.

Reference-contexts: BMVC 1994: A J Stoddart, Slime... We believe that all existing methods fail on one or more of the above. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new deformable surface. We exploit a sophisticated new representation developed by Loop and De Rose <ref> [2, 3] </ref> for use in computer graphics. Our contribution is to add the dynamics that make it a deformable surface, and suggest a seeding algorithm. Deformable surfaces with fixed mesh topology are similar to elastic membranes or flexible plates. They may deform but cannot restructure their topology. <p> The reader is referred to standard texts [1] for more details on Bezier curves and surfaces, and to Loop and De Rose <ref> [2] </ref> for more details on S-patches. When discussing Bezier curves it is useful to replace the usual single parameter u with two parameters u 1 and u 2 and a constraint that u 1 + u 2 = 1. <p> Above we have presented mappings for 3-sided and 4-sided domains. How do you generalize to a mapping from an n-sided domain? This is a more difficult problem and an elegant solution was recently developed called the S-patch <ref> [2] </ref>. It both unifies and generalizes the Bezier triangle and the tensor product 4-sided Bezier patch. The trick is to map the coordinates of a domain point p = (u; v) in an n-sided domain D onto a Bezier simplex.

Our contribution is to add the dynamics that make it a deformable surface, and suggest a seeding algorithm. Deformable surfaces with fixed mesh topology are similar to elastic membranes or flexible plates. They may deform but cannot restructure their topology. <p> A major advantage of the B-spline is that by construction it joins together a number of Bezier curves or surfaces with C n continuity. BMVC 1994: A J Stoddart, Slime... Loop and De Rose <ref> [3] </ref> used the S-patch to build a generalization of the bi-quadratic B-spline surface that can describe arbitrary topology and is G 1 continuous everywhere. Due to space limitations it is not possible to include a full description of their surface, and the reader is referred to their papers. <p> It can be shown [5] that the tangent plane is continuous at all inter-patch boundary points in this construction. In other words the bi-quadratic tensor product B-spline is C 1 continuous. Loop and De Rose <ref> [3] </ref> show how to generalize the tensor product quadratic B-spline. In their scheme the control points form a mesh in which each vertex may have any number of edges coming from it, but all faces must have 4 sides. <p> The Sabin net for a 4-gon is identical to the 4 sided Bezier patch control points. The S-patch control points are depth 5, and are given as linear combinations of the Sabin net control points in <ref> [3] </ref>. This paper also contains a proof that the overall surface is G 1 continuous. The control mesh has another two less obvious requirements. The edges around each node must be sorted into a cyclic order in order to be passed to the stiffness or rendering routines.

Reference-contexts: An alternative solution [10] is to use non-conformal finite elements which have their own drawbacks. Both these methods have the inevitable topology problems associated with maintaining C 1 continuity. One final method that does comprehensively solve all the topological difficulties is Szelski's oriented particles <ref> [4] </ref>. The disadvantage is that it does not contain a surface representation. It contains only positions and normals at a finite set of points in space. 1.2 G 1 Continuity We wish to model free form surfaces made up of small patches or elements which join smoothly.

Reference-contexts: In practice many deformable surfaces enforce C 1 continuity across element boundaries, whereas we argue that it is sufficient to enforce the weaker requirement of G 1 continuity. For a detailed discussion of G 1 continuity see Farin <ref> [5] </ref> and references therein. In this section we briefly explain what we mean by G 1 continuity. Consider a curve given in parametric form f~r (u)ju*Dg. It is a mapping from a domain D = [0; 1] to a 3-dimensional curve. The tangent vector ~ t is given by d~r=du. <p> They satisfy the de Casteljau recurrence relation <ref> [5] </ref>, which can be used to compute position, and also perform depth elevation [i.e. generating a new set of control points of higher depth that gives the identical surface]. The boundary is a Bezier curve. <p> Each B-spline control point corresponds to a 4-sided tensor product Bezier patch. There are 9 Bezier control points for the patch, 4 are constructed as the midpoints of edges, 4 as centroids of faces, and the 9th is identical to the B-spline control point. It can be shown <ref> [5] </ref> that the tangent plane is continuous at all inter-patch boundary points in this construction. In other words the bi-quadratic tensor product B-spline is C 1 continuous. Loop and De Rose [3] show how to generalize the tensor product quadratic B-spline.

Reference-contexts: After some time, if _q ! 0 then we have found a local minimum of E. This formulation also has the advantage that it can be used for tracking <ref> [6] </ref>. We have computed this stiffness matrix for 3- and 4-sided patches and computation for the 5- and 6-sided patches is in progress. However in the meantime, to demonstrate the operation of the deformable surface, we have been succesfully using a much simpler stiffness matrix.

Reference-contexts: There is already a considerable Finite Element literature based on triangular elements [8]. It should be noted that there is an obscure but deep-rooted difficulty 1 in maintaining C 1 continuity for triangular elements <ref> [7] </ref>, which leads to the distinction between conformal and non-conformal finite elements. Two attempts have been made to build deformable surfaces based on C 1 continuous triangular elements.

Reference-contexts: Splines or finite elements typically represent curvature much more efficiently. Two representations in widespread use for geometric modelling, computer aided geometric design and deformable surfaces are tensor product finite elements <ref> [9] </ref> and tensor product B-splines. B-splines have been widely used in vision as active contour models or snakes. They have several very useful characteristics, as well as being fast and robust. Tensor product approaches are always based on an underlying rectangular grid of finite element nodes or spline control points.

Reference-contexts: We have implemented this scheme and find that it is very slow. Also, the mass matrix is non-diagonal and has negative eigenvalues. This means that it it has convergence problems.

Reference-contexts: Two attempts have been made to build deformable surfaces based on C 1 continuous triangular elements. McInerney and Terzopolous <ref> [11] </ref> solve the problem by using conformal finite elements with all partial derivatives up to 2nd order as nodal variables. We have implemented this scheme and find that it is very slow. Also, the mass matrix is non-diagonal and has negative eigenvalues. This means that it it has convergence problems.
