Title: A Neural Network for Attentional Spotlight

Note: and performs a critical task which cannot be accomplished by feedforward networks.  
Abstract: Technical Report AI91-165 Department of Computer Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712 Abstract According to space-based theory, visual attention is limited to a local region in space called the attentional field. Visual information within the attentional field is enhanced for further processing while information outside is suppressed. There is evidence that enhancement and suppression are achieved with dynamic weighting of network activity. This paper discusses a neural network that generates the appropriate weights, called the attentional spotlight, given the size and the position of the intended attentional field. The network has three layers. A shunting feedback network serves as the output layer leow@cs.utexas.edu, risto@cs.utexas.edu

Reference-contexts: After the J i 's have been switched off (i.e. J i = 0), the network gradually converges to an equilibrium state. The network given by Eq. 5 exhibits many interesting properties <ref> (Grossberg, 1973) </ref>. For example, the activity e i is always bounded between C and B regardless of the size of the input J i . The derivative _e i changes sign when e i reaches the bounds which prevents e i from getting beyond the bounds. <p> J i = P The type of the output function f (e i ) is critical to the performance of the network <ref> (Grossberg, 1973) </ref>. If f (e i ) is linear, the equilibrium relative activities (i.e. e i = P i e i ) will be identical to the relative inputs. <p> Then, a quenching threshold (determined by network parameters) exists such that relative activities below the threshold are quenched (become 0), and relative activities above the threshold are contrast-enhanced and sustained <ref> (Grossberg, 1973) </ref>. In our network, C = 0 and J i = b i , and equation (5) becomes: _e i = Ae i + (B e i )f (e i ) e i k6=i In this case, e i is bounded between 0 and B. <p> With this type of f (e i ), two critical values of relative activity determine the equilibrium state of the shunting feedback layer <ref> (Grossberg, 1973) </ref>. One of them is the fair distribution limit: if all relative activities are below this limit, then they will remain unchanged at equilibrium (effect of the linear portion of f (e i )). <p> Relative activities above this threshold (the central region of the spotlight) become uniform, whereas the sub-threshold relative activities (the boundary region) retain their original patterns. Since the fair distribution limit can be computed easily <ref> (Grossberg, 1973) </ref>, we use that as the lower bound for the partial uniformization threshold. In the simulations, this threshold is then adjusted upwards to obtain the desired shape for the spotlight.

Reference-contexts: To process large amount of visual information in a short period of time, the processes in a computer vision system need to be parallelized (Uhr, 1980; Feldman, 1985). However, complete parallelism is practically impossible because it would require an enormous amount of processors and connections <ref> (Tsotsos, 1988) </ref>. One solution is to process only a small portion of the data in parallel (through selective attention) and sequentially shift the parallel processing to other portions. There are two complementary psychological models of human visual attention.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the peaking effect observed in feedforward networks is avoided. A more detailed mathematical treatment of the network dynamics is given in the appendices. 4 Simulations The spotlight generation network was simulated numerically using forward Euler method <ref> (Wilson and Bowser, 1989) </ref> with t = 0:02. The threshold parameter r (of the threshold units, Eq. 2) was set at 0.5. Thus, the smallest spotlight is produced with I just above 0.5 (see Eqs. 1 and 3).
