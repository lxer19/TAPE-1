Abstract: This paper considers the problem of key agreement in a group setting with highly-dynamic group member population. A protocol suite, called CLIQUES, is developed by extending the well-known Diffie-Hellman key agreement method to support dynamic group operations. Constituent protocols are provably secure and efficient.

One promising approach to group fusion is a technique fashioned after the one developed by Steer et al. in <ref> [11] </ref>. In brief, suppose that two groups G 1 and G 2 currently using group keys K 1 and K 2 , respec tively, would like to form a super-group. <p> It is, thus, suitable for use as an IKA protocol. However, because of its symmetry 6 (no group leader) it is difficult to use it as a foundation for auxiliary key agreement protocols. Another DH extension geared towards teleconferencing was proposed by Steer et al. in <ref> [11] </ref>. This approach (STR) requires all members to have broadcasting facilities and takes n rounds to complete. In some ways, STR is similar to GDH.2 IKA. Both take the same number of rounds and involve asymmetric operation. Also, both accumulate keying material by traversing group members one per round.

In the first stage (n 1 rounds) contributions are collected from group members and in the second stage (round n) the group keying material is broadcast. <p> containing c N p are in the last Broadcast round of either member addition or member exclusion protocols: fg N i j M i 2 Cg We can further assume that Eve also knows all: fg S j S E g However, Eve's knowledge is a subset of what in <ref> [12] </ref> is called view (p; E ).
