Title: The Transitive Closure of a Random Digraph  
Author: Richard M. Karp 
Abstract: In a random n-vertex digraph, each arc is present with probability p, independently of the presence or absence of other arcs. We investigate the structure of the strong components of a random digraph and present an algorithm for the construction of the transitive closure of a random digraph. We show that, when n is large and np is equal to a constant c greater than 1, it is very likely that all but one of the strong components are very small, and that the unique large strong component contains about Q 2 n vertices, where Q is the unique root in [0,1] of the equation 1 - x - e -cx = 0. Nearly all the vertices outside the large strong component lie in strong components of size 1. Provided that the expected degree of a vertex is bounded away from 1, our transitive closure algorithm runs in expected time O (n). For all choices of n and p, the expected execution time of the algorithm is O (w (n) (n log n) 4/3 ), where w (n) is an arbitrary nondecreasing unbounded function. To circumvent the fact that the size of the transitive closure may be W(n 2 ) the algorithm presents the transitive closure in the compact form (A B) C, where A and B are sets of vertices, and C is a set of arcs.
