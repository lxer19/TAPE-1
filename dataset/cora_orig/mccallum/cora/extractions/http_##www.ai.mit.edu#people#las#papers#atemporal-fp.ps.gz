Title: An Atemporal Frame Problem  
Author: Lynn Andrea Stein 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Brown University  
Abstract: Given some change in the world, the frame problem is the problem of determining that most things in the world haven't changed. Since change is generally taken to mean "change over time," the frame problem is generally assumed to be a problem of temporal reasoning, and most examples of the frame problem are couched in terms of the effects of actions. In this paper, I point out the fallacy underlying this approach, and demonstrate something very much like the frame problem that is completely independent of time: the counterfactual validity problem. I show that this "atemporal frame problem" proves damning for certain approaches to solving the frame problem. However, exploration of the differences between these two problems may help to identify more promising research directions.

Reference-contexts: Many representations, beginning with McCarthy and Hayes's situation calculus [9], depend on the temporal locality of causality. Davis <ref> [2] </ref> explores spatial locality. A third difference comes from considering the qualification and ramification problems. As I indicated in section 4, actions can be qualified|the state of the world can interfere with their performance|while counterfactuals cannot.

Reference-contexts: Then, possible worlds that differ only in relevant ways are `nearer' than those that differ arbitrarily. Again, the key problem is relevance. How can we determine which changes are relevant to the counterfactual antecedent? Ginsberg <ref> [3, p. 42 ff.] </ref> gives a partial taxonomy of the ways in which two worlds can be similar. But, for the most part, research on the semantics of counterfactuals has focused on interpreting counterfactuals given some notion of relevance. <p> This approach relies only on keeping track of justifications and it is independent of the temporal structure used by many frame problem "solutions." Since it is an atemporal solution, it should work as well for the coun-terfactual validity problem. In fact, this possibility has been mentioned elsewhere <ref> [3, 4] </ref>; I pursue this approach in [14]. 7 Temporal counterfactuals are important for planning and plan recognition. By postu-lating alternate pasts or futures, they allow us to identify those that resemble the real (or desired) course of events, and to rule out the divergent ones.

Reference-contexts: There's a tension between qualifications|things that prevent actions|and ramifications, or things that actions change; determining whether something qualifies an action, or is changed by that action, is an important part of causal reasoning. Ginsberg and Smith <ref> [5, p. 316] </ref> suggest as an example a variation on the potato-in-the-tailpipe scenario: A potato in the tailpipe of a car is a qualification to the action of starting the car, while a potato in the tailpipe of a rocket will be blown to smithereens as a ramification of starting the <p> Because counterfactuals require that we accept their antecendents, whether they make sense or no, they force us to consider even wildly implausible scenarios, and to take into account potentially far-fetched and distant connections. Ginsberg and Smith make use of this property in their analysis of the qualification problem <ref> [5] </ref>. Finally, if we do find a solution to the frame problem that does not exploit these differences, we will also have solved, or at least made progress on, the counterfactual validity problem.

Reference-contexts: While the results of performing an action, including its success or failure, may be restricted by the state of the world when we perform it, the consequences of a counterfactual antecedent will always include the truth of that antecedent. 4 This is similar to an observation of Goodman's <ref> [7] </ref> about the meaning of counterfactuals. 6 5 Research Directions In demonstrating that the frame problem is analogous to the larger, and uglier, counterfactual validity problem, I may seem to be saying that solving the frame problem is a harder task than we might have believed.

Reference-contexts: While these solutions may indeed prove useful, it is unclear that their utility depends in any way on the reduction of the frame problem to that of counterfactual validity. For example, Morris <ref> [10] </ref> has proposed a solution to the frame problem that relies on a truth maintenance system, and which does not examine the counterfactual validity problem at all. <p> One such approach is the use of some sort of reason maintenance system to keep track of the changes made to the world. Morris <ref> [10] </ref> describes the use of a truth maintenance system for solving (or avoiding) the frame problem.

Reference-contexts: Because the frame problem is usually interpreted in the context of a change over time, the place of relevance is usually taken by causality. This point, which is common to most `solutions' to the frame problem, is perhaps best illustrated by the work of Shoham <ref> [11] </ref>. In fact, causality makes a very nice definition of temporal relevance. <p> The future is uncertain, and we may act to change it; while the past is fixed and immutable. This means that solving the temporal frame problem only requires looking at the world after the action in question. Shoham exploits this fact in his temporal theory <ref> [11] </ref>, which provides a polynomial-time computable procedure for solving the frame problem in certain `causal' contexts. A second difference between causality and general relevance follows from the physical nature of causality.

Reference-contexts: But proving these things is difficult. Ginsberg and Smith suggest an approach based on "maximal consistent subsets," or partial possible worlds, consistent with the change we're making. Their approach is completely syntactic, which results in certain problems; many of these were described and corrected by Winslett in <ref> [15] </ref>, where she gives a similar, but semantic, approach to the finding-the-nearest-possible-world problem.
