Abstract: Interconnect tuning is an increasingly critical degree of freedom in the physical design of high-performance VLSI systems. By interconnect tuning, we refer to the selection of line thicknesses, widths and spacings in multi-layer interconnect to simultaneously optimize signal distribution, signal performance, signal integrity, and interconnect manu-facturability and reliability. This is a key activity in most leading-edge design projects, but has received little attention in the literature. Our work provides the first technology-specific studies of interconnect tuning in the literature. We center on global wiring layers and interconnect tuning issues related to bus routing, repeater insertion, and choice of shielding/spacing rules for signal integrity and performance. We address four basic questions. (1) How should width and spacing be allocated to maximize performance for a given line pitch? (2) For a given line pitch, what criteria affect the optimal interval at which repeaters should be inserted into global interconnects? (3) Under what circumstances are shield wires the optimum technique for improving interconnect performance? (4) In global interconnect with repeaters, what other interconnect tuning is possible? Our study of question (4) demonstrates a new approach of offsetting repeater placements that can reduce worst-case cross-chip delays by over 30% in current technologies.

Reference-contexts: Current and future designs are generally interconnect-limited, and the available routing resource must be carefully balanced among signal distribution, power/ground distribution, and clock distribution. Table 1 reproduces several technology projections from the 1997 SIA National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors <ref> [1] </ref>. A notable deviation from the original 1994 Roadmap is that maximum on-chip clock frequencies will reach the gigahertz range even in the 180nm process generation. The implications of technology scaling particularly for system interconnect are very complicated.

Reference-contexts: if L2 switches simultaneously in the opposite direction, the driver of L1 sees only the grounded line capacitance. (In leading-edge processes, each neighbor coupling is of the same (and possibly greater) magnitude as the area coupling to ground.) The coupling factor or switching factor is often given in the range <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, and since most lines have two neighbors, the total coupling factor is in the range [0;4].

Reference-contexts: When lateral coupling capacitances are large, worst-case Miller coupling begins to dominate noise and delay calculations; this is alleviated by increasing the line spacing and/or adding shield wiring (i.e., wires connected to ground), with future techniques possibly including dedicated ground and power planes interleaved with signal layers <ref> [5] </ref>. 1 Another technique to reduce the lateral coupling capacitance is to interleave signal lines which do not switch at the same signal tran-sistion period.

Reference-contexts: Example considerations for a 7-layer metal (7LM) process might include: * Local interconnect layers (e.g., M1-M3) should generally remain at near-minimum dimensions and pitch in order to achieve routing density (for an example analysis of interconnect density in 0.25mm processes, see <ref> [10] </ref>). For short lines (e.g., several hundred microns or less), thinner metal offers less lateral coupling capacitance and driver loading, and thus locally improves circuit performance. At the same time, maximum wire width is limited by the aspect ratio upper bound. <p> 750 1250 1400 1600 2000 2500 # Wiring layers 6 6-7 7 7 7-8 8-9 Minimum contacted M1 pitch (mm) 0.64 0.46 0.40 0.34 0.26 0.19 Metal height/width aspect ratio 1.8:1 1.8:1 2.0:1 2.1:1 2.4:1 2.7:1 Table 1: Selected technology projections from the 1997 SIA NTRS. influence on vendors' processes <ref> [10] </ref>. Nevertheless, this topic has received very little attention in the literature, with only a small handful of high-level treatments available. 2 Our work is the first in the literature to attempt a wide-ranging study of interconnect tuning.
