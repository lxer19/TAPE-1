Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: The problem of speech recognition over telephone lines is growing in importance, as many near term applications of spoken-language processing are likely to involve telephone speech. This paper describes recent ef forts by the CMU speech group to improve the recognition accuracy of telephone-channel speech, particularly in the context of the 1994 ARPA common Hub 2 evaluation of speech over long-distance telephone lines. The greatest amount of work was directed toward determining a training procedure that provides the greatest recognition accuracy when the incoming speech is known to be collected over the telephone. W e compare the effectiveness of three training procedures, f inding that training using high-quality speech that is bandlimited to 8 kHz can achieve results that are as good as those obtained by training on speech of a similar bandwidth collected over actual telephone channels. We also compare the recognition accuracy of the SPHINX-II system using high-quality speech and telephone speech, and we comment on the reasons for differences in system performance.
