Abstract: For a site S (with enough points), we construct a topological space X (S) and a full embedding ' fl of the category of sheaves on S into those on X (S) (i.e., a morphism of toposes ': Sh(X (S) ) ! Sh(S)). The embedding will be shown to induce a full embedding of derived categories, hence isomorphisms H fl (S; A) = H fl (X (S) ; ' fl A) for any abelian sheaf A on S. As a particular case, this will give for any scheme Y a topological space X (Y ) and a functorial isomorphism between the etale cohomology H fl (Y et ; A) and the ordinary sheaf cohomology H fl (X (Y ) ; ' fl A), for any sheaf A for the etale topology on Y .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and statement of the theorem Many cohomology groups arising in geometry and topology are (or can be) defined as the cohomology groups of some topos; that is, as the sheaf cohomology groups of some site. This applies directly to etale and other cohomologies of schemes <ref> [1, 10] </ref>, but also to many others such as Galois cohomology [12] and cyclic cohomology [2]. <p> This applies, for example, to the presheaf topos ^ C on an arbitrary small category C , and to the etale topos associated to a scheme. In fact, any "coherent" topos has enough points (Deligne, Appendix to Expose VI in <ref> [1] </ref>). For any topological space X, the category Sh (X) of sheaves on X is a topos (with enough points), whose cohomology groups are the ordinary sheaf cohomology groups of X [3, 6]. We will prove the following result: Theorem. Let T be a topos with enough points. <p> and faithful embedding of derived categories D + (T ) ,! D + (X T ): The same argument applies to ringed topoi: if O T is any ring in T and D + (T ; O T ) is the associated derived category of complexes of O T -modules <ref> [1] </ref>, then ' fl induces a full and faithful embedding D + (T ; O T ) ,! D + (X T ; ' fl (O T )): The theorem, as well as the construction of the space X T , have been inspired by [8], where it is proved that <p> These methods cannot be applied to the topological space X T constructed here. 2 Construction of the space X T and of the map ' In this section, T denotes a fixed topos with enough points. Recall <ref> [1, 9] </ref> that the latter means that the functors p fl : T ! S, for all points p: S ! T , are jointly conservative. <p> By Lemma 5.4, the sheaf ' fl (I) U is ` Cech-acyclic' for each basic open set U ae X.

T vanish. <p> For an arbitrary sheaf B on X, R n ' fl (B) is the associated sheaf of the presheaf E 7! H n (' fl (E); fl (B)) (where : ' fl (E) ! X is the sheaf projection); see <ref> [1] </ref>, Proposition V.5.1 and [7], Lemma 8.18. <p> The main reference for this section is Grothendieck's Expose VIII in <ref> [1] </ref>. For basic properties of strictly henselian local rings and strict henselization, see [11]. Fix a ground field k, and a scheme Y (over k). Let Y et be the etale site over Y , and let f Y et be the associated etale topos. <p> The extension A ! A hs is a universal strict henselization of O Y in the topos f Y et . The sheaf A hs will play the role of the object G. The etale topos has enough points. We recall from <ref> [1] </ref>, Expose VIII, that each point y 2 Y defines first a geometric point y: Spec (k (y)) ! Y of the scheme Y , and then a point of the topos f Y et , whose inverse image functor is the composition ffi y fl : f Y et ! <p> By loc. cit., Corollaire VIII.3.6, the set of all these points is jointly conservative. So we can take this set of points y 2 Y for the set P. Consider again the extension A ! A hs in the topos f Y et . As explained in <ref> [1] </ref>, Expose VIII.4, for any y 2 Y the stalk map A y ! A hs y is a (the) strict henselization of O Y;y = A y , relative to the separable closure k (y) ,! k (y).

Reference-contexts: But often, there is a smaller and much more natural choice for G: the topos T will generally contain some "universal" structure U of a certain kind. For example, in the case of the etale topos, U is the universal strictly local ring <ref> [5] </ref>. More generally, if T is a classifying topos, U is the universal model for the theory classified by T (see [9], Chapter VIII). This object U will have the property required for G, namely that the subsheaves of finite products U fi fi U generate T . <p> The functor A hs on Y et which associates to f : Z !

The sheaf A hs will play the role of the object G. The etale topos has enough points.
