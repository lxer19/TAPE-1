Abstract: The timing-driven routing of a critical net can be implemented as a delay-bounded minimum Steiner tree. This routing tree has the path delays always limited no larger than a delay bound D, while the total wire length is minimized. The delay bound is usually specified at the system/logic design stage. The routing maintains this delay bound to guarantee the correct timing of the finally implemented system in physical layout. We propose a new algorithm of constructing delay bounded minimum Steiner tree. This algorithm is designed based on the observation that this tree can be obtained based on the trade-off between two other special types of Steiner tree: (1) minimum Steiner tree and (2) minimum path delay Steiner tree, by taking into account of a delay bound D. We also proposed a new algorithm of constructing the minimum delay Steiner tree. During the tree growing, the Elmore delay is incremently updated in constant time. These novel Steiner tree algorithms have been applied on a clock routing scheme for multi-chip modules based on area pad interconnections.

Reference-contexts: We propose a method of constructing the Elmore delay bounded minimum Steiner tree based on the trade-off of two special trees: (1) minimum path delay Steiner tree and (2) minimum Steiner tree. Since the routing in the IC chip is usually constructed in Manhattan wirings, we use Hanan grid <ref> [7] </ref> to construct rectilinear Steiner trees. Hanan grid is derived by extending a horizontal line and a vertical line through each sink and the source, as shown in Figure 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Obtaining T c is an NP complete problem. We employ an efficient method in <ref> [12] </ref> of constructing an approximation of T c . This method is a single partial tree growth algorithm each time a sink is connected. The partial tree starts at the source o and repeatedly calling Dijistra's shortest path algorithm to grow the partial tree to connect an unconnected sink. <p> So, the algorithm takes totally 6. Experiment Results 13 O (k 3 lg k) to connect k sinks. So, it is showed that the minimum Elmore delay Steiner tree algorithm has the same order of the time complexity of the minimum length Steiner tree algorithm in <ref> [12] </ref>. Suppose there are E c edges of T c and E d edges of T d . T b is the mixture of T c and T d , such that it has edge number E b E c + E d . <p> If T c and T d are optimum, T b should have less total edge length than T d and more total edge length than T c . But, since T c is obtained based on a approximation algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>, it is showed in Table 6.2 and Table 6.3 that l b is less than l c in most examples. For all these examples, t b D is satisfied. 14 7.
