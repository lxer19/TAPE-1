Abstract: KNOME is the user modeling component of UC, a natural language consultation system for the UNIX operating system. During the course of an interactive session with a user, KNOME infers the user's level of expertise from the dialog and maintains a model of the user's knowledge of the UNIX domain. KNOME's model of the user makes use of a double-stereotype system in which one set of stereotypes represents the user's expertise and another represents the difficulty level of the information. KNOME is used in UC to help: disambiguate the user's statements, avoid telling the user something that the user already knows, take advantage of prior user knowledge in presenting new information, and detect situations where the user lacks pertinent facts or where the user has a misconception. UC also models its own knowledge of UNIX with meta-knowledge (explicit facts about the limitations of the system's own knowledge hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh * This paper is a reprint from chapter 4 in A. Kobsa and W. Wahlster (Eds.), User Models in Dialog Systems, pp. 74-107, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1989. base), which is used to help in correcting user misconceptions.
