Abstract: It is widely reported in the literature that incremental clustering systems suffer from instance ordering effects and that under some orderings extremely poor clusterings may be obtained. In this paper we present a new general strategy aimed to mitigate these efects, the Not-Yet strategy, which has a general and open formulation and it is not coupled to any particular system. In addition, we propose a classification of strategies to avoid ordering effects which clarifies the benefits and disadvantages we can expect from the proposal made in the paper as well from existing ones. A particular implementation of the Not-Yet strategy is used to conduct several experiments. Results suggest that the strategy can improve the clustering quality and also that performance is limited by its local nature. We also show that, when combined with other local strategies, the Not-Yet strategy may help the system to get high quality clusterings. The observed benefits and limitations suggest future work under the proposed framework.

Reference-contexts: It is unclear how the proposed procedure scales to large datasets such as those typically referred to in data mining tasks <ref> (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro & Smyth, 1996) </ref>. However, we think that the Not-Yet strategy may be an inexpensive and effective way of avoiding ordering effects since it is unlikely that a whole large dataset would present a worst ordering case.

Reference-contexts: These operators can be viewed as providing some sort of backtracking capabilities to the system without having a memory of previous knowledge structures. A classical example of clustering operators are the merge and split operators of the COBWEB system <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref>. Finally, we can tackle with ordering effects using after clustering strategies. These strategies take an initial partition and try to improve it by iteratively making changes to the structure until some stopping condition holds. <p> This is a typical model of incremental clustering using a hill climbing strategy which estimates the goodness of applying the available operators and chooses the best option, not reconsidering any decision made so far. Particularly, this model corresponds to the one used in the COBWEB system <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref>. The measure of category utility used in this system is also used in the experiments as the CQF.

Reference-contexts: This work contains the basic ideas proposed here, but again the application is tuned for an specific system and the problems studied are deeply related to a particular clustering strategy. Although devoted to global methods, we have to mention relevant Fisher's work on iterative optimization of clusterings <ref> (Fisher, 1995) </ref>. This work explores several methods for iteratively improving clustering quality, showing that among these methods some exhibit an optimum performance. But recall that these methods operate reprocessing the whole dataset and violate the constraints stated for incremental clustering.

Reference-contexts: Thus, learning methods should be able of updating a knowledge base in a sustained, continual basis as new experience is gained. When the learning task is a clustering task, the learner's goal is to discover a conceptual structure underlying a set of given observations <ref> (Fisher & Langley, 1986) </ref>. If an agent performing a clustering task should be able of use its learned knowledge to carry out some performance task at any stage of learning, the conceptual scheme must evolve as every new instance is observed without simultaneously processing previous instances.

Reference-contexts: Our proposal is similar in spirit to that of Lebowitz, but we have clarified the terms and decoupled the formulation from any specific clustering system. 8 The second related work (from which the Not-Yet name is borrowed) is the application of this strategy to the LINNEO + clustering system <ref> (Roure, 1994) </ref>. This work contains the basic ideas proposed here, but again the application is tuned for an specific system and the problems studied are deeply related to a particular clustering strategy.
