Abstract: This study uncovers trading styles in the transaction records of US Treasury bond futures. It uses transaction-by-transaction data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions' (CFTC) Computerized Trade Reconstruction (CTR) records. The data set consists of 30 million transaction| the complete US T-bond futures market for 3 years. Each transaction record consists of time (by the minute), price, volume, buy/sell, and an identifier of the specific account. We use statistical clustering techniques to group together trades that are similar. Two sets of assumptions have to be made: (1) What is a trade? We define a trade to begin when an account opens a position, and to end when its position size returns to zero. We describe each trade by several trade-specific variables (e.g., length of trade, maximum position size, opening move, long or short) and several exogenous, market-specific variables (e.g., price, volatility, trading volume). (2) What process generated the data? We assume a mixture of Gaussians. An observed trade is interpreted as a noisy realization of one of the mixture components. This paper assumes identity covariance matrices. Furthermore, each trade is fully assigned to a single cluster. We compare this approach to diagonal and to full covariance structure with probabilistic assignments. Trade profit was held back in the clustering process. It turns out that the clusters differ significantly in their profit and risk characteristics. Using conditional distributions, we summarize features of profitable trading styles and contrast them with losing strategies. We find that profitable styles tend to hold trades longer, trade at higher volatility, and trade earlier in the contracts. We also show how some clusters uncover "technical" traders. Using the information about the individual accounts, the assignments of accounts to clusters are described by entropy, and the transitions of a given account through clusters is modeled by a first order Markov model.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to find similar trades and categorize them as one cluster. Clustering is the appropriate data mining technique for this task. It groups trades that are "close" to each other into clusters, and at the same time maximizes the differences among the clusters <ref> (Banfield and Raftery 1992) </ref>. Viewed from a probabilistic framework, we assume that the trades were generated by a finite mixture of distributions (Titterington, Smith and Makov 1985). Each distribution corresponds to a prototypical trade. Every observed trade is a noisy realization of one of these prototypes.

Reference-contexts: The 7 clusters listed in the table contain 99% of all trades. The remaining three have cluster sizes of 65, 5, and 3 respectively. We regard them as containing outliers and thus omit them from analysis. Figure 1 presents characteristic features of the clusters using Chernoff faces <ref> (Chernoff 1973) </ref>. Section 4.1 discusses two variables that are not included in the clustering: profit of the trade and the time until expiration. Section 4.2 discusses the trade-specific variables.

Reference-contexts: This study focuses on CTI code 4, corresponding to non-exchange members trading off the floor. This choice is based on the results that small speculators employ heuristic trading strategies that tend to exhibit more distinct trading styles than other groups <ref> (Lee, Shleifer and Thaler 1991, Heisler 1997) </ref>. Accounts with non-zero closing positions at expiration are excluded from the current analysis. Leakages may be caused by several factors, such as: actual delivery, exchange for physical, trades transferred from one account to another held by the same customer, or simply mis-entries.

Reference-contexts: Night trading hours are either 5:20 pm to 8:05 pm standard time, or 6:20 pm to 9:05 pm daylight savings time. Information from buyers and sellers is combined in the CTR data so that each transaction can be reconstructed by the minute <ref> (Manaster and Mann 1996) </ref>. 2.2 Feature Vectors The goal here is to analyze and understand trading behavior by clustering similar trades. This implies that the base unit of analysis has to be an individual trade.

A Gaussian distribution is parameterized by its mean and its covariance matrix. We estimate these parameters by maximizing the likelihood of data given by the model.

Reference-contexts: Table 2 summarizes the variables for each cluster. In conjunction with the table, we interpret the results on profit with Figure 2, a box plot representation of the cluster profit distributions. This plot complements the summary table by providing better visualization of the outliers <ref> (Tukey 1990) </ref>. While the overall sample considered here sustains an average loss per trade of USD 970, clusters 2, 4, and 5 do earn positive profits on average. The mean profits of cluster 2 and 4 are statistically significant, lying at least 2 standard deviations away from zero.
