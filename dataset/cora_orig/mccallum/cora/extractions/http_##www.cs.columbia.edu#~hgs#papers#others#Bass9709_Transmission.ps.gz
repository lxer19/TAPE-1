Abstract: The explosive growth of the Internet and the intranets attracted a great deal of attention to the implementations and performances of networked multimedia services, which involve the transport of real-time multimedia streams over non-guaranteed quality of service (QoS) networks. In this paper, we discuss some issues related to the transport of MPEG-2 streams over such networks by means of the most recent transport protocols compliant with the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). MPEG-2 encoded audio and video transmission is important for several applications including high quality video-on-demand as a part of information-on-demand and high quality video conferencing using the existing network infrastructures.

Reference-contexts: The program stream (PS) is intended for mostly error free environments. The transport stream (TS), on the other hand, addresses the needs of relatively error prone systems such as point-topoint, dedicated transmission systems for television program distribution, cable systems for set-top boxes, etc. <ref> [2] </ref>. The ubiquity of the Internet and the continuous increase in the computing power of the desktop computers together with the availability of relatively inexpensive MPEG-2 codec hardware in the form of computer plug-in boards have made MPEG-2 based, high quality video communications an interesting possibility for the desktop computers. <p> This packetization approach uses MPEG - 2 timing model which is based on MPEG-2 Program Clock Reference (PCR), Decoding Time stamps (DTS) and Presentation Time Stamps (PTS) <ref> [2] </ref>. The RTP timestamps are not used in decoding; however, they can be functional for estimating and reducing network-induced jitter and time drift between the transmitter and the receiver. Considering the sensitivity of the MPEG - 2 timing system to network jitter, this may prove to be a significant functionality.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 discusses the results from our early experiments. 2. RTP The services provided by the RTP include payload type identification, sequence numbering, time stamping and delivery monitoring. RTP typically runs on top of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [5] </ref> to make use of its multiplexing and checksum services. This is in addition to the basic networking services provided by the underlying IP layer. However, RTP may be used with other suitable underlying network or transport protocols.

Reference-contexts: A complete discussion of the RTCP is out of the scope of this paper; however, an understanding of its timing services is needed for explaining MPEG-2 transmission over RTP. In an RTP session, each sender transmits periodic RTCP packets that contain 64 bit Network Time Protocol (NTP) <ref> [6] </ref> timestamps, indicating the wallclock (absolute) time when the packet was sent. This information can be used in combination with timestamps returned in reception reports from other receivers to measure round-trip propagation to those receivers.

Reference-contexts: RTP PAYLOADS FOR MPEG Currently, three payload types are defined for the transmission of MPEG - 2 streams over RTP: 3.1 Payload Based on Encapsulated MPEG-2 PS and TS <ref> [7] </ref>: This payload type is established to accommodate for the hardware MPEG-2 codec implementations that operate directly on PS or TS. Systems using large existing data bases that are based on MPEG -2 PS or TS material may benefit from this payload type also. <p> The PSs are packetized as stream of bytes without any structure. 3.2 Payload Based on Separate Packetization of MPEG- 2 Audio and Video Elementary Streams <ref> [7] </ref>: This payload format is radically different from the previous case and takes advantage of the MPEG-2 video and audio stream structure to reduce dependencies among packets and to maximize the amount of decodable data at the receiver end.

Reference-contexts: For packets that contain only headers, the timestamp is that of the subsequent picture. There is no equivalent to MPEGs DTS and no explicit decoder buffer control mechanisms are defined. 3.3 Payload Based on Joint Packetization of MPEG-2 Audio and Video Elementary Streams (bundled MPEG format) according to <ref> [8] </ref>: This bundled packetization scheme is needed because it has several advantages over other schemes for some important applications including video-on-demand (VOD) where, audio and video are always used together. Its advantages over independent packetization of audio and video (Section 3.2) are: 1.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the HP data may be transmitted along with the A/V data using layered multimedia transmission techniques for RTP <ref> [10] </ref>. This approach can be used with all of the payloads defined above. However, in practice, using it with the TS encapsulation system requires significant processing at both the transmitter (to extract the HP stream) and the receiver (to construct the transport stream from the HP data) ends.
