Abstract: Advanced video applications need more support from a video server than most of today's video servers offer. These applications will include both the video, video related information (meta data), and other multimedia data types which will be shared between different applications and users. The video server should give better support for interactive applications and support multiple media formats and virtual video documents. Based on these requirements, we have designed and implemented the Elvira video server. The architecture is based on a cluster of workstations connected by a high speed network. The goal has been to build a video server which is highly efficient and scalable. To be able to experiment with different strategies for allocation of videos to the nodes in the server, the video server supports striping of videos across nodes and disks. A prototype of the video server is built running on a cluster of UNIX workstations which are interconnected by an ATM switch. In this paper, the design and implementation is presented together with some experimental results from the use of the video server.

Reference-contexts: Different architectures have been 260 proposed for building video servers. Two of the most frequently used architectures for video servers are cluster of workstations and massively parallel multiprocessors. Microsoft's Tiger <ref> [1] </ref> is based on inexpensive PCs interconnected by an ATM switch. SB-PRAM [9] is an example of a massively parallel processor used as a video server for Video-on-Demand. Much research has been on disk allocation and disk scheduling [5, 20]. <p> An example of the first strategy is SGI's server used in Time Warner's Orlando project [25]. Microsoft's Tiger uses the other strategy where the video is fragmented into fragments consisting of about one second of video <ref> [1] </ref>. These fragments are then allocated to the nodes in the server in a round-robin fashion. How to allocte video to disks and disk scheduling within one node has also been an important research area [19].

Reference-contexts: Television News on the Internet We are participating in the LAVA project to deliver television news on the Internet. This project is carried out in cooperation with the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, Norwegian Computing Center and NORUT IT. The purpose is to make television news available on the Internet <ref> [2] </ref>. Currently, we make the daily news program Nordnytt available to Internet users. After the news program has been broadcast on ordinary television, it is digitized and compressed into low quality MPEG-1 video and audio, and stored in the video server.

In addition to efficient storage and delivery of digital video, the following requirements were the foundation for the design of Elvira: * VCR support and frame accurate access The video server should support full VCR functionality, including single stepping and variable speed fast forward and backward. <p> VideoSTAR <ref> [13] </ref> gives a 263 conceptual data model for video and video information. In Elvira, we have extended the parts of this model relevant to the video server with necessary information for storage and delivery of virtual video documents. An ER-diagram for the catalog is presented in Figure 4.
