Abstract: This paper describes an algorithm for automatically adapting existing animated behaviors to new actors with different physical characteristics. When simulation is used for animation, this is a difficult problem because a control system that is tuned for one actor will not work on an actor with different limb lengths, masses, or moments of inertia. The algorithm presented here adapts the control system to a new actor in two stages. First, the control system parameters are scaled based on the size and moment of inertia of the dynamic models for the new and the old actors. Then a subset of the parameters is fine-tuned using a search process based on simulated annealing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we animate the running motion of a woman and child by modifying the control system for a running man. In addition to adapting a control system for a new model, this approach can also be used to adapt the control system in an on-line fashion to produce a physically realistic metamorphosis from the old model to the new model while the morphing model is performing the behavior. We evaluate the results of this approach by comparing the motion of the simulated child and woman with that of actual humans and data published in the literature.

Reference-contexts: The models that are created in this fashion have the same number of vertices and can be linearly interpolated to create a model for each frame of the animation. This simple algorithm for three-dimensional morphing is not as elegant as algorithms published in the literature (see, for example, <ref> [15] </ref>) but provides acceptable results because the polygonal models for the body parts are generally convex and because there is a close correspondence between the body parts of the man and the woman. The metamorphosis shown in figure 2 was performed over a 20 second period.

Reference-contexts: The local minima in this plot result from the fact that the optimization function combines a variety of criteria that together provide a high-level evaluation of a complex motion. In an informal evaluation of search techniques, simulated annealing <ref> [22] </ref> appeared to provide better results on this search space than Powell's method, a line-search technique, and so simulated annealing was used to tune the control system for the characters described in this paper. In both the case of the woman and child, the tuning process proceeded in stages.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers have realized that if generating motion directly is too difficult, perhaps we can adapt existing motion trajectories from procedural approaches, simulation, or motion capture to new situations <ref> [35, 7, 30] </ref>. Rose and his colleagues at Microsoft [25] use inverse kinematics, dynamic constraints, and optimization to blend between motion capture sequences for a three-dimensional human model.

Reference-contexts: A more appealing approach is automatic or semiautomatic design. One automatic approach treats the problem of generating motion as a trajectory optimization problem. Witkin and Kass <ref> [36] </ref> used this approach to control a jumping Luxo lamp. Cohen and Liu [9, 18] modified the optimization problem to have several windows thereby providing more control for the animator and reducing the time required for the optimization.

Reference-contexts: They used this approach to control a two link acrobot and a planar diving figure. Liu, Gortler, and Cohen [19] implemented a hierarchical wavelet-based version of spacetime constraints to allow finer detail where necessary without increasing the computation cost uniformly. Zhao and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania <ref> [37] </ref> represented the trajectory of the control variables as a spline and then optimized the locations of the control points for the spline. They used this approach to control a simple planar human figure performing a vertical jump.
