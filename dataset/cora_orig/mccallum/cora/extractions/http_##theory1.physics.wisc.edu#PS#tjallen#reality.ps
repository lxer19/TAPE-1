Abstract: We examine two methods for incorporating complex first-class constraints into the BRST formalism when the complex conjugates of the constraints are linearly dependent upon the constraints, as is the case for general relativity in the Ashtekar variables.

Reference-contexts: Attempts at constructing a quantum theory have ranged from Dirac's work on the canonical quantization of general relativity, through perturbative quantum field theory to supersymmetric string theory. The perturbative approach failed because general relativity, long known to be non-renormalizable, is not finite at two loops. <ref> [1] </ref> The canonical approach pioneered by Dirac did not fail as much as it simply came to an impasse because of the computational complexity of the quantum constraints. Supersymmetric string theory remains an exciting and viable candidate but it too has become a very involved edifice.

Reference-contexts: In 1986 there was surprising progress in the canonical approach to quantum gravity when Ashtekar published a canonical transformation of Einstein gravity to a new set of variables in which the quantum constraints are polynomial. <ref> [2] </ref> In the original work of Dirac, the constraints are not polynomial in the basic variables and, when quantized, become quite complicated, possibly pseudo-differential, operators. In the new variables, the quantum constraints are second order functional differential operators.

Reference-contexts: The constraints of general relativity simplify enough in the new variables that there are now solutions known to the full set of constraints. <ref> [3] </ref> Still missing from the quantization program are an inner product on the space of physical states and a full set of solutions to the constraints.

Reference-contexts: Between the time that Dirac developed his methods for quantizing constrained theories and the time that the new variables were found, a very powerful method for quantizing constrained theories was developed by Fradkin's Russian school <ref> [4] </ref> ; the BRST-BFV (Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin-Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky) method, or BRST method for short. Certain difficulties of Dirac's methods, such as operator ordering, are less severe in the BRST method.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the complex conjugates of the constraints together with the constraints themselves are together first-class. We have previously found a method for using complex constraints in the case that the complex conjugates of the constraints together with the constraints themselves are second-class. <ref> [5] </ref> 2. The Hermiticity of b in BRST quantization The BRST quantization of a Hamiltonian dynamical system with gauge symmetries provides a useful system for finding physical quantum states and removing unphysical states, those having zero or negative norm, from the spectrum.

Reference-contexts: This expanded system of constraints is inherently reducible and is dealt with using the reducible BRST method for BRST quantization of systems with reducible constraints that is so well explained by Henneaux and Teitelboim. <ref> [6] </ref> 4.1. Standard BRST treatment For our starting point, we consider a simple example of two abelian constraints G ffi 2 , 1 ; G ffi which are assumed to be real and bosonic. <p> That terms can be chosen such that is nilpotent has been shown by Henneaux. <ref> [6] </ref> The proof does not depend upon the reality properties of the dynamical variables.
