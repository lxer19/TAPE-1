Abstract: We propose to design, build and exploit for fundamental research an enhanced version of Thinking Machines' next generation machine with a peak speed of 1.6 Teraflops at a cost per megaflops of $16. This computer, to be completed at the end of 1996, will exceed 1 Teraflops sustained performance for a number of Grand Challenge problems, including QCD, will develop enabling technology, and should be viable as a commercial product.

Reference-contexts: All of the measurements listed below are crucial to the construction of realistic phenomenological models and to predictions of experimental signatures for plasma formation. In this section we summarize the principal goals of thermodynamics simulations on the Teraflops facility. Further details and more complete references can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. Scaling and T c . Light quarks make a significant difference in the character of the phase transition, so cannot be neglected in a realistic study of thermodynamics.

Reference-contexts: Thus one must extrapolate in a parameter describing the 35 asymmetry of the quark masses, and in the quenched simulations, this leads to a shift of a few percent. For dynamical simulations, the form of the extrapolation is different and may be more significant <ref> [14] </ref>. To check, the only recourse is an expensive calculation using a variety of dynamical quark masses. The current 10% accuracy on B K is enough to have significant impact on SM phenomenology. <p> Our plan at present is to begin running at fi ~ 6:5, with a series of volumes ranging between ~ 32 3 and the 128 3 maximum. Current work <ref> [14] </ref> indicates that on a 16 3 lattice at fi = 6:0, a pion of mass as low as ~ 500 MeV may be adequately treated without significant finite size distortions.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the perturbative calculations of renormalizations and operator mixings have been calculated for many quantities of interest, and these appear to be well under control. Some problems of principle do however remain. For example, as discussed by Maiani and Testa <ref> [42] </ref>, decays into two (or more) hadrons are exceedingly difficult to treat in Euclidean space except at the (unphysical) point where both hadrons are at rest. <p> If one calculates the direct K ! amplitudes, then the considerations of Maiani and Testa <ref> [42] </ref> apply, and one needs CPTh to relate the off-shell amplitudes with both 's at rest to the physical amplitudes. An understanding of the I = 1=2 rule, at least at the semi-quantitative level, will be required to give us confidence in any results for * 0 =*.

Reference-contexts: Results using Wilson fermions are less precise, but should improve, especially with the use of an improved action. The systematic errors in the lattice calculation of B K have been addressed to at least some degree. Finite volume errors are understood and are small <ref> [43] </ref>, and while finite lattice spacing errors are significant, they can be reliably extrapolated away [47]. By far the most significant source of uncertainty has to do with the quenched approximation and the chiral limit.

Reference-contexts: By far the most significant source of uncertainty has to do with the quenched approximation and the chiral limit. Some unquenched calculations have been performed, and these indicate that the effect of dynamical fermions is insignificant at currently accessible parameter values <ref> [44, 45] </ref>. The caveat is that the dynamical quark masses in today's simulations are typically about half the strange quark mass, and one cannot rule out the possibility that the effect may grow as the dynamical mass is decreased to the physical light quark mass.

Reference-contexts: This process is particularly interesting since it proceeds only through loop diagrams, and is therefore sensitive to properties of the top quark, and to new particles which appear in extensions of the SM. Two groups have recently made a first pass at the lattice calculation <ref> [54, 55] </ref>. In addition to all the usual caveats discussed above, the calculations suffer from uncertainties coming from the extrapolation from moderate quark masses up to the heavy b quark mass. As a result, the errors on these preliminary calculations are of the order of 30%.

Reference-contexts: Expressed in units of the rho meson mass the temperature of the crossover T c =m between the low and high temperature regime, extrapolated to zero quark mass, is roughly invariant as the lattice constant a is decreased or equivalently N t is increased over the range N t 8 <ref> [59] </ref>. However, in these same simulations, the ratio of the nucleon to rho meson mass is unphysically high. To achieve quantitative respectability, what is needed is a systematic analysis of the three limits: large volume, small lattice spacing, and small quark mass.

Reference-contexts: It is important to verify that this picture of the phase transition is not peculiar to the staggered fermion scheme. The alternative Wilson fermion scheme at present lattice sizes apparently suffers from lattice artifacts and requires a smaller lattice spacing before it can be compared with the staggered scheme <ref> [60] </ref>. To seek a consistent picture of the phase boundary may very well require the resources of a Teraflops machine. Thermodynamic and Hydrodynamic Parameters.

Reference-contexts: Particularly needed is a measure of the peak in the specific heat near the phase transition for simulations with dynamical quarks. Plasma Structure and Composition. Plasma structure and composition can be ascertained indirectly through measurements of such quantities as the baryon susceptibility and the baryon screening correlation <ref> [61] </ref>. Initial studies have suggested that the cooling of the plasma may result in an unusual abundance of baryons and antibaryons. This potentially important signature for plasma formation should be confirmed. Conclusions.

Reference-contexts: Studies of thousands of atoms require a three order of magnitude increase in computational speed, and Teraflops performance is needed to perform such studies. There are a variety of well established ab initio electronic structure methods <ref> [71] </ref>. The technique which best exploits the locality of the Schrodinger equation is the the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals-local spin density (LCGTO-LSD) method [72, 73, 74, 75].

Reference-contexts: The technique which best exploits the locality of the Schrodinger equation is the the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals-local spin density (LCGTO-LSD) method [72, 73, 74, 75]. This method expands the electronic orbital wavefunctions in terms of sums of Gaussian functions and then solves the local Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian <ref> [81] </ref> self-consistently. The localized spatial nature of the Gaussian basis function ensures that the Hamiltonian matrix elements decay extremely rapidly with distance and renders application of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian local with an interaction range less than about 6 A.

Reference-contexts: A recent example of a state-of-the-art ocean simulation, which has sufficient resolution to represent jets and eddies, is the "Community Modeling Effort" of Bryan and Holland <ref> [89] </ref>. It serves to illustrate the constraints imposed by the capacity of presently available computers. The model, developed at GFDL by Bryan and Cox [90] and further refined by Semtner [91], remains the leading and most widely used ocean model.

Reference-contexts: For example the effort to take the next step beyond the molecular scale into the "mesoscopic" scales in the molecular dynamics simulations will inevitably involve the use of similar coupled non-linear partial differential equations <ref> [99] </ref>. 6 Performance Analysis Several scientific applications have been studied as an integral part of the design process.

Reference-contexts: These systems are characterized by conflicting constraints and multiple (local) minima. For a prototype problem of this type, the groundstate structure of the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass, it was recently estimated <ref> [100] </ref> that by employing new multicanonical techniques on a Teraflops device definitive results can obtained. Similarly, the problems encountered in modeling the molecular basis of structural biology and the details of molecular recognition essential to rational drug design are very often beyond present computing resources.
