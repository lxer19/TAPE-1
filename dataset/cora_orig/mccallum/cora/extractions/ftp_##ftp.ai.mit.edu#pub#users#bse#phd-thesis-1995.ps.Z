Abstract: This paper describes a new statistical, model-based approach to building a contact state observer. The observer uses measurements of the contact force and position, and prior information about the task encoded in a graph, to determine the current location of the robot in the task configuration space. Each node represents what the measurements will look like in a small region of configuration space by storing a predictive, statistical, measurement model. This approach assumes that the measurements are statistically block independent conditioned on knowledge of the model, which is a fairly good model of the actual process. Arcs in the graph represent possible transitions between models. Beam Viterbi search is used to match the measurement history against possible paths through the model graph in order to estimate the most likely path for the robot. The resulting approach provides a new decision process that can be used as an observer for event driven manipulation programming. The decision procedure is significantly more robust than simple threshold decisions because the measurement history is used to make decisions. The approach can be used to enhance the capabilities of autonomous assembly machines and in in quality control applications. c fl Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1995

Reference-contexts: The index probability, and the associated summation, is what makes this approach difficult. For 3 eigenvectors of size 6 there are 3 = 20 possible indices. The index probability can be computed from the asymptotic normal statistics of the eigenvalues 166 Chapter 8: Constraint Estimation given in <ref> [ Anderson, 1984 ] </ref> . The index probability is the probability that the selected eigenvalues fall in the given order given the uncertainty in their estimates. If the data is sufficiently rich such that only one of these probabilities is relevant then the test is very fast.

Reference-contexts: In segment based approaches to computer perception of speech, the first step is to roughly segment the observered signal into phonemes. <ref> [ Andre-Obrecht, 1988 ] </ref> looked at segmenting the speech signal using an autoregressive model for the measurements and three different change detection algorithms. The change detection algorithms are similar to the one discussed here.

Reference-contexts: Sequential hypothesis tests, originally developed by Wald [ Wald, 1947 ] , are used for on-line segmentation of the measurement processes into a sequence of measurement models. The second important thread comes from dynamics in configuration space <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983, Arnold, 1989 ] </ref> . Configuration space is the space of all possible generalized coordinates, or configurations, for the moving robot. Manipulation and mating are processes which are best modeled as motions in configuration space. The contact forces in manipulation are configuration space constraint reaction forces. <p> Additional background on this chapter's treatment of configuration space and deterministic dynamics can be found in books on advanced classical mechanics. A very readable treatment of the methods of mathematical classical mechanics including manifolds, tangent bundles, cotangent bundles, and forms from a physics viewpoint is given by <ref> [ Arnold, 1989 ] </ref> . An introductory mathematics text on this material is [ Munkres, 1991 ] . The structure of the dynamics and the sensor measurements in configuration space creates a natural framework in which to construct a feature observer.

Reference-contexts: Each node in the graph has been labeled by the featuring pairings that are active at that graph node. This graph has been called the graph of assembly process states or the contact states in <ref> [ Asada and Hirai, 1989 ] </ref> . For non-convex objects, such as peg-in-hole assembly problems, the connectivity is significantly more complicated than the graph shown. In either case, the graph shows the possible contact transitions and is invariant to changes in the reference point.

Reference-contexts: This approach is important because it provides a formal problem statement and approach for fine manipulation programming. This approach directly incorporates uncertainty. It showed how both contact constraints and sensing could be used to reduce uncertainty. This formulation of the control problem is very close to stochastic dynamic programming <ref> [ Bertsekas, 1976 ] </ref> and shares the problem of dimensionality. One approach to solving the problem is to discretize the task state space and then consider sequences of motions and sensing operations in the discretized state space. <p> Of course, the size of the state space is typically exponential in the degrees-of-freedom, or dimension, of the state space. Things become more complicated when there is uncertainty. But, there is a classic information reduction which places the problem with uncertainty into the path planning problem presented above <ref> [ Bertsekas, 1976 ] </ref> . With uncertainty everything becomes set valued.

Reference-contexts: This section presents some of the more recent approaches to the problem of fine motion programming with uncertainty and shows how this thesis relates to that work. 2.1.1 Guarded Moves Guarded moves <ref> [ Bolles and Paul, 1973 ] </ref> is the earliest approach to fine motion programming. A guarded move is a motion which terminates when a force or position limit of a certain value is crossed. A branching control strategy can be written by combining primitive motions with guarded move termination tests.

Reference-contexts: Some research has looked at the information that can be acquired by actively moving the contact sensor and monitoring both the sensor and joint locations. This is termed haptic sensing. Prior haptic research has primarily focused on actively tracing the contours of objects to determine geometry and critical features <ref> [ Brock and Chiu, 1985, Stansfield, 1987 ] </ref> . This work assumes that each measurement is taken with the force sensor in a quasi-static state so that normal forces and contact locations can be computed.

Reference-contexts: However, in this case since only a small number of states are stable, the dimensionality of the problem is tractable. A close dual to the sensorless manipulation problem can be found in <ref> [ Brock, 1993 ] </ref> . Brock considers the problem of determining the configuration of an object through a sequence of sensing operations.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm which observers the measurements to detect contact events, or to determine the contact state is a contact state observer.

Reference-contexts: In this example there are only two degrees-of-freedom that can have errors (because of fixturing). The number of possible conditions increases rapidly with the dimension of the underlying space. As part of his thesis <ref> [ Buckley, 1987 ] </ref> determined the number of force or position distinguishable contacts for a three dimensional square peg in a square hole. This study showed that there are 1714 possible contact pairings that could occur. Case by case analysis of the possible situations is impossible without computer aid. <p> Primitive contact pairings between objects in the environment were defined as atoms in <ref> [ Buckley, 1987 ] </ref> . This same representation was used in [ McCarragher and Asada, 1993a ] . <p> The contact constraint models can be extended to incorporate friction and this in essence makes the friction cone normal depend upon the configuration. Our definition of a feature can be contrasted with an alternative concept of disam-biguous sets <ref> [ Buckley, 1987 ] </ref> . We will discuss the complementary sets the confuseable sets and restrict our attention to partitions of the configuration space. The argument also applies to phase-space.

Reference-contexts: This idea is very important for parts orienting and fixturing in manufacturing using vibratory bowl feeders or other similar systems. A good review of this work, and applications of using the constraints of shape to filter out and design the required function can be found in <ref> [ Caine, 1993 ] </ref> . This approach can be placed in the preimage framework. Since the manipulations are sensorless, the information vector is just I j = fu j 1 g and the interpretation update is Planning still proceeds over the power set of the state space. <p> For example, a Phillips screw and screw driver produce the same constraint surfaces as a flathead screw and screwdriver for (z; ) motions (Figure 4.6). Several examples of this are given in <ref> [ Caine, 1993 ] </ref> . Some mechanisms also have this property. contacts. These contacts, except for the limited range of motion, are equivalent to a mechanism with two sliders as shown. Each contacting vertex can be considered as attached to a slider aligned with the edge through a pivot. <p> Forward 94 Chapter 5: A Contact Feature Model strategy for a point robot in a two dimensional configuration space. 5.3: Encoding Tasks with Features 95 projection of point sets in configuration space was addressed in the plane with rotation in <ref> [ Caine, 1993 ] </ref> . These algorithms could be applied to computing the forward projection graph. We suggest, but have not implemented, the following Monte Carlo approach which does not require representing C-space explicitly.

Reference-contexts: This is done formally by incorporating forward and back projection. It should be noted that computation of time projection of sets is a very hard task in general, and that the additional information being provided here by the action dependence is substantial <ref> [ Canny, 1987 ] </ref> . In addition, the geometric parameters estimated for the constraint feature contain information about the pose of the contacted objects. The estimates of these parameters could be used to update an estimate of object configuration. <p> Furthermore, McCarthy's exposition shows how the constraints of kinematic mechanisms can be uniformly represented in terms of vector quadratic equations. This representation might simplify the derivation of results equivalent to the polygonal contact results. Constraint representation based on quaternions is also used in <ref> [ Canny, 1987 ] </ref> . A more general representation is needed for bodies with complex geometries or compliant surfaces. The stiffness estimation procedure combined with a smoothing algorithm may provide such an approach.

Reference-contexts: Although highly effective for repetitive problems, such as assembly, the approach may not be able to deal with less structured problems because in general the forces depend upon the commands sent to the robot.

As part of this work he developed some tests for segmenting the motion data into section that come from a single contact configuration. <p> To quote from his thesis: The implementation of the methods in this work requires further devel opment in the following areas: * ... * develop the necessary checks and implementation to allow for parallel estimation and identification of alternative touching configura tions; * ...

Reference-contexts: Of course, this implies that fixed normal model of friction is not a feature in configuration spaces with curved surfaces. The fact that sensor noise can destroy transitivity in the definition of confuseable sets was recognized in <ref> [ Donald and Jennings, 1991 ] </ref> . Their work defined a configuration space perceptual equivalence sets in a manner similar to disambiguous sets. The essential difficulty is that ambiguity or disambiguity is too strong a constraint to place on the problem.

Furthermore, the feature primitives are placed into a single framework which can be used for manipulation. In an earlier paper <ref> [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1993 ] </ref> , we showed how intrinsic contact sensing could be used to detect changes in the spectral signal characteristics of the contact wrench. Greater detail on this approach is contained in [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1994 ] . <p> The predefined models are created off-line from hand segmented training data. Signal description is regression against a set of model classes so as to best describe the signal over the classes. This chapter discusses labeling. Signal segmentation and description is discussed in previous papers <ref> [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1993, Eberman and Salisbury, 1994 ] </ref> . A simple change detection based segmentation procedure was used to produce the training samples for labeling. Both problems require estimators to compute the likelihood of a model. In labeling, estimators incorporate prior knowledge of parameters in computing model likelihoods.

Reference-contexts: In an earlier paper [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1993 ] , we showed how intrinsic contact sensing could be used to detect changes in the spectral signal characteristics of the contact wrench. Greater detail on this approach is contained in <ref> [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1994 ] </ref> . Chapter 7 covers some aspects of this work. <p> For our purposes, the simple alternative hypothesis that the change in is reflected in a change in magnitude of the covariance seems to suffice. More sensitive tests which involve estimating the direction of change can also be applied <ref> [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1994 ] </ref> . Therefore, our alternative hypothesis H 1 is that -(n) ~ N (0; q ^ V (n)), where q is the user selected change in variance. <p> Increasing T decreases the false alarm rate and increases the time to detection. Determing both of these relationships requires solving a first passage problem. Closed form solutions to this type of problem are rare and difficult to derive. Approximations for some simple cases are discussed in <ref> [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1994 ] </ref> . 6.3: Estimating the Current Feature Parameters 107 In particular, the Page-Hinkley (PH) test can be compared to the very popular method of filtering followed by thresholding. <p> The predefined models are created off-line from hand segmented training data. Signal description is regression against a set of model classes so as to best describe the signal over the classes. This chapter discusses labeling. Signal segmentation and description is discussed in previous papers <ref> [ Eberman and Salisbury, 1993, Eberman and Salisbury, 1994 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The problem is further simplified by showing that the continuous set of actions fall into a finite number of action classes based on which of the finite outcomes they allow. For example, a tray tilting planner was devised in <ref> [ Erdmann and Mason, 1988 ] </ref> based on the observation that a polygonal object could only come to rest in a finite number of orientations when it fell against a wall.

Reference-contexts: This step is essentially computing controls that connect any two states. If this connectivity is memorized, a k step path can be computed in order O (k card (U ) card (X ) 2 ) <ref> [ Erdmann, 1989 ] </ref> . In particular, the problem has polynomial complexity in the size of the state space. Of course, the size of the state space is typically exponential in the degrees-of-freedom, or dimension, of the state space. Things become more complicated when there is uncertainty. <p> in [ Hager, 1992 ] . 2.1.6 Probabilistic or Randomized Strategies Probabilistic or randomized strategies can help the planning and manipulation problem by: 1) removing the requirement that every step in the plan be guaranteed to be recognizable, and 2) preventing infinite control looping caused by model or control error <ref> [ Erdmann, 1989 ] </ref> . At the simplest level, a randomized strategy is just a random walk on the state space of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Different contact types have different grasp properties which affects stability [ Sal-isbury, 1982 ] . In addition, the local contact normal and curvature provide a strong pruning heuristic rule for identifying objects and object pose <ref> [ Grimson, 1990 ] </ref> . Local object curvature can be measured passively by examining the normal contact force distribution. * Determining the surface texture at each contact. Surface texture affects grasp stability. Rough textures are generally easier to grasp then smooth textures.

Reference-contexts: Optimality of the GLR test has been investigated under many different conditions, one useful reference is [ Zeitouni et al., 1992 ] . An alternative test, which can be computed sequentially, is developed in <ref> [ Hall, 1985 ] </ref> . 6.3: Estimating the Current Feature Parameters 103 Our path scoring algorithm is based on the Viterbi algorithm for Hidden Markov Models (HMM). <p> At a fixed false alarm time, an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio will decrease the time to detection. The performance of the alternative test of lowpass filtering followed by thresholding can be bounded using the following asymptotic approximation derived by Hall <ref> [ Hall, 1985 ] </ref> . The approximations are valid in the limit of an increasing threshold and short sampling time.

Reference-contexts: For unstructured manipulation this level of perception is not sufficient. Uncertainty, noise, and the range and frequency of contact events makes observing the contact state difficult. More powerful statistical tools are needed to formulate and solve the observer problem. 15 Hannaford's <ref> [ Hannaford and Lee, 1991 ] </ref> use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is one of the few formulations of the observer as a statistical decision problem. They modeled the sequence of forces that occur during a given manipulation using a HMM for the force. <p> This allows for correlated measurements within each state in the graph. The best tutorial on the HMM model is in [ Rabiner, 1989 ] . The HMM model was applied to contact perception in <ref> [ Hannaford and Lee, 1991 ] </ref> . An approach similar to ours for dynamic systems is presented in [ Tugnait and Haddad, 1979 ] . <p> Adding these unloading transitions also improves performance. This information can really only be gleaned either from a really good simulation or from actual measurements. In the HMM approach to both speech and force processing <ref> [ Hannaford and Lee, 1991 ] </ref> the transitions are learned from repeated trials using the EM algorithm. A similar approach should be applicable here and would significantly enhance robustness for repeated tasks. With these additional connections, 20 experimental trials from 57 under action 1 were correctly marked.

Reference-contexts: This is also termed the object's configuration. The generalized force is the force or torque on each of the generalized directions. 3.3: Previous Work on Intrinsic Contact Sensing 47 3.3 Previous Work on Intrinsic Contact Sensing During the last decade, considerable research has been performed on tactile sensing. <ref> [ Howe and Cutkosky, 1991 ] </ref> provides a recent comprehensive review of current and past research. Most of this research has focused on designing surface array sensors and using these sensors for obtaining geometric information from static measurements. <p> All of this work essentially treats sensing with a tactile array sensor as a primitive form of vision. In contrast, only recently have investigations examined contact information that is characteristic of the physics of motion <ref> [ Howe and Cutkosky, 1991 ] </ref> . Mechanical properties of objects like mass, friction, and damping can only be determined by actively probing and manipulating the object. Similarly, detecting the initial contact with an object, and slip between the sensors and environment require sensing the effects of relative motion.

Reference-contexts: Then the peg is approximately aligned with the hole. Finally, an insertion step is used to push the peg into the hole. Multi-step strategies also occur in grasping. As an example consider the experiment of grasping, lifting, and replacing an object of unknown mass given by <ref> [ Howe et al., 1990 ] </ref> . In their paper, the sensors measured fingertip forces, accelerations, and relative slip while a two finger grasper was used to grasp, lift, and replace a single test object. <p> Since there can be multiple outcomes in any given interaction branching and context based decision making is always necessary. Multi-step strategies also occur in grasping. As an example consider the experiment of grasping, lifting, and replacing an object of unknown mass given by <ref> [ Howe et al., 1990 ] </ref> . An idealized version of this task is shown in figure 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Both difficulties can be partially circumvented by limiting the state space by supplying a nominal path. Another approach to creating a finite set on which to reason is landmark based planning as presented in <ref> [ Lazanas and Latombe, 1992 ] </ref> . This paper shows that the original motion planning problem of finding a guaranteed plan despite uncertainty can be solved in polynomial time if state space is inhabited by regions called landmarks and the goal in one of the landmarks.

Reference-contexts: Under closed-loop torque control, this system is able to control the forces to 1 part in 500 with very little internal vibration. The motor's design and control is described in <ref> [ Levin, 1990 ] </ref> . The second device mounted the fingertip sensor on the PHANToM.

Reference-contexts: Because we start from a statistical representation, we are able to utilize the powerful tools that have been developed for stochastic measurement processes. Maximum likelihood estimation <ref> [ Ljung, 1983 ] </ref> is used for extracting the feature parameters. Sequential hypothesis tests, originally developed by Wald [ Wald, 1947 ] , are used for on-line segmentation of the measurement processes into a sequence of measurement models.

Reference-contexts: Each skeleton was intended to provide for a range of examples of a task. A few skeletons would then suffice to make the robot capable in a given task. The problem is that small changes in geometry can necessitate large changes in strategy <ref> [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984 ] </ref> . Therefore, a single task such as peg-in-hole insertion may require a many skeletons. <p> Instead, a technique for directly incorporating geometry and a model of the errors is needed for task programming. 2.1.4 Fine Motion Planning Preimage fine motion planning deals with error and the effects of geometry by planning over models of the error and geometry <ref> [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984 ] </ref> . In this formal approach, robot programming is treated as an automatic program synthesis problem given knowledge of geometry, physics, and sensing. The programmer writes a single program called a planner. <p> Therefore, any two points selected from the same power set partition can both reach exactly the same partitions and are therefore equivalent under a single action. uncertainty for generalized damper control <ref> [ Lozano-Perez et al., 1984 ] </ref> . Generalized damper control only tracks the velocity command. The position is not used in the control law. Under this model of control, the path of the robot starting from any point will lie in a cone emanating from the point.

Reference-contexts: However once the robot is certain the peg is in the hole and beyond the jamming depth, a simple compliant insertion will suffice to complete the task. 2.1.3 Strategy Skeletons The first idea for removing some of the burden from the programmer was to write a set of strategy skeletons <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1976, Taylor, 1976 ] </ref> which would be available as robot programming primitives. There would be a skeleton for maintaining grasp, a skeleton for inserting two parts, a skeleton for opening a door, et cetera.

Reference-contexts: Sequential hypothesis tests, originally developed by Wald [ Wald, 1947 ] , are used for on-line segmentation of the measurement processes into a sequence of measurement models. The second important thread comes from dynamics in configuration space <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983, Arnold, 1989 ] </ref> . Configuration space is the space of all possible generalized coordinates, or configurations, for the moving robot. Manipulation and mating are processes which are best modeled as motions in configuration space. The contact forces in manipulation are configuration space constraint reaction forces. <p> Type A is contact between an edge on the moving polygon and a vertex on the fixed polygon. Type B contact is contact between a vertex on the moving polygon and an edge of the fixed polygon ( 4.2: Kinematic Constraints 55 between two polygons. Figure from [Caine 1993]. <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983 ] </ref> ). Contact between two vertices is a limiting case of contacting two edges. Contact between two edges can also be treated as two contacts. Both cases will be considered in the next section. Because polygons consist of straight lines, the configuration space obstacles are ruled surfaces.

Reference-contexts: The parameter estimates depend upon the model order because in general the vectors fs i (n)g are not orthogonal. An orthogonal set of parameters, sometimes termed the reflection coefficients <ref> [ Makhoul, 1975 ] </ref> , can be formed by first orthogonalizing the vectors fs i (n)g. The orthogonal parameters can then be used to estimate for any desired order. When the computation is performed on-line only I (n) and X (n) are actually kept in memory.

Reference-contexts: For example, polygonal parts can be oriented by pushing on them with a stick. An early proponent of this approach was Mason in <ref> [ Mason and Salisbury, 1985 ] </ref> . Only certain orientations will be stable, and the rest will be filtered out by the act of pushing. This is an example of sensorless manipulation. Sensorless manipulation relies on the task physics to accomplish the task without any sensing except for a clock.

Reference-contexts: The relationship of compliance specifications to geometric constraint was formalized in <ref> [ Mason, 1981 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Second, once a set of controllers is developed, the domain of each controller must be determined. For feedback controllers, without information state, the domain is the region of state space over which the controller should be applied. In the subsumption architecture, the domain is arbitrated through behavior suppression. <ref> [ Mataric, 1994 ] </ref> used reinforcement learning to determine the suppression rules given a set of real sensors.

Reference-contexts: Brooks [ Brooks, 1985, Brooks, 1987 ] argues for an implementation called the subsumption architecture. Howe and Cutkosky use event transitions, which they term contact events, to drive their grasping algorithm. Another work <ref> [ McCarragher and Asada, 1993a ] </ref> focused on the transitions to drive an assembly algorithm. This mixed approach of continuous control within discrete domains or contexts is very appealing. It breaks the problem down into components which can then be solved in isolation. <p> Primitive contact pairings between objects in the environment were defined as atoms in [ Buckley, 1987 ] . This same representation was used in <ref> [ McCarragher and Asada, 1993a ] </ref> . In order to incorporate the notion of sensor separation, Buckley defined two atoms as being disambiguous if the sensors (force and position) could distinguish the two atoms with a single reading from the sensors. <p> Only changes in feature vectors need to be processed by the geometric part of the observer in order to determine the new contact state. This significantly reduces the computational load. 42 Chapter 2: Manipulation Programming The problem of building an observer based on force measurements was also considered in <ref> [ McCarragher and Asada, 1993a ] </ref> . They used a Petri net to model the different contact conditions and possible transitions for known geometry. Transitions were detected using transient contact force features. The approach did not check the consistency of the forces with the current contact state.

Reference-contexts: Brooks [ Brooks, 1985, Brooks, 1987 ] argues for an implementation called the subsumption architecture. Howe and Cutkosky define the events by the measurements generated as the robot transitions between manipulation phases. They used these events to drive their grasping algorithm. Another work <ref> [ McCarragher and Asada, 1993b ] </ref> focused on the transitions to drive an assembly algorithm. In most of the previous work, the contact state observer has taken the form of a set of thresholds. For unstructured manipulation this level of perception is not sufficient.

Reference-contexts: For example, the location of a vertex is specified by its coordinates in the object frame. The location of an edge can be given by the outward normal of the line body when these terms are represented as screws <ref> [ McCarthy, 1990 ] </ref> . We are using these terms for any generalized force and velocity to avoid confusion with the force and velocity of a point mass. 54 Chapter 4: Manipulation and Constraints supporting the edge and the distance to the edge. <p> In addition, the representation of configuration breaks down. The first problem can be potential solved by treating both the tangent and cotangent spaces equally and then enforcing the reciprocity condition through a Lagrange multiplier. The second problem might be solved by changing to a representation based on the dual-quaternion <ref> [ McCarthy, 1990 ] </ref> . This approach was used for linear constraints with the trace criterion. Since quaterions represent the rotation implicitly, the problem of representational singularity that occurs in an angle based representation does not occur.

An introductory mathematics text on this material is <ref> [ Munkres, 1991 ] </ref> . The structure of the dynamics and the sensor measurements in configuration space creates a natural framework in which to construct a feature observer. Motions in configuration space give rise to contact models, namely: 1) impacts, 2) constraints, and 3) velocity dependent characteristics of the noise.

Reference-contexts: This has produced several areas of work: sensorless manipulation, probabilistic manipulation, planning with feedback, reactive behaviors, and landmark based planning. Finally after discussing these approaches we discuss a new approach, Local Control about a Nominal Plan (LCNP), <ref> [ Narasimhan, 1994 ] </ref> , to which this thesis directly relates. 2.1: History of Fine Manipulation Programming 35 2.1.5 Sensorless Manipulation The constraints imposed by contact can be used to decrease uncertainty. For example, polygonal parts can be oriented by pushing on them with a stick. <p> An approach described in <ref> [ Narasimhan, 1994 ] </ref> synthesizes these ideas into an approach which uses a set of indexed local controllers to control the motion along a 40 Chapter 2: Manipulation Programming nominal plan. He terms this idea Local Control about a Nominal Plan (LCNP). <p> We assume that a local controller can be written for each dynamic partition which will locally keep the robot on a desired path. This approach was shown to work for pushing by <ref> [ Narasimhan, 1994 ] </ref> . Finally, it should be relatively easy to determine, at least pointwise, feature membership for points in phase-space. <p> Therefore, the observer will know that the next contacted feature can only be 3, 4, 5 but not 9. 5.3.4 Forward Projection Graphs and LCNP In LCNP (Local Control Nominal Path) <ref> [ Narasimhan, 1994 ] </ref> , the controller is assumed to keep the robot within an uncertainty ball about a nominal path using a stiffness type of control. The ball is at its maximum size in free space. Contact with a C-space surface projects the uncertainty ball onto the surface.

Reference-contexts: More general structures are also possible. This idea of event driven manipulation has been evolving under different names at many research centers. Nevins et al <ref> [ Nevins et al., 1973 ] </ref> presents one of the earliest event driven frameworks for programming a robot for assembly.

Reference-contexts: In Cartesian configuration spaces, force cones do provide a notion of distinguished sets. However, in problems with rotations the distinguished sets can be very large collections of the atoms. <ref> [ Robles, 1995 ] </ref> discusses this point; this thesis will revisit this problem in chapter 5 when features are formally defined. A second difficulty is that atoms can be too large. Each atom represents some region of configuration space. <p> Modification can be seen as a form of the expectation modification algorithm (EM). After the initial seed path is generated, assuming no uncertainty, the algorithm iteratively simulates possible outcomes and modifies the path in order to determine a more robust strategy. A similar idea is presented in <ref> [ Robles, 1995 ] </ref> , although here the focus is assembly. In this thesis, an action map for states that might be visited given the nominal path is determined using backchain planning without uncertainty. <p> The goal of any manipulation observer is to estimate the pose and relative motion of salient objects in a timely fashion. Observers can be built using a complete C-space representation <ref> [ Robles, 1995 ] </ref> , or local threshold tests on the signals can be designed to trigger events and, in effect, observe the relevant information. A C-space approach is powerful. It represents all of the relevant information and provides a convenient geometric framework for information fusion. <p> Many pairs of configurations for the two objects would produce a collision. This is explicitly represented in configuration space. Furthermore, this information could be incorporated if the non-parametric distribution was defined in configuration space. This is the approach in <ref> [ Robles, 1995 ] </ref> . However for n three dimensional objects the configuration space representation has complexity exponential in 6n.

For example, an initial grasp might be a power grasp in order to get a lot of contact information about an object.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 7 covers some aspects of this work. Although constraint is an important part of the assembly process, and is critical to force control, there appears to be little work in active sensing or processing of the information for the purposes of identifying the constraints on a part. <ref> [ Simunovic, 1979 ] </ref> presents one of the first results in this area.

Finally, the hardware used in this thesis is presented. 3.1 Human Manipulation Cues In general, touch tasks can be broadly divided into exploration tasks and manipulation tasks <ref> [ Srinivasan, 1991 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Some research has looked at the information that can be acquired by actively moving the contact sensor and monitoring both the sensor and joint locations. This is termed haptic sensing. Prior haptic research has primarily focused on actively tracing the contours of objects to determine geometry and critical features <ref> [ Brock and Chiu, 1985, Stansfield, 1987 ] </ref> . This work assumes that each measurement is taken with the force sensor in a quasi-static state so that normal forces and contact locations can be computed.
