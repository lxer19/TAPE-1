Abstract: Motion recovery from image correspondences is typically a problem of optimizing an objective function associated with the epipolar (or Longuet-Higgins) constraint. This objective function is defined on the so called essential manifold, which has a nice intrinsic Riemannian structure. Based on existing optimization techniques on Riemannian manifolds, in particular on Stiefel or Grassmann manifolds, we propose a Riemannian Newton algorithm to solve the motion recovery problem, making use of the natural geometric structure of the essential manifold. The same ideas also apply to conjugate gradient algorithms. The proposed geometric algorithms have quadratic rates of convergence.

This paper relies on familiarity with Edelman et al's work <ref> [3] </ref> and some background of modern Riemannian geometry (a good reference for Riemannian geometry is Spivak [17] or Kobayashi [8]). 3 Suppose (M 1 ; g 1 ) and (M 2 ; g 2 ) are two Riemannian manifolds with Riemannian metrics: g 1 (; ) : T M 1 fi <p> From the construction of r, it is also canonical.

We only applied Newton's method to the motion recovery problem since Newton's method has the fastest convergence rate (among algorithms using second order information, see <ref> [3] </ref> for a comparison). In fact, the application of other conjugate gradient algorithms would be easier since they usually only involve the calculation of the first order information (the gradient, not Hessian), at the cost of slower convergence rate.

Their nonlinear algorithms should also be consistent with each other. <p> Since the underlying manifold is nicer now, the expressions for the gradient and the Hessian will be much simpler. Similarly, the Hessian of the function f (!; v) is nondegenerate as long as the (differential version) eight-point linear algorithm has a unique solution <ref> [11] </ref>. 8 Discussions and Conclusions In this paper, we have studied in detail the problem of recovering a discrete motion (displacement) from image correspondences. <p> Similar ideas certainly apply to the differential case we briefly discussed in Section 6, where the rotation and translation are replaced by angular and linear velocities respectively <ref> [11] </ref>. The optimization schemes for the differential case have also been studied by many researchers, including the most recent Bilinear Projection Algorithm (BPA) proposed by Soatto [15]. However, we hope the Riemannian viewpoint will provide people a different point of view to revisit these schemes.

Horn's algorithm and the algorithm proposed by <ref> [18] </ref> are some of the few which consider explicitly the differential geometric properties of SO (3). However they do not make a connection and full exploitation of the differential geometric properties of the entire space of essential matrices as characterized in our recent papers [10, 11]. <p> Even from the efforts which rightly concentrated on the noise related aspects of the problem (i.e. trying different nonlinear objective functions etc.) none of the existing algorithms truly took advantage of the underlying geometrical structure of the problem. The underlying search space was usually parameterized for computational convenience <ref> [5, 18, 12] </ref> instead of being consistent to its intrinsic geometric structure. Consequently, in these algorithms, solving for optimal updating 2 direction typically involved using Lagrangian multipliers to deal with the constraints on the search space; and "walking" on such space was done approximately by the update-then-project procedure. <p> In this sense, the algorithms we are about to develop for the motion recovery are different from other existing algorithms which make use of particular parameterizations of the underlying search manifold T 1 (SO (3)), such as quaternions <ref> [5, 18, 7, 12] </ref>. 4 Optimization on the Essential Manifold Let F (R; S) be a function on T 1 (SO (3)) ~ = SO (3) fi S 2 with R 2 SO (3) represented by a 3 fi 3 rotation matrix and S 2 S 2 a unit vector in

Reference-contexts: The seminal work of Longuett-Higgins [9] on characterization of so called epipolar constraint, enabled decoupling of the structure and motion problems and led to the development of numerous linear and nonlinear algorithms for motion estimation (see <ref> [12, 4, 7, 23] </ref> for overviews). The epipolar constraint has been formulated both in discrete and differential setting and the recent work of the fl Computer vision research report.
