Abstract: In inventory control and production planning one is tempted to use one of two strategies: produce all demand to stock or produce all demand to order. The disadvantages are well-known. In the `make everything to order' case (MTO) the response times may become quite long if the load is high, in the `make everything to stock' case (MTS) one gets an enormous inventory if the number of different products is large. In this paper we study two simple models which combine MTO and MTS, and investigate the effect of combining MTO and MTS on the production lead times.

Reference-contexts: 5600 MB - Eindhoven, The Netherlands. 1 is addressed, such as: `Which items should be stocked or made to order?' and `How must production capacity allocated among MTO and MTS items?' In section 2 we first consider some simple queueing models for inventory systems related to the produce-to-stock systems in <ref> [1] </ref>, and investigate the relation between inventory and the production lead time. In particular tails of the production lead time distribution tend to be rather thick. Section 3 deals with the two type system, standard products to stock, specific products to order.

Reference-contexts: From this distribution it is straightforward to compute the distribution and moments of the production lead time. Numerical results show that combining MTO and MTS effectively reduces production lead times. The literature on these hybrid systems is growing fast. The papers <ref> [7, 2, 6, 3] </ref> study models where several items are produced by a common facility with limited capacity. Some of these items are produced to stock, others are produced to order. The MTO items have priority over MTS items.

Reference-contexts: We explicitly solved the equilibrium equations of the models in sections 3 and 4 by combining products of powers. Another approach which is well suited to solve these equations is the matrix-geometric approach developed by Neuts <ref> [5] </ref>. In fact, for the models considered in this paper the corresponding rate matrices R can be solved exactly by a simple recursion.
