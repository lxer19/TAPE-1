Reference-contexts: The algorithms of [GLS84] employ the ellipsoid method, and are not considered to be efficient in practice. In his Ph.D. work <ref> [Ali91] </ref>, Farid Alizadeh showed that many of the known interior point methods for LP readily extend to polynomial time algorithms for solving SDP approximately (see x1.5).

Reference-contexts: Historically, semidefinite programming has been studied in more general contexts such as convex and cone programming (see <ref> [Ali95] </ref> for references). However, the more recent surge of interest in SDP was primarily inspired by the work of [GLS84] (see [GLS88], Chapter 9). <p> We also mention [Jar91] as an early work on extending LP interior point methods to SDP. A certain generalization of the standard LP duality has been considered in <ref> [Ali95] </ref> and [NN94]. This can also be seen as a specialization of the Lagrangean dual of (P) when this problem is viewed as a cone program. <p> Moreover, these computations are not polynomial time. Let us take a closer look at these two approaches. - 3 - 1.3.1 The Lagrange-Slater Dual for SDP Here is the dual as stated <ref> [Ali95] </ref> and [NN94] (note that we are using Primal and Dual in reversed sense here as compared to [Ali95]) 2 . <p> Let us take a closer look at these two approaches. - 3 - 1.3.1 The Lagrange-Slater Dual for SDP Here is the dual as stated <ref> [Ali95] </ref> and [NN94] (note that we are using Primal and Dual in reversed sense here as compared to [Ali95]) 2 . <p> We consider a Semidefinite Program to be the optimization problem: sup : c T x P m (P) Note that any semidefinite program as considered in <ref> [Ali95] </ref> can be cast in the above form. <p> Proof: Most of these results are quite classical, and may be found in texts on Matrix Analysis [HJ85]. We make critical use of (6) and (7). The proof of (6) may be found in <ref> [Ali95] </ref>, and that of (7) is given here. Suppose that U W W T - 0. Then, for an arbitrary x 2 &lt; n , if U x = 0, then x T U x = 0, and x T (U W W T )x 0.

Reference-contexts: We will now examine two previously known duality theories for SDP. * The dual proposed in ([Ali95],[NN94]) satisfies 1 above, but needs to assume certain Slater-like con straint qualifications for 2 and 3 to hold. * On the other hand, the duality approach presented in <ref> [BW81] </ref> (when specialized to SDP) while theoretically satisfying 2, has the following shortcoming: this dual is not an explicit semidefinite program as it requires certain computations to be performed in order to extract the dual. Moreover, these computations are not polynomial time. <p> Therefore, the necessity for a more satisfactory duality theory for SDP is quite evident. 1.3.2 The Minimal Cone Based Approach This approach was proposed by Borwein and Wolkowicz <ref> [BW81] </ref>. In simplified terms, they consider a cone programming problem supfc T xjb Ax 2 Sg; where S is a convex cone, which in the case of SDP will be the cone of PSD matrices.

Reference-contexts: In a recent work <ref> [Fre95] </ref>, Bob Freund discusses interior-point algorithms for SDPs in which no regularity (Slater-like) conditions are assumed. Progression from "weak optimization" to "strong optimization" is made difficult as there exist SDPs with certain undesirable features as described in the following. 1.6 "Ill-Conditioned" SDPs 1.

Reference-contexts: The existing algorithms for SDP can be characterized as those that find approximate optimal solutions to SDP, and for this very reason are incapable of solving the decision problems 1 to 3 of SDPP in polynomial time. As will be shown (x9), there are polynomial reductions <ref> [GJ79] </ref> to SDFP from boundedness and attainment (parts 2. and 3. of SDPP), as well as other decision problems concerning SDP. Thus, SDFP assumes a central role in a rigorous complexity theoretic treatment of semidefinite programming. <p> Systems of Alternative essentially give "certificates" of infeasibility. Prior to the publication of the Ellipsoid Algorithm in 1979, which showed that Linear Programming was polynomial time solvable, the LP Farkas Lemma enabled one to conclude that the feasibility problem for linear inequalities is in NP"Co-NP (see Chapter 7 of <ref> [GJ79] </ref>). The significance of the membership of a problem in NP"Co-NP derives from the widely held belief that P=NP"Co-NP ([GJ79]). <p> We will derive a polynomial size explicit semidefinite system of alternative (aka Farkas Lemma) for (1), and employ it to derive the following complexity results: 1. If SDFP2NP, then SDFP2Co-NP, and vice versa. 2. SDFP is not NP-Complete unless NP=Co-NP, in the Turing Machine model <ref> [GJ79] </ref>. 3. SDFP is in NP"Co-NP in the real number model of Blum, Shub and Smale [BSS89]. - 5 - 4. <p> The two computational models of our interest are * The Turing Machine model <ref> [GJ79] </ref> (abbreviated as TM Model here). We will mainly borrow notation in Chapters 2 and 7 of Garey and Johnson [GJ79]. * The real number model of Blum, shub and Smale [BSS89] (abbreviated as BSS Model). <p> The two computational models of our interest are * The Turing Machine model <ref> [GJ79] </ref> (abbreviated as TM Model here). We will mainly borrow notation in Chapters 2 and 7 of Garey and Johnson [GJ79]. * The real number model of Blum, shub and Smale [BSS89] (abbreviated as BSS Model). <p> In the BSS model, it follows from some previous results that SDFP is in NP, and it is shown here that it is also in Co-NP. A language <ref> [GJ79] </ref> (or a decision problem) is defined to be Semidefinite Reducible, if there exists a polynomial reduction from that language to SDFP. Our main result of the section is the following. Theorem 6 The following hold concerning SDFP: 1. If SDFP2NP, then SDFP2Co-NP and vice-versa. 2. <p> This directly implies 1. To prove 2, suppose that SDFP is NP-Complete (in the TM model). Then, in particular, it is in NP, and then 1 implies that SDFP is in NP"Co-NP. By Theorem 7.2 of <ref> [GJ79] </ref>, the existence of an NP-Complete problem in NP"Co-NP implies that NP=Co-NP. The proof of 3 will follow if we show that SDFP is in NP for the BSS model.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, there are simple instances of SDPs for which this Lagrangean dual exhibits a duality gap. As already mentioned, we remedy this situation in this paper, by deriving an explicit dual for SDP which has no duality gap. A recent result of Goemans and Williamson <ref> [GW94] </ref> showing that one can use the solution obtained from a semidefinite relaxation to obtain a :878-approximation algorithm for the Max-Cut problem, gave further impetus to Semidefinite Programming. Their result employs an ingenious randomized rounding scheme.

However, the more recent surge of interest in SDP was primarily inspired by the work of <ref> [GLS84] </ref> (see [GLS88], Chapter 9). In that work, the authors associate with every graph G, a convex set denoted by TH (G), and show that when G is perfect, this set equals the stable set polytope. <p> Then they demonstrate that one can optimize over TH (G) in polynomial time, and hence the stable set problem (along with many other related problems) can be solved in polynomial time for perfect graphs. The algorithms of <ref> [GLS84] </ref> employ the ellipsoid method, and are not considered to be efficient in practice. In his Ph.D. work [Ali91], Farid Alizadeh showed that many of the known interior point methods for LP readily extend to polynomial time algorithms for solving SDP approximately (see x1.5).

Reference-contexts: We can - 23 - perform this task in O (maxfn 3 ; mn 2 g) arithmetic computations as follows: first compute the combination matrix Q (x) in O (mn 2 ) steps and then apply partial Cholesky decomposition (see [GLS88] or <ref> [Ram93] </ref>) to check if this matrix is positive semidefinite in O (n 3 ) steps. 2 The reason one cannot extend the above proof that SDFP2 NP"Co-NP for the BSS model to the TM model is because feasible semidefinite inequalities need not always have rational solutions of polynomial size (see examples <p> But there may exist a representation theory for solutions of semidefinite systems, which offer polynomial time representable and verifiable certificates (see the remarks at the end of x1.6). Since the general case of SDFP appears to be quite difficult, it is natural to consider certain special cases. In <ref> [Ram93] </ref>, it was shown that if m is fixed, then, whenever Q (x) 0 is feasible, then there exists a rational solution of polynomial bitlength satisfying this inequality.

Reference-contexts: Proof: From Theorem 6.3 of [Roc70], ri (K) = ri (Cl (K)) = &lt; m ; and hence K = &lt; m 2. 2.4 A Brief Sketch of the Approach The technique used here emerged from the results of <ref> [RG94a] </ref>, where certain geometric properties of spec-trahedra (G) were investigated. In particular, in order to understand the polars (G ffi ) of spectrahedra, an object called the algebraic polar (G fl ) was introduced (see x5). This is an "algebraic approximation" of polar, which is a geometric object. <p> But then, H = H ffiffi G ffi ; and the proof is complete. 2.

Lemma 5 Let G = fxjQ (x) - 0g with Q 0 - 0. <p> The proof of Claim 1 is complete. 2 The proof of the following Claim 2 was inspired and closely parallels that of Lemma 5 given in <ref> [RG94a] </ref>. - 17 - Claim 2 Let T = fxjAx = 0g, where A is an r fi m full row rank matrix, and let G = fxjQ (x) - 0g be any spectrahedron containing the origin.

Reference-contexts: Finally, there is some reason to hope that Graph/Matrix Isomorphism is Semidefinite Reducible (x9), i.e. one can reduce it to SDFP.
