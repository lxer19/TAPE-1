Title: An Approach to Modeling Indexicality in Action and Communication

Abstract: While many uses of context sensitive expressions in language are just communicative shortcuts, ways of succinctly referring to the relevant entities, there are also cases where the information that needs to be communicated is intrinsically indexical. To model this, one needs a formal account of communication that relates the context sensitivity of language to that of mental states and action. In this paper, we develop a preliminary version of such an account, using our theory of indexical knowledge and action as a foundation. The account includes a formalization of the notion of mutual indexical knowledge, a specification of the semantics of a communication language that includes indexicals, and a formalization of the pragmatics of declarative utterances that supports reasoning about the ability of agents to achieve goals by making such utterances.

Reference-contexts: But a more serious problem is that the way utterance events are individuated is inappropriate if one is to account for what agents need to know to be able to achieve their goals by making speech acts (as in Appelt's work <ref> [1] </ref>). In the approach sketched above, utterance events determine not only the sentence used, but also who the speaker and addressee are, where the utterance is made, perhaps what gestures are made, etc. But speakers cannot be guaranteed to know all the contextual facts involved in an utterance. <p> One would also want an account of why some non-de re readings and not others are suggested by such utterances depending on the context. Communicative Acts and Ability In this section, we develop a simple account of the pragmatics of declaratives in the style of Appelt <ref> [1] </ref>. The account uses the communication language semantics of the previous section, and thus can deal with indexical ity in the communication language as well as in thought and action. The account also allows one to model (and reason about) the ability of agents to achieve goals by making utterances.

Reference-contexts: It would also be better to talk about intention rather than Goal; we could borrow Cohen and Levesque's formalization of intention <ref> [2] </ref> to provide for that. We will try to alleviate these deficiencies in future versions of the account.

Reference-contexts: To this we add the operator Goal drawn from Cohen and Levesque's formalism <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Goal (') means that ' follows from the agent's goals at the current time. As for Know, we interpret Goal as a relation over indices, thus handling indexical goals (e.g., an agent's goal that he himself be holding a cup five minutes from now). <p> This would involve introduc ing terms that denote possible worlds and contexts into the logic and defining a truth predicate over sentences of the communication language taking such terms as arguments. Cohen and Levesque's semantic specification in <ref> [3] </ref> is set up to handle indexicals partly along these lines: their semantic predicates TRUE, REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS, take the utterance event as argu ment. So, for example, their semantics might yield j=(TRUE `I am hungry' e) (SPEAKER e x) ^ (HUNGRY x) where e is the utterance event.

If this language includes indexicals or other context sensitive elements, the semantic specification must deal with them.

Reference-contexts: CanDo (if ('; ffi 1 ; ffi 2 )) def = (Know (') ^ CanDo (ffi 1 )) _ (Know (:' c ) ^ CanDo (ffi 2 )) Note that we eliminate Moore's requirement that the agent know who he is; instead, we require indexical knowledge (see <ref> [13] </ref> for a discussion of why this is better). Also, the fact that our account of ability is based on a more expressive temporal logic allows it to deal with actions whose prerequisites or effects involve knowledge of absolute times and knowing what time it is.

Reference-contexts: True (False) stands for some tautology (contradiction). Our formalization of ability, based on that of Moore's <ref> [14] </ref>, says that the agent is able to achieve the goal ' by doing action ffi, formally Can (ffi; '), if and only if he can do action ffi and knows that after doing ffi, the goal ' must hold: Can (ffi; ') def = CanDo (ffi) ^ Know (AfterNec (ffi;
