Abstract: A new algorithm for the generation of anisotropic, unstructured triangular meshes in two dimensions is described. Inputs to the algorithm are the boundary geometry and a metric that specifies the desired element size and shape as a function of position. The algorithm is an example of what we call pliant mesh generation. It first constructs the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain, then iteratively smooths, refines, and retriangulates. On each iteration, a node is selected at random, it is repositioned according to attraction/repulsion with its neighbors, the neighborhood is retriangulated, and nodes are inserted or deleted as necessary. All operations are done relative to the metric tensor. This simple method generates high quality meshes whose elements conform well to the requested shape metric. The method appears particularly well suited to surface meshing and viscous flow simulations, where stretched triangles are desirable, and to time-dependent remeshing problems.

Reference-contexts: The Lennard-Jones potential from chemistry describes attraction/repulsion behavior [1]. Its smoothing function is f .d/ D d 13 d 7 . For mesh generation purposes, this model suffers from numerical instabilities, since f .0 C / ! 1, so several variants have been proposed <ref> [19, 3] </ref>. a) Laplacian b) Lennard-Jones c) Shimada d) Ours After testing several alternatives, we have chosen f .d/D .1d 4 / exp.d 4 /, pictured in Figure 6d. We have found that smoothing functions with such attraction/repulsion behavior yield better results [3]. <p> We have found that smoothing functions with such attraction/repulsion behavior yield better results <ref> [3] </ref>. If two nodes are too close to each other (d &lt; 1), they repel, and if too distant (d &gt; 1), they attract. This is different from Laplacian smoothing where nodes always attract each other, regardless of distance. <p> This is different from Laplacian smoothing where nodes always attract each other, regardless of distance. Our neighborhood N i is also defined as the set of nodes which share an edge with i, and ff i is set to 0:2. 2 Second order is also possible <ref> [3, 19] </ref> but is not considered here. 6 5th Intl. Meshing Roundtable, Oct. 1996 The new position for the vertex is only accepted if it does not violate the triangulation. <p> Retriangulation after insertion is done using incremental Delaunay triangulation [11, 9]. In our context, point location is unnecessary because we know the edge being split. After deletion, we construct an initial triangulation of the resulting simple polygon and apply edge swapping to the edges internal to the polygon <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.3 Node Tagging and Convergence This combination of smoothing, retriangulation, and insertion/deletion tends to drive all the edges to a normalized length of 1. To monitor convergence, nodes are marked as active or inactive. Initially all nodes are active. Only active nodes can be picked for smoothing. <p> For a graded, isotropic mesh with element size r.x/, M would be a diagonal matrix with m 11 D m 22 D 1=r 2 .x/. 3 These constants are derived in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5th Intl.

Reference-contexts: answer is that as the number of triangles goes to infinity, the optimal triangles' orientation is given by the eigenvectors of the Hessian of the function at each point, and their size in each direction is given by the reciprocal square root of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvalue <ref> [5, 21] </ref>. Thus, large angles can be optimal for minimizing approximation error [17]. Viscous flow simulations demanding extreme aspect ratios have traditionally been done using structured meshes exclusively, or with a combination of structured meshes along boundaries and unstructured meshes in the remainder of the domain.

Welch used a combination of Laplacian smoothing and surface Delaunay triangulation to maintain a quality mesh on a dynamic surface [24]. <p> The Lennard-Jones potential from chemistry describes attraction/repulsion behavior [1]. Its smoothing function is f .d/ D d 13 d 7 . For mesh generation purposes, this model suffers from numerical instabilities, since f .0 C / ! 1, so several variants have been proposed <ref> [19, 3] </ref>. a) Laplacian b) Lennard-Jones c) Shimada d) Ours After testing several alternatives, we have chosen f .d/D .1d 4 / exp.d 4 /, pictured in Figure 6d. We have found that smoothing functions with such attraction/repulsion behavior yield better results [3]. <p> This is different from Laplacian smoothing where nodes always attract each other, regardless of distance. Our neighborhood N i is also defined as the set of nodes which share an edge with i, and ff i is set to 0:2. 2 Second order is also possible <ref> [3, 19] </ref> but is not considered here. 6 5th Intl.

Meshing Roundtable, Oct. 1996 11 Although we have not done side-by-side empirical tests, we make some preliminary comparisons with previous mesh generators. Relative to the methods of Shimada-Gossard and Ruppert <ref> [20, 18] </ref>, our method is more general by virtue of supporting anisotropy, and it appears to be faster than the former.

Reference-contexts: The desired size and shape of elements is application-dependent <ref> [21, 14] </ref>. For finite element approximation of many elliptic partial differential equations, equilateral triangles are ideal, but to simulate anisotropic diffusion or viscous fluid flow, elongated elements with extreme aspect ratio are often desirable. <p> answer is that as the number of triangles goes to infinity, the optimal triangles' orientation is given by the eigenvectors of the Hessian of the function at each point, and their size in each direction is given by the reciprocal square root of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvalue <ref> [5, 21] </ref>. Thus, large angles can be optimal for minimizing approximation error [17]. Viscous flow simulations demanding extreme aspect ratios have traditionally been done using structured meshes exclusively, or with a combination of structured meshes along boundaries and unstructured meshes in the remainder of the domain.

Reference-contexts: For anisotropic mesh generation, the element size function is generalized to describe shape as well as size, with a 2 fi 2 matrix M.x/. In differential geometry, this is called a Riemannian metric tensor <ref> [22] </ref>. The element size function can be visualized as a field of ellipses whose major radius, minor radius, and angle are functions of position (see Figure 10b). The metric is isotropic iff M has equal eigenvalues, in which case the ellipses are circles. <p> This is equivalent to measuring distance in a normalized space where the ellipse is mapped to a unit circle using the rotation and scaling transformation 33 1=2 R T . A more rigorous definition of distance would require integration <ref> [22, p. 30] </ref>; by assuming the metric to be locally constant, we achieve the less expensive formula above [4, 3]. In a mesh conforming to this metric, the neighbors of node i lie close to the ellipse d.p i ; y/ D 1. <p> A more complex mesh representing an idealized hyperbolic shock front is shown in figures 13 and 14. The aspect ratio of the triangles grows towards the center of the mesh, where it reaches 100:1. The histograms demonstrate that the normalized angles <ref> [22, eq. (8.19)] </ref> are close to 60 degrees and the elements are close to the desired size. Figure 14 shows that even in the region of maximum aspect ratio, the mesh is very regular and the elements are well shaped. Indigo2 with 250 MHz MIPS R4400 processor.

Reference-contexts: When smoothing is used on anisotropic meshes, it, too, should conform to the metric tensor [10]. Vallet et al. use a combination of insertion, deletion, retriangulation, and anisotropic smoothing <ref> [23, 7] </ref>. Anisotropic meshes can also be generated without reference to metrics or stretched space. Marcum generates meshes that are semi-structured and anisotropic near boundaries, but unstructured and isotropic in the interior [12]. In spite of the progress described above, problems remain. <p> Our technique is probably most similar to those of Castro-Daz et al. [4] and Vallet et al. <ref> [23, 7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The metric is isotropic iff M has equal eigenvalues, in which case the ellipses are circles. In the context of adaptive finite element methods, the metric tensor can be derived from the Hessian of a previous solution <ref> [16, 26] </ref>. For anisotropic mesh generation, distances are often defined using a local metric tensor. The advancing front method can remesh a domain anisotropically by positioning new nodes according to the metric [16].
