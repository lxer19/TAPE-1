Abstract: In order to learn effectively, a system must not only possess knowledge about the world and be able to improve that knowledge, but it also must introspectively reason about how it performs a given task and what particular pieces of knowledge it needs to improve its performance at the current task. Introspection requires a declaratflive representation of the reasoning performed by the system during the performance task. This paper presents a taxonomy of possible reasoning failures that can occur during this task, their declarative representations, and their associations with particular learning strategies. We propose a theory of Meta-XPs, which are explanation structures that help the system identify failure types and choose appropriate learning strategies in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future. A program called Meta-AQUA embodies the theory and processes examples in the domain of drug smuggling.

Reference-contexts: The paper closes with discussion and future direction for research. 219 2 Motivational Example: The Drug Bust This research implements an introspective version of AQUA <ref> (Ram, 1989, 1991) </ref>, called Meta-AQUA. AQUA is a question-driven story understanding system that learns about Middle Eastern terrorist activities. Its performance task is to "understand" the story by building causal explanations that link the individual events into a coherent whole. <p> To represent these conditions Meta-AQUA uses standard non-monotonic logic values of in (in the current set of beliefs) and out (out of the current set of beliefs) (Doyle, 1979). Added to these are the values hypothesized-in (weakly assumed in), hypothesized-out (weakly assumed out), and hypothesized (unknown) <ref> (Ram, 1989) </ref>. Thus absolute retrieval failure is represented by A [truth = in] = E [truth = out]. Cuts across links in the figure signify causal relations for which the truth slot of the frame is out.

Reference-contexts: Further, it allows the system to pose knowledge goals about aspects of the reasoning process itself. 4 A model of reasoning about knowledge goals The AQUA system embodies a theory of motivational explanation based on decision models <ref> (Ram, 1990a) </ref> which model the decision process that an agent goes through in deciding whether to perform an action. For example, the religious fanatic explanation for suicide bombing is a decision model describing why a bomber should choose to perform a terrorist strike in which the bomber dies.

Reference-contexts: The error is found by searching all hypothesis generation D-C-NODES on the path from the EXPLAINS node of A to E performing elaborative question asking <ref> (Ram, 1990b) </ref>. This case has not yet been represented declaratively. Meta-AQUA reasons about it using a general search heuristic for blame assignment. A Falsifies domain co-domain Constraint isa isa Parent is used to direct learning in the example from section 2.
