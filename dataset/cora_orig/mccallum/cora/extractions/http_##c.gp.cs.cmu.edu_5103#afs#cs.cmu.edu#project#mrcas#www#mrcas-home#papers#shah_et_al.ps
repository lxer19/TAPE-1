Abstract: In this paper we discuss the application of the fictitious domain method to the numerical simulation of the mechanical processes induced by press-fitting cementless femoral implants in total hip replacement surgeries. The immediate concern is to demonstrate the feasibility of the method, its advantages over other competing numerical techniques and its applicability to a wide range of analysis problems in bio-mechanics whose primary input originates from CT- or MRI-collected data. We consider the implantation of a press-fit femoral prosthesis as a prototype problem for sketching the application path of the proposed methodology. Of concern is also the assessment of the robustness and speed of the methodology, for both factors are critical if one were to consider patient-specific modeling. The latter is part of a thrust to develop pre-operative planners enhanced with robust and fast biomechanical feedback. In this communication we present the concepts and report on initial numerical results.

Reference-contexts: introduction might prevent selections leading to either short or long-term failures of the chosen prosthesis and thus to a possible improvement of the clinical outcome. The recent introduction of robotic systems in the operating room <ref> [1] </ref> -responsible for preparing the bone canal receiving the implant only augmented the need for pre-operative planners enhanced with such a biomechanical feedback. However, the inclusion of a feedback module into a pre-operative system imposes a severe demand for computational speed and robustness of the underlying geometry and analysis tools.

We later extended our studies to the all important elasticity case.
