Abstract: Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation cen-tred around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.

Reference-contexts: The fact that the agent learns may have some effect on the distribution of future episodes, and little is known about learning in such cases <ref> (Aldous & Vazirani, 1990) </ref>. We could also relax the deterministic and episodic requirement to allow non-immediate rewards, thereby making connections to current research on reinforcement learning.

Reference-contexts: Some consideration has been given more recently to the tractability of general moral policies, with a view to making them understandable and usable by persons of average intelligence <ref> (Brandt, 1953) </ref>. Cherniak (1986) has suggested a definition of "minimal rationality", specifying lower bounds on the reasoning powers of any rational agent, instead of upper bounds. A philosophical proposal generally consistent with the notion of bounded optimality can be found in Dennett's "Moral First Aid Manual" (1986).

Reference-contexts: Much of this work is concerned with metalevel rationality. Metareasoning | reasoning about reasoning | is an important technique in this area, since it enables an agent to control its deliberations according to their costs and benefits. Combined with the idea of anytime <ref> (Dean & Boddy, 1988) </ref> or flexible algorithms (Horvitz, 1987), that return better results as time goes by, a simple form of metareasoning allows an agent to behave well in a real-time environment. A simple example is provided by iterative-deepening algorithms used in game-playing. <p> We assume that the deadline must come eventually, so that P also define the cumulative deadline distribution P d . If the deadline does not occur at a known time, then we need to distinguish between two cases: * The agent receives a percept, called a herald <ref> (Dean & Boddy, 1988) </ref>, which announces an impending deadline.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers in AI, some of whose work is discussed below, have worked on the problem of designing agents with limited computational resources. The 1989 AAAI Symposium on AI and Limited Rationality <ref> (Fehling & Russell, 1989) </ref> contains an interesting variety of work on the topic. Much of this work is concerned with metalevel rationality. Metareasoning | reasoning about reasoning | is an important technique in this area, since it enables an agent to control its deliberations according to their costs and benefits.

Reference-contexts: We begin by defining agents and environments in terms of the actions and percepts that they exchange, and the sequence of states they go through. The agent is described by an agent function from percept sequences to actions. This treatment is fairly standard <ref> (see, e.g., Genesereth & Nilsson, 1987) </ref>. We then go "inside" the agent to look at the agent program that generates its actions, and define the "implementation" relationship between a program and the corresponding agent function.

Reference-contexts: In the theory of games, bounds on the complexity of players have become a topic of intense interest. For example, it is a troubling fact that defection is the only equilibrium strategy for unbounded agents playing a fixed number of rounds of the Prisoners' Dilemma game. Neyman's theorem <ref> (Neyman, 1985) </ref>, recently proved by Papadimitriou and Yan-nakakis (1994), shows that an essentially cooperative equilibrium exists if each agent is a finite automaton with a number of states that is less than exponential in the number of rounds.

Reference-contexts: A UABO program is therefore a universal real-time solution for a given task. Do UABO programs exist? If so, how can we construct them? It turns out that we can use the scheduling construction from <ref> (Russell & Zilberstein, 1991) </ref> to design UABO programs. This construction was designed to reduce task environments with unknown interrupt times to the case of known deadlines, and the same insight applies here.
