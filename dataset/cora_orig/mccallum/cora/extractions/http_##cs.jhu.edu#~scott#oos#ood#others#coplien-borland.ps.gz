Title: Borland Software Craftsmanship: A New Look at Process, Quality and Productivity  
Author: James O. Coplien 
Keyword: David Intersimone, Director of Developer Relations, Borland  
Affiliation: Software Production Research Department AT&T Bell Laboratories  
Date: 5 June 1994  
Note: Proceedings of the 5th Annual Borland International Conference, Orlando, Florida,  1: Introduction Last year, Borland invited me to speak at the Fourth Annual Borland International conference in San Diego, California, and to visit their location in Scotts Valley, California. I made arrangements with David Intersimone, 1  
Abstract: The Borland Quattro Pro for Windows (QPW) development is one of the most remarkable organizations, processes, and development cultures we have encountered in the AT&T Bell Laboratories Pasteur process research project. The project assimilated requirements, completed design and implementation of 1 million lines of code, and completed testing in 31 months. Coding was done by no more than eight people at a time, which means that individual coding productivity was higher than 1000 lines of code per staff-week. The project capitalized on its small size by centering development activities around daily meetings where architecture, design, and interface issues were socialized. Quality assurance and project management roles were central to the development sociology, in contrast to the developer-centric software production most often observed in our studies of AT&T telecommunications software. Analyses of the development process are ``off the charts'' relative to most other processes we have studied. Jim Thanks again for speaking at BIC '93. I'm also glad you could stop by Borland and experience what we call Borland Software Craftsmanship. We are a young company, started by a Frenchman, with young bright and excited developers. In my 8 years at Borland I have been in the center of it all and can't imagine another place to be. Let us know if there is anything else we can do for you. Director of Borland Developer Relations, to speak at the conference in exchange for access to one of their development organizations. Interviews with such development organizations have helped the process community better understand the high-level characteristics of software development organizations. We can use this understanding to help projects assess their development methods against those used in other development cultures. I was enthusiastically received and graciously hosted, a harbinger of other positive signs of the Borland culture that I would observe that day. I was treated to insights into one the most stunning development efforts I have had the pleasure to study. In this paper, I relate what I learned while meeting with the development team for Borland's Quattro Pro for Windows 1.0 (QPW) on May 20, 1993, in Scotts Valley. I feel there is much to be learned about their process, technology, and organization that we can apply to projects across the industry, including large projects and perhaps even embedded and real-time system developments such as we have in AT&T. It is important to understand that this is a retrospective on the development of the software for the initial offering of QPW. There was little or no embedded base, and the project didn't face the constraints one finds in the legacy code projects common in large, traditional telecommunication projects. Even so, the phenomenal productivity of this group and the factors contributing to that productivity are thought-provoking. Most organizations should be able to take a page from Borland's book as a basis for their own process improvements. This paper starts with a high-level description of the project and describes the personalities in the development effort. The next section gives a brief review of the data acquisition technique used. Analyses of the data from our process analysis technique follow in the next section. Subsequent sections of the paper describe aspects of the QPW development that stood out as contributing to its success.

Reference-contexts: It's not clear whether this owes to our history, our organizational boundaries, the nature of our business, or to reward mechanisms. Nevertheless, a deeply rooted cultural behavior at AT&T is that engineers draft their own memos. Developers spend much time (roughly 13% of total development time <ref> [7] </ref>) creating and refining memos in AT&T; in Borland, that job is deferred to people who are expert at it. 7: Architecture and Meetings; Coding and Iteration QPW development was highly iterative. To understand the nature of the iteration, one must understand its ramifications for architecture and implementation.

Borland clearly appears to be in this latter categorythough it may not register a Level 3 rating according to commonly accepted criteria.
