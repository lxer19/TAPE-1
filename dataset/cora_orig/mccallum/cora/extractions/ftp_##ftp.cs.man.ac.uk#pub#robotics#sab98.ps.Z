Title: Landmark-Based Navigation for a Mobile Robot

Abstract: In this paper we present a landmark based navigation mechanism for a mobile robot. The system uses a self-organising mechanism to map the environment as the robot is led around that environment by an operator. Detected landmarks, and their relative position towards each other, are recorded in a map that can subsequently be used to plan and execute paths from the robot's current location to a `goal' location specified by the user. The main motivation for the research described in this paper is to develop a mobile robot navigation system that is robust (through the use of perceptual landmarks), and allows the robot to plan arbitrary paths within its known environment. The system presented here achieves these objectives.

Reference-contexts: Other network methods that have been used in the context of landmark detection include the Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) classifier (Reilly et al., 1982), used, for example, by Kurz (Kurz, 1996), and the Adap- tive Resonance Theory (ART) classifier <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987) </ref>, used, for instance, by Duckett and Nehmzow (Duckett and Nehmzow, 1997). Neither of the latter methods require a settlement period to achieve a stable clustering of the input space (thus allowing immediate placement of vector links), and both are able to grow to accommodate new classifications.

Reference-contexts: By employing a vector mapping of this type we restrict the use of odometry to the measurement required between locations, thus limiting the accumulation of odometry error. In previous work, a Self-Organising Feature Map (SOFM) <ref> (Kohonen, 1988) </ref> has been used to map the robot's environment. Using this method, mapbuilding is achieved by performing an unsupervised clustering of the sensory data of the robot as it moves through the environment (Nehmzow and Smithers, 1991; Owen and Nehmzow, 1996).

Reference-contexts: Various approaches to the problem of perceptual aliasing have been utilized within the topological mapping paradigm. One method is to effectively increase the robot's perceptual resolution by adding and combining additional information from differing sensor modalities (sensor fusion). In <ref> (Kortencamp and Weymouth, 1994) </ref>, for example, vision is used to augment the sonar data of the robot. However, this type of approach cannot be guaranteed to disambiguate all situations, and is more useful as a tool for reducing, rather than eliminating, perceptual ambiguity.

Reference-contexts: How- ever, since positional information based on the robot's internal odometry is subject to drift effects, some means of correction is required if the robot is to map anything other than small scale environments. In <ref> (Kurz, 1996) </ref>, for example, an extended Kalman-filter is used for drift compensation. The system described in this paper constructs a topological map of the environment based on a process of self-organisation of the robot's sensory data. The approach of self-organisation to landmark detection was chosen for two reasons. <p> On the other hand, the larger the network the more expensive the algorithm becomes at lookup time. Other network methods that have been used in the context of landmark detection include the Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) classifier (Reilly et al., 1982), used, for example, by Kurz <ref> (Kurz, 1996) </ref>, and the Adap- tive Resonance Theory (ART) classifier (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987), used, for instance, by Duckett and Nehmzow (Duckett and Nehmzow, 1997).

Reference-contexts: Global positional information is not required. A metric was introduced (Distance Efficiency) and used to measure the robot's navigational behaviour. In order for a robot navigation system to be useful it must operate in real world situations <ref> (Owen and Nehmzow, 1997) </ref>. Much of the work to date in the field of mobile robot navigation has been conducted in small scale laboratory environments the question arises of how these systems will scale up when faced with more complex environments covering much larger distances.
