Abstract: Reading is an area of human cognition which has been studied for decades by psychologists, education researchers, and artificial intelligence researchers. Yet, there still does not exist a theory which accurately describes the complete process. We believe that these past attempts fell short due to an incomplete understanding of the overall task of reading; namely, the complete set of mental tasks a reasoner must perform to read and the mechanisms that carry out these tasks. We present a functional theory of the reading process and argue that it represents a coverage of the task. The theory combines experimental results from psychology, artificial intelligence, education, and linguistics, along with the insights we have gained from our own research. This greater understanding of the mental tasks necessary for reading will enable new natural language understanding systems to be more flexible and more capable than earlier ones. Furthermore, we argue that creativity is a necessary component of the reading process and must be considered in any theory or system attempting to describe it. We present a functional theory of creative reading and a novel knowledge organization scheme that supports the creativity mechanisms. The reading theory is currently being implemented in the ISAAC (Integrated Story Analysis And Creativity) system, a computer system which reads science fiction stories. fl This paper is part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing, Technical Report series.

Reference-contexts: Some were concerned with what it is, some with how to teach it, some with why people read, and others with how the act is accomplished. A junior high school literature textbook <ref> (Beck et al., 1991) </ref> concisely sums up the above views. At the start of the text, the authors attempt to explain to the reader both how and why people read. They point out that for many readers, the answer to that question [why people read] is, `To meet new people.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the system could simply make arbitrary relaxations. Both of these options have been argued against from a theoretical perspective <ref> (Birnbaum, 1986) </ref>. <p> These include ATNs, statistical analysis, and more sophisticated parsing methods. Some had a great deal of success; however, 30 A Functional Theory of Creative Reading there are many sentence problems which can be more easily solved through the use of higher level processes <ref> (Birnbaum, 1986) </ref>. The sentence processing supertask must be interwoven with the entire system. Without doing this, it is difficult to move much beyond sentence level comprehension. While they made significant contributions to the areas they focused on, these past systems all ignored aspects of the total reading process.

Reference-contexts: By tracking this movement, the reasoner can decide when creative understanding has become too expensive to allow to continue, based on the goals and tasks of the reasoner. 8 Implementation The ISAAC system is currently implemented at a level of functionality capable of reading the story Men Are Different <ref> (Bloch, 1963) </ref>. ISAAC is built in Common Lisp and uses the KR frame package (Giuse, 1990) for basic knowledge representation. ISAAC currently uses the COMPERE parsing system (Mahesh, 1993) as a drop-in module for its sentence processing supertask.

Reference-contexts: The other restriction, that of directedness, ensures that the agent in question did not simply randomly generate solutions until a creative one arose. While randomness is often seen as a necessary part of creativity <ref> (Boden, 1991) </ref>, it is not desirable for this randomness to be totally unconstrained. <p> If the act is creative to the individual but not to society in general, it is a self-creative act, also known as psychological-creative or P-creative <ref> (Boden, 1991) </ref>. An example 10 A Functional Theory of Creative Reading of this would a child discovering the number-theoretic relationship that the digits of a number divisible by nine must sum to a number divisible by nine. <p> The reverse of this is when the reasoner sees an act as mundane but others view it as creative. This may come about if the reasoner has some knowledge that the general public lacks. Finally, a historical-creative or H-creative <ref> (Boden, 1991) </ref> act results if the reasoner finds an act creative as does the rest of society. In both the internal and external perspectives on novelty, it is important that the reasoner whose point of view is being considered is aware that the artifact is indeed novel .

Reference-contexts: With the implementation increased to the above levels, we will be able to judge the validity of some of our theoretical claims. Various experimental tests will be performed on the system in order to gauge its abilities. Ablation studies <ref> (Cohen & Howe, 1988) </ref> will be done to pinpoint the impact each form of knowledge and each supertask has on the overall task of reading. These results will be compared to psychological data concerning the reading process.

Reference-contexts: This willing suspension of disbelief <ref> (first described by Samuel Taylor Coleridge as reported in Corrigan, 1979) </ref> occurs in practically all reading, although it is more prevalent in more fanciful texts.

Reference-contexts: Early examples such as PAM (Wilensky, 1981) and SAM <ref> (Cullingford, 1981) </ref> were narrow attempts to handle scenario understanding through plans and scripts. They did not try to benefit from other aspects of the reading process; furthermore, they dealt with extremely short narratives.

Reference-contexts: Systems which were successful at levels beyond the syntactic were limited to a small set of researcher generated texts and were unable to scale up to more realistic problem domains (e.g., BORIS, Dyer, 1983). Other systems <ref> (e.g., FRUMP, DeJong, 1982) </ref> tried for a wide coverage of texts but had to sacrifice high-level reasoning. Each attempt focused on only a portion of the reading process, all of which were too small to be successful.

Reference-contexts: While these are not generally intended to be valid psychological models of creative processes, they can give insight into what sorts of processes need to be considered. Two such techniques designed for improving people's creative abilities are attribute listing and morphological synthesis. Attribute listing, Crawford's work <ref> (cited in Finke et al., 1992) </ref>, begins with a reasoner considering an object which they think can be the springboard to a new, creative artifact. Each of the object's primary attributes are examined, with the reasoner thinking about ways in which each could be manipulated. <p> Each of the object's primary attributes are examined, with the reasoner thinking about ways in which each could be manipulated. Finally, the reasoner filters out the manipulations which lead nowhere; those that remain are considered to be creative. Morphological synthesis, Allen's technique <ref> (cited in Finke et al., 1992) </ref>, begins in the same fashion as attribute listing. The reasoner considers both attributes and commonly accepted values for each. Then, new combinations of attributes and values are examined. The reasoner looks for unknown combinations which may prove to be creative.

Reference-contexts: While the van Dijk and Kintsch theory may be valid for explaining structured reading tasks, it is unable to handle pleasure reading. Author intent is also rarely handled. Authors intend for A critique of past reading research 31 text to be understood <ref> (for a recent discussion of this issue, see Gerrig, 1993) </ref>. Therefore, there is a large amount of redundant information contained in text. The need to skim and skip portions of the text is imperative, but many other theories fail to allow for this.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the role of problem solving can be to discover a better solution than the one known. To accomplish this, the reasoner needs to possess a critique as to why the current solution is not a viable one <ref> (Hammond, 1989) </ref>. The final algorithmic formulation of the problem solving process is shown in Figure 2. With this formalization of problem solving in place, we can now examine the phenomenon of creativity in more detail. Roughly, creativity can be divided into two large areas, invention and understanding.

Reference-contexts: No reader, for example, would have the time, memory, and other resources to read every single word of a story (even a short story) and consider the possible extrapolations and extensions resulting from each. The reader's current environment, knowledge, goals and tasks (Ram & Hunter, 1992), and cognitive resources <ref> (e.g., Just & Carpenter, 1992) </ref> interact to control the level of understanding which is attempted. Therefore, a comprehensive theory of the reading process must also explain when and why in-depth reading occurs, as well as when and why shallow reading, such as skimming or skipping text, occurs.

Appendix. </address>
Reference-contexts: Towards the other end of the spectrum, we have systems which had built-in heuristics for deciding what to manipulate and how far to carry the alterations. Turner's MINSTREL system is one such example; SWALE <ref> (Kass et al., 1986) </ref> is another well known one. Both could be considered to have done some degree of creative reasoning by appealing to these human-supplied control heuristics.

Reference-contexts: Earlier story understanding systems can also be described as operating with a supertask/task breakdown; they simply concentrated on a specific one. The purpose of CYRUS <ref> (Kolodner, 1984) </ref>, for example, was what we call the memory management supertask, ATNs were examples of our sentence processing supertask, and AQUA (Ram, 1991) concentrated on the explanation and reasoning supertask. <p> Other systems also concentrated on various narrow aspects of the total problem. CYRUS <ref> (Kolodner, 1984) </ref> concerned itself with the memory management issues, but slacked in the other aspects of reading. Not all story understanding systems overlooked the story structure or the sentence level as an aid.

Reference-contexts: During the reading experience, multiple cases are being built. A case is a memory of a specific experience in the life of a reasoner <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>. First, there is the case representing the events of the story, a summary of what ISAAC understands of the text. Second, this case contains a subcase representing the flashback scene. Since it stands on its own as a separate event, it is an independent case.

Reference-contexts: Temporal research also included attempts to capture temporal metaphors, such as March is rapidly approaching <ref> (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) </ref>. Finally, there have been attempts to capture the information which would reside in the emotion column of our knowledge grid (e.g., O'Rorke & Ortony, 1992).

Reference-contexts: This meant that a huge amount of internal representation was required before reading could take place, placing a limit on the number of stories which could be read. Later systems tried to vary the reading depth, such as IPP <ref> (Lebowitz, 1983) </ref> and AQUA (Ram, 1991). Unfortunately, IPP failed to do any high-level reasoning, such as explanation of anomalies. AQUA added the explanation and reasoning supertask, as well as some of the memory supertask, but it ignored the story structure aspects which could have been a valuable aid.

Reference-contexts: Various approaches have been taken to attempt to minimize this problem in other systems which attempted to be creative by some metric. One end of the spectrum is to have the system do little self-monitoring; this approach can be seen in Lenat's AM system <ref> (Lenat, 1990) </ref>. AM was a system which discovered new mathematical ideas through a process of exploration and constraint manipulation. It was unable to do much filtering, however, as Lenat himself would sift through the output to point out to AM what concepts were worth exploring.

Later research showed that the idea of constraints was an important one (Sacerdoti, 1974; Sussman, 1973). These are conditions which cannot be violated in the final solution to a given problem.

Reference-contexts: While metacognition is important, many psychological results have shown that humans do not have total access to internal processes <ref> (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977) </ref>. In our model, metacontrol and metareasoning only have access to supertasks, not to individual tasks.

Reference-contexts: Still, most of the extensions to the original work generally expand the theory at the low-level. The two most significant high-level concepts which are still not handled are creative reading and treatment of the author's intent. It has been shown that creativity is linked to reading comprehension <ref> (Popov, 1993) </ref> and this has always been our contention. No other existing theory of reading has attempted to handle this aspect of reading, even though education has long recognized its significance.

Reference-contexts: Earlier story understanding systems can also be described as operating with a supertask/task breakdown; they simply concentrated on a specific one. The purpose of CYRUS (Kolodner, 1984), for example, was what we call the memory management supertask, ATNs were examples of our sentence processing supertask, and AQUA <ref> (Ram, 1991) </ref> concentrated on the explanation and reasoning supertask. These systems either ignored the other reading tasks or only implemented them at a level sufficient to demonstrate the performance of the ones being highlighted. 3.1 The reading task decomposition We have identified six supertasks necessary for complete textual understanding. <p> This meant that a huge amount of internal representation was required before reading could take place, placing a limit on the number of stories which could be read. Later systems tried to vary the reading depth, such as IPP (Lebowitz, 1983) and AQUA <ref> (Ram, 1991) </ref>. Unfortunately, IPP failed to do any high-level reasoning, such as explanation of anomalies. AQUA added the explanation and reasoning supertask, as well as some of the memory supertask, but it ignored the story structure aspects which could have been a valuable aid.

Reference-contexts: Metareasoning results from keeping explicit representations of the reasoning processes occurring during the cognitive activity. These reasoning traces can then be reasoned about, much like any other piece of knowledge within a cognitive agent <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1993) </ref>. This functionality enables a reader to reflect on their own reasoning, thus enabling them to learn more from the experience. <p> While most systems restricted themselves to strict reliance on world knowledge, there were some exceptions. AQUA built explanations of scenarios which it did not possess knowledge of, such as terrorist suicide bombings. Meta-AQUA <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1993) </ref> attempts to modify its world knowledge in pursuit of the interpretation which holds more of the story coherently together. Looking over past systems, one can see that the ones which performed some level of creative understanding were presented as learning systems, for the most part.

Reference-contexts: No reader, for example, would have the time, memory, and other resources to read every single word of a story (even a short story) and consider the possible extrapolations and extensions resulting from each. The reader's current environment, knowledge, goals and tasks <ref> (Ram & Hunter, 1992) </ref>, and cognitive resources (e.g., Just & Carpenter, 1992) interact to control the level of understanding which is attempted.

Reference-contexts: CYRUS (Kolodner, 1984) concerned itself with the memory management issues, but slacked in the other aspects of reading. Not all story understanding systems overlooked the story structure or the sentence level as an aid. For example, story grammar theory <ref> (Rumelhart, 1977) </ref> explains stories much like our story structure supertask doesthey are coherent text passages with characters, a setting, and a series of actions (the plot description). Unfortunately, story grammars do not go beyond this level; they ignore scenario understanding, sentence processing, and reasoning.

Reference-contexts: CYRUS attempted to cover all aspects of the grid to at least a shallow level of understanding. Other attempts have tried to capture the essence of temporal relationships. This includes work in real temporal reasoning <ref> (see, for example, Scerba, 1979) </ref>; for example, if you are told on Monday that something is due next week, when is it really due? Before the Friday four days away? Within seven days? Within eleven days (the second Friday)? Social conventions and background influence this type of reasoning the most.

Reference-contexts: At the lowest level, these models are simply the expected results for a given action and the expected preconditions which may have triggered the action; as such, they allow low-level inferencing to be performed (Schank et al., 1975). At their highest level, the local scenario models resemble scripts <ref> (Schank & Abelson, 1977) </ref>; they package together a set of expected preconditions and results which exist in various stereotypical events (such as going to a fast-food restaurant; or, as in the Men... example, the process of repairing a malfunctioning device by using field spares). <p> One axis of the grid represents a Schankian breakdown of knowledge: action, agent, state, and object <ref> (Schank & Abelson, 1977) </ref>. The other dimension represents a more-or-less natural breakdown: physical, mental, social, emotional, and temporal. For example, a TRANSfer is a generic action. In the physical column is the PTRANS of Schank's work, the mental column contains MTRANS, and the social column contains ATRANS.

Reference-contexts: The inclusion of this supertask is largely the result of the way in which reading is taught in this country for the types of text which are most familiar in the Western tradition <ref> (Smith, 1986) </ref>. While this area of the reading process may not be in-born or even learned at an early age, it does become automatic through our educational system. As such, it acts as a valuable aid in controlling and focusing the overall reading process.

Reference-contexts: For example, Orwell's 1984 (1949) is better understood if the reader is aware of the sociopolitical climate of the late 1940s, in which it was written. Reading teachers and researchers have broken comprehension down in an analogous way to our seven levels. Teaching reading textbooks <ref> (e.g., Strang et al., 1967) </ref> describe three levels of comprehension. The literal comprehension level is when the reader understands the literal meaning of the text. This level is represented in our breakdown by the first five levels and makes up the largest portion of reading comprehension.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to extend our earlier internal/external creativity description in an attempt to get at a better understanding of how a creative program would be judged. As described by Leary <ref> (as reported in Taylor, 1988) </ref>, it is possible to break creativity into the production of new concepts and the combination of existing concepts. <p> As described by Leary (as reported in Taylor, 1988), it is possible to break creativity into the production of new concepts and the combination of existing concepts.

Reference-contexts: Early examples such as PAM <ref> (Wilensky, 1981) </ref> and SAM (Cullingford, 1981) were narrow attempts to handle scenario understanding through plans and scripts. They did not try to benefit from other aspects of the reading process; furthermore, they dealt with extremely short narratives.

Reference-contexts: Allen (1979; 1983) and Wilensky (1981) were among the first to attempt this. Others included Carberry (1988) and Sidner (1985). Plan recognition is a powerful technique, particularly when the reader is able to understand the interactions of characters and their plans, rather than understanding a single character <ref> (Wilensky, 1983) </ref>. Still, it is too limiting to be a complete model of reading; a system concentrating on just plan recognition falls into the same trap as all the systems describedconcentrating on too small an area of the reading process.
