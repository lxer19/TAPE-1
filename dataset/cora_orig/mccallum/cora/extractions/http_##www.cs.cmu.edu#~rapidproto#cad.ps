Abstract: At Carnegie Mellon, we have designed and manufactured three generations of wearable, mobile computers. Each new generation of wearable computer has been designed within approximately one semester by an interdisciplinary design class taught at the Engineering Design Research Center (EDRC). Over the semesters that the course has been taught, an interdisciplinary concurrent design methodology has evolved. In this paper, we briefly present the design process for the Navigator, the third generation of wearable computers. We use this process to illustrate the needs of a multi-disciplinary design team, to anticipate the needs of a distributed design team using a novel manufacturing process, and to reflect on the interplay between the practice of design and the evolution of our design methods.

Reference-contexts: Rapid Prototyping Designers alternate between the abstract and the concrete <ref> (Adelson, 1985) </ref>; that is, a team's first ideas are turned into rough sketches, these sketches are evaluated, new ideas emerge, and more precise drawings are generated. This iterative process continues with soft mock-ups, appearance sketches, computer and shop prototypes, until finally the product is fabricated.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION At Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon), we have designed and manufactured three generations of wearable, mobile computers: VuMan 1 <ref> (Akella et al., 1992) </ref>, VuMan 2 (Smailagic and Siewiorek, 1993) and Navigator (Siewiorek et al., 1994). We are currently designing VuMan 3, a rugged, specialized computer for field maintenance, and Navigator 2, a general purpose, modular mobile computer with speech recognition and global positioning capabilities. <p> For example, a maintenance worker can view what is behind a wall by displaying the appropriate blueprint and can record maintenance actions as they are made. The first wearable computer designed and manufactured at Carnegie Mellon, the VuMan 1 <ref> (Akella et al., 1992) </ref>, is shown in Figure 1. Over a 12-week period during the summer of 1991 in conjunction with a Carnegie-Bosch Institute continuing education course, we conceived, designed and manufactured this first generation wearable computer.

Reference-contexts: use the principle of spiral development, in which the design problem and its solution evolve in parallel (Roozenburg and Cross, 1991), but the idea of participatory design has influenced our methodology. 13 Analytical Tools Although the availability of inexpensive, fast computers permits numerical prediction of complex phenomena not previously possible <ref> (Amon et al., 1992) </ref>, the analysis of many phenomena remains intractable in a design environment. This is especially true in concurrent design because of the stringent time constraints associated with the early design stages wherein large-scale simulations are too resource intensive and time consuming (Yesilyurt and Patera, 1994).

Reference-contexts: For some critical aspects of wearable computers, such as thermal analysis, we have developed analytical tools that let the designer study the effects of design decisions in the preliminary, detailed, and final stages of design <ref> (Amon et al., 1994) </ref>. An added difficulty is that we are designing novel products and, with the next generation, we will be using a novel manufacturing process. In both cases, the novelty reduces the number of commercial tools that are applicable within our design process.

Reference-contexts: The hardware and software groups worked closely together because their decisions were mutually dependent. The only satisfactory alternative for display was found to be the Private Eye <ref> (Becker, 1990) </ref> and it became the default. The group could not resolve other dependencies without further study. The team discussed resolved and unresolved design alternatives during the group presentations.

Reference-contexts: Designers spend only about ten to fifteen percent of their time on discipline-specific tasks <ref> (Bucciarelli, 1984) </ref>, the rest of their time is spent talking, writing, negotiating, meeting, searching, documenting, etc. Information exchange needs to be a guided activity not just an activity that designers are told they should do without guidance or encouragement.

Reference-contexts: We must begin to look at tools that support relationships rather than analytical tasks. As part of another research project, we have begun to work on a open network that will allow people to collaborate and share tools over the Internet <ref> (Coyne et al., 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Integrating computer-based tools has many of the same problems as creating design teams. Each tool comes with domain-dependent jargon and assumptions. The inability to share knowledge and information between tools is a large barrier to integrated design. Research is just beginning to address this issue <ref> (Cutkosky et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A three-dimensional geometric model that includes the electronic components and circuits is also required to perform an accurate thermal analysis. Most of the available tools, both commercial and academic, do not share common representations and do not inter-operate effectively. Previously, we have used a blackboard architecture <ref> (Erman et al., 1980) </ref> to address this problem (Finger et al., 1992); however, blackboard architectures assume a shared computational space (the blackboard), a shared product and process representation, and a well-defined control strategy.

When the design tools, the design process, and the manufacturing process are all changing rapidly, blackboard systems are not flexible enough.

Reference-contexts: The necessity of designing around flat boards has limited the degree to which the Navigator can be worn as opposed to carried. Future generations of wearable computers will take advantage of a new manufacturing process, called Shape Deposition, currently being developed at Carnegie Mellon <ref> (Hartmann et al., 1994) </ref>. Shape Deposition enables electronic components to be embedded within mechanical structures allowing for three-dimensional layouts and closer packing of components. Shape Deposition Manufacturing is a layered manufacturing process in which parts and assemblies are manufactured by successively depositing material in cross-sectional areas.

Reference-contexts: When considering tradeoffs, the designer needs to know the relationships among a product's attributes, for example between cost and quality, weight and durability, or performance and reliability. Concepts such as the house of quality <ref> (Hauser and Clausing, 1988) </ref> and total quality loss (Taguchi and Clausing, 1990) can be used to structure these tradeoffs. Understanding tradeoffs focuses a team's efforts on those product attributes most directly related to improving user satisfaction.

Reference-contexts: A new group formed to focus on speech recognition since this appeared to be the subsystem which was the least well understood and developed.

Both selections were due to the availability of local experts. The Intel 80x86 processor family was the processor of choice for Mach.

Reference-contexts: One aspect of tracking history involves automatic capture of the communication and design dependencies. The automatic capture of the information that forms the shared meaning for a team is the goal of n-dim, a system that is under development at the EDRC <ref> (Levy et al., 1993) </ref>. n-dim is based upon two observations about design, observations that are supported by our experiences in the wearable computer design projects: Progress in design is made by creating and refining a shared meaning of the requirements and of the potential solutions through negotiations, discussions, clarifications and evaluations.

Reference-contexts: Rapid prototyping can reduce the time and increase the quality of the iterations in the design cycle. Currently, we use prototypes to evaluate the designs as they evolve.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION At Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon), we have designed and manufactured three generations of wearable, mobile computers: VuMan 1 (Akella et al., 1992), VuMan 2 (Smailagic and Siewiorek, 1993) and Navigator <ref> (Siewiorek et al., 1994) </ref>. We are currently designing VuMan 3, a rugged, specialized computer for field maintenance, and Navigator 2, a general purpose, modular mobile computer with speech recognition and global positioning capabilities. Mobile computers are novel devices that allow users to merge their information space with their workspace. <p> Composed of only five 2 computer chips, VuMan 2 allows the user to select items from either a map, image database, or textual database using a hand-held, three button input device similar to a mouse. The demonstration application for the third mobile computer, Navigator <ref> (Siewiorek et al., 1994) </ref>, is also campus navigation. The Navigator, shown in Figure 3, allows hands-off operation with a speaker-independent, 200 word vocabulary continuous speech recognition system for input and has a head-worn display for output. <p> This methodology is described in more detail in <ref> (Siewiorek et al., 1994) </ref>. This design methodology has its roots in electronic design, which has been the driving factor for wearable computers. The goal of the design methodology is to allow as much concurrency as possible in the design process. Concurrency is sought in both time and resources.

The second mobile computer, VuMan 2, also shown in Figure 2, developed during the fall quarter of 1992, is dedicated to campus navigation <ref> (Smailagic and Siewiorek, 1993) </ref>. Compared to VuMan 1, it was cheaper, lighter, simpler, and consumed less power, as shown in Figure 2.
