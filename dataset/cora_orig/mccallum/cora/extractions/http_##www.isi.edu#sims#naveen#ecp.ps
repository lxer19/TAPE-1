Abstract: Information gathering agents can automate the task of retrieving and integrating data from a large number of diverse information sources. The key issue in their performance is efficient query planning that minimizes the number of information sources used to answer a query. Previous work on query planning has considered generating information gathering plans solely based on compile-time analysis of the query and the models of the information sources. We argue that at compile-time it may not be possible to generate an efficient plan for retrieving the requested information because of the large number of possibly relevant sources. We describe an approach that naturally extends query planning to use run-time information to optimize queries that involve many sources. First, we describe an algorithm for generating a discrimination matrix, which is a data structure that identifies the information that can be sensed at run-time to optimize a query plan. Next, we describe how the discrimination matrix is used to decide which of the possible run-time sensing actions to perform. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach yields significant savings (over 90% for some queries) in a real-world task. fl The first and second authors is supported in part by Rome Laboratory of the Air Force Systems Command and the Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract no.

Reference-contexts: To answer queries efficiently, an information agent must be able to determine precisely which information sources are relevant to a given query, and to retrieve as little data as possible from the relevant sources.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm for the numeric roles has the same computational complexity. Note that complexity of the entailment checks done in the algorithm may be exponential in the size of the concept hierarchy <ref> [ Borgida and Patel-Schneider, 1994 ] </ref> , but not in the number of information sources. 4 Using the Discrimination Matrix In the previous section we described how to perform the required preprocessing of a domain to identify the potentially useful discriminating queries.

The sensing actions are in the context of a software agent that can manipulate the environment as well as gather information.

Finally, the previous work by both Knoblock [ 1995 ] and Levy <ref> [ Levy et al., 1996 ] </ref> presents more limited types of sensing for information gathering that exploit subqueries already in a query, but do not introduce new subqueries. 7 Limitations There are two potential limitations to the use of discriminating queries in information gathering plans.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present a more general information gathering framework for automatically inserting useful sensing goals. 12 This work is also related to a variety of work on sensing in planning. In terms of the taxonomy of different uses of sensing proposed by Olawsky and Gini <ref> [ Olawsky and Gini, 1990 ] </ref> , our approach to sensing corresponds to deferring planning decisions that depend on sensor readings (i.e., the choice of which sources to query).
