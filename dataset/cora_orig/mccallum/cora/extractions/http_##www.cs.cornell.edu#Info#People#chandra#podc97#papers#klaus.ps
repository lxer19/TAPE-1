Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of synchronizing the rate of clocks in a fault-tolerant distributed system. Contrived to bring the rates of all non-faulty clocks in accordance, rate synchronization algorithms are very similar to usual "state" synchronization ones. Major differences, however, arise from the fact that the quantities to be synchronized are not directly accessible and that they do not proceed linearly with time. Relying on an interval-based paradigm, we introduce a basic system model and suitable building blocks for a generic rate synchronization algorithm that employs a convergence function. Our rigorous analysis of the mutual rate deviation (aka. consonance) and deviation from the ideal rate of 1 Sec/sec (aka. drift) reveals that the clock rate stability

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we are seeking for a characterization of f p (t) including deterministic influences (e.g. temperature, aging, pressure, humidity, magnetism, shock, power supply change, load impedance, radiation) and stochastic ones (e.g. white noise, flicker noise, random walk), cf. <ref> [A87] </ref>. For our purpose, we capture the frequency variation as follows: Suppose oscillator O p has instantaneous frequency f p (t) at some real time t and f p (t + t) at t + t.

Reference-contexts: Such nodes have their clocks disciplined towards a reference frequency obtained from atomic clocks or receivers for WWV, DCF77, or GPS, cf. <ref> [Dan97] </ref>. Obviously, their local rate intervals and consequently their contributing remote rate intervals are of short lengths compared to the ones from non-primary nodes N 00 .

Reference-contexts: Values for * max can ei ther be fixed a priori or, preferable, measured on-line with round-trip oriented protocols. For a long haul network it is typically in the ms-range, and for LANs with a shared broadcast channel in the s-range with appropriate hardware support, cf. <ref> [HSS97] </ref>. 3 Building Blocks This section presents the building blocks for clock rate synchronization by introducing notations and definitions as well as proving useful technical lemmas using O-expressions 1 whose purpose is to specify the order of magnitude of terms that can be neglected in practice.
