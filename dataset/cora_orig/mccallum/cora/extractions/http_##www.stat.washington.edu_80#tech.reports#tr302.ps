Reference-contexts: Our approach is approximate in several respects. The method could be improved by using a better approximation to posterior model probabilities than that based on (8). The models considered here can be written as generalized linear models <ref> (Aitkin et al. 1989) </ref>, and so the more accurate approximations of Raftery (1996) should be applicable. Also, the MLE approximation (5) to the predictive distribution could be improved, perhaps by using a Laplace approximation to the integral (4) or by a Monte-Carlo method.

Reference-contexts: Note that the posterior probability of "no effect" can be viewed as an approximation to the posterior probability of the effect being "small", namely P (jj &lt; "), provided that " is at most about one-half of a standard error <ref> (Berger and Delampady 1987) </ref>. For V10 the posterior probability is 0.66, indicating weak evidence for an effect. This weak result is probably due to the fact that only about 3% of the patients had this condition.

Reference-contexts: However, under the partial likelihood framework predictive distribution functions usually take the form of a step function <ref> (Breslow 1975) </ref>, so the predictive ordinate pr (d j M; D B ) is difficult to compute. In the spirit of the log score, and of Cox's partial likelihood (1), we developed the partial predictive log score.

Reference-contexts: The most popular way of doing this is to use the Cox proportional hazards model <ref> (Cox 1972) </ref>, which allows different hazard rates for patients with different covariate vectors, and leaves the underlying common baseline hazard rate unspecified. The parameters are estimated and standard errors found using the partial likelihood (Section 4.1).

Reference-contexts: Efroymson (1960) combined forward and backward selection to create stepwise selection, where each step can be an addition or a deletion of a variable. This seems to be the most popular method for Cox proportional hazard models <ref> (e.g. Fleming and Harrington 1991) </ref>. There is a large literature on variable selection procedures in the context of multiple linear regression. Many of the popular regression textbooks (e.g. <p> Equation (1) assumes that there are no ties between the times at which deaths occur; when there are ties modifications are necessary, but for simplicity we do not consider these modifications here. There are several ways of checking the proportional hazard assumptions, mostly based on the martingale residuals <ref> (Fleming and Harrington 1991) </ref>. 4.2 Bayesian Model Averaging Once the Cox model has been chosen, modelling consists of choosing the independent variables.

Reference-contexts: Selection methods which minimize a particular criterion tend to overestimate the true population value. For linear regression, stepwise methods often give highly significant values for R 2 when the explanatory variables are pure noise <ref> (Freedman 1983) </ref>. 2. Level of testing procedure unknown. Stepwise procedures are in essence a sequential application of significance tests at a specified level (a level pre-designated by the analyst).

Reference-contexts: We build the model by applying the procedures outlined above to the first half of the data, and then we predict the survival of each member of the second half of the data. Ideally, we would then assess predictive performance by a log score based on a predictive ordinate <ref> (Good 1952) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Standard rules of thumb for interpreting this posterior probability are as follows: &lt; 50%: evidence against the effect; 50 75%: weak evidence for the effect; 75 95%: positive evidence; 95 99%: strong evidence; and &gt; 99%: very strong evidence <ref> (Kass and Raftery 1995) </ref>. 4.6 Assessment of Predictive Performance We assess the value of our method (BMA) as opposed to that of competing methods (e.g. stepwise variable selection) on the basis of their predictive performance. To measure predictive performance we randomly split the data into two halves.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, such a threshold will exclude noise variables and include relevant ones. Procedures suggested for survival analysis include setting a threshold for the Wald statistic or a variation thereof, using its asymptotic distribution <ref> (Peduzzi, Hardy, and Holford 1980) </ref> so that its P-value is no greater than a pre-determined level. There is no consensus on what that level should be. 4. Selection of noise variables.

Reference-contexts: For V10 the posterior probability is 0.66, indicating weak evidence for an effect. This weak result is probably due to the fact that only about 3% of the patients had this condition. However, this variable is known from previous studies to have an effect <ref> (Wolf, Abbott, and Kannel 1987) </ref>, and so the prior probability of an effect should be set much higher, perhaps equal to or near 1, as discussed in Section 4.4.
