Abstract: M.I.T. Media Lab Perceptual Computing Group Technical Report No. 246 Abstract: A method for incorporating intensity edge information into the recovery of occlusion regions using a pixel-based stereo algorithm is presented. We review the construction of disparity-space images and their use to solve the stereo occlusion problem. We show the impact of intensity edges on the disparity space images, and extend our stereo technique to use information about intensity discontinuities at occlusion edges. Our approach suggests that for occlusion region analysis, two separate computations and results one for right occlusion regions and one for left occlusion regions maybe preferable to conventional cyclopean processing.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Accurate occlusion recovery is one of the most valuable tasks a stereo algorithm can perform. Occlusion separates the world into "layers" | three-dimensionally isolated regions | which can be the basis for a natural decomposition of a scene <ref> [13] </ref>. Unfortunately, the focus of stereo research has been obtaining dense, accurate depth maps of scenes, with occlusion analysis generally treated as an afterthought, postponed until stereo matching is complete. <p> For many, if not most, applications qualitative information that segments the scene into layers is more useful than precise, quantitative depth measurement. Object segmentation, motion analysis, object recognition, and image coding algorithms would all benefit from depth layering that preserves sharp `silouhette" discontinuity boundaries <ref> [13] </ref>. Most previous work on detecting depth discontinuities in stereo (e.g. [6]) proposes some operation on the recovered depth map. For example, Terzopolous proposed a thin-metal plate interpolation technique [12] and fracturing the plate at areas of high strain. <p> We have just begun to explore the idea of stereo layers and have not yet constructed methods for using the occlusion maps to define the layers. Also, because the idea of layers becomes particularly useful when consid ering image sequences <ref> [13] </ref> we will need to consider any interaction between layers defined by motion and those defined by stereo. 9 (a) (c) 10 5 Summary We have proposed an extension to our previous work on finding stereo matches and occlusion regions using a pixel-based approach.
