Abstract: Periodicity search, that is, search for cyclicity in time-related databases, is an interesting data mining problem. Most previous studies have been on finding full-cycle periodicity for all the segments in the selected sequences of the data, that is, if a sequence is periodic, all the points or segments in the period repeat. However, it is often useful to mine segment-wise or point-wise periodicity in time-related data sets. In this study, we integrate data cube and Apriori data mining techniques for mining segment-wise periodicity in regard to a fixed length period and show that data cube provides an efficient structure and a convenient way for interactive mining of multiple-level periodicity.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we develop an efficient method for mining multiple-level segment-wise periodicity in time-related database by integration of three techniques: (1) data cube structure (Chaudhuri & Dayal 1997), (2) a bit-mapping technique, and (3) the Apriori mining technique <ref> (Agrawal & Srikant 1994) </ref>. It shows that data cube structure provides an efficient and effective structure not only for on-line analytical processing (OLAP) but also for on-line analytical mining. <p> We observe an interesting property for cycle growth which is similar to the Apriori property at mining association rules <ref> (Agrawal & Srikant 1994) </ref>: if a k-cycle is frequent (i.e., passing the min conf threshold), all of its j-itemset for j &lt; k must be frequent as well.

Reference-contexts: The confidence threshold is set as 0.75. The concept hierarchies for time, location, and product are respectively: month ! quarter ! year, city ! country ! region, and product-name ! product-type. Moreover, profits can be generalized into several intervals based on an automatically generated numerical hierarchy <ref> (Han & Kamber 1998) </ref>. 2 To facilitate periodicity mining, we construct two data cubes, reference cube and working cube, as follows. First, a set of objects are collected based on the mining query. Associated with each object is a time series of a time-related attribute (e.g., profit).

It is useful to mine such kind of periodicity in many applications. Although there are many methods for mining full-cycle periodicity <ref> (Loether & McTavish 1993) </ref>, most of such methods are either inapplicable or prohibitively expensive at mining segment-wise periodicity due to the fact that the mixture of periodic and non-periodic segments in the same period will make the mining much difficult or costly.

Reference-contexts: It shows that data cube structure provides an efficient and effective structure not only for on-line analytical processing (OLAP) but also for on-line analytical mining. Notice although the problem of mining segment-wise periodicity shares some similarity with that of mining cyclic association rules <ref> (Ozden, Ramaswamy, & Silber-schatz 1998) </ref>, our study is not confined to perfect cyclic-ity but allows periodicity with certain confidence. Furthermore, the introduction of data cubes and bit-map techniques improves the efficiency of periodicity mining. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. <p> This technique, though straightforward, may require a lot of processing power. If the confidence threshold is 1 (perfect periodicity), many properties explored in <ref> (Ozden, Ramaswamy, & Silberschatz 1998) </ref> can be adopted to reduce the search effort. For example, if a time series is periodic with a period of p, it is periodic for any multiples of p.
