Reference-contexts: The inverse kinematics for a Philips OSCAR-6 anthropomorphic arm are included in the simderella distribution since this is the robot arm I use for my research. These algorithms (e.g., <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>). were developed initially with simmel and subsequently ported to control the real OSCAR-6 with only minor (mostly timing and error handling related) adaptations. <p> These algorithms (e.g., [1, 2, 3]). were developed initially with simmel and subsequently ported to control the real OSCAR-6 with only minor (mostly timing and error handling related) adaptations. For example, in the research reported in <ref> [1] </ref> the following algorithm is the heart of the neuro-controller, connel: 1. call get joint values () and get camera () (see below): two messages are being sent to simmel which after appropriate computation responds by communicating the relevant data (current joint values ~ and the object position ~x as seen

For the research in <ref> [3] </ref>, not only the observed object position is required, but also the apparent velocity and acceleration of the object due to motion of the (hand-held) camera.

Reference-contexts: The robot is described in a Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) matrix which is read in at startup. The assignment of frames to links is chosen in accordance with <ref> [4] </ref> (see figure 2). During normal operation, target joint values d , velocities _ d , and accelerations d (6 of each for a 6 degree-of-freedom robot) are received from the robot socket connected to the controller. The values d , _ d , and d specify the new path.
