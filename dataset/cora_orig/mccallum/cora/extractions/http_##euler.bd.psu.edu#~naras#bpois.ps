Reference-contexts: These are the constants d (h 1 ); d (h 2 ); : : : ; d (h m ) in <ref> [1] </ref>. The user must supply constants-of-proportionality if more than one chain is used. bugs-data-variables holds a list of strings that name the variables listed in the BUGS data file. bugs-data-values holds a two-dimensional array of values specified in the BUGS data file. <p> Default is all. reciprocal-h-mix-at-data-points is a two-dimensional array holding 1=h mix (data [i; j]). See [3]. weight-watcher-object holds a weight-watcher plot object. importance-weights holds the importance weights w [i; j], 0 i &lt; m and 0 j &lt; n, used for the Reweighting Mixtures (RM) scheme. See <ref> [1] </ref> and [3]. lazy is a slot used for efficient synchronization. <p> Root chunk (not used in this document). Chapter 11 Examples This chapter contains several examples of sensitivity analyses that we have done using our software. Although the focus of our paper <ref> [1] </ref> is on a regression model, the software is flexible enough to be used for other models. <p> To calculate the posterior at the data point, these macros are provided and they have exactly the same meaning as in the technical report <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Those who wish to modify the program for a different model should see the examples in chapter 11. This document is available in three forms: Postscript, Hyper-Dvi, and HTML. The HTML version can be viewed on the World Wide Web using a browser; see <ref> [2] </ref>. The Hyper-Dvi version is best viewed using Xhdvi (see [4]), although ordinary Xdvi should also be usable if you ignore the warnings that will be sent to standard error. We wish to remark that this software only does sensitvity analysis.

Reference-contexts: However, certain classes of models can be handled reasonably well and limited facilites for running chains induced by such models might be incorporated in a future version of our software. At this time, at least among Bayesians, the program BUGS <ref> [10] </ref> along with convergence checking aids like CODA enjoys some popularity and one can use it to run Gibbs Samplers. We recommend the use of BUGS and therefore have designed our programs to read and use BUGS input files. <p> Think of the output of each Markov Chain as a matrix M i = B B B fi 0 fi 1 : : : fi p1 . . . . . . (n1) (n1) (n1) 1 C C A Programs such as BUGS <ref> [10] </ref> produce output this matrix as one long array in row-major order. We only handle balanced data, i.e., same n for all Markov Chains.

Reference-contexts: Note that arrays are indexed from 0 so that index i refers to the i + 1-th position. In the current implementation, we exploit the c-double arrays introduced by Tierney <ref> [11] </ref>. Here then, is a description of all the slots in master-proto. identifier holds a string that is used to identify instances of the object. It need not be supplied by the user, although it is recommended that the user do so.

Reference-contexts: Our implementation is deliberately a simple one since there are more advanced implementations being developed, in particular, the one by Frederic Udina <ref> [12] </ref>. When the more advanced implementation is complete, we will just drop the new one in.

Reference-contexts: It is not bullet-proof. The proper way is, of course, to write a parser for this using the readtable and a future version will undoubtedly have this feature. For now, we assume the existence of Perl <ref> [13] </ref> and use it to convert the data file to a format which Lisp-Stat can parse easily. A Rudimentary Perl translator The Perl program should basically convert constructs like list (..) into (..), ='s to spaces, c (..) to (..) and ,'s to spaces.
