Abstract: Mobile IP protocols allow mobile hosts to send and receive packets addressed with their home network IP address, regardless of the IP address of their current point of attachment in the Internet. While some recent work in Mobile IP focuses on a couple of specific routing optimizations for sending packets to and from mobile hosts [Joh96] [Mon96], we show that a variety of different optimizations are appropriate in different circumstances. The best choice, which may vary on a connection-by-connection or even on a packet-by-packet basis, depends on three factors: the characteristics the protocol should optimize, the permissiveness of the networks over which the packets travel, and the level of mobile-awareness of the hosts with which the mobile host corresponds. Of the sixteen possible routing choices that we identify, we describe the seven that are most useful and discuss their benefits and limitations. These optimizations range from the most costly, which provides completely transparent mobility in all networks, to the most economical, which does not attempt to conceal location information. In particular, hosts should retain the option to communicate conventionally without using Mobile IP whenever appropriate. Further, we show that all optimizations can be described using a 4x4 grid of packet characteristics. This makes it easier for a mobile host, through a series of tests, to determine which of the currently available optimizations is the best to use for any given correspondent host.

Reference-contexts: It is impractical for mobile hosts to assume that foreign agent services will be available everywhere. Fortunately it is not difficult for mobile hosts to provide their own mobility support in the absence of foreign agents <ref> [Bak96] </ref>. Foreign agents may be able to provide useful services to mobile hosts, but they also restrict the freedom of the mobile host to choose from the full range of possible optimizations.

Of these protocols, the protocol specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [Per96a] has become the most popular.

Reference-contexts: Since its inception in the early 1970s, one of the most important guiding principles of the Internet has been to seek general-purpose solutions that work for all network technologies, not special-purpose hardwarespecific solutions <ref> [Cer74] </ref>. Similarly, mobility solutions that require widespread changes at layers above IP would be highly impractical. The challenge for supporting mobility at the IP layer is handling address changes.

Reference-contexts: home address delivery method to use is to start with the most conservative (Out-IE), and then over the lifetime of the conversation tentatively try each of the more aggressive options (Out-DE and Out-DH), at each stage being prepared to return to the conservative method if the more aggressive method fails <ref> [Fox96] </ref>. Unfortunately, this can be wasteful, because in many cases either one or both of Out-DH and Out-DE will work fine, and having every conversation start out overly conservative is wasteful.

Reference-contexts: It would be more efficient if a correspondent host could discover that the mobile host is nearby, and send the packets directly to it. A correspondent host that is aware of mobility issues should be allowed to do this. We and others <ref> [Joh96] </ref> have approached this problem by developing an optional routing optimization mechanism to avoid the overhead of indirect delivery via the home agent, as shown in Figure 5 .

Reference-contexts: Packets appearing on such a tail circuit with source addresses belonging to a foreign network normally indicate some inappropriate use of the network, and would be discarded by the router. The solution to these problems, which has also been described in <ref> [Mon96] </ref> , is shown in Figure 3 . By having the mobile host encapsulate outgoing packets and send them via the home agent, the inner packets are protected from scrutiny by routers.

Reference-contexts: The IP specification makes no promises about the path that packets will take, and much of the current Internet backbone already routes packets going in different directions over different paths <ref> [Par96] </ref>. The IETF Mobile IP proposal says that mobile hosts may connect directly to the visited network or indirectly via a foreign agent. When connecting via a foreign agent, the home agent tunnels packets to this foreign agent, which decapsulates them and delivers the enclosed packet to the mobile host.

Reference-contexts: When a smart correspondent looks up a host name and sees that it has a temporary address record in addition to the normal permanent address record, it then knows that it has the option to send packets directly to that temporary address. It has also been proposed <ref> [Per96b] </ref> that support for route optimization should be included in the base IPv6 specification [RFC1883] for all IPv6 hosts. 3.3 Minimize Size In addition to the overhead that indirect delivery adds, encapsulation also adds overhead by increasing the size of the packets.

Reference-contexts: Outgoing Packets In this section we look at how to achieve our previously described optimization goals for outgoing packets from the mobile host. Although we could use loose source routing, this achieves little that cant be done equally well using an encapsulating header <ref> [Per96c] </ref>. Current IP routers typically handle packets with options much more slowly than they handle normal unadorned IP packets. In IPv6, source routing is performed exclusively using routing headers, which is equivalent to encapsulation.

Reference-contexts: In the discussion above, we tacitly assume that the IP layer has some way to tell whether delivery is succeeding or failing, but in current operating systems this information is not readily available. This is not a new problem. The Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Specification <ref> [RFC826] </ref>, written fourteen years ago, mentions the problem of stale ARP cache information.

Reference-contexts: The home agent is a machine on the mobile hosts home network that acts as a proxy on behalf of the mobile host for the duration of its absence. The home agent uses gratuitous proxy ARP <ref> [RFC1027] </ref> to capture all IP packets addressed to the mobile host. When packets addressed to the mobile host arrive on its home network, the home agent intercepts them and uses encapsulation (often called tunneling) to forward them to the mobile hosts current location, as shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: It has no choice, since until it has registered with the home agent the other Mobile IP delivery services are not available. Another case where applications should be given the option to bypass Mobile IP services is when using IP multicast <ref> [RFC1112] </ref>. One of the goals of IP multicast is to reduce unnecessary replication of network traffic. Tunneling multi-cast packets from the home network to the visited network is therefore a little self-defeating.

Reference-contexts: This connection may be obtained by connecting to an Ethernet segment and asking a friendly network administrator to assign an IP address to the visiting host; it may be obtained by connecting to an Ethernet segment and having an address assigned automatically by DHCP <ref> [RFC1541] </ref>, or the connection may be obtained via communication with an IETF foreign agent that has been placed on the network expressly for the purpose of supporting visiting mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: The problem with link layer solutions is that they are limited to a single medium. For example, one of the current ways of providing mobile Internet access is to use a cellular telephone and modem to dial into a central PPP <ref> [RFC1661] </ref> server. While this method provides connectivity (albeit at a cost of about 40 per minute), it is limited to a single technology cellular telephony.

Reference-contexts: Although adding an encapsulated IP header to the packet consumes slightly more space than a redesigned TCP header might, this overhead can be minimized by use of Generic Routing Encapsulation <ref> [RFC1702] </ref> or Minimal Encapsulation [Per95]. In addition, there is no need to invent a new namespace when the existing IP address namespace is already well understood, and we already have established mechanisms for allocating, assigning, and managing unique identifiers in that namespace. 3.

Reference-contexts: The most important of these optimizations, which foreign agents prevent, is the freedom to forgo the services of Mobile IP for communications that do not need them. A lot of work has been done to make protocols client-originated wherever possible. The trend towards using POP <ref> [RFC1725] </ref> to retrieve electronic mail is one such example. Mobile IP makes it possible to send packets addressed to a mobile host without knowing its current location and to be able to set up durable connections.

Reference-contexts: It has also been proposed [Per96b] that support for route optimization should be included in the base IPv6 specification <ref> [RFC1883] </ref> for all IPv6 hosts. 3.3 Minimize Size In addition to the overhead that indirect delivery adds, encapsulation also adds overhead by increasing the size of the packets. Encapsulation typically adds 20 bytes to the size of the packet in IPv4, and more in IPv6.

Reference-contexts: These factors affect the delivery latency and the load on the shared resources in the Internet. There are two constraints. The first is that we may not assume any special support from routers, except for normal IP routing. This constraint is motivated by the end-to-end argument <ref> [Sal84] </ref>, which states that we should not burden the network with functions that can be performed equally well, or better, at the endpoints.

Reference-contexts: Even if the IP address of a mobile hosts network interface changes when it moves from one network to another, the mobile host should be able to continue corresponding with other machines in the Internet. Most mobile IP protocols [Bla94] [Gup96] [Hag93] [Ioa93] [Myl93] [Per94] [Per96a] <ref> [Tas94] </ref> [Ter94] address this problem by allowing a mobile host to use its home network IP address no matter where it currently resides. Of these protocols, the protocol specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [Per96a] has become the most popular. <p> These are important facilities, but they should not be provided at the expense of the ability to operate with the efficiency of a normal Internet host. Some researchers <ref> [Tas94] </ref> have proposed a different approach to the mobility problem, by assigning a new unique permanent identifier to every host on the Internet. They propose rewriting transport protocols like TCP to identify connection endpoints using this new identifier instead of the location-dependent IP address.
