Abstract: At the beginning of each paper there must be a short and informative abstract. The word ABSTRACT must be capitalised and centered and starts after a six point vertical space below the institution and address block. The text of the abstract begins in the line immediately after its heading. The normal space between lines must be exactly 15 points. Leave a six point vertical space between the end of the abstract and the start of the main text. TITLE AND AUTHORS On the first page of the manuscript type the session and paper code (e.g. OG 9.9.9) flush left in 10 point letters on the first line. Then leave a six point vertical space (0.4 cm of blank space) below the session and paper code and type the title in bold capital 18 point letters. The title should be centered. Leave a six point vertical space between the title of the paper and the author(s) name(s) block. The author(s) name(s) are to be typed in upper and lower case with the initials and first letter of the family name capitalised. For multiple authors at different institutions, identify the authors by using superscript number(s) at the end of each authors name and preserve the superscript number(s) for the institution and address block. Leave a six point vertical space between the author(s) name(s) and a block giving the author(s) institutions(s), using the superscript number(s) at the beginning to identify the institution. The institution and address block should be italicised. Leave a 12 point vertical space between this part of the header and the abstract. In the case of large collaborations, the author list can be substituted by a collaboration name. The complete author and institution list of the collaboration should then be provided on a separate page, to be printed at the end of the volume. MANUSCRIPT TEXT The manuscript should be organised by major sections. Each major section begins at the left margin of the composition area, after the insertion of a six point vertical space after the last line of text. Do not leave an extra space before beginning to type the first paragraph of each major section. There should be no spaces between paragraphs. New paragraphs should start with a 1 cm indentation. The text should be right (i.e. fully) justified. Major Subsection Headings Major subsection headings have the first letter of each major word capitalised (initial capitalization) and underlined beginning at the left margin of the line. The heading is then placed so that there is a 6 point vertical space above and none below the subsection heading. The text is typed starting in the very next line after the subsection heading. Minor Subsection Headings. Minor subsection headings have the first letter of each major word capi-talised starting at the left margin and terminated with a period as if this were a sentence. The heading is placed so that there is a six point vertical space after the preceding paragraph. The text is typed starting two blank spaces after the subsection heading as illustrated here.
