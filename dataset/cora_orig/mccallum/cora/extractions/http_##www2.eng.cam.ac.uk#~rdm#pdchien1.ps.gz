Title: Auxilliary Variables for Markov Random Fields with Higher Order Interactions  
Author: Robin D. Morris 
Date: June 26, 1997  
Note: DRAFT  
Abstract: Markov Random Fields are widely used in many image processing applications. Recently the shortcomings of some of the simpler forms of these models have become apparent, and models based on larger neighbourhoods have been developed. When single-site updating methods are used with these models, a large number of iterations are required for convergence. The Swendsen-Wang algorithm and Partial Decoupling have been shown to give potentially enormous speed-up to computation with the simple Ising and Potts models. In this report we show how the same ideas can be used with binary Markov Random Fields with essentially any support to construct auxilliary variable algorithms. However, because of the complexity and certain characteristics of the models, the computational gains are marginal.

For a clique of size 3fi3 there are 512 configurations. When symmetries are removed, this reduces down to 51 classes. These classes are shown in figure 1. <p> These classes are shown in figure 1. By considering the energy associated with lines and edges, the 51 parameters in figure 1 were reduced down to functions of three parameters, representing boundary length (e), line length (l) and noise (n). The reader is referred to <ref> [1] </ref> for full details of this model. 2.3 Auxilliary variables for the `chien' model Conventionally, the probability of a configuration of an MRF is written in the following form p (x) = Z C ! That is, the total energy of the configuration is made up of a sum over all

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Markov Random Fields (MRFs) were introduced into the image procesing literature in 1984 <ref> [3] </ref>, and have since been widely used for many tasks, mainly in low level vision. <p> In statistical physics applications, where the aim is to simulate large interacting spin systems, the Swendsen-Wang (SW) algorithm [11] was developed to speed up the computation, especially at the critical point, when simulating the Ising [8] or Potts models. The Multi-Level Logistic model of <ref> [3] </ref> is just the Potts model, and so the SW algorithm is applicable in that case. However, it has become apparent that the Ising or Potts model does not capture the image characteristics that are important in segmentation tasks [10].

Reference-contexts: Despite the increase in computational power that has become available, and the inherent paralisation that can be applied to the computational algorithms, computation with MRF models and single-site updating algorithms (the usual forms of the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings <ref> [5] </ref> algorithms) is time consuming. In statistical physics applications, where the aim is to simulate large interacting spin systems, the Swendsen-Wang (SW) algorithm [11] was developed to speed up the computation, especially at the critical point, when simulating the Ising [8] or Potts models.

Reference-contexts: of the SW algorithm to dramatically speed up computation with the Ising or Potts model, in this report we investigate the use of the auxilliary variable approach applied to MRFs with long range interactions, both in the form used in the SW algorithm, and the partial decoupling approach proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> In this case a similar argument gives that neighbours in different states are constrained to remain in different states with probability 1 exp (fi). This forms `clusters' where neighbouring sites in the cluster must be in different states. Partial decoupling was introduced <ref> [6, 7] </ref> to overcome some problems with the basic form of the SW algorithm when simulating systems with data. In this case growing the clusters without taking any account of the data can be unhelpful, as the clusters are unlikely to reflect the structure in the data. <p> The idea behind partial decoupling is to reduce the probability that bonds will be placed, with the consequence that the clusters will not be independent, and so the colouring of the clusters themselves will have to be updated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> In [7] the ffi's were chosen to split the lattice up into regular blocks. In <ref> [6] </ref> the data was used to set the values of ffi to encourage clusters supported by the data.
