Abstract: In the recent years new protocols and algorithms have been proposed to guarantee performance and reliability in exchanging data in real-time communication networks, and new services have been presented to allow cooperative office work, distributed conferencing, etc. Less attention has been paid to how applications and, more generally, clients of real-time communication services can interact with the network in order to specify and negotiate the quality-of-service of a connection. We believe that this problem is going to become a key issue for the success of future distributed systems, since it affects both client and network performances. In this paper we present a new mechanism for the establishment of real-time connections in a quality-of-service network developed for the Tenet real-time protocol suite. By improving the information exchanged between the network and the clients, the model allows to reduce the complexity and the time required to establish a real-time connection, and increases the network utilization. Additionally, we introduced a new class of real-time communication service to support adaptive quality-of-service, in order to enhance the possibilities of the network to face congestion situations. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hi-tachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The number of applications that require a distributed computing system is increasing. In the case of large numerical computations, for example, the need for accessing higher computing power requires that a large number of computers can communicate and cooperate through a high-bandwidth communication system <ref> [BaST89] </ref>. In the same way, the success of multimedia services such as remote collaborative work and teleconferencing relies essentially on the availability of an efficient network [LiGh90]. Efficiency is generally measured in terms of communication bandwidth, reliability, and delay.

Reference-contexts: This flexibility can be introduced by exploiting the characteristics of real-time traffic. An idea emerging by the research community is that - 10 - future high-speed networks will have two different classes of clients for real-time communication services <ref> [ClSZ92] </ref>. Clients with firm quality-of-service requirements for their connections, who will not accept any degradation, albeit predictable, of the service provided by the network, and clients whose applications have less restrictive requirements. Let us consider now an application that needs to establish a deterministic real-time channel c a . <p> Of course the same procedure can be applied for the delay requirement, and in general to all the parameters specified by the clients. A similar idea of allowing flexible requirements has been proposed earlier <ref> [Topo90, ClSZ92] </ref>. However, the major difference is that in our approach the network is still - 11 - committed to guarantee a reliable and predictable service strictly within the performance ranges specified by the client.

Reference-contexts: a best-effort service but it is able to assure quality-of-service, the general form of the interaction between the client and the network necessitates an establishment phase, in which the client requests the network a connection characterized by some performance requirements and the network verifies whether this request can be accommodated <ref> [Ferr88] </ref>. In the Tenet real-time protocol suite [FeVe90, Ferr92], this phase can be summarized in the following steps: 1) The client determines the values of the communication parameters characterizing a connection to be established with one or more destination nodes.

In this model, a client asks the network for the establishment of a connection between the source and the destination nodes on which data will be routed in form of packets. <p> The establishment of a channel with guaranteed performances is assured only if the network is able to respect the expected figures. This is verified by executing a group of tests, a detailed description of which can be found in <ref> [FeVe90, Ferr92] </ref>. The main goal of these tests is to verify that each node on the path has enough resources to allow the respect of the expected performances without jeopardizing the already existing channels.
