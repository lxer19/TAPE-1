Abstract: Research supported by the PATH program, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Berkeley, under MOU-165. Jose M. del Castillo would like to thank the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science for the scholarship that has made this work possible. This paper is concerned with technical investigations of traffic operations on automated highways. Estimates are made of the steady-state capacity of such freeways, paying particular attention to the effect of entry and exit maneuvers. The possibility of scheduling departing vehicles appropriately into platoons to minimize extraneous maneuvers is investigated. Characteristics of urban areas likely to be candidates for automated freeways are discussed, and some shortcomings of automated freeways, vis-a-vis conventional freeways, are pointed out. Finally, some areas of future research needs are identified.

Reference-contexts: Very high capacity values are predicted, even with platoons of moderate length. The increase of capacity is not the only justification for the platooning concept. It is also claimed in the literature that platooning favors safety <ref> (e.g. Hitchcock, 1994) </ref>. This claim is based on the fact that the relative speed of collision between vehicles reaches a maximum for intermediate values of the distance between them, whereas it is small for both short and long distances.
