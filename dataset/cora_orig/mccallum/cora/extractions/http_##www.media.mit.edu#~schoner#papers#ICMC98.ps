Title: Data-driven Modeling and Synthesis of Acoustical Instruments

Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis and synthesis of acoustical instruments based on data-driven probabilistic inference modeling. Audio time series and boundary conditions of a played instrument are recorded and the non-linear mapping from the control data into the audio space is inferred using the general inference framework of Cluster-Weighted Modeling. The resulting model is used for real-time synthesis of audio sequences from new input data.

Reference-contexts: Dynamical systems theory shows that we can reconstruct a state space of a physical system that is homeomorphic to the actual state space using the input and output observables of the system along with their time lags (embedding space) <ref> [Takens, 1981, Casdagli, 1992] </ref>. The reconstructed space captures the dynamics of the entire system and its dimensionality may be chosen in such a way that it corresponds to the number of effective rather than actual degrees of freedom of the system. <p> While this approach is close to the techniques suggested by dynamic systems theory <ref> [Casdagli, 1992] </ref>, it suffered from instability due to the difference in characteristic time scales between control inputs and signal outputs. The time-domain approach models a particular realization of a process, not the process itself, and it retains perceptually irrelevant features such as phase information or unpredictable information such as noise.

Reference-contexts: The function f (x; fi m ) with un-known parameters fi m in general needs to be a linear coefficient model <ref> [Gershenfeld, 1998] </ref>, for example a polynomial model. The complexity of the local model is traded off against the complexity of the global architecture. In the case of polynomial expansion, there are two extreme forms that illustrate this trade-off.

Reference-contexts: The sinusoidal components corresponding to the partials are summed into a single audio signal. 3.2 Cluster-Weighted Modeling Cluster-Weighted Modeling (CWM) is an input/output inference framework based on probability density estimation of a joint set of feature (control) and target (spectral/audio) data. It is derived from hierarchical mixture-of-experts type architectures <ref> [Jordan and Jacobs, 1994] </ref> and can be interpreted as a flexible and transparent technique for approximating an arbitrary function. Clusters automatically "go to where the data is" and approximate subsets of the data space according to a smooth domain of influence (Fig.2). <p> We then use pseudo-inverses of the cluster weighted covariance matrices to update the local model parameters fi m .

Reference-contexts: We measure the violin bow position with a capacitive coupling technique that detects displacement current in a resistive antenna <ref> [Paradiso and Gershenfeld, 1997] </ref> and infer a bow velocity estimate by differentiation and Kalman filtering. We determine the distance between bow and bridge of the violin by the same technique. Bow pressure is inferred from the force exerted by the player's finger on a force-sensitive resistor mounted on the bow.
