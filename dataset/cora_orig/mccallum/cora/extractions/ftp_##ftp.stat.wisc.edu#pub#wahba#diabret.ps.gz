Reference-contexts: Such estimates are used to estimate the prevalence of the condition of interest in general populations and to study the sensitivity of p to the predictor variables, or, if possible, to combinations of them. The traditional GLIM models <ref> [1] </ref> do this by defining f (t), the logit, as 1 Using SS-ANOVA to examine risk factors Wang, Wahba, Gu, Klein and Klein and assuming that f is a simple parametric function of the components of t. <p> The components are uniquely determined given a set of averaging operators E ff , which average functions over the t ff in some specified way. For example, if t ff is a continuous variable in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then a possible choice for E ff is (E ff f )(t 1 ; ; t ff1 ; t ff+1 ; ; t d ) = 0 Other averaging operators include weighted sums over possible or observed values of t ff . <p> We will be analyzing four data sets, each of which illustrates some particular feature of this class of models. In each case the (continuous) predictor variables t 1 ; ; t d have been rescaled to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and we will use the averaging operator E = E ff defined in (1.9). We will only consider main effects and two factor interactions. We will employ the penalty functional J ff of (1.7) and a two dimensional relative J fffi to be defined below. <p> We need to make some definitions in order to define the terms in the particular ANOVA decomposition (1.8) that we will be using. Define the (linear) `trend' function (u) = u 1=2 for u 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and, for continuous functions g defined on [0; 1] let Bg stand for Bg = g (1) g (0). For future reference note that E R 1 will be used to define ANOVA and identifiability side conditions. <p> We need to make some definitions in order to define the terms in the particular ANOVA decomposition (1.8) that we will be using.

Reference-contexts: The analysis here is based on (a special case of) the smoothing spline ANOVA method for modeling and estimating f which appears in Wahba, Wang, Gu, Klein and Klein [2](WWGKK), and we have implemented the analysis via the publicly available code GRKPACK described in Wang <ref> [3] </ref>. The code itself is available from netlib@research.att.com in the gcv directory there, and through statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu. An SS-ANOVA estimate is a form of penalized likelihood estimate. We first note two important penalized likelihood estimates that appear in the literature. <p> f containing interaction terms as in (1.8) have a representation as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms in the model plus n (basis) functions, which can be constructed from the t (i), the reproducing kernels associated with the penalty functionals, and the smoothing parameters, see [11] [12] [4] [13][10] <ref> [3] </ref>. Given the smoothing parameters, the numerical problem of computing the minimizer f can be reduced to finding the coefficients of a representation for it as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms and the above mentioned basis functions. <p> The mathematics behind the representation of f , the numerical method for the minimization of I , the data-based choice of according to the iterative unbiased risk method, and the calculation of the confidence intervals is described in WWGKK. Further details are given in <ref> [3] </ref> and the documentation for GRKPACK. In the four data sets that we analyze below, there are between d = 2 and d = 4 predictor variables.

Reference-contexts: Then in the remainder of this introduction we describe the main features of SS-ANOVA in general and the details of the SS-ANOVA models in particular that we will be applying to the WESDR data. Major precursors of the work under discussion include O'Sullivan <ref> [4] </ref> and and O'Sullivan, Yandell and Raynor [5], who proposed a penalized log likelihood estimate for f based on 2 Using SS-ANOVA to examine risk factors Wang, Wahba, Gu, Klein and Klein thin plate splines. <p> ) with f containing interaction terms as in (1.8) have a representation as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms in the model plus n (basis) functions, which can be constructed from the t (i), the reproducing kernels associated with the penalty functionals, and the smoothing parameters, see [11] [12] <ref> [4] </ref> [13][10] [3].

Reference-contexts: These splines are useful in many contexts, and can be incorporated in an SS-ANOVA model [6][7], but are not employed in the present work. Hastie and Tibshirani <ref> [8] </ref> (see also other references there) discussed estimates of f of the form f (t) = f (t 1 ; ; t d ) = + ff=1 where the f ff are `smooth' functions obtained by some smoothing process, including the use of cubic smoothing splines.

Reference-contexts: The S code (Chambers and Hastie <ref> [9] </ref>) provides the facility for fitting models of the form (1.5). They also note that some of their work extends to the SS-ANOVA methods that we will be considering here.

Reference-contexts: Penalized likelihood methods with more general penalty functionals and unpenalized terms are discussed in <ref> [10] </ref>. Recent research has focussed on more general models for f which allow the explicit modeling and visualization of possible interactions between variables, via functional analysis of variance decompositions (to be described) and SS-ANOVA estimation methods. <p> Indicator functions for categorical variables may also be incorporated in the model. It is well known <ref> [10] </ref> that solutions to variational problems like the minimizer of I (y; f ) and generalizations to I (y; f ) with f containing interaction terms as in (1.8) have a representation as a linear combination of the unpenalized terms in the model plus n (basis) functions, which can be constructed

Reference-contexts: Objective methods for choosing the smoothing parameters are desirable. This paper and the code GRKPACK employ the iterative unbiased risk method given in Gu [14][15] for the non-Gaussian case and extended to the p smoothing parameter case = ( 1 ; ; p ) in Wang <ref> [18] </ref> and WWGKK. This method is a computable proxy for the Kullback-Liebler information distance from the estimate to the `truth', see [15][19] [2][20]. Thus, the method is attempting to choose the smoothing parameters to minimize the Kullback-Liebler information distance from the estimate f and the unknown `true' f . <p> In this work we use the Bayesian `confidence intervals' proposed in [24], adapted to the component-wise multiple smoothing parameter case in [7], to non-Gaussian data [25], and to the multiple smoothing parameter non-Gaussian case in <ref> [18] </ref> and WWGKK.

Reference-contexts: We remark that these confidence intervals are based on an across-the-function property that is, a 95% confidence interval has the property that, (approximately) the confidence intervals are expected to cover the true curve at about 95% of the n data points, see [25][3] <ref> [20] </ref>. We now proceed to the details of the particular models that we will be employing in the analysis of the WESDR data. We will be analyzing four data sets, each of which illustrates some particular feature of this class of models.

Journal of the American Medical Association, </journal> <volume> 260 </volume> <pages> 2864-2871, </pages> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: A third followup is currently in progress. Detailed descriptions of the data have been given in <ref> [26] </ref> and [27] and references there. In brief, a sample of 2990 diabetic patients was selected in an 11-county area in southern Wisconsin. This sample was composed of two groups. <p> One observation of glycosylated hemoglobin was recorded as 23.6%, which is much greater than the others. We decided to delete this influential observation. Our conclusions remain the same with this observation in the analysis. Klein et al <ref> [26] </ref> found, using GLIM, that glycosylated hemoglobin is the only significant predictor of incidence of retinopathy in older onset patients. Using GLIM as a screening tool, we found that the effect of age is not linear and that there is a strong interaction between age and glycosylated hemoglobin. <p> Klein et al <ref> [26] </ref> found that age, duration and glycosylated hemoglobin were significant in a GLIM model. Using GLIM, we found that the duration main effect of polynomials up to the cubic is significant and the bmi main effect of polynomials up to the quartic is significant. <p> Furthermore, the SS-ANOVA method can be used as a diagnostic tool [35]. After deleting participants with missing data, there were 374 participants in the older onset ID group qualified for inclusion in the analysis for `Progression'. Klein et al <ref> [26] </ref> found that age, duration, glycosylated hemoglobin and base-retinopathy-level are significant using a GLIM model. They concluded that the risk of progression is higher if duration is longer and if base-retinopathy-level is lower (less severe). <p> The estimates of fl 2 , fl 3 , fl 4 , fl 5 and their posterior standard deviations (inside parentheses) are 0.73 (0.35), -0.68 (0.37), -1.05 (0.40) and -0.17 (0.51). Our conclusions basically agree with Klein et al <ref> [26] </ref> with the following modifications: 1. The risk of progression of retinopathy increases with increasing duration of diabetes up to around 8 years and does not increase after that; 2. The effect of body mass index is small; 3.
