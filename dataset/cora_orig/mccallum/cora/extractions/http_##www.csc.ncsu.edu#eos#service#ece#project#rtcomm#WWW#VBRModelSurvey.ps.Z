Abstract: It is predicted that in the near future, the transport of compressed video will pervade computer networks. Variable bit-rate (VBR) encoded video is expected to become a significant source of network traffic, due to its advantages in statistical multiplexing gain and consistent video quality. Both systems analysts and developers need to assess and study the impact these sources will have on their networks and networking products. To this end, suitable statistical source models are required to analyze performance metrics such as packet loss, delay and jitter. This paper provides a survey of VBR source models which can be used to drive network simulations. The models are categorized into four groups: Markov Chain and Autoregressive, TES, Self-Similar and i.i.d/Analytical. We present models which have been used for VBR sources containing moderate to significant scene changes and moderate to full motion. A description of each model is given along with corresponding advantages and shortcomings. Comparisons are made based on the complexity of each model.

More specifically, VBR streams with similar aggregate loss, but significantly different mean time between losses (MTBL), might be perceived as having very different quality by the end user (This phenomena has been suggested in <ref> [8] </ref> and [43]). As a consequence, research is needed to determine how well useful these models are in predicting this metric. Another direction for further work is the performance of a model when using a smoother mechanism. A smoother reduces the source traffic bit-rate peak-to-mean ratio by injecting extra delay.

With regards to the question of the relative significance of the LRD component in VBR sequences, recent work by Hey-man and Lakshman <ref> [11] </ref> suggests that short busy periods (typical when multiplexing VBR sequences) and finite buffers cause a reset effect which, for the most part, negates any LRD effects.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recent development of standards for digital video compression, such as H.261 [3], H.263, <ref> [21] </ref> MPEG-1 [19] and MPEG-2 [20], has made it feasible to transport video data over computer communications networks. It is predicted that in the near future, transporting video over computer networks will become commonplace.

Reference-contexts: It is useful for video conference sequences with small to moderate motion and scene changes. The tricky part is to determine the appropriate quantization levels, a task that requires visual inspection of the empirical bit-rate distribution. 3.8 Block-based video conference model using AR processes Jabbari et al. <ref> [22] </ref> developed a block-based bit-rate model of a video encoder which adhered to the general MPEG syntax. The encoder differs from the recommended MPEG implementation in that the resolution is CCIR (720x480 pixels/frame) instead of SIF (360x240 pixels/field). Interlaced scanning is used, producing two fields for every frame. <p> The determination of the parameters for (19) is involved and is not included here; but details can be found in <ref> [22] </ref>. The average number of bits for block type i, within frame n , is given by where c i is the first order AR coefficient and g i is a Gaussian random variable. <p> Scene Change?

Reference-contexts: A software package called TEStool supports TES modeling via a graphical user interface which facilitates both algorithms and interactive searches for TES models [14]. Recently, Jelenkovic and Melamed <ref> [23] </ref> have developed an algorithm which largely automates the search process and invariably leads to a more accurate model than those obtained via human interaction. TESs ability to match marginal distributions exactly and approximate many autocorrelation functions makes it an excellent choice for constructing a source model.

Reference-contexts: One of the first investigations regarding the SMG of encoded video was done by Haskell, who found that a 2:1 gain was achievable when multiplexing the outputs of several AT&T Picturephone encoders [10]. The SMG of VBR sources has been further quantified in early works by Kishino <ref> [24] </ref>, Morrison [38] and Verbiest [45], where gains of up to 4:1 were obtained for simple sequences. 2.

Reference-contexts: This model is suitable for video conferences with no significant scene changes, since it does not model the scene changes explicitly. The model does rely on the use of a classical distribution (negative-binomial) in DAR; however, the empirical distribution could be used. Lucantoni, et al. <ref> [27] </ref> proposed a model using a discrete-state, continuous-time Markov Renewal Process (MRP), which they compared to the DAR model. This model is of the same vein as MMPP, but instead the bit-rate is fixed, not probabilistic. <p> We summarize the attributes of the models covered in this survey in Table 4. Table 4.

Reference-contexts: More specifically, VBR streams with similar aggregate loss, but significantly different mean time between losses (MTBL), might be perceived as having very different quality by the end user (This phenomena has been suggested in [8] and <ref> [43] </ref>). As a consequence, research is needed to determine how well useful these models are in predicting this metric. Another direction for further work is the performance of a model when using a smoother mechanism. A smoother reduces the source traffic bit-rate peak-to-mean ratio by injecting extra delay.
