Abstract: Many surfaces of objects in our world are bounded by planar bilaterally symmetric figures. When these figures are imaged under orthographic projection a skewed symmetric contour results. In this paper a new fast, local method to recover skewed symmetries from curve segments is proposed. It can be applied to complete as well as to occluded contours. Furthermore, the skewed symmetry property is employed to overcome fragmentation of a contour during segmentation.

Reference-contexts: If a skewed symmetric contour has more than one symmetry axis, it is called skew ambiguous. It is well known, that the process of generating a skewed symmetry can also be described as a oblique transformation followed by a two-dimensional rotation of a bilaterally symmetric contour (see e.g. <ref> [Fri86] </ref>). 1.2 Related Work Methods to find skewed symmetries are divided in local and global methods. Local methods consider pairs of curve points, while global methods work with global properties of the contour, generally moments. Friedberg [Fri86] describes a global method based on the first and second order moments to constrain <p> oblique transformation followed by a two-dimensional rotation of a bilaterally symmetric contour (see e.g. <ref> [Fri86] </ref>). 1.2 Related Work Methods to find skewed symmetries are divided in local and global methods. Local methods consider pairs of curve points, while global methods work with global properties of the contour, generally moments. Friedberg [Fri86] describes a global method based on the first and second order moments to constrain possible values of rotation and skew fi. All valid fi pairs are then tested for a skewed symmetry using a heuristic measure of symmetry.

Reference-contexts: The method of projection ([NB77]) is used to build symmetric curve points complying with the criterion, which are then grouped together. Since the method relies on curvature, it is subject to noise and can be applied only to contours with nonzero curvature. In <ref> [GB91] </ref> another local method is proposed based only on the tangent of curve points. They derive a condition yielding for any pair of curve points the parameters of the symmetry axis, assuming that they are indeed symmetric curve points. <p> No results are given and it is not obvious how well this algorithm performs. 3 2 A new method As argued in <ref> [GB91] </ref> global methods have the chance of being fast, since not pairs of contour points have to be considered. However, they inherently require a priori knowledge of all contour points of a skewed symmetry and hence suffer from occlusion and fragmentation of contours. Therefore, I adopt a local approach. <p> They are very favorable compared to other local methods. Ponce reports runtimes of about 30 17 (a) (b) skewed symmetric contours of the die. seconds in [Pon90], Gross and Bouldt in <ref> [GB91] </ref> a computation time between 30 and 60 seconds for the same contours of the die on a Sun 4 Sparc station. These results are hence a magnitude faster, even taking a performance difference of a factor 2 or 2.5 into account. <p> These results are hence a magnitude faster, even taking a performance difference of a factor 2 or 2.5 into account. As a local method is still slower then the global method in <ref> [GB91] </ref>, where the runtimes, again for the same contours, are between 0.44 and 0.95 seconds. 18 3.2 Occlusion In this section occlusion of varying degree is introduced to the same six contours.

Reference-contexts: When these figures are projected onto an image, this special property is generally lost. However, assuming orthographic projection (as an approximation to perspective) the image contour exhibits a skewed symmetry (see figure 1 for an example). This term was introduced by Kandade in <ref> [Kan81] </ref>, and he showed that the parameters of a skewed symmetry constrain the possible orientations of the projected surface bounded by the figure.

Reference-contexts: If the best axis is not straight enough, the contour is rejected as being not symmetric. They do not address the problem of multiple matches between conics for a given generator angle. Two other local methods make use of the Hough transform. The method described in <ref> [OAT88] </ref> uses a polygonal approximation of a region boundary. First, for pairs of straight line segments a Hough transform in the (; d)-space of possible symmetry axes is computed. A second Hough transform in the (; )-space examines the candidates found in the first step.

Reference-contexts: They report fast and reliable results on various contours. However, either the degree of skew symmetry has to be known in advance or higher order moments than necessary have to be used, which can be computed less reliably. A local method was proposed in <ref> [Pon90] </ref>. It exploits a necessary condition for two curve points to be symmetric based on the curvature and normal of the points.

Reference-contexts: A distribution is fit to these histograms and the generator angles yielding a standard deviation below a given threshold selected as resulting skewed symmetries. Another local method is reported in <ref> [SMM90] </ref> using a B-spline approximation for the contour. Employing the method of projection for each generator angle all conics of two B-splines are searched to find midpoints of elementary axis of symmetry. These elementary axes are then grouped to form a global symmetry axis. <p> Therefore, the projection is iterated for different generator angles and a straight line is fit to the resulting midpoints. For a correct generator angle this line fitting will result in a small approximation error. So far, the basic idea is similar to the method described in <ref> [SMM90] </ref>, except that no approximation of the contour is necessary. However, I will also deal with ambiguities within one strip (see next paragraph) and skew ambiguity. Also a possible fragmentation of the contour is handled with the second stage of the method. angle.

This method depends critically on the stable polygonal approximation, which is difficult to achieve. In <ref> [Yue90] </ref> Yuen proposes to perform a Hough transform for each generator angle. For each pair of curve points connected by a line of the given generator angle their midpoint is recorded and the Hough transform used to fit straight lines to these midpoints.
