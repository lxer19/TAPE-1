Abstract: This paper describes a qualitative domain theory for core phenomena in engineering thermodynamics, expressed in Qualitative Process theory. It represents many of the best features of domain models developed by our group over the past five years. It focuses on supporting system-level qualitative analyses of typical fluid and thermal systems, such as refrigerators and power plants. We use explicit modeling assumptions [3] to control the level of detail used in building models of specific scenarios. We begin by outlining the primitives of the specific QP modeling language. The bulk of the paper describes the domain model itself, highlighting our design choices, simplifications, and use of modeling assumptions. Next we demonstrate how this domain model can be used to build models of a variety of specific scenarios, including simplified versions of a refrigerator, a steam plant, and a thermal control system. Finally, we describe some planned extensions to the model.

Reference-contexts: These provide some indication of the amount of inferencing going on "under the hood". 20 Modeling heat exchangers correctly requires an alternate ontology for fluids|namely, our Molecular Collection Ontology, as discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>. 21 Understanding what happens in this situation is one of the hardest problems given at the U.S.

Reference-contexts: free), heat flows, and phase transitions between the liquid and gaseous phases. * Fine Grain: The FSThermo model provides more detailed perspectives of several phenomena, such as the role of portals in fluid systems and latent heat in boiling, than previous qualitative models. * Modeling Assumptions: The domain model of <ref> [3] </ref> demonstrated that modeling assumptions could be used to organize abstract, system-specific models. Here we use the same methodology to control a fine-grained model, showing that by varying the granularity appropriately, a quite intricate qualitative domain theory can still be efficiently used to answer questions. <p> Modeling a system described at the level of engineering blueprints is not yet feasible, since it requires formalization of the techniques engineers use to compute structural abstractions from structural descriptions <ref> [3] </ref>. However, an extremely abstract sketch of one proposed design is shown in Figure 58. We have assembled a scenario description for the core of this system. Figure 59 shows the portion which defines Loop-A of Figure 58.

Reference-contexts: The entailments of global modeling assumptions can be captured in part by propagation. For example, when globally considering Geometric-Properties, we want them to be locally considered for every Container. We express this by asserting: 19 In <ref> [4] </ref> global assumptions are represented as predicates on the distinguished symbol :SCENARIO, rather than as abstract tokens.

Reference-contexts: Several domain models for such systems have been described previously [5,3], but have various limitations. The FSThermo 1 domain model exhibits three important features: * Broad Coverage: Previous models (e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>) covered only a small subset of relevant phenomena. The FSThermo model captures a broader spectrum of phenomena.

Reference-contexts: The simplest model of a valve is binary, providing an on/off switch for fluid flow. This level of model can easily be achieved by introducing Blocked (see below) as an explicit assumption on a fluid path and using actions to correspond to changing its state <ref> [7] </ref>, so we do not discuss it further.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 begins by outlining some issues involved in building domain models. Next, Section 3 describes the modeling language we use. Specifically, the domain model is written in the language of QPE <ref> [8] </ref>, an envisioner for Qualitative Process theory. We assume a reading knowledge of QP theory: This section only describes some of the implementation-specific properties of this modeling language that are important in understanding how the domain model is used. Section 4 describes the FSThermo model itself. <p> Given a domain model, a structural description, and a collection (possibly empty) of modeling assumptions, QPE constructs a model of that scenario based on the constructs of the domain model, and produces a total envisionment of it. The details of how QPE works are described in <ref> [8] </ref>. This modeling language is quite close to the syntax used in the original QP papers, but has the advantage that it is executable. <p> The record of instances of processes and views are never erased, even though their existence is carefully predicated on the appropriate antecedents. 10 new constituents of state, see <ref> [8] </ref>). In particular, these relationships are often predicated on modeling assumptions, using the :conditions keyword. Owing to their role in defining domain models, we call such rules perspectives, and define them via defPerspective.

Reference-contexts: If we are trying to siphon water out of a tub, it is important to keep the inlet of the siphon below the water line. Following the terminology used by Hayes <ref> [10] </ref>, we call these interfaces portals. We consider portals to be distinct entities, whose existence depends on the connection between some form of fluid path and a container. The function PT maps from containers and paths to portals.

Reference-contexts: A more reasonable macroscopic model could be organized by representing the cavitation number, an estimate of the probability of cavitation. The cavitation number is defined as -2 1 where is density, is stream velocity, p is stream pressure, and p s is saturation pressure <ref> [18] </ref>. However, we have not yet explored the consequences of adding this construct. 4.4 Phase Transition Processes Many thermodynamic cycles involve phase changes. For example, most air conditioners and power plants involve the boiling or evaporation of liquids and the condensation of gasses. <p> There is no single quantitative model which completely covers either boiling or condensation. Boiling occurs in several distinct regimes, such as nucleate boiling versus film boiling, each of which can be further characterized (e.g., subcooled versus saturated nucleate boiling, or stable versus unstable film boiling) <ref> [18] </ref>. While these distinctions are important for many numerical prediction tasks, for our purposes it suffices to develop a simpler model which captures just the common features of the phenomena. What are the central phenomena we must capture? Examining what we know about simple cases provides a useful focus.
