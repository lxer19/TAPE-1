Abstract: Sound transmission through straight circular ducts with a uniform inviscid mean flow and a constant acoustic lining (impedance wall) is classically described by a modal expansion. A natural extension for ducts with axially slowly varying properties (diameter and mean flow, wall impedance) is a multiple-scales solution. It is shown in the present paper that a consistent approximation of boundary condition and isentropic mean flow allows the multiple-scales problem to have an exact solution. Since the calculational complexities are no more than for the classical straight duct model, the present solution provides an attractive alternative to a full numerical solution if diameter variation is relevant. A unique feature of the present solution is that it provides a systematic approximation to the hollow-to-annular cylinder transition problem in the turbo-fan engine inlet duct.

Reference-contexts: However, quite often, especially when the duct carries a mean flow, the diameter variations of the duct are only gradual thus introducing prospects of perturbation solutions. Indeed, several authors have utilized the small parameter related to the slow cross section variations (Eisenberg and Kao <ref> [1] </ref>; Tam [19]; Huerre and Karamcheti [4]; Thompson and Sen [22]).

Reference-contexts: The respective values are normalized to 1 at begin and end position. Since it is of interest to measure the amount of dissipated acoustic energy, we introduce here the acoustic power P of a single mode through a duct cross section. Following Goldstein <ref> [3] </ref>, we define the acoustic power at a surface S P = S where I is the time-averaged acoustic intensity or energy flux, here given by I = 1 2 Re [(p=D + r . rOE)(DrOE + aer) fl ]; with fl denoting the complex conjugate.

A particularly interesting and systematic approach is the method of multiple scales elaborated by Nayfeh and co-workers, both for ducts without (Nayfeh and Telionis [13]) and with flow (Nayfeh, Telionis and Lekoudis [14]; Nayfeh et al.[12]), and with hard and impedance walls.

Reference-contexts: (3.1) leading to (3.2)), we obtain the solution V 1 (X; r) = 2rD 0 (X) @X 1 (X) 2 (X) R 2 j The above solutions U 0 , P 0 , D 0 may be recognized as the well-known one dimensional gas flow equations (e.g., Liepmann et al. <ref> [7] </ref>). It should be stressed, however, that the radial velocity component V 1 is essential for a consistent mean flow description, and therefore necessary here. 4.

Reference-contexts: So this approach looks rather inefficient. Indeed, it is not necessary to work out the equations for A 1 in detail. We only need a solvability condition (Nayfeh <ref> [10] </ref>), sufficient to yield the required equation for N .

Reference-contexts: A somewhat puzzling aspect of Nayfeh et al.'s solutions was that without flow the differential equation for the slowly varying amplitude could be solved exactly, whereas with flow this was not the case. Also, in Rienstra <ref> [16] </ref> the amplitude equation for a similar problem of a duct with (slowly varying) porous walls could be solved exactly.

Reference-contexts: The multiple-scales technique provides a very natural generalization of modal solutions since a mode of a constant duct is now assumed to vary its shape according to the duct variations, in a way that amplitude and wave numbers are slowly varying functions, rather than constants. In Rienstra <ref> [18] </ref> we proceeded along these lines, and presented an explicit multiple-scales solution of a problem similar to the one considered previously by Nayfeh et al. <p> Also, in Rienstra [16] the amplitude equation for a similar problem of a duct with (slowly varying) porous walls could be solved exactly. In <ref> [18] </ref> we showed that, at least in the present type of problems, an exact solution appears to be the rule rather than an exception, if the entire perturbation analysis is consistent at all levels.
