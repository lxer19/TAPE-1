Abstract: This paper reports a preliminary investigation of the use of modern data mining tools for mortgage scoring. Using IBM's Intelligent Miner (a data mining toolbox), we built a model of serious delinquency on a sample of data from Mortgage Information Corporation's Loan Performance System, which contains over 20 million loans with a volume of over $1.6 trillion. Currently, two technologies prevail in mortgage scoring: logistic regression, a very old and very simple method, and neural networks, newer and more complex types of models that can be extremely difficult to interpret. The radial basis function (RBF) algorithm in Intelligent Miner combines the mathematical complexity and generality of neural networks with a comprehensible visualization that explains the RBF model. Due to the performance and understandability of the RBF model, as well as other unique technologies not described here, the Intelligent Miner should be a useful tool for mortgage bankers, facilitating development of customized systems for mortgage scoring and other mortgage banking applications.

Reference-contexts: With millions of real dollars at stake, the ability to understand the model is a necessity. Neural networks are very popular, but their opacity makes them a less than ideal tool <ref> (Barr & Bhagat 1994) </ref>. We believe that the ability of IBM's radial basis function technology to discover patterns and present them as easily understood graphs makes it an excellent tool for use in many areas of mortgage banking.

Reference-contexts: of data mining technologies in stock selection (John, Miller & Kerber 1996, John & Miller 1996, Apte & Hong 1995, Levin 1996), and now the mortgage industry is turning to this technology as well: 27% of large mortgage servicers identified data mining as the most important technology for the future <ref> (Lebowitz & Bechhoefer 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We chose to investigate whether a loan was seriously delinquent, which was defined as 90 days past due or foreclosure. 3 IBM Radial Basis Function Algorithm One kind of technology for data mining is radial basis function fitting <ref> (Ripley 1996, Ch. 4) </ref>. Radial basis function fitting addresses the supervised learning problem: given a database, build a model which allows the prediction of one target attribute given the rest.
