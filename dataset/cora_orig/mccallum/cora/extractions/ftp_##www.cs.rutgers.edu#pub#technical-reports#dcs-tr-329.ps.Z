Abstract: For each natural number m greater than one, and each natural number k less than or equal to m, there exists a root-finding iteration function, defined as the ratio of two determinants that depend on the first m k derivatives of the given function, and for k = 1 are Toeplitz determinants. In this paper we analyze the order of convergence of this fundamental family. For fixed m, as k increases, the order decreases from m to the positive root of the characteristic polynomial of generalized Fibonacci numbers of order m. For fixed k, the order increases in m. The asymptotic error constant is defined in terms of Toeplitz determinants. Newton's method, Halley's method, and their multipoint versions are members of the family.

Two major books that contain a complete proof are the book by Ostrowski <ref> [26] </ref>, and Traub [34]. Ostrowski gives a complete proof. However, his proof makes use of the specific way in which the iterates are defined, and the mean-value theorem (page 95). <p> We first need an auxiliary results (see Ostrowski <ref> [26] </ref> and Traub [34]): Lemma 2.

Reference-contexts: Before we begin the proofs, it should be mentioned that the problem of root-finding is extremely vast with many avenues still unexplored. Despite the fact that there are good practical and 4 theoretical methods for finding all roots of polynomials, e.g. see the recent paper by Pan <ref> [27] </ref>, there is no reason to believe that one cannot improve upon these algorithms.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the family, B (k) m , itself gives rise to new interesting problems, e.g. the analysis of regions of fast convergence, analogous to a corresponding region for polyno mial root-finding via Newton's method, derived by Smale <ref> [31] </ref>. In addition to the applications of B m and Theorem 2 for general root-finding problem to be developed next, there are other fundamental applications, e.g. in constructing non-iterative determinantal approximation to roots of numbers, , and e (see [24]).

Reference-contexts: Ford and Pennline [10] give a rational formulation of Gerlach's recursive approach in deriving iteration functions, but no closed formula is described. Indeed the one-point family, fB (1) m=2 , was derived by Traub <ref> [35] </ref> (page 130) as a special case of parameterized family of iteration function for polynomials, with the parameter value equal zero. Traub's motivation is to find high order iterative methods, which for large enough value of the parameter, converge globally to the dominant root of polynomials, assuming its uniqueness.

Reference-contexts: For historical development of Newton's method, sometimes referred as, "Newton Raphson" method, see <ref> [37] </ref>. For k = 1, B (k) 3 (a 3 ) is Halley's function, and for k = 2 and k = 3, it gives two and three-point variation of Halley's. The proof of Theorem 2, although based on a simple recursive procedure, is in fact quite tedious. <p> Its parallel complexity for the approximation of square root of numbers is discussed in [22].
