Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that attentional mechanisms may be required to successfully perform many vision tasks. This paper presents an attentional prototype for early visual processing. Our model is composed of a processing hierarchy and an attention beam that traverses the hierarchy, passing through the regions of greatest interest and inhibiting the regions that are not relevant. The type of input to the prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. Aspects of attention such as localizing spatial regions of interest and ordering their importance are addressed; other aspects of attention such as the role of task guidance are encompassed by the model but are not detailed here. Simulations using high-resolution digitized images were conducted, with oriented edge information as the input to the model. The results confirm that this prototype is both robust and fast, and promises to be essential to any real-time vision system.

Reference-contexts: In our model, constant time is required irrespective of the location of the sensory items. Anderson and van Essen have proposed the idea of "shifter networks" to explain attentional effects in vision <ref> [1] </ref>. This requires a two-phase process. First, a series of mi-croshifts map the attention focus onto the nearest cortical module. Then, a series of macroshifts switches dynamically between pairs of modules at the next stage, continuing in this fashion until an attentional centre is reached.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, 4 our model performs this function, which has also been ob-served in monkey visual cortex by Moran and Desimone [10]. Burt has developed an attention mechanism based on a multiresolution image pyramid <ref> [2] </ref>. A Gaussian pyramid is constructed by first taking the original image as the base level of the pyramid. The remaining levels are formed by first applying a low pass filter to the image below it in the pyramid, then subsampling by removing every other row and column.

Reference-contexts: Califano, Kjeldsen and Bolle have outlined a multires-olution system in which the input is processed simultaneously at a coarse resolution throughout the image and at a finer resolution within a small "window" <ref> [3] </ref>. An attention control mechanism directs the high-resolution spot. In many respects, our scheme may be considered a more general expansion of the Califano model. Our model, however, allows for many resolutions whereas Califano's is restricted to two.

Reference-contexts: For example, Chapman <ref> [4] </ref> has recently implemented a system based on the idea of a pyramid model of attention introduced by Koch and Ullman [8]. Chapman's model places a log-depth tree above a saliency map.

Reference-contexts: This pruning of visual information is essential if any hope of real-time performance is to be realized. Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. This strategy appears appropriate for the vast amounts of input data that must be processed at the low-level <ref> [7, 21] </ref>. However, complete parallelism is not possible because it requires too many processors and connections [13, 19]. Instead, a balance must be found between processor-intensive parallel techniques and time-intensive serial techniques.

Reference-contexts: The pass zone permeates the winners at each level and the inhibit zone encompasses those elements at each level that competed in the WTA process. This algorithm is similar to the basic idea proposed by Koch and Ullman <ref> [8] </ref>. One important difference is that our scheme does not rely on a saliency map. Another distinction is that we use a modified WTA update rule that allows for multiple winners and converges in constant time, independent of the number of elements 1 . <p> For example, Chapman [4] has recently implemented a system based on the idea of a pyramid model of attention introduced by Koch and Ullman <ref> [8] </ref>. Chapman's model places a log-depth tree above a saliency map. There are several difficulties with this approach, the most serious being that the focus of attention is not continuously variable.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the time required for Chapman's model is logarithmic in the maximum number of elements, making it impractical for high-resolution images. Further, the time required to process any item in a sensory field is dependent on its location, which is contrary to recent psychological evidence <ref> [9] </ref>. In our model, constant time is required irrespective of the location of the sensory items. Anderson and van Essen have proposed the idea of "shifter networks" to explain attentional effects in vision [1]. This requires a two-phase process.

Reference-contexts: These restrictions do not allow a "shrink wrapping" around an object, as it is attended to, from coarser to finer resolutions. In contrast, 4 our model performs this function, which has also been ob-served in monkey visual cortex by Moran and Desimone <ref> [10] </ref>. Burt has developed an attention mechanism based on a multiresolution image pyramid [2]. A Gaussian pyramid is constructed by first taking the original image as the base level of the pyramid.

Reference-contexts: Another difference is that Burt's mechanism does not allow irrelevant regions of the image to be inhibited. Finally, his model does not allow for different saliency measures. Several attentional schemes have been proposed by the connectionist community. Mozer describes a model of attention based on iterative relaxation <ref> [11] </ref>. Attentional selection is performed by a network of simple computing units that constructs a variable-diameter "spotlight" on the retinotopic representation. This spotlight allows sensory information within it to be preferentially processed.

Reference-contexts: The time required may be quite long if there are similar regions of activity that are widely separated. For example, Mozer reports that his scheme took up to 100 iterations to settle on a 36 fi 6 image <ref> [12] </ref>. These schemes are clearly not suited to real-world high-resolution images. Summary We have argued that an attention mechanism is a necessary component of a computer vision system if it is to perform tasks in a complex, real world.

Reference-contexts: The attention shifts discussed throughout this paper have been covert forms of attention in which different regions of the visual input have been attended. It is experimentally well established that these covert attention shifts occur in humans <ref> [14] </ref>. In a similar way, the human visual system has special fast mechanisms called saccades for moving the fovea to different spatial targets (overt attention).

Reference-contexts: This spotlight allows sensory information within it to be preferentially processed. San-don describes a model which also uses an iterative rule but performs the computation at several spatial scales simultaneously <ref> [15] </ref>. There are several shortcomings of iterative models such as these. One problem is that the settling time is quite sensitive to the size and nature of the image. The time required may be quite long if there are similar regions of activity that are widely separated.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the strongest or most salient features are attended to in order of the length of the line, much like Sha'ashua and Ullman's work on saliency of curvature <ref> [16] </ref>. The attention shifts discussed throughout this paper have been covert forms of attention in which different regions of the visual input have been attended. It is experimentally well established that these covert attention shifts occur in humans [14].

Reference-contexts: An attention mechanism guides selection of portions of the hierarchy from the most abstract level through to the lowest level. Spatial attentional influence is applied in a "spotlight" fashion at the top. The notion of a spotlight appears in many other models such as that of Treisman <ref> [17] </ref>. If the spotlight shines on a unit at the top of the hierarchy, however, there seems to be no mechanism for the rest of the selection to actually proceed through to the desired items to be selected.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Vision problems whose solution does not include attentional influences have been shown to be computationally intractable <ref> [18] </ref>. To ensure tractability, systems for computer vision must locate and analyze only the information essential to the current task and ignore the vast flow of irrelevant detail. This pruning of visual information is essential if any hope of real-time performance is to be realized.

This complexity analysis quantitatively confirms that selective attention is a major contributer in reducing the amount of computation in any vision system. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is loosely modelled after the increasing neurophysiology literature on single-cell recordings from awake and behaving primates. <p> Furthermore, the proposed scheme is loosely modelled after the increasing neurophysiology literature on single-cell recordings from awake and behaving primates.

The first pass of the WTA scheme is shown in Fig. 1 (b). This is accomplished by applying steps 5 and 6 of Algorithm 1 for each level of the hierarchy.
