Reference-contexts: ID3Inducer is a subclass of TDDTInducer that uses the ID3 algorithm to induce the decision tree [Qui86]. 6.3 OODGInducer and HOODGInducer OODGInducer (Oblivious, read-Once Decision Graph inducer) is an abstract base class and a subclass of Inducer. OODGInducer uses a bottom-up method for building levelled rooted decision graphs <ref> [Koh94] </ref>. If the environment variable OODGREMOVEDUP (which defaults to "yes") is set to "yes," conflicting and duplicate instances are removed. num nodes () and num leaves () return the number of nodes and leaves respectively in the induced decision graph.
