Abstract: Translingual information retrieval (TIR) consists of providing a query in one language and searching document collections in one or more different languages. This paper introduces new TIR methods and reports on comparative TIR experiments with these new methods and with previously reported ones in a realistic setting. Methods fall into two categories: query translation based, and statistical-IR approaches establishing translingual associations. The results show that using bilingual corpora for automated extraction of term equivalences in context outperforms other methods. Translin- gual versions of the Generalized Vector Space Model (GVSM) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) perform relatively well, as does translin- gual pseudo relevance feedback (PRF). All showed relatively small performance loss between monolingual and translingual versions. Query translation based on a general machine- readable bilingual dictionary heretofore the most popular method did not match the performance of other, more sophisticated methods. Also, the previous very high LSI results in the literature were disconfirmed by more realistic relevance-based evaluations.

Reference-contexts: terms than phrases or sentences, our query-translation experiment is unable to exploit the power of EBMT. 2.2 Corpus-based Term Translation In order to create domain-specific or corpus-specific bilingual dictionaries automatically, we start from a large sentence-aligned bilingual corpus and generate a large term co-occurrence table combined with a thresholding scheme <ref> [ Brown, 1997 ] </ref> . The result was used as the dictionary for corpus-based (example-based) term substitution MT (EBT).

Reference-contexts: Should a term in one language co-occur with several terms in the other language with sufficient frequency to pass the conditional probability threshold, all are stored as candidate translations. 3 IR-based Methods for TIR We extended three monolingual retrieval methods to translingual retrieval: pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) <ref> [ Buckley et al., 1995 ] </ref> , the general vector space model (GVSM) [ Wong et al., 1985 ] , and the latent semantic indexing (LSI) approach [ Deerwester et al., 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: Let us consider the pros and cons of each approach: * Translation Accuracy Both human and machine translation <ref> [ Carbonell, 1985; Nirenburg et al., 1991 ] </ref> require context to achieve accuracy. Translating isolated words in a query is unreliable, due to unresolved lexical ambiguity.
