Reference-contexts: Such codes are called geometric Goppa or algebraic-geometric codes. If G and H are two divisors such that the difference is the principal divisor of a rational function which is 1 at the n rational points, then they define the same code. Xing <ref> [17] </ref> showed that the converse holds whenever deg (G) &lt; n=2 or deg (G) &gt; n=2 + 2g 2. An immediate consequence of such a result gives a characterization of divisors defining a self-dual code. <p> An immediate consequence of such a result gives a characterization of divisors defining a self-dual code. The question on self-dual codes was considered before by Driencourt, Michon, Stichtenoth and Xing, see <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17] </ref>, and also by Katsman and Ts-fasman, see [16, p. 387]. <p> The best result so far is that if n &gt; 6g 4, then G defines a self-dual code if and only if there exists a differential form j such that (j) = 2G D and j has simple poles and residue 1 at all the n rational points, see <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> For the main idea we will follow Xing <ref> [17] </ref>. In his work he assumes that G and H have the same degree m and 2g 1 &lt; m &lt; n 1, for the main result he assumes m &lt; n=2 or m &gt; n=2 + 2g 2. 9 His results are based on Clifford's theorem. <p> This is seen in the same way as above. Dually, if G + P i and H + P i are equivalent with respect to D P i and are equivalent with D, then G and H define the same code. This explains why Xing <ref> [17] </ref> assumes 2g 1 &lt; deg (G) &lt; n1. Remark 4.4 The following properties follow immediately from the definitions. Let G and H be two divisors on X . <p> If 2g 2 &lt; m &lt; n and C (D; G) = C (D; H), then l (G) l (G " H) + l (G + H G " H D): Proof We follow Xing <ref> [17] </ref>. For every f 2 L (G) there exists a unique element h f 2 L (H) defining the same codeword, since C (D; G) = C (H; D) and deg (G) = deg (H) &lt; n. <p> The question on self-dual codes was considered before by Driencourt, Michon, Stichtenoth and Xing, see <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17] </ref>. <p> The best result so far is if n &gt; 6g 4, then G defines a self-dual code if and only if there exists a differential form j such that (j) = 2G D and j has residue 1 at all points of D, see <ref> [17, Corollary 4] </ref>. We will show that the assumption n &gt; 2g + 2 instead of n &gt; 6g 4 is sufficient for the characterization to hold. In the next section we generalize an example of [4] which shows that the characterization fails in case n = 2g + 2.
