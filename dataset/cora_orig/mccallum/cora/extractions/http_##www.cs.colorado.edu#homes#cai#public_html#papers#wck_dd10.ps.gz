Reference-contexts: Our main observation is that the efficiency remains very high, almost explicit-like. There is no coarse grid to bottleneck this method. On the other hand the frequent global inner products are minor bottlenecks. We employed the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing (PETSc) <ref> [1] </ref> from Argonne National Laboratory for the numerical studies. 5. Conclusions We have used the standard Galerkin method and to formulate an optimal additive Schwarz method for general scalar linear hyperbolic equations.

Let i ; i = 1; ; N , be nonoverlapping subregions of with quasi-uniform diameters H, such that S i = . The vertices of any i not on @ coincide with the fine-grid mesh vertices. <p> The overlap is generous in the sense that there exists a constant ff &gt; 0 such that dist (@ 0 T 0 T Corresponding to the domain decomposition, we decompose the finite element space V h at each time step k in the customary manner <ref> [2] </ref>, i.e., V h = V h 1 + + V h where V h k is a discrete space whose support is confined to the extended subdomain i . <p> On the other hand, we obtain, kuk 2 kuk 2 which leads to: Lemma 5. The fi-norm is equivalent to the L 2 norm. Therefore, following <ref> [2] </ref>, we come to the conclusion that: ADDITIVE SCHWARZ METHODS FOR HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS 517 Lemma 6.

Reference-contexts: There is, in comparison, relatively little in the domain decomposition literature on hyperbolic problems. Quarteroni [8, 9] used nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods based on the spectral collocation approximation on systems of conservation laws. Gastaldi and Gastaldi <ref> [5, 6] </ref> set up a nonoverlapping domain decomposition scheme based on the finite element approximation for the transport equation. These contributions establish the boundary operators that lead to well-posed decoupled problems, which can then be discretized and solved by standard means. Our interests in this paper are rather different.

Reference-contexts: Many methods possess the attractive property that the convergence rate is optimal, i.e., independent of the size of the discrete problem and of the number of subdomains, or within a polylog factor of optimal. There is, in comparison, relatively little in the domain decomposition literature on hyperbolic problems. Quarteroni <ref> [8, 9] </ref> used nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods based on the spectral collocation approximation on systems of conservation laws. Gastaldi and Gastaldi [5, 6] set up a nonoverlapping domain decomposition scheme based on the finite element approximation for the transport equation.

Reference-contexts: The operator T is inconvenient to obtain explicitly, but the action of T on a function in V h is straightforward to compute, consisting of independent problems in subdomains.
