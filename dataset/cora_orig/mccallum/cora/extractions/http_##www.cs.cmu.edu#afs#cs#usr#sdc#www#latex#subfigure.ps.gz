Abstract: This article documents the L A T E X package `subfigure', which provides support for the inclusion of small, `sub', figures and tables. It simplifies the positioning, captioning and labeling of such objects within a single figure or table environment. In addition, this package allows such sub-captions to be written to a List-of-Figures or List-of-Tables if desired. The `subfigure' package also cooperates with the `caption' package by H.A. Sommerfeldt [1] and should be compatible with all other packages that modify or extend the float environment.

Reference-contexts: If you want to define references using "label, then you need to redefine the L A T E X internal "@currentlabel. For example: "makeatletter "edef"@currentlabel-"p@subfigure"thesubfigure "makeatother 4.5.3 The caption package The only package that interacts with the subfigure package is the caption package by by H.A. Sommerfeldt <ref> [1] </ref>. If you load the subfigure package before the caption package, then it will detect that fact and will change the "subcapsize when the options scriptsize, : : : , large are specified (overriding such options used when loading the subfigure package). <p> Som-merfeldt <ref> [1] </ref>. There are five different sub-caption options supported: normal, hang (or isu), center, centerlast (or anne) and nooneline. The hang sub-caption may be combined with the center or centerlast options.
