Title: Coalition Formation among Bounded Rational Agents  
Author: Tuomas W. Sandholm and Victor R. Lesser

Abstract: This paper analyzes coalition formation among self-interested agents that need to solve combinatorial optimization problems to operate efficiently in the world. By colluding (coordinat-ing their actions by solving a joint optimization problem), the agents can sometimes save costs compared to operating individually. A model of bounded rationality is adopted, where computation resources are costly. It is not worth solving the problems optimally: solution quality is decision-theoretically traded off against computation cost. A normative theory of coalitions among bounded rational (BR) agents is devised. The optimal coalition structure and its stability are significantly affected by the agents' algorithms' performance profiles (PPs) and the cost of computation. This relationship is first analyzed theoretically. A domain classification including rational and BR agents is introduced. Experimental results are presented in the distributed vehicle routing domain using real data from 5 dispatch centers; the optimal coalition structure for BR agents differs significantly from the one for rational agents. These problems are NP-complete and the instances are so large that, with current technology, any agent's rationality is bounded by computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: If the problem is hard and the instance is large, it is unrealistic to assume that it can be solved without deliberation costs. This paper adopts a model of bounded rationality <ref> [ Simon, 1982; Good, 1971 ] </ref> , where each agent has to pay for the computational resources (CPU cycles) that it uses for deliberation.

Reference-contexts: We do not assume that one agent can take care of all the agents' tasks. Unlike our work, they also assume that all agents have the same capabilities. With exponential computation they guarantee each agent an expected value that equals its Shapley value <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984; Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . In a subset of STODs, "Concave Task Oriented Domains" (Fig. 2), the computational complexity is reduced to linear (in agents) using an encryption scheme.

Reference-contexts: In a subset of STODs, "Concave Task Oriented Domains" (Fig. 2), the computational complexity is reduced to linear (in agents) using an encryption scheme. Yet at least one (intractable) combinatorial problem involving all tasks of all agents needs to be solved optimally. <ref> [ Ketchpel, 1994 ] </ref> presents a coalition formation method for rational agents which have different expectations of coalition values. The (computational) origin of these expectations is not addressed. His assumption of imperfect information differs from our setting, where the agents have perfect information, but cannot perfectly deduce.

Reference-contexts: One example is completing an iterative refinement algorithm by running an exhaustive complete algorithm after the refinement phase. Another example is switching from using one refinement operator (e.g. 2-swap in TSP <ref> [ Lin and Kernighan, 1971; Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> ) to using another refinement operator (e.g. 3-swap in TSP). Furthermore, refinements often decrease solution cost in a step-wise manner rendering the PPs locally nonconvex|as in our experiments (Fig. 1 left) 7 .

Reference-contexts: Thus, the problem is NP-complete. Moreover, the problem instances in our example are so large that even the smallest ones are too hard to solve optimally. Therefore, rational coalition formation algorithms for the vehicle routing problem <ref> [ Lundgren et al., 1992 ] </ref> are unusable. Our problem is outside the domain classification of [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] , Fig. 2, because agents do not have symmetric capabilities due to heterogeneous fleets.

Reference-contexts: In practice it is often necessary to learn the other agents' characteristics from previous encounters. Alternatively, the agents can be made to explicitly declare their tasks and resources, but they may lie in order to gain monetarily. <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> analyze when rational agents are motivated to declare truthfully. Unfortunately that work assumes only two agents and that they can optimally solve exponentially many NP-complete problems without computation costs. Even under these assumptions, in most cases, truth-telling is not achieved. <p> Moreover, the problem instances in our example are so large that even the smallest ones are too hard to solve optimally. Therefore, rational coalition formation algorithms for the vehicle routing problem [ Lundgren et al., 1992 ] are unusable. Our problem is outside the domain classification of <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> , Fig. 2, because agents do not have symmetric capabilities due to heterogeneous fleets. If we extend their definition to allow asymmetric capabilities, our domain is in SOD n TOD.

Reference-contexts: features of this price is common to all agents, which corresponds to an open CPU cycle market. 3 If the PPs are only probabilistically known, anytime algorithms may be desirable due to their flexibility with respect to the problem instance, and computing the mapping from the instance to the PP <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994 ] </ref> may take considerable time, thus making the meta-level itself costly. In the limit, the base algorithm would be run at the meta-level to determine what it would achieve for a given time setting. <p> In general, for optimal meta-reasoning, the remaining part of a probabilistic PP should be conditioned on the algorithm's performance on that problem instance on previous CPU time steps <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994; Zilberstein, 1993 ] </ref> . Such conditioning, anytime algorithms, and their integration to coalition formation are part of our current research and are too long to be presented here [ Sand-holm and Lesser, 1995 ] . coalition as will be presented later.

Reference-contexts: cost for coalition S after allocating a certain amount r S of computation plus the domain cost to another coalition T after allocating a certain amount r T of computation is never less than the 5 Definitions 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 are from game theory. 6 Proofs are presented in <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1995 ] </ref> . domain cost of these coalitions combined after allocating r S + r T . <p> In non-BRCFGs, BR superadditivity, BR sub-additivity, and the BRC are undefined, Fig. 2. Instead, the Nash equilibrium may be a reasonable solution concept|although only individual agents are motivated to pertain to it: coalitions may prefer to deviate. These issues are discussed in <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1995 ] </ref> . 6 Related DAI research on collusion Coalition formation has been widely studied in game theory [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984; van der Linden and Verbeek, 1985; Raiffa, 1982 ] ; only the most relevant concepts were presented here. <p> The models are equivalent if the domain cost increases linearly with real time and distribution does not speed up computation. Extensions include generalizing these methods to agents with different PPs, probabilistic PPs, and anytime algorithms where PPs are conditioned on execution so far <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1995; 1994; Zilber-stein, 1993 ] </ref> . Agents with probabilistic PPs may want to reselect a coalition if the value of their original coalition is lower than expected|but sunk computation cost has already been incurred. Future research also includes agents that can refine solutions generated by others.

He approaches the coalition formation and the payoff division problems simultaneously. This is closely related to the contracting protocol of Sandholm <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> (TRACONET), where agents construct the global solution by contracting a small number of tasks at a time, and payments are made regarding each contract before new contracts take place. An agent updates its approximate solution after each task transfer.
