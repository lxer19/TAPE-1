Abstract: We have created an efficient prototype implementation of the Real-Time Producer/Consumer Paradigm, allowing us to build multiprograms within a Unix 1 process. We present a brief introduction to the RTP/C paradigm and the design of a kernel that supports a concurrent programming system based on the RTP/C paradigm. We then discuss the results of adapting an interactive graphics program to use the RTP/C programming model. 2 The Real-Time Producer/Consumer Paradigm (RTP/C) is a paradigm for the design and analysis of real-time systems [Jeffay 89]. Associated with the RTP/C paradigm is a programming model, Communicating Real-Time Processes (CRTP). This paper describes a prototype implementation of an operating system kernel to support systems constructed using the RTP/C paradigm and CRTP, and some experience using this kernel with an interactive graphics application. We will assert that the RTP/C paradigm is helpful in working with real programs and provides real benefits compared to traditional approaches. For example, we can determine bounds on response time for a thread of execution on the critical path through the program. We explain how we adapted a program to use the RTP/C paradigm and CRTP, and the insights we gained as a result.
