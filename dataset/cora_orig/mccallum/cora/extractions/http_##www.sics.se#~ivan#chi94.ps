Abstract: V is a two-dimensional, visual, direct manipulation query language designed for use in a multimodal environment that includes a natural language processing component. The language has the expressiveness of at least full first order predicate logic, including some higher-order extensions that provide a framework within the language itself for navigating and browsing the query domain. The language focuses on the visualisation of the logic structure of queries and is intended as a complement to natural language, providing reification and persistence of discourse objects, together with support for bidirectional paraphrasing and user controlled discourse management. This summary briey describes V, the draft version of a visual, direct manipulation language designed as an alternate modality to natural language in multimodal (query) interfaces (a more complete description can be found in [6]). A proof of concept prototype illustrating some key concepts of the language, and intended for use together with the NL interface CLE [1], has been implemented. The main emphasis of the language, as regards visuality, is on the visualisa-tion of the logical structure of statements/queries, rather than on the visualisation of the domain objects. The expressive power of V is at least equal to that of full first-order predicate logic, containing relations, universal (for all) and existential (there is at least one) quantification, negation, conjunction (and), and disjunction (or). In addition, V supports reference to entities through description (subqueries or composite entities) and provides a The syntax of V is based on that of the Entity-Relationship model [2], and is to a large extent inuenced by the languages of Bretan [4] and of Whang et al.[5]. The primary syntactic elements of the language are boxes, representing conceptual entities, and named arcs connecting them, representing the relations between the entities. In addition, the boxes contain pictorial representations of their entities. For an example of a V query, see figure 1. Queries can be read from any direction, provided that it is from the outside in. Directed relations (those with arrows), however, are read in the direction of their arrows; the first of the entities participating in such a relations usually corresponds to the subject of an NL clause, the second similarly corresponds to the object, and the relation to the main verb.
