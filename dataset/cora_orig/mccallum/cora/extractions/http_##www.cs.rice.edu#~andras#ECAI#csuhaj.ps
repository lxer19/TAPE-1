Title: COLONIES: a Multi-Agent Approach to Language Generation  
Author: Erzsebet Csuhaj-Varju

Abstract: We discuss colonies, a variant of grammar systems, which are a generative framework introduced for modeling multi-agent systems motivated by subsumption architectures. We demonstrate that cooperating systems of very simple grammars are convenient tools for generating complicated languages and describing powerful language classes.

Reference-contexts: Context conditions can be defined on the base of some qualitative property of the string (subword occurrence) or on some quantitative property (the number of symbols, etc.) To demonstrate the increased power of grammars with context conditions, we recall a statement from <ref> [2] </ref>, by means of that every context-sensitive language can be generated by a grammar which has context-free core productions associated with an identical finite set of strings as global forbidding context conditions. (The context-free production can be applied if the sentential form does not have any of the associated strings as

Reference-contexts: Colonies have been studied in detail: starting from the team behavior of the agents to the behavioral stability of the system several properties have been investigated ([12], [16], [9], [17], <ref> [8] </ref>).

Both cases lead to enhancement of the generative power. An interesting variant of colonies with team organization is the symbiotic colony, introduced in <ref> [8] </ref>, motivated by multi-agent systems exhibiting life-like behavior. In this case the team members have to act simultaneously on adjacent letters of the sentential form. Moreover, there are no teams with a common member. Thus, components in the same team highly determine the activity of each other.

Components with context conditions Components of the basic generative model of colony are functioning on the base of a poor ability of recognition, namely, they are able to start with the derivation if they identify an occurrence of their startsymbol in the sentential form.
