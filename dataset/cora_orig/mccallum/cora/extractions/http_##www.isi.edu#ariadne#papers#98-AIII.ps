Abstract: Information mediators are systems capable of providing a unified view of several information sources. Central to any mediator that accesses Web-based sources is a set of wrappers that can extract relevant information from Web pages. In this paper, we present a wrapper-induction algorithm that generates extraction rules for Web-based information sources. We introduce landmark automata, a formalism that describes classes of extraction rules. Our wrapper induction algorithm, stalker, generates extraction rules that are expressed as simple landmark grammars, which are a class of landmark automata that is more expressive than the existing extraction languages. Based on just a few training examples stalker learns extraction rules for documents with multiple levels of embedding. The experimental results show that our approach successfully wraps classes of documents that can not be wrapped by existing techniques.

Reference-contexts: While Kushmerick's approach dramatically reduces the time required to wrap a source, his extraction language is significantly less expressive than the ones provided by the manual approaches. Finally, Ashish and Knoblock ( <ref> (Ashish & Knoblock 1997) </ref>) made a compromise between the manual and the inductive approaches by introducing an expert system that uses a fixed set of heuristics of the type "look for bold or italicized strings".

Reference-contexts: The mediators cited above rely on wrappers that are customized to extract information from semi-structured Web pages (a page is semi-structured if the desired information can be located using a concise, formal grammar). Some mediators, such as tsim-mis (Chawathe et al. 1994) and araneus <ref> (Atzeni, Mecca, & Merialdo 1997) </ref> depend on humans to create the grammar rules required to extract information from a page.
