Abstract: The TMS320C80 is a programmable, parallel processing DSP. The test approach was an engineering mix of design for testability, test view creation, and verification. This mixture facilitated timely test generation and had other important benefits. We document the overall test methodology and the benefits derived therein.

MPSD allows modular access to designs with many scan domains. It also permits a divide and conquer approach to test generation.

Reference-contexts: Design for Test The standard design for test rules to which the MVP conforms are the normal full scan rules associated with a dual phase (master/slave) Level Sensitive Scan Design (LSSD) <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]. These rules state that all memory elements should be part of a scan chain or shadows thereof, only combinational Boolean logic should be permitted outside the scan chains, inputs and outputs should be controllable and observable, respectively, etc.

Reference-contexts: Verification Verification permeated the entire test effort and was based on the premise of performing as much verification as possible, as automatically as possible, and as early as possible in the test process. As part of the design process, an internally developed automatic rule driven checking program <ref> [8] </ref> is employed. This rule checker is used to statically check a number of different design errors that might be made as part of the schematic capture process, such as overload conditions, missing or extra connections, etc.

Reference-contexts: In the case of the MVP it is comprised of Booleanization of the design library and post-processing of the resulting Boolean design netlist. There exist automated methods of performing Booleaniza-tion, such as that of Jain and Bryant <ref> [9] </ref>. However, our library Booleanization was straightforward and was therefore done manually. Most library elements had a Boolean behavior, with the exception of tristate bus drivers and CMOS transistor multiplexors. The former were left as tristate devices and the latter were Booleanized as AND/OR trees.

Reference-contexts: Additionally two of the global buses that entered the PP were complex transceiver loops. These contained a significant amount of logic much of which was not testable without loop cutting. The consistently dominant fault model <ref> [10] </ref> provides added capability for the detection of faults which cause bus contentions. The ANDOR dominance feature available in FastScan uses this model.

Reference-contexts: Several commercial ATPG tools support or plan to support a diagnostic fault simulation capability, and electronics designers and manufacturers have reported success employing automated means for diagnosis, even based on the simple single stuck-at fault model <ref> [16] </ref>, [18]-[20]. FastScan supports diagnostic fault simulation. Furthermore, the implementation of MPSD in MVP supports an emulation capability.

Reference-contexts: Additional software was written to integrate the emulation system with FastScan, and the complete system has been setup for use in the device analysis lab. Again, the diagnostic fault simulation is based on the simple stuck-at fault model <ref> [21] </ref>, and actual physical defects often do not exhibit such ideal behavior. Nevertheless, the system has correctly diagnosed failed MVP silicon. The following example is from an MVP unit which failed scan testing.
