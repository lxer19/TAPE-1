Abstract: We present the design of and performance results for an image database system for remotely sensed imagery. The system stores and serves level 1B remotely sensed data, providing users with a flexible and efficient means for specifying and obtaining image-like products on either a global or a local scale. We have developed both parallel and sequential versions of the system; the parallel version uses the CHAOS++ library, developed at the University of Maryland as part of an NSF Grand Challenge project, to support parallel object oriented programming.

Reference-contexts: our indexing scheme we ran test suites to examine: General Performance Given a query, how long does it take to get an answer? How much work is done by the system to achieve that answer? Scaleability How does the system perform given different numbers of processors and different queries. 12 <ref> [CSS95] </ref> Partitioning Schemes What is the best way to divide a query among processors to achieve a balanced workload? I/O Performance The sheer size of remotely sensed data sets suggests an I/O bound problem.
