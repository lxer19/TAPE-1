Reference-contexts: It might be objected that the structure of the matrix (3.1) is rather special: it is a perturbation of the identity matrix. However, such are the matrices that approximate the slow transient of a nearly completely decomposable Markov chain 8 Sluggish Markov Chains <ref> [1] </ref>. Otherwise, the matrix itself gives no hint of its sluggish transient. The value = 0:01 used in the example is decidedly subcritical. In fact, for = 0:012 (still subcritical) our algorithm was unable to generate a legitimate transition matrix, even after five thousand repetitions.
