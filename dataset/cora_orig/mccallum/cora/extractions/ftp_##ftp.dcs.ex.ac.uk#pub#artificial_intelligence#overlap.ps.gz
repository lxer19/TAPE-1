Reference-contexts: An example of this is shown in Figure 21. Here a one-hole region is continuously transformed first into a simple region, then into a two-piece region (cf. <ref> (Casati and Varzi 1994, Chapter 6) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: There exist a number of theories for handling the qualitative relationships amongst such regions, of which two of the best-known are the Regional Connection Calculus of Cohn et al. (Randell, Cui and Cohn 1992) and the 4-intersection and 9-intersection systems of Egenhofer <ref> (Egenhofer 1989, Egenhofer 1991, Egenhofer and Franzosa 1991) </ref>. In Cohn's RCC-8 system, the qualitative relationship between two spatial regions is classified according to the degree of connection exhibited between the regions, e.g., totally disconnected, connected only at boundary points, and so on.

Reference-contexts: But the calculus does not lend itself readily to the systematic description of relations of this kind, and similar remarks apply to Egenhofer's 4-intersection and 9-intersection systems. 1 (a) (b) On the other hand, the recently-developed system of <ref> (Egenhofer and Franzosa 1995) </ref> can readily characterise the difference between the two figures in Figure 1: the figure in (a) can be denoted h0 (0; CrossingInto; Unbounded); 1 (0; CrossingOutOf; Unbounded)i; whereas the one in (b) is represented by the longer expression h0 (0; CrossingOutOf; Unbounded); 3 (0; CrossingInto; Unbounded); 2 <p> Overlap matrices enable us to describe qualitative spatial configurations at a level of detail hard to emulate in the spatial relation systems of Egenhofer and Cohn et al., without going so far as to embrace the complexities of the topologically complete system of <ref> (Egenhofer and Franzosa 1995) </ref>. We have attended closely to the abstract overlap space determined by the modes of overlap together with the natural neighbourhood relation, here called perturbation. This enables us to specify the ways in which the mode of overlap can change through time.

Reference-contexts: But at that moment, the remaining component becomes two. Thus throughout the change, the overlap matrix is 2 1 : 5 Perturbation Following <ref> (Galton 1993) </ref>, we call a qualitative state S 0 a perturbation of qualitative state S so long as at least one of the following situations is possible: 1. S 0 holds at an instant that limits an interval over which S holds. 2.

Reference-contexts: Thus we have the rule that instantaneous 21 tenure is only possible for a given isotope in the context of a transition sequence in which it dominates both its immediate neighbours. (cf. <ref> (Galton 1994a) </ref>). We have to express this in terms of isotopes rather than overlap matrices since the tangency number plays a part in determining dominance (in the terminology of (Galton 1994b), the overlap matrices do not constitute a dominance space, but the isotopes do).

Reference-contexts: We have to express this in terms of isotopes rather than overlap matrices since the tangency number plays a part in determining dominance (in the terminology of <ref> (Galton 1994b) </ref>, the overlap matrices do not constitute a dominance space, but the isotopes do). This results in a curious possibility, namely that we can have two overlap modes such that each may hold instantaneous tenure in the context of a deviation from the other.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of the perturbation relationship can thus provide an important tool in predicting future changes or reconstructing past ones. A diagram showing perturbations is an envisionment in the sense of de Kleer (see for example (de Kleer and Brown 1984)). Singularities are akin to the attainment of landmark values <ref> (Kuipers 1986) </ref>. Here we shall be concerned with the perturbation structure of overlap space, as specified by the set of possible overlap matrices. The smallest possible change to an overlap matrix is when just one entry increases or decreases by 1. The matrices correspond to nearest neighbours in overlap space.

Reference-contexts: In the latter area particularly, the spatial entities of interest are two-dimensional regions representing portions of the earth's surface. There exist a number of theories for handling the qualitative relationships amongst such regions, of which two of the best-known are the Regional Connection Calculus of Cohn et al. <ref> (Randell, Cui and Cohn 1992) </ref> and the 4-intersection and 9-intersection systems of Egenhofer (Egenhofer 1989, Egenhofer 1991, Egenhofer and Franzosa 1991).

Reference-contexts: Thus we have the principle that whenever a tangency is gained or lost, the tangency itself is present at the instant of transition. We shall call this the tangency principle. It is related to the `continuity rule' of <ref> (Williams 1990) </ref>, with tangency taking the place of value zero. Using this principle, we can see that in a double singularity of type I we must have L = M , while for a double singularity of type II we must have K = L.
