Abstract: The function of an unknown biological sequence can often be accurately inferred by identifying sequences homologous to the original sequence. Given a query set of known homologs, there exist at least three general classes of techniques for finding additional homologs: pairwise sequence comparisons, motif analysis, and hidden Markov modeling. Pairwise sequence comparisons are typically employed when only a single query sequence is known. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), on the other hand, are usually trained with sets of more than 100 sequences. Motif-based methods fall in between these two extremes.

Reference-contexts: Sequence weighting schemes attempt to compensate for this bias by assigning weights to individual sequences, usually based upon the level of sequence similarity. Such schemes may significantly improve the performance of homology detection algorithms <ref> [1, 38, 42] </ref>; however, Henikoff and Henikoff [22] have shown that many weighting schemes perform almost as well as one another. Accordingly, all the experiments reported here employ a simple, binary weighting scheme based upon BLAST similarity scores [30].

Reference-contexts: The most widely used means of inferring homology involves performing pairwise comparisons between a single query sequence and a sequence in a protein database. Dynamic programming algorithms, such as the Needleman-Wunsch [29] and Smith-Waterman algorithms [40], or related heuristic algorithms, such as BLAST <ref> [2, 3] </ref> and FASTA [34], can be used to assign to each sequence in the database a score indicating the likelihood that this sequence is homologous to the query sequence. Because homology inferences are based upon statistical measures, they become increasingly uncertain when the evidence for homology is weak. <p> In addition, for each family a single, independent test set is constructed, consisting of all family members not contained in the query sets. Pairwise sequence comparison For homology detection using Family Pairwise Search, gapped BLAST version 2.0 is used <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. BLAST is a heuristic approximation of a dynamic programming optimization of maximal segment pair scores. The program is run with its default parameters, including the filtering of low-complexity regions and the use of the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix.

An algorithm that uses a representative set of sequences from the family, however, can uncover these missed relationships because homology is transitive <ref> [36, 3] </ref>. The simplest means of detecting homologs using a set of related query proteins is to perform multiple pairwise comparisons. <p> In addition, for each family a single, independent test set is constructed, consisting of all family members not contained in the query sets.

BLAST is a heuristic approximation of a dynamic programming optimization of maximal segment pair scores. The program is run with its default parameters, including the filtering of low-complexity regions and the use of the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix. <p> Iterating this bootstrap procedure should provide even better homology information than the single pass reported here. Iterative applications of BLAST have been suggested [25, 41] and implemented in PSI-BLAST <ref> [3] </ref>. However, PSI-BLAST searches the database using position-specific scoring matrix representations. In order to test the usefulness of this representation, it would be interesting to compare the performance of PSI-BLAST with that of an iterative search that employs Family Pairwise Search.

Reference-contexts: The twilight zone of sequence similarity sets the boundary of confidence levels for detecting evolutionary relatedness of proteins [15]. For most pairwise alignment programs, the twilight zone falls between 20-25% sequence identity <ref> [14] </ref>. In order to push back the twilight zone and thereby discover more remote homologs, additional information is needed. Family-based methods of homology detection leverage the information contained in a set of proteins that are known to be homologous.

The ROC score is the area under a curve that plots true positives versus true negatives for varying score thresholds. ROC analysis combines measures of a search's sensitivity and selectivity. The ROC 50 score is the area under the ROC curve, up to the first 50 false positives.

Reference-contexts: In such an approach, BLAST would be used initially to search for close homologs, which would then be given to a family-based homology detection algorithm.

Iterative applications of BLAST have been suggested <ref> [25, 41] </ref> and implemented in PSI-BLAST [3]. However, PSI-BLAST searches the database using position-specific scoring matrix representations. In order to test the usefulness of this representation, it would be interesting to compare the performance of PSI-BLAST with that of an iterative search that employs Family Pairwise Search.

Reference-contexts: The most widely used means of inferring homology involves performing pairwise comparisons between a single query sequence and a sequence in a protein database. Dynamic programming algorithms, such as the Needleman-Wunsch <ref> [29] </ref> and Smith-Waterman algorithms [40], or related heuristic algorithms, such as BLAST [2, 3] and FASTA [34], can be used to assign to each sequence in the database a score indicating the likelihood that this sequence is homologous to the query sequence.

Accordingly, all the experiments reported here employ a simple, binary weighting scheme based upon BLAST similarity scores <ref> [30] </ref>. This approach is simple, since the highly similar sequences can be removed at once before any analysis is performed, and leads to faster training, since the sizes of the weighted training sets are reduced. For these experiments, a BLAST similarity threshold of 200 is used.

Reference-contexts: This approach may be augmented by adding the newly discovered homologs to the query set and iterating until a transitive closure of the homology relationship is computed <ref> [41, 31] </ref>.

For example, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used extensively to model protein families [26, 10, 16].

Reference-contexts: The method thereby allows for the detection of remote homologs that lack significant similarity with one or more of the training set sequences. FPS is therefore similar to the intermediate sequence approach suggested by Pearson [37] and Park et al. <ref> [33] </ref>. Also, FPS may perform well relative to motif-based methods because BLAST allows for query-to-target matches along the entire length of the sequences, rather than only within the motif regions. These non-motif regions often contain important evidence of homology [37].

Reference-contexts: The most widely used means of inferring homology involves performing pairwise comparisons between a single query sequence and a sequence in a protein database. Dynamic programming algorithms, such as the Needleman-Wunsch [29] and Smith-Waterman algorithms [40], or related heuristic algorithms, such as BLAST [2, 3] and FASTA <ref> [34] </ref>, can be used to assign to each sequence in the database a score indicating the likelihood that this sequence is homologous to the query sequence. Because homology inferences are based upon statistical measures, they become increasingly uncertain when the evidence for homology is weak.

Reference-contexts: ROC 50 scores are normalized to range from 0 to 1, with 1.0 corresponding to the most sensitive and selective search. In addition to ROC 50 analysis, each homology detection method is evaluated using the equivalence number <ref> [35] </ref>. The equivalence number is the number of false positives given by a database search when the threshold is set so that the number of false positives equals the number of false negatives.

Reference-contexts: In a diverse family of proteins, individual members may have very low pairwise sequence similarity and hence might be missed by a pairwise analysis. An algorithm that uses a representative set of sequences from the family, however, can uncover these missed relationships because homology is transitive <ref> [36, 3] </ref>. The simplest means of detecting homologs using a set of related query proteins is to perform multiple pairwise comparisons.

Reference-contexts: First, the FPS score incorporates information from multiple sequence comparisons into a single score. The method thereby allows for the detection of remote homologs that lack significant similarity with one or more of the training set sequences. FPS is therefore similar to the intermediate sequence approach suggested by Pearson <ref> [37] </ref> and Park et al. [33]. Also, FPS may perform well relative to motif-based methods because BLAST allows for query-to-target matches along the entire length of the sequences, rather than only within the motif regions.

Also, FPS may perform well relative to motif-based methods because BLAST allows for query-to-target matches along the entire length of the sequences, rather than only within the motif regions. These non-motif regions often contain important evidence of homology [37]. On the other hand, FPS avoids building models of the relatively noisy, inter-motif regions in the query set. The difficulty of properly aligning these regions, especially when the number of query sequences is small, most likely accounts for the relatively poor performance of the hidden Markov model method.

Reference-contexts: Sequence weighting schemes attempt to compensate for this bias by assigning weights to individual sequences, usually based upon the level of sequence similarity.

Accordingly, all the experiments reported here employ a simple, binary weighting scheme based upon BLAST similarity scores [30].

Reference-contexts: A typical, 200-state HMM may contain on the order of 5000 trainable parameters. Adequate training of such a model can require on the order of 200 homologous sequences [13]. The use of empirically derived Dirichlet mixture priors <ref> [13, 39] </ref> can partially offset the need for larger training sets. The size of the model may be greatly reduced by focusing only upon regions that are highly conserved across family members. Usually these regions, called motifs, have been conserved by evolution for important structural or functional reasons.

Reference-contexts: This approach may be augmented by adding the newly discovered homologs to the query set and iterating until a transitive closure of the homology relationship is computed <ref> [41, 31] </ref>. More sophisticated homology detection methods involve two steps: first building a statistical model of the family and then comparing that model to each sequence in the database. For example, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used extensively to model protein families [26, 10, 16]. <p> If, in fact, covariation between sites imposes a significant evolutionary constraint, then searching separately with each training set sequence will respect that constraint. The results reported here appear to be in conflict with those of Tatusov et al. <ref> [41] </ref>. They compare four homology detection techniques based upon position-specific scoring matrices with a control method in which candidate sequences are scored according to their maximum match with any sequence in a set of known homologs. This control method is thus very similar to FPS. <p> In such an approach, BLAST would be used initially to search for close homologs, which would then be given to a family-based homology detection algorithm. Iterating this bootstrap procedure should provide even better homology information than the single pass reported here. Iterative applications of BLAST have been suggested <ref> [25, 41] </ref> and implemented in PSI-BLAST [3]. However, PSI-BLAST searches the database using position-specific scoring matrix representations. In order to test the usefulness of this representation, it would be interesting to compare the performance of PSI-BLAST with that of an iterative search that employs Family Pairwise Search.
