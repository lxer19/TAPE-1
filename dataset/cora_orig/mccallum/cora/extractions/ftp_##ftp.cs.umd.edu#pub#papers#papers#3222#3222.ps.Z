Abstract: We present an approach to function-based object recognition that reasons about the functionality of an object's intuitive parts. We extend the popular "recognition by parts" shape recognition framework to support "recognition by functional parts", by combining a set of functional primitives and their relations with a set of abstract volumetric shape primitives and their relations. Previous approaches have relied on more global object features, often ignoring the problem of object segmentation and thereby restricting themselves to range images of unoccluded scenes. We show how these shape primitives and relations can be easily recovered from superquadric ellipsoids which, in turn, can be recovered from either range or intensity images of occluded scenes. Furthermore, the proposed framework supports both unexpected (bottom-up) object recognition and expected (top-down) object recognition. We demonstrate the approach on a simple domain by recognizing The support of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, under Grant F49620-93-1-0039, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA Order No. 8459) and the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center under Contract DACA76-92-C-0009 is gratefully acknowledged, as is the help of Sandy German in preparing this paper. a restricted class of hand-tools from 2-D images.

Reference-contexts: Based on the shapes we want to recover (sticks, strips, plates, and blobs with possible tapering and bending global deformations), we first consider the case of superquadric ellipsoids <ref> [1] </ref>, which are given by the following formula: e = a B B @ * 1 C v a 2 C u * 2 * 1 C C A where =2 u =2 and v &lt; , and where S w * = sgn (sin w)j sin wj * , and

Reference-contexts: For example, we can attach two shapes end-to-end, end-to-side, or side-to-side, as proposed by Biederman when building objects out of geons <ref> [2] </ref>. To further specify these attachments, we adopt the convention of labeling each volumetric primitive's attachment surfaces [7]. For example, a square plate has six attachment surfaces, while a cylindrical stick has three attachment surfaces. <p> For example, we may decide to distinguish among curved-axis vs. straight-axis shapes or tapering vs. constant cross-sectional sweep rules <ref> [2] </ref>. 8 Recently, several researchers have proposed segmentation techniques for partitioning image or range data, in order to automate the process of fitting superquadric volumetric primitives to data.

Reference-contexts: How can we avoid having to provide the system with detailed CAD specifications of each object that the system is to recognize? One way of making object models more flexible is to parameterize geometric models, as proposed by Brooks in his ACRONYM system <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, the legs of a chair model could have lengths that fall in some specified range, or the number of chair legs could be variable. Object recognition systems using parameterized models have also been proposed by Huttenlocher [12] and by Lowe [15].

Reference-contexts: In this section, we will describe both of these strategies. 4.1 Unexpected Object Recognition In an unexpected object recognition task, we first first segment an input image into a set of homogeneous regions from which we recover a set of qualitative 3-D parts using local part-based aspect matching techniques <ref> [4, 6, 7] </ref>. Next, using the techniques of Dickinson and Metaxas [5, 17], we use the recovered qualitative shape to constrain the fitting of a set of deformable superquadrics to the qualitative parts.

Reference-contexts: In a related approach, Narayan and Jain [22] recover geons from range imagery, and use superquad fitting to determine the axis of the geon. The approach we take, due to Dickinson and Metaxas <ref> [5, 17] </ref>, is to use a qualitative segmentation of the image to provide strong constraints on the deformable model fitting procedure described in [32]. The result is a technique which allows us to recover certain classes of superquadrics from image data, under orthographic, perspective, and stereo projection [17]. <p> Furthermore, the technique supports the recovery of occluded parts, allowing us, unlike the work of Stark and Bowyer, to reason about the functionality of objects that are only partially visible. We will not describe the above recovery methods in this paper; details can be found in <ref> [5, 17] </ref>. <p> Next, using the techniques of Dickinson and Metaxas <ref> [5, 17] </ref>, we use the recovered qualitative shape to constrain the fitting of a set of deformable superquadrics to the qualitative parts. From the resulting quantitative parts, we compare the dimensions of the parts to abstract a set of sticks, strips, plates, and blobs.

Reference-contexts: Recognition is equivalent to the process that checks if an object suits a particular purpose. If an object is perceived to fulfill a function necessary to carry out a certain behavior or action, then it is recognized. Gibson's theory of affordances <ref> [10] </ref>, i.e., properties that are defined with reference to an observer, was a major step in this direction. Winston et al. [35] emphasized how much easier it is to describe what objects are used for, rather 1 than to describe what objects look like.

Object recognition systems using parameterized models have also been proposed by Huttenlocher <ref> [12] </ref> and by Lowe [15].

Reference-contexts: Full recovery has been difficult to achieve while matching suffers from combinatorial explosion. Model-based recognition has been suggested as a remedy to these problems.

The object models are commonly CAD-like, capturing the exact geometry of the object. Although very effective for certain robot vision tasks in constrained environments, where a known target must be accurately localized for manipulation or inspection, these techniques are inadequate when addressing less constrained environments.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of distinguishing properties such as color, texture, or motion, object recognition first requires the visual recovery of shape, followed by the matching of the recovered shape to a database of known objects <ref> [16] </ref>. Although much research on the topic has been published, the community still lacks vision systems that can recognize in real time a large number of objects (natural or man-made). Full recovery has been difficult to achieve while matching suffers from combinatorial explosion.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, those parts are the same parts that we recover from the image for shape recognition. Thus, instead of reasoning about the functionality of a collection of 3-D points or planar surfaces, we propose to reason about a more intuitive notion of an object's parts (Pentland <ref> [19] </ref>). Although we will not index using part shape, we can use knowledge of part shape to help segment the image into parts. Given a set of recovered volumetric parts, we can then reason about both the functionality of the individual parts and the interactions between the parts. <p> Note that our taxonomy of primitives is qualitative; a cylinder, for example, can be a stick or a plate. Variations of the basic primitives, such as tapering, pinch, curvature, and so on, can also be considered in the context of functionality. 4 (a) (b) Thingworld <ref> [19] </ref>. (b) Two blobs (can and vase), two sticks (pencil and pen), and a plate (table). 2.1.2 Spatial Relations We can qualitatively describe the ways in which two shape primitives can be combined. <p> The approach consists of recovering a superquadric from the image, providing explicit dimensions which we can then use to classify our shape. Superquadrics offer a compact, coarse, volumetric description of an object's parts <ref> [19] </ref>. If finer shape modeling is required, deformable superquadrics can be used to capture both global part shape (using a superquadric) and local shape (using a deformable mesh) [32].

Reference-contexts: If an object is perceived to fulfill a function necessary to carry out a certain behavior or action, then it is recognized. Gibson's theory of affordances [10], i.e., properties that are defined with reference to an observer, was a major step in this direction. Winston et al. <ref> [35] </ref> emphasized how much easier it is to describe what objects are used for, rather 1 than to describe what objects look like. They tried to show how recognition could be performed using functional definitions, and how physical models could be learned using functional definitions and specific acts of identification.
