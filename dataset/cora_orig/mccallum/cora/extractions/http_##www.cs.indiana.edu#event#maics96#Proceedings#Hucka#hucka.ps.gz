Abstract: Humans and other natural systems are remarkably adept at extracting spatial information from vision. To better understand this process, it would be useful to know how the visual system can make an initial estimate of where things are in a scene and how they are oriented. Texture is one source of information that the visual system can use for this purpose. It can be used both for segmenting the visual input and for estimating spatial orientations within segmented regions; moreover, each of these two processes can be performed starting with the same mechanisms, namely spatiotemporally-tuned cells in the visual cortex. But little attention has been given to the problem of integrating the two processes into a single system. In this paper, we discuss texture-based visual processing and review recent work in computer vision that offers insights into how a visual system could solve this problem. We then argue that a beneficial extension to these approaches would be to incorporate an initial coarse-scale segmentation step. We offer supporting evidence from psychophysics that the human visual system does in fact perform such a rough segmentation early in vision.

Reference-contexts: A complex cell is not particularly sensitive to the position of a stimulus within its receptive field <ref> (De Valois and De Valois, 1990) </ref>. Its response can be thought of as representing the amount of a particular type of spatial structure, such as texture, within its tuning range and its region of spatial pooling. <p> Instead, a complex cell may be better suited to signaling the presence of regional repetitive variations in luminance and other stimulus dimensions. Such a response would be a useful starting point for texture analysis <ref> (De Valois and De Valois, 1990) </ref>. Segmentation Based on Texture.

Reference-contexts: But how does the visual system extract layout? What kinds of visual information and associated neural information-processing mechanisms are useful for this purpose? Texture is one well-known source of information that the visual system can use <ref> (Gibson, 1950) </ref>. Motion, stereopsis, and other sources of information are powerful cues for spatial perception and important when available.

Reference-contexts: Cortical simple cells have receptive fields divided into distinct excitatory and inhibitory subregions, within which light is summed approximately linearly. These neurons can be modeled as linear spatiotemporal filters combined with additional mechanisms, such as rectification, that produce the final response <ref> (Heeger, 1992) </ref>. Conversely, complex cells do not have distinct subregions within their receptive field; they can be modeled as pooling the outputs of multiple, overlapping, spatiotemporal filters that have properties similar to those of simple cells (Heeger, 1992). <p> spatiotemporal filters combined with additional mechanisms, such as rectification, that produce the final response <ref> (Heeger, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Rather than analyzing textures on the basis of element shapes (Julesz, 1986)something difficult at best for irregular natural texturesit has proven effective to use spatial-frequency content in local neighborhoods (Graham, 1991; Sagi, 1991; Sakai and Finkel, 1995). The Role of Cortical Cells. The simple and complex cells <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959) </ref> of the primary visual cortex of the brain have interesting properties in this regard. Cortical simple cells have receptive fields divided into distinct excitatory and inhibitory subregions, within which light is summed approximately linearly.

Reference-contexts: In other words, without coarse-grained spatial information in the visual input, the global pattern no longer seemed to dominate subjects' perceptions. Hughes et al. therefore suggested that under certain conditions, global spatial structure might be directly encoded by low-frequency mechanisms rather than by hierarchical feature processing <ref> (Hughes et al., 1990) </ref>. Different experiments carried out by Schyns and Oliva (1994) also argue for a predominantly coarse-to-fine process in vision. Schyns and Oliva constructed hybrid images composed of the low spatial-frequency content of one scene superimposed on the high spatial-frequency content of another scene.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, there is evidence strongly suggesting that the visual system does not pay much attention to the shapes of individual texture elements (Todd and Ak-erstrom, 1987; Sakai and Finkel, 1995). Rather than analyzing textures on the basis of element shapes <ref> (Julesz, 1986) </ref>something difficult at best for irregular natural texturesit has proven effective to use spatial-frequency content in local neighborhoods (Graham, 1991; Sagi, 1991; Sakai and Finkel, 1995).

Reference-contexts: This is a problem for most models of texture-based segmentation; they are designed with the assumption that separate regions are each characterized by homogeneous texture. Consequently, they can be mislead by the systematic distortions of texture within regions that characterize slanted or curved surfaces <ref> (Krumm, 1993) </ref>. 2 (a) (b) (c) (b) A slanted surface covered with dots, illustrating gradients of compression, foreshortening, scaling and density.

Reference-contexts: A limitation of most current models is that they are designed with the assumption that the input contains a single surface. This is the case for most psychophysical (e.g., Todd and Akerstrom, 1987), neurobiological (e.g., Sakai and Finkel, 1995), and computational <ref> (e.g., Malik and Rosenholtz, 1994) </ref> approaches. Realistic scenes, however, contain multiple textured regions, and most current models cannot cope with such inputs because they assume that texture inhomogeneities are related only to changes in the shape of a single surface. A few researchers have attempted to address this limitation.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that these findings parallel another set of results: humans can react to low spatial-frequency stimuli more rapidly than high spatial-frequency stimuli <ref> (Parker and Dutch, 1987) </ref>. 5 Summary Global precedence and related phenomena support the view that visual processing in humans usually proceeds in a multiscale, coarse-to-fine manner, with the visual system extracting a coarse de 5 scription of the arrangement of major visible elements before finer details.
