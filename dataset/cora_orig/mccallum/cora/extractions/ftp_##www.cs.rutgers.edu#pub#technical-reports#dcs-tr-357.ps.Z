Abstract: This paper considers the problem of handoff management in an Integrated Services Packet Network supporting mobile hosts. In such a network, links may become overloaded due to a high concentration of mobile hosts within a given cell. As a result, the required Quality of Service guarantees cannot be provided to all flows in that cell. However, there exists adaptive applications which can operate over a wide range of available bandwidth. Thus, it may be possible to overcome the link overload condition by reducing the bandwidth of individual flows, which we call rate adaptation. The two most important properties of a rate adaptation scheme are its network overhead and its fairness property. Rate adaptation schemes which ensure certain fairness properties, such as maxmin optimality criteria, have very high network overhead. Therefore, these schemes are not suitable for a highly mobile environment where rate adaptation may have to be invoked frequently. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between the network overhead and the fairness property of rate adaptation in a mobile environment. We first characterize the fairness property of rate adaptation by several measurable parameters. We then describe two rate adaptation schemes, one of which has very low network overhead but is `unfair', while the other scheme is `fair' but has very high network overhead. Finally we propose a new rate adaptation scheme which reconciles the two conflicting properties. Results of simulation experiments comparing the performances of the three rate adaptation schemes are presented.

Reference-contexts: However many applications are adaptive in nature and they can operate over a wide range of bandwidth. For example, in the wireless communication environment, recently developed hardware for video coding can adaptively deliver digital video at rates between 60K bits/sec and 600K bits/sec <ref> [4] </ref>. Also, to support heterogeneous receivers, use of layered media streams has been suggested for real-time multimedia transmissions [8, 10, 13, 15].

Reference-contexts: Typical applications that require real-time services include audio library, image browsing, video conferencing and video-on-demand. These multimedia applications require a bound, which may be absolute or statistical, on the delivery delay of each packet.

Reference-contexts: In this model, the multimedia data source disseminates multiple levels of quality across multiple network channels and a receiver can adapt its reception rate by adjusting the number of layers it receives. There has been several proposals for layered video compressions and layered transmission systems <ref> [14, 6] </ref>. Therefore, in such a network, it may be possible to overcome the link overload condition by reducing the bandwidth of individual flows, which we call rate adaptation.

Reference-contexts: Many of these research have been done in the context of rate control for Available Bit Rate (ABR) traffic in an ATM network. These works have focused on the efficiency and fairness of the rate allocation scheme. Charny <ref> [7] </ref>, Abraham i.e.[1] and Tsang i.e.[19] have proposed distributed algorithms that ensures max-min fairness. These algorithms can computes fair rates for all flows over the entire network.

These algorithms can computes fair rates for all flows over the entire network. In a mobile environment, Lu et. al.[12] have used the distributed rate allocation algorithm proposed by Charny [7] to reallocate the link bandwidth after handoff by a mobile host and flow termination. In this work a threshold based activation of rate reallocation has been proposed to reduce the overhead of rate reallocation. <p> With this simplifying assumption, we can avoid the complexities of the distributed rate allocation problem. However, if the wired links have limited bandwidth, we can use the rate reallocation schemes discussed in e.g. <ref> [12, 7] </ref> combined with the 4 rate adaptation schemes described later in this paper. We also assume that, the base stations have sufficient computing power and therefore it is more important to reduce network overhead (possibly) at the expense of computations at the base stations. <p> Note that, we do not invoke rate adaptation to admit a new flow in an overloaded cell. In other words, no new flow is admitted in an overloaded cell. 4.2 Mobility, Fairness and Network Overhead In a fixed network, max-min optimality criteria is used for rate allocation <ref> [7] </ref>. The details of this fairness criteria can be found in [7]. A rate allocation satisfying this fairness criteria allocates rates to the flows in the following way. We first consider all bottleneck links, i.e. the link with the smallest bandwidth available per flow. <p> In other words, no new flow is admitted in an overloaded cell. 4.2 Mobility, Fairness and Network Overhead In a fixed network, max-min optimality criteria is used for rate allocation <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In such a network, certain links may become overloaded when a large number of mobile hosts enter into a cell and the bandwidth of the link is not sufficient to provide the required throughput of all flows simultaneously. This problem may also arise in a link sharing environment <ref> [9] </ref>, where multiple agencies, protocol families, or traffic types share the bandwidth of a common link. In such a system, the available bandwidth to a particular service class may vary over time depending on the user load in other service classes.
