Abstract: This paper describes a reservation protocol to provide real-time services to mobile users in an Integrated Services Packet Network. Mobility of hosts has significant impact on the quality of service provided to a real-time application. The currently proposed network system architecture and mechanisms to provide real-time services to fixed hosts are inadequate to accommodate the mobile hosts which can frequently change their point of attachments to the fixed network. Mobile hosts may experience wide variations of quality of service due to mobility. Therefore, a new real-time service architecture is necessary to accommodate mobile hosts which can tolerate variations in QoS and those which want mobility independent service guarantees in the same network. To obtain mobility independent service guarantees, a mobile host needs to make resource reservations at all locations it may visit during the lifetime of the connection. The currently proposed reservation protocol in the Internet, RSVP, is not adequate to make such reservations for mobile hosts. In this paper, we describe a new reservation protocol, MRSVP, for supporting Integrated Services in mobile networks.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we propose a reservation protocol, MRSVP for mobile users in the above architecture. Recently there has been some work addressing the problem of providing QoS to mobile hosts. Acampora and Naghshineh <ref> [1] </ref> have presented an architecture for a high-speed mobile ATM network using a new concept known as the virtual connection tree. Singh [21] has introduced two new QoS parameters, loss profile and probability of seamless communication, arising due to the mobility of the mobile host.

Reference-contexts: This has led to an intensive research in the area of Mobile Computing to provide mobile users access to an inter network. The research, so far, has focussed on the problem of maintaining connectivity at the network and transport layer in spite of the mobility of the mobile hosts <ref> [18, 4, 2, 14] </ref>. Also, there have been several proposals for supporting real-time applications in an Integrated Services Packet Network (ISPN). Typical applications that require real-time services include audio library, image browsing, video conferencing and video-on-demand.

Reference-contexts: As portable computers become more powerful and the accessibility of a fixed network from a mobile host becomes easier, the number of mobile users will grow and additionally the mobile users will demand the same real-time services available to fixed hosts. Applications such as Internet Cellular Phone <ref> [3] </ref>, access to real-time data through the Web (e.g., call center application), require that the network offer quality of service to moving users. Mobility of hosts has a significant impact on the QoS parameters of a real-time application.

Jamin et. al. have proposed an admission control scheme for an ISPN <ref> [13] </ref>. A reservation protocol reserves resources at the routers along the data flow path. Zhang et. al.[27] have described a protocol, RSVP, that sets up resource reservation for real-time traffic in the internet. <p> A flow is admitted to the network only if it passes the admission control criteria at each switch or base station where the flow requires reservation. To improve the utilization of the network bandwidth, Jamin et. al. have proposed a measurement-based admission control scheme for the ISPN <ref> [13] </ref>. In this scheme, instead of using the a priori worst case parameters, measured parameters of currently existing flows are used in the admission control criteria.

Reference-contexts: Therefore a new system architecture is required to handle the effects of mobility. Talukdar et. al. have described a new system architecture which can accommodate mobile hosts in an ISPN <ref> [22] </ref>. In this paper we describe the reservation protocol for mobile hosts in the system architecture described by Talukdar et. al.[22]. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the effects of mobility on the real-time applications and some related works that have addressed the problem.

This shows that, it is viable to provide mobility independent services in a network. 4 Overview of IPv6, IETF Mobile-IP and RSVP MRSVP is an extension of the resource reservation protocol in the internet, RSVP [27], and it closely interacts with the routing protocols.

Reference-contexts: In MRSVP, messages are tunnelled using RSVP encapsulation which allows resource reservation inside a tunnel. We are currently investigating into the issues related to scalability and security in MRSVP. The detailed specification of MRSVP <ref> [24] </ref> will be submitted as an Internet Request For Comments. We are also implementing this protocol and determining its performance overhead.

Reference-contexts: These protocols cannot be used by a mobile host to acquire a care-of address remotely in a foreign subnet where it is not currently present. Hence, a mobile host need to use a mechanism such as Service Location Protocol <ref> [25] </ref> to acquire care-of addresses remotely. The details of this mechanism is out of the scope of this paper. In the following, we describe an alternative protocol for dynamically acquiring foreign agent care-of-address in a foreign subnet where the mobile host is not currently located.

Reference-contexts: The flowspec consists of a service class and two sets of numeric parameters: (1) an Rspec that defines the desired QoS and (2) a Tspec that describes the traffic characteristics of the data flow. The formats and contents of Tspec and Rspec is determined by the integrated services modules <ref> [26] </ref> and are generally opaque to RSVP. The Resv 8 message traverses the reverse path of data flow from the sender to the receiver. If at any switch along this path, the reservation is rejected, the switch sends a ResvErr message to the receiver. <p> The merged flowspec contains the "largest" of the flowspecs requested by the next hops. The "largest" of a set of flowspecs is computed by following merging schemes which depend on the rules of comparing flowspecs <ref> [27, 26] </ref>. In MRSVP, in addition to merging flowspecs requested by the different next-hops at an interface, it must also merge the active and passive reservations for the same session. The flowspec of the 18 merged reservation is the larger of the flowspecs of the active and passive reservations.
