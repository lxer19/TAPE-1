Title: On Maximal Parsings of Strings  
Author: Harald Helfgott and Martin Cohn 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department, Brandeis U.  
Abstract: Given a sequence, we consider the maximum number of distinct phrases in any parsing; this definition of complexity is invariant under string reversal. We show that Lempel-Ziv parsings can vary under reversal by a factor on the order of log of sequence length. We give two interpretations of maximal parsing, show that they are not equivalent and that one lacks a plausible monotonicity property.

Reference-contexts: Indeed Gilbert and Kadota believe that under the latter measure, the complexity of a sequence and of its reversal "...can differ by an arbitrarily large factor if [the number of phrases] is large enough" <ref> [GilbertK'92] </ref> and cite individual examples of disparity. In our discussion below, we give a family of sequences for which the complexities of sequences and their reversals differ by factors on the order of logarithm of sequence length.

Reference-contexts: A binary deBruijn sequence of degree n <ref> [Knuth'81] </ref> is a sequence of length N = 2 n + n 1 in which every binary ntuple occurs exactly once. 4 We use the notation d i to mean d i d i+1 d j if i j or d j d j1 d i if i j.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we consider two measures of complexity defined on finite sequences over finite alphabets. The measures were suggested by a definition in the seminal paper of Lempel and Ziv, "On the Complexity of Finite Sequences." <ref> [LempelZ'76] </ref> The definition, in the proof of Theorem 2, reads "Let N denote the maximum possible number of distinct words into which a sequence of length n over A can be parsed." Reading with Talmudic scruple, one can understand N to count either 1) the number of phrases in a parsing <p> Either interpretation has the appealing property of being invariant under sequence reversal, a property most appropriate to the study of finite combinatorial objects rather than of sources. The complexities defined by extremal parsing <ref> [LempelZ'76] </ref>: "Parse the longest string which can be found also to begin at an earlier point;" or by incremental parsing [ZivL'78]: "Parse the shortest string which has not yet been parsed" are not invariant under sequence reversal. <p> Lemma 9: For every x 2 n D (s) C (x) (1 * n ) log (n) where * n = 2 log (n) Proof: This is a quotation of Theorem 2 of <ref> [LempelZ'76] </ref>. The proof entails bound ing the maximum number of distinct phrases of any size whose sizes sum to n. Lemma 10: As n approaches infinity, almost all sequences x have maximal values of C (x) and D (x). Proof: This follows from Theorem 3 of [LempelZ'76]: almost all sequences have <p> of Theorem 2 of <ref> [LempelZ'76] </ref>. The proof entails bound ing the maximum number of distinct phrases of any size whose sizes sum to n. Lemma 10: As n approaches infinity, almost all sequences x have maximal values of C (x) and D (x). Proof: This follows from Theorem 3 of [LempelZ'76]: almost all sequences have the complexity cited in Lemma 12, while C (x) and D (x) are upper-bounded by that complexity. 4 Conjectures We formulated two major conjectures as a result of the exhaustive parsing of all binary sequences of lengths up to 24.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the exact details depend on the particular sequences chosen; these were formed from initial states 0 n 1 (to ensure the all-0 ntuple) continued by primitive linear recurrences. <ref> [PetersonW'72] </ref>. The length of the parsed sequence in each case is 2 or approximately 2 2n1 .
