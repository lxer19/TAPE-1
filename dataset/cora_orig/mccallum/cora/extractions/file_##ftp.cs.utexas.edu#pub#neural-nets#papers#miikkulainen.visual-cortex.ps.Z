Abstract: Based on a Hebbian adaptation process, the afferent and lateral connections in the RF-LISSOM model organize simultaneously and cooperatively, and form structures such as those observed in the primary visual cortex. The neurons in the model develop local receptive fields that are organized into orientation, ocular dominance, and size selectivity columns. At the same time, patterned lateral connections form between neurons that follow the receptive field organization. This structure is in a continuously-adapting dynamic equilibrium with the external and intrinsic input, and can account for reorganization of the adult cortex following retinal and cortical lesions. The same learning processes may be responsible for a number of low-level functional phenomena such as tilt aftereffects, and combined with the leaky integrator model of the spiking neuron, for segmentation and binding. The model can also be used to verify quantitatively the hypothesis that the visual cortex forms a sparse, redundancy-reduced encoding of the input, which allows it to process massive amounts of visual information efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Although such experiments require even larger cortex and retina sizes, they should become practical in the near future. In addition, many similar phenomena such as aftereffects of curvature, motion, spatial frequency, size, position, and color have been documented in humans <ref> (Barlow 1990) </ref>. Since specific detectors for most of these features have been found, RF-LISSOM is expected to be able to account for them by the same process of decorrelation mediated by self-organizing lateral connections. 22 decayed summation of incoming spikes.

Reference-contexts: Several observations indicate that the lateral connection structure is not defined genetically, but depends on the visual input: (1) When the primary visual cortex (of the cat) is deprived of visual input during early development, lateral connectivity remains crude and unrefined <ref> (Callaway and Katz 1991) </ref>. (2) The pattern of lateral connection clusters can be altered by changing the input to the developing cortex.

Reference-contexts: In the second, after extending the RF-LISSOM architecture with a more realistic spiking model of the neuron, fast adaptation of lateral connections is shown to establish synchronization between neurons representing the same input object, forming a basis for binding and segmentation. 6.1 Tilt Aftereffects The tilt after-effect <ref> (TAE, Gibson and Radner 1937) </ref> is an intriguing visual phenomenon that has long been studied as an indication of the underlying mechanisms of the visual system. After staring at a pattern of tilted lines or gratings, subsequent lines appear to have a slight tilt in the opposite direction.

Reference-contexts: Such a lesion prevents part of the cortex from receiving input, producing a corresponding cortical scotoma. However, if the surround of the scotoma is stimulated for a period of several minutes, and the scotoma is then removed, the receptive fields of the unstimulated neurons are found to have expanded <ref> (Pettet and Gilbert 1992) </ref>. The expansion is largest along the preferred orientation of each neuron. Psychophysical experiments further show that after removing the scotoma, a stimulus at the edge of the scotoma appears to have shifted towards the center (Kapadia et al. 1994). <p> However, if the perturbation persists for long, synaptic weight changes accumulate, and the topographic map reorganizes substantially. Such receptive field dynamics has been recently observed in the visual cortex <ref> (Pettet and Gilbert 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The cortex appears to be a continuously-adapting structure in a dynamic equilibrium with both the external and intrinsic input. This equilibrium is maintained by cooperative and competitive lateral interactions within the cortex, mediated by lateral connections <ref> (Gilbert et al. 1990) </ref>. The afferent and lateral connection patterns develop synergetically and simultaneously, based on the same underlying process. The primary function of the afferent and lateral structures is to form a sparse, redundancy-reduced encoding of the visual input (Barlow 1972; Field 1994). <p> Second, the lateral interactions between such columns are primarily excitatory in the short range and inhibitory in the long range. This assumption is more controversial since about 80% of the long-range connections are known to have excitatory synapses in the cortex <ref> (Gilbert et al.1990) </ref>. However, the connections in RF-LISSOM are intended to model the overall excitation/inhibition between columns, not the individual synapses. The long-range excitatory connections could link to inhibitory cells in simple local circuits, and the overall effect could be inhibitory.

Reference-contexts: The expansion is largest along the preferred orientation of each neuron. Psychophysical experiments further show that after removing the scotoma, a stimulus at the edge of the scotoma appears to have shifted towards the center <ref> (Kapadia et al. 1994) </ref>. Prima facie, such dynamic expansion of receptive fields, and the perceptual shift accompanying it, is incompatible with Hebbian self-organization (which are based on coincident activity), and has been difficult to explain. The RF-LISSOM model suggests an explanation.

Reference-contexts: Above the threshold, symmetry breaking occurs, producing a variety of RF sizes for each location in the retina. Such symmetry breaking is similar to that of the Self-Organizing Map <ref> (Kohonen 1982, 1989, 1995) </ref>, where an input feature is represented in the network only if its variance is greater than a threshold proportional to the magnification factor (Obermayer et al. 1992). <p> If so, what could be the functional role of these self-organized structures in visual processing? The information processing role of the afferent RFs is best seen by analogy with Self-Organizing Maps <ref> (Kohonen 1982, 1989, 1995) </ref>. The afferent connections self-organize in a similar fashion in both models. When presented with high-dimensional inputs, the self-organizing map selects the set of feature dimensions along which inputs vary the most and represents them along the dimensions of the map. <p> Third, the RF-LISSOM model could be extended to learning of hierarchical visual representations, to discover increasingly complex structures in the input. Other self-organizing algorithms such as the self-organizing map <ref> (Kohonen 1982, 1989, 1995) </ref> do not directly lend themselves to such hierarchical networks. A higher level map will pick up essentially the same features of the input as the lower level map, and represent the same level of information.

These observations suggest that the development of lateral connections, like that of afferent connections, depends on cortical activity driven by external input. New discoveries have also changed the notion that the afferent structures and lateral connections are essentially static after a critical period of early development.

Reference-contexts: To study the effects of cortical lesions, a small set of neurons in the organized network were then made unresponsive to input. Three phases of reorganization wereobserved, like in the somatosensory cortex <ref> (Merzenich et al. 1990) </ref>. Immediately after the lesion, the receptive fields (RFs) of neurons in the perilesion zone enlarge. The lesion reduces the inhibition of the perilesion neurons, and unmasks previously suppressed input activation.

Reference-contexts: If two neurons are active at the same time, their connection is deemed useful and is strengthened. Hebbian learning is usually coupled with normalization so that the efficacies do not grow without bounds but only their relative strengths change <ref> (Miller 1994b) </ref>. A network of such units and connections may develop a globally ordered structure where units represent specific inputs, such as lines of different orientation.

Reference-contexts: separation of the adaptation stimulus and the test stimulus, the computed magnitude of the tilt aftereffect is the difference between the initial perceived angle and the one perceived after adaptation. the figure also shows results from the most detailed recent data available for the tilt aftereffect in human foveal vision <ref> (Mitchell and Muir 1976) </ref>. The results from the model are clearly consistent with those seen in human observers. In the model, the amount of aftereffect increases with adaptation as connection weights gradually change.

Reference-contexts: Such symmetry breaking is similar to that of the Self-Organizing Map (Kohonen 1982, 1989, 1995), where an input feature is represented in the network only if its variance is greater than a threshold proportional to the magnification factor <ref> (Obermayer et al. 1992) </ref>. It is not known whether the long-range lateral connections in the cortex are organized according to size or spatial frequency selectivity. <p> If there are many such feature dimensions, a subset of them will be represented by the folds of the map in the order of their input variance <ref> (Obermayer et al. 1992) </ref>. The images in the visual world could be varying the most along the dimensions of ocular dominance, orientation preference and spatial frequency, and if so, the self-organized RFs will represent these dimensions. During visual processing, the cortex then projects incoming visual inputs onto these dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Such a lesion prevents part of the cortex from receiving input, producing a corresponding cortical scotoma. However, if the surround of the scotoma is stimulated for a period of several minutes, and the scotoma is then removed, the receptive fields of the unstimulated neurons are found to have expanded <ref> (Pettet and Gilbert 1992) </ref>. The expansion is largest along the preferred orientation of each neuron. Psychophysical experiments further show that after removing the scotoma, a stimulus at the edge of the scotoma appears to have shifted towards the center (Kapadia et al. 1994). <p> However, if the perturbation persists for long, synaptic weight changes accumulate, and the topographic map reorganizes substantially. Such receptive field dynamics has been recently observed in the visual cortex <ref> (Pettet and Gilbert 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The perceived orientation thus shifts towards the training orientation. This result is a straightforward consequence of the lateral inhibition theory when the fact of limited synaptic resources is taken into account <ref> (cf. Purves 1988) </ref>, which idea is a major contribution of the RF-LISSOM model. The current results provide strong computational support for the theory that plastic lateral interactions are responsible for the tilt aftereffect as well as the initial self-organization of the orientation detectors.

Reference-contexts: This theory has also been discounted because such fatigue mechanisms have not been found, and cell firing has been shown neither necessary nor sufficient for adaptation (Vidyasagar 1990). The prevailing theory for these effects attributes them to lateral interactions between orientation-specific feature-detectors in the primary visual cortex <ref> (Tolhurst and Thompson 1975) </ref>. The lateral inhibitory connection strengths between activated neurons are believed to increase temporarily while an input pattern is inspected, causing changes in the perception of subsequent orientations. This occurs because the detectors are broadly tuned, and detectors for neighboring orientations also adapt somewhat.

Reference-contexts: Such waves appear to have the necessary sparse structure. (2) Although the natural images may be dense originally, after the edge-enhancement mechanisms in the retina, they also have a sparse structure, with linear features at the local level <ref> (Wandell 1995) </ref>. If retinal preprocessing mechanisms are added, it is likely that the RF-LISSOM network can develop realistic orientation, ocular dominance, and size maps from natural images.
