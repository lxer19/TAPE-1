Title: Cooperative Cleaners a Study in Ant-Robotics

Abstract: In the world of living creatures, "simple minded" animals often cooperate to achieve common goals with amazing performance. One can consider this idea in the context of robotics, and suggest models for programming goal-oriented behavior into the members of a group of simple robots lacking global supervision. This can be done by controlling the local interactions between the robot agents, to have them jointly carry out a given mission. As a test case we analyze the problem of many simple robots cooperating to clean the dirty floor of a non-convex region in Z 2 , using the dirt on the floor as the main means of inter-robot communication.

Reference-contexts: In the CLEAN algorithm we resolve such a problem by giving each robot a priority measure depending on his previous location. But it is an interesting open question whether a coin flipping is better here.

An interesting problem of cleaning and maintenance of a system of pipes by an autonomous robot is discussed in [14]. The importance of cleaning hazardous waste by robots is described in [11]. Our approach is that cleaning is always done at the boundary.

In the spirit of [3], we consider simple robots with only a bounded amount of memory (i.e. a finite-state-machine). Generalizing an idea from computer graphics, <ref> [10] </ref>, we preserve the connectivity of the "dirty" region by allowing an agent to clean only so called non-critical points, points that do not disconnect the graph of dirty grid points. This ensures that the robots will stop only upon completing their mission.

Reference-contexts: for the same shapes with four additional obstacles in each. 11 we show the results for the same figures with additional obstacles, together with the conjectured theoretical bounds. 6 Related Work and Discussion Our cooperative CLEAN-ing algorithm can be considered as a case of social behavior in the sense of <ref> [17] </ref>, where one induces multi-agent cooperation by forcing the agents to obey some simple "social" guidelines. This raises the question what happens if one robot malfunctions. We have shown that if less than k robots stop, the others will take over their responsibilities.
