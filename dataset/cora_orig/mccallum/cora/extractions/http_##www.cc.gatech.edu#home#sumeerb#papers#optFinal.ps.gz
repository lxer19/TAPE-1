Title: Responsiveness and Consistency Tradeoffs in Interactive Groupware  
Author: Sumeer Bhola Guruduth Banavar Mustaque Ahamad 
Abstract: Interactive (or Synchronous) groupware is increasingly being deployed in widely distributed environments. Users of such applications are accustomed to direct manipulation interfaces that require fast response time. The state that enables interaction among distributed users can be replicated to provide acceptable response time in the presence of high communication latencies. We describe and evaluate design choices for protocols that maintain consistency of such state. In particular, we develop workloads which model user actions, identify the metrics important from a user's viewpoint, and do detailed simulations of a number of protocols to evaluate how effective they are in meeting user requirements. Keywords: Replication, Consistency, Response Time, Performance Evaluation, Workloads.
