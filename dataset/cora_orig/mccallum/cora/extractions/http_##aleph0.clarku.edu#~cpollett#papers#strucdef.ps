Abstract: 2 , S i 2 are closely connected with complexity theory. This paper is motivated by the questions: what are the b i+1 -definable multifunctions of R i 2 ? and when is one theory conservative over another? To answer these questions we consider theories ^ R i 2 , ^ S i ^ T i 2 where induction is restricted to prenex formulas. We also define ^ T i;t 2 which has induction up to the 0 or 1-ary L 2 -terms in the set t . We show ^ S i 2 and ^ T i 2 . We show that the ^ b i (wit; log log). For ^ b i+k+2 -definability we get F P p i+k+1 (wit; 1) for all these theories. Write 2 _t for the set of terms 2 min(`(x);jxj) where ` is a finite product of terms in t . We prove ^ T i;2 _t i+1 ) i+1;t 2 and we show ^ T i;t ^ b i+1 IN D t provided t O 2 (jidj). This gives a proof theoretic proof that t O 2 (jidj), we define ^ C i;t 2 . We show if T i 2 where t 0 has an unbounded term then P H = B( p separate P p i (A) (fjj`jjg) from P p i (A) (fjj`jj 2 g) for behaved ` and deduce theory separations. We lastly introduce a notion of a model separating two theories and derive some consequences. Key words: bounded arithmetic, complexity theory, multivalued functions, conservation results, oracle separations 1 Introduction

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Three families of bounded arithmetic theories, R i 2 , S i 2 , were developed in Buss <ref> [7] </ref>, Allen [1],Clote-Takeuti [11], and Takeuti [28]. These theories have been studied because of their close connection to computational com plexity. <p> It is known that the b i -definable functions of S i 2 are F P p i1 , those Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 7 January 1999 functions computable in polynomial time with access to a p i1 -oracle <ref> [7] </ref>. The b 1 -definable functions of R 1 2 are the circuit class F N C. It is also known for i &gt; 1 that S i 2 is b i -conservative over T i1 2 . <p> In Section 2, we introduce various arithmetic theories. Our base theory is EBASIC which extends BASIC from Buss <ref> [7] </ref> with axioms for M SP and : as well as three open axioms that allow a form of pairing. We define ^ T i;t 2 and also the classical bounded arithmetic theories R i 2 , S i 2 . <p> The exponential function is not provably total in bounded arithmetic so we need the function # to do sequence coding. BASIC consists of all substitution instances of a finite set of quantifier free axioms for the non-logical symbols of L 2 . These axioms are listed in Buss <ref> [7] </ref> with the exception of the axioms for M SP and : which are listed in Takeuti [28]. For k 2, BASIC k is BASIC plus the additional axioms jx# j yj = jxj# j1 jyj where 2 &lt; j k. <p> This hierarchy corresponds in a natural way to the polynomial time hierarchy. In the standard model b i -formulas describe exactly predicates in p i . Similarly, b i -formulas correspond to p i -predicates. This correspondence is proven in Buss <ref> [7] </ref>. 5 We define the prenex bounded arithmetic hierarchy as follows: ^ b 0 are those formulas of the form (9x jsj) and ^ b 0 are those formulas of the form (8x jsj) where is an open formula. ^ b i are those formulas of the form (9x t) where <p> We use the predicate x &lt; y as an abbreviation for Sx y. The above definitions are all L 2 -terms so can be used freely in an L 2 -formula without increasing its quantifier complexity. It is a theorem of Buss <ref> [7] </ref> that once we can b 1 -define a function f in a bounded arithmetic theory we can add the function symbol to the theory without changing the b i or b i -consequences of the theory i 1. A similar result holds for adding b 1 -predicate symbols [7]. <p> Buss <ref> [7] </ref> that once we can b 1 -define a function f in a bounded arithmetic theory we can add the function symbol to the theory without changing the b i or b i -consequences of the theory i 1. A similar result holds for adding b 1 -predicate symbols [7]. We will not need this more general result, however. ^ fi and _ fi allow some sequence manipulation in our theories. <p> In general, ^ T i;t 2 proves ^ b i1 REP L ftg provided t O 2 (jidj). PROOF. This proof is essentially the same as the proof that was used in Buss <ref> [7] </ref> to show the theory S i 2 has b Remark 21 Having replacement for ^ b i1 -formulas implies replacement for both ^ b i2 and ^ b i2 -formulas, since adding dummy quantifiers to formulas in the latter two classes makes them into ^ b i1 -formulas. <p> To show the converse of Theorem 35; however, we work in the sequent calculus reformulating the induction and replacement axioms as rules of inference. Buss <ref> [7] </ref> or Takeuti [27] describe the sequent calculus. Definition 41 A IN D t inference is an inference: A (b); !A (Sb); where b is an eigenvariable and must not appear in the lower sequent, t 2 L k , ` 2 t , and A 2 . <p> Let t O 2 (jidj). A REP L t inference is an inference of the form: !(8x `(s (a)))(9y t (x; a))A (x; y); 26 where A 2 , ` 2 t , s; t 2 L k , and m := t fl (`(s); a). Buss <ref> [7] </ref> has shown that one gets the same theory if one formulates S i 2 or T i with induction axioms or induction rules. The same sorts of proof work in the ^ T 2 and ^ C 2 case [23]. <p> The proof relies on cut-elimination and is the same as in the S i 2 and T i 2 case which are in Buss <ref> [7] </ref>. We write A t to mean a quantifier (8x `(t)) where ` 2 t and t 2 L 2 . Similarly, we write E t to mean a quantifier (9x `(t)) where ` 2 t and t 2 L 2 . <p> The witness predicate above is simplified from Buss <ref> [7] </ref>. The simplification arises because we are in the prenex setting. <p> Theorem 68 (i 0) Let t O 2 (jidj). Then ^ C i;t i;t PROOF. The proof is the same as the proof in Buss <ref> [7] </ref> that S i 2 is contained in S 1 i+1 REP L. 2 To show ^ T i;t ^ C 2 we first show ^ T i;t ^ C 2 .

Reference-contexts: Another motivating question was whether R i 2 is b i -conservative over S i1 2 . This is a reasonable conjecture since S i 2 is b i -conservative over T i1 2 from Buss <ref> [8] </ref>. Buss, Krajcek, and Takeuti [10] were not able to solve this problem but did show that if the theories had a slightly faster growth rate function # 3 in the language then the result held. <p> Since the prenex versions of T i 2 and S i 2 are the same as the non prenex versions this result can be used to show S i 2 is B ( ^ b i )-conservative over T i1 2 a slight strengthening of Buss <ref> [8] </ref>. For R i 2 using a modification of this result we get R i 2 is B ( ^ b i )-conservative over ^ R i 2 . <p> In addition, A (x; w; 0) must be provable equivalent to a ^ b 0 -formula in T and T must prove (9w t)A (x; w; 0). The formula B is called a Q i;t -definition of f . Buss <ref> [8] </ref> gives a variant of Q i;t -definition. <p> The other results follow from the ^ T i;t 2 result and Definition 33. We are using the fact that jjjxjjj is in fi (log log (jxj)). 2 The T i 2 result was essentially known from Buss <ref> [8] </ref> and the S i 2 result follows from Krajcek [18] using the construction of M 0 from M which was in Buss, Krajcek, Takeuti [10]. Corollary 49 (i 1) The ^ b i+1 -predicates of ^ T i;t i (jt j). <p> definition of B implies f (x) = 1 , B (x; 1) , A (x) and the predicate f (x) = 1 will be in P p i (jt j) by essentially the same argument used in Lemma 37. 2 The T i 2 result above was known from Buss <ref> [8] </ref> and the S i 2 result is similar to a result in Krajcek [18]. <p> So ^ T i;2 _t k+2 proves A (a). The remaining parts of the theorem are special cases of the first statement. 2 The proof of Theorem 57 was adapted from the proof in Buss <ref> [8] </ref> that T i i REP L B ( b 2 : Below are two interesting corollary of the above theorem. Corollary 58 (i 1; m n 0; k 2) Let t O 2 (jidj m ). <p> This was previously shown in Buss, Krajcek, and Takeuti [10] using a model theoretic argument of Ressayre that S i 2 b i S i i+1 REP L fjidjg . We use two known results: (1) the result of Buss <ref> [8] </ref> that S i 2 proves b 0 ( b i )-LIND and (2) the witnessing argument for b i -formulas in Krajcek [18]. <p> The ^ R i 2 result and the general result are new. Theorem 60 (i 1) S i 2 proves the b i+1 -LIN D axioms. PROOF. By Buss <ref> [8] </ref>, S i 2 proves b 0 ( b i )-LIND. Let A be b i+1 with respect to S i i+1 and let A 2 b i+1 be equivalent to A in S i 2 . <p> We first show ^ T i;t 2 proves b 0;t ( ^ b IN D _t . For this we use the next two theorems, which are modified from Buss <ref> [8] </ref>. First, we define a bit comprehension axiom. 40 Definition 61 Let t O 2 (jidj). The -COM P t are the axioms COMP ` ff : where ff 2 and ` 2 t . Theorem 62 (i 1) Let t O 2 (jidj).

Reference-contexts: The b 1 -definable functions of R 1 2 are the circuit class F N C. It is also known for i &gt; 1 that S i 2 is b i -conservative over T i1 2 . Krajcek <ref> [17] </ref> shows that the b i -definable multifunctions of S i1 2 are F P p i1 (wit; log), those multifunctions computed by Turing machines running in polynomial time with only logarithmically many queries to a p i1 -oracle such that if the oracle answers `1' to a query it also <p> Let A be b i+1 with respect to S i i+1 and let A 2 b i+1 be equivalent to A in S i 2 . Consider B (x; y) := Certainly, S i 2 proves (8x)(9y 1)B (x; y). Thus, by the witnessing theorem in <ref> [17] </ref> (which is similar to the t = fjidjg case of Theorem 45), there is a g 2 F P p i (wit; log) such that S i 2 ` W it i+1 inition of the witness predicate, S i 2 ` W it i+1 also S i 2 ` W <p> So any term in j _ f`gj can be bounded by some term of the form e j`(s)j where e is fixed s 2 L 2 . Our oracle construction follows <ref> [17] </ref>. By Corollary 50 and Corollary 49, a predicate in P p i (fjj`jjg) can be written as (9v e j`(s (x))j)[A (x; v) ^ :B (x; v + 1)] where A; B 2 p i , and s 2 L 2 and e is fixed.

Corollary 50 (i 1) ^ T i;t 2 proves its ^ b i+1 -predicates can be written in the form (9v `(s (x)))[A (x; v) ^ :B (x; v + 1)] where A; B 2 ^ b i , ` 2 _t and PROOF. <p> We use two known results: (1) the result of Buss [8] that S i 2 proves b 0 ( b i )-LIND and (2) the witnessing argument for b i -formulas in Krajcek <ref> [18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Three families of bounded arithmetic theories, R i 2 , S i 2 , were developed in Buss [7], Allen [1],Clote-Takeuti [11], and Takeuti <ref> [28] </ref>. These theories have been studied because of their close connection to computational com plexity. <p> BASIC consists of all substitution instances of a finite set of quantifier free axioms for the non-logical symbols of L 2 . These axioms are listed in Buss [7] with the exception of the axioms for M SP and : which are listed in Takeuti <ref> [28] </ref>. For k 2, BASIC k is BASIC plus the additional axioms jx# j yj = jxj# j1 jyj where 2 &lt; j k. We enlarge the syntax of first-order logic to include bounded quantifiers.
