Title: A Reduction-Graph Model of Ratio Decidendi  
Author: L. Karl Branting 
Address: 82071-3682  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Wyoming Laramie, Wyoming  
Abstract: This paper proposes a model of ratio decidendi as a justification structure consisting of a series of reasoning steps, some of which relate abstract predicates to other abstract predicates and some of which relate abstract predicates to specific facts. This model satisfies four adequacy criteria for ratio decidendi identified from the jurisprudential literature. In particular, the model shows how the theory under which a case is decided controls its precedential effect. By contrast, a purely case-based model of ratio fails to account for the dependency of precedential effect on the theory of decision.

Reference-contexts: This case-description language must be capable of expressing any legally significant distinctions among the facts of cases.

A second requirement is a mechanism for exemplar-based reasoning. The hypotheticals posed in the context of Bourhill were contrived to minimize problems of case matching. In reality, few pairs of distinct cases can be found with identical material facts.

This refinement would represent a departure from Goodhart's view. this reduction graph. This collection comprises the warrants in the precedent's justification that satisfy Wambaugh's criterion: if any such warrant were false, then the decision would no longer follow from the facts of the case.

Reference-contexts: These factors, or dimensions, provide criteria for determining the "most on-point" precedents and a mechanism for generating arguments based on a comparison between a new case and precedents. The final approach is the "prototype-plus-deformation" model used in TAXMAN II and described in <ref> [MS82] </ref>. Under this model, a legal argument for a particular classification is modeled as a set of transformations that includes all the exemplars of the classification and the given case. A counter-argument consists of a set of transformations that includes the exemplars but excludes the given case.
