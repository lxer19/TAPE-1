Abstract: In this paper we determine that the best constant of the inequality R 1 0 y 0 2 K 3=3. Our approach consists of reducing the problem to various equivalent inequalities on a finite interval and

Reference-contexts: To establish some motivation for our efforts, we remark that estimates of the best constant of this and other types of multiplicative inequalities can be used to establish nonoscillation criteria as well as spectral lower bounds for differential operators (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>, [6], [12]). <p> We give below a more elementary proof. Let ae be a C 1 function with support in [0; 2) such that 0 ae (t) 1 and ae (t) = 1 if t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Set z = ae (t=t 0 )y for some fixed t 0 &gt; 0 which we will determine. <p> To get Q (z) &gt; 2, we substitute the more complicated test function (which, after a horizontal scaling, can be considered to be in Z 2 ) z = x 2 ; in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> Direct computation gives K &gt; Q (z) = 23 + 4 2 ffi Lemma 6. Define Z 3 = fz 2 Z 2 : z (1) &gt; 0; z 0 (1) &gt; 0g : Then K (Z 3 ) = K. Proof. <p> By the definition of Z 9 , z belongs to Z 7 or Z 8 . Case 1: Suppose z 2 Z 7 . If z 62 Z 10 , then z 00 6= C in <ref> [fi; 1] </ref>. We can replace z [fi;1] by a function u such that u 00 = C, as in Lemma 8. Note that u will be defined in a shorter interval [0; fl] with fi &lt; fl &lt; 1. <p> Suppose that the domain of u is now <ref> [ffi; 1] </ref>. Then Q (u) = Q (z). We may assume without loss of generality that z has been chosen so that Q (z) Q (u (ffi;b] ) for all b 2 (ffi; fi): (3.7) Otherwise, we can replace z by a better choice constructed as follows. <p> If u 00 6= C in <ref> [fi; 1] </ref>, we can modify u in that part to form a new function such that v 00 = C on [fi; fl], as in Case 1. <p> Let Z 13 = fz 2 Z 12 : fl = 0g ; which consists of exactly the quadratic polynomials in Z 10 such that z 00 = C on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Then K (Z 13 ) = K: Proof. Let z 2 Z 12 .

Reference-contexts: Thus far, the value of K p has been discovered in only two cases: p = 2 is the classic inequality of Hardy and Littlewood <ref> [4, Theorem 239] </ref> and K 2 = 2; p = 1 is a special case of an inequality considered by Arestov|here K 1 is also 2 (cf.
