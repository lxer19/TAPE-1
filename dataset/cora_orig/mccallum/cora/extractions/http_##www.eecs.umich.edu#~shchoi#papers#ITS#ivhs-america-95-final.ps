Abstract: We propose a most-urgent-first (MUF) protocol to solve the problem of accessing the reverse traffic channels where mobile clients compete for use of the channels to convey their requests to the server. We also present a method for evaluating the urgency of each client's request for traffic information. The MUF protocol gives more urgent requests higher priority, responds faster to more important inquiries, accommodates more clients in each channel, and allows information sharing among a potentially large number of clients. Moreover, all services can be provided in real-time. Finally, we have developed an UltraSAN model [1] to evaluate the performance of the MUF protocol. Some of the issues related to the operation of the MUF protocol are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: We have developed an UltraSAN model <ref> [1] </ref> to simulate the operation of the MUF protocol based on the following assumptions: 1. The channel timing is the same as that in IS-54. 2. There are only active clients, since no passive client will compete for the slots of reverse channels. 3. <p> A method for the evaluation 10 of urgency for ATIS traffic related information was also given as an example of combining time and the (perceived) importance of requests. An UltraSAN model <ref> [1] </ref> was developed and simulations performed. The results obtained from the experiments are very encouraging. We have also discussed some of the issues related to the operation of MUF protocol in the presence of other types of applications.

Reference-contexts: In a digital cellular/PCN environment, one can usually assume that the servers are capable of real-time information collection and request processing, both of which depend on real-time communication in wired networks (either point-to-point networks <ref> [2] </ref> or fast multiple-access local area networks [3]) and the ability to dynamically schedule and execute tasks [4, 5]. The remaining two conditions in the above list, however, have not been addressed adequately.
