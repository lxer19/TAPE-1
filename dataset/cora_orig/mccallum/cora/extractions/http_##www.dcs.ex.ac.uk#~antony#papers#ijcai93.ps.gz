Title: Towards an integrated logic of space, time, and motion  
Author: Antony Galton 
Address: Exeter, UK  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Exeter  
Abstract: In this paper we show how Allen's temporal logic, with the modifications suggested by Galton to enable it to accommodate continuity phenomena, can be combined with the spatial logic of Randall, Cui and Cohn to yield a useful framework for reasoning about the motion of a rigid body in space. The idea of a perturbation is introduced as the key to providing a qualitative account of continuity, and a set of axioms is given from which an important result called the Perturbation Principle is derivable. Finally it is shown how the system enables various types of events to be defined in terms of their conditions of occurrence.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over the last ten years logical systems for handling time have become commonplace in AI. The interval-based system of (Allen 1984) has become widely adopted in this area. A number of authors have suggested enhancements or modifications to it. My own <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> is particularly relevant to the current paper, because it starts to take space, motion, and continuity seriously in a way that Allen did not. (Galton 1991) suggests a reworking of the syntax (unreification), which however I shall not follow here: the reified system here can in principle be unreified <p> I argued in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> that he should have admitted points as well; here I argue analogously for the need for spatial points, a possibility explicitly considered, though not actually advocated, by RCCb. <p> ! PO For point bodies, the perturbation diagrams are much simpler: 1. p is a point body, q is a spatial point: = ! 6= 2. p is a point body, r is a region: Outside ! Bounds ! Inside 5 6 States of Position and States of Motion In <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> I introduced a distinction between what I called states of position and states of motion. <p> Many events can be defined in terms of state changes. This is especially obvious in the case of motion in space. As suggested in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>, we shall replace Allen's predicate Occurs by three predicates Occurs-on, Occurs-in, and Occurs-at. If e is an event type then Occurs-in (e; i) says that an event of type e occurs during the interval i. <p> (Bounds (pos (p); r); sup (i)) ^ Holds-on (Inside (pos (p); r); i) In general, events involving point bodies are simpler to describe than those involving extended bodies since there are fewer RCC-type relations to consider. 11 10 Conclusion We took the temporal logic of (Allen 1984), as modified by <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>, and combined it with the spatial logic of (Randell et al. 1992a, Randell et al. 1992b) to produce a simple but expressive logic of space, time, and continuous motion for rigid bodies. <p> Continuity was ensured by means of the Perturbation Principle, which makes use of the distinction between states of position and states of motion introduced in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>. A set of axioms was given from which the Perturbation Principle follows. In addition we showed how we could use our system to define a variety of event-types by specifying their occurrence conditions in terms of the elementary positional relations on bodies and regions.
