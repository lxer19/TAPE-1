Reference-contexts: The state of the art for performing the global combine on hypercubes is described in [5]. Earlier work on 2-D mesh combining is reported in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We further compare those results with the performance model predictions presented in that section. The Intel Touchstone DELTA computer system is a prototype 2-D mesh multicomputer that incorporates a 16fi32 mesh of i860/XR processing nodes with a wormhole routing interconnection network <ref> [3] </ref>. Its communication characteristics are described in [4]. Some of the DELTA's characteristics are particu larly important to understand our experimental results.

Reference-contexts: For example, with this approach it is easy to model the effects of using different communication protocols at various steps of the algorithm, an enhancement that can make a significant improvement on some machines <ref> [4] </ref>. However, to gain more insight, it is helpful to reduce the summation to a closed-form expression. <p> We further compare those results with the performance model predictions presented in that section. The Intel Touchstone DELTA computer system is a prototype 2-D mesh multicomputer that incorporates a 16fi32 mesh of i860/XR processing nodes with a wormhole routing interconnection network [3]. Its communication characteristics are described in <ref> [4] </ref>. Some of the DELTA's characteristics are particu larly important to understand our experimental results. <p> Short messages are faster if "unforced", in which case typical values are ff fan = 75sec and fi net = 0:8sec . * Two operating system kernels are available on the DELTA <ref> [4] </ref>. In order to illustrate the performance of the basic DELTA technology, we used the "fast" kernel. Under the more robust produc tion kernel, most timings would approximately double.
