Abstract: During the past decade, information technology has evolved to where it is economically viable to store and retrieve continuous media data types, e.g., audio and video objects. Systems that support this data type are expected to play a major role in many applications including library information systems, entertainment technology, and educational applications. The objects of this new data type should be retrieved at a pre-specified bandwidth. If an object is retrieved at a rate lower than its pre-specified bandwidth then its display will suffer from frequent disruptions and delays termed hiccups. This paper describes staggered striping as a novel technique to support a hiccup-free retrieval of continuous media data types. Its design is based on a multidisk architecture. It is a flexible technique that can support media types whose bandwidth requirements are either lower or higher than the bandwidth of a single disk. Its design allows a system to scale to thousands of disk drives as its incurred overhead is fixed and does not increase as a function of additional disk drives. fl This research was supported in part by grants from AT&T/NCR/Teradata, Hewlett-Packard, IBM grant SJ92488, NSF grants IRI-9110522, IRI-9203389, and CDA-9216321 and DARPA contract DABT63-91-C-0001.

Reference-contexts: While it is effective, there are applications that cannot tolerate loss of data (e.g., medical data, the video signals collected from space by NASA <ref> [Doz92] </ref>). As an alternative, one may use a lossless compression technique (e.g., Huffman, Lempel Ziv, etc.). The reduction with lossless techniques is anywhere from a factor of 2 to 15, with lossy techniques it ranges from a factor of 10 to 500 [Fox91].

Reference-contexts: The fragments of a subobject (say X 1 ) are constructed using a round-robin assignment of its blocks to each disk drive (see Figure 1), allowing the system to overlap the display of X 1 with its retrieval from the disk drives (multi-input pipelining <ref> [GR93, GRAQ91] </ref>). This minimizes the amount of memory required for buffering the data. However, in practice, some memory is needed per disk drive to eliminate hiccups that may arise due to disk seeks incurred when the system switches from one cluster to another (described further in Section 3).

Recommendation 601 of the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) calls for a 216 mbps bandwidth for video objects. A video object based on the HDTV (High Definition TeleVision) quality images requires approximately 800 mbps bandwidth. Future demands for higher bandwidths are expected.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the capacity of each disk drive is approximately 8 gigabytes 6 . The Tertiary Storage device provides a 110 mbps bandwidth (e.g., Ampex DST drive <ref> [Joh93] </ref>). The Centralized Scheduler implements an Object Manager, a Disk Manager, and a Tertiary Manager. The Object Manager maintains the availability of different objects on the disk drives.

Reference-contexts: All of the above schemes, as well as the staggered striping scheme presented in this paper, are "demand driven" in the sense that streams are assumed to responses to specific requests for delivery of an object. Another approach is the "data driven" scheme presented in <ref> [OBRS94] </ref> in which it is assumed that a given object (e.g., a movie) will be delivered at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). Under this regime it is shown that a clever organization of the data can make the delivery of these multiple streams more efficient.

Reference-contexts: In summary, as one increases the size of a fragment, the display latency increases (undesirable) while the effective disk bandwidth increases (desirable). To illustrate, a typical 1.2 gigabyte disk drive <ref> [Sab90] </ref> consists of 1635 cylinders, each with a capacity of 756000 bytes. Its peak transfer rate is 24.19 mbps. Its minimum, average, and maximum disk seek times are 4, 15, and 35 milliseconds respectively. Its average and maximum disk latency are 8.33 and 16.83 milliseconds respectively.
