Title: A Framework for the Success Factors in the Information System Development Process  
Author: Geoff Beckworth, Professor Brian Garner 
Address: Geelong, Vic. 3217, Australia  
Affiliation: School of Computing and Mathematics Deakin University,  
Abstract: The role of systems analysis has changed dramatically in the last ten years because of changes to organisational boundaries, the need to align IT with business needs and the complexity of the systems now required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing environment. Establishing strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding of process and change management. The requirements elicitation process begins with Information System Planning and continues through to developing a Requirements Specification. The research is attempting to understand the critical factors associated with the process. A dynamic process will be developed which will be appropriate in situations where the time frame is limited and there is the potential for considerable change.
