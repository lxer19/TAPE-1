Abstract: We consider an epidemiological dataset, concerned with predicting pulmonary response to air pollution. To gain more knowledge of nonlinear effects and interactions in the data, nonlinear neural network techniques were applied to model the data. Initially, we modelled the data with standard feedforward network models. Based on the epidemiologic effect of heterogeneity in response, we propose a novel combined neural network modelling strategy to improve prediction quality. Also, we propose the use of a neural network strategy for reducing correlation between co-variants to improve modelling quality. The results presented are promising when compared to standard feedforward network modelling.

Reference-contexts: Any form of relation between the covariates and the outcome variable can be represented by the model. Some advocate that modelling complex relations is essentially impossible without introducing carefully designed biases, in the form of a priori assumptions about the processes studied, into the model <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>. Nonetheless, non-parametric methods, or black box methods, remain useful tools in epidemiological research. They enable the exploration of exposure-response relations without a priori assumptions such as linearity. The interactions between covariates are an important issue in epidemiological studies. Multiple co-variates often affect the response variable.

Reference-contexts: Modelling such interactions requires flexibility and often nonlinearity of the model. For example, we are interested in relations between ambient levels of air pollution and changes in daily Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) measurements for children. By modelling the acquired data with a non-parametric feedforward network <ref> [5] </ref>, changes in mod elled PEF as a result of changing the values of partic-ular covariates, or combinations of covariates, can be visualised, even if complex interactions are present in these relations. <p> Reactions to similar changes in exposure may differ among individuals, without the presence of confounding issues such as age, sex or race, but for the fact that they are simply different individuals. We propose a method that combines LVQ networks <ref> [6, 5] </ref> and feed-forward networks to deal with issues of heterogeneity, which is discussed in Section 3. Experiments aimed at reducing correlations between input variables are also discussed in Section 3. Through the application of non-linear autoencoding networks, correlation between time lagged measurements of the same covariant is reduced.

Reference-contexts: Conclusions and final thoughts are summarized in Section 4. 2 Other NN applications This section describes two examples of previous applications within epidemiological studies. Both experiments involve the application of feedforward network models to fairly large datasets. A study by Moseholm et al. <ref> [7] </ref> applied nonlinear feedforward network models to estimate pulmonary response of subjects with asthma to gaseous air-pollution, weather, and medicine intake. Two datasets (n=918, and n=955) gathered from different cities were used and an independent test set (n=422) was reserved for testing purposes.

Reference-contexts: Nonlinear relations between weather and pulmonary response were found by analyzing such plots. Correlations between observed and estimated PEF values in the test set of approximately 0.52 were reported (ideally, this value is 1). Another approach was taken by Waschulzik et al. <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, new synthesized variables express previously complex profiles of exposure in fewer variables, and form more concise descriptions of exposure conditions, thus facilitating interpretation of the models. Using DeMers' Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) neural network <ref> [9] </ref>, we described the eight time-lagged PEF input variables in three new synthisized variables. The method eliminates units in a designated hidden layer of an nonlinear autoen-coding feedforward network by penalizing variance of their activation.
