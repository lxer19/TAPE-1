Abstract: Recent measurements of local-area and wide-area traffic have shown that network traffic exhibits variability at a wide range of scales. In this paper, we examine a mechanism that gives rise to self-similar network traffic and present some of its performance implications. The mechanism we study is the transfer of files or messages whose size is drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. First, we show that in a realistic client/server network environmenti.e., one with bounded resources and coupling among traffic sources competing for resourcesthe degree to which file sizes are heavy-tailed can directly determine the degree of traffic self-similarity at the link level. We show that this causal relationship is robust with respect to changes in network resources (bottleneck bandwidth and buffer capacity), network topology, the influence of cross-traffic, and the distribution of interarrival times. Second, we show that properties of the transport layer play an important role in preserving and modulating this relationship. In particular, the reliable transmission and flow control mechanisms of TCP (Reno, Tahoe, or Vegas) serve to maintain the long-range dependency structure induced by heavy-tailed file size distributions. In contrast, if a non-flow-controlled and unreliable (UDP-based) transport protocol is used, the resulting traffic shows little self-similarity: although still bursty at short time scales, it has little long-range dependence. Third, we show performance implications of self-similarity as represented by performance measures including packet loss rate, retransmission rate, and queueing delay. Increased self-similarity, as expected, results in degradation of performance. Queueing delay, in particular, exhibits a drastic increase with increasing self-similarity.

This graceful decline in TCP's performance under self-similar loads comes at a cost: a disproportionate increase in the consumption of buffer space. <p> In these simulations, communication is unreliable; they use a UDP-based transport protocol which is driven by an extremely greedy application whose output rate, upon receiving a client request, was essentially only bounded by the local physical link bandwidth. (The flow-controlled case is described in <ref> [17] </ref>.) The H-estimates show that as source burstiness is increased, the estimated Hurst parameter of the down-stream traffic decreases relative to its value in the upstream traffic. Another interesting point is the already low Hurst estimate of the up-stream traffic for Pareto ff = 1:05. <p> A comprehensive study of the performance implications of self-similarity including quality-of-service (QoS) issues, resource trade-offs, and performance comparisons between TCP Reno, Tahoe, and Vegas can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. 4.7.1 Performance evaluation under reliable commu nication We evaluated network performance when both traffic self-similarity (ff of Pareto file size distribution) and network resources (bottleneck bandwidth and buffer capacity) were varied. <p> A similar trade-off relation exists for queueing delay and throughput. The effect of varying bandwidth to obtain the trade-off graphs and evaluation of the marginal benefit of network resources are discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>. 4.7.2 Performance evaluation under unreliable com munication Performance evaluations under unreliable, non-flow-controlled transport yield performance results that are significantly worse than their reliable, flow-controlled counterparts. <p> The su-perlinear dependence of queueing delay on the degree of self-similarity is further amplified, and so are trade-off relations between queueing delay and throughput. These results are omitted due to space constraints and can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we have shown that self-similarity in network traffic can arise due to a particularly simple cause: the reliable transfer of files drawn from heavy-tailed distributions.

Such scale-invariant variability is in strong contrast to traditional models of network traffic, which show variability at short time scales but are essentially smooth at large time scales; i.e., they lack long-range dependence. <p> Properties of the transport/network layer in the protocol stack are shown to play an important role in mediating this causal relationship. The mechanism we propose is motivated by the ON/OFF model <ref> [24] </ref>. The ON/OFF model shows that self-similarity can arise in an idealized contexti.e., one with unbounded resources and independent traffic sourcesas a result of aggregating a large number of 0/1 renewal processes whose ON or OFF periods are heavy-tailed. <p> The success of this simple, elegant model in capturing the characteristics of measured traffic traces <ref> [24] </ref> is surprising given that it ignores nonlinearities arising from the interaction of traffic sources contending for network resources, which in real networks, can be as complicated as the feedback congestion control algorithm of TCP Reno. <p> degree of self-similarity and network resources are varied. 2 Related work Since the seminal study of Leland et al. [12] which set the groundwork for considering self-similar network traffic as an important modeling and performance evaluation problem, a string of work has appeared dealing with various aspects of traffic self-similarity <ref> [1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 19, 24] </ref>. The research avenues may be broadly classified into two categories. <p> The research avenues may be broadly classified into two categories. In the first category <ref> [7, 9, 10, 12, 19, 24] </ref>, traffic traces from physical network measurements are employed to identify the presence of scale-invariant burstiness, and models are constructed capable of generating synthetic traffic with matching characteristics. These papers show that long-range dependence is an ubiquitous phenomenon encompassing both local-area and wide-area network traffic. <p> We have also shown that reliability and flow control mechanisms in the transport layer of the protocol stack give rise to a traffic-shaping effect that preserves self-similarity in network traffic. This helps explain why the ON/OFF model <ref> [24] </ref>, in spite of ignoring traffic interactions through resource limitations and feedback control, has been successful in modeling observed traffic characteristics.
