Reference-contexts: For example, if the OB were initially constructed from English, its system of honorifics would probably contain only two items, one for and the other for ; a Japanese LB would cause this system to be fleshed out to include a more elaborate substructure along the lines described in <ref> [Bateman 88] </ref>. the LB item represents aspects of more than one OB items. This is the case the new language partitions the phenomenon under consideration in a different way to the previous language (s) studied.

Reference-contexts: But since our intention is MT, this poses no problem. An example of the abstractions that can be used as high-level organization for English is the Penman Upper Model <ref> [Bateman et al. 89] </ref>, a taxonomy that has been used to support the generation of English text in several domains. It will be noted that the example terms employed above are semantic rather than syntactic (e.g., rather than ). <p> ontologies and domain models developed at the Center for Machine Translation at CMU, using the ONTOS acquisition interface [Monarch 89], IR, the Intermediate Representation terminology used at the Computing Research Laboratory of New Mexico State University [Farwell 90], and the Upper Model developed for the Penman language generator at USC/ISI <ref> [Bateman et al. 89] </ref>. Both CMT's and IR have already been used to support Interlingual machine translation of several languages, while variants of the Upper Model suited for German, Japanese, and Chinese are under construction at GMD/IPSI (Germany) and the University of Sydney (Australia).
