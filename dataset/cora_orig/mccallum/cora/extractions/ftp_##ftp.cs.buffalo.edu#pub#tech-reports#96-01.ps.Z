Title: Testing membership in unitriangular matrix groups Preliminary draft  
Author: Gabor Ivanyos 
Date: January 2, 1996  
Abstract: We present an algorithm that, given a subgroup G of the group of the upper triangular matrices with rational entries by a set of generators, computes generators of the lower central series of G. As an application, we show that the constructive membership problem in G can be performed in polynomial time. This draft is intended to be part of a larger project investigating the complexity of computational problems in finitely generated linear groups.

Reference-contexts: To keep the size of the basis elements polynomial, in each round, we take S i such that log S i is a reduced basis (in the sense of <ref> [LLL] </ref>) of the lattice log G i + L i+1 =L i+1 . To prove that it works we have to show that the lattice log G i + L i+1 =L i+1 is of polynomial size (i.e., admits a basis of polynomial size).
