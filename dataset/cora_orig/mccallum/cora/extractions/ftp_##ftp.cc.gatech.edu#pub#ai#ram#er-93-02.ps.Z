Abstract: Reading has been studied for decades by both artificial intelligent researchers and by cognitive psychologists. Yet there still does not exist a theory which accurately describes the process nor a computer system which performs it. To overcome the shortfalls of previous systems, we have developed a functional theory of the reading comprehension process. The theory not only enables us to implement a model of the reading task, the ISAAC (Integrated Story Analysis And Comprehension) system; it also allows us to analyze past systems and their problems more completely and in a common framework. We also use this paper to present our general research philosophy, the current level of the implementation of our ideas, and our plans for future research.

Reference-contexts: This suspension of disbelief is strongest in the science fiction domain, which is one reason we chose it for our research. 5 An example The following is an excerpt from a short story we are working with, Men Are Different by Alan Bloch <ref> [1] </ref>. I'm an archaeologist, and Men are my business. Just the same, I wonder if we'll ever find out about MenI mean really find out what made Man different from us Robotsby digging around on the dead planets.

G. </author> <title> Derivational analogy: A theory of reconstructive problem solving and expertise acquisition. </title> <booktitle> In Readings in Machine Learning, </booktitle> <editor> J. W. Shavlik and T. G. Dietterich, Eds. </editor> <publisher> Morgan Kauf-mann Publishers, Inc., </publisher> <address> San Mateo, California, </address> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: These creative applica tions of past experience will happen in two primary fashions. First, ISAAC will be able to directly adapt solutions from past episodes to fit the current problem. Second, ISAAC will be able to use past creative experiences in much the same fashion as Carbonell's derivational replay <ref> [2] </ref> in order to produce creative solutions. Both of these techniques will enable ISAAC to act in a creative fashion during the reading experience, allowing it to come to a creative understanding of the story.

Reference-contexts: The part of the reader's mind which is anchored in reality understands that time travel is impossible at this point in time. Yet, to make sense of the story, it is necessary to make use of a willing suspension of disbelief <ref> [3] </ref>. To some degree, this must occur in all reading. No one really believes that the defense attorney's investigator is able to find the crucial piece of data just in time to save the client's case; it just makes the story a nicer one to read.

Reference-contexts: Finally, our theory enables us to efficiently examine older reading systems and see why they were unable to handle the complete reading task. Early systems such as SAM <ref> [4] </ref> and PAM [10] were attempts to handle episodic understanding through scripts and plans.

Reference-contexts: Dyer's BORIS system was an integrated approach which tried to bring together the current theories of its time; unfortunately, it became too much of an engineering task to give BORIS the knowledge it needed for more than two short stories. CYRUS <ref> [6] </ref> was an implementation of the memory management supertask but sacrificed the rest of the reading process. The later system, AQUA [7], contributed to the explanation and reasoning supertask and somewhat to the memory management supertask, but it ignored certain story structure aspects which could have aided the comprehension process.

Reference-contexts: Finally, there was one field of research which focused on story structure as the key to understanding, e.g. story grammars <ref> [8] </ref>. High-level reasoning was where these systems fell short, relying too much on the story structure alone. These past systems all ignored various aspects of the total process of reading, leading to them having to work harder at the portions on which they did concentrate.

Reference-contexts: To satisfy these conflicting goals, we employ a multidimensional grid onto which all knowledge is mapped (see Figure 1). One dimension is a traditional, Schankian breakdown of knowledge <ref> [9] </ref> into action, object, agent, and state. The other is a natural breakdown according to mode of existencephysical, mental, emotional, social, and temporal. Concepts are located within a cell of the grid according to their descriptions. For example, walking is a physical action while hating is an emotional one.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the various attempts only concentrated on a portion of the problem. For example, there were systems which were syntax-driven, such as Woods' ATN systems <ref> [11] </ref>; these did not understand text at a high level of comprehension.
