Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction At the first Hakone Game Programming Workshop 1994 a report was given about GoTools, a program for investigating closed life/death positions <ref> [1] </ref>. Work done since that time included * the speed-up and clean-up of several parts of the code * an improvement of the interface * an improved tactics sub-module * further tests and debugging.
