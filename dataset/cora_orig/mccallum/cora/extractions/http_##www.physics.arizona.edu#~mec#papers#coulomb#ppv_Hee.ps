Abstract: We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on poly(para-phenylenevinylene) oligomers within a theoretical model that emphasizes long-range Coulomb interactions between the -electrons. Our goal is to arrive at self-consistent descriptions of linear optical absorption, nonlinear absorption, and triplet absorption. To this end, we conduct a thorough search in the parameter space to determine the magnitudes of the effective Coulomb interaction parameters necessary to fit all four absorption bands that are seen in the experimental absorption spectra of the poly(para-phenylenevinylenes). In addition to the Coulomb parameters themselves, we have included a screening parameter in our theoretical model that allows us to test a wide range of interaction parameters. We find best agreement between the calculated and experimental absorption spectra with Coulomb interactions that are slightly smaller than the standard Pariser-Parr-Pople parameters. For these values of the Coulomb parameters, the primary photoexcitation in poly(para-phenylenevinylene) is an exciton with binding energy close to 0.9 0.2 eV. This result, obtained from fitting the linear absorption, is in agreement with nonlinear absorption studies, viz., electroabsorption, two-photon absorption and picosecond photoinduced absorption. We have also calculated the energies of the lowest triplet state and the final state to which triplet absorption occurs. The excited triplet state reached by absorption is an exciton. This latter result, taken together with the triplet photoinduced absorption under steady state conditions, gives further support to the large exciton binding energy.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the small Stokes shift of the primary band in the absorption spectrum [11,15,16] indicates weak electron-phonon coupling and suggests the formation of polaron-excitons upon photoexcitation. More recently, picosecond pho-toinduced absorption (ps PA) [16,17], electroabsorption <ref> [16] </ref> and further photoconductivity [18] measurements have confirmed the excitonic energy spectrum of PPV. <p> Note that as with the mA g , the biexciton should also be visible in nonlinear absorption and ps PA studies. Furthermore, the experimentally determined energy locations of these two even-parity states give two independent estimates of the exciton binding energy, and establish stringent consistency requirements. Finally, our earlier <ref> [16] </ref> as well as more recent [48] calculations of PA from the 1B u suggest that the PA is stronger to the mA g than to the biexciton, and therefore the relative intensities of the two PA bands provide additional tests of the theory. VII. <p> In the present case, the calculated lowest triplet for t 0 = 2.4 eV, U = 8 eV and = 2, is at 1.4 eV, in agreement with the estimate by Leng et al. <ref> [16] </ref>. However, this agreement is somewhat fortuitious, as the quantity more relevant than the absolute energy of T is its energy difference from the 1B u , and this is certainly overestimated in our calculation. <p> A brief discussion of photoconductivity studies that supposedly find a smaller binding energy is presented following this. The mA g state has been seen in; (i) electroabsorption <ref> [16] </ref>, (ii) two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy [51], (iii) ps PA [17,52], and most recently, (iv) direct two-photon absorption [53]. Two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy [51] places the mA g in unsubstituted PPV at 2.95 eV, about 0.55 eV above the exciton, thought to be at 2.4 eV. <p> Two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy [51] places the mA g in unsubstituted PPV at 2.95 eV, about 0.55 eV above the exciton, thought to be at 2.4 eV. The location of this state in the substituted PPV derivatives remains largely unaltered, as seen from the electroabsorption spectrum of MEH-PPV <ref> [16] </ref>. Note that there is general agreement that the 1B u exciton in the substituted materials occurs at 2.1-2.2 eV, so that the occurence of the mA g at ~ 2:8 2:9 eV would be in strong agreement with our theoretical result for the exciton binding energy. <p> PA from the 1B u exciton to the A g biexciton is then expected in ps experiments. The high energy PA at 1.7 eV in unsubstituted PPV and at 1.5 eV in substituted PPV derivatives has indeed been previously explained as an transition from the exciton to the biexciton <ref> [16] </ref>. An independent estimate of the exciton binding energy can be obtained from the energy of this transition. Assuming purely one-dimensional behavior, a lower limit for the biexciton energy is 2 fi E (1B u ) B:E:, where B:E: is the binding energy of the 1B u exciton. <p> Fourth, PL and PA kinetics remains correlated in the structurally related material PPA even at long times in the nanosecond time domain [54]. Finally, the agreement between the predictions of electroabsorption <ref> [16] </ref> and two-photon absorption [53] on the one hand, and solution and fresh film PA (including the relative strengths of the low energy and high energy PA) on the other [52] is strong evidence that PA originates from the optical exciton. <p> From the calculated electronic structure for the best parameter set the exciton binding energy is large, 0:9 0:2 eV, a result strongly supported by electroabsorption <ref> [16] </ref>, two-photon absorption [51,53], ps [16,52] and cw PA [16,50] and third harmonic generation [55]. The ps PA at high energy is to the biexciton, whose behavior in the quasi-one-dimensional organics is of considerable current interest [32,47,48,56-58].

Reference-contexts: An earlier ps PA study of poly (2-methoxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (M-PPV) films had observed PA in the infrared region in addition to the more extensively discussed high energy PA (see below), but was only able to resolve a partial signature of the infrared band <ref> [17] </ref>. Very recent ps transient absorption studies of solutions and fresh films of DOO-PPV have found PA with a sharp threshold at 0.65-0.7 eV [52]. <p> First, the measurement technique of PL quantum efficiency of Yan et al. [59] itself has been criticized by Greeenham et al. [61]. Second, PA and PL dynamics are correlated in solutions [17,52], blends <ref> [17] </ref>, and fresh films [52], while PA energies are the same in all cases. It would be a remarkable coincidence for the PA to originate from the optical exciton in solutions and from polaron pairs in thin films, while still occuring at identical energies.

More recently, picosecond pho-toinduced absorption (ps PA) [16,17], electroabsorption [16] and further photoconductivity <ref> [18] </ref> measurements have confirmed the excitonic energy spectrum of PPV. <p> It is to be noted that while in the above we have focused on two-photon absorption and ps PA, a very recent third harmonic generation measurement of unsubstituted PPV places the conduction band threshold at 3:2 0:1 eV [55], in complete agreement with our earlier work <ref> [18] </ref>. The lower limit of our estimated exciton binding energy then would apply to unsubstituted PPV, with the binding energy in substituted PPV being higher by ~ 0:1 0:2 eV. In the above we have focused only on the low energy ps PA in the infrared.

Reference-contexts: We will see in section V that the deviation of transition (ii) from its central location is a direct consequence of electron-electron interactions. The shift of the central peak upon inclusion of Coulomb interactions has also been discussed by Rice and Gartstein <ref> [19] </ref>, although they reach quantitatively different conclusions about the strength of the Coulomb interactions and the exciton binding energy. In the above, we have limited our discussion to qualitative aspects only. However, quantitative aspects are also important in the present context. <p> Our estimate of this quantity is closest to those of Shimoi and Abe [31] and of Yu et al. [32]. Our results are different from those obtained by Gartstein et al., who in different publications have estimated the exciton binding energy to be as low as 0.1 eV <ref> [19] </ref> and as high as 0.3 eV [21]. Our differences from these latter authors have several origins, including their choice of effective correlation parameters and their effective Hamiltonian which neglects terms that do not conserve the number of electron-hole pairs [19-21].

Reference-contexts: For the same reason, the estimate of 0.8 eV as the binding energy of T <ref> [21] </ref> is inconsistent with the observed triplet PA at 1.4 eV. To summarize this section, the energy of the mA g in PPV derivatives is obtained from two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy, electroabsorption, ps PA and direct two-photon absorption. The measured energy is the same in all cases. <p> Our results are different from those obtained by Gartstein et al., who in different publications have estimated the exciton binding energy to be as low as 0.1 eV [19] and as high as 0.3 eV <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A recent polarized absorption study of poly (2,5-dinonyloxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (NO-PPV) <ref> [22] </ref> has confirmed the parallel polarization of the 3.7 eV band, thereby, (a) confirming the assignments in reference 26, and (b) demonstrating that the so-called polymers are in fact relatively short oligomers whose chain length distribution peaks around 8-10 unit cells. <p> Such a wavefunction analysis allows us to classify excited states into types I , Ib , II , III and IV , respectively. Elsewhere we have demonstrated theoretically [22,26] and experimentally <ref> [22] </ref> that the four absorption bands of Fig. 2 are due to absorptions to the states I , Ib , III and IV , respectively, in order of increasing energy ( Ib consists of higher d!d fl , and is identified by its larger dipole coupling to the ground state, compared <p> Such a crossing of energy levels in the real material would contradict the results of the polarization study of the absorption bands <ref> [22] </ref>. Experimentally, the absorption band at 4.7 eV is polarized nearly perpendicular to the long axis of the oligomer (y-polarized), and the absorption at 6.0 eV is polarized almost entirely along the long axis (x-polarized). Theoretically, III is y-polarized, whereas IV is x-polarized.

Reference-contexts: This aspect of their result is in agreement with the our results for t 0 = 3 eV, and is a clear demonstration that smaller t 0 and larger Coulomb interactions provide the best parameter choice. While the early work by Cornil et al. <ref> [23] </ref> did not attempt to estimate the exciton binding energy, a more recent work by Beljonne et al. on the lowest singlet and triplet absorptions in PPV has claimed that their results imply the intermediate binding energy [27].

Reference-contexts: This feature has 3 been ascribed to both a transition to an optically forbidden state that becomes weakly allowed due to the broken charge conjugation symmetry (CCS) in the substituted polymers [20,21], as well as to a "finite-size band" due to the discreteness of the energy spectrum of finite chains <ref> [26] </ref>. <p> Electron-phonon interactions therefore contribute minimally to the exciton binding energy in PPV. 6 V. CONFIGURATION INTERACTION A. First Order Configuration Interaction Before we present the details of our computational results, it is useful to understand the effects of Coulomb interactions at a qualitative level <ref> [26] </ref>. At the lowest order (first order), configuration interaction (CI) splits degenerate single-electron excitations [37]. In the present case, the electron-electron interaction H ee introduces matrix elements h d!l fl jH ee j l!d fl i [see Fig. 2], resulting in new eigenstates d!l fl l!d fl . <p> due to absorptions to the states I , Ib , III and IV , respectively, in order of increasing energy ( Ib consists of higher d!d fl , and is identified by its larger dipole coupling to the ground state, compared to neighboring states also of the type d!d fl <ref> [26] </ref>). For each set of Coulomb parameters we then compare the calculated and experimental energies of these four states. We define the n-unit oligomer to be the system consisting of n phenyl rings and n 1 vinylene units. The results we report are for calculations performed on 8-unit oligomers.

Reference-contexts: While the early work by Cornil et al.

It is not clear how this conclusion is reached, as their work does not evaluate the energy of the continuum threshold directly; neither does it attempt to give interpretations of nonlinear absorption experiments.

Reference-contexts: The appearance of the 3.7 eV band in the absorption spectrum indicates that the actual materials consist of relatively short (~ 8 10 unit) oligomers [22,26], although the longest conjugated segments may be somewhat longer <ref> [28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, precisely for this reason, such a large t 0 was rejected in the past from comparisons to benzene singlet and triplet spectra (additional reasons for rejecting such large t 0 value in the past also originated from the unusually large calculated oscillator strength of the allowed absorption in benzene <ref> [37] </ref>; however, oscillator strengths are not of concern here). <p> The inability of one-electron models to fit experiments in systems with multiple absorp tions is well known from the quantum chemistry literature, where the inclusion of explicit Coulomb interactions were shown to be crucial in attempts to model the absorption spectra of benzene and the polyacenes <ref> [37] </ref>.

First Order Configuration Interaction Before we present the details of our computational results, it is useful to understand the effects of Coulomb interactions at a qualitative level [26]. At the lowest order (first order), configuration interaction (CI) splits degenerate single-electron excitations <ref> [37] </ref>. In the present case, the electron-electron interaction H ee introduces matrix elements h d!l fl jH ee j l!d fl i [see Fig. 2], resulting in new eigenstates d!l fl l!d fl . <p> VII. TRIPLET ABSORPTION SCI is known to give too low an energy for the lowest triplet state T , relative to that of the lowest singlet excited state <ref> [37] </ref>. In the present case, the calculated lowest triplet for t 0 = 2.4 eV, U = 8 eV and = 2, is at 1.4 eV, in agreement with the estimate by Leng et al. [16].

Reference-contexts: A recent theoretical work on the lowest excitations in trans-stilbene and comparison of the excited state energies to experiment also supports this choice of t 0 <ref> [38] </ref>. With this standard t 0 , an enormous shift in energy (by about 1.2 eV) of the l!l fl transition would be required to reproduce the intense high energy optical transition at 6 eV. Such a large shift can come only from Coulomb interactions between the electrons.

Reference-contexts: We take the V ij to be long range and of the form V ij = [(1 + 0:6117R 2 (4) where R ij is the distance in Abetween carbon atoms i and j. The values U = 11:13 eV and = 1:0 correspond to the Ohno <ref> [39] </ref> form of the PPP potential. We do not, however, assign a fixed value to the Hubbard U . The constant in Eq. 4 models the dielectric constant of the medium, and determines the strength of V ij as a function of distance.

Reference-contexts: Different functional forms of V ij such as screened Mataga-Nishimoto or exponential decay with different decay constants <ref> [41] </ref> can also be used to model the screening in the solid-state material.

Reference-contexts: The results of such calculations, including the estimate for the exciton binding energy, are similar to the results of the present work <ref> [42] </ref> and will not be discussed. We now give an additional reason for ignoring electron-phonon interactions in Eq. 2. As will be shown below, the lowest optical state within Eq. 2 is an exciton. <p> Thus for = 2 and 3, values of U that reproduce the experimental energy of III yield energies for IV that are considerably larger than the experimental value of 6.0 eV <ref> [42] </ref>. Only for = 1 in Table I do we find the shift in III to be larger than that of IV as U is slowly increased.

Reference-contexts: At this stage, we make the following hypothesis. Previous work has shown that the threshold state of the electron-hole continuum band within models of the type in Eq. 3 belongs to the optically allowed B u subspace <ref> [43] </ref>, even though the transition dipole coupling between the ground state and this state can be tiny in one dimension upon exciton formation. <p> An alternate way to determine the conduction band threshold is from calculations of dipole moments and nonlinear third order optical susceptibilties [43,46]. Within both SCI theory [46] and exact finite-chain calculations <ref> [43] </ref> of the third-order optical nonlinearities of polydiacetylenes it has been demonstrated that the optical nonlinearity is primarily determined by the 1B u optical exciton, the continuum band threshold state (hereafter the nB u ), and an even-parity exciton (hereafter the mA g ) that lies between the 1B u and <p> The nB u is then an even higher B u state that also has a very large transition dipole coupling with the mA g <ref> [43] </ref>. Calculations of dipole moments then allow us to determine the nB u state here in a two-step procedure. The nB u state is also shown in Fig. 6, where it is seen to occur very close to the HF band threshold.

Reference-contexts: We therefore conclude that for = 1 there is no value of U that can simultaneously fit all four bands in the experimental absorption spectrum while maintaining the correct band assignments. The same band crossing seen in Table I has previously been seen in SCI calculations on trans-stilbene <ref> [45] </ref>. There, standard PPP Coulomb interactions caused the calculated splitting between the eigenstates of the types II and III to become large enough that III was calculated to have a higher energy than IV .

Reference-contexts: With the large exciton binding energies calculated here, one expects stable biexcitons, especially with the one dimensional confinement in these systems [16,47,48]. Calculations of biexcitons necessarily require multiple electron excitations (i.e. higher order CI), and currently exist only for linear chains <ref> [48] </ref>. However, a lower limit for the energy of the lowest biexciton is easily estimated for one dimensional systems. <p> Furthermore, the experimentally determined energy locations of these two even-parity states give two independent estimates of the exciton binding energy, and establish stringent consistency requirements. Finally, our earlier [16] as well as more recent <ref> [48] </ref> calculations of PA from the 1B u suggest that the PA is stronger to the mA g than to the biexciton, and therefore the relative intensities of the two PA bands provide additional tests of the theory.

Reference-contexts: Within the SCI approximation T fl is degenerate with the mA g (see also reference 45). Recent exact finite chain calculations for the linear polyene structure have shown that higher order CI lowers the energy of T fl relative to that of the mA g for arbitrary Coulomb interactions <ref> [49] </ref>. Thus T fl occurs below the nB u , and is also an exciton. <p> Indeed, in the case of the linear chain and the extended Hubbard model with only nearest neighbor intersite Coulomb interaction, the energy of T fl converges with that of the 1B u in the infinite chain limit <ref> [49] </ref>. With long range intersite Coulomb interactions, it is difficult to precisely determine the energy of T fl in the infinite chain limit, but in all cases it occurs below the mA g .

Reference-contexts: Very recent ps transient absorption studies of solutions and fresh films of DOO-PPV have found PA with a sharp threshold at 0.65-0.7 eV <ref> [52] </ref>.

It is conceivable that the absence of PL at long times in thin films of PPV derivatives is due to the trapping of excitons at defect sites, but further investigation will be necessary to clarify this issue.

Reference-contexts: It is to be noted that while in the above we have focused on two-photon absorption and ps PA, a very recent third harmonic generation measurement of unsubstituted PPV places the conduction band threshold at 3:2 0:1 eV <ref> [55] </ref>, in complete agreement with our earlier work [18]. The lower limit of our estimated exciton binding energy then would apply to unsubstituted PPV, with the binding energy in substituted PPV being higher by ~ 0:1 0:2 eV. <p> All three estimates are in agreement with our estimate obtained from the analysis of the linear absorption. We believe that it is significant that our energy range overlaps with that of Mathy et al. <ref> [55] </ref>, who performed a different 14 nonlinear absorption experiment from the ones discussed here. The optical experiments completely rule out estimates of 0.1 - 0.2 eV or less for the exciton binding energy, and even the intermediate estimate of 0.4 eV appears to be very doubtful. <p> From the calculated electronic structure for the best parameter set the exciton binding energy is large, 0:9 0:2 eV, a result strongly supported by electroabsorption [16], two-photon absorption [51,53], ps [16,52] and cw PA [16,50] and third harmonic generation <ref> [55] </ref>. The ps PA at high energy is to the biexciton, whose behavior in the quasi-one-dimensional organics is of considerable current interest [32,47,48,56-58].

Reference-contexts: Theoretically, an exciton binding energy as large as determined here would also indicate that stable biexcitons [47,48,56-58], or bound states of two excitons, would occur in PPV. The stability of the biexciton state is particularly enhanced in one-dimension because of confinement effects <ref> [56] </ref>. PA from the 1B u exciton to the A g biexciton is then expected in ps experiments.
