Title: INTELLIGENT VOICE SMOOTHER FOR SILENCE-SUPPRESSED VOICE OVER INTERNET: THEORY AND PRACTICE

Abstract: For transporting voice data with silence suppression over the Internet, the problem of jitter introduced from the network often renders the speech unintelligible. It is thus essential to offer intramedia synchronization to remove jitter while retaining minimal playout delay. We have previously proposed a neural network-based intra-voice synchronization mechanism, called Intelligent Voice Smoother (IVoS). IVoS is aimed to furnish CBR playout during talkspurts assuring minimal mean and variance of Distortion of Talkspurts (DOT) and mean playout Delay (PD). To substantiate the viability of IVoS, in this paper we present a prototyping system. The prototyping system is composed of the Silence Suppressor and Traffic Simulator modules at the sending host, an IVoS module at the receiving host, and a stand-alone Ethernet connecting the two hosts. The Silence Suppressor module caries out silence suppression based on two thresholds. The Traffic Simulator module is responsible for the creation of delay and jitter. The IVoS module simply performs major IVoS functions. The prototyping results reveal that, compared to existing playout approaches, IVoS achieves superior playout yielding negligible DOT and PD irrespective of traffic variation.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Recent evolution in high-speed communication technology enables the development of distributed multimedia applications combining a variety of media data, such as text, audio, graphics, images, voice, and full-motion video. These applications often require stringent Quality Of Service (QOS) guarantees, such as bounded delay and jitter <ref> [1] </ref>. Moreover, the Multicast Backbone (MBone)/Internet [2,3] has been widely deployed to support diverse multicasting traffic for businesses and individuals. However, its current transport protocols were originally designed to offer the fibest effort service without performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Finally, conclusion remarks are given in Section 5. 2. Intelligent Voice Smoother (IVoS) - An Overview 2.1 Concept Generally, voice data are sampled and encoded as fixed-size frames. These frames with silence suppression are in turn sent over the MBONE/Internet <ref> [2] </ref>. Upon receiving frames which are assumed to arrive in accordance with a generic Markov Modulated Bernoulli Process (MMBP) (described later) with unknown probabilistic parameters, IVoS determines the departure time at which frames are transferred from the IVoS Smoother Buffer to the decoder buffer from which frames are playbacked.

Reference-contexts: However, its current transport protocols were originally designed to offer the fibest effort service without performance guarantees. Consequently, the proliferation of these multimedia applications has imposed ever more strain on the MBone/Internet. In particular, for transporting voice with silence suppression <ref> [4] </ref>, the problem of unbounded jitter often renders the speech unintelligible. It is thus indispensable to offer ______________________________________________ The work was sponsored by MOEA and supported in part by the Institute for Information Industry (III) under Contract C87140. intramedia synchronization to remove jitter while retaining minimal playout delay. <p> Moreover, during the busy state, one frame always arrives (with probability =1) per slot time, and no frame is generated during the idle and the pause states. It is worth noting that, differing from the Interrupted Deterministic Process (IDP) <ref> [4] </ref> which is often used for modelling voice source traffic, this MMBP is used to model the traffic which has been multiplexed and demultiplexed over a network with jitter.

Reference-contexts: Several existing intramedia synchronization methods, which perform at end systems, exhibit various performance merits. They can be categorized as: static delay-based, dynamic feedback-based, and dynamic delay-based. Static delay-based methods preserve playout continuity by buffering massive packets at receiving end systems <ref> [7] </ref> or delaying the playout time of the first packet received [3,8]. These methods have been shown to be feasible but at the expense of a drastic increase in playout delay.

Reference-contexts: It is based on an Interrupted Bernoulli Process (IBP) <ref> [10] </ref>, which has been widely accepted to model bursty traffic. The process alternates between the busy state, during which the first frame in the queue is sent, and the idle state during which no frame is sent.

Reference-contexts: These methods have been shown to be viable particularly for video streams which are much dissimilar to voice streams by nature <ref> [12] </ref>. Two other dynamic delay-based methods [13,14] attempted to preserve playout continuity via adaptive buffering of frames having been time-stamped at sources. The methods are indeed feasible but at the expense of drastic processing and framing overhead from frequent time stamping.

Reference-contexts: The methods are indeed feasible but at the expense of drastic processing and framing overhead from frequent time stamping. We have previously proposed a neural-network-based intra-voice synchronization mechanism, called Intelligent Voice Smoother (IVoS) <ref> [15] </ref>, operating at the application layer of receiving end systems. IVoS is composed of three components: Smoother Buffer, Neural Network (NN) Traffic Predictor, and Constant Bit Rate (CBR) Enforcer. Newly arriving frames are queued in the Smoother Buffer. <p> The same process repeats for the next talkspurt until the end of the talk. For other details and simulation results, readers are suggested to refer our early published paper <ref> [15] </ref>. 3. Prototyping System To demonstrate the viability of IVoS, we implemented a prototyping system in Pentium Pro 200 Personal Computers (PCs) operating under Windows95.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noticing that, we do not consider frame loss probability, namely the dropping of frames due to late arrival. Although discard of late frames assures delay-free playout, the price paid is deteriorating speech clipping <ref> [16] </ref>. 2.2 Inbound Traffic Model The inbound traffic to IVoS is modelled by a generic discrete-time MMBP [4,17], as shown in Figure 1. The process alternates between the pause state and the talkspurt state.

Reference-contexts: In contrary, the modeling of the pause state in the simulated IVoS system described previously is incorporated within the MMBP model. IVoS: The IVoS module in the prototyping system is comprised of three submodules (Smoother Buffer, Traffic Predictor, and CBR Enforcer) implemented by threads <ref> [18] </ref>. Their major functions were previously described and are omitted here. 4. Experimental Results With the prototyping system, we carried out experiments and drew performance comparisons between IVoS and four other playout approaches. They are perfect playout, instant playout, 15-slot (small) constant delay playout, and 80-slot (large) constant delay playout.
