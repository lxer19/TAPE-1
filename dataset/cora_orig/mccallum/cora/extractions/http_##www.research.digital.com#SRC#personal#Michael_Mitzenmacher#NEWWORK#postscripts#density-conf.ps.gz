Title: Load Balancing and Density Dependent Jump Markov Processes EXTENDED ABSTRACT

Abstract: We provide a new approach for analyzing both static and dynamic randomized load balancing strategies. We demonstrate the approach by providing the first analysis of the following model: customers arrive as a Poisson stream of rate n, &lt; 1, at a collection of n servers. Each customer chooses some constant d servers independently and uniformly at random from the n servers, and waits for service at the one with the fewest customers. Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol, and the service time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean 1. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves, and in particular we are interested the expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. The model provides a good abstraction of a simple, efficient load balancing scheme in the setting where jobs arrive at a large system of parallel processors. This model appears more realistic than similar models studied previously, in that it is both dynamic and open: that is, customers arrive over time, and the number of customers is not fixed. Our approach consists of two distinct stages: we first develop a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n ! 1, and then show how to translate results from this model to results for large, but finite, values of n. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own right. This methodology proves effective for studying a number of similar problems, and simulations demonstrate that the method accurately predicts system behavior even for relatively small systems.

Reference-contexts: That this infinite set of differential equations has a unique solution given appropriate initial conditions is not immediately obvious; however, it follows from standard results in analysis (see <ref> [1, p.188, Theorem 4.1.5] </ref> or [11, Theorem 3.2]). It should be intuitively clear that as n ! 1 the behavior of the supermarket system approaches that of this deterministic system; this is justified by Kurtz's theorem, which is explained in Section 3. <p> Recall that T 1 () = 1=(1 ) from standard queueing theory. Analysis of the summation in Corollary 8, which we omit in this extended abstract, reveals the following: Theorem 9 For 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and d 2, T d () c d (log T 1 ()) for some constant c d dependent only on d.

Reference-contexts: When d &gt; 1, analysis proves difficult because the sizes of the various queues are dependent. A great deal of work has been done to analyze the variant where the customer selects the shortest queue (for example, see <ref> [2, 10, 25] </ref> for references); for more than two queues, only approximations or asymptotic expressions are known. The supermarket model has been studied by Eager et al. [12] and Zhou [31].

Reference-contexts: One can also show that Y cn is close to its mean with high probability using standard martingale arguments and the method of bounded differences, which we do here. We assume familiarity with basic martingale theory; see, for example, <ref> [4, Chapter 7] </ref>. We use the following form of the martingale tail inequality due to Azuma [8]: Lemma 14 [Azuma] Let X 0 ; X 1 ; : : : X m be a martingale sequence such that for each k, jX k X k1 j 1.

Reference-contexts: A less realistic dynamic model was successfully analyzed by Azar et al. [7], and a dynamic edge orientation problem related to load balancing was analyzed by Ajtai et al. in <ref> [5] </ref>. We note that our method can also be applied to these dynamic models and to the static model of [7], providing new insight and results. Previously these problems have all been attacked by applying complicated arguments based on Chernoff-type bounds. <p> Threshold systems: Customers choose one server randomly, and stay there if the queue has at most T customers; otherwise, they proceed to another randomly selected queue. 4. Closed systems: Customers, after completing service, are recirculated through the system. 5. Edge orientation problem <ref> [5] </ref>: This problem is set on a complete graph of n vertices. The weight of a vertex is the difference between its indegree and outdegree. At each time step a random edge arrives and is directed toward the adjacent vertex with smaller weight.

Reference-contexts: The comparison argument is entirely similar to those in [29, 30], which show that choosing the shortest queue is optimal subject to certain assumptions on the service process; alternatively, an argument based on majorization, such as that in <ref> [6] </ref>, is possible. A similar argument also shows that the size of the longest queue in a supermarket system of size n is stochastically dominated by the size of the longest queue in a set of n independent M/M/1 servers. <p> Similarly, choosing d = 3 one expects a maximum load of three until billions of balls have been thrown. These results match simulation results presented in [3] and <ref> [6] </ref>. We also present the averages from one hundred simulations of one million balls, which further demonstrate the accuracy of this technique. This accuracy is a marked advantage of this approach; previous techniques have not provided ways of concretely predicting actual performance.

Reference-contexts: The supermarket model proves difficult to analyze because of dependencies: knowing the length of one queue affects the distribution of the length of all the other queues. The supermarket model can be seen as a generalization of the static model studied by Azar et al. <ref> [7] </ref>, in which there are a fixed number of customers to be distributed who never leave the system. They also analyze a different closed dynamic model, where the number of customers remains fixed over all time, and a customer who completes service is recirculated in the system. <p> We note that an analysis of the more realistic open dynamic model, the supermarket model, has remained open. As described in <ref> [7] </ref>, models of this kind have a number of applications to computing problems, including resource allocation, hashing, and on-line load balancing. Our results apply to dynamic variations of these applications. <p> They analyzed a static case, where a number of customers are to be permanently distributed among a fixed number of servers. The static problem was further developed and analyzed by Azar et al. in <ref> [7] </ref>, and results for other static settings are given by MacKenzie et al. [24] and Adler et al. [3].

In this setting, initially there are n balls and n bins. Balls arrive sequentially. Upon arrival, each ball chooses d bins independently and uniformly at random (with replacement), and is then placed in the least loaded of these bins (ties being broken arbitrarily).

Reference-contexts: In this respect, the static problem is easier than the corresponding dynamic problem. 4 One could also attempt to solve the differential equation for y in terms of t. Standard integral tables <ref> [9] </ref> give such equations when d = 2; 3 and 4. We may further conclude from the details of the proof of Kurtz's theorem that with high probability, jY cn =n y c j is O ( log n=n).

The result then follows from <ref> [11, pp. 70-74] </ref>. We now show that the s i decrease doubly exponentially (in the infinite model). Let j be the smallest value such that s j (0) = 0, which exists by the hypothesis of the theorem. Then M (0) [1= j1 ] 1=d j1 &lt; 1= 1=(d1) .

Reference-contexts: As we describe in Section 2.3, for close to 1 there is an exponential improvement in the expected time a customer spends in the system. 1.1 Previous work The power of using two hash functions for load balancing was demonstrated by Karp, Luby, and Meyer auf der Heide <ref> [16] </ref> in an application to PRAM simulation. They analyzed a static case, where a number of customers are to be permanently distributed among a fixed number of servers. <p> Upon arrival, each ball chooses d bins independently and uniformly at random (with replacement), and is then placed in the least loaded of these bins (ties being broken arbitrarily). With high probability, the maximum load is log log n= log d + O (1). (Similar results also appeared in <ref> [16] </ref>.) We first consider the following simple question: how many bins remain empty after the protocol GREEDY (d) terminates? The question can also be seen as a matching problem: given a bipartite graph with n vertices on each side such that each vertex on the left has d edges to vertices

Reference-contexts: 1 can be proven by a simple comparison argument against the system in which each customer queues at a random server (that is, where d = 1); in this system, each server acts like an M/M/1 server with arrival rate , which is known to be stable (see, for example, <ref> [19] </ref>). The comparison argument is entirely similar to those in [29, 30], which show that choosing the shortest queue is optimal subject to certain assumptions on the service process; alternatively, an argument based on majorization, such as that in [6], is possible.

Reference-contexts: Kurtz's work has previously been applied to matching problems on random graphs [14, 17, 18] as well as some queueing models <ref> [28] </ref>; here, we apply it for the first time to load balancing problems. Given the increasing use of Markov chains in the analysis of algorithms, we believe that this technique may be more widely applicable than previously expected.

Reference-contexts: The comparison argument is entirely similar to those in <ref> [29, 30] </ref>, which show that choosing the shortest queue is optimal subject to certain assumptions on the service process; alternatively, an argument based on majorization, such as that in [6], is possible.

Reference-contexts: The supermarket model has been studied by Eager et al. [12] and Zhou <ref> [31] </ref>. In fact, Eager et al. also use an approach based on Markov chains for their analysis; however, the authors make the crucial assumption that the state of each queue is stochastically independent of the state of any other queue [12, p. 665].
