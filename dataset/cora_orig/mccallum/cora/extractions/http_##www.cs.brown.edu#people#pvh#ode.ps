Abstract: This paper studies the application of interval analysis and consistency techniques to ordinary differential equations. It presents a unifying framework to extend traditional numerical techniques to intervals. In particular, it shows how to extend explicit and implicit, one-step and multi-step, methods to intervals. The paper also took a fresh look at the traditional problems encountered by interval techniques and studied how consistency techniques may help. It proposes to generalize interval techniques into a two-step process: a forward process that computes an enclosure and a backward process that reduces this enclosures. In addition, the paper studies how consistency techniques may help in improving the forward process and the wrapping effect.

Reference-contexts: In general, these methods do not guarantee the existence of a solution within a given bound and may suffer from traditional numerical problems of floating-point systems. Interval Analysis in ODE Interval techniques for ODE systems were introduced by Moore [Moo66].

These methods provide numerically reliable enclosures of the exact solution at points t 0 ; t 1 ; : : : ; t m .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 6 can be used for proving existence and uniqueness of a solution and for providing a bounding box <ref> [Loh87, Cor95] </ref>. A typical algorithm starts from an approximation B 0 = D 0 and applies Picard operator. If (B 0 ) 6 B, the algorithm widens B 0 into B 1 (e.g., by doubling its size) and iterates the process.

The set of solution values is a rotated rectangle.

As a consequence, s (t j ; D j ; t j+1 ) can be computed by considering the frontier of D j only. 3 The Generic Algorithm The interval methods described in this paper can be viewed as instantiations of a generic algorithm.

Reference-contexts: To remedy this limitation, more advanced techniques (see, for instance, <ref> [Loh87, Ste71, DS76] </ref>) have been proposed but they are all bound to a specific step procedure.

Reference-contexts: The new techniques proposed in this paper should be viewed as defining an experimental agenda to be carried out in the coming years. The techniques are reasonably simple mathematically and algorithmically and were motivated by the same intuitions as the techniques at the core of the Numerica system <ref> [VHLD97] </ref>. In this respect, they should complement well existing methods. But, as it was the case for Numerica, only extensive experimental evaluation will determine which combinations of these techniques is useful in practice and which application areas they are best suited for. Very preliminary experimental results illustrate the potential benefits.

Reference-contexts: The search can also be restricted to the frontier by adding the redundant constraint _ left (I i ) = left (K i ) _ right (I i ) = right (K i ) and applying techniques such as constructive disjunction <ref> [VHSDar] </ref>. Note that combining these two necessary conditions require some extra care to preserve correctness. 6 Backwards Pruning: Box-Consistency for ODE This section proposes another technique to address the growth of intervals in the step methods. The fundamental intuition here is illustrated in Figure 3.
