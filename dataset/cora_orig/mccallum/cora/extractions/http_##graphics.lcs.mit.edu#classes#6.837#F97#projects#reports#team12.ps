Abstract: We have constructed a 3D model of the Dome of the Rock, an Islamic religious structure built in Jerusalem in the 7th century. The structure is built around the tip of the Temple Mount, the "Rock" of the building's name, which holds great religious signifigance and is the subject of several Muslim myths. The structure itself is an octagon enclosing another octagon of columns enclosing a circle of columns, which is the smallest enclosing circle of the rock. Our model captures not only the unique geometry of the structure, but also its interesting textures, as most of the inside of the Dome of the Rock is covered with mosaics and generously interspersed with marble. Given the information available to us, we made a model reconstructing as closely as possible the 7th century appearence of the building.
