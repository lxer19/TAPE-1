Title: On Bounding the Betti Numbers and Computing the Euler Characteristic of Semi-algebraic Sets

Abstract: In this paper we give a new bound on the sum of the Betti numbers of closed semi-algebraic sets. This extends a well-known bound due to Oleinik and Petrovsky [28], Thom [35] and Milnor [27]. In separate papers they proved that the sum of the Betti numbers of a semi-algebraic set S R k ; defined by P 1 0; : : : ; P s 0; deg(P i ) d; 1 i s; is bounded by (O(sd)) k : Given a closed semi-algebraic set S R k defined as the intersection of a real variety, Q = 0; deg(Q) d; whose real dimension is k 0 ; with a set defined by a quantifier-free Boolean formula with no negations with atoms of the form, P i = 0; P i 0; P i 0; deg(P i ) d; 1 i s; we prove that the sum of the Betti numbers of S is bounded by s k 0 (O(d)) k : Additionally, when S is defined by Q = 0; P 1 &gt; 0; : : : ; P s &gt; 0; we have a slightly tighter bound of (O(d)) k : This result generalizes the Oleinik-Petrovsky-Thom-Milnor bound in two directions. Firstly, our bound applies to arbitrary unions of basic closed semi-algebraic sets, not just for basic semi-algebraic sets. Secondly, the combinatorial part (the part depending on s) in our bound, depends on the dimension of the variety rather than that of the ambient space. It also generalizes a result in [5] where a similar bound is proven for the number of connected components. We also investigate the case where the algebraic complexity of the input polynomials is measured in terms of the number of mono fl Currently at the Mathematical Sciences Department, IBM T.J.

Reference-contexts: Collin's algorithm for computing a cylindrical algebraic decomposition [9], gives sufficient topological information for computing the Euler characteristic, and in fact the homology groups of a given semi-algebraic set <ref> [34] </ref>. However, this algorithm has double exponential complexity (sd) 2 O (k) : Previ ously, this was the best algorithm for computing the Euler characteristic of 4 general semi-algebraic sets. A single exponential algorithm for computing the Euler characteristic of a smooth algebraic hypersurface is mentioned in [31].

Reference-contexts: semi-algebraic set defined by, P 1 0; : : : ; P s 0; with deg (P i ) d; there is a tighter bound of (O (sd)) k on the sum of the Betti numbers of S: This was proved in separate papers by Oleinik and Petrovsky [28], Thom <ref> [35] </ref> and Milnor [27]. (Note that this includes the case when S is the real zeros of a set of polynomials.) This bound plays an important role in algorithmic real algebraic geometry [22], and has been used recently in proving lower bounds in the algebraic computation tree model (see [36], [29]).

Reference-contexts: Thom [35] and Milnor [27]. (Note that this includes the case when S is the real zeros of a set of polynomials.) This bound plays an important role in algorithmic real algebraic geometry [22], and has been used recently in proving lower bounds in the algebraic computation tree model (see <ref> [36] </ref>, [29]). <p> A difficulty in extending this bound to an arbitrary semi-algebraic set defined by the polynomials P; lies in the fact that the Betti numbers of the 2 union of two disjoint sets, can be arbitrarily greater than the sum of the individual Betti numbers of the two sets (see <ref> [36] </ref> for an easy example). We extend the same bound to arbitrary unions of basic closed semi-algebraic sets. <p> G m;n (the space of m dimensional subspaces of R n ), embedded as a m (n m) dimensional variety in R n 2 : Remark 1: We note that a bound of (O (sd)) 2k on the sum of the Betti numbers can be deduced from Theorem 1 in <ref> [36] </ref> or from Theorem 1.10 in [29]. Remark 2: Even though we state our results for closed semi-algebraic sets over the reals the same bounds hold over any real closed fields through 3 the application of well-known transfer principles. <p> We utilize several results from <ref> [36] </ref>. We assume that the reader is familiar with algebraic decision trees ([36]). <p> For any set A; following <ref> [36] </ref>, we define fi 0 i (A) to be the rank of the i-th homology group H i ( A; @A); where A is the closure of A in the topology of R k and @A = A A: Similarly we define, 0 (A) = P i (A): If A is <p> some polynomial f 2 R [X 1 ; : : : ; X k ]; let A = X " (f 0); and B = X A: Then, 0 (X) = 0 (A) + 0 (B): 21 Proof: The proof is quite similar to the proof of lemma 5 in <ref> [36] </ref>. <p> [ @X; @X) ! H i ( X; @X) ! H i ( X; A [ @X) ! ; we have ( X; @X) = ( X; A [ @X) + ( A [ @X; @X): Moreover, fi i ( X; A [ @X) = fi 0 i (A) (see <ref> [36] </ref> for a proof). <p> omit the details. 2 We next prove that, following the notation introduced in the algorithm, that fi 0 i (S j ) = fi i (U j ; V j ); and thus 0 (S j ) = (U j ; V j ): The proof of this appears in <ref> [36] </ref> (page 621) and is omitted.
