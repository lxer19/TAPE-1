Abstract: ATM interconnection of computers and supercomputers offers exciting prospects for building both LAN's and WAN's because of the expected economies of scale, wide penetration of ATM, and future scalability to higher bandwidths. The BATMAN ATM trial was developed in Boulder, Colorado by US West to determine the feasibility of ATM for computing applications. In this paper we describe the BATMAN trial and report performance measurements of three types: communication between workstations, communication, between supercomputers and access rates from computers to mass storage. In each case we find that the ATM WAN provided an efficient and effective transport mechanism, and limiting bandwidth effects are invariably within the computers and mass storage systems.
