Abstract: The parsing component of previous principle-based machine translation systems are inefficient since they tend to adopt a generate-and-test paradigm. We combine the benefits of a message-passing paradigm with the benefits of a parametric approach in the implementation of a parser that avoids overgeneration and is easily ported to multiple languages. The algorithm has been implemented in C++ and successfully tested on well-known, translationally divergent sentences in a MT system called PRINCITRAN.

Reference-contexts: One of the drawbacks to alternative GB-based parsing approaches is that they generally adopt a filter-based paradigm, generating all possible candidate structures of the sentence that satisfy X theory, and then subsequently applying filters to eliminate those structures that violate GB principles. (See, for example, Abney <ref> (1989) </ref>, Correa (1991), Dorr (1991), Fong (1991), and Frank 1990.) The current approach provides an alternative to filter-based designs which avoids these difficulties by applying principles to descriptions of structures without actually building the structures themselves. In effect, structure building is deferred until the descriptions satisfy all principles.

Reference-contexts: combine the benefits of the message-passing paradigm with the benefits of the parameterized approach to build a more efficient, but easily extensible system, called PRINCITRAN. 1 Our work extends that of Lin and Goebel (1993) and Lin (1993) in that it provides a parameterization mechanism along the lines of Dorr <ref> (1993b) </ref> that allows the system to be ported to languages other than English. We focus particularly on the problem of processing head-final languages such as Korean. The algorithm has been implemented in C++ and successfully tested on well-known, translationally divergent sentences. <p> In this particular network, all phrasal heads precede their complements. However, in a head-final language such as Korean, the reverse order is required. In order to capture this distinction, we incorporate the parameterization approach of Dorr <ref> (1993b) </ref> into the message-passing framework so that the grammar network can be automatically precompiled on a per-language basis. <p> NP (left) Vbar: PP (left), ADV (left) Nbar: AP (left), PP (+gen) (left), CP (left) Abar: ADV (left) Trace Barriers only one crossing permitted more than one crossing permitted Case Case Assignment Nominative: tensed Infl; Accusative: transitive V Nominative: tensed Infl, IP predication; Accusative: transitive V are drawn from Dorr <ref> (1993b) </ref>. The same paradigm was followed in our analysis of Korean param <p>- eters. The remainder of this paper will focus on how we automatically precompile the English and Korean parameter settings concerning X theory into the grammar network (i.e., Basic Categories, Pre-terminals, Constituent Order, Specifiers, and Adjunction). 4. <p> We adopt the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) of Dorr's work and use a parameter-setting approach to account for the divergences presented in the last section. (Dorr <ref> (1993b) </ref> describes a parametric approach to mapping between the interlingua and the syntactic structure.) A preliminary investigation has indicated that the message-passing paradigm is useful for generation as well as parsing, thus providing a suitable framework for bidirectional translation.
