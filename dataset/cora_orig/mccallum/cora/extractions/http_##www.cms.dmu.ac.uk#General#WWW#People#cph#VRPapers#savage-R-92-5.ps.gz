Abstract: We present a method for isolated word speech recognition combining Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Multi Section Vector Quantization (MSVQ) Code Books techniques. The use of these two techniques together enables the system to correct half of the wrong decisions made when only one technique is used. This system was implemented on a digital signal microprocessor (DSP), and is operating in real time. This system will be used in a Virtual Reality environment. In the first part of the report we make an overview of the MSVQ and the HMM techniques. Then we describe the system components. At the end we report the results obtained. In recent years Vector Quantization (VQ) techniques have been used for data compression. Speech coding using VQ is based on linear prediction coding (LPC). The vector quantizer is a set of LPC vectors that represents the shape of the signals to be encoded. The LPC parameters used are the inverse fil ter gain squared 2 and the linear predictive coefficients A i ; i = 1; :::; M; with A 0 =1. They represent an autoregressive model and they are called codewords. These parameters represent the all pole filter speech production model (see Fig. 1). The collection of code-words is called a code book. Each frame S j of the voice signal to be encoded is compared with each of the LPC stored vectors C i , and the spectrum shape is coded by identifying the LPC vector C b that best represents S j according to some distortion measure d. ting a reproduction index instead of transmitting the entire frame. The vector quan-tizer is designed using a long training sequence of data that represents all of the speech to be coded. For isolated word recognition we used a MSVQ [1]. Each word of the recognition vocabulary is represented by d(S j ; C b ) = min(d(S j ; C i )); (1)
