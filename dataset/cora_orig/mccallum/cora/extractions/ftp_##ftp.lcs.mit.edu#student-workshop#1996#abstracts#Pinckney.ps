Reference-contexts: This style of kernel allows ExOS to abstract a machine's resources in an applications specific manner, yet prevents buggy or malicious applications from harming each other. We call kernels that are written this way exokernels <ref> [1] </ref>. Traditional Unix kernels function as a safe central site to keep state and to make global resource scheduling decisions. ExOS Supervised by M. Frans Kaashoek. Supported by ARPA contract N00014-94-1-0985 and by a NSF National Young Invesitgator Award. has no equivalent place since every application has it's own library.

Reference-contexts: Clustered page tables were proposed by Talluri et al, who could only study their benefit in simulation as the complexity of the solaris kernel prevented an actual implementation. Finally, the third version adds paging to disk or over a network. <ref> [2] </ref> The speed of ExOS is very good. Figure 1 lists several micro-benchmarks comparing ExOS running on an exokernel to Ul-trix 4.2, a stable well-tuned Unix.
