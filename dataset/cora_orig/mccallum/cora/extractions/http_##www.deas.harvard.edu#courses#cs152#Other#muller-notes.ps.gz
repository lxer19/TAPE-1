Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we briefly take up the question of recursively defined domains showing that P ! (i.e., the powerset of natural numbers ordered by subset inclusion) serves as a universal domain. Our primary reference is [Sch86] Chs. 3 and 6 but [Sto77, Hen88] and <ref> [Bar84] </ref> will also be useful. 1 2 The Theory of Fixpoints We assume known elementary properties of set theory. <p> Then f (x) = f ( fd v x j d 2 Compact (D 1 )g = ff (d) j d 2 Compact (D 1 ); d v xg: ( (See <ref> [Bar84] </ref>, p. 17). 2 Thus, continuous functions over algebraic cpos are determined by their values on compact elements. We now turn our attention to the particular algebraic cpo P !. Recall that the compact elements of P ! are the finite sets.

The student is referred to <ref> [Sch86] </ref> Ch. 11 for a more in depth discussion of reflexive domains. 4 Summary We have developed the basics of domain theory which underlies the Scott-Strachey approach to programming language theory.
