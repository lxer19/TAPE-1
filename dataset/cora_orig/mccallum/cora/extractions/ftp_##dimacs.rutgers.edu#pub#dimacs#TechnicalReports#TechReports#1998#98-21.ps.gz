I have had many stimulating discussions with him. This note actually answers a question he raised while discussing the results of <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An embedding conjecture of Bollobas and Komlos states that any n vertex graph whose minimum degree exceeds (1 1 k )n + fln contains all k chromatic, bounded degree graphs which do not expand. The precise statement is as follows: Conjecture 1.1 (Bollobas-Komlos <ref> [2] </ref>) For every k; 0 and fl &gt; 0 there is an ff = ff (k; 0 ; fl) &gt; 0 such that the following statement holds: If G is any graph with ffi (G) 1 k n + fln; then G contains as subgraphs all graphs, H; satisfying (H) k;
