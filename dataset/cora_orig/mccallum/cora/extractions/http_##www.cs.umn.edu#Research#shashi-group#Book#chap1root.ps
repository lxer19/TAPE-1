Title: Chapter 1 Introduction to spatial databases  
Abstract: A spatial database management system(SDBMS) aims at the effective and efficient management of data related to a space such as the physical world (geography, urban planning, astronomy); parts of living organisms (anatomy of the human body); engineering design (very large scale integrated circuits, the design of an automobile or the molecular structure of a pharmaceutical drug); and conceptual information space (a multi-dimensional decision support system, fluid flow, or an electro-magnetic field). Traditional database technology has been evolving for the last thirty years, largely motivated by business and administrative applications. In such applications the common data types encountered are integer, float, character, monetary-unit and date. This limited set of datatypes makes the modeling of real-world spatial applications extremely difficult. For the management of spatial data, the consensus is that four new datatypes, point, line, polygon and raster, must be incorporated into the database management system. Each datatype is accompanied by a set of operations which act upon it. For example, common operations associated with the integer and character data type are addition and concatenation, respectively. The operations associated with spatial datatypes depend on the application at hand, and ultimately upon the underlying model of space. A lot of research effort has been directed towards establishing a small but rich set of spatial operations which have wide applicability. The introduction of new data types has had a profound effect on the design of the core functionality provided by all DBMS.

Reference-contexts: The spaghetti-ring and DCEL focus on the topological concepts. The representation of the field data model includes a regular tessellation (triangular, square, hexagonal grid), as well as triangular irregular networks (TIN). The spatial queries <ref> [Chrisman, 1997] </ref> shown in Table 1.1 are often processed using filter and refine techniques. Approximate geometry such as the minimal orthogonal bounding rectangle of an extended spatial object is first used to quickly filter out many irrelevant objects.

Reference-contexts: Much work has been done over the last decade on the design of spatial data types, and consensus is slowly emerging via standardization efforts like OGIS <ref> [Gardels, 1997] </ref>. Figure 1.7 illustrates the spatial data-type hierarchy of OGIS which consists of points, curves and surfaces. The spatial data types and operations can be embedded in an object-relational query language to implement a spatial query language. 1.3.

Reference-contexts: Representative indices for extended objects include the R-tree family, the Field tree, Cell tree, BSP tree, and Balanced and Nested grid files. Concurrency control for spatial access methods <ref> [Kornacker and D.Banks, 1995] </ref> is provided by the R-link tree, which is a variant of the R-tree with additional sibling pointers that allow the tracking of modifications. Concurrency is provided during operations such as search, insert, and delete.

Reference-contexts: The other advantage of the relational model is that there is a powerful, declarative and widely used language associated with it: SQL. The commercial success and wide acceptance of the relational DBMS stems from two ambitious database system implementation projects: System/R at the IBM San Jose Research center <ref> [M.M. Astrahan., 1976] </ref> and INGRES at UC Berkeley [Stonebraker et al., 1976]. Both of these projects were critical in pushing the relational model to an industrial grade of performance and reliability. In the early 1980s, IBM developed commercial relational database products called SQL/DS.

Reference-contexts: Classical one-dimensional indices such as the B + tree can be used for spatial data by linearizing a multi-dimensional space using a space-filling curve such as the Z-order (see Figure 1.8). A large number of spatial indices <ref> [Samet, 1990] </ref> have been explored for multi-dimensional euclidean space. Representative indices for point objects include Grid files, Point-Quad-Trees, 14 CHAPTER 1.

Reference-contexts: Sequence Spaghetti Data Model Spatial Data Metric clustering techniques use the notion of distance to group nearest neighbors together in a metric space. Topological clustering methods like connectivity-clustered access methods <ref> [Shekhar and Liu, 1997] </ref> use the min-cut partitioning of a graph representation to efficiently support graph traversal operations. The physical organization of files can be supplemented with indices, which are data-structures used to improve the performance of search operations.
