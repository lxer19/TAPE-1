Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of the structure of spherical viruses at high resolution (5 to 10 A) requires automatic identification of virus particles in electron micrographs. Existing methods are extremely sensitive to noise from various sources present in micrographs and the results reported are only modestly successful. In this paper we introduce the Crosspoint Method, a set of new algorithms and heuristics, and present a graphics package which supports both manual and automatic virus particle identification. The success rate of the Crosspoint Method is higher, there are considerably fewer false hits, and the running time is better than that of previously reported attempts.

Reference-contexts: The processing of a cluster ends when the stack becomes empty. The horizontal scanning of the binary array then resumes, until all clusters have been detected. The pseudo-code for the stack algorithm is shown in Figure 8. The coloring algorithm was suggested by M. J. Atallah <ref> [1] </ref>. It detects connected components in a binary array by "coloring" them in different colors.

Reference-contexts: In the case of electron microscopy, it extends the scientist's ability to study images of biological structures because details that may be invisible to the naked eye can be clearly revealed. Noise from a variety of sources <ref> [2] </ref>, such as variability in the specimen support film, impurities in the sample, irregularities at the atomic, molecular, or macromolecular level, defocus level, etc, appears in all micrographs to varying extents. Image processing methods identify and separate signal and noise components in the image. <p> Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the reconstruction process (from <ref> [2] </ref>). Boxing, the first step to be performed after the micrograph is digitized, has been traditionally considered a manual process, despite various attempts to automatize it. In this 4 paper we introduce the Crosspoint Method for the detection of the positions of particle pro-jections in electron micrographs.

Reference-contexts: The main reason for which these as well as traditional image processing methods (e.g. edge and shape detection <ref> [3] </ref>, [10], [11]) have failed is that they are extremely sensitive to the variation of the background intensity. Figure 3 (a) shows a portion of a digitized micrograph which contains several particle images. The variation of the intensity along the horizontal line is depicted in Figure 3 (b).

Reference-contexts: The theoretical foundation for the three-dimensional reconstruction process is provided by the Projection Theorem which states that the Fourier transform of the projected structure of a three-dimensional object is equivalent to a two-dimensional central section of the three-dimensional Fourier transform of the object, normal to the direction of projection <ref> [5] </ref>. Indeed, the Fourier transform of the function (x; y; z) is: F (X; Y; Z) = (x; y; z)e 2i (xX+yY +zZ) dxdydz.

Reference-contexts: has been most powerful when applied to particles with high symmetry such as spherical viruses because the high symmetry simplifies the determination of the positions of the symmetry elements in individual images and it also decreases the number of images required to reconstruct a three-dimensional structure at a given resolution <ref> [7] </ref>. Spherical viruses have icosahedral symmetry, that is, the symmetry of an icosahedron or that of a dodecahedron. Figure 1 shows the symmetry properties of an icosahedron. There are three types of rotations that bring it into self-coincidence.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4 shows the result of applying a Sobel transformation to the micrograph shown in Figure 3 (a). Sobel operators are a special case of gradient operators commonly used for edge detection in images <ref> [8] </ref>. As the example shows, the method failed to detect any circular edges in the digitized micrograph. This paper is organized as follows.

As the size of the images increases, from say 1000fi1000 to 6000fi6000 pixels, the efficiency of the algorithms and the amount of memory available become critical. Dividing the image into subimages as suggested in <ref> [14] </ref> complicates the algorithms and may lead to a substantial increase in the running time. Manual procedures are not only tedious, but also very slow and prone to errors. Automatic procedures should be much faster, particularly when used in conjunction with automatic microscope control. <p> Table 2 gives information about the number of particles correctly identified by the Crosspoint Method. Note the very small percentages of missed and "ghost" particles. In <ref> [14] </ref> P. Thuman-Commike reports percentages of "ghost" particles between 30% 17 and 55% which, in our opinion, makes the overall solution unusable for three-dimensional reconstruction unless some further processing is applied to remove these particles. <p> Traditional image 22 processing techniques such as edge or shape detection yield poor results when applied to digitized electron micrographs. Specific techniques based on correlation methods have also been proposed <ref> [14] </ref>. Such methods require a considerable amount of computing time, their complexity is at least O (n fi log (n)) (n is the number of pixels in the image) and the quality of the solution is not satisfactory.
