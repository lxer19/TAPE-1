Abstract: Predicting the behavior of physical systems is essential to both common sense and engineering tasks. It is made especially challenging by the lack of complete precise knowledge of the phenomena in the domain and the system being modelled. We present an implemented approach to automatically building and simulating qualitative models of physical systems. Imprecise knowledge of phenomena is expressed by qualitative representations of monotonic functions and variable values. Incomplete knowledge about the system is either inferred or alternative complete descriptions that will affect behavior are explored. The architecture and algorithms used support both effective implementation and formal analysis. The expressiveness of the modelling language and strength of the resulting predictions are demonstrated by substantial applications to complex systems.

Reference-contexts: Catino and Ungar have conducted a substantial hazard identification case study of nitric acid production plant <ref> (Catino & Ungar 1994) </ref>. Their system begins with a scenario describing the design case (normal operation) of the plant and then systematically perturbs this specification to generate fault scenarios. The fault scenarios are simulated by QPC and checked for the presence of hazards. <p> QPC's hybrid architecture exploits independent advances in model building and qualitative simulation techniques and supports formal analysis. The incremental algorithm takes advantage of knowledge about a system's initial conditions when available. This claim is supported by substantial applications. In particular, the nitric acid production plant application <ref> (Catino & Ungar 1994) </ref> shows that QPC can model and simulate complex systems requiring hundreds of variables and constraints from automatically generated scenario descriptions.

Reference-contexts: The domain theory covers mass flow, heat flow, chemical reaction, vaporization, and liquid-vapor equilibrium. It is capable of modeling controllers, phases consisting of any number of chemical species, thermal and mass fraction effects of mass flow, and moving landmark values as in a changing dew point <ref> (Catino 1993) </ref>. Catino and Ungar have conducted a substantial hazard identification case study of nitric acid production plant (Catino & Ungar 1994). Their system begins with a scenario describing the design case (normal operation) of the plant and then systematically perturbs this specification to generate fault scenarios.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that the techniques originally employed by QSIM actually give rise to infinite sets of possible behaviors. It is only since the development of techniques to eliminate unnecessary distinctions <ref> (Clancy & Kuipers 1993) </ref>, that they have become tractable. This shows a key advantage of QPC's architecture: advances in simulation techniques are directly exploited. Chemical Engineering Catino and Ungar have been using QPC to support hazard identification in chemical processing plants (Catino 1993; Catino & Ungar 1994).

Reference-contexts: The architecture of QPC directly reflects this decomposition. The model building task is facilitated by a general purpose knowledge representation system. QPC currently uses the Algernon representation system <ref> (Crawford & Kuipers 1991) </ref>. The simulation task is currently handled by the QSIM qualitative simulation system (Kuipers 1986; Farquhar et al. 1991). This approach has several practical and theoretical advantages. The proof of correctness is simplified.

Reference-contexts: The QPC work was first reported in (Crawford, Farquhar, & Kuipers 1990) and is more fully developed in <ref> (Farquhar 1993) </ref>. fl This work has taken place in the Qualitative Reasoning Group at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin and at the Stanford University Knowledge Systems Laboratory. <p> While the instance is active, its consequences hold. These can be (differential) equations, inequalities, or arbitrary logical relations. There are also language constructs for defining relations, axioms, quantities, and the conditions under which entities must exist. The full language is documented in <ref> (Farquhar 1993) </ref>. Each language form is defined by a set of axiom schema; a domain theory is defined by a set of axioms. There are several syntactic restrictions on the language constructs and the axiom schema. <p> Importantly, time is implicit in the user language. This ensures that the present cannot change the past and invalidate itself. The temporal scope of relations is enforced by the axiom schema <ref> (Farquhar 1993) </ref>. The language allows for systems to be described by continuous real-valued variables and time-dependent logical relations. A time-dependent relation is one whose truth value may change over time (e.g. (on-table block1)). The language restricts the interaction between time-dependent relations and quantities. <p> The proof of soundness is given in <ref> (Farquhar 1993) </ref>. It is by induction on the path from the root to a terminal state in the graph. We show that the QPC algorithm constructs the unique initial value problem that must follow from the initial complete database.

The QPC modelling language is a descendent of the expressive language introduced by Forbus for his Qualitative Process theory <ref> (Forbus 1984) </ref>. A model fragment definition specifies a set of typed participants, structural, operating conditions, and consequences. An instance of the fragment exists if participants of the appropriate types can be found that satisfy the structural relations. <p> Thus, the attainable envisionment is exactly the right level of description for QPC. Examples and Applications This section discusses a simple example and two more substantial applications of QPC. The example allows QPC to be compared to GIZMO <ref> (Forbus 1984) </ref> and QPE (Forbus 1990) and shows the advantage of QPC's hybrid architecture. In the botany application, QPC produces answers to questions that might arise in a tutoring application. <p> Under perturbed initial conditions, more interesting dynamic behavior results). Related Work QPC's architecture, algorithms, and soundness guarantee distinguish it from other qualitative modeling systems. Both GIZMO <ref> (Forbus 1984) </ref> and QPE (Forbus 1990) compose qualitative models from a scenario description and a domain theory of model fragments, but they construct the complete set of model fragment instances, variables, inequalities, and so on, that might ever appear in a total en-visionment of the scenario.

Reference-contexts: DME typically expects more interaction from the user than QPC, which is fully automatic. This is in keeping with DME's goal as a modeling environment. DME also provides sophisticated explanation facilities <ref> (Gautier & Gruber 1993) </ref>. Conclusion QPC provides an expressive language and powerful techniques for reasoning about physical systems without a precise domain theory or a complete specification of the system. QPC's hybrid architecture exploits independent advances in model building and qualitative simulation techniques and supports formal analysis.

The sources of incompleteness can be readily identified, localized, and methods to reduce them determined. The output of QPC can be directly understood in terms of ordinary differential equations and their solutions.

Reference-contexts: Some of this is inherent in the accurate, but imprecise, representation (Stru 1990). But qualitative simulators are also incomplete due to their reliance on local constraint satisfaction and continuity. Recent work has substantially improved the strength of predictions by exploiting non-local constraints and more sophisticated mathematics <ref> (Lee & Kuipers 1993) </ref>. QPC effortlessly takes advantage of such advances in qualitative simulation. Information can also be lost at transitions, resulting in incompleteness. For instance, QPC currently requires variables to be everywhere continuous in magnitude.

Reference-contexts: In fitting with QPC's hybrid architecture, the natural approach is to use a special purpose inequality reasoner such as Bounder (Sacks 1987), the quantity lattice (Simmons 1986), or even QSIM, as is done by DME <ref> (Low & Iwasaki 1992) </ref>. QSIM and other qualitative simulation algorithms are incomplete. Some of this is inherent in the accurate, but imprecise, representation (Stru 1990). But qualitative simulators are also incomplete due to their reliance on local constraint satisfaction and continuity. <p> Refinement effectively assigns a status to the instances; QSIM assigns values to the variables. Both of these operations are very focused, and apply only to the instances and variables that are relevant to the situation. The device modeling environment, DME <ref> (Low & Iwasaki 1992) </ref>, is the system closest to QPC. In its qualitative prediction mode it also uses QSIM to generate state successors, but does not make full use of QSIM.
