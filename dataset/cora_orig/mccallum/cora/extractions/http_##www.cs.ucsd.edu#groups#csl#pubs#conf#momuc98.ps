Title: Enhancing Wireless Internet Links for Multimedia Services  
Author: George C. Polyzos and George Xylomenos 
Date: October 12-14, 1998, Berlin

Abstract: We describe a novel link layer protocol architecture that aims to enhance the performance of Internet protocols over wireless links, in particular in order to effectively support interactive multimedia applications with varying Quality-of-Service requirements. The degraded performance of these links on the Internet and the inadequacy of existing approaches in overcoming these problems in a protocol independent manner motivate our solution. Our design provides multiple services and performance feedback to higher layers, thus supporting adaptive protocols and applications. In addition, it serves as the basis for Internet evolution towards Quality-of-Service provision, since it can be used to support relevant mechanisms at higher layers, regardless of the underlying hardware.

Reference-contexts: In addition, loss detection is faster, due to shorter timeout values and exploitation of link specific characteristics such as in-order transmission <ref> [7] </ref>. 2. A properly designed, i.e. transport layer independent, link layer scheme is a universal solution, that can sup port multiple higher layer protocols and applications: * It is compatible with and applicable to all higher-level protocols.

Reference-contexts: In the case of Internet traffic it can be applied not only to TCP, but also to UDP, which is the protocol of choice for real-time and multipoint Internet multimedia applications <ref> [8] </ref>. * It can support future higher layers and applications that have not even been conceived yet, by extending the already implemented mechanisms only at links where this is required, in a manner consistent with emerging needs.

Reference-contexts: The link layer, being aware of hardware details, can detect such events fast, while higher layers can filter them into authoritative horizontal or vertical handoff notifications, and act accordingly.

Protocol Stack Framework based on our enhanced link layer and its services. <p> Both endpoints of a single wireless link are usually under the control of a single administrative entity, so both endpoints could update their link layers at the same time. Although the services provided are generic (each one trades-off reliability, delay and throughput in a different manner <ref> [10] </ref>) they can be used to efficiently support existing protocols (such as TCP) and multimedia applications (such as video and/or audio over UDP), making them attractive to equipment vendors and service providers that could deploy them with the incentive of gaining a competitive advantage on the market over their competitors.

Reference-contexts: It is possible (but not required) that higher layers will also provide QoS-based services to the transport layer, for example a Class Based Queuing (CBQ) mechanism can be used to ensure sharing of gateway transmission bandwidth in a predefined manner during periods of congestion <ref> [11] </ref>, [12]. Such services can be established end-to-end using RSVP as the setup and negotiation mechanism [13]. The goal of our data link layer is to enhance the service offered to each class according to its requirements, without interfering with higher layer QoS provisions.

Reference-contexts: Even if only some links on a path offer such advanced characteristics, suitable higher layers can compose more flexible end-to-end services using service substitutions <ref> [14] </ref> negotiated by a service establishment protocol such as RSVP. The measurements can be used directly by any higher layer, or modified by intermediate layers to account for their own mechanisms (such as error recovery).

Reference-contexts: Our measurements using the raw services of the wireless LAN, besides giving us ample material for refining the emulator, have also uncovered some interesting effects that are documented separately in more detail <ref> [15] </ref>. For example, TCP traffic under certain conditions suffers from excessive undetected collisions that dramatically reduce performance, an effect not previously documented since most existing results are based on unidirectional UDP tests.
