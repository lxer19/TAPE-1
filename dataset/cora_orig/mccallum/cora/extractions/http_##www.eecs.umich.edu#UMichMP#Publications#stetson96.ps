Abstract: This paper reports a phase-locked loop clock mul-tiplier designed for widebandwidth operation at supply voltages of 0.9 V to 1.5 V. Implemented in Motorolas complementary Gallium-Arsenide (CGaAs) process, the target application is the PUMA processor, a multi-chip microprocessor based on the PowerPC instruction set architecture. This system operates on an input system clock of 100 - 125 MHz, while the pr ocessor clock is targeted to run at a fr equency of 1 GHz. Phase-lock ed loop clock multiplication factors of 2 to 16 ar e supported, while the achievable output frequency ranges from 110 MHz to 775 MHz. The chip utilizes Motorolas 0.7 mm CGaAs process and is entirely implemented with the dir ect-coupled FET standard cell library developed for the PUMA project. This paper discusses the design and implementation of the clock multiplier . Test results are presented. The design measures 1.4 mm 2 , including the fully integrated passive filter. The core power dissipation is 300mW at 1.5 V, and 36mW at 0.9 V.

Reference-contexts: Section III presents measured results, while section IV concludes the paper. A. Phase Detector There are three types of phase detectors generally used in the classical DPLL: the EXOR g ate, the JK flip-flop, and the phase-frequency detector <ref> [1] </ref>. The phase-frequenc y detector (PFD) is typically the phase detector of choice because its output depends both on frequenc y and phase. This ability allows a DPLL with a PFD to lock under an y condition (assuming the VCO can achieve the required frequency). <p> Though this kind of implementation illustrates the principle behind the PFD, there is an important parameter called the backlash which is relatively poor in such an implementation. The backlash is the smallest difference in phase between the two input clock signals for which there is an output response <ref> [1] </ref>. This parameter contrib utes significantly to the phase jitter and steady-state phase error of the PLL. The backlash is directly related to the propag ation delay of the g ates used. To improve performance in this respect, the implementation in Fig. 2 w as used.

Reference-contexts: The backlash is directly related to the propag ation delay of the g ates used. To improve performance in this respect, the implementation in Fig. 2 w as used. This design w as adapted from a PFD presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. This implementation uses NOR gates in place of NAND gates because the NOR gates have faster gate speeds in DCFL which results in a smaller backlash. B. <p> These devices ensure that the tw o ring oscillators power up 180 degrees out of phase [6]. The ring oscillators were designed with three stages. The voltage variable RC delay netw ork at the output of each inverting stage is a voltage controlled resistor <ref> [3] </ref> and junction capacitor. The voltage controlled resistor was observed to provide a more gradual v oltage to frequency response to the VCO than a single transistor, providing a wider range of control voltage.

Reference-contexts: The capacitor is 100 pF in value and is composed from a four-layer plate capacitor stack. C. Voltage Controlled Oscillator The voltage controlled oscillator was implemented using a variation on the design reported by <ref> [6] </ref>. A ring oscillator is made by cascading an odd number of inverting gates together, with feedback from the last gate to the first. This structure has no stable state, and outputs a signal with a period equal to twice the sum of the g ate delays. <p> This structure produces a differential clock signal that is very close to 50% duty cycle. One should also note the p-type de vices connected between the two ring oscillators across stages. These devices ensure that the tw o ring oscillators power up 180 degrees out of phase <ref> [6] </ref>. The ring oscillators were designed with three stages. The voltage variable RC delay netw ork at the output of each inverting stage is a voltage controlled resistor [3] and junction capacitor.
