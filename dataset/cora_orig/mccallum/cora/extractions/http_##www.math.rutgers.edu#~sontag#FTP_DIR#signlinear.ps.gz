Abstract: This paper deals with systems that are obtained from linear time-invariant continuous-or discrete-time devices followed by a function that just provides the sign of each output. Such systems appear naturally in the study of quantized observations as well as in signal processing and neural network theory. Results are given on observability, minimal realizations, and other system-theoretic concepts. Certain major differences exist with the linear case, and other results generalize in a surprisingly straightforward manner.

Reference-contexts: Borrowing from the signal processing terminology, perceptrons are "finite impulse response" sign-linear systems. As such, they are not suited to modeling time dependencies and recurrences in the data. More general sign-linear systems are called for, and this motivated the introduction of such systems in <ref> [1] </ref>, using the name "infinite impulse response" again by analogy to the classical linear case. In that paper, the authors studied practical problems of systems identification, but did not address the more system-theoretic types of questions that this paper deals with. <p> Some other examples of constrained-output systems are as follows: * Output-Saturated Systems (satisfying 1,3,4), those with (x) = s (x); where s (x) = &gt; &lt; 1 if x &gt; 1 1 if x &lt; 1 The output space for output-saturated systems is <ref> [1; 1] </ref> p . <p> We will use the notation x + (t) to mean x (t + 1), and we drop the argument t from now on. Example 2.5. Let be the system with equations x + = 0; y 1 = (x); y 2 = (2x); and ( 1 x 2 <ref> [1; 2] </ref> The nonlinearity is not one-to-one, but the map x 7! ((x); (2x)) is one-to-one, so the system is observable. However, A is not invertible.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in signal processing, when modeling linear channels transmitting digital data from a quantized source, the channel equalization problem becomes one of systems inversion for such systems; see <ref> [2] </ref> and also the related paper [8]. In contrast to Delchamp's work, in this paper we look at the more standard notion of multiple-experiment observability, which is different for nonlinear systems from the single-experiment concept (for purely linear systems, both concepts do coincide, of course). <p> We will use the notation x + (t) to mean x (t + 1), and we drop the argument t from now on.

Reference-contexts: Among the most popular techniques in pattern classification are those based upon the use of perceptrons or linear discriminants (see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>, [13]). Mathematically, these are simply functions of the type IR n 7! IR p ; v 7! y = sign (Cv) typically with large n and small p; again, the sign is understood as being taken in each coordinate separately.

Reference-contexts: Perceptrons are used to classify input patterns v = (v 1 ; ; v n ) into classes, and they form the basis of many statistical techniques.

Reference-contexts: When no controls are present, this is closely related to classical work on symbolic dynamics, and in fact has been pursued in the control-theory literature, where Ramadge studied in <ref> [9] </ref> the dynamical behavior of observation sequences corresponding to such systems.

Reference-contexts: Saturated-quantized systems have output space fn 2 ZZ : jnj Kg p . More details about such functions, and results specific for some of these classes, are described in the technical report <ref> [10] </ref>. 2. Observability. Our notion of observability is the usual concept of multiple-experiment observability. Let us recall the main ideas. For formal definitions, please refer to [12], Section 5.1. Definition 2.1.

Reference-contexts: When the nonlinearities appear in the feedback loops, the problems become far more difficult; in that context, see for instance <ref> [11] </ref> for results about the computational power of systems of the type x (t + 1) = (Ax (t) + Bu (t)). 1.1. Summary of Paper.

Reference-contexts: Then we are dealing with the class of all finite dimensional linear systems. See <ref> [12] </ref> for precise definitions of "system" and related terms.) Models of the form (1) with quantizer arise also in a variety of other areas besides control. <p> More details about such functions, and results specific for some of these classes, are described in the technical report [10]. 2. Observability. Our notion of observability is the usual concept of multiple-experiment observability. Let us recall the main ideas. For formal definitions, please refer to <ref> [12] </ref>, Section 5.1. Definition 2.1. A system is observable if for any two initial states, there is some control which produces different outputs for each of the two initial states. <p> The (Hankel) rank of a sequence A is defined to be sup rank H s;t : An input/output map (for a precise definition, see <ref> [12] </ref>, Remark 2.2.2) is a function of controls u defined on some time interval [; t ), which gives the entire output function for the time interval [; t ]. Definition 4.2. <p> Thus, (A; B; fl 1 C) and ( ^ A; ^ B; fl 2 ^ C) are both canonical linear representations of the same Markov sequence A. By <ref> [12] </ref>, Theorem 20, they must be similar, i.e., there exists some T 2 Gl (n) so that T 1 AT = ^ A, T 1 B = ^ B, and fl 1 CT = fl 2 ^ C. <p> Furthermore, it is easy to verify that commutes with the dynamics of so it is a system morphism in the sense of <ref> [12] </ref>, Section 5.8. Lemma 5.2. The system ~ is reachable and observable and realizes the same input/output behavior as . Proof. Since ~ is the observable reduction of , and is reachable, [12] Lemma 5.8.3 implies that ~ is both reachable and observable with the same input/output behavior as . <p> to verify that commutes with the dynamics of so it is a system morphism in the sense of <ref> [12] </ref>, Section 5.8. Lemma 5.2. The system ~ is reachable and observable and realizes the same input/output behavior as . Proof. Since ~ is the observable reduction of , and is reachable, [12] Lemma 5.8.3 implies that ~ is both reachable and observable with the same input/output behavior as . Example 5.3. Let be the system with state space IR 2 and x + x + y = sign (x 1 + x 2 ): Then is minimal. <p> Remark 6.1. Suppose that (A; B; C) has property P. Then the continuous-time sign-linear system (A; B; C) s is observable. Proof. We will prove this by studying the associated sampled system. Using the notations and terminology in <ref> [12] </ref> (Section 2.10), for each ffi &gt; 0, the ffi-sampled system corresponding to is: P ( y = sign (Cx) where F = e ffiA , G = A (ffi) B, and A (ffi) = R ffi 0 e (ffis)A ds. <p> If this is true then the sampled system would be observable (clearly det e ffiA 6= 0). Hence, is observable using only piecewise constant controls which are constant on intervals of length ffi, and the result is proved. Apply Kalman's sampling theorem (see <ref> [12] </ref>, Proposition 5.2.11), to the pair (A; ^ C) obtained by dropping the rows of C not in I (A).
