Abstract: We study structure theorems for the conjugacy closed (CC-) loops, a specific variety of G-loops (loops isomorphic to all their loop isotopes). These theorems give a description all such loops of small order. For example, if p and q are primes, p &lt; q, and q 1 is not divisible by p, then the only CC-loop of order pq is the cyclic group of order pq. For any prime q &gt; 2, there is exactly one non-group CC-loop in order 2q, and exactly three in order q 2 . We also derive a number of equations valid in all CC-loops. By contrast, every equation valid in all G-loops is valid in all loops.

Reference-contexts: The theory of isotopy lets us associate with (G; ) a number of permutation groups. One may then apply familiar methods from group theory to study G. We begin with the autotopy group (see <ref> [1] </ref>, p. 112). 2 ISOTOPY AND G-LOOPS 5 Definition 2.1 SYM (G) is the group of all permutations of the set G; I 2 SYM (G) is the identity element. <p> In a G-loop, Definition 2.5 "seems" to pair an ff 2 II (G; ) with an (a; b) 2 G 2 , but this "correspondence" is not a function. By Bryant and Schneider <ref> [1] </ref> and R. L. Wilson, Jr. [18], each ff has jN j corresponding (a; b), and each (a; b) has jAU T (G; )j corresponding ff. Hence, jGj 2 jAU T (G; )j = jII (G; )j jN j. <p> Corollary 3.21 G is flexible iff every hxi is a nuclear subloop of G. A flexible CC-loop is an extra loop [11], and hence a Moufang loop [7][8]. By Moufang's Theorem <ref> [1] </ref>, every Moufang loop is diassociative. It follows immediately that: Proposition 3.22 If G satisfies the flexible law, then it is diassociative. <p> H is an isolated subloop iff H is nuclear and HJ x = H for all x 2 G. In groups, "characteristic" has its usual meaning, while "isolated" is equivalent to "normal". We use "isolated" here because "normal" already has a somewhat different meaning <ref> [1] </ref> in loops. Note that the nucleus is both characteristic and isolated. Lemma 4.1 If H is either a nuclear or a characteristic subloop of G, then any two right cosets, Ha and Hb, are either equal or disjoint. <p> For (2) and (3), the result is immediate by Lemma 4.1 A special case of (2) or of (3) is that jGj is divisible by the size of the nucleus, but this fact is true in all loops <ref> [1] </ref>. Corollary 4.5 If 1 &lt; jGj &lt; 1, then G contains an isomorphic copy of Z p for some prime factor p of G. <p> Thus, (1) above is a universal sentence. Theorem 5.1 If ' is a universal sentence true in all G-loops, then ' is true in all loops. Bruck <ref> [1] </ref> (p. 57) asked if one could find "necessary and sufficient conditions upon the loop G in order that" G be a G-loop. By Theorem 5.1, such conditions cannot be just universal statements. We do not know whether such conditions can be first-order.

Reference-contexts: Bryant and Schneider <ref> [2] </ref> called II (G; ) the group of (G; ). It is immediate from the definitions that: Lemma 2.1 Each of the sets AU T (G; ); LII (G; ); RII (G; ); II (G; ) is a subgroup of SYM (G).

Reference-contexts: The notion of "saturated" is borrowed from model theory <ref> [3] </ref>, but it has a somewhat different meaning there. Note in particular, with H = f1g, that a saturated loop contains isomorphic copies of all finite loops. So, Lemma 5.5 If the loop (G; ) is saturated, then every universal sentence true in (G; ) is true in all loops.

Reference-contexts: By a theorem of Evans, every finite incomplete loop may be extended to a loop on a possibly larger finite set: Lemma 5.3 (Evans <ref> [6] </ref>) If (G; ffi) is an incomplete loop, then there is a loop (H; fl) such that G H, jHj 2 jGj, and fl agrees with ffi wherever ffi is defined.

Reference-contexts: CC-loop is an extra loop [11], and hence a Moufang loop [7]<ref> [8] </ref>. By Moufang's Theorem [1], every Moufang loop is diassociative. It follows immediately that: Proposition 3.22 If G satisfies the flexible law, then it is diassociative. In an extra loop, the square of every element is in the nucleus [8]; in particular, the nucleus is non-trivial (since if x 2 = 1 for all x, then G must be a group by Corollary 3.19).

Reference-contexts: The structure theory for CC-loops uses combinatorial arguments similar to those used in the proof of the Sylow theorems. If p &lt; q are primes and q 1 is divisible by p, then in order pq, there are CC-loops which are not groups (see Corollary 3.3.1 of <ref> [10] </ref>), as well as non-abelian groups. The Moufang loops, whose structure is already widely discussed in the literature [1][4], are always diassociative (that is, every two elements generate a group) by Moufang's Theorem. <p> We may now take various products from RII (G; ) and LII (G; ) to produce automorphisms. In particular, as in <ref> [10] </ref>: 2 ISOTOPY AND G-LOOPS 9 Lemma 2.9 If G is conjugacy closed, then for each a; b 2 G, both R a R b R 1 ab ba are automorphisms of G. Proof: By Lemma 2.8, R a R b R 1 ab 2 RII (G; ). <p> However, in CC-loops, the fact that these are automorphisms lets us use automorphism arguments to study non-associative CC-loops in the same way that inner automorphisms are used to study non-commutative groups. Every commutative CC-loop is a group; more generally, for any CC-loop, the three nuclei coincide <ref> [10] </ref> and contain the center: Lemma 2.10 For any CC-loop (G; ): Z (G; ) N (G; ) = N (G; ) = N (G; ) = N (G; ). Proof: Apply Lemma 2.5 and Lemma 2.8, plus the fact that AT OP (G; ) is a group. <p> In a group, E a = I and J a is an inner automorphism. In a CC-loop, E a is an automorphism (by Lemma 2.9); J a need not be an automorphism of the loop, but it does define an automorphism of the nucleus <ref> [10] </ref> (apply Lemma 2.6; note that J a 2 II (G; ) and 1J a = 1). Corollary 2.11 For any CC-loop (G; ), let N = N (G; ). <p> To verify that this really defines a CC-loop, one may plug the equations directly into LCC and RCC, but it is simpler to just verfiy that [G : N] = 2, and then quote Theorem 3.1 of Goodaire and Robinson <ref> [10] </ref>, which says that this implies the loop is CC. The actual construction of this loop is due to Wilson [19]. Next, consider CC-loops of order pq, where p q are odd primes, with q 1 not divisible by p. <p> The actual construction of this loop is due to Wilson [19]. Next, consider CC-loops of order pq, where p q are odd primes, with q 1 not divisible by p. In the case p = q, a non-group CC-loop of order p 2 was described in <ref> [10] </ref>. In the case p &lt; q, we shall show there is none at all; since [10] already proved that any such loop must have a trivial nucleus, it is not surprising that we begin by proving that the nucleus is non-trivial. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 26 Lemma 4.14 Suppose that jGj <p> In the case p = q, a non-group CC-loop of order p 2 was described in <ref> [10] </ref>. In the case p &lt; q, we shall show there is none at all; since [10] already proved that any such loop must have a trivial nucleus, it is not surprising that we begin by proving that the nucleus is non-trivial. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 26 Lemma 4.14 Suppose that jGj = pq, where p q are odd primes and q 1 is not divisible by p. <p> Following Theorems 4.13 and 4.15, one might try to characterize all CC-loops of sizes pq or p 3 (for primes p; q). A more general question is whether the nucleus must be non-trivial. In fact, as pointed out in <ref> [10] </ref>, in all known examples the loop modulo the nucleus is a commutative group. In another direction, one might try to develop a structure theory of G-loops. It is still unknown whether there is a G-loop of order 15.

Reference-contexts: The CC-loops need not even be power associative (that is, every single element generates a group); for example, in Table 1, the single element 4 generates the whole loop. It is shown in <ref> [11] </ref> that the CC-loops which are diassociative (equivalently, Moufang) are the extra loops studied by Fenyves [7][8]. It might seem that the structure for non-power-associative loops might be intractable, but we show (Theorem 3.9) that in a CC-loop, xy = 1 implies that yx is in the nucleus. <p> Hence hci is a group. By Lemma 3.14.1, R c n = R n c for each n, which implies that hci is nuclear. Corollary 3.21 G is flexible iff every hxi is a nuclear subloop of G. A flexible CC-loop is an extra loop <ref> [11] </ref>, and hence a Moufang loop [7][8]. By Moufang's Theorem [1], every Moufang loop is diassociative. It follows immediately that: Proposition 3.22 If G satisfies the flexible law, then it is diassociative.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the special cases where a = 1 or b = 1 will provide us with a supply of permutations in LII (G; ) and RII (G; ) by Lemma 2.3.2 and Lemma 2.3.3. Actually, by E. L.

Reference-contexts: In a G-loop, Definition 2.5 "seems" to pair an ff 2 II (G; ) with an (a; b) 2 G 2 , but this "correspondence" is not a function. By Bryant and Schneider [1] and R. L. Wilson, Jr. <ref> [18] </ref>, each ff has jN j corresponding (a; b), and each (a; b) has jAU T (G; )j corresponding ff. Hence, jGj 2 jAU T (G; )j = jII (G; )j jN j. When jGj is prime, this implies that jN j = jGj, so that G is a group. <p> Proof: By Theorem 3.16 either the nucleus is non-trivial or every hxi is a group. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 22 Corollary 4.6 If jGj = p, where p is prime, then G ~ = Z p . Of course, by Wilson <ref> [18] </ref>, this corollary is true of all G-loops. As with normal subgroups of groups, Lemma 4.7 If H is an isolated subloop of G, then aH = Ha for all a 2 G. <p> Then H = ha; bi is a group of exponent p, and has size greater than p, so it contains a copy of Z p fi Z p . What are the non-group CC-loops of order seven or less? By Wilson <ref> [18] </ref> (or Corollary 4.6), these cannot have prime order, and it is easy to see by inspection that all loops of order four are commutative, and hence groups if they are CC, so that leaves order six.

Reference-contexts: Once one has such an example, it is usually possible to describe it in a more conceptual way; for example, the loop in Table 1 can be recognized as the one already constructed by Wilson (see <ref> [19] </ref> or Theorem 4.13), and the one in Table 2 can be described in terms of cosets of a 4-element nucleus. <p> The actual construction of this loop is due to Wilson <ref> [19] </ref>. Next, consider CC-loops of order pq, where p q are odd primes, with q 1 not divisible by p. In the case p = q, a non-group CC-loop of order p 2 was described in [10].
