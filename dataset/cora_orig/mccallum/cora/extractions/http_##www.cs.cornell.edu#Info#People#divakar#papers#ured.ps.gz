Abstract: The question investigated here is: if two matrices A and B in C N;N have identical behaviour in a unitarily invariant norm kk, i.e., kp(A)k = kp(B)k for every polynomial p with complex coefficients, what properties do A and B have in common? After a preliminary result about eigenvalues, it is shown with a mildly restrictive assumption that if A is unitarily reducible, so is B. A theorem is proved about Hadamard products of the form H ffi H T , where H is Hermitian positive definite. Finally, an example is produced where A and B have identical behaviour in the Frobenius norm, but are not related to each other in any simple way. By matrix behaviour of a square matrix A in a norm kk, we mean the variation of kp(A)k as p ranges over all polynomials with complex coefficients [2]. Matrix behaviour provides vital information about the matrix. For example, for a discrete process defined by x n+1 = Ax n , boundedness of kA n k is the condition for stability. Thus the task of understanding matrix behaviour is an important one. For a normal matrix, the eigenvalues determine behaviour in any unitarily invariant norm [3]. For a non-normal matrix, however, the eigenvalues do not determine behaviour. Eigenval-ues have been generalized to pseudospectra with the aim of capturing the behaviour of non-normal matrices [5]. In this paper, we explore the converse question: if the behaviour of A in a unitarily invariant norm is known, what properties of A may be deduced?

Reference-contexts: If R 12 6= 0, B has a row with 2-norm greater than 1. Therefore 1 (B) &gt; 1. Since k 1 k 2 , the interlacing inequalities for singular values imply i (B) i (A) for every i <ref> [4] </ref>. Given that 1 (B) &gt; 1 (A) = 1 and that i (B) i (A) for every i, the quasilinear characterization of unitarily invariant norms in Theorem 3.5.5 of [4] implies that kBk &gt; kAk. This contradicts kAk = kBk. Therefore, R 12 = 0 as desired. <p> Since k 1 k 2 , the interlacing inequalities for singular values imply i (B) i (A) for every i <ref> [4] </ref>. Given that 1 (B) &gt; 1 (A) = 1 and that i (B) i (A) for every i, the quasilinear characterization of unitarily invariant norms in Theorem 3.5.5 of [4] implies that kBk &gt; kAk. This contradicts kAk = kBk. Therefore, R 12 = 0 as desired. Since the second half of the previous proof is interesting in its own right, we state it as a proposition. Proposition 1.3. <p> The significance of Hadamard products of the form H ffi H T and several of their properties are discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. The matrix obtained by replacing every element of A by its complex conjugate is denoted by A. Lemma 2.2. Let y 2 C N and let H 2 C N;N be Hermitian positive definite. If y ffi H y = 0, then y = 0. Proof. <p> Then Y ffi H 1 Y H 2 = 0 is equivalent to Y 0 ffi (H T 2 H 1 ) Y 0 = 0, where denotes the Kronecker product. Since (H T 2 H 1 ) is Hermitian positive definite <ref> [4] </ref>, Lemma 2.2 implies Y 0 = 0. Hence Y = 0 as claimed. A theorem due to Schur says that A ffi B is Hermitian positive definite if A and B are Hermitian positive definite [4]. <p> Since (H T 2 H 1 ) is Hermitian positive definite <ref> [4] </ref>, Lemma 2.2 implies Y 0 = 0. Hence Y = 0 as claimed. A theorem due to Schur says that A ffi B is Hermitian positive definite if A and B are Hermitian positive definite [4]. Therefore, if H is Hermitian positive definite, so is H ffi H T . Theorem 2.4.
