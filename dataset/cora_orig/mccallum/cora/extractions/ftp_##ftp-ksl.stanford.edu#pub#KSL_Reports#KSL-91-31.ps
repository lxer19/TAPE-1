Title: Proposal: Performing Invention with Analogies to "Far-Flung" Concepts  
Author: Michael Wolverton and Barbara Hayes-Roth 
Abstract: This project proposal addresses the issue of retrieving and using analogies to guide a creative design process. There is evidence that human designers use analogies to produce novel creative designs. These analogies are unique in that they often associate concepts that are not normally thought of as connected. That is, the concepts do not share many superficial or even structural features, while they still share underlying functional properties. The purpose of our project is to develop and implement a computational model of creative design which retrieves and uses these types of "distant" analogies. We have developed an architecture in which the search through a knowledge base for an analogy is guided by knowledge about design, knowledge about analogies, and feedback from "near-misses" encountered previously in the search. This architecture is being implemented in a design program which uses retrieved analogies to refine design specifications. Analogy plays a large role in many of the different types of reasoning and problem solving that people do. We use analogies in all sorts of everyday activities: explaining unfamiliar ideas, persuading others to adopt a point of view, solving unfamiliar problems, etc. Analogy is also useful in many tasks which require a high degree of expertise: Lawyers rely extensively on analogies to past cases for insights into new ones, doctors often diagnose and treat patients by recalling similar cases that they have treated, and inventors and others who design creatively often rely on analogies for their "inspiration". It is this ubiquity of analogy in human intelligence that has led artificial intelligence researchers to study ways to add analogy capabilities to computer reasoning systems. This project is devoted to studying the use of analogy in invention. The analogies used by inventors are particularly interesting because the usefulness of the analogy seems to depend on the disparity between the two analogous concepts. That is, the more dissimilar the two concepts are (at least on a superficial level), the more likely that the analogy between them will lead to a creative new design. So while a doctor

Reference-contexts: One mechanism which meets this need for flexibility is spreading activation. Spreading activation is a theory of memory access which has evolved in cognitive psychology over the past twenty years [Quillian, 1968, Collins and Loftus, 1975]. In its current form, embodied by John Anderson's ACT* architecture <ref> [Anderson, 1983] </ref>, each node in the semantic network is associated with an activation level - 5 a number which more or less represents the degree to which the system is "paying attention to" that node. <p> At present we are using a simple threshold on the aggregate activation in all the nodes of a graph. 1 This is a slightly simplified version of the activation formula used by Anderson. See <ref> [Anderson, 1983] </ref>, p. 22. 1 3 Spreading activation demonstrates the kind of flexibility needed for a general retrieval mechanism. It allows activation to be spread from any concept or collection of concepts in the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Agogino et al's program aids the designer's retrieval process by feeding the designer a wide range of sensory stimulation in a short amount of time. Another approach <ref> [Freudenstein and Maki, 1983] </ref> enumerates through pertu-bation techniques all possible combinations of primitive kinematic units, and then uses rules to prune infeasible or undesirable combinations. This technique led to a design of a new variable-stroke internal-combustion engine that was later patented.
