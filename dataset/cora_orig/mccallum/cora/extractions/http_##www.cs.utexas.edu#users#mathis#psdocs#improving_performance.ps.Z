Abstract: We explore the performance of reliable data communication in mobile computing environments. Motion across wireless cell boundaries causes increased delays and packet losses while the network learns how to route data to a host's new location. Reliable transport protocols like TCP interpret these delays and losses as signs of network congestion. They consequently throttle their transmissions, further degrading performance. We quantify this degradation through measurements of protocol behavior in a wireless networking testbed. We show how current TCP implementations introduce unacceptably long pauses in communication during cellular handoffs (800 milliseconds and longer), and propose an end-to-end fast retransmission scheme that can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for human interaction (200 milliseconds). Our work makes clear the need for reliable transport protocols to differentiate between motion-related and congestion-related packet losses, and suggests how to adapt these protocols to perform better in mobile computing environments.

Reference-contexts: They adapt to prevailing end-to-end delay conditions throughout the life of a connection, and interpret unexpected increases in delay as packet losses caused by congestion. In response to perceived losses, protocols like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <ref> [3] </ref> aggressively slow their transmissions to allow the network to recover. These congestion control policies have proven beneficial in improving the overall performance of networks like the Internet.

Reference-contexts: When motion is mistaken for congestion, these procedures result in significant reductions in throughput and unacceptable interactive delays for active connections. The degradation is readily apparent, for example, to users of emerging ubiquitous computing environments <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper quantifies the effects of motion on throughput and delay, identifies the factors that contribute to the loss of performance, and suggests an end-to-end approach for alleviating the problem.

Reference-contexts: However, recent research shows that, under certain packet loss conditions, competing retransmission strategies in the link and transport layers can interact to reduce end-to-end throughput while increasing link utilization <ref> [5] </ref>. Alternative techniques such as selective retransmissions at the transport layer may prove more effective than link-layer retransmissions. We wanted to isolate the effects of motion across cell boundaries from the effects of wireless transmission errors.

Reference-contexts: A separate measurement study found that WaveLAN exhibited excellent packet capture rates (over 99%) in an indoor environment <ref> [6] </ref>. However, in our environment, packet loss frequency varies widely even across short distances and depends on such factors as the positions of antennas in a room. Such problems are common in wireless communication because wireless media are vulnerable to ambient noise and multipath interference.

This paper also describes how using TCP's fast retransmission procedure can reduce these pauses to 0.2 seconds. <p> All hosts and support stations are equipped with 50-MHz i486 processors, 330-Mbyte hard disks, 16 Mbytes of memory, and the necessary network interface hardware. They run the 4.3BSD-Tahoe version of TCP from the University of California at Berkeley, Mobile IP software from Columbia University <ref> [7] </ref>, and the Mach 3.0 microkernel and Unix server (MK77/UX37) from Carnegie Mellon University [1]. 4.3BSD-Tahoe TCP is widely used throughout the Internet and implements exponential retransmission backoffs and the slow-start algorithm. 2.1 Cellular handoff procedures Each MSS defines one cell and is responsible for the MHs in its cell. <p> Finally, the new MSS acknowledges the completion of the handoff to the MH. Further details of this protocol are found in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.2 Methodology In our experiments, we initiate a reliable data transfer over a TCP connection between an MH and an SH, we cause the MH to cross cell boundaries while the connection is active, and we measure the performance of the connection.

Reference-contexts: If the current delay is longer than the average by more than twice the expected deviation, TCP assumes that the packet was lost. In response, TCP retransmits the lost packet and initiates congestion control procedures to give the network a chance to recover <ref> [8] </ref>. First, TCP drops the transmission window size to reduce the amount of data in transit through the network. Second, it activates the slow-start algorithm to restrict the rate at which the window grows to previous levels. <p> TCP's slow-start algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> is responsible for this behavior. As acknowledgments reach the TCP transmitter, slow start first grows the congestion window exponentially until it reaches a threshold, then grows it linearly. The threshold is set to one half of the window size at the time of the retransmission timeout.

Reference-contexts: These futile retransmis sions waste bandwidth in the slow wireless medium. In general, it is difficult for a timer-based scheme to adapt to the abrupt changes in round-trip delay introduced by cellular handoffs. 4.3 Fast retransmissions An attractive end-to-end solution <ref> [10] </ref> to the problems presented in Section 3 is for the transport protocol to resume communication immediately after handoffs complete, without waiting for a retransmission timeout.

Reference-contexts: Studies of human factors indicate that people perceive interactive response to be "bad" if it takes longer than 100 to 200 milliseconds <ref> [11] </ref>. As discussed above and shown in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6, transport-level communication comes to a halt for 800 milliseconds or longer after non-overlapping cell crossings. Furthermore, these pauses grow exponentially with growing rendezvous delays due to TCP's exponential retransmission backoff policy.
