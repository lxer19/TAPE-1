Abstract: We have used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the capabilities of a Hybrid air shower detector, designed primarily for cosmic ray energies greater than 10 19 eV. We find that precise geometrical reconstruction of the shower axis leads to excellent resolution in energy and depth of shower maximum. The technique is also shown to provide very good reconstruction below 10 19 eV, at energies where the ground array is not fully efficient.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An international collaboration has been formed to build the next generation of air shower detectors, spurred on by the mysterious origin of cosmic rays of the highest energies <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> with water detectors of the same area and on the same grid spacing) will have only a small effect on the geometrical reconstruction accuracy, and hence a small effect on the fluorescence detector's determination of energy and depth of maximum. 2 Simulation Method Details of the simulation are given in <ref> [1] </ref>. Briefly, showers were generated using analytical parametrizations of the longitudinal development and lateral spread. For the longitudinal development, the Gaisser-Hillas profile was used [10], and the mean depth of shower maximum as a function of energy was chosen to be consistent with Fly's Eye measurements [11].

Reference-contexts: The combination of a ground array and fluorescence detector, known as the Hybrid concept, means that a rich variety of measurements can be made on a subset of showers, providing much improved resolution over what is possible with either a ground array or a single fluorescence detector alone <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. Apart from important cross-checks and measurement redundancy, the two techniques see air showers in complementary ways. The ground array measures the lateral structure of the shower at ground level, with some ability to separate the electromagnetic and muon components.

Reference-contexts: However, during the 10-15% of the time that both detectors are operating, extremely well measured showers will be collected, and the resulting cross-checks between the techniques will allow for confident operation of the ground array alone for the remainder of the time. A recent paper by Sommers <ref> [9] </ref> describes the motivation behind the Hybrid detector in detail, and estimates the shower reconstruction precision using analytic arguments. <p> The most promising ground array parameter is the arrival time of the shower core at the ground <ref> [9] </ref>. It is obvious from Figure 1 (b) 4 that if all eye and ground array times are measured with a common clock, then the ground array times will certainly constrain the timing fit within the SDP. <p> The improvement gained by using array data is especially seen in the 90% figure, indicating its power in cleaning up tails in the error distributions. 5 Conclusions We have tested the analytical predictions of Sommers <ref> [9] </ref> relating to the performance of a Hybrid air shower array. The geometrical reconstruction possible with such a detector is superior to that obtainable with either a ground array alone, or a single fluorescence detector alone.

The experimentally measured AGASA lateral distribution function <ref> [12] </ref> (with zenith angle dependence) was used to determine the scintillator response on the ground. Fluctuations introduced into the longitudinal shower development were translated into fluctuations in the shower size at ground level. The shower front curvature and thickness have always been difficult parameters to measure 2 experimentally. <p> Both simulations have been developed over long periods, and have been refined using results from observations. Further details on the fluorescence simulations can be found in references [14, 15] and in reference <ref> [12] </ref> for the ground array. The fluorescence detector simulated here is composed of 43 mirror units, each with a mirror diameter of 4.14 m and each containing a cluster of 256 photomultiplier tubes covering a solid angle of 216 square degrees.

Reference-contexts: Instead, data tables have been produced which parametrize the delay of shower particles behind an imaginary plane shower front, using an ensemble of simulated vertical proton showers at 10 19 eV. These showers were generated using the MOCCA program <ref> [13] </ref>. We have included the response of standard AGASA type scintillators to low energy gammas and electrons. Given this shower input, the response of the fluorescence detector and ground array were calculated using variants of the standard HiRes and AGASA simulation programs.

The addition of ground array information to constrain the fluorescence fit will then be outlined. 3.1 Fluorescence Detector Geometric Reconstruction For a shower viewed by a single HiRes detector, the standard fitting procedure starts with the determination of the plane containing the shower axis and the eye. <p> The method used for profile reconstruction is that used in the Fly's Eye and HiRes experiments (see <ref> [14] </ref> for a description). Essentially, it is the reverse of the process used in the event simulation.

Reference-contexts: This shower-detector plane 3 (SDP) fit is done using tube pointing directions, together with signal integrals. Phototube timing information is not used at this stage, except to discard noise tubes. The SDP fitting procedure is described in detail in <ref> [16] </ref>. Briefly, trial planes are compared with the pointing directions of fired phototubes, with the fit weighted by the signal amplitudes. We have not exploited any pulse width information that would be available in the proposed detector.

Reference-contexts: There can be a problem with these timing fits, especially for short (ie distant) shower tracks. This has long been recognised, and is one reason the "stereo" Fly's Eye technique was pursued as an alternative to single eye observations <ref> [17] </ref>. With short tracks it is often the case that the range of i sampled is not large enough to detect significant curvature in the tangent function in the above equation. In other words, the shower appears to pass through the field of view with constant angular velocity.

Reference-contexts: Excellent synchronization of the fluorescence detector clock with the ground array clocks will be possible using Global Positioning System receivers. Relative timing accuracy of around 10 ns has been demonstrated over long baselines <ref> [18] </ref>. The full Hybrid geometrical reconstruction proceeds in the following way. The SDP is determined using fluorescence information only, as before.

Reference-contexts: We are assuming that the atmosphere at the observatory site (particularly the aerosol structure) will be monitored and characterised using lasers, in a way similar to that being used at the HiRes site in Utah <ref> [19] </ref>. The method used for profile reconstruction is that used in the Fly's Eye and HiRes experiments (see [14] for a description). Essentially, it is the reverse of the process used in the event simulation. <p> Of course, this simulation ignores other possible systematic effects, including those related to intrinsic fluorescence yields and atmospheric transmission. However, progress is being made in both problem areas <ref> [19, 20] </ref>. So far we have concentrated on results at 10 19 eV, the threshold energy for the array as described. At an energy of 10 18 eV, the array is not fully efficient. However, showers of this energy may trigger two or three array detectors.
