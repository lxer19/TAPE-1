Reference-contexts: The precise meaning of the terms `efficient' and `fair' has been a target of extensive debate in the last two decades. References <ref> [1] </ref>, [21], [24], [8], [7] contain a variety of approaches and definitions of fairness and efficiency. The approach adopted in this work chooses the so-called maxmin or bottleneck optimality criterion discussed in various modifications in [1], [12], [17], [23], [26]. This approach is based on the following intuition. <p> References <ref> [1] </ref>, [21], [24], [8], [7] contain a variety of approaches and definitions of fairness and efficiency. The approach adopted in this work chooses the so-called maxmin or bottleneck optimality criterion discussed in various modifications in [1], [12], [17], [23], [26].

Such rate vector is known as maxmin fair allocation. The above global synchronized procedure for achieving maxmin optimal rates is well known and is described for instance in <ref> [1] </ref>, [23]. It can be easily seen that the rate allocation obtained in such a way is fair in the sense that all sessions constrained by a particular bottleneck get an equal share of this bottleneck capacity. <p> The results here are quite similar to those given in <ref> [1] </ref>, [23], [15], [26]. However, this work considers a somewhat different model than the cited authors, since our model accounts for the bandwidth consumed by feedback flows.

Reference-contexts: There is a vast amount of work addressing the issue of preserving feasible user rates under various assumptions on the underlying service discipline and the shape of source traffic. (see for example <ref> [3] </ref>, [11], [12], [14], [25]). This thesis addresses the first problem, i.e. how to determine the set of optimal rates in a distributed network under dynamic changes in the absence of centralized knowledge about the network and without synchronization of different network components.

Reference-contexts: Upon receipt of the feedback signal the source adjusts its estimate of the allowed transmission rate according to some rule. These algorithms essentially differ in the particular choices of link controls and the type of feedback provided to the source by the network. 13 References <ref> [6] </ref>, [15], [17] describe distributed algorithms of this type.

Reference-contexts: The approach adopted in this work is based on the cooperation between the sources and the network in sustaining an acceptable network load from the standpoint of fairness and efficiency. This approach is similar to that of <ref> [23] </ref> and [26]. The problem of load allocation is twofold the sources must be able 7 to determine their optimal load, and the network must ensure that even if all sources operate at their optimal rates, these rates are enforced across the network. <p> References [1], [21], [24], [8], [7] contain a variety of approaches and definitions of fairness and efficiency.

Consider a network consisting of one bottleneck link of capacity C shared by two sessions with the desired demand D. <p> R 2 : 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 6.75, 7.25, 7.75, 8.25, 8.75, 9.25, 9.75, 10.25, 5.125, Mosley <ref> [23] </ref> calculates link controls as max i r i + C i r i n , where r i is the "observed rate" of session i across the link and n is the number of sessions crossing the link.

This approach is based on the following intuition. Consider a network with given link capacities, the set of sessions and 10 fixed session routes. <p> Thus, for general distribution of arrival and service times utilizing the bottleneck to its full capacity is not good for efficiency. Thus, in this case a different efficiency criterion is called for. Reference <ref> [26] </ref> introduces the optimal efficiency criterion for a general network configuration as the maximum power of the bottleneck resource, where Resource P ower = Bottleneck Resource T hroughput Bottleneck Resource Response T ime The resource capacity at which the power is maximized is called the knee capacity. <p> Mosley in [23] suggested an asynchronous algorithm for distributed calculation of maxmin fair rates. The algorithm was shown to converge to maxmin optimal rates. However, the algorithm convergence time was rather slow and simulations showed poor adaptation to dynamic changes in the network. Later Ramakrishnan, Jain and Chiu in <ref> [26] </ref> suggested a distributed asynchronous algorithm for achieving maxmin optimal rates which uses a different type of feedback. The switches still calculate fair rate allocation for all sessions crossing its outgoing links, but this allocation is not explicitly communicated to the source. <p> The results here are quite similar to those given in [1], [23], [15], <ref> [26] </ref>. However, this work considers a somewhat different model than the cited authors, since our model accounts for the bandwidth consumed by feedback flows. <p> Finally it is instructive to compare the behavior of this algorithm to other algorithms for finding maxmin optimal rates. In particular we will look at Selective Binary Feedback Scheme (SBF) presented in <ref> [26] </ref> and the scheme presented in [23]. While extensive comparison is beyond the scope of this 41 work, we believe that the following simple example gives a good insight on the comparative behavior of these algorithms. <p> Suppose C = 20 and initial rates are R 1 = 100, R 2 = 50. The optimal rate for both session is 10 Selective Binary Feedback Scheme This scheme essentially computes the same value for link controls (called "fair allocation" in <ref> [26] </ref>) as the "ad-vertized rate" in this thesis. However, instead of delivering the minimal value of all link controls to the source, SFB sets a bit in the packet header if the current demand of the session on the link is above the link control value. <p> It is possible to construct other M-consistent policies. In this section we will show that the scheme for link control calculation in the Selective Binary Feedback Scheme presented in <ref> [26] </ref> is also M-consistent. The SBF performs calculation on each update of its link control A fair , called "fair allocation" as follows.

Reference-contexts: The price for this, however, is the lack of flexibility in the presence of dynamic changes in the network load leading to potential waste of precious network resources. Switch-based controls have been shown to be necessary for achieving fairness <ref> [27] </ref>. However, if no source-based control is exercised, the sources may continue to inject excessive traffic into the network, causing more overload and wasting network resources.
