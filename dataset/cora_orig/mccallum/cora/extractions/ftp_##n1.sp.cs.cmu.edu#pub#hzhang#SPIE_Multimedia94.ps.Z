Title: Conference in High-Speed Networking and Multimedia Computing Network Support for Lossless Digital Image Browsing  
Author: Colin Parris and Hui Zhang 
Address: Berkeley, CA 94720  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California at Berkeley  
Abstract: There are two main characteristics that distinguish ordinary video applications from lossless digital image browsing: first, digital images used in medical imaging and scientific visualization applications usually can not tolerate any compromise of image quality; second, unlike live or playback video, browsing implies different playback rates. With these differences, it is no longer possible to increase the browsing speed by dropping alternate frames or by increasing compression ratios as done in video applications. From a network's point of view, the image browsing applications send data at different rates during different periods of time. These type of applications require guaranteed performance service in terms of bandwidth, end-to-end delay and jitter, however, their performance requirements change during the lifetime of the application. Most of the existing solutions that support guaranteed performance services require resource reservation on a per-connection basis and the amount of resources reserved during the lifetime of the connection is usually fixed. The static nature of this type of resource reservation does not easily accommodate the dynamics inherent in applications like lossless image browsing. In this paper, we propose a new abstraction called Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) within the framework of guaranteed performance communications. The DCM scheme provides the network with the ability to modify the performance parameters of any active connection subject to a modification contract. We describe the DCM scheme, validate the design with simulation experiments, and present a prototype implementation within the context of the Sequoia 2000 project.
