Abstract: Many distributed multimedia applications involve data delivery from a source to multiple destinations, the participating nodes forming a multicast group. In the naive solution, separate connections can be established from each source to other group members. However a tree can be established for each source with the participants as the leaf nodes or just have one tree spanning all the participants. In this paper, we introduce a data forwarding model to support such shared multicast trees over the ATM networks called CRAM (Cell Re-labeling At Merge-points for ATM Multicast). Our work allows VC merging in the MPLS architecture and support recently proposed wide area multicast protocols (like CBT and PIM) in ATM networks.

In many applications the group members will be large in number, membership highly dynamic and most of the members are also potential senders [2].

Reference-contexts: An efficient mp-mp VC would also support the mp-mp stream type of an MPLS network and the inverted tree rooted at a destination, used for network scalability. Another goal is to use the Leaf Initiated Join (LIJ)[6] capability to interoperate with Internet protocols like PIM-SM <ref> [7] </ref>, CBT [8] and the evolving GUM [9], all of which support the member (or leaf) initiated shared tree paradigm. STs can be efficiently implemented using a single logical VC per multicast group, which conserves the VC and switch resources in addition to simplifying signaling mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: There are various ways to propagate the level 3 information down to each and every cell: * constraining the topology (i.e., avoiding shared tree VCs altogether) (MARS <ref> [10] </ref>). The MARS-VC Mesh approach exhausts VCI space quickly while MARS-MCS approach concentrates traffic unnecessarily and creates extra management work. * adding information (essentially de-multiplexing, or per source identifier information) to each cell (AAL 3/4 and SPAM [11]). <p> We discuss below two possible designs: Light Weight version of MultiCast Server (MCS) <ref> [10] </ref> (LWMCS) A LWMCS task is activated at only the multicast tree branch merge points in the non-CRAM parts of the network.

Reference-contexts: Globally Unique SID Allocation In this scheme the source intending to join the multicast group gets an unique ID either through some out of band mechanism (like the one proposed in <ref> [13] </ref>) or from a session directory. Note that obtaining an SID is an automated procedure, that is, the user need not request the SID explicitly. For example, assume the multicast group happens to be for a virtual classroom.

Reference-contexts: When a user joins the multicast group, the application implicitly obtains the SID as part of the join mechanism. This is because the application knows that the user is a potential source, if he/she decides to ask questions. Other evolving protocols (e.g., SRM <ref> [14] </ref>) also assume availability of a unique source name similar to CRAM's SID. Dynamic SID Allocation This case is similar to SPAM's MID regeneration approach [11]. A source chooses an SID of its choice.
