Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The goals of our research on partial-order/partial-reliability (PO/PR) transport protocols <ref> [1] </ref> are to (1) determine whether there exist applications for which such protocols can provide better service than currently available protocols, (2) determine how to achieve this improvement in service (i.e., how to implement and use such protocols) and (3) describe and quantify this improvement in service. <p> A partial-order, partial-reliability, no-duplicates (PO/PR) transport protocol is a transport protocol that allows the user to provide a partial order P and reliability vector R to specify the precise level of service required. Partial Order Connection (POC) is an example of such a protocol <ref> [1] </ref>. Another example of a PO/PR transport protocol is presented in RFC1693 [2], which describes how partial order and partial reliability could be added in a backwards-compatible fashion to a stream protocol such as TCP. PO/PR protocols provide a PO/PR service to the application layer.

Reference-contexts: Performance study of (PO/PR) transport protocols has progressed from abstract modeling and simulation <ref> [3] </ref> to a stage where a concrete target application must be chosen. This target application will be used as a reference for designing and interpreting future simulation work. In addition, a working prototype will be implemented for the purpose of measuring empirical performance results. <p> PO/PR protocols provide a PO/PR service to the application layer. Previous research using analytic and simulation models for POC compares the throughput and average packet delay of POC to that of an ordered, reliable service <ref> [3] </ref>. This analysis has shown that there is the potential for performance gains in terms of reduced delay, increased throughput, and reduced buffer requirements.
