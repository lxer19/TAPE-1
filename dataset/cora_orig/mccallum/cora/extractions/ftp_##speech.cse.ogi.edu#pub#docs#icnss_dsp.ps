Reference-contexts: Algorithmic Outline recognition algorithm. This hybrid technology easily lends itself to a pipelined implementation, therefore reducing the associated response time. We now outline the modules of this algorithm which is detailed elsewhere <ref> [1] </ref>.: * Barge-In/End of Utterance Detection: Barge-In (or talk-through), concerns itself with detecting whether the end-user is preempting the voice prompt.

Reference-contexts: Various algorithms have been proposed for detecting speech versus non-speech events <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. These are either based on relative energy measurements, or by looking at the deviations from the spectral characteristics of the background noise. <p> Various algorithms have been proposed for detecting speech versus non-speech events [2, 3]. These are either based on relative energy measurements, or by looking at the deviations from the spectral characteristics of the background noise. We propose a similar method to that to that of Mauuary <ref> [2] </ref>, but choose to use a running estimate of the variance on the absolute amplitude of the signal over time.

Reference-contexts: Together with state duration constraints, we are able to effectively filter short energy events and trigger on end-of-speech events. * DC-Removal: Because the PLP feature computation involves computing the FFT of the waveform, the DC-component is easily removed by setting the first FFT component to zero <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The normalization is performed using a variable gain amplifier in which the gain is controlled by a peak detector on the energy feature. The peak detector has a decay factor of 0.999 and also includes a limiter to prevent excessive gain during silence <ref> [4] </ref>. Currently this form of energy pre-normalization leads to an inherent delay of 160ms in the pipelined recognition process.

Reference-contexts: and facilitate the replacement of the PLP analysis with other feature extractors such as LPC which do not involve a FFT, the DC-component removal unit was imple mented using a simple first-order IIR filter. * Signal Representation: The speech signal is represented using a seventh-order PLP (Perceptual Linear Predictive) analysis <ref> [5] </ref> every 10ms using a 10ms window. This analysis yields eight coefficients per frame (7 cep-stral coefficients and one energy coefficient). * Pre-normalization: The energy coefficient of the input cepstral feature vector is normalized using an automatic gain control filter (AGC), with a look-ahead buffer of 160ms.

Reference-contexts: Regarding Modularity The philosophy behind the real-time implementation was to maintain modularity of run-time code throughout the whole recognition process. Maintaining modularity allows rapid future development of related algorithms. Using the VCOS <ref> [6] </ref> operating environment we were able to efficiently develop stand-alone DSP modules with input, output and parameter buffers. VCOS provides an environment where one can reuse these modules in an application without referring to the assembly code.

Reference-contexts: If several multiply-accumulate instructions are executed one after the other, the DSP32C automatically pipelines the instructions such that one instruction is completed every instruction cycle, but results are not immediately available for re-use. This latency is 4 instruction cycles on the DSP32C <ref> [7] </ref>. The very regular memory access of the matrix vector multiplications of the feed-forward MLP is especially suited for this architecture. The Viterbi search on the other-hand is not well suited for this architecture, since it involves intensive memory usage with multiple floating point comparisons.
