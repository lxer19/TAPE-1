Title: The minimum distance of codes in an array coming from telescopic semigroups  
Author: Christoph Kirfel and Ruud Pellikaan 
Keyword: Key words: geometric Goppa codes, algebraic-geometric codes, algebraic curves, semi-group of Weierstrass point, Feng-Rao bound, error-correcting array, telescopic, decoding.  
Date: (1995), 1720-1732.  
Note: Appeared in: IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, IT-41  
Abstract: The concept of an error-correcting array gives a new bound on the minimum distance of linear codes and a decoding algorithm which decodes up to half this bound. This gives a unified point of view which explains several improvements on the minimum distance of algebraic-geometric codes. Moreover it is explained in terms of linear algebra and the theory of semigroups only.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the work of Feng and Rao <ref> [6] </ref> we find for the first time an effective and efficient decoding algorithm for algebraic-geometric codes which decodes up to half the designed minimum distance. This algorithm gets new syndromes recursively.

This generalizes the work of Feng and Rao <ref> [6] </ref> and Duursma [4, 5] from geometric Goppa codes to arbitrary linear codes. <p> Theorem 2.9 A code in a sequence of codes which has an error-correcting array has a decoding algorithm of complexity O (n 3 ) which corrects up to half the Feng-Rao bound, where n is the word length of the code. Proof: First we introduce some definitions, see <ref> [6, 7, 8] </ref>. Let S be a u fi v-matrix with entries S i;j ; 1 i u; 1 j v. Let S (i; j) be the i fi j-matrix with entries S i 0 ;j 0 ; 1 i 0 i; 1 j 0 j. <p> Finaly C 1 = 0, by Condition (6), so we have found the error e of the received word, since y l = e. We leave the estimate on the complexity to the reader or refer to <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 Remark 2.10 1) If we have an array for a sequence of codes (C r ) r2N and C 1 6= 0, then we still could decode in case we have a decoding algorithm for C 1 . <p> Proof: This follows from Theorems 2.9 and 3.4. 2 Remark 3.6 In the papers of Feng and Rao <ref> [6, 7] </ref> only codes of the form C (D; mP ) are considered, so there it suffices to take U i = V i .

Reference-contexts: We call ffi F R (r) the Feng-Rao designed minimum distance of the code C r with respect to the array of codes, and we abbreviate it by ffi r . Remark 2.3 1) Lausten <ref> [22] </ref> showed that the apparently stronger Condition (5) was tacitly assumed in [29] instead of Condition (4). Remark that r (i; j) is increasing by definition, that is if i i 0 and j j 0 , then r (i; j) r (i 0 ; j 0 ). <p> Condition (5) says that r (i; j) is strictly increasing. Assume the Conditions (1); (2) and (3). It is easy to show that Condition (5) implies (4). It is somewhat more involved to show that Condition (4) implies (5), but it is still straightforward linear algebra, see <ref> [22, Lemma 7.2.1] </ref>. 2) In the original definition of an array of codes [29], the F q -algebra K and F n q were the 3 same.

Reference-contexts: Example 7.4 Hermitian codes have been studied extensively and the true minimum distance was determined by Kumar and Yang in [21]. These results were proved for a larger class of codes on curves by Johnsen, Manshadi and Monzavi [19] and Miura and Kamiya <ref> [23, 24] </ref>. Let F = F q 2 (x; y) be the function field defined by the equation y q + y = x q+1 over F q 2 . There are q 3 + 1 places of degree one on F . <p> If a b, 23 then this minimum is (q a)q, and d (C r ) (q a)q. These lower bounds correspond exactly to the results on the minimum distance for the Hermitian codes given in <ref> [19, 21, 23, 24] </ref> for ae r+1 2 [0; 2l g ] and show that the FR bound is sharp. The bound for the generalized weights given by Theorem 2.8 are tight for Hermitian codes.

Reference-contexts: The equivalence of the first three conditions is immediate from the Remark 3:2 and the Theorem of Riemann-Roch. The equivalence of the third and fourth condition is proved for curves in affine three space and over an algebraically closed field by Murthy and Towber <ref> [25] </ref> using a result of Serre [34]. See also Herzog and Kunz [17] and Sathaye [33]. <p> The restriction to three space was removed by the proof of Serre's conjecture by Quillen and Suslin that every projective module over k [X 1 ; : : : X n ] is free, where k is a field, as was also noted in a footnote of <ref> [25] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore it was noted in [7] that majority voting often decodes beyond half the Goppa designed minimum distance. In this way a new bound for the minimum distance of one point AG codes was obtained. We generalized this work to arbitrary linear codes in <ref> [29] </ref> by the concepts of an array of codes and an error-correcting array. For a sequence of codes which has an error-correcting array we defined the so called Feng-Rao bound for the minimum distance of these codes and an algorithm which decodes up to half this bound. <p> The semigroup in N 0 generated by a subset A is denoted by hAi. The number of elements of a set S is denoted by #S. 2 Arrays for a sequence of codes The following definition is slightly more general than in <ref> [29] </ref>. 2 Definition 2.1 Consider F n q with the multiplication fl as an F q -algebra. Let K be an F q -algebra. Let ' : K ! F n q be a morphism of F q -algebras. <p> We call ffi F R (r) the Feng-Rao designed minimum distance of the code C r with respect to the array of codes, and we abbreviate it by ffi r . Remark 2.3 1) Lausten [22] showed that the apparently stronger Condition (5) was tacitly assumed in <ref> [29] </ref> instead of Condition (4). Remark that r (i; j) is increasing by definition, that is if i i 0 and j j 0 , then r (i; j) r (i 0 ; j 0 ). Condition (5) says that r (i; j) is strictly increasing. <p> It is easy to show that Condition (5) implies (4). It is somewhat more involved to show that Condition (4) implies (5), but it is still straightforward linear algebra, see [22, Lemma 7.2.1]. 2) In the original definition of an array of codes <ref> [29] </ref>, the F q -algebra K and F n q were the 3 same. In order to get examples of arrays of algebraic-geometric codes in this way, see Example 2:4, one has to assume that the degree of the divisor G is sufficiently large. <p> We called ffi F R (r) a designed minimum distance. This is justified by the following theorem. Theorem 2.5 For an array of codes we have that d (C r ) ffi F R (r), for all r 2 N. Proof: See also <ref> [7, 29] </ref>. Choose f i 2 U i n U i1 and g j 2 V j n V j1 . <p> See <ref> [28, 29] </ref> for the definition of an error-correcting pair.

Reference-contexts: In case C w has a t-error-correcting array, then we have an efficient decoding algorithm which corrects all received words with at most t errors. 2) There are improvements on the complexity in special cases for codes from plane curves given by <ref> [9, 32] </ref>, but up to now there is no improvement on the complexity for a sequence of asymptotically good codes. 3 Error-correcting arrays for codes on curves In this section we give and investigate our main example: arrays for sequences of algebraic geometric codes.

To our knowledge the determination of such non-gap sequences is still an open problem. 13 4 Symmetric semigroups We now choose F = G = 0 in Example 3:3.

Reference-contexts: Combining the two inequalities involving the rank of S we get wt (y) n r , which is at least ffi r , by definition. Thus d (C r ) ffi r , and we have proved the theorem by induction. 2 Wei <ref> [37] </ref> has defined the notion of generalized weights of a linear code which is a generalization of the minimum distance. A simple observation leads to a bound for the r th generalized weight of C s in terms of ffi F R .

Reference-contexts: The bound for the generalized weights given by Theorem 2.8 are tight for Hermitian codes. This can be seen by comparing this bound with the results of Yang, Kumar and Stichtenoth <ref> [38] </ref>. Remark 7.5 From the above example one might get the wrong impression that the FR bound is always equal to the true minimum distance. This is not the case.
