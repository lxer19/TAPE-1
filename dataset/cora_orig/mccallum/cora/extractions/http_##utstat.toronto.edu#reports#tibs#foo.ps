Abstract: We describe the analysis of some matched pair binary data arising from a study designed to investigate whether cellular telephones are associated with automobile collisions. Conditional and random effects approaches to the problem are derived and compared. Driving intermittency is a potential confounder, and its effect is assessed by strategic choices of the control period, as well as by approximate and exact (simulation) methods.
