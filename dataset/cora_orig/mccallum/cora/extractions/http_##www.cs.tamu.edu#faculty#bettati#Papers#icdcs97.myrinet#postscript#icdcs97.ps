Abstract: Wormhole networks provide a very-high-speed communication medium that is well suited for a large number of bandwidth demanding applications. Unfortunately, the lack of buffering in the switches causes blocked packets to transiently monopolize arbitrary large portions of the network, thus making it difficult to give real-time guarantees when connections contend for communication links. We present an efficient, fully distributed admission control scheme for time-critical connections over wormhole networks. In comparison to a corresponding scheme, such a distributed scheme offers advantages in terms of scalability and easy integration into hybrid networks. We compare this scheme to a centralized algorithm in a suite of simulation experiments and show that its performance is encouraging.

Reference-contexts: Due to the increasing bandwidth requirements in a large number of applications (such as incorporation of uncompressed video streams in control loops for remote labora toring), a number of very-high speed networking technologies are currently under investigation for their applicability to support hard-real-time communication, such as ATM [2], FDDI <ref> [1] </ref>, HIPPI [3]. We are investigating the applicability of wormhole-routed network technologies for this class of applications. As exemplified by recently developed technology, wormhole-routed networks are a promising approach for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication for small and medium-sized networks.

Reference-contexts: The admission control component of the protocol must ensure that enough resources are available in the system so that a new connection can in fact be guaranteed the required performance. Such admission control protocols have been extensively studied for packet-switched networks <ref> [4, 9, 11, 12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This may affect a large number of packets over a large portion of the network. Proper connection management strategies and appropriate protocols must be devised that ensure that blocking of packets due to link contention is bounded. Zhao et. al <ref> [5] </ref> have developed a transmission-control scheme that regulates the rate of connections at the entrance to the network. <p> In this paper we propose a distributed admission control scheme with the following two objectives: 1. Exploit the concurrency available in the network. Not always do connections conflict for links. With appropriate routing, network utilizations that go far beyond the bounds described in <ref> [5] </ref> can be achieved. 2. The admission control scheme should be distributed and affect only the switches that are on the route of the connection. Node failures and network partitions are to affect the admission process only if they hap pen along the route of the connection. <p> By providing tighter bounds in the calculation of our calculated worst-case blocking times and appropriately modifying the protocol, we can improve the performance of the distributed algorithm as compared to the centralized scheme. Rate control at the sender host <ref> [5] </ref> is known to significantly improve the real-time performance of wormhole networks. We are currently studying how to use our current distributed algorithm as a framework to include and make use of information about rate control at the sender. This distributed scheme has a number of non-obvious benefits.

Second, guaranteeing timing requirements subsumes deadlock avoidance. Our scheme can therefore support a distributed, adaptive routing scheme, which in turn rely on our scheme to guarantee deadlock freedom.

Reference-contexts: This periodically discovers allocated, but unused resources ( due to connections torn down ), and makes them available to new connections. The only assumption we make about the switches in this work is that they serve waiting packets in a round-robin manner. There are current efforts (e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>) to study the benefits of special support for real-time traffic in wormhole-routed switches. We are currently investigating how such additional functionality (e.g. priorities for packets) affects the performance of our scheme. Substantial work is currently being done on host and switch supported multicasting over wormhole networks (e.g., [8]).

Reference-contexts: The algorithm rejects the new 2 The proofs to theorems are omitted here but are available in <ref> [13] </ref>. connection if (i) the performance requirements of C i can not be satisfied, or (ii) if the performance requirements of existing connections would be violated by accepting C i . If C i is accepted, the blocking guards along its route are updated appropriately. <p> We call R i;k the local residual time between the two ports. Updating the blocking guards means allocating residual time to links along the route of the new connection. The above formula trivially satisfies Condition 1. We show in <ref> [13] </ref> that the formula satisfies Condition 2 as well. The correctness of the admission control algorithm follows directly from the above theorems: On one side, it never accepts a connection whose packets may miss their deadlines. This is enforced by the acceptance test at the source. <p> This is enforced by comparing an upper bound on the blocking delay (B X i;k ) with blocking guards at the intermediate switches. Theorem 2 states that this test is sufficient. We show in <ref> [13] </ref> that the algorithm updates the blocking guards correctly to reflect the acceptance of C i . 4 The Distributed Admission Con trol Protocol The admission control algorithm described in Section 3 lends itself as basis for a distributed connection establishment protocol for real-time connections over wormhole networks. <p> Although we limit ourselves to a source-initiated, source-routed scenario, this scheme can be adapted to destination-initiated or adaptive routing schemes as well. In the following, we briefly describe the procedure. For a more detailed description, please refer to <ref> [13] </ref>. Pass 1 The HEC at the sender host sends an establish request message, which travels downstream to the destination processed by each SEC along the route.
