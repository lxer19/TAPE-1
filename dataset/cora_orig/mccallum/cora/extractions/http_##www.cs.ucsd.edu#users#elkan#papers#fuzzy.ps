Title: The Paradoxical Success of Fuzzy Logic

Abstract: Applications of fuzzy logic in heuristic control have been highly successful, but which aspects of fuzzy logic are essential to its practical usefulness? This paper shows that an apparently reasonable version of fuzzy logic collapses mathematically to two-valued logic. Moreover, there are few if any published reports of expert systems in real-world use that reason about uncertainty using fuzzy logic. It appears that the limitations of fuzzy logic have not been detrimental in control applications because current fuzzy controllers are far simpler than other knowledge-based systems. In the future, the technical limitations of fuzzy logic can be expected to become important in practice, and work on fuzzy controllers will also encounter several problems of scale already known for other knowledge-based systems.

Reference-contexts: The main disadvantage of model-based approaches, on the other hand, is that it is very difficult to construct sufficiently detailed and accurate models of complex systems. Moreover, the models constructed tend to be highly application-specific and not generalizable <ref> [ Bourne et al., 1991 ] </ref> . Many recent expert systems, therefore, are neither rule-based nor model-based in the standard way [ Hekmatpour and Elkan, 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: Human engineers or learning algorithms can do this tuning; neural network methods have been especially successful [ Keller and Tahani, 1992 ] . What the algorithms used for tuning fuzzy controllers themselves have in common is that they are gradient-descent hill-climbing algorithms that learn by local optimization <ref> [ Burkhardt and Bonissone, 1992 ] </ref> . * Last but not least, by definition fuzzy controllers use the operators of fuzzy logic. Typically minimum and maximum are used, as are explicit possibility distributions (usually trapezoidal), and some fuzzy implication operator.

Reference-contexts: It seems that most current applications of fuzzy logic could use other numerical rule-based formalisms instead, if a learning algorithm or a human tuned numerical values for those formalisms, as is customary when using fuzzy logic. A quote from the originator of fuzzy heuristic control is relevant here <ref> [ Mamdani and Sembi, 1980 ] </ref> : : : : it should be remarked that the work on process control using fuzzy logic was inspired as much by Waterman and his approach to rule based decision making as by Zadeh [1973] and his novel theory of fuzzy subsets.

There is a wide consensus that the techniques of traditional mathematical control theory are often inadequate.

Reference-contexts: For example, well-developed systems were presented by Sandewall [1989] and Collins and Michalski [1989]. To the extent that numerical factors can be tuned in these formalisms, they should be equally useful for constructing heuristic controllers. Indeed, at least one has already been so used <ref> [ Sammut and Michie, 1991 ] </ref> . 5 Recapitulating mainstream AI Several research groups are attempting to scale up systems based on fuzzy logic, and to lift the architectural limitations of current fuzzy controllers.

Reference-contexts: Rather, uncertainty of some sort is attached to them. Fuzzy logic is an attempt to capture valid patterns of reasoning about uncertainty. The notion is now well accepted that there exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance <ref> [ Smets, 1991 ] </ref> . However, there is still debate as to what types of uncertainty are captured by fuzzy logic.

Reference-contexts: It is however possible to carry through the proof of the theorem in many variant systems of fuzzy logic. In particular, the theorem remains true when negation is modeled by any operator in the Sugeno class <ref> [ Sugeno, 1977 ] </ref> , and when disjunction or conjunction are modeled by operators in the Yager classes [ Yager, 1980 ] . Of course, the last postulate of Definition 1 is the most controversial one.

Reference-contexts: In intuitive descriptions, fuzzy logic is often characterized as arising from the rejection of the law of excluded middle: the assertion A _ :A. Unfortunately, rejecting this law is not sufficient to avoid collapse to just two truth values. Intuitionistic logic <ref> [ van Dalen, 1983 ] </ref> rejects the law of excluded middle, but the formal system of Definition 1 still collapses when logical equivalence means intuitionistic equivalence. 2 Of course, collapse to two truth values is avoided when one only admits the equivalences generated by the operators minimum, maximum, and complement to <p> Many theoretical papers on using fuzzy logic in expert systems have been published (see the volume edited by 2 The Godel translations <ref> [ van Dalen, 1983; p. 172 ] </ref> of classically equivalent sentences are intu-itionistically equivalent. For any sentence, the first three postulates of Definition 1 make its degree of truth and the degree of truth of its Godel translation equal. Thus the proof in the appendix can be carried over directly.
