Abstract: For the successful application of innovative software engineering technologies in industry, the technologies have to evolve incrementally based on continuous feedback from practice. Experiences about their practical application have to be systematically collected and stored in corporate memories and reused in future software projects. This promotes the sharing of experiences across individuals and projects, the formulation of best practices and facilitates the successful application of tailored technologies in practice. This paper presents a case-based reasoning approach for capturing and reusing experiential knowledge on software measurement programs in industry. A representation structure for experiential measurement knowledge is described in detail and knowledge retrieval and acquisition techniques are presented.

Reference-contexts: Newly gathered experiences have to be continuously acquired and integrated into the available knowledge. Case-based reasoning <ref> [AP94] </ref> appears to be the optimal approach [ABG98,GAB98,Hen97] for the operationalization of an experience base in practice. The major advantages of CBR in this context are the similarity-based retrieval for primarily experiential knowledge and its continuous incremental learning as an integrated part of the reuse process.

Reference-contexts: In order to operationalize this learning from measurement experiences in industrial environments, corporate memories for the systematic acquisition and the organization wide communication of this experiential knowledge have to be built <ref> [BM96,KS96, BCR94] </ref>.

The main problems concerning the operationalization of the EF in practice are to capture experiences, to represent and store knowledge in a reusable form, and reuse efficiently and effectively this knowledge in future software projects.

Reference-contexts: The major advantages of CBR in this context are the similarity-based retrieval for primarily experiential knowledge and its continuous incremental learning as an integrated part of the reuse process. We demonstrate our approach by using the Goal/Question/Metric Paradigm (GQM) <ref> [BDR97, BW84] </ref> as an innovative technology for software engineering measurement. GQM is a goal-oriented measurement approach, which helps defining and implementing operational and measurable software improvement goals. It has been successfully applied in several companies [CEM96,BCG92], such as NASA-SEL, BOSCH, Digital, and Schlumberger.

Here, the objective is to facilitate the establishment of measurement programs in practice by reusing experiential knowledge. The following scenarios illustrate how this knowledge can be used in order to support the GQM approach.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies <ref> [CM96] </ref> have proposed that experiential knowledge [Nor93], in form of past memories, is an additional important source of knowledge which contributes to learning. Experiential knowledge guides responding new situations based on similar past experiences.
