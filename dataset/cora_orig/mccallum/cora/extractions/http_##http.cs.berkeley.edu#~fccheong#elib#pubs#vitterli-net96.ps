Abstract: In this paper, we study the tradeoffs involved in choosing the bit allocation in a multiresolution remote image retrieval system. Such a system uses a multiresolution image coding scheme so that a user accessing the database will first see a coarse version of the images and will be able to accept or discard a given image faster, without needing to receive all the image data. We formalize the problem of choosing the bit allocation (e.g., in the two resolution case, how many bits should be given to the coarse image and the additional information, respectively?) so that the overall delay in the query is minimized. We provide analytical methods to find the optimal solution under different configurations and show how a good choice of the bit allocation results in a significant reduction of the overall delay in the query (by up to a factor of two in some cases).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Consider a generic multiresolution (MR) remote image retrieval system (see <ref> [1] </ref> for an example of such a system). The multiresolution approach is already being used for commercial products (e.g. Kodak's Photo CD) and has also been proposed for retrieval of video [2]. <p> However here our concern is to study how the bit allocation among the successive image layers affects the overall system performance. As an example, in <ref> [1] </ref> arbitrary compression rates are chosen for the different resolutions: we point out that this choice can be made so that the system performance is optimized.

Users accessing the system will be searching for one or more images within those available in the remote database. The two main components of the system are an image database and a user interface which handles the communication resources transparently to the user.

Reference-contexts: We tackle the problem of assigning a number of bits to each of the image layers (i.e. in our example choosing ff) so that the performance of the image retrieval system is optimized. Note that in a typical bit allocation problem for an MR image coder <ref> [6, 7] </ref> the objective is to assign bits to each of the image layers to maximize the full quality and possibly to meet some intermediate quality objectives. However here our concern is to study how the bit allocation among the successive image layers affects the overall system performance.
