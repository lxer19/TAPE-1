Abstract: Elmore delay has been extensively used for interconnect delay estimation because its simplicity of evaluation makes it appropriate for layout design. However, since Elmore delay does not take into account the effect of inductance, the discrepancy between actual delay and Elmore delay becomes significant for long RLC transmission lines, such as for MCM and PCB interconnects. We describe a simple two-pole based analytic delay model that estimates arbitrary threshold delays for RLC lines when the response is non-monotone; our model is far more accurate than the Elmore model. We also describe an application of our model for controlling response undershoot/overshoot and for the reduction of interconnect delay through constraints on the moments.

Reference-contexts: Note that all of these approaches assume that the response is monotone (or overdamped) in deriving their respective delay models. However, for long lines with sufficient inductive impedance the response will be non-monotone. For RLC lines, which are the necessary representation of interconnects whose inductive impedance cannot be neglected <ref> [8] </ref>, Elmore and other first-order delay models cannot accurately estimate signal delay because they are independent of inductance. To illustrate the effect of inductive impedance on the response, we consider a 2-port model for an interconnect driven by a step input with finite source impedance.

Reference-contexts: However, if the driver impedance Z S is just smaller than the characteristic impedance of the line, the voltage response will have a small amount of ringing: this can be advantageous in that the threshold delay will decrease <ref> [19] </ref>. The problem with ringing is that it can cause false switching if the voltage response drops back below the threshold; hence, the advantages of ringing can be exploited only if the maximum oscillation (overshoot or undershoot) is bounded such that false switching does not occur. <p> As expected, the delay increases for a strong undershoot requirement, and in general the delay increases if ringing in the response is suppressed <ref> [19] </ref>. The above constraint between ff and fi to reduce the undershoot in the response could be applied with the delay model in Equation (7) to perform delay-driven routing tree synthesis.
