Reference-contexts: In contrast to the approach used by other PDAs, most PARCTAB applications run on remote hosts and therefore depend on reliable communication through the IR network. The infrastructure provides reliability as well as uninterrupted service when a PARCTAB moves from cell to cell. The PARCTAB and a supporting infrastructure <ref> [1, 4] </ref> has been operational since March 1993 at the Computer Science Lab at Xerox PARC. The system currently comprises thirty cells and twenty-five PARCTABs and will expand in the near future. There are three types of software components in the PARCTAB system: gateways, agents, and applications.

Reference-contexts: The tab can be used as a general purpose, programmable remote control. In one research project the tab is used to control lights and temperature for the current location. <ref> [2] </ref>. * Calendar. The calendar application provides a tab interface to Sun's calendar manager program. A user may view and modify appointments while away from their workstation. * Weather. The weather application is an example of the tab accessing time dependent information.

Reference-contexts: This section describes a few representative applications that have been implemented. * Birddog. A reverse pager application that reports peoples location from active badge sightings <ref> [3] </ref>. * Dictionary & Thesaurus. Allows accessing a large dictionary and thesaurus. It would be difficult to store this amount of information onto a device the size of the tab. * Responsive environment control. The tab can be used as a general purpose, programmable remote control.
