Title: Visual Web Surfing with Hy

Abstract: In this paper we describe how we are using the Hy + visualization system to visualize the portion of the World Wide Web explored during a browsing session. As the user browses, the Web browser communicates the URL and title of each document fetched as well as all the anchors contained in the document. Hy + displays graphically the history of the navigation and multiple views of the structure of that portion of the Web. Queries of the visual query language GraphLog can be issued at any time to query and reformat the visualizations.

Reference-contexts: In the hope of addressing this problem, we have modified and interfaced one of the Web browsers, Mosaic 2.0, with the Hy + visualization system. Hy + supports the graphical presentation and visual querying of structured data <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref>. In this context, it displays several overviews of the visited portion of the Web as well as a graphical view of the navigation. The need for such overviews of Web browsing sessions is discussed in [7]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. <p> In Section 6 we discuss related work and we conclude in Section 7. 2 Interface of Hy + with a Web Browser The Hy + visualization system supports the visual presentation of structured data in the form of hygraphs <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref>. It provides a number of browsers and graphical editors to display and create the graphical presentations and extensively uses color and icon symbols to improve the generated visualizations. In addition, it has a layout engine that implements several different layout algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it has a layout engine that implements several different layout algorithms. Most important, Hy + supports a visual query language, called GraphLog <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, which allows the specification of queries graphically. GraphLog queries serve a two-fold purpose. They allow the systematic filtering of the data to manage the visual complexity of large datasets, and they allow the specification of new relationships among the data, in much the same way database views do.

Reference-contexts: However, as the session progresses, the user may quickly get out of context. During a session, it may be difficult to know exactly where in the Web the user is and how he or she got there <ref> [6] </ref>. It is difficult to detect if a place has been visited more than once or even to quickly return to an arbitrary place visited before.

In Section 2 we discuss the interface of Hy + with a modified version of Mosaic 2.0. Different Hy + views of the browsed portion of the Web are described in Section 3. <p> The system that to some extent deals with the same problem to the one discussed here is the KJ-Editor developed by a collaboration of the Toyohashi University of Technology and Keio University in Japan <ref> [7] </ref>. With the KJ-Editor, the user can construct an overview diagram of the Web. This diagram is constructed by the user, who for each page visited in the Web browser, decides whether to add it to the overview [7]. <p> collaboration of the Toyohashi University of Technology and Keio University in Japan <ref> [7] </ref>.

Webspace, which is being developed at the Geometry Center of the University of Min-nesota, is a tool that visualizes the hypertext links between HTML documents. However, it does not visualize the sub-web seen by the user during a browsing session.

Reference-contexts: It starts with a URL and constructs a map of hypertext links up to a certain depth. It uses an interactive tool (popularly termed robot) to fetch Web documents. Clicking on a node in the view fetches the associated document, as in our views.
