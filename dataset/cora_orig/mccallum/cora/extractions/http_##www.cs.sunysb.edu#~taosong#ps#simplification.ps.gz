Abstract: We present a simple, robust, and practical method for object simplification for applications where gradual elimination of high frequency details is desired. This is accomplished by sampling and low-pass filtering the object into multi-resolution volume buffers and applying the marching cubes algorithm to generate a multi-resolution triangle-mesh hierarchy. Our method simplifies the genus of objects and can also help existing object simplification algorithms achieve better results. At each level of detail a multi-layered mesh can be used for an optional and efficient antialiased rendering.
