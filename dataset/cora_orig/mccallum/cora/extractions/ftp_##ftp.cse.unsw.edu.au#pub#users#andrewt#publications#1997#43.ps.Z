Abstract: Various forms of non-monotonic reasoning thrive on minimal change in some form or other. In general, the principle of minimal change prescribes choosing the best from a given set of alternatives. A dual of this principle, which has not drawn much attention from the researchers in the field, is to reject the worst from a given set of alternatives instead. This paper explores the use of this principle in the context of belief revision, which has known connections with plausible reasoning. For technical reasons, a slightly modified version of this principle is used in this paper. We show that the resulting belief revision operation fails to satisfy the Conditionalisation principle, although it satisfies various weaker versions of it. It however continues to satisfy Rational Monotony. Apart from arguing that the suggested operation is not excessively weak, we provide a set of revision postulates that demonstrably characterises this non minimal belief revision operation. sense reasoning will lead to fruitful results.

Reference-contexts: Models are eliminated in a principled, systematic manner. The principle of minimal change (minimality principle) is one of the principles used to carry out such systematic model elimination. The minimality principle manifests in different forms in different approaches to reasoning. In the belief revision framework <ref> [3, 1] </ref>, the reasoner, after receiving the evidence, entertains as serious possibilities only those models that are, among the models that satisfy the evidence, minimally different/distant from the set of currently entertained models as a whole.

Reference-contexts: At the end of the day, the best setting is not necessarily the best of any of the factors: height, vertical linearity, and vertical hold. In fact, Robert Axelrod's computer tournament among strategies for playing the iterated game of Prisoners' Dilemma <ref> [2] </ref> shows that the strategy that pays off best in the long run is not the one that pays off best in a one-shot game. Tit for Tat, the strategy that beats all odds in this iterated game is almost a sure loser in a one-shot game.

The principle of minimal change (minimality principle) is one of the principles used to carry out such systematic model elimination. The minimality principle manifests in different forms in different approaches to reasoning.

We call any revision operation that satisfies the above eight constraints AGM rational. These postulates can actually be translated into constraints on a non-monotonic inference relation j~ [4]. Roughly, if K represents the background information, then xj~y may be taken to mean that y 2 K fl x . <p> Accordingly, as readers acquainted with the AGM construction of belief revision from belief contraction via the Levi Identity <ref> [3, x 3.6] </ref> will recognise, 2 fl as defined from v via Definition 2 is actually, in the AGM parlance, a partial meet belief revision operation. 1 Hence, by the well known results from the AGM literature (see Footnote 1) 2 fl will satisfy the (basic) AGM revision postulates (1fl)-(6fl).

Reference-contexts: We call any revision operation that satisfies the above eight constraints AGM rational. These postulates can actually be translated into constraints on a non-monotonic inference relation j~ <ref> [4] </ref>. Roughly, if K represents the background information, then xj~y may be taken to mean that y 2 K fl x . If so, then the postulate (7fl), for instance, corresponds to the principle of Conditionalisation in non-monotonic logics that if (x ^ y)j~z then xj~(y ! z).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, (8fl) translates to Rational Monotony that if x 6j~:y and xj~z then (x ^ y)j~z. There are various constructions of an AGM rational revision operation. The one we will follow is a semantic one propounded by Adam Grove <ref> [5] </ref>. Let M be the class of maximally consistent set M of sentences in the language in question. (We encourage the reader to think of these maximal sets as worlds or models. <p> It turns out that the AGM revision postulates characterise the Grove revision operation (see <ref> [5] </ref>). A visual representation of the Grove Construction is given in Figure 2. In this, the area marked [x] represents the models allowed by the evidence x. The area [K] represents the model currently entertained by the agent, and the broken circles demarcate models according to their perceived plausibility.

Reference-contexts: Most often one's preference gets more and more fine grained as one learns from the experience, and the experience comes with acting upon a rough and ready preference in the first place. This point may be illustrated by a concrete example from John Holland <ref> [6, p. 10] </ref>, The problem [of adaptation] is like the problem of adjusting the height, vertical linearity, and vertical hold, controls on a television set.

Reference-contexts: In the belief revision framework [3, 1], the reasoner, after receiving the evidence, entertains as serious possibilities only those models that are, among the models that satisfy the evidence, minimally different/distant from the set of currently entertained models as a whole. In belief updates <ref> [7] </ref> and action logics [11], on the other hand, after an action (a change) in the world has taken place, the agent judges a model to be possible if it is, among those that satisfy the post-condition of the action, minimally different from some model or other that is currently entertained

Reference-contexts: In normality semantics <ref> [12, 8] </ref>, on the other hand, all the models are graded in accordance with their (absolute) abnormality, and the reasoner, upon receiving some evidence, considers only those models that are minimally abnormal among those that satisfy the evidence.

Reference-contexts: We motivated this principle by appealing to the problem of iterated choice. Detail study of how our proposed approach deals with it is beyond the scope of this paper. In a sequel to this paper, however, we will replace AGM-expansion by abductive expansion <ref> [9] </ref> and show, how, our account can handle iterated abductive belief expansion (and revision). <p> Going through a concrete example, we argued that the weakening being suggested is not drastic. We also provided a set of postulates that completely characterise this non minimal belief revision operation. An interesting account of abductive belief revision has been recently proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>, which is actually an extension of the AGM approach. A shortcoming of this approach is that it makes no room for iterated abduction. We suggest that an abductive extension of our proposal can handle iterated abductive belief change. Research in that direction is currently being pursued.

Reference-contexts: The best horror movie is not, in general, the best movie. This non-monotonicity of choice leads to the non-monotonicity of the non-monotonic inference relation j~. In fact, minimality based belief change, viewed as a problem of choice, accords well with the established norms of rational choice theory (see <ref> [10] </ref> for a thorough investigation of this problem). Viewed from this angle, Grove's approach is one of preferential choice.
