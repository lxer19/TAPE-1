Abstract: This paper describes an experimental study of constraint-based network design. We used a novel network design tool, implemented in Java, to design representative networks joining major U.S. cities. The cost of three topologies: Best Star, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Delaunay Triangulation, are compared, with and without localized traffic constraints. The best star network gives near optimal result when the traffic is only constrained by source and sink capacity of switches (flat traffic constraints). With localized traffic constraints, the most cost effective network has a structure similar to the MST. The cheapest network has a tree structure when there are only flat traffic constraints, but can have cycles when localized traffic constraints are present.

Reference-contexts: Because of the lack of reliable data, such as distribution of bandwidth, holding times, size and behavior of multicast calls, and the difficulty of predicting future change, the classical telecommunication network planning techniques <ref> [1] </ref> are less relevant to this new generation of networks. A constraint-based network design model is proposed. It creates networks that can handle any combination of traffic that lies within user-specified constraints, is less sensitive to assumptions, and yields greater confidence in resulting designs.

Reference-contexts: Previous research on flat traffic constraints (the only constraint is that the traffic in and out of a switch cannot exceed the sink and source capacity of that switch) <ref> [2, 4, 3] </ref>, showed that when the link cost is linear to capacity, the problem of finding a minimum cost, nonblocking network is NP-Complete even for symmetric source and sink capacities. <p> This implies that tree structure is the least expensive, and it's proved that star is best among trees <ref> [2] </ref>, so the star network is almost the cheapest among all nonblocking networks. In the three cases studied, the closeness of the cost of the best star to the lower bound, also supports this observation.

When c is large enough that (u; v) ff u ; ! v , these constraints can be neglected. c is called the relaxation factor. Even the flat traffic constraint case is already proved to be NP-Complete <ref> [3] </ref>. Approximate algorithms can be used for designing nonblocking networks of provably small cost.

Reference-contexts: The Delaunay triangulation <ref> [5] </ref> can be useful in the design of nonblocking networks. The Delau-nay triangulation is closely related to the Voronoi diagram. Let P = fp 1 ; p 2 ; ; p n g be a set of points in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane. These are called the sites. <p> In link creation, some useful topologies, such as best star, minimum spanning tree (MST), De-launay triangulation <ref> [5] </ref> are provided. Best star returns a cheapest star network, so link capacities are also calculated. Delaunay triangulation is a useful topology in that it provides redundant routes between switches and is fail safe. The user can add, remove links by using the mouse.

Reference-contexts: The star network is best with flat traffic constraints. When traffic is localized, the MST is much better than the star. To design low cost networks, it is also important to minimize pathes between major nodes. To derive candidate link sets, topologies having more features, such as Euclidean spanner <ref> [6] </ref>, a spanning tree that simultaneously approximates a shortest-path tree and a minimum spanning tree [7] could be helpful. Looking at the pairings that are generated by the configuration for the lower bound and create network topologies start from the pathes connecting these pairs may be another approach.
