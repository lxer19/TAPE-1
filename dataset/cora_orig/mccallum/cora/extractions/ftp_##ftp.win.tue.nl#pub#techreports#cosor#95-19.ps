Abstract: We propose a mixed integer programming formulation for the delivery man problem and derive additional classes of valid inequalities. Computational results are presented for instances of the delivery man problem with time windows. In particular, the quality of the lower bounds obtained from the linear programming relaxation and the effectiveness of the additional inequalities in improving these bounds are studied.

Reference-contexts: This formulation can easily be adapted to the problem with time windows, i.e., when each customer has to be visited within a specified interval. Only a few papers deal with this kind of extension. Ascheuer <ref> [1] </ref> has developed a branch-and-cut code for the TSP with time windows. Escudero and Sciomachen [3] and Escudero, Guignard, and Malik [4] study the sequential ordering problem with time windows, where the sequential ordering problem is the problem of finding a minimum weight Hamiltonian path subject to precedence constraints. <p> Furthermore, p 0 = 0 and s i0 = 0. Observe that only in grid the matrices are symmetric. However, in both sets the travel times p ij satisfy the triangle inequality. Furthermore, for fixed i the value of p ij in the first set is in the interval <ref> [1; 38] </ref>, whereas in the second set this value only ranges from p i to p i + 4. Each of these two sets of matrices gave rise to six sets of five instances by the addition of time windows.

Reference-contexts: The sum of the waiting times is now P P It is evident that, apart from the objective function, the formulation for the DMPTW models the TSP with time windows as well. Compared to the well-known model with variables x ij and t i (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>), an important feature of the formulation presented here is that it does not involve big-M coefficients in the constraints. As mentioned before, the DMP can also be considered as a model for the single-machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent processing times.

In this section we briefly describe the steps of our cutting plane procedure.

Reference-contexts: We will restrict ourselves to the addition of SEC's, which have the following form: x (S) jSj 1; S ae f0; : : :; ng; 2 jSj n: The exact separation algorithm described in <ref> [10] </ref> is applied to check whether an LP-solution satisfies all SEC's. Violated SEC's found in this way are added to the formulation and the LP is solved again. This step is repeated until the LP-solution satisfies all SEC's.

We will briefly discuss the latter, using the terminology of the 3 DMP. Recall that for every solution to this problem the departure time equals the arrival time at any node but the depot. <p> Given an LP-solution ^ t, the separation problem for these inequalities amounts to checking whether (8) is violated for S = f (1); : : :; (i)g; 1 i n, where the permutation : V ! V satisfies ^ t (i) ^ t (i+1) (cf. <ref> [11] </ref>). Let us now give an outline of the separation algorithm for inequalities (12). Let (^x; ^ t) be the LP-solution and let the permutation : V ! V be such that ^ t (i) ^ t (i+1) .
