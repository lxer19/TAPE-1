Abstract: Previous papers from this reseach group have suggested that we group object boundaries not by tracking around the boundary but by pairing boundary points across the object. Such pairings can be used to compute the medial axis as described by Blum. In this paper, the results of a fuzzy (non-binary) operator sensitive to object boundaries are combined to create a response function of three variables: two spatial and one of scale. The value of this response function at any spatial position and scale is the likelihood of that spatial position being on the medial axis where the scale corresponds to the width of the object at that spatial position. These boundary-sensitive operators are applied at every spatial position and at a number of scales, and the results of these operators are combined using a technique similar to the Hough transform to produce the desired response function.
