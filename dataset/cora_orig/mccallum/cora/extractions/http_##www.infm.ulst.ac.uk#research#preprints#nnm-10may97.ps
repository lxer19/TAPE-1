Abstract: This paper describes a technique for detection of flaws in woven textile fabric, using Fourier transform spectral texture features. Two chief attributes make it a particularly suitable approach to this problem: because of the repetitive nature of the woven pattern, patterns can be expressed by very few spectral components (features), and, the whole detection system both the texture feature extractor and the subsequent decision mechanism have potential for parallel implementation via a feed-forward neural network structure. The technique also has potential for self-calibration, and hence a capability for adaptive operation. The performance of the technique is evaluated on a set of samples of denim fabric, containing real flaws. Constraints and trade-offs of practical implementation are discussed, including considerations of analog VLSI implementation of the neural network structure.

Reference-contexts: The implementation problem has been addressed, but less completely. Clearly the neural network structure is attractive for its potential speed; but its overall complexity causes concern.

Reference-contexts: These amplitude spectral components, along with their frequency indices, are sorted in descending order; i.e. we now can list the dominant frequency indices, which, according to the reasoning of section 3, identifies the best spectral features. Note: because of symmetry and redundancy in the DFT <ref> [19] </ref>, features occur mostly in pairs we simply reject one of each pair. (b) Apply the spectral feature extractor. Now we work on the full image, i.e. both normal and flawed parts.
