Abstract: This paper introduces two novel techniques for instantaneous speaker adaptation, reference speaker weighting and consistency modeling. An approach to hierarchical speaker clustering using gender and speaking rate as the clustering criteria is also presented. All three methods attempt to utilize the underlying within-speaker correlations that are present between the acoustic realizations of different phones. By accounting for these correlations a limited amount of adaptation data can be used to adapt the models of every phonetic acoustic model including those for phones which have not been observed in the adaptation data. In instantaneous adaptation experiments using the DARPA Resource Management corpus, a reduction in word error rate of 20% has been achieved using a combination of these new techniques.

Reference-contexts: Reliable methods exist for performing adaptation when a large amount of adaptation data is available. In particular, a solid mathematical formulation for the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) adaptation of mixture Gaussian model parameters has been derived and algorithms using this approach have been developed and refined <ref> [1] </ref>. Unfortunately, despite their solid mathematical bases, these standard methods exhibit slow adaptation rates when the amount of adaptation data is limited. To address this problem this paper focuses on the issues of rapid or instantaneous speaker adaptation.

Reference-contexts: To avoid these problems, the goal of rapid speaker adaptation is to quickly focus a speech recognizer's acoustic models onto the unknown yet constrained acoustic space occupied by the current speaker. SPEAKER CLUSTERING One method of speaker adaptation that has proven successful is hierarchical speaker clustering <ref> [2] </ref>. Hierarchical speaker clustering allows similar training speakers to be clustered to create models which represent specific speaker types. In our case, a very simple cluster tree is created in a supervised fashion.

Reference-contexts: The form of this interpolation is: p igd (~a j p) = p gd (~a j p) + (1 )p si (~a j p) (1) The value of is determined from the training data using deleted interpolation <ref> [3] </ref>. Similarly, the final gender and rate specific acoustic models for each phone are an interpolation of the maximum likelihood trained gender and rate specific model, the maximum likelihood trained gender specific model and the speaker independent model.

Reference-contexts: The top N hypotheses are then rescored using the consistency model. The value of N was set to 10 in our experiments. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Our various instantaneous adaptation methods were tested on the DARPA Resource Management (RM) corpus on the task of word recognition <ref> [4] </ref>. The experiments utilized the 109 speakers in the training and development sets for training purposes. The entire 1200 utterance test set was used for testing. Each test utterance was independently used for simultaneous adaptation and word recognition.

Reference-contexts: The entire 1200 utterance test set was used for testing. Each test utterance was independently used for simultaneous adaptation and word recognition. Recognition was performed by the SUMMIT recognition system using the standard RM word pair grammar and context independent acoustic models <ref> [5] </ref>. Our system was initially tested with standard speaker independent models (SI), gender dependent (GD) models, and gender and speaking rate dependent (GRD) models.
