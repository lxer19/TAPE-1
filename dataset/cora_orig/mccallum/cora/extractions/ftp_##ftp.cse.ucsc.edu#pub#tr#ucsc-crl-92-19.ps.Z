Title: Spectral K-Way Ratio-Cut Partitioning  
Date: May, 1992  
Address: Santa Cruz  
Affiliation: Computer Engineering Board of Studies University of California,  
Abstract: Part I: Preliminary Results Abstract Recent research on partitioning has focussed on the ratio-cut cost metric which maintains a balance between the sizes of the edges cut and the sizes of the partitions without fixing the size of the partitions a priori. Iterative approaches and spectral approaches to two-way ratio-cut partitioning have yielded higher quality partitioning results. In this paper we develop a spectral approach to multi-way ratio-cut partitioning which provides a generalization of the ratio-cut cost metric to k-way partitioning and a lower bound on this cost metric. Our approach uses Lanczos algorithm to find the k smallest eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of the Laplacian of the graph. The eigenvectors are used to construct an orthogonal projection to map a vertex (of the graph) in an n-dimensional space into a k-dimensional subspace. We exploit the (near) orthogonality of the projected points to effect high quality clustering of points in a k-dimensional subspace. An efficient algorithm is presented for coercing the points in the k-dimensional subspace into k-partitions. Advancement over the current work is evidenced by the results of experiments on the standard MCNC benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present a method for k-way partitioning based on spectral techniques by extending the techniques of Hagen and Kahng <ref> [1] </ref>. The k-way partition problem can be formulated as the search for a projection of n-dimensional space onto a k-dimensional subspace, mapping the n unit-vector basis (the n nodes of a graph) into k distinct points (the partitions) to minimize the weighted quadratic displacement. <p> In the case k = 2, since 1 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 we obtain 2 cost (P) = n E c which amounts to the result of Hagen and Kahng <ref> [1] </ref> 2 jP 1 j jP 2 j obviously not a tight upper bound for a graph with large number of nodes.

By Hall's result <ref> [4] </ref>, using the k eigenvectors of the graph's Laplacian, corresponding to the smallest k eigenvalues provides a projection which minimizes the weighted quadratic displacement under the orthonormality constraint. In the case of a partition, this amounts to the number of edges cut.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, in the case of k = 2, this is the ratio-cut metric defined by Cheng and Wei scaled by the number of nodes in the graph <ref> [5] </ref>. The sum of the smallest k eigenvalues provides a lower bound on this cost metric. A geometric interpretation of the eigenvectors provides a method for transforming the eigenvector solution into a partition. More significantly, this formulation provides a heuristic for identifying the natural number of partitions, k, a priori. <p> Observation 15 For a random graph with edge probability f , and any partition P of size k, scost (P) = f n n which is a generalization of results of Cheng and Wei for bipartition <ref> [5] </ref>. (We are not sure yet what this means, may be this is the average degree of the partition graph per partition. But it will result in k = n being selected, if the heuristics by eigenvalues estimation below is accurate).
