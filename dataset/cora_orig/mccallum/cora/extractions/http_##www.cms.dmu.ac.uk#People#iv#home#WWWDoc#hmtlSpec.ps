Abstract: This document is an Internet Draft. Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet Drafts. Internet Drafts are working documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress". Distribution of this document is unlimited. The document is a draft form of a standard for interchange of information on the network which is proposed to be registered as a MIME (RFC1341) content type. Please send comments to timbl@info.cern.ch or the discussion list www-talk@info.cern.ch. This is version 1.2 of this draft. This document is available in hypertext on the World-Wide Web as http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html Abstract * Database query results; The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links related information throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing linked information, and all W3 compatible programs are required to be capable of handling HTML. W3 uses an Internet protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer representations to be negotiated between client and server, the result being returned in an extended MIME message. HTML is therefore just one, but an important one, of the representations used with W3. HTML is proposed as a MIME content type. HTML refers to the URL specification of RFCxxxx. Implementations of HTML parsers and generators can be found in the various W3 servers and browsers, in the public domain W3 code, and may also be built using various public domain SGML parsers such as [SGMLS]. HTML is an SGML document type with fairly generic semantics appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications. It is more generic than many specific SGML applications, but is still completely device-independent.
