Abstract: Machine learning techniques are applicable to computer system optimization. We show that shared memory multiprocessors can successfully utilize machine learning algorithms for memory access pattern prediction. In particular three different on-line machine learning prediction techniques were tested to learn and predict repetitive memory access patterns for three typical parallel processing applications, the 2-D relaxation algorithm, matrix multiply and Fast Fourier Transform on a shared memory multiprocessor. The predictions were then used by a routing control algorithm to reduce control latency in the interconnection network by configuring the interconnection network to provide needed memory access paths before they were requested. Three trainable prediction techniques were used and tested: 1). a Markov predictor, 2). a linear predictor and 3). a time delay neural network (TDNN) predictor. Different predictors performed best on different applications, but the TDNN produced uniformly good results.
