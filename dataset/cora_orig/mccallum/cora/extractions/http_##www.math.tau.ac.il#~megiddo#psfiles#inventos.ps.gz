Title: Exact Computation of Optimal Inventory Policies over an Unbounded Horizon  
Author: Refael Hassin and Nimrod Megiddo 
Date: Revised; October 1989  
Abstract: An inventory scheduling model with forbidden time intervals is analyzed. The objective is to minimize the long-term average cost per time unit. Unlike most of the literature on inventory theory, no restrictive assumptions are made apriori about the nature of optimal solutions. It is rather proved that optimal policies exist, and that some of them are cyclic with cycles of a particular structure. It is then shown that such optimal polices can be computed and an algorithm is given.

Reference-contexts: Usually the models are stated precisely but the policies found are only approximately optimal or optimal only within a restricted class of policies which is more amenable for analysis (see, for example, <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] ). For example, many authors simply assume that there exists a cyclic optimal policy and set out to find a best cyclic one.
