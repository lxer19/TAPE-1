Abstract: In this lecture we finish the discussion of embeddings and multicommodity flow and introduce martingales. In the last lecture we discussed an algorithm (Bourgain, LLR) for embedding a finite metric space (X; d) in (R O(log 2 jXj) ; ` 1 ) with distortion O(log jXj). We will show that this distortion bound is tight using the connection (established last time) between embeddings and multicommodity flow. Consider a multicommodity flow network with k commodities. Suppose the ith commodity has source s i , sink t i , and demand D i . Each edge in the graph has capacity c e . Let f fl be the largest number such that we can route f fl D i units of flow from s i to t i for all i simultaneously without exceeding the capacity of any edge. For any partition (S; S) of the graph, let C(S; S) = P e2SfiS c e and D(S; S ) = P fi:s i and t i on opposite sidesg D i . We showed last time that Is this lower bound tight? We now construct an example to show that it is. Let G be a constant degree expander with n vertices; i.e., the maximum degree in G is bounded by a constant and every subset S with jSj n=2 has at least ffjSj edges connecting it to S. Since G has constant degree, it is easy to see that G has fi(n 2 ) pairs of vertices whose distance is fi(log n). Now define a flow network on G by giving every edge capacity 1, making every pair of distinct vertices a source-sink pair (so that k = n(n 1)), and letting all demands be 1. Observe that we have fi(n 2 ) pairs of vertices each with flow fi(log n), so the total flow along all edges in the graph is (n 2 log n). The total number of edges is fi(n), so by the capacity constraint we must have

Reference-contexts: Let X be the vertex exposure martingale of f . Adding or deleting one vertex cannot change the chromatic number by more than one (check this!). Hence jX i X i1 j 1 and Pr [jX E [X]j ] 2 exp 2n (17.9) (a result of Shamir and Spencer <ref> [SS87] </ref>). This implies that the chromatic number of a random graph G 2 G n;p is concentrated in an interval of width !(n) p n about its mean.
