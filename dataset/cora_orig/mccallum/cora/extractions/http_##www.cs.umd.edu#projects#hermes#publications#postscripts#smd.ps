Title: Secure Mediated Databases  
Author: K.S. Candan Sushil Jajodia V.S. Subrahmanian 
Affiliation: University of Maryland George Mason University University of Maryland  
Abstract: With the evolution of the information superhighway, there is now an immense amount of information available in a wide variety of databases. Furthermore, users often have the ability to access legacy software packages developed by external sources. However, sometimes both the information provided by a data source, as well as one or more of the functions available through a software package may be sensitive in such cases, organizations require that access by users be controlled. HERMES ("HEterogeneous Reasoning and MEdiator System") is a platform that has been developed at the University of Maryland within which mediators may be designed and implemented. HER-MES has already been used for a number of applications [7, 3]. In this paper, we will provide a formal model of security in mediated systems. We will then develop techniques that are sound and complete and respect security constraints of packages/databases participating in the mediated system. The security constraints described in this paper have been implemented we will describe the existing implementation.

Reference-contexts: Note that for simplicity, we restrict constraints to DCA-atoms of the form described above.

Various intelligent caching techniques to support this kind of query pro cessing [2].

Reference-contexts: If the officer knows of the implemented security policy, he may then conclude that Elena Sontag had a conviction on drug charges prior to 1990. This is a security violation. 2 The above problem is easily avoided by applying a technique similar to the well-known query modification <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> In this paper, we have defined the notion of a secure answer to a query. The key function of a secure mediated system is to provide secure answers to the user. We use the technique of query modification <ref> [12] </ref>, augmented with other techniques, to implement the principle of cautious cooperation within HERMES. The HERMES system already has a methodology for processing queries that is sound and complete w.r.t. the standard semantics of such systems defined in terms of the j= relation introduced earlier that specifies what is true.
