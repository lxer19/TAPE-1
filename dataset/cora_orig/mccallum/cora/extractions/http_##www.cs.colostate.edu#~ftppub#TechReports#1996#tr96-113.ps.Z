Reference-contexts: It is to be noted that these graphs seem to be similar to butterfly network with wraparound <ref> [ABR90] </ref>. Note that Cube-Connected Cycles are also regular Cayley graphs, but the graphs T CN n in [VS96] have a higher vertex connectivity (hence higher fault tolerance) and it accommodates a larger number of nodes than cube-connected cycle graph for the same diameter.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Cayley graphs have drawn considerable interest in the recent past for designing interconnection networks because of many desirable properties like low diameter, low degree, high fault tolerance etc. Cayley graphs are based on permutation groups and include a large number of families of graphs, like star graphs <ref> [AK89, AK87] </ref>, hypercubes [BA84], pancake graphs [AK89, QAM94] and others [Sch91, DT92]. All Cayley graphs are regular, but almost none of the Cayley graphs studied so far offer constant node degree (where node degree does not change with size or dimension of the network).

Reference-contexts: An important related question is is a cycle of length N c, where N is the number of nodes in the graph and c is a constant, contained in the graph, in the presence of a single arbitrary faulty node.
