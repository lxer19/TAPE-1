Reference-contexts: (21) " allomorphy MORPH h FORM i 3.4 Limits of Pure FA Morphology Finite-state morphology has been criticized (i) for the strict finite-stateness of its handling of morphotactics (Sproat 1992, 43-66); (ii) for making little or no use of the notion of inflectional paradigms and inheritance relations between morphological classes <ref> (Cahill 1990) </ref>; and (iii) for its strict separation of phonology from morphology|i.e., standard two-level rules can only be sensitive to phonological contexts (including word and morpheme boundaries), and apply to all forms where these contexts hold. In fact, allomorphic variation is often "fossilized", having outlived its original phonological motivation.

Reference-contexts: This impedes the identification of particularly important predecessors, among whom nonetheless three stand out. First, Trost 1991's use of two-level morphology in combination with feature-based filters was an important impetus. Second, researchers at Edinburgh <ref> (Calder 1988, Bird 1992) </ref> first suggested using FDLs in phonological and morphological description, and Bird 1992 suggests describing FA in FDL (without showing how they might be so characterized, however|in particular, providing no FDL definition of what it means for an FA to accept a string).

Reference-contexts: The second specifies when lexical s is deleted (corresponds to surface ;). Two-level rules of this sort are then normally compiled into transducers <ref> (Dalrymple et al. 1987, p.35-45) </ref>. 3.3 FDL Specification of Two-Level Morphology Two-level descriptions of allomorphy can be specified in FDLs straightforwardly if we model not transducers, but rather two-level acceptors (of strings of symbol pairs), following Ritchie et al. 1992.

Reference-contexts: While allomorphy is normally described in finite automata (FA), morphotactics is generally described in syntax-oriented models, e.g., CFGs or feature-based grammars. The present paper describes both allomorphy and morphotactics in a feature-based language like that of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1987) </ref>. The technical kernel of the paper is a feature-based definition of FA. 1 While it is unsurprising that the languages defined by FA may also be defined by feature description languages (FDL), our reduction goes beyond this, showing how the FA themselves may be defined. <p> 1 ENDING 2 $1 8 : h+,s,ti _ 9 ; 7 7 5 SYNjLOCjHEADjAGR PER $1 f1 _ 2 _ 3g 3 7 7 7 7 7 This treatment provides a seamless interface to syntactic/semantic information, and helps realize the goal of representing all linguistic knowledge in a single formalism <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1987) </ref>. Nevertheless, the model lacks a treatment of allomorphy. <p> First, we prefer the generality of a system in which linguistic knowledge of all sorts may be expressed|at least as long as we do not sacrifice 11 Cf. Reinhard and Gibbon 1991 for another sort of DATR-based allomorphy 12 processing efficiency. This is an overarching goal of HPSG <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1987) </ref>| in which syntax and semantics is described in a feature formalism, and in which strides toward descriptions of morphotactics (Krieger 1993a, Riehemann 1993, Gerdemann 1993) and phonology (Bird 1992) have been taken. This work is the first to show how allomorphy may be described here.

Reference-contexts: The same argumentation holds for the union and complementation of FA. It has to be noted that the intersection and complementation of FA via unification do not work in general for FA with *-moves <ref> (Ritchie et al. 1992, 33-35) </ref>. This restriction is due to the fact, that the intersected FA must run "in sync" (Sproat 1992, 139-140). The following closure properties are demonstrated fairly directly. <p> the allomorphy constraint (18), which, together with the Acceptance Criterion (10), guarantees that the input obeys the constraints of the associated (initial states of the) FA. allomorphy MORPHjFORM 1 INPUT 1 Rules of the sort found in (14) can be directly compiled into FA acceptors over strings of symbol pairs <ref> (Ritchie et al. 1992, p.19) </ref>. Making use of the regular expression notation as templates (introduced in Section 2 above), (19-21) display a compilation of the first rule in (14). Here the composite rule is split up into three different constraints. <p> from the more general adjectival rule, but pursuing this here would take us somewhat afield. 11 4 Conclusions In this section we examine our proposal vis-a-vis others, suggest future directions, and provide a summary. 4.1 Comparison to other Work Computational morphology is a large and active field, as recent textbooks <ref> (Sproat 1992 and Ritchie et al. 1992) </ref> testify. This impedes the identification of particularly important predecessors, among whom nonetheless three stand out. First, Trost 1991's use of two-level morphology in combination with feature-based filters was an important impetus.

Reference-contexts: As a nice by-product of our encoding technique, we can show that unification, disjunction, and negation in the underlying feature logic directly correspond to the intersection, union, and complementation of FA. Note that this statement can be easily proved when assuming a classical set-theoretical semantics for feature structures <ref> (e.g., Smolka 1988) </ref>. To give the flavor of how this is accomplished, consider the two regular expressions L 1 = ab fl c and L 2 = a fl bc. We model them via six types, one for each state of the automata.

In general, two-level descriptions provide constraints on correspondences between underlying (lexical) and surface levels.

This impedes the identification of particularly important predecessors, among whom nonetheless three stand out. First, Trost 1991's use of two-level morphology in combination with feature-based filters was an important impetus. <p> Second, a compilation into genuine finite state models could be useful. Third, we are concerned that, in restricting ourselves thus far to acceptors over two-level alphabets, we may incur parsing problems, which a more direct approach through finite-state transducers can avoid <ref> (Sproat 1992, p.143) </ref>. See Ritchie et al. 1992, 19-33 for an approach to parsing using finite-state acceptors, however. 4.3 Summary This paper proposes a treatment of allomorphy formulated and processable in typed feature logic. There are several reasons for developing this approach to morphology.

See Krieger and Nerbonne 1992 for proposals for treating morpho-tactics in typed feature systems. <p> This division has long been recognized as problematic. One symptom of the problem is seen in the treatment of nonphonologically conditioned allomorphy, such as German umlaut, which <ref> (Trost 1990) </ref> correctly criticizes as ad hoc in finite-state morphology because the latter deals only in phonological (or graphemic) categories.

Reference-contexts: We describe inflection using a word-and-paradigm (WP) specification of morphotactics (Matthews 1972) and a two-level treatment of allomorphy (Koskenniemi 1983).

Krieger and Nerbonne 1992 propose an FDL-based WP treatment of inflection. The basic idea is to characterize all the elements of a paradigm as alternative specifications of abstract lexemes.
