Abstract: A method for incorporating anatomical MRI boundary side information into penalized maximum likelihood(PML) Emission Computed Tomography (ECT) image reconstructions using a set of averaged Gibbs weights was proposed in [6]. A quadratic penalty based on Gibbs weights was used to enforce smoothness constraints everywhere in the image except across the estimated boundary of ROI. In this methodology, a limiting form of the posterior distribution of the MRI boundary parameters was used to average the Gibbs weights obtained as in [10]. There is an improvement in performance over the method proposed in [10], when the variance of boundary estimates from the MRI data becomes significant. Here, we present the empirical performance analysis of the proposed method of averaged Gibbs weights.

Reference-contexts: Better estimates of the ROI can be obtained using high resolution imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed tomography (CT). In order to improve the resolution and to get a reliable estimate of uptake in ROI, many researchers (for example <ref> [5] </ref>) have proposed to use priors from MRI or CT images. The method proposed in [10, 11] incorporates anatomical MRI boundary information into penalized likelihood (PL) ECT image reconstructions. The PL uses a quadratic penalty term based on Gibbs weights obtained from the MRI prior.
