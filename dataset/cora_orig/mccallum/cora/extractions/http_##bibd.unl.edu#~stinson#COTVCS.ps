Abstract: A (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography scheme ((k; n)-threshold VCS, for short) is a method to encode a secret image SI into n shadow images called shares such that any k or more shares enable the "visual" recovery of the secret image, but by inspecting less that k share one cannot gain any information on the secret image. The "visual" recovery consists of xeroxing the shares onto transparencies, and then stacking them. Any k shares will reveal the secret image without any cryptographic computation. In this paper we analyze the contrast of the reconstructed image for (k; n)- threshold VCS. We define a canonical form for (k; n)-threshold VCS and we also provide a characterizazion of (k; n)-threshold VCS. We completely characterize contrast optimal (n 1; n)-threshold VCS in canonical form. Moreover, for n 4, we provide, a contrast optimal (3; n)-threshold VCS in canonical form. We first describe a family of (3; n)-threshold VCS achieving various values of

Droste [6] gave an algorithm to construct (k; n)-threshold visual cryptography schemes. <p> Actually, this is not a restriction at all. Indeed, in Section 2.1 of <ref> [1] </ref> is has been shown how to obtain, from an arbitrary (k; n)- threshold VCS, a VCS having the same parameters m, ff (m), and f (X; t X )g XP:jXj=k , with equally sized C 0 and C 1 . <p> Among these constructions there are a few having the property that all the columns of a given weight appear with the same multiplicity in the basis matrices (see, for instance, <ref> [11, 3, 1, 6, 5, 8, 15] </ref>). <p> Then, there exists a (k; n)-threshold VCS realized by using basis matrices having contrast ff. Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume that r = jC 0 j = jC 1 j (see Section 2.1 of <ref> [1] </ref>).

From Condition 2 of Definition 2.2 in <ref> [1] </ref>, for j = 0; : : : ; n, it has to be that w (S 0 [j]) = w (S 1 [j]). <p> Now, denote by ff (A) the contrast of the (2; n 1)-threshold VCS with basis matrices (A 0 ; A 1 ). Since by Corollary 3.7 m = 2w (S 0 <ref> [1] </ref>), then it is easy to see that the contrast ff of the scheme represented by (S 0 ; S 1 ) is equal to ff = 2 while the pixel expansion is equal to m = 2m 0 , where m 0 is the pixel expansion of the scheme having

Since for any even integer r and any integer m it holds that, see <ref> [7, pag. 166] </ref>, g X 2 j = 2 r ! then, m = 4 n ! On the other hand, if n is odd, then m = j=0 j = 2 j=0 2j : We begin by simplifying the sum as follows: b n j=0 2j = 4 c X <p> Therefore, we have to show that the numerator is non negative. To this aim we need some definitions and properties of combinatorial quantities (see <ref> [7, pag. 47-48] </ref>). For any integer s 0 24 and real x, the rising factorial power x s is defined as x s = x (x + 1) (x + s 1). The rising factorial power is strictly related to the Stirling numbers of first kind.
