Title: Abstract  
Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to present an approach on reconstruction of 3D objects from their 2D projections and calculation of their volume. As an application, the authors have developed a software system for the detection of the men's prostate from echographic images and on the modeling and calculation of its volume. In order to have a more accurate calculation of the prostates volume than the ellipsoid approximation given by the echographic equipment, we designed a software tool for the handling and management of digital images. The modeling procedure is mainly composed of three phases: a) acquisition of 2D echographic images; b) contour determination c) generation of a 3D model and volume computation.

Reference-contexts: But it is very expensive, as it would require an endorectal transducer on the echograph, or maybe a computer-tomograph. In <ref> [2] </ref>, the authors present an approach to a similar problem, modeling the prostate after the acquisition of a prostate section every millimeter, all the sections corresponding to parallel plans (fig. 3).

Reference-contexts: The (big) gap in the contour is determined by anatomical reasons, because of the presence of tissues with the same ultrasound reflecting features. Some other operators have been tried ([5], <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]), but with no better results. However, it has been noticed that the central part of the prostate has a lower (darker) gray level, and it is brighter at its edges (fig. 1). <p> Fig. 2 The central point of the prostate is indicated by the physician. This point is used afterwards as the reference point in the criterion described above. It is also used in the algorithm of region growing <ref> [6] </ref>, as the starting point. In this version of the algorithm, we start with the center of the prostate, including other points if they are neighbors of the region already scanned and if they satisfy a criterion, called acceptance criterion.
