Abstract: One of the most important traffic types in future packet-switched networks is high-bandwidth, variable-bit-rate (VBR) video. Since video is a delay-sensitive media, the network must allocate resources to maintain quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees on throughput, delay, and delay jitter to video connections. A key component of resource allocation is the traffic characterization of video sources that determines the resources required to support video connections. In this study, we propose a method for characterizing VBR video traffic with a fixed number of leaky buckets in networks with a deterministic service. We explore tradeoffs of network utilization in two directions: (1) the number of leaky buckets used for traffic characterization, and (2) the amount of information from a video sequence used to produce the characterization. We evaluate our method with a set of 30-minute long MPEG-compressed video traces.

Reference-contexts: constraint function for peak-rate allocation is given as follows: A peak (t) = t (12) (b) Dual bucket: The dual bucket scheme uses a 2-level leaky bucket that enforces both the peak rate 0 and the average rate 1 of a video connection as specified by the ATM Forum in <ref> [1] </ref>. The peak rate is policed with a cell-spacer that ensures a maximum rate 0 , while a leaky bucket mechanism ( 1 ; 1 ) enforces the average rate 1 of the connection.

Reference-contexts: We refer to the tightest traffic constraint function for a given traffic source is its empirical envelope, denoted by E fl <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (1), E fl (t) A fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 10]: <p> fl <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (1), E fl (t) A fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [2, 10]: E (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t &gt; 0 (5) It follows from equation (5) that E fl is subadditive. We next review a method from [10] for obtaining the empirical envelope for a given video sequence.

Reference-contexts: Since stochastic characterizations do not provide a worst-case bound on the traffic arrivals on a connection, they are inappropriate for use in a deterministic network.

Reference-contexts: An upper bound A fl on A is called a traffic constraint function for A if for all times t 0 and t 0 the following holds <ref> [4] </ref>: A [t; t + t] A (t) (1) Note that A fl is by construction a time-invariant bound of A, i.e., A fl (t) provides a bound on the maximum traffic arrivals from any interval of length t. <p> function to be subadditive, that is, A fl must satisfy the following equation: A (t 1 + t 2 ) A (t 1 ) + A (t 2 ) 8t 1 ; t 2 0 (2) Traffic constraint functions will be used in admission control tests that require subadditive functions <ref> [4, 11, 13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The choice of traffic characterization is a tradeoff between the high accuracy preferred by admission control tests and the simplicity required for implementing policing mechanisms. Many traffic characterizations for VBR video have been proposed in the literature. Several studies (see <ref> [7] </ref> for a recent survey) characterize VBR video traffic with stochastic processes that capture both the distribution of number of bits per frame as well as the autocorrelation function of VBR video sequences.

Reference-contexts: Parameters are selected based on some subset of the empirical envelope as discussed above. We evaluate the effectiveness of our heuristic as compared to other approaches from the literature using a number of video segments coded with the MPEG compression algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In x2 we review deterministic traffic characterizations of VBR video traffic and discuss the notion of the empirical envelope. In x3 we investigate the amount of information necessary to accurately characterize a VBR video sequence.

A peak-rate characterization is determined by a single rate parameter that corresponds with the peak rate of the connection. <p> For the dual-bucket scheme, the traffic constraint function is given by: A db (t) = minf 0 t ; 1 + 1 tg (13) (c) Concave hull <ref> [10] </ref>: Similar to the heuristic algorithm presented in this paper, the concave hull approach selects a number m of leaky bucket parameters to characterize the traffic on a video sequence. The parameters are taken directly from the concave hull of the empirical envelope.
