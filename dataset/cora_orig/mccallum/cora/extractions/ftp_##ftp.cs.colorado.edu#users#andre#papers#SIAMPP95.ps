Title: Chapter 1 A Parallel Global Optimization Method for Solving Molecular Cluster and Polymer Conformation Problems  
Author: Richard H. Byrd, Elizabeth Eskow, Andre van der Hoek, Robert B. Schnabel Klaas P. B. Oldenkamp 
Abstract: Identifying the conformations that a molecular cluster or polymer assumes in nature is an important problem with many practical applications in biology and medicine. It is believed that the naturally occurring molecular conformations minimize or nearly minimize the potential energy of the molecular cluster or polymer. The problem of finding the molecular configuration(s) with the lowest potential energy is a challenging global optimization problem with a potentially huge number of local solutions over a very large parameter space. We have developed a method to solve these types of problems, and have experimented with both molecular cluster and polymer applications, with very promising results. We have implemented the method on powerful massively parallel computers because of the enormous computational requirements of solving these types of problems. The parallel algorithms are interesting asynchronous, multi-level parallel algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The polymer problem we are working on initially is the protein polyalanine, using the CHARMM energy function to compute the potential energy <ref> [1] </ref>. This function is the sum of internal energy terms for bonded atoms plus nonbonded interactions. The internal energy terms include the bond potential, bond angle potential and dihedral angle potential for both proper and improper dihedral angles.

Reference-contexts: A third area for possibly decreasing costs is to make use of a "smoothed" potential energy function that should have fewer local minimizers than the original problem <ref> [7] </ref>. The goal would be to use the global minimizer (s) of the smoothed function as starting points for consecutively less smoothed problems. Finally, our future work will continue to attempt to solve larger and more difficult problems within the application area of polymers and proteins.

We have obtained many configurations with significantly lower energies than those obtained in [9].

Reference-contexts: The method combines an initial phase that locates a beginning set of low minimizers, with a second, more deterministic phase for progressing from low to even lower local minimizers. The initial phase is derived in part from previous stochastic methods based on the work of <ref> [11] </ref>. For the cluster problem, random clusters are generated by sampling molecule locations independently over a 3 dimensional region. Then the best sample clusters are randomly perturbed, one molecule at a time, until the energy value reaches a desired threshold level.

For the polymer problem, the subset is a small number of dihedral angles; the techniques for making that choice are explained in <ref> [12] </ref>. Once the subset has been determined, a global optimization procedure is executed to find the best new positions for the chosen parameters while holding the remaining parameters fixed. The resulting configurations are then "polished" by applying a full dimensional local minimization using all the variables.
