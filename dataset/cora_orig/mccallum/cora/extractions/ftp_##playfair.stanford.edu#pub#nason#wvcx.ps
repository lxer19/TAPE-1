Abstract: This paper is about using wavelets for regression. The main aim of the paper is to introduce and develop a cross-validation method for selecting a wavelet regression threshold that produces good estimates with respect to L 2 error. The selected threshold determines which coefficients to keep in an orthogonal wavelet expansion of noisy data and acts in a similar way to a smoothing parameter in non-parametric regression. The paper gives a very brief introduction to wavelets and how the discrete wavelet transform with a thresholding rule can be used to estimate functions from noisy data. The paper examines the integrated square error (ISE) of a soft-thresholded wavelet estimator as a function of the threshold and shows that the ISE is almost always convex and almost always has negative first derivative for a zero threshold. This implies that it is almost always possible to find a unique minimum for the ISE. A cross-validation score is introduced to estimate the ISE of a soft-thresholded estimator. The score is based on splitting the data into two sets with one set consisting of odd-indexed observations and the other containing the even-indexed ones. Such a splitting is convenient because the discrete wavelet transform, which is involved in computing a regression, only operates on data sets containing a power of two number of data points. The theoretical behaviour of the cross-validation score as a function of the threshold is investigated and compared to the true ISE which it closely resembles. The penultimate part of this paper compares the cross-validation procedure with other threshold-choice methods for a three functions and three different noise structures. The comparisons suggest that for sparse signals the cross-validation method successfully estimates the `true' ISE and can outperform other methods.
