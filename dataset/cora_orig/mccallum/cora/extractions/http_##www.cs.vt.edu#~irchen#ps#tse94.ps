Title: Warm Standby in Hierarchically Structured Process-Control Programs  
Author: Ing-Ray Chen and Farokh B. Bastani 
Abstract: We classify standby redundancy design space in process-control programs into the following three categories: cold standby, warm standby, and hot standby. Design parameters of warm standby are identified and the reliability of a system using warm standby is evaluated and compared with that of hot standby. Our analysis indicates that the warm standby scheme is particularly suitable for long-lived unmaintainable systems, especially those operating in harsh environments where burst hardware failures are possible. The feasibility of warm standby is demonstrated with a simulated chemical batch reactor system. Index Terms | Fault tolerance, process-control, standby replacement, replication, knowledge representation, reliability assessment.

Reference-contexts: Let x i be 1 if p i is alive and let it be 0 if p i has failed, for i = 1,2,3,4. Let x i denote the complement of x i . Then the structure function for the system <ref> [3] </ref> is s (x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; x 4 ) = x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 + x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 + x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 + x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4

Reference-contexts: However, it also points out the importance of using partial copies to provide fault tolerance even a partial copy with seniority equal to 0.2 can make a significant difference. Our other experimental results <ref> [4] </ref> show that in all cases when at least one partial copy survives failures (for both the level 1 and level 2 processes), the yield of C B is good and the M SE is never more than 5 ffi F 2 .

Reference-contexts: We have developed a detailed reliability model <ref> [5] </ref> that assumes that when a partial copy of process a or process b takes 6 over, it takes an exponentially distributed time (this is the vulnerable period) with rate a or b , respectively, to become a primary copy. <p> Moreover, it models the fact that during this vulnerable period, there is a software failure rate, , representing the rate at which a partial copy fails to deal with a control task when it takes over. Detailed calculations <ref> [5] </ref> show that the reliability of the system using warm standby copies is better than that just using hot standby copies as (software failure rate of a partial copy) decreases and as (recovery rate of a partial copy) increases (here a = b = ).
