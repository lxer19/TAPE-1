Title: Integrating Robotic Research: A Survey of Robotic Wheelchair Development  
Author: Holly A. Yanco 
Address: 545 Technology Square, Room 705 Cambridge, MA 02139  
Affiliation: MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  
Abstract: The integration of solutions to small problems is necessary to solve larger ones. However, this integration does not need the consensus of the entire robotics community. Individual research groups can integrate the necessary pieces to build solutions for larger problems. Community-wide standardization may lead to research stagnation. To address the issues of integration, five of the many research efforts towards developing a robotic wheelchair are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Work is continuing on the ability to add maps to the system for commonly traveled areas. Tin Man systems have been purchased by several research groups, including the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab (see the next section on Wheelesley) and the University of Rochester <ref> (Bayliss et al. 1997) </ref>, resulting in increased research in the field of robotic wheelchairs with a fairly standardized platform.

Reference-contexts: The chair navigated using its vision routines with few modifications. KISS Institute for Practical Robotics: Tin Man II The goal of the Tin Man project is the development of a low-cost robotic wheelchair to aid people with impaired mobility <ref> (Miller & Slack 1995) </ref>. Miller and Slack point out that the focus for robotic wheelchairs, in contrast to the field of mobile robotics, is the human interface and cost issues. Two wheelchair prototypes were developed; Tin Man II is discussed here.

Reference-contexts: The chair can be controlled in its robotic mode by using a graphical user interface running on a Power-book or the joystick. To demonstrate the ease of customizing the graphical user interface, Wheelesley's interface has been modified for two access methods: an eye tracking system <ref> (Yanco & Gips 1997) </ref> and single switch scanning (Yanco & Gips 1998). In both cases, the adaptation of the interface took less than one hour. Work is continuing on automatic mode selection and the vision system for outdoor navigation.
