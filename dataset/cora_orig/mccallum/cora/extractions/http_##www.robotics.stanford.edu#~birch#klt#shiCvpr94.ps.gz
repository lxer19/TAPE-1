Abstract: No feature-based vision system can work unless good features can be identified and tracked from frame to frame. Although tracking itself is by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations. We test performance with several simulations and experiments.

Reference-contexts: We then linearize the resulting system by the truncated Taylor expansion J (Ax + d) = J (x) + g T (u) : (4) This yields (see <ref> [16] </ref>) the following linear 6 fi 6 system: T z = a (5) where z T = fi fl collects the entries of the deformation D and displacement d, the error vector a = W 2 6 6 6 xg x yg x g x 3 7 7 7 w dx <p> However, the correct affine change can be found by using equation 5 iteratively in a Newton-Raphson style minimization <ref> [16] </ref>. During tracking, the affine deformation D of the feature window is likely to be small, since motion between adjacent frames must be small in the first place for tracking to work at all. It is then safer to set D to the zero matrix.
