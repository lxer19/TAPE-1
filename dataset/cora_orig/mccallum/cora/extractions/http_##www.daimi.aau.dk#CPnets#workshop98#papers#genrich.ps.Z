Reference-contexts: PrT-nets introduced the notion of an individual value and variable into the theory of Petri nets. Hence certain basic transformations of the expressions annotating a PrT-net come in quite naturally; in particular, consistent substitution of individual variables. (For a complete set of equivalence transformations for PrT-nets, see <ref> [2] </ref>. Only very few of those, however, play a role in the sequel.). To do the S-invariant analysis symbolically I took a step further.

Reference-contexts: It presents a simple production schema consisting of several nested loops; it is denoted by in the sequel. It has been extracted from a more complex net system in the fleld of chemical engineering a recipe for batch process control <ref> [3] </ref> but it could as well have been derived from the transaction processing in a database system or the processing of work objects in a workow system or, just some piece of software.
