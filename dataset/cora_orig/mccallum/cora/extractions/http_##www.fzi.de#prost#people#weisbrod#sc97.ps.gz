Abstract: Over the last years fuzzy control has become a very popular and successful control paradigm. The basic idea of fuzzy control is to incorporate human expert knowledge. This expert knowledge is specified in a rule based manner on a high and granular level of abstraction. By using vague predicates a fuzzy rule base neglects useless details and concentrates on important relations. Following L.A. Zadeh's famous principle of incompatibility, this technique is most promising when applied to large and complex problems. Nevertheless, nowadays most fuzzy rule bases are small and represent simple knowledge. From our point of view this surprising and somewhat disappointing observation is due to a major lack of understanding how to handle a fuzzy rule base. In this paper we present a new theory for fuzzy reasoning. This theory is twofold. In general, a fuzzy rule base is both partially inconsistent and partially incomplete. This is the price to pay for abstraction and granularization. We show, that if a fuzzy rule base maximizes consistency at the cost of completenes, the well known possibilistic approach to fuzzy inference is the right choice. For a fuzzy rule base, that maximizes completeness at the cost of consistency, we derive a new type of inference called oe-reasoning. Together, both mechanisms form an embracing theory for fuzzy reasoning in general. We propose a combined approach to be applied in order to manage complex rule bases.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, ongoing work addresses the issue of measurement scales: Often it is not justified to regard the unit interval of membership degrees as an absolute scale, but only as an ordinary one <ref> (Turksen 1991) </ref>. To handle such situations we are working on the idea of ordinal degrees of possibility and ordinal degrees of support, where ordinal possibilities cover the interval [* ; 1] and ordinal degrees of support are enclosed in [0; * oe ].

Reference-contexts: This very popular and successful paradigm turns out to be a special application of oe-reasoning. So standard fuzzy control is no longer a purely heuristic approach but a sound and well funded mechanism based on the theory of oe-distributions. We have elaborated this remark in detail in <ref> (Weisbrod 1995a) </ref>. V Discussion of Both Reasoning Mechanisms So far, fuzzy rulebases are mostly very simple and single layered with no internal variables involved. There are just a few applications that apply fuzzy reasoning techniques to hierarchical, more complex rule bases. <p> Within the context of oe-reasoning, to get new information means to get new arguments in favour of distinct assumptions, i.e. with new information the corresponding oe-distribution gets bigger. In <ref> (Weisbrod 1995a) </ref> we show, that oe-distributions correspond to a special type of belief measure, just in the same way that possibility distributions correspond to possibility measures. From a fuzzy measure point of view, this means, that oe-distributions represent dissonant knowledge, whereas possibility distributions represent consonant knowledge. <p> And to assume a reliable or a communicative source of information means to postulate one of the two reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, with the theory of oe-reasoning we infer the most common fuzzy control mechanism, Mam-dani's standard fuzzy control (SFC) <ref> (Weisbrod 1995a) </ref>. This is a very important result, since, at least from 13 our point of view, the theoretical background of SFC was not very convincing.

This is, given a fuzzy rule base [ ~ A i ) ~ B i ] we can first calculate the corresponding possibilistic repre sentative, i.e. the meta rule ) x;y , to determine its degree of consistency.
