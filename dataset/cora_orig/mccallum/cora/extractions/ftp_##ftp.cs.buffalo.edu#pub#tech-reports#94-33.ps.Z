Reference-contexts: Local area networks such as Ethernet operate at 10 Mbps. Copper media can support transmission rates up to Gbps. On the other hand, the fiber has a potential bandwidth of the order of 25000 to 30000 Gbps <ref> [1] </ref>. Also, the fiber optic networks are characterized by orders of magnitude better error rate (bit error rate of 10 15 compared to 10 5 of previous networks) [2]. Other advantages of optic networks include smaller size, lighter weight, lower attenuation, electromagnetic isolation, and greater repeater spacing [2]. <p> The communications bottleneck has thus shifted from the transmission medium to the processing medium. This requires redesign of the network protocols to efficiently utilize the high speeds and low error rates. One technique to minimize the speed mismatch between processing and transmission is Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [1] </ref>. Multiple optical channels can be formed on a single fiber using this technique, where data can be simultaneously transmitted on different wavelengths on the same fiber. This is achieved using tunable transmitters and/or receivers at each network node. <p> This is achieved using tunable transmitters and/or receivers at each network node. Thus, it is possible to establish concurrent communication between more than one source-destination pair using a single fiber. The number of such channels is typically of the order of 20-30 channels <ref> [1] </ref>, but the feasibility of having more than 100 channels has been demonstrated [3]. Each of these channels operate closer to the maximum speed of the electronic processing units which is of the order of Gigabits per 2 CHAPTER 1. <p> Multiple channels, each operating at a rate that the interface electronics can sustain, are formed which eliminate the need that every node receive and process all network traffic as is usually the case with a single channel <ref> [1] </ref>. Each channel can be switched independently and operate at speeds closer to the electronic interface. WDM networks are established using tunable transmitters and/or receivers to switch between the multiple channels created on the single optical fiber. <p> WDM networks are established using tunable transmitters and/or receivers to switch between the multiple channels created on the single optical fiber. This dissertation considers the case of both single channel and multiple channel Broadcast-Select WDM networks <ref> [1] </ref> operating in a multiple access environment. 2.2.1 Optical Components WDM networks are established using wavelength tunable optical devices. The next sections briefly discuss the principles of wavelength tunable receivers and transmitters. This is followed by a discussion of optical fiber amplifiers including erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). <p> Fabry-Perot and Mach-Zehnder filters have been constructed where 30 channels have been separated with milli-second switching speed <ref> [1] </ref>. Active filters have either electro-optic or acousto-optic control. A filter bandwidth of 1 nm has been achieved with both approaches [23]. However, acousto-optic devices have a tuning range across the full 1.3 - 1.56 m range, while the electro-optic devices are limited to about 15 nm [23, 25]. <p> Acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTF) for WDM have been described in [24, 25, 28, 33]. AOTFs have advantages of broad tuning range, fast electronic tunability, narrow filter bandwidth, and multiple wavelength selectivity which make them preferable for WDM networks. An optical cross-connect based on AOTFs is described in <ref> [1, 25] </ref> and can be used to route signals on different wavelength channels independently among different optical 13 CHAPTER 2. PHOTONIC NETWORKS fibers in a WDM system. Tunable Transmitters Tunable laser diodes have been an area of active investigation and a summary may be found in [2, 34]. <p> This is followed by a discussion of multiple access protocols for a WDM star coupled network. 2.3.1 Network Classification WDM Networks have been classified using a variety of criterion based on their characteristics. Three classes of WDM networks are Wavelength Routing (WR), Broadcast-Select (BS) and Wavelength Switching (WS) <ref> [1] </ref>. In a WR network, the transmitted wavelength completely determines the path in the network. This needs wavelength selectable devices. A Broadcast-Select network is passive with no internal wavelength selectivity. Selectivity is achieved by using tunable transmitters and/or tunable receivers. <p> WMCH [75] and FHA [18] architectures are based on BS passive star-coupled configuration. This proposal considers a BS network operating in a multi-access environment. As mentioned above, BS networks can be classified as single-hop multiple access <ref> [1] </ref> or multi-hop virtual topology networks [61]. Single-hop networks: provide a direct path between source and destination without intermediate routing. Packets are transmitted on an all-optical path from source to destination. Multiple nodes can simultaneously access the medium. Single-hop networks require at 20 CHAPTER 2. <p> The node remains in state S 1 if (i) generated exactly one class A packet which was sent in the same cycle and no other node sent a reservation, or (ii) the node did not generate any packet and no other transmitted a reservation in the current cycle, so p <ref> [1; 1] </ref> = ( 1 + 1 ~(1 fl). 2. <p> The node moves to state S 2 if (i) the node generated two packets where the first is a class A packet and was sent in the same control cycle, and (ii) no other node has sent a reservation in the control cycle. The probability is p <ref> [1; 2] </ref> = 1 ~(1 fl). 3.

The node moves to state S 4 if (i) at least one other node has sent a reservation in the 126 CHAPTER 5. <p> PROTOCOLS FOR DSM ARCHITECTURE control cycle, and (ii) the node either generates no packet or generates one or more packets where the first packet is class A and sent in the same cycle. The probability is p <ref> [1; 4] </ref> = (1 )[ 1 ~(1 fl) + 1 ]. 5. <p> The node moves to S 5 or S 6 depending upon the number of packets generated where p <ref> [1; 5] </ref> = 1 (1 ~)(1 ) and p [1; 6] = 1 (1 ~)(1 ). 6. The node moves to state S 7 if exactly one class B packet was generated and its reservation was sent in the same cycle so p [1; 7] = 1 ~fl. 7. <p> The node moves to S 5 or S 6 depending upon the number of packets generated where p [1; 5] = 1 (1 ~)(1 ) and p <ref> [1; 6] </ref> = 1 (1 ~)(1 ). 6. The node moves to state S 7 if exactly one class B packet was generated and its reservation was sent in the same cycle so p [1; 7] = 1 ~fl. 7. <p> The node moves to state S 7 if exactly one class B packet was generated and its reservation was sent in the same cycle so p <ref> [1; 7] </ref> = 1 ~fl. 7. The transmitter moves from S 1 to S 8 if at least two packets were generated and the first packet was class B packet whose reservation was sent in the same cycle so p [1; 8] = 1 ~fl. <p> The transmitter moves from S 1 to S 8 if at least two packets were generated and the first packet was class B packet whose reservation was sent in the same cycle so p <ref> [1; 8] </ref> = 1 ~fl. The transitions from state S 2 are: 1. <p> The transitions from state S 2 are: 1. The process moves to state S 1 if the current packet was class A, no new packet was generated and no other node has sent a reservation during t 2 , so p <ref> [2; 1] </ref> = 2 (1 fl). 2. Node moves to state S 2 if current packet was class A, at least one new packet was generated and at least one node placed a reservation, p [2; 2] = (1 2 )(1 fl). 3. <p> This represents the node idle in the current data cycle and is entered if it has no backlogged packet. The process moves from state S 4 to state S 1 if no new packet was generated and p <ref> [4; 1] </ref> = 4 ; to state S 2 if one new packet is generated so p [4; 2] = 4 ; and to state S 3 if more than one packet is generated where p [4; 3] = 4 . <p> The sojourn time of states S 9 and S 10 is the residual wait in data cycle and t 9 = t 10 = C L D. The node moves from state S 9 to state S 1 if no packet was generated and p <ref> [9; 1] </ref> = 9 . It moves to state S 2 if exactly one packet was generated and p [9; 2] = 9 .

The electronic processing capability of the computers has not increased to meet the high speed of the communication medium. In conventional networks, electronic processing speed is faster than the transmission speed. <p> Typical networks would combine the advantages of both these approaches to increase system size. The improvements of optical amplifiers [2,15] have the potential of extending the system size of bus based networks, motivating their reconsideration. The bus with amplification has the capacity to support hundreds of nodes <ref> [2, 16] </ref>. However, the star was still shown to retain its excellent fanout relative to the bus with optical amplifiers. In addition to providing implicit node ordering, the bus is characterized by lower fiber but higher coupler requirements [17], and requires amplifiers even for a reasonable network size. <p> Fiber optics is characterized by very high bandwidth of the order of 25000 Gigabits of capacity at three 7 CHAPTER 2. PHOTONIC NETWORKS transmission bands (0.85, 1.3 and 1.55 m) <ref> [2] </ref>. Fiber optic networks are also characterized by bit error rates as low was 10 15 . The bottleneck in the network has now shifted to the electronic processing. Protocol and network design have to be reconsidered with reduced latency as one of the main goals. <p> The next sections briefly discuss the principles of wavelength tunable receivers and transmitters. This is followed by a discussion of optical fiber amplifiers including erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA). A complete discussion of this topic may be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. Tunable Receivers Wavelength selectivity can be achieved with either a coherent receiver, or a tunable receiver with direct detection. The first approach is more expensive, but has higher channel selectivity: channels can be placed closer together so a greater number of channels are formed in the tunable range. <p> A lower cost alternative is a tunable filter with direct detection. 12 CHAPTER 2. PHOTONIC NETWORKS The requirements for a tunable filter are <ref> [2] </ref>: (a) tunable range or the number of channels it can tune to, and the frequency selectivity of the response after tuning, (b) time required to tune from one channel to another, (c) attenuation, (d) controllability, (e) cost, (f) polarization independence and (g) size and power consumption. <p> PHOTONIC NETWORKS fibers in a WDM system. Tunable Transmitters Tunable laser diodes have been an area of active investigation and a summary may be found in <ref> [2, 34] </ref>. The ideal device is a single-frequency laser diode that can span up to the spectral width of 200 nm at 1.3 or 1.5 m and is rapidly tunable. <p> However, fiber doped amplifiers operate only in the 1.5 m band while laser diode amplifiers operate equally well in both the 1:3 15 CHAPTER 2. PHOTONIC NETWORKS and 1.5 m region. Amplifiers can play three basic roles in lightwave systems <ref> [2] </ref>: . The power amplifier to boost the output from a transmitter . The line amplifier placed between the transmitter and the receiver along the fiber . <p> The line amplifier placed between the transmitter and the receiver along the fiber . The receiver preamplifier to boost the incoming signal before receiver decoding Amplifier placement has a significant impact on the system power budget and has been studied in <ref> [2] </ref>. Two types of laser diode amplifiers are possible: Fabry-Perot amplifiers and traveling wave amplifiers. For network purposes, the traveling-wave amplifiers are more interesting because of their flatter overall gain spectrum and ease of control. Fiber doper amplifiers typically use erbium ions co-doped with alumina. <p> Power budget considerations for fiber optic networks [5] showed that the system size supported by the bus was very small whereas the star could support hundreds of nodes. The system sizes of bus and star networks with erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) have been studied in <ref> [2, 16] </ref> and the star was also shown to have better fanout for multi-channel systems. <p> A FUB network with an optimized number of amplifiers (Gain of 15 dB) and active reciprocal couplers was shown to have a fanout of over 400 nodes, whereas a star network with receiver pre-amplification was shown to support over 2000 nodes <ref> [2] </ref>. The star topology exhibits the following characteristics which make it a better alternative the bus topology: 1. System size limitations in terms of the optical power budget were compared in [5, 57] and the star-coupled configuration was shown to exhibit superior fanout characteristics over bus-based topologies. <p> Another topology widely studied for local networks is the bus topology. Poor power budget characteristics of bus based networks led to star being the primary topology choice for optic networks. However, the advent of optical fiber amplifiers in particular erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) <ref> [2] </ref> has renewed interest in bus topology. The next chapter examines different protocol choices for the bus and star WDM networks with photonic amplification. 77 Chapter 4 Star and Bus Topologies The design of local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN) is significantly impacted by the network topology. <p> STAR AND BUS TOPOLOGIES The improvements of optical amplifiers [2,15] have the potential of extending the system size of bus based networks, motivating their reconsideration.

The following paragraphs discuss design considerations for both topologies, in terms of cost, couplers, propagation delay, and fault tolerance. .

The number of amplifiers required and the placement of amplifiers on the bus have been considered in <ref> [2] </ref>. The star coupler is usually passive when no amplification is provided. Receiver pre-amplification and built-in star coupler amplification have been compared in [2] where the former was shown to provide better power budget. .

Reference-contexts: In the bus topology, nodes are connected by pair of unidirectional buses carrying data. Their is a linear ordering of the nodes based on the node positioning on the bus. The ring topology interconnects nodes in a circular fashion. Power budget considerations for fiber optic networks <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the system size supported by the bus was very small whereas the star could support hundreds of nodes. This led to research interest in the design of access protocols for star networks [6-13]. <p> The number of nodes attached to a multiple access channel is bound by the saturation traffic and the optical power budget.

System size limitations in terms of the optical power budget were compared in <ref> [5, 57] </ref> and the star-coupled configuration was shown to exhibit superior fanout characteristics over bus-based topologies. However, bus based networks have renewed interest due to recent developments on optic amplifiers. 2. Star-coupled networks have high fault-tolerance due to their passive nature and complete unity distance connectivity [57, 58]. <p> However, power budget considerations showed that the system size of the bus was severely limited while the star had excellent fanout and fault tolerance characteristics <ref> [5] </ref>. This was followed by extensive research towards development of star based networks. 78 CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: A typical control channel based MAC protocol for the multiple channel WDM network is designated as X/Y, where X and Y are implemented as the MAC protocols for the control and data channels respectively. Some combinations of such protocols introduced in <ref> [6] </ref> are A/A, SA/A, A/CSMA, CSMA/A. A discussion of control channel protocols for WDM networks may be found in [76]. Pre-Allocation Based: Unlike reservation based schemes, pre-allocation based protocols do not require a separate control channel. All channels are used for data transmission. <p> We have investigated the first approach because it is simpler and tunable transmitters are less expensive than tunable receivers. The idea of pre-allocation was initially considered in [9, 82, 83]. The reservation approach has attracted a lot of research attention as presented in <ref> [6, 76] </ref>. Reservation protocols promise greater flexibility in the availability of data channels. However, some protocols proposed link the number of channels to the number of nodes in the system [8,12]. The number of WDM channels that may be available theoretically may be as high as 100. <p> The node moves to S 5 or S 6 depending upon the number of packets generated where p [1; 5] = 1 (1 ~)(1 ) and p <ref> [1; 6] </ref> = 1 (1 ~)(1 ). 6. The node moves to state S 7 if exactly one class B packet was generated and its reservation was sent in the same cycle so p [1; 7] = 1 ~fl. 7. <p> The process moves from state S 5 to state S 2 with probability p [5; 2] = 5 and to state S 3 with probability p [5; 3] = 1 5 . The node always moves to state S 3 from S 6 so p <ref> [6; 3] </ref> = 1. States S 7 and S 8 represent the data transmission phase and the sojourn times are given by t 7 = t 8 = D. The expression for average delay D is given by Eqn. 5.8.

Reference-contexts: The latter approach requires coordination for the receiver to tune to the transmitter's home channel. We have investigated the first approach because it is simpler and tunable transmitters are less expensive than tunable receivers. The idea of pre-allocation was initially considered in <ref> [9, 82, 83] </ref>. The reservation approach has attracted a lot of research attention as presented in [6, 76]. Reservation protocols promise greater flexibility in the availability of data channels. However, some protocols proposed link the number of channels to the number of nodes in the system [8,12]. <p> States S 7 and S 8 represent the data transmission phase and the sojourn times are given by t 7 = t 8 = D.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2.5 (b) shows a system with a tunable transmitter and two receivers. There are various choices depending on the tunability of the receivers. One particular configuration uses one fixed receiver and one tunable receiver per node as studied in <ref> [10] </ref>. The protocol is based on a control channel. The fixed receiver remains tuned to the control channel. The transmitter first sends a control packet on the control channel followed by data on one of the other channels. <p> The node moves from state S 7 to state S 9 where p [7; 9] = 7 .

Reference-contexts: About ten reservation protocols based on Slotted Aloha and Reservation Aloha were proposed in <ref> [11] </ref>. The protocols operate with one control channel and C 1 data channels. The architecture is based on one tunable transmitter and one tunable receiver per node. The access mechanism is as follows. <p> At the end of control packet transmission, the data packet is transmitted. If a 73 CHAPTER 3. ACCESS PROTOCOLS FOR WDM STAR NETWORKS node attempts to transmit to a node currently receiving on another channel, the transmission is unsuccessful. This is termed receiver collision [76]. The analysis in <ref> [11] </ref> assumes infinite population and does not consider receiver collisions but are considered in the following analysis. Immediate feedback about the success of the transmitted packet is assumed and the packet is retransmitted till it is successful. <p> Time is slotted on control packet boundaries and data packet length is assumed to be L time slots. In this paper, we consider protocol 6 (P6) since it offers the best throughput-delay characteristics compared to other Slotted Aloha based protocols presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. Each channel with P6 has its own cycle of duration L + 1 slots.

Reference-contexts: This led to research interest in the design of access protocols for star networks [6-13]. WDM star networks can be configured as single-hop networks where each node can communicate directly with other nodes. Multi-hop networks impose a virtual topology such as Shufflenet on the physical star topology <ref> [14] </ref>. Multi-hop networks usually have a cost advantage over single-hop networks since the former does not require wavelength 3 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION tunable devices. Single-hop networks has the potential advantages of optical self-routing and all-optical communication between source and destination. This dissertation focuses on single-hop networks. <p> This needs wavelength selectable devices. A Broadcast-Select network is passive with no internal wavelength selectivity. Selectivity is achieved by using tunable transmitters and/or tunable receivers. BS network can be configured to provide optical multiple access channels [59, 60], or virtual point-to-point interconnection in the wavelength domain <ref> [14, 61-71] </ref>. Wavelength switching can be done in two ways: dynamically where WDM routing is changed in the network to switch from one path to another, or by wavelength conversion where a signal is transferred from one to another on an optical fiber. <p> Multi-hop networks: represent regular or irregular graph topologies implemented in the wavelength domain. In this case, a virtual topology is embedded on the physical star topology [61]. They require intermediate routing nodes and hence increasing packet latency due to electronic processing <ref> [14] </ref>. Multi-hop networks typically do not require wavelength tunable devices and have a potential cost-advantage over single-hop networks. However, the number of channels may be linked to the number of nodes limiting the system size [14]. It is possible to embed any virtual topology on the physical star topology. <p> They require intermediate routing nodes and hence increasing packet latency due to electronic processing <ref> [14] </ref>. Multi-hop networks typically do not require wavelength tunable devices and have a potential cost-advantage over single-hop networks. However, the number of channels may be linked to the number of nodes limiting the system size [14]. It is possible to embed any virtual topology on the physical star topology. This is achieved by setting the wavelengths of the transmitters and receivers of the nodes. For example, consider a set of 3 nodes interconnected using a physical star topology. <p> The following wavelength allocation establishes a virtual ring topology: Node T 1 T 2 R 1 R 2 1 1 2 4 5 1 5 6 2 3 The perfect shuffle implementation on a star topology is shown in Fig 2.3 and has been investigated in <ref> [14] </ref>. The performance of a multi-hop network is determined by its virtual topology. A summary of access protocols for single-hop and multiple-hop networks may be found in [76, 77]. 21 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: Typical networks would combine the advantages of both these approaches to increase system size. The improvements of optical amplifiers [2,15] have the potential of extending the system size of bus based networks, motivating their reconsideration. The bus with amplification has the capacity to support hundreds of nodes <ref> [2, 16] </ref>.

Source-destination pairs are determined based on their addresses and the current time slot as explained in <ref> [18] </ref>. Each node computes its assigned channel in each slot using an identical distributed algorithm ensuring conflict-free and fair access to the nodes. The cycle length in I-TDMA is fixed and is dependent only on the number of nodes in the system. <p> PROTOCOLS FOR DSM ARCHITECTURE 5.5 Performance Analysis This section compares the performance of FatMAC and I-TDMA for single-level and multi-level systems. The performance of I-TDMA has been studied through simulation and analytic models in <ref> [18] </ref>. The system parameters of interest are C, M , and the traffic generation rate. Other parameters include the number of levels (r), the fraction of class B packets (fl) and traffic fraction requiring level-i communication (p i ) where 1 i r.

Reference-contexts: However, the communication appears to the user and operating system as a shared memory reference. Cache coherence protocols (snooping or directory based) have to be provided to maintain cache consistency across all the processors <ref> [21] </ref>. The performance of the DSM organization and the cache coherence protocol is dependent on the media access protocol. Careful attention has to be devoted to the design of the access schemes in an effort to minimize latency and deliver the performance advantage to the application level. <p> Define fl as the fraction of Class B packets generated in the system. The distribution of packet types is determined both by the media access protocol and the cache coherency protocol. Cache coherency protocols for multiprocessor systems can be broadly classified as snoopy and directory based <ref> [21] </ref>. The write-invalidate and write-update consistency commands generate varying levels of cache control traffic. Snoopy cache protocols use some form 113 CHAPTER 5.

Reference-contexts: The session layer and other higher level protocols provide user-oriented services and are not of importance to this proposal and will not be discussed any further. The most commonly used transport and network layer protocols are the TCP/IP protocol suite <ref> [22] </ref>. The layering of protocols as described above imposes an enormous overhead on computer communication. A packet needs to be handled by least three different protocol layers. This results in huge overhead due to information exchange between functions operating at different layers and leads to high buffering requirements.

The unidirectional nature of the photonic bus establishes a physical ordering among the nodes which is exploited by the Demand Assignment Media Access (DAMA) protocols [53]. Fig. 2.2 (a) shows the singly folded unidirectional bus configuration (FUB). The FUB has two unidirectional sections the outbound bus for data transmission and the inbound bus for data reception. This configuration has been used in protocols including D-Net [54]. Fig. 2.2 (b) shows the doubly-folded unidirectional bus (DFUB). <p> A multiple access environment can be achieved through a variety of optical channel topologies <ref> [53] </ref> as shown in Fig. 2.2. Two main topologies studied for local networks are the bus and star. This chapter examines WDM star networks without photonic amplification. <p> It has been shown that large ratios of transmission time to propagation delay result in degraded performance <ref> [53] </ref>. Protocol design has to consider the impact of propagation delay on protocol performance and implementation. For example, light requires approximately 30 ms to propagate from New York to Los Angeles assuming light is traveling at about two-thirds of its maximum speed. <p> In particular, this chapter considers the star, dual bus and singly folded bus topologies. The bus topology has been favored for local network interconnection since degradation due to propagation delay can be reduced by taking advantage of the physical ordering <ref> [53] </ref>. However, power budget considerations showed that the system size of the bus was severely limited while the star had excellent fanout and fault tolerance characteristics [5]. This was followed by extensive research towards development of star based networks. 78 CHAPTER 4. <p> STAR AND BUS TOPOLOGIES 4.2 Access Arbitration Mechanisms The following section examines arbitration mechanisms for the topologies and describes the protocols used in the evaluation of the topologies. Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) schemes for the bus have been studied in <ref> [53] </ref>. Other approaches have since been proposed for bus-based networks. A TDM-based protocol referred to as AMTRAC has been studied in [102]. Fairnet is based on per node transmission probabilities and has been studied for the multi-channel domain [103].

Reference-contexts: WMCH [75] and FHA [18] architectures are based on BS passive star-coupled configuration. This proposal considers a BS network operating in a multi-access environment. As mentioned above, BS networks can be classified as single-hop multiple access [1] or multi-hop virtual topology networks <ref> [61] </ref>. Single-hop networks: provide a direct path between source and destination without intermediate routing. Packets are transmitted on an all-optical path from source to destination. Multiple nodes can simultaneously access the medium. Single-hop networks require at 20 CHAPTER 2. PHOTONIC NETWORKS least one tunable device to accomplish transmission. <p> Single-hop networks typically require at least one wavelength tunable device per node. Multi-hop networks: represent regular or irregular graph topologies implemented in the wavelength domain. In this case, a virtual topology is embedded on the physical star topology <ref> [61] </ref>. They require intermediate routing nodes and hence increasing packet latency due to electronic processing [14]. Multi-hop networks typically do not require wavelength tunable devices and have a potential cost-advantage over single-hop networks.

Reference-contexts: Wavelength switching can be done in two ways: dynamically where WDM routing is changed in the network to switch from one path to another, or by wavelength conversion where a signal is transferred from one to another on an optical fiber. WS devices based on AOTFs <ref> [25, 72] </ref> or wavelength converters [73,74] could be used to realize WS networks. WMCH [75] and FHA [18] architectures are based on BS passive star-coupled configuration. This proposal considers a BS network operating in a multi-access environment.

ACCESS PROTOCOLS FOR WDM STAR NETWORKS node attempts to transmit to a node currently receiving on another channel, the transmission is unsuccessful. This is termed receiver collision <ref> [76] </ref>. The analysis in [11] assumes infinite population and does not consider receiver collisions but are considered in the following analysis. Immediate feedback about the success of the transmitted packet is assumed and the packet is retransmitted till it is successful. <p> In multi-channel systems where devices can be fixed or tunable, the sense tap and receiver may be implemented separately.

The optical power budget (OPB) characteristics determine the number of nodes that can be connected in a network while maintaining a specified bit-error-rate. The number of nodes attached to a multiple access channel is bound by the saturation traffic and the optical power budget.

Reference-contexts: The objective of this section is to study latency reduction through alternate strategies for the reservation cycle. Slotted Aloha (SA) is the simplest random access scheme that provides low latency under light loads. SA based reservation access schemes have been widely studied for satellite communication systems <ref> [80] </ref>. The following section presents the various approaches using SA for satellite communication. This is followed by examining the applicability of these approaches to the WDM environment. An alternate approach using TDM scheduling based on scheduling theory has been studied in [120, 121].

Reference-contexts: The protocol usually defines a contention resolution mechanism in the event of a collision. Static access or non-contention based protocols pre-determine the time instants a node may access the network avoiding collisions. The simplest random access protocols are Aloha (A) and Slotted Aloha (SA) <ref> [81] </ref>. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a typical example of a static access protocol [81]. Performance evaluation of access schemes are usually based on packet delay (latency), channel utilization, and access fairness. Packet delay is the average time between packet generation at the source and reception at the destination. <p> Static access or non-contention based protocols pre-determine the time instants a node may access the network avoiding collisions. The simplest random access protocols are Aloha (A) and Slotted Aloha (SA) <ref> [81] </ref>. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is a typical example of a static access protocol [81]. Performance evaluation of access schemes are usually based on packet delay (latency), channel utilization, and access fairness. Packet delay is the average time between packet generation at the source and reception at the destination. Channel utilization is the fraction of time the network is utilized for useful data transmission. <p> Fig. 2.4 summarizes the delay-throughput of the two approaches. Other extensions to these two approaches include reservation-SA, reservation-TDMA, Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), contention tree protocol <ref> [81] </ref>. These protocols have performance characteristics that lie between these SA and TDM. <p> SA based protocols have a potential 36 CHAPTER 3. ACCESS PROTOCOLS FOR WDM STAR NETWORKS instability problem due to high collisions under heavy traffic. Stabilizing mechanisms have been studied for SA to eliminate network collapse and provide a steady throughput <ref> [81] </ref>. Acknowledgments required in I-SA make the protocol potentially variable to propagation delay. The following paragraphs discuss two different acknowledgment schemes for I-SA. Extended Acknowledgments: A packet slot in I-SA is composed of two phases with this approach referred as ESS [93]: data transmission phase and acknowledgment subslots. <p> The implementation details of the above two schemes and the performance analysis based on semi-markov and simulation models is presented in [93]. For a single channel network, the maximum utilization with SA for an infinite population system was analytically shown to be approximately 0.36 <ref> [81] </ref>. For a C channel system, theoretical throughput bound with I-SA is 0:36C. However, this was not observed in the studies mainly because of the finite population model, a single transmitter and head-of-line effect due to a single queue. <p> The following section describes the static access protocols studied for the star network. 3.2.2 Static Access Protocols Static access schemes pre-determine the time instants a node may access the data channel. An example of such a scheme is Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) <ref> [81] </ref>. Time is divided into slots and exactly one node is allocated channel access during a slot. TDM avoids collisions and the complexity of supporting acknowledgments and retransmissions. I-TDMA utilizes the TDM approach for scheduling access to the C channels. <p> I-TDMA is characterized by high delay under light traffic due to dependence of cycle length on the number of nodes. Under heavy traffic, it is stabler than I-SA and provides better performance. The theoretical bound for throughput has been shown to be 1 for a single-channel TDM system <ref> [81] </ref> (which is also the upper bound using any protocol). Similarly, the theoretical bound on throughput is C for a C-channel system. However, this was not achieved by I-TDMA. Head-of-line effects due to the single queue severely degraded the performance of I-TDMA [84].

We have investigated the first approach because it is simpler and tunable transmitters are less expensive than tunable receivers. The idea of pre-allocation was initially considered in <ref> [9, 82, 83] </ref>. The reservation approach has attracted a lot of research attention as presented in [6, 76]. Reservation protocols promise greater flexibility in the availability of data channels. However, some protocols proposed link the number of channels to the number of nodes in the system [8,12].

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2.5 (a) shows a system where each node has a single transmitter and a receiver. There are three possible configurations with this organization: tunable transmitter and fixed receiver, fixed transmitter and tunable receiver, and tunable transmitter/receiver. One particular configuration uses a tunable transmitter and one fixed receiver <ref> [84] </ref>. Each node listens to one channel referred to as its home channel. The home channel allocation to the nodes can be determined based on a uniform policy or based on traffic requirements. <p> This section briefly describes the research and the complete details may be found in <ref> [84, 87, 91-93] </ref>. The following assumptions have been made in protocol design: . The network architecture is based on the star topology with one tunable transmitter and one fixed receiver per node. Fig 3.1 shows the network architecture. 34 CHAPTER 3. ACCESS PROTOCOLS FOR WDM STAR NETWORKS . <p> A classic example of random access scheme is Slotted Aloha (SA). In SA, time is divided into equal length slots and a node can access the channel at the beginning of each slot. I-SA is a generalization of single-channel SA to the multi-channel WDM network. I-SA <ref> [84] </ref> allows a data packet to be transmitted on the destination`s home channel in the immediate slot following packet generation. Each node has a single queue of variable capacity to buffer packets generated when the transmitter is busy. <p> This tuning time can be overlapped with cycle synchronization time to reduce the impact of ff [91]. Semi-markov analytic and discrete-event simulation models to analyze the performance of I-TDMA have been presented in <ref> [84, 91] </ref>. I-TDMA is characterized by high delay under light traffic due to dependence of cycle length on the number of nodes. Under heavy traffic, it is stabler than I-SA and provides better performance. <p> Similarly, the theoretical bound on throughput is C for a C-channel system. However, this was not achieved by I-TDMA. Head-of-line effects due to the single queue severely degraded the performance of I-TDMA <ref> [84] </ref>. This motivated the development of an improved version of I-TDMA called I-TDMA*. I-TDMA* [92] is based on I-TDMA except that each node has C queues of variable capacity one per channel. New packets are buffered in the corresponding channel queue. <p> The above linear equations can be solved to yield the vector fP i g in terms of P s . P s in turn depends on fP i g as shown in <ref> [84] </ref>. The set of equations are solved iteratively to converge on P s and fP i g, 48 CHAPTER 3. ACCESS PROTOCOLS FOR WDM STAR NETWORKS which are then used to obtain the packet delay and the network throughput. <p> In I-SA, the load per channel decreases as C increases and fewer nodes share a channel thereby reducing collisions and increasing the network throughput. In I-TDMA* the performance is dominated by the cycle time which is proportional to M . However, the head-of-line effect that restricted I-TDMA <ref> [84] </ref> from taking advantage of increase in C is eliminated in I-TDMA*. The main drawback is the minimum average delay of M=2 slots which limits this protocol in terms of scalability. 65 CHAPTER 3.

It attains the maximum theoretical throughput (C) with C multi-access channels, is collision free and has low implementational complexity. Unlike I-SA and I-SA*, I-TDMA and I-TDMA* were seen to be insensitive to propagation 43 CHAPTER 3. <p> Acknowledgments are needed since collisions may occur on a channel. The source node transmits on other channels rather than wait for acknowledgment of the transmitted packets. As acknowledgments are received, other packets in the queue are transmitted. The receiver and transmitter behavior are described in <ref> [87] </ref>. In general, this is not a practical protocol for systems with large propagation delays. Alternative acknowledgment schemes have been examined in [93] that reduce but do not eliminate the performance degradation due to propagation delay. <p> A cycle is defined as the minimum time to allocate permission for all nodes to transmit on a channel. The minimum cycle length is M , the number of nodes. The node-to-channel allocation varies with transmitter switching latency, protocol processing latency, C and M <ref> [87] </ref>. The simplest allocation scheme is as follows: Node m i is initially allocated channel c 0 at time ((i + 1) mod M ). Subsequent channels are allocated one unit apart until all channels are allocated for this cycle. <p> EQEB is seen to be most sensitive to ff because of the double tuning time. It is possible to completely eliminate the impact of ff in I-TDMA* and B-TDMA if C (ff + 1) M as shown in <ref> [87] </ref> 4.3.2 Performance under Client/Server Model Fig. 4.4 compares the performance of the protocols under the client/server model for C = 16, M = 32, P = 16 and fi 2 f0:1; 0:5; 0:9g where fi represents the fraction of traffic directed towards the server. <p> In EQEB, increasing M increases the size of the distributed queue and hence access delay. I-SA* is scalable in the sense that performance can be maintained so long as the ratio of M=C is maintained, but only in the case of low propagation delay <ref> [87] </ref>. Increasing C reduces the traffic per channel and improves performance for all protocols 99 CHAPTER 4. STAR AND BUS TOPOLOGIES as seen from Figs. 4.2-4.3. However, when tuning latency is high, increasing the number of channels tends to offset the performance improvement due to more increased channel switching overhead. <p> However, when tuning latency is high, increasing the number of channels tends to offset the performance improvement due to more increased channel switching overhead. In I-TDMA* and B-TDMA, cycle length is determined by the relation between M , C and ff and allocation schemes vary accordingly <ref> [87] </ref>. Fairnet requires recomputation of transmission probabilities for all nodes with variations in C. Fault tolerance: The topological factors of fault tolerance have been studied earlier in Section 4.1. The media access aspects of fault tolerance are studied here. <p> Protocol Complexity: Protocol complexity is a critical feature in protocol design for high speed networks. In I-SA*, the transmitter and receiver require processing in each slot to keep track of unacknowledged packets which increases processing overhead per packet <ref> [87] </ref>. In I-TDMA*, nodes need not maintain acknowledgment information but the complexity of network synchronization to support time division multiplexing is a drawback. The bus based protocols require each node to sense carrier for protocol operation.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the theoretical bound on throughput is C for a C-channel system. However, this was not achieved by I-TDMA. Head-of-line effects due to the single queue severely degraded the performance of I-TDMA [84]. This motivated the development of an improved version of I-TDMA called I-TDMA*.

This is not an inherent assumption of the protocol and the model can be extended to include generalized transmitter buffer capacities as in <ref> [92] </ref>. 3.3.1 Semi-markov model for I-SA State Definitions: The receiver and transmitter at each node can change state during every slot. The receiver is passive in that it does not initiate activity. It is idle unless a packet is directed along its home channel. <p> This impact can be reduced by isolating the server home channel at system startup. I-SA* is significantly affected by the increased traffic on the server channel due to the increased collisions. Providing per channel queues eliminates head-of-line effects for packets destined for other channels <ref> [92] </ref>. In D-Net/C, EQEB and 95 CHAPTER 4.

Directory based schemes generate more node-to-node traffic and are characterized by many more cache control packets. The following sections describe the time multiplexed protocol I-TDMA <ref> [92] </ref> and the proposed hybrid protocol FatMAC. Each node requires a tunable transmitter and a fixed receiver subsystem. Each node receives traffic on a pre-determined channel. A source node tunes its transmitter to the home channel of the destination node and transmits according to the access protocol. <p> A 4 : A transmitter has a capacity to hold one packet when processing another packet. This is not an inherent assumption of the protocol and the model can be extended to include generalized transmitter buffer capacities as in <ref> [92] </ref>. A 5 : All memory block packets are of fixed length L times the length of a control packet. The performance of the protocol is modeled by studying the behavior of the transmitter which changes states most often.

Reference-contexts: Acknowledgments required in I-SA make the protocol potentially variable to propagation delay. The following paragraphs discuss two different acknowledgment schemes for I-SA. Extended Acknowledgments: A packet slot in I-SA is composed of two phases with this approach referred as ESS <ref> [93] </ref>: data transmission phase and acknowledgment subslots. The acknowledgment subslot includes destination node transmitter tuning time and propagation delay for the acknowledgment. Nodes do not transmit data packets in the acknowledgment subslot to avoid collisions. If M &gt; C, time multiplexing may be used to ensure collision-free acknowledgment transmission. <p> Piggybacking plays a significant role when traffic at each node is pre-sorted on transmission channel. The implementation details of the above two schemes and the performance analysis based on semi-markov and simulation models is presented in <ref> [93] </ref>. For a single channel network, the maximum utilization with SA for an infinite population system was analytically shown to be approximately 0.36 [81]. For a C channel system, theoretical throughput bound with I-SA is 0:36C. <p> As acknowledgments are received, other packets in the queue are transmitted. The receiver and transmitter behavior are described in [87]. In general, this is not a practical protocol for systems with large propagation delays. Alternative acknowledgment schemes have been examined in <ref> [93] </ref> that reduce but do not eliminate the performance degradation due to propagation delay. Packet collisions occur with I-SA* requiring packet retransmission which may result in unbounded delay and system instability. I-TDMA* avoids the complexity of acknowledgments by time multiplexing access to data channels.

Reference-contexts: Since data transmission starts every 2a + ff + 1 slots, there is an initial synchronization delay of (2a + ff + 1)=2 which may degrade performance when ff or a is significant. I-SA was first considered for a WDM-based optical backplane to support communication in a multiprocessor environment <ref> [94] </ref>. Propagation delay sensitivity was not initially a principal concern so acknowledgment was achieved by extending the slot to include the acknowledgment. However, in a local area environment, propagation delay is a significant concern. Also, the impact of the finite transmitter tuning time has to be considered.

Reference-contexts: Passive directional couplers transfer a fixed percentage of the power, while active couplers modify their reciprocity when transmitting. Regenerative node couplers remove most of the power off the bus and re-inject power by retransmitting the received signal resulting in an active optical network <ref> [100] </ref>. This approach has better fault tolerance since the network is revived despite single coupler failures. The number of amplifiers required and the placement of amplifiers on the bus have been considered in [2]. The star coupler is usually passive when no amplification is provided.

Reference-contexts: Other approaches have since been proposed for bus-based networks. A TDM-based protocol referred to as AMTRAC has been studied in [102]. Fairnet is based on per node transmission probabilities and has been studied for the multi-channel domain <ref> [103] </ref>. The distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) is being considered as a metropolitan area network standard (IEEE 802.6). A multi-channel extension of the DQDB protocol referred to Estimated Queue Extended Bus (EQEB) has been studied in [104]. In the following sections, we present the protocols used to evaluate the topologies. <p> A backlogged node transmits if the BUSY bit of a slot on the destination channel is not set simultaneously setting the BUSY bit. The values of p ic are determined from network traffic distribution and equity constraints <ref> [103] </ref>. B-TDMA: AMTRAC [102] is a protocol based on time multiplexed multi-channel access. Time is divided into equal slots of length where is the propagation delay between adjacent nodes. Each channel cycle is divided into 2M 2 slots allocating each node one slot per cycle. <p> Fairnet: Fig. 4.2 (b) shows the performance of Fairnet for M = 32, P 2 f1; 8; 16g and varying C. The transmission probabilities are based on equal average packet delay criterion as derived in <ref> [103] </ref>. For C = 1, P = 1 and M = 32, maximum system throughput is almost equal to 1. S max increases with C but does not approach C because of the increased switching overhead. The maximum throughput with 32 nodes and 32 channels is approximately 12. <p> The protocols themselves have been designed so that there is minimal processing overhead per packet except for carrier sensing and header processing. Fairnet may incur extra overhead if the nodes adaptively modify their transmission probabilities <ref> [103] </ref>. Case Study: Consider a network with 32 nodes and 16 channels. The star can easily support this system size without any amplification for a power margin of 40 dB, whereas both DUB and FUB require optical amplifiers.

Reference-contexts: The distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) is being considered as a metropolitan area network standard (IEEE 802.6). A multi-channel extension of the DQDB protocol referred to Estimated Queue Extended Bus (EQEB) has been studied in <ref> [104] </ref>. In the following sections, we present the protocols used to evaluate the topologies. All use receiver pre-allocation: each node receives traffic on exactly one channel, referred to as its home channel [105]. <p> DQDB, also based on the dual bus, has been proposed as the IEEE 802.6 media access standard for MANs. In this chapter, we consider a multi-channel extension of DQDB based on EQEB presented in <ref> [104] </ref>. DQDB is based on the QPSX protocol [106] and uses a pair of counters per node per bus to implement the distributed queue. EQEB eliminates the per node counter and uses a global counter maintained by the head nodes to implement the queuing. <p> EQEB eliminates the per node counter and uses a global counter maintained by the head nodes to implement the queuing. The node uses estimated delays before placing the request and data on the buses <ref> [104] </ref>. This chapter extends the single-buffer per node system proposed by EQEB and requires C queues per node. This eliminates some head-of-line effects and helps in partitioning data traffic as seen later. 4.2.3 Star Slotted Aloha provides access arbitration to each data channel with I-SA*. <p> This shows the limitation due to the increased switching overhead.

Reference-contexts: This is followed by transmission of a request packet to the target node. The requested block is transmitted by the target node. This might lead to contention problems at the network and the global memory module. An optically interconnected distributed shared memory system has been proposed and analyzed in <ref> [111] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Another possible extension to I-TDMA is to generalize the number of slots per frame where slots are allocated by a resource scheduler based on demand such as was proposed with universal time-slots <ref> [112] </ref>. This would avoid the static bandwidth allocation of I-TDMA, providing a more dynamic environment, but creates a connection-style environment where link setup needs to be negotiated. <p> As discussed earlier, another possible extension to I-TDMA is to generalize the number of slots per frame where slots are allocated by a resource scheduler based on demand such as was proposed with universal time-slots <ref> [112] </ref>. FatMAC: Fig. 5.5 (b) shows the extension of single-level FatMAC to a multi-level system. A cluster is defined as a set of nodes and channels operating at one level of the hierarchy. For example, consider a 2-level 4 fi 4 system. <p> I-TDMA/S may be most advantageous under low values of fl. The maximum throughput will be higher than both I-TDMA/L and FatMAC. The downside will be the longer delays suffered by memory block packets due to segmentation. Its possible to implement an approach such as the universal time-slot <ref> [112] </ref> where a node is given a number of slots per frame depending on need, but this would require a signaling manager. The long delays due to segmenting the packet into L units may be avoided by increasing the slot size to an intermediate value L=x.

Reference-contexts: FatMAC combines reservation access and pre-allocated receivers. The satellite access protocol studied in <ref> [113] </ref> used a time multiplexed reservation cycle followed by a data cycle, overlapping the long satellite propagation delays through interleaving reservation and data cycles. FatMAC generalizes this two-phase approach to a multi-channel environment. Typical WDM based reservation access protocols allocate one of the channels as a dedicated control channel. <p> This protocol was modified to include a fixed-frame structure and has been studied in [125, 126]. The frame consists of a reservation subframe and a data subframe each consisting of more than one slot. Contention based priority oriented demand assignment (CPODA) <ref> [113] </ref> uses SA for the reservation subframe of each data frame. Each fixed size frame consists of a centralized assignment subframe, a distributed assignment subframe and control subframe. Stability and fairness mechanisms have been added to the protocol.

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 5. PROTOCOLS FOR DSM ARCHITECTURE Transmission in satellite frames is usually organized in frames. A frame consists of a fixed number of packet slots and each frame has enough slots so that the frame length exceeds the round trip propagation delay <ref> [122] </ref>. When a source is able to successfully transmit in a slot, it automatically reserves access on corresponding slots in the next frame. A node may transmit and end-of-transmission in its last packet allowing other nodes to contend for the slot in the next frame.

Reference-contexts: A node may transmit and end-of-transmission in its last packet allowing other nodes to contend for the slot in the next frame. A variation of this scheme is to allow each source own a data slot within the frame <ref> [123] </ref>. When a source is not using its slot, other nodes can capture it by contention. The owner node can reclaim a captured slot by sending a packet in its allocated slot. This approach is stable and provides fair allocation.

Reference-contexts: This protocol has been modified to include a separate narrowband reservation subchannel using SA in [130]. Two distributed reservation control protocols are studied in the paper for transmission of fixed length datagram packets. A combination of contention and reservation based transmission is studied in <ref> [131] </ref>. Each frame is divided into reserved slots followed by Aloha slots. Each slot consists of a set of reservation minislots and one data subslot. A node places a reservation on the reservation minislot in contention mode. It also attempts transmission in the Aloha slots.

Reference-contexts: A node places a reservation on the reservation minislot in contention mode. It also attempts transmission in the Aloha slots. If this is successful, the reservation is ignored. A modification of this protocol consists of Aloha slots followed by reserved slots protocol is studied in <ref> [132] </ref>. The protocol is studied for traffic composed of short and long messages. A short message is sent in an Aloha slot as are reservations for long messages. This model corresponds to the SA based protocol proposed in the next section. The main difference is the fixed frame structure of [132]. <p> <ref> [132] </ref>. The protocol is studied for traffic composed of short and long messages.

The main difference is the fixed frame structure of [132]. The satellite internetworking environment described in [133] combines TDM-based and SA-based access. The network is based on a satellite switch that has on-board processing to connect uplinks and downlinks. Each uplink frame consists of different types of slots: request, interactive data slots, and reserved slots for data services.

Reference-contexts: PROTOCOLS FOR DSM ARCHITECTURE The advantage of the dynamically varying control length approach is that it allows the system to be switched between Slotted Aloha and TDM on the control cycle. Such an approach has been studied for a non reservation protocol in <ref> [134] </ref>. The clock node switches over to TDM mode on the control cycle if the collision probabilities exceed a threshold. A similar threshold may be used to switch to SA mode if the traffic is very light and collision probability drops below a certain level.

Reference-contexts: The above discussion shows the severity of bit synchronization overhead on the performance of the protocol. The short control packets force very fast clock acquisition times. Fast clock recovery circuits have been discussed in [135-137]. The approach proposed in <ref> [137] </ref> achieve clock recovery on the first data transition. A maximum of 100 bits may be transmitted before clock synchronization occurs at speeds of up to 650 Mbps. I-TDMA/L I-TDMA can be implemented so that the slot size equals the memory block size. Let I-TDMA/L denote this protocol.

Reference-contexts: This is a serious concern for systems with large propagation delays. Distributed clock: A distributed clock mechanism will be used in this approach to achieve network slot synchronization. This scheme is similar to the one proposed in <ref> [138] </ref>. The first node to join the system is designated as the clock node which transmits a clock packet at the start of each cycle. The clock packet contains the propagation delay of the clock node to the partitioner, the current time (to nanosecond accuracy).
