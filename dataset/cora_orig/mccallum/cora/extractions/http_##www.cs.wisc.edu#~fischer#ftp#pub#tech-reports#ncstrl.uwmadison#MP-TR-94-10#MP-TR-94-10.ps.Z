Abstract: Two medical applications of linear programming are described in this paper. Specifically, linear-programming-based machine learning techniques are used to increase the accuracy and objectivity of breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The first application to breast cancer diagnosis utilizes characteristics of individual cells, obtained from a minimally invasive fine needle aspirate, to discriminate benign from malignant breast lumps. This allows an accurate diagnosis without the need for a surgical biopsy. The diagnostic system in current operation at University of Wisconsin Hospitals was trained on samples from 569 patients and has had 100% chronological correctness in diagnosing 131 subsequent patients. The second application, recently put into clinical practice, is a method that constructs a surface that predicts when breast cancer is likely to recur in patients that have had their cancers excised. This gives the physician and the patient better information with which to plan treatment, and may eliminate the need for a prognostic surgical procedure. The novel feature of the predictive approach is the ability to handle cases for which cancer has not recurred (censored data) as well as cases for which cancer has recurred at a specific time. The prognostic system has an expected error of 13.9 to 18.3 months, which is better than prognosis correctness by other available techniques. Despite a great deal of public awareness and scientific research, breast cancer continues to be the most common cancer and the second largest cause of cancer deaths among women [19]. Approximately 12% of U.S. women will be diagnosed with breast cancer [21], and 3.5% will die of it [23]. The annual mortality rate of approximately 28 deaths per 100,000 women has remained nearly constant over the past 20 years [20]. A breast cancer victim's chances for long-term survival are improved by early detection of the disease, and early detection is in turn enhanced by an accurate diagnosis. The choice of appropriate treatments immediately following surgery is largely influenced by prognosis, that is, the expected long-term behavior of the disease. We will describe two significant applications of linear programming in the field of breast cancer research, one in diagnosis and one in prognosis. Both applications, currently in clinical practice, depend on the analysis of cellular images, accomplished with a computer program called

Reference-contexts: One of these, termed implicit RSA (IRSA), builds on the data preprocessing used by Ravdin and colleagues <ref> [6, 27, 28] </ref>. Time is added as an input feature, and given values along the range of follow-up times in the study. Each case thus produces a number of new training examples which are identical except for the time feature.

Reference-contexts: There are three available methods for diagnosing breast cancer: mammography, FNA with visual interpretation, and surgical biopsy. The reported sensitivity (i.e., ability to correctly diagnose cancer when the disease is present) of mammography varies from 68% to 79% <ref> [7] </ref>, of FNA with visual interpretation from 65% to 98% [8], and of surgical biopsy close to 100%. Therefore, mammography lacks sensitivity, FNA sensitivity varies widely, and surgical biopsy, although accurate, is invasive, time consuming, and costly.

Reference-contexts: Using this model, we now predict a time of recurrence for patients who have been diagnosed with a malignant tumor, to aid the choice of treatment. Further, Xcyt provides estimates of the patient's probability of disease-free survival in the form of a Kaplan-Meier curve <ref> [11] </ref> (Figure 4). The disease-free-survival curve for the individual patient is based on those training cases that had a similar predicted time of recurrence as determined by the RSA (4).

Reference-contexts: In this manner, we can use the tuning set to select the complexity of the model without paying the penalty of losing some of the training set. 5 Computational Results for the Prognostic System The RSA procedure was tested with leave-one-out testing <ref> [12] </ref> to evaluate its accuracy in predicting future outcomes. The leave-one-out method is a special case of cross-validation in which the predictive model is built using all but one of the examples and tested on the left-out case; this is repeated using each example, in turn, as the test case.

Reference-contexts: While a patient can be classified as a 'recur' if the disease is observed at some subsequent time to tumor excision, a patient for whom cancer has not recurred and may never recur, has an unknown or censored <ref> [13] </ref> time to recur (TTR). For the latter patients, all that is known is the disease-free survival (DFS) time of their last checkup.

Reference-contexts: Underestimated recurrent points are not considered to be as serious of an error as overestimated ones. To reflect this, the v term in the objective is weighed by an appropriately small positive parameter ffi, forcing underestimated recurrent points closer to the surface. Based on a perturbation theorem <ref> [16] </ref>, for a sufficiently small positive ffi, that is 0 &lt; ffi ffi for some ffi, the objective minimizes the weighted term conditionally, i.e., of those possible variable values which minimize the first two terms of the objective, those values which minimize the third term are chosen.

Reference-contexts: The goal of the diagnostic aspect of our research is to develop a relatively objective system that diagnoses FNAs with an accuracy that approaches the best achieved visually. In contrast to previous work <ref> [17, 33] </ref> where cytological features were subjectively evaluated by the attending physician, the diagnostic system in current use at University of Wisconsin Hospitals uses the Xcyt system described above to generate a 30-dimensional feature vector for each patient.

Reference-contexts: Both applications, currently in clinical practice, depend on the analysis of cellular images, accomplished with a computer program called 1 Xcyt, written by one of the authors [31], that we describe in Section 1. The first application to breast cancer diagnosis has been described earlier <ref> [17, 18, 32, 34, 35] </ref> and is outlined in Section 2. The details of the diagnosis process in a clinical setting are described in Section 3.
