Reference-contexts: We call this model the adversarial path-packing model. A more general model was suggested in [BKR + 96], and was fully developed in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, in which the rate of the adversary is specified by a pair (w; r), where w is a natural number, and 0 &lt; r &lt; 1. <p> The requirement of the adversary is the following: of the packets that the adversary injects in any interval of w steps at most brwc can have paths that contain any one edge. We will refer to this model as the adversarial packet routing model. In <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref> a universally stable queueing policy is defined as a queueing policy that is stable against any adversary of rate less than 1, on every network. <p> A universally stable graph is defined as a graph G, such that every queueing policy is stable against every adversary of rate less than 1 on G. Borodin et al. [BKR + 96] showed that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are universally stable in the adversarial packet routing model. In <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref> the unidirectional ring is shown to be universally stable in the same model. Furthermore, Andrews et al., prove that in this model the queueing policies Furthest-To-Go (FTG), Longest-In-System (LIS) and Shortest-In-System (SIS) are universally stable. <p> The NTG queueing policy gives precedence to the packet whose distance to its destination is minimal. They prove that these protocols can be unstable on commonly used networks, including arrays and hypercubes. 1.3 Our results The model presented in <ref> [BKR + 96, AAF + 96] </ref> is directed to the study of packet routing networks, where customers require unit service times. In this thesis we define a broader class of adversaries that models general queueing networks. This model was first suggested in [BKR + 96]. <p> The adversary determines only the initial configuration of the system. Depending on the size of the network the injection rate can become arbitrarily small. The instability example answers negatively an open question raised in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>: is there some rate for which any queuing policy is universally stable? The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 2 we present a short review of some relevant results in queueing theory. <p> Thus, a set of S sessions in the leaky-bucket model corresponds to an adversary of rate less than one in the adversarial model defined in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, or in our model. Any stability result in the latter models implies an analogous result in the former model. However, the class of adversaries described by the Cruz model is significantly weaker than the one defined in [AAF + 96], or in our model. <p> rate less than one in the adversarial model defined in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, or in our model. Any stability result in the latter models implies an analogous result in the former model. However, the class of adversaries described by the Cruz model is significantly weaker than the one defined in [AAF + 96], or in our model. The Cruz model requires that once some session is set up, it remains permanently active, and it always injects packets at the same rate. The model in [AAF + 96] allows the adversary to halt and resume the operation of some session, or to <p> class of adversaries described by the Cruz model is significantly weaker than the one defined in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, or in our model. The Cruz model requires that once some session is set up, it remains permanently active, and it always injects packets at the same rate. The model in [AAF + 96] allows the adversary to halt and resume the operation of some session, or to introduce a new session. The rate of some session may vary over time. This broader model is necessary, when modeling connections of limited duration. <p> Following the definition of Andrews et al. <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, a system is defined as a triplet (G; A; Q), where G is the underlying graph of the network, A is the adversary, and Q is the queueing policy. <p> We give the following definition of stability: Definition 3.2 A system (G; A; Q) is stable if for every initial configuration, there exists some constant C, such that the total workload in the system at all times is bounded by C. Following the definitions in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref> we give the following definitions: Definition 3.3 We say that a graph G is universally stable, if for every " &gt; 0 and w 1 every work-conserving queueing policy is stable against every adversary of rate (w; 1 ") on G, for any initial configuration. <p> THE NEW ADVERSARIAL MODEL configuration, then there exists a system (G 0 ; A 0 ; Q) that is unstable starting from an empty configuration, where A 0 has the same rate as A. 3.2 Universal stability of queueing policies Andrews et al. <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, showed that the queueing policies Furthest-To-Go (FTG), Longest-In-System (LIS) and Shortest-In-System (SIS) are universally stable in the adversarial packet routing model. <p> We will prove that these queueing policies remain universally stable in the new model. For the following proofs we will assume that the length of the longest path of any customer injected by the adversary is bounded. The proofs of stability follow closely the proofs presented in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>. The assumption of bounded path lengths is also stated in [AAF + 96]. <p> For the following proofs we will assume that the length of the longest path of any customer injected by the adversary is bounded. The proofs of stability follow closely the proofs presented in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>. The assumption of bounded path lengths is also stated in [AAF + 96]. However, in the adversarial packet routing model the bound on the length of any path is directly implied by the fact that all packets require unit service times at all servers, and no packet can cross an edge more than (1 ")w times. <p> Therefore under FTG the total workload in the system is bounded by P j1 W j , and the maximum amount of time that any customer spends in the system is bounded by W 1 " . 3.3 Instability of the ring Andrews et al. <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, proved that the ring is universally stable in the adversarial packet routing model. Any packet routing network can be easily turned into a queueing network, simply by replacing the edges with servers. <p> The result in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref> implies that if the service times required by the customers are the same at any server of the network, then the ring of servers is universally stable. <p> That is, there exists some ffi &gt; 0, such that for any customer c, the service time required by c at any server in its path is at least ffi. The proof follows closely the proof of stability of FTG presented in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref> and the one presented in section 3.2.3. If we allow the adversary to inject customers that require arbitrarily small service time at some servers, then we will show that there exists 3.4. <p> Chapter 5 Conclusions In this work we extended the adversarial model described in [BKR + 96] and <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref> to include general queueing networks. In the new adversarial model we considered four new queueing policies: Most-Time-To-Go (MTTG), Least-Time-To-Go (LTTG), Most-Service-Demand (MSD), and Least-Service-Demand (LSD). <p> The above models are not trivial generalizations of the adversarial model defined in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>. For example, breaking packets of large size into many packets of unit size, or replacing edges of large service rate with many edges of unit service rate, does not necessarily yield equivalent systems. <p> in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>. For example, breaking packets of large size into many packets of unit size, or replacing edges of large service rate with many edges of unit service rate, does not necessarily yield equivalent systems. However, it seems probable that the universal stability of the ring presented in [AAF + 96] can be extended to these models. A strong indication in this direction is the proof of stability of the ring under the Cruz model, presented in [TG96], where packets of different sizes are considered. <p> The question was first posed by Andrews et al., for the adversarial model defined in <ref> [AAF + 96] </ref>, where all packets have unit service requirements at each server. In the new model, it would be interesting to examine if the example presented in [Bra94b] can be translated into the adversarial context.

Reference-contexts: This model allows for more general routing schemes. Multiclass networks can also be called customer-centered networks since the routing variables and the service times are associated with the individual customers [BF94]. The multiclass model was introduced independently by Kelly [Kel75] and Basket et al. <ref> [BCMP75] </ref>. We first present the model described in [Kel75]. A Kelly network consists of J servers and I different types of customers. <p> Under the rate condition, this class of networks is stable, under LIFO and PS queueing policies, and has a product form solution. A related model was introduced independently by Basket et al <ref> [BCMP75] </ref>. There are J servers and I classes of customers. Customers are injected by a Poisson process with arrival rate dependent on the state of the system. An arriving customer enters at server i in class r with a fixed probability q ir .

Reference-contexts: All customers receive the same service and follow the same routing scheme. Single-class networks can also be called station-centered networks, since the service times and the routing variables are associated with the servers, and they are handed out to customers as they are picked for service <ref> [BF94] </ref>. The model of single-class networks was first introduced by Jackson [Jac63]. A Jackson network consists of J interconnected servers. The outside world is conventionally indexed as server 0. The arrivals of customers from the external world to a server are all generated by an independent Poisson process. <p> The problem of determining the stability of generalized Jackson networks turned out to be more difficult to resolve.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis we work within a model proposed by Borodin et al. <ref> [BKR + 96] </ref>, in which probabilistic assumptions are replaced by worst-case inputs. <p> For systems that are not stable, we seek to establish instability within the weakest possible adversarial model. 1.2 Adversarial Queueing Theory Adversarial Queueing Theory was introduced by Borodin et al. <ref> [BKR + 96] </ref>, for the study of packet routing networks. A packet routing network is a special case of a queueing network where packets (i.e. customers) move on the edges (i.e. servers) of a directed graph. All packets take unit time to cross any edge in the network. <p> A queueing policy is said to be stable against an adversary if the total number of packets in the system is bounded over time. A crucial parameter of the adversary is the rate. In <ref> [BKR + 96] </ref> a request by the adversary is defined to be a set of packets requesting edge-disjoint paths; in their terminology an adversary injects at rate r, if for all t, no more than drte requests are made in any interval of t steps. <p> We call this model the adversarial path-packing model. A more general model was suggested in <ref> [BKR + 96] </ref>, and was fully developed in [AAF + 96], in which the rate of the adversary is specified by a pair (w; r), where w is a natural number, and 0 &lt; r &lt; 1. <p> A universally stable graph is defined as a graph G, such that every queueing policy is stable against every adversary of rate less than 1 on G. Borodin et al. <ref> [BKR + 96] </ref> showed that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are universally stable in the adversarial packet routing model. In [AAF + 96] the unidirectional ring is shown to be universally stable in the same model. <p> The NTG queueing policy gives precedence to the packet whose distance to its destination is minimal. They prove that these protocols can be unstable on commonly used networks, including arrays and hypercubes. 1.3 Our results The model presented in <ref> [BKR + 96, AAF + 96] </ref> is directed to the study of packet routing networks, where customers require unit service times.

The rate of an adversary in our work will be specified by a pair (w; ), where w is any number and 0 &lt; &lt; 1. <p> Chapter 5 Conclusions In this work we extended the adversarial model described in <ref> [BKR + 96] </ref> and [AAF + 96] to include general queueing networks.

Reference-contexts: So far our focus has been on adversaries that inject customers at some rate less than 1. It is interesting to study the behavior of queueing policies against adversaries with arbitrarily small injection rate. A recent result of Borodin, Kleinberg, Sudan and Williamson <ref> [BKSW96] </ref> indicates that NTG can be unstable against adversaries of arbitrary small positive rates. We present a detailed proof of the instability of NTG on a packet routing network, when packets are injected at constant rate. The adversary determines only the initial configuration of the system. <p> In contrast to the examples described in [Bra94a, Bra94b] for FIFO queueing policy, the customers visit each server at most once, and require unit service times at each server. The instability example was first described, and informally proven in <ref> [BKSW96] </ref>, and it was motivated from the study of packet routing networks. We give a formal proof in this chapter. We also show that the network of servers N can be transformed into a packet routing network that is also unstable for the same rate. <p> We showed that the universal stability of FTG, LIS, and SIS queueing policies goes through in the new adversarial model, while MTTG is universally stable against a class of restricted adversaries. Furthermore, following the outline in <ref> [BKSW96] </ref> we provided a complete proof that the NTG queueing policy can be made unstable against an "adversary" that injects arbitrarily small workload at constant rate. This work leaves open several interesting questions. One is to determine the stability of the LSD queueing policy.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, it seems that the rate condition should be sufficient for stability of any queueing network. This is true for many systems [Kle75, Kel79], but it is not true in all cases <ref> [LK91, RS92, DW96, Bra94a, Bra94b, Sei94] </ref>. The question of necessary and sufficient conditions for stability is one of the most interesting questions in the area of queueing networks. Queueing networks are the object of study of queueing theory. <p> The same result was proven in [DW96] for the corresponding fluid network, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. Both examples above are based on priority rules for the servers. Bramson <ref> [Bra94a] </ref> extended the phenomenon underlying these examples to the case of FIFO queueing policy. <p> It is demonstrated in <ref> [Bra94a] </ref> that for c sufficiently close to 1, if the number of visits to server S 2 is sufficiently large and ffi is sufficiently small, then the system is unstable under the rate condition. <p> Instability of FIFO queueing policy on multiclass networks was also shown by Seidman in [Sei94] for a different model, where arrivals and service times are deterministic. The results of Bramson <ref> [Bra94a, Bra94b] </ref> and Seidman [Sei94] are some of the most surprising developments in the area of queueing networks. 2.2 Applications to packet routing A packet routing network is a special case of a queueing system. In packet routing networks the customers are packets that move on a directed graph. <p> Bramson considers networks where the service time of a customer at a server depends on the server and not on the class of the customer that is being serviced (this condition excludes the unstable network described in <ref> [Bra94a] </ref>). He proves that any queueing network is stable under the FIFO queueing policy, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times 1 . This class of networks includes packet routing networks with constant service times and Poisson arrivals. <p> We will prove that for any " &gt; 0, there exists a network N such that NTG is unstable for injection rate less than ", in a model significantly weaker than the one described in chapter 3. In contrast to the examples described in <ref> [Bra94a, Bra94b] </ref> for FIFO queueing policy, the customers visit each server at most once, and require unit service times at each server. The instability example was first described, and informally proven in [BKSW96], and it was motivated from the study of packet routing networks.

An interesting corollary derived in [Bra94b] is that decreasing the mean service times within the network may have the effect of making it unstable.

Reference-contexts: It remains a major open question if the converse also holds. Using fluid models Dai and Weiss [DW96] prove that FBFS and LBFS are stable for any re-entrant line. Furthermore, the unidirectional ring of servers is stable under any work-conserving queueing policy. Recent results by Bramson <ref> [Bra96] </ref> use the fluid model defined by Dai to prove the stability of multiclass networks under general distributions on the inter-arrival and service times. <p> Bramson considers networks where the service time of a customer at a server depends on the server and not on the class of the customer that is being serviced. These networks are termed in <ref> [Bra96] </ref> as generalized Kelly networks. <p> However, the counter-example of Harchol-Balter and Wolfe indicates that it is not possible to obtain bounds for general networks by applying the approach in [ST91]. The question of stability of FIFO queueing policy on packet routing networks was resolved only recently by Bramson <ref> [Bra96] </ref>, using limiting fluid models. Bramson considers networks where the service time of a customer at a server depends on the server and not on the class of the customer that is being serviced (this condition excludes the unstable network described in [Bra94a]). <p> It would be interesting to consider the same question when we do not allow immediate feedback. It remains an interesting open question to determine a set of general conditions that are sufficient to guarantee the stability of general multiclass networks. Recent results by Bramson <ref> [Bra96] </ref> show that the FIFO and PS queueing policies are stable under generalized assumptions on the arrival process and the service times, when the service times are class independent.

Reference-contexts: The distinctive feature is that customers may revisit the same server more than once with different service requirements at each visit. The arrival process follows the leaky-bucket model introduced by Cruz <ref> [Cru91a, Cru91b] </ref>. The arrivals of customers are deterministic: during any interval of time [s; t] the number of customers that arrive in the system is (t s) + fl; where is the arrival rate, and fl is a constant that allows for some burstiness in the arrivals. <p> This class of networks includes packet routing networks with constant service times and Poisson arrivals. A different model was proposed by Cruz <ref> [Cru91a, Cru91b] </ref> that models the so-called "leaky-bucket" method of flow control proposed for high speed networks. In this model the packets are injected in S sessions; at each session packets that follow a fixed path are injected at a fixed rate (with some burstiness allowed). <p> A similar result was proven in [DW96], using limiting fluid models, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. Stability of the ring under any queueing policy was also proven in [TG96] for the "leaky bucket" model defined by Cruz in <ref> [Cru91a, Cru91b] </ref>. We show that this does not hold if the customers can require different service times at different servers.

A different model was proposed by Cruz <ref> [Cru91a, Cru91b] </ref> that models the so-called "leaky-bucket" method of flow control proposed for high speed networks. In this model the packets are injected in S sessions; at each session packets that follow a fixed path are injected at a fixed rate (with some burstiness allowed). <p> PREVIOUS WORK edge of the network at any interval of time (s; t) is at most ae (t s) + oe; (2.1) where ae &lt; 1, and oe is a constant that allows for some burstiness. Cruz <ref> [Cru91b] </ref> proves the stability of every work-conserving queueing policy on every layered DAG. Tassiulas and Georgiades [TG96] work within this model and prove that every work-conserving queueing policy is stable on the ring. <p> A similar result was proven in [DW96], using limiting fluid models, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. Stability of the ring under any queueing policy was also proven in [TG96] for the "leaky bucket" model defined by Cruz in <ref> [Cru91a, Cru91b] </ref>. We show that this does not hold if the customers can require different service times at different servers.

Dai and Weiss <ref> [DW96] </ref> proved that the corresponding fluid network is unstable, if and only if m 2 + m 4 1, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. This is a strong indication that the queueing network is unstable under the same conditions. <p> They proved that if m 12 = m 21 &gt; 1 2 , the system is unstable. The same result was proven in <ref> [DW96] </ref> for the corresponding fluid network, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. Both examples above are based on priority rules for the servers. Bramson [Bra94a] extended the phenomenon underlying these examples to the case of FIFO queueing policy. <p> The result in [AAF + 96] implies that if the service times required by the customers are the same at any server of the network, then the ring of servers is universally stable. A similar result was proven in <ref> [DW96] </ref>, using limiting fluid models, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. Stability of the ring under any queueing policy was also proven in [TG96] for the "leaky bucket" model defined by Cruz in [Cru91a, Cru91b].

Reference-contexts: Single-class networks can also be called station-centered networks, since the service times and the routing variables are associated with the servers, and they are handed out to customers as they are picked for service [BF94]. The model of single-class networks was first introduced by Jackson <ref> [Jac63] </ref>. A Jackson network consists of J interconnected servers. The outside world is conventionally indexed as server 0. The arrivals of customers from the external world to a server are all generated by an independent Poisson process.

Reference-contexts: This model allows for more general routing schemes. Multiclass networks can also be called customer-centered networks since the routing variables and the service times are associated with the individual customers [BF94].

Reference-contexts: There is a single type of customers in the system that follows the sequence B 1 ; B 2 ; B 3 ; B 4 . Customers arrive at constant rate; one customer arrives at each time step.

The question of necessary and sufficient conditions for stability is one of the most interesting questions in the area of queueing networks. Queueing networks are the object of study of queueing theory. <p> BCMP and Kelly networks assume Poisson arrivals and impose restrictions on the service times and the queueing policy. The question of stability of multiclass networks for general queueing policies, under generalized distributional assumptions on the arrivals and the service times has only been considered recently.

In this model all customers are of the same type; they enter the system at the same server and follow the same route. <p> If at that time the other buffer is not empty, the server switches to that buffer. They proved that in this model the above network can become unstable if m 1 + m 4 &gt; 1. Building on this example, Lu and Kumar <ref> [LK91] </ref> considered a queueing policy that imposes the following priority rules for which buffer the server will serve: buffer B 4 has priority over buffer B 1 at server S 1 , and buffer B 2 has priority over buffer B 3 at server S 2 . <p> The input stream of customers of both types is a Poisson process of rate 1. The service time of a customer of type i at server S j follows some distribution with mean m ij . The queueing discipline imposes the same priority rules as in <ref> [LK91] </ref>, i.e., customers of type 1 have priority at server S 2 , and customers of type 2 have priority at server S 1 .

Reference-contexts: However, recent advances in the area of generalized Jackson and Kelly networks make it possible to argue directly about stability in packet routing networks, using results in queueing theory. The problem of packet routing was first considered outside the context of queueing theory ([Lei90],[KL95]). Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis <ref> [ST91] </ref> were the first to apply results of queueing theory to the special case of layered Markovian networks. In Markovian networks the next edge to be traversed by a packet is a random function of the edge just traversed, and it is independent of the identity of the packet. <p> Since the latter has a product form solution, queueing theory can yield bounds on the expected queue sizes. They apply this result on layered networks such as the butterfly and the hypercube. Harchol-Balter and Wolfe [HBW95] generalize the result in <ref> [ST91] </ref> for any Markovian network, showing that the "layered" assumption is not necessary. But they also show that when removing the Markovian assumption there is an example where the delays for FIFO with constant service times are no longer statistically dominated by the delays for processor sharing servers. <p> Mitzenmacher [Mit94] proves this conjecture for one bend routing on arrays using the result of Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis. However, the counter-example of Harchol-Balter and Wolfe indicates that it is not possible to obtain bounds for general networks by applying the approach in <ref> [ST91] </ref>. The question of stability of FIFO queueing policy on packet routing networks was resolved only recently by Bramson [Bra96], using limiting fluid models.

Reference-contexts: Cruz [Cru91b] proves the stability of every work-conserving queueing policy on every layered DAG. Tassiulas and Georgiades <ref> [TG96] </ref> work within this model and prove that every work-conserving queueing policy is stable on the ring. The Cruz model tries to capture worst case settings and it is in fact a weaker adversarial model. At each one of the S sessions a different type of packets is injected. <p> A similar result was proven in [DW96], using limiting fluid models, under the assumptions of the fluid model for the inter-arrival and service times. Stability of the ring under any queueing policy was also proven in <ref> [TG96] </ref> for the "leaky bucket" model defined by Cruz in [Cru91a, Cru91b]. We show that this does not hold if the customers can require different service times at different servers. <p> However, it seems probable that the universal stability of the ring presented in [AAF + 96] can be extended to these models. A strong indication in this direction is the proof of stability of the ring under the Cruz model, presented in <ref> [TG96] </ref>, where packets of different sizes are considered. The proof of instability of NTG against an adversary of arbitrarily small rate assumes a symmetric structure of the initial configuration.
