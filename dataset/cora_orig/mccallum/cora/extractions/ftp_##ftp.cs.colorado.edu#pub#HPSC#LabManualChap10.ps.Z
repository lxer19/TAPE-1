Title: Lab 10 Molecular Dynamics on the Cray Y-MP 10.1 Introduction  
Note: 261  
Abstract: In this chapter we use Verlet's algorithm on the Cray Y-MP to solve the molecular dynamics problem for the HL model and the LJ model. We use only the vector arithmetic feature of the Cray Y-MP, not its multiprocessing capability. You should be familiar with the material in the book chapter on molecular dynamics (also available as [Fosdick 95]) and the one on submitting jobs to the Cray Y-MP (also available as [Schauble 95]). We begin with the HL model and look at the vectorization of the code for a one-dimensional problem. Then we measure the performance of the program on the Cray Y-MP for different-sized problems. This work is repeated for the LJ model. Finally, you are invited to explore some three-dimensional problems in the LJ model with small and large systems. In doing the work in this chapter, remember that type REAL in Cray Fortran is approximately equivalent to type DOUBLE PRECISION in Fortran on the DECstation. Do not use DOUBLE PRECISION on the Cray because Cray double-precision arithmetic is implemented in software and takes much longer to execute than real arithmetic.
