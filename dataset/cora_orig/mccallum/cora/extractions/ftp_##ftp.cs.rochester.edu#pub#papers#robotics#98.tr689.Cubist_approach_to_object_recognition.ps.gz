Title: A Cubist approach to Object Recognition

Abstract: We describe an appearance-based object recognition system using a keyed, multi-level context representation reminiscent of certain aspects of cubist art. Specifically, we utilize distinctive intermediate-level features in this case automatically extracted 2-D boundary fragments, as keys, which are then verified within a local context, and assembled within a loose global context to evoke an overall percept. This system demonstrates extraordinarly good recognition of a variety of 3-D shapes, ranging from sports cars and fighter planes to snakes and lizards with full orthographic invariance. We report the results of large-scale tests, involving over 2000 separate test images, that evaluate performance with increasing number of items in the database, in the presence of clutter, background change, and occlusion, and also the results of some generic classification experiments where the system is tested on objects never previously seen or modelled. To our knowledge, the results we report are the best in the literature for full-sphere tests of general shapes with occlusion and clutter resistance. Key Words: Object recognition, Appearance-based representations, Visual learning. fl Support for this work was provided by ONR grant N00014-93-I-0221, and NSF IIP Grant CDA-94-01142

Reference-contexts: There has been a fair amount of work on automatic acquisition of geometric models, mostly with range sensors, e.g., [17; 19; 2] but also visually, for various representations <ref> [20; 3; 1; 5] </ref>. However, these techniques are limited to a particular geometric schema, and even within their domain, especially with visual techniques, their performance is often unsatisfactory. Appearance-based object recognition methods have been proposed in order to make recognition systems more general, and more easily trainable from visual data.

Reference-contexts: Most of them essentially operate by comparing an image-like representation of object appearance against many prototype representations stored in a memory, and finding the closest match. They have the advantage of being fairly general, and often easily trainable. In recent work, Poggio has recognized wire objects and faces <ref> [15; 4] </ref>. Rao and Ballard [16] describe an approach based on the memorization of the responses of a set of steerable filters. Mel [12] takes a somewhat similar approach using a database of stored feature vectors representing multiple low-level cues.

Reference-contexts: The system needs a characteristic shape or pattern to index on, and does not work well for objects whose character is statistical, such as generic trees or pine cones. Component boundaries were extracted by modifying a stick-growing method for finding segments developed recently at Rochester <ref> [14] </ref> so that it could follow curved boundaries. of the objects we later use for testing. Training images generally produce contours of about this quality. Images the system is applied to do not need to be nearly so clean.
