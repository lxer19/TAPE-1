Abstract: We give a lower bound of (f bd=2c ) for the number of vertices of a d-dimensional polytope with f facets which can appear on the outer boundary of a projection to any dimension 2 k &lt; d. By duality, this implies a lower bound of (n bd=2c ) for the number of facets in a k-dimensional slice of a d-dimensional polytope with n vertices. At the same time, the Upper Bound Theorem provides an O(n bd=2c ) upper bound for this quantity. For cyclic polytopes, however, we show an upper bound of O(n) on this quantity in dimension four. We give a new algorithm for the construction of the boundary of the projection.

Reference-contexts: One optimization problem is the maximization of a convex function in k variables x 1 ; : : : ; x k over a polytope P . The maximum is achieved at some vertex of the k-shadow. In <ref> [AAAS] </ref> this maximization is applied to finding the largest similar copy of one convex polygon contained in another, a problem with applications in vision and robotics. The computation of shadows was studied in [PoFa] and [PSSBM].

Reference-contexts: Shadows are natural objects in combinatorial geometry, and they have a number of algorithmic applications. Perhaps most importantly, the shadow vertex algorithm for linear programming chooses a simplex path by following a two-dimensional shadow <ref> [GS, Borg] </ref>. Lower bounds on the size of the two-dimensional shadow provide lower bounds for this algorithm. <p> Exponential lower bounds in the special case f = 2d were given by Murty [Mu] and Goldfarb [Gol1, Gol2]; our example handles the case where d is fixed and provides worst-case bounds of fi (f bd=2c ). This is in contrast to the results of Borgwardt <ref> [Borg] </ref>, who has established a polynomial bound of at most O (d 4 f ) for the expected number of steps of the shadow vertex algorithm on random linear programs.
