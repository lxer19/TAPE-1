Title: The Search for Coordination: Knowledge-Guided  
Abstract: ion and Search in a Hierarchical Behavior Space Abstract Coordination is a search process, where individuals must find appropriate activities that allow them to achieve individual and collective goals. In this paper, we motivate and summarize the elements of coordination search, and use these elements to highlight how traditionally distinct coordination techniques can be viewed as similar search processes but at different levels of abstraction. In particular, the temporal extents and relationships among activities leads to search as organizational design, as multiagent planning, or as distributed resource scheduling. We update the current status of some of our search techniques for coordination, emphasizing issues such as the effects of abstraction in controlling distributed search and how knowledge can be used in hypothesizing alternative activities. The practical implications of coordination search are briefly illustrated in the context of multirobot control and distributed meeting scheduling.

Reference-contexts: If it has set the stage well, it will reap the rewards, but if the stage is set wrong, the agent (and perhaps the others) will pay a price. By projecting models of itself, the agent is thus committing to possible future courses of interaction <ref> [1] </ref>. In a dynamic world, an unexpected situation might arise that changes the desirability of future courses of interaction. A way to deal with such changes is for the agents to engage in a flurry of communication/observation so as to modify their models of each other.

Reference-contexts: Distributed Planning/Scheduling. In this approach, agents periodically exchange modeling information, typically current plans, goals, or task schedules. They can use this information to revise their activities and to make communication decisions. For example, in partial global planning <ref> [5] </ref>, agents asynchronously exchange information about their current plans and goals, and each uses whatever information it has to modify its plans (to avoid redundant work or to provide useful results to another agent sooner) and to determine what information it has (or will have) that will be of interest to

Reference-contexts: The desire to commit at more abstract levels is not new, and in fact is a cornerstone assumption behind research in organizational structuring and sophisticated local control <ref> [6] </ref>. What we would like to emphasize, however, is that a major part of the process of coordination involves a search for what abstract levels to commit to, rather than assuming that agents know this ahead of time.

To reduce complexity because of bounded rationality, an agent might choose to model another agent differently, using less information.

Appropriate abstractions between these extremes hold the promise of dramatic reductions of search complexity, as briefly discussed previously (see <ref> [13] </ref> for more details). Decisions about how to construct the abstraction hierarchy thus have important ramifications to the costs and benefits of coordination search. 5.1.1 Line-of-Sight Decomposition. In the delivery domain, our first approach to generating the abstraction hierarchy was based on information generated during path planning.

Reference-contexts: Here, we will briefly summarize our progress. 5.2.1 Distributed Meeting Scheduling. Our initial work in formalizing the search process in distributed meeting scheduling considered the search at a single level of detail: Agents would propose and counterpropose meeting times in terms of specific intervals <ref> [15] </ref>. However, inherent in the meeting scheduling domain is rich knowledge about natural divisions in the search space. Since the search is over the space of a calendar, our algorithms can take advantage of natural divisions in a calendar, such as weekdays, weekends, weeks, months, and so on.
