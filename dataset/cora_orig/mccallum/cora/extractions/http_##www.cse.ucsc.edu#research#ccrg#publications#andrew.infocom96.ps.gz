Abstract: ified and analyzed. These protocols require: a separate channel for transmission of control packets, a fixed transmitter and receiver and a tunable transmitter and receiver. The distinction between these protocols and other WDM protocols is that message transmissions are initiated by the receipt of a control message; other schemes schedule packet transmission for some fixed point in the future. This flexibility allows these protocols to avoid "head-of-line" blocking, which is a problem encountered in some other protocols. The protocols presented here place no constraints on the size of a message, the size of a packet or on the number of available data channels; maintain a distributed queue for each of the output nodes; and guarantee that there are no receiver or data channel collisions. The delay characteristics of these protocols are analyzed and compared to those of the TTAS algorithm [3,11].

Reference-contexts: The access rate for a user of an optical network is limited by electronic speeds, which are only a few giga bits per second <ref> [1] </ref>; a WDM network allows for a more efficient use of the enormous capacity of an optical link by allowing concurrent transmissions. The nodes of a WDM network can be arranged around a passive star coupler using a broadcast-and-select transmission policy.

Reference-contexts: The new protocols allow variable-size messages, variable-size packets, and variable distance between the nodes and the coupler. Further more, the protocols impose no requirements on the number of transmission channels, and guarantee that there are no receiver or channel collisions. Like other channel access protocols for WDM net works <ref> [3, 7, 8] </ref>, DQMW uses a separate control chan nel for coordinating the transmission of data messages. Each node in the network receives every message sent along the control channel; this allows the individual nodes to maintain a consistent view of the current network state.

Reference-contexts: Current tunable transmitters and receivers all suffer from one of two problems: either the tuning time is too long, or the active range is too small. The commercially available (wide range) receivers require millisecond tuning times which is unacceptable for a viable packet switched network. A fast tunable laser <ref> [4] </ref> was demonstrated to switch between wavelengths in less than 8 ns; this laser was able to tune to 24 discrete frequencies. This switching time makes a packet-switched WDM network possible.

Reference-contexts: This switching time makes a packet-switched WDM network possible. However, many of the channel access protocols for WDM networks presented to date require a channel for each network node [8, 9, 10]. This severely limits the size of the network, considering that 144x144 port star couplers have been demonstrated <ref> [6] </ref>. For this reason, we focus on WDM networks with more nodes than data channels. The Transmitter Tune Ahead Scheduling (TTAS) algorithm is a member of the family of WDM protocols presented in [3,11].
