Abstract: For a general H 2 optimal control problem, at first all H 2 optimal measurement feedback controllers are characterized and parameterized, and then attention is focused on controllers with estimator based architecture. The H 2 optimal control problem with strictly proper controllers and the H 2 optimal control problem with proper controllers are essentially different and hence clearly delineated. Next, estimator based H 2 optimal controllers are characterized and parameterized. Also, systematic methods of designing them are presented. Three different estimator structures, prediction, current, and reduced order estimators, are considered. Since in general there exist many H 2 optimal measurement feedback controllers, utilizing such flexibility and freedom, one can place the closed-loop poles at more desirable locations while still preserving H 2 optimality. All the design algorithms developed here are easily computer implementable. 1 The work of Ali Saberi is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant ECS-9410897 2 The research of dr.

Reference-contexts: Also, (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995) developed the necessary and sufficient conditions under which an H 2 optimal measurement feedback controller exists. In <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>, a complete treatment of the H 2 optimal control problem was provided for the case when the entire state is available for feedback. More specifically, it characterized all H 2 optimal state feedback controllers including static as well as dynamic ones. <p> This set is called the set of H 2 optimal fixed modes. For any H 2 optimal state feedback, the closed-loop poles include the elements of this set. A significant aspect of the work in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref> is the development of a computation-ally feasible step by step algorithm called `Optimal Gains and Fixed Modes', abbreviated as (OGFM). <p> The intention of this paper is to fill this gap. In fact, the spirit of this paper is to capture, while using measurement feedback controllers rather than state feedback controllers, all the aspects of H 2 optimal control that were developed in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>. We characterize and parameterize estimator based H 2 optimal controllers while considering three different estimator structures: prediction, current, and reduced order estimators. <p> It can be checked that the set F fl s (A; B; E; C 2 ; D 2 ) equals the set F fl s (A; B; E; C P ; D P ) (see <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>). Also, throughout the paper, we use another set of gains defined as K fl s (A 0 ; C 0 2 ; E 0 Q )g: We have the following additional definition. <p> Utilization of the sets F fl s , K fl s , fl , and fl to form an appropriate H 2 optimal measurement feedback controller is discussed in the later sections. However, at this time, we like to emphasize that an algorithm called (OGFM) is developed in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref> to characterize and construct explicitly the set of state feedbacks F fl s , and its associated set of fixed modes fl . <p> We first choose a state feedback gain F from the set F fl s (A; B; E Q ; C P ; D P ). As shown in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>, such a state feedback gain F solves the DDPS for PQ . This leads us at first to study a basic question. <p> The set of prediction estimator fixed modes associated with F is given by fl PROOF. It is obvious. 2 19 It is important to note that both the sets K fl p (F ) and fl p (F ) can be constructed by the (OGFM) algorithm developed in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>. Next, we move on to consider the case when the subsystem 2PQ of PQ (or equivalently, the subsystem (A; B; C 2 ; D 2 ) of ) is not left-invertible. <p> PROOF. Parts (i) to (iii) are straightforward to check. Part (iv) is the tricky part. However, looking at the construction of the set fl in the (OGFM) algorithm given in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>, it is straightforward to establish this fact. 2 20 Part (iv) of the above lemma assures us that the set F fl s (A; B; E Q ; C P ; D P ) is sufficiently large in the sense that by focusing on this smaller set <p> Step 1: Consider the system PQ . Select a set fl s of n desired self-conjugate poles. Using (A; B; E Q ; C P ; D P ) as the input to (OGFM) algorithm of <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>, determine a state feedback gain F 2 F fl s (A; B; E Q ; C P ; D P ) such that (A + BF ) = fl s . <p> Step 2: Select a set fl e of n desired self-conjugate estimator poles. Let the gain F be as chosen in Step 1. Using the quintuple (A; E Q ; C 1 ; F; D Q ) as the input to the dual of (OGFM) algorithm of <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>, determine a gain K p 2 K fl s (A; E Q ; C 1 ; F; D Q ) such that (A + K p C 1 ) = fl e . <p> of the above equation, the rest of the proof follows along the same lines as the proof of Theorem 14. 2 Again, we note that the sets K fl c (F ) and fl c (F ) can be constructed by utilizing the dual of the (OGFM) algorithm developed in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>. <p> view of this, the rest of the proof follows along the same lines as the proof of Theorem 14. 2 Again, we note that the sets K fl r (F ) and fl r (F ) can be constructed by utilizing a dual version of the (OGFM) algorithm developed in <ref> (Chen et al. 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It becomes obvious from the development given in this paper that the second implication of the separation principle is in general not true either. This paper is the discrete-time version of the paper <ref> (Saberi et al. 1994) </ref>. Although there are some conceptual similarities between the H 2 optimal control problems for continuous- and discrete-time systems, there are several fundamental differences between them.

Reference-contexts: It says that, whenever an H 2 optimal static state feedback controller and an H 2 optimal state estimator exist, there exists as well an H 2 optimal estimator based measurement feedback controller. This first implication of the traditional separation principle is in general false as pointed out in <ref> (Stoorvogel 1992) </ref>. The second implication of the separation principle relates to the actual construction of an H 2 optimal measurement feedback controller. Suppose there exists an H 2 optimal measurement feedback controller.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the infimum over the class of strictly proper controllers is in general larger than the infimum over the class of proper controllers (in more classical references such as (Anderson & Moore 1979; Kwakernaak & Sivan 1972) this fact was not clearly presented). Also, <ref> (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995) </ref> developed the necessary and sufficient conditions under which an H 2 optimal measurement feedback controller exists. In (Chen et al. 1994), a complete treatment of the H 2 optimal control problem was provided for the case when the entire state is available for feedback. <p> Moreover, as said earlier, it turns out that in the case of discrete-time systems (but not for continuous-time systems) fl fl p is in general smaller than fl fl sp (see for details <ref> (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995) </ref>). As discussed in detail in (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995), the strictly proper H 2 optimal control problem for a given system can be reformulated as a disturbance decoupling problem via strictly proper measurement feedback with internal stability (DDPMS) for an auxiliary system denoted here by PQ . <p> Moreover, as said earlier, it turns out that in the case of discrete-time systems (but not for continuous-time systems) fl fl p is in general smaller than fl fl sp (see for details <ref> (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995) </ref>). As discussed in detail in (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995), the strictly proper H 2 optimal control problem for a given system can be reformulated as a disturbance decoupling problem via strictly proper measurement feedback with internal stability (DDPMS) for an auxiliary system denoted here by PQ . <p> We note that DDPS for PQ is characterized by the matrix quintuple (A; B; E Q ; C P ; D P ). The following lemma recalled from <ref> (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995) </ref> connects the strictly proper H 2 optimal control problem for with the strictly proper DDPMS for PQ . Such a reformulation plays a significant role in the rest of this paper. <p> Then, the controller C is a strictly proper H 2 optimal controller for if and only if it solves the DDPMS for PQ . The following lemma recalled from <ref> (Trentelman & Stoorvogel 1995) </ref> connects the proper H 2 optimal control problem for with the proper DDPMS for N PQ .

In this paper, we focus on utilizing the freedom in assigning the closed-loop poles.
