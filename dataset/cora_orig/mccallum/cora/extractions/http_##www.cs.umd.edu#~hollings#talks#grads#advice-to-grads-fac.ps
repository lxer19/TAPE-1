Title: How to Be a Good  
Author: Marie desJardins 
Degree: Graduate Student Advisor  
Date: March 1994  
Abstract: This paper attempts to raise some issues that are important for graduate students to be successful and to get as much out of the process as possible, and for advisors who wish to help their students be successful. The intent is not to provide prescriptive advice no formulas for finishing a thesis or twelve-step programs for becoming a better advisor are given but to raise awareness on both sides of the advisor-student relationship as to what the expectations are and should be for this relationship, what a graduate student should expect to accomplish, common problems, and where to go if the advisor is not forthcoming.

Reference-contexts: I hope that this article will provide information for both graduate students and advisors that will help make the process less painful. I owe a debt of gratitude to David Chapman, 1 whose paper ( <ref> [ Chapman, 1988 ] </ref> ) was an invalu-able reference for me not only during the writing of this article, but during graduate school as well. <p> I found this publication very informative both during graduate school and while writing this article.
