Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of constructing commitment schemes where the sender is bounded to polynomial time and the receiver may be all powerful. Many known constructions for such commitment schemes are based on the hardness of factoring large integers. However, these schemes typically use integers of a special form and thus require a rather expensive initialization procedure for establishing these special-form integers. In this paper we present a scheme which is based on the hardness of factoring large integers but avoids the need of a complex initialization procedure.

Reference-contexts: Blum's scheme calls for one or two modular multiplications and a k-bit commitment string for every bit which is being committed to (where k is the size of the composite modulus). A similar construction with the same efficiency parameters was later described by Brassard and Crepeau <ref> [1] </ref>. A more efficient construction, which is also based on the hardness of factoring large integers, is implicit in the work of Goldwasser, Micali and Rivest [11].

Reference-contexts: Their claw-free permutation-pairs enables one to commit to long messages using about the same amount of local computation as in Blum's scheme, but to send only a k-bit commitment string, regardless of the length of the message being committed to. This construction was described explicitly in <ref> [2] </ref> and was used since then in many other works (e.g. [3, 5, 8]). One common problem of all these constructions, however, is that they all rely on composite numbers of a special form (i.e., product of two primes which are both congruent to 3 mod 4). <p> In this paper we describe a method which also uses the GMR construction but avoids the need for this initialization step. Several other constructions in the literature are based on the difficulty of extracting discrete-logarithms. In particular, <ref> [2] </ref> also show how to use claw-free permutation-pairs which are based on the hardness of the discrete-log problem for commitment. This scheme, however, requires one modular exponentiation per message bit. <p> that for any s the function f N;s is also a permutations over the quadratic residues mod N . 3.2 Using the GMR Construction for Commitment The following is a simple commitment scheme that uses the GMR construction, which is essentially the same as the scheme which is described in <ref> [2] </ref>. We assume that the Sender and the Receiver uses some standard (prefix free) encoding function Enc so that for no two messages m 6= m 0 is Enc (m) a prefix of Enc (m 0 ).

Reference-contexts: In this work we concentrate on the case where the Sender is computationally bounded, but the Receiver may be all powerful. 1.1 Previous Work Many commitment schemes in the unbounded-receiver model are known based on number-theoretic constructions. The first such scheme was suggested by Blum <ref> [4] </ref> in the context of flipping coins over the phone. Blum described a commitment scheme for one bit, which is based on the hardness of factoring large integers.

There were also a few implementations of commitment-schemes using more generic complexity assumptions.

Reference-contexts: Claim 3.2: If the Factorization Conjecture holds, then the above scheme satisfies the Non-ambiguity requirement in Definition 1, provided that the composite N is chosen by a trusted third party. This claim was proven in [11] (Theorem 1) and a generalization of it was proven in <ref> [6] </ref> (Theorem 2.8). <p> In terms of running time, to compute the commitment string the Sender needs to perform one or two modular multiplications for every bit in s (which presumably has about the same length as m). Using a construction similar to <ref> [6] </ref>, we can use larger families of permutations to reduce the number of multiplication to one or two per byte of s. The idea is to use 256 different permutations rather than just two, and to view m as a sequence of bytes, where each byte specifies one permutation.

Reference-contexts: There were also a few implementations of commitment-schemes using more generic complexity assumptions. A "folklore" scheme in the bounded receiver (and unbounded sender) model, uses a hard-core bit of any one-way permutation and requires one application of the one-way permutation for each bit which is being committed to (cf. <ref> [14] </ref>). In the same model, Naor [18] presented a commitment scheme which can be implemented using any pseudo-random generator (or, equivalently, any one-way function [17]). As opposed to the previous schemes, however, Naor's scheme is interactive, and it requires 2 rounds of communication to commit to a string.
