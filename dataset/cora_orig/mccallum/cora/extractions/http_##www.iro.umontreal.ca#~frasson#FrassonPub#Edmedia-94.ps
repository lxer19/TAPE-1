Abstract: industrial formation requires specific tools and architecture. The Safari project aims at developing various architectures with different levels of complexity and also a methodology. Creating tutoring systems remains difficult for various reasons : the different components of their architecture are not stabilized, the structure and type of knowledge to be used are of different granularity and complex to handle, they require multiple expertise which is difficult to integrate. However, the utility of tutoring systems having more or less intelligent capabilities is obvious. Most of intelligent tutoring systems have been experimented in academic domains such as mathematics, physics, programming. But do we lack of teachers in such domains ? Is it crucial for improving the present training in universities or colleges ? On the other hand, there is a global market competition in the industry, skills are rapidly evolving (sometimes in complexity) with new technical environment and specialized knowledge, and employees must acquire new functions and knowhows in limited time. The need of training tools for this context is high. Experimenting and developing this category of tools appears different from the prototypes developed for academic courses. Scale of implementation, nature of problems, type of knowledge and expected functionalities are different. This is why we have specialized our research on industrial formation with "Safari". Safari is a project under the auspices of Synergie, a programme sponsored by the Ministry of Technology and Science of the Governement of Qubec. The main objectives of Synergie are (1) to enhance cooperative research and development between universities and industry, (2) to accelerate the product development cycle, (3) to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between research establishments and the industry, and (4) to educate highly qualified professionals in the domain. Safari involves four Qubec universities, two private enterprises and a government agency. The industrial partners are Virtual Prototypes Inc., providing a software package VAPS, and Novasys Inc. VAPS (Virtual Applications Prototyping System) is a high-quality commercial interface-building and simulation system, used in many areas (such as airline cockpit design).
