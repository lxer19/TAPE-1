Abstract: Nous donnons d'abord une definition geometrique intrinseque des con-traintes algebriques que les solutions doivent satisfaire, tout en explicitant un moyen effectif de les calculer. On aboutit a une decomposition de l'espace des y en sous-varietes algebriques irreductibles, ou l'on peut definir l'indice du systeme, invariant sur cette variete. Celui-ci correspond au nombre de derivations necessaire pour trouver une EDO de rang maximal sous-jacente au systeme initial. Abstract To study existence of solutions to quasi-linear differential-algebraic equations with polynomial coefficients, we use commutative algebra. First we emphasize the solutions to such systems have constraints to stand, and we give a way to compute those constraints. It means the study has to be carried out on an algebraic variety. We define the so-called index of the differential-algebraic equation and interpret it as the minimal number of differentiations needed to obtain an underlying ODE of maximal rank. Then we define regular points and eventually answer the questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions at such points, using a reduced and simpler local form of the system. An algorithm summarizes our approach.

Reference-contexts: There are effective but expensive algorithms to answer this question (refer for example to Becker& Weispfenning's book <ref> [1] </ref>). To end this report we present an informal algorithm that summarizes the study of a general quasi-linear DAE (see algorithm 5.1). Here are some comments about. * Preparation Step : we use the method described in section 1 to compute the variety G 0 .

Reference-contexts: Its kernel is the C [T; Y ]-module K. Let r be the rank of A. If r &lt; n, the rows of A are not C [T; Y ]-linearly independent : let R be a relations matrix for the rows of A (see Brown <ref> [2] </ref> p116), whose rows form a basis of K : it implies that R is a polynomial (n r) fi n-matrix.

Then we shall see it is a generalization of the differential index introduced by Gear in <ref> [6] </ref>. Theorem 3.1. Let (A; b) be a quasi-linear DAE with polynomial coefficients. There exists a k 2 f0; : : : ; ng such that the sequence (G i ) is stationnary for i k 1 and strictly decreasing for i &lt; k 1. <p> If some of the algebraic constraints don't belong to I j1 , u j &lt; n r j , G j 6= G j1 and j is not the index. 2 8 3.3 Connection with the differential index Now we recall the definition of the differential index (Gear <ref> [6] </ref>). Definition 3.2. Consider an implicit differential equation F (t; y; y 0 ) = 0 where F is a sufficiently differentiable map from C fi C n fi C n to C n , and y 0 = dy=dt. The differential index is defined by : 1.
