The analysis of the half-degree rule is related to Theorem 3 since it involves the distribution of D <ref> [1] </ref> . However, it only depends on areas where the Dickman function trivializes so that a direct argument applies. Lemma 2. The expected value of for the half-degree rule satisfies, as n ! 1, (HD) 5 n 3 : Proof. We now have (HD) = P k . <p> The expected value of for the half-degree rule satisfies, as n ! 1, (HD) 5 n 3 : Proof. We now have (HD) = P k . It suffices to consider the difference 0 = (B) (HD) = n=2&lt;kn d 2 k . If the largest degree D <ref> [1] </ref> n satisfies D [1] n n=2, we have 0 = 0. Otherwise we have 0 = (D [1] [1] n ) 2 since there can be only one factor of degree larger than n=2, namely D [1] n . <p> We now have (HD) = P k .

It suffices to consider the difference 0 = (B) (HD) = n=2&lt;kn d 2 k . If the largest degree D <ref> [1] </ref> n satisfies D [1] n n=2, we have 0 = 0. Otherwise we have 0 = (D [1] [1] n ) 2 since there can be only one factor of degree larger than n=2, namely D [1] n . <p> We now have (HD) = P k . It suffices to consider the difference 0 = (B) (HD) = n=2&lt;kn d 2 k . If the largest degree D <ref> [1] </ref> n satisfies D [1] n n=2, we have 0 = 0.

In this paper, we provide a complete average-case analysis of this basic polynomial factorization chain which, despite its simplicity, does not appear to have been completely analysed previously.

We fix a finite field F q with q = p m (p prime) and consider the polynomial ring F q [x], see <ref> [20, 31, 34] </ref>. The probabilistic model assumes all q n monic polynomials of degree n to be equally likely and all average-case analyses are expressed as asymptotic forms in n, the degree of the polynomial to be factored. <p> The last part of the algorithm adds to h the factors in g with repetitions eliminated. The auxiliary computation of pth roots, g 1=p , is performed in the classical way <ref> [20, p. 344] </ref>, using the identity (a p + b p ) 1=p = (a + b). In order to obtain the complete factorization it is sufficient to recursively call ERF with the input polynomial f=h.
