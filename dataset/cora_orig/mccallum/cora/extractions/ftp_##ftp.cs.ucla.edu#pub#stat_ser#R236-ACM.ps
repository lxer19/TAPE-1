Reference-contexts: This problem has been lingering in the statistical literature since Karl Pearson, the founder of modern statistics, discovered (1899) what in modern terms is called the "Simpson's paradox"; any statistical association between two variables may be reversed or negated by including additional factors in the analysis <ref> [Aldrich, 1995] </ref>. 15 almost unconstrained, causal knowledge imposes very specific preferences as to which worlds should be considered closest to any given world. For example, considering an array of domino tiles standing close to each other.

Reference-contexts: A related formulation of causal effects, based on event trees and counterfactual analysis was developed by Robins (1986, pp. 1422-25). Calculi for actions and counterfactuals based on this interpretation are developed in [Pearl, 1994b] and <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994] </ref>, respectively. 5 Counterfactuals A counterfactual sentence has the form If A were true, then C would have been true? where A, the counterfactual antecedent, specifies an event that is contrary to one's real-world observations, and C, the counterfactual consequent, specifies a result that is expected to hold <p> Unlike causal effect queries, counterfactual queries are not identifiable even in Markovian theories, but require that the functional-form of ff i g be specified. In <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994] </ref> a method is devised for computing sharp bounds on counterfactual probabilities which, under certain circumstances may collapse to point estimates.

Reference-contexts: He developed a method called Path Analysis [Wright, 1934], which later became an established representation of causal models in economics [Wold, 1964], sociology <ref> [Blalock, 1971, Kenny, 1979] </ref>, and psychology [Duncan, 1975]. Good (1961) used DAGs to represent causal hierarchies of binary variables with disjunctive causes. Influence diagrams represent another application of DAG representation [Howard and Matheson, 1981]. Developed for decision analysis, they contain both event nodes and decision nodes.

Reference-contexts: Finally, when the propagation process subsides, the posterior probability of an individual variable is computed by projecting (marginalizing) the distribution of the hosting clique onto this variable. While the task of updating probabilities in general networks is NP-hard <ref> [Rosenthal, 1977, Cooper, 1990] </ref>, the complexity for each of the three methods cited above is exponential in the size of the largest clique found in some triangulation of the network.

Reference-contexts: effects are identifiable even in situations where members of pa j are unobservable [Pearl, 1993a] and, moreover, polynomial tests are now available for deciding when P (x i j^x j ) is identifiable, and for deriving closed-form expressions for P (x i j^x j ) in terms of observed quantities <ref> [Galles and Pearl, 1995] </ref>. These tests and derivations are based on a symbolic calculus [Pearl, 1994b, 1995] to be described in the sequel, in which interventions, side by side with observations, are given explicit notation, and are permitted to transform probability expressions.

Reference-contexts: The d-separation criterion has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient relative to the set of distributions that are represented by a DAG G <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1990, Geiger et al., 1990] </ref>. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of independencies implied by the recursive decomposition of Eq. (1) and the set of triples 4 (X; Z; Y ) that satisfy the d-separation criterion in G. <p> The soundness of the d-separation criterion holds not only for probabilistic independencies but for any abstract notion of conditional independence that obeys the semi-graphoid axioms <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1990, Geiger et al., 1990] </ref>. <p> Independencies can be dealt with explicitly. They can be articulated by an expert, encoded graphically, read off the network, and reasoned about; yet they forever remain robust to numerical imprecision <ref> [Geiger, 1990, Geiger et al., 1990, Pearl et al., 1990] </ref>. 3. Graphical representations uncover opportunities for efficient computation.

Reference-contexts: Such sentences, often named plain beliefs, exhibit both logical and probabilistic character. As in classical logic, they are propositional and deductively closed; as in probability, they are subject to retraction and to varying degrees of entrenchment <ref> [Spohn, 1988, Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992] </ref>. Bayesian networks can be adopted to model the dynamics of plain beliefs by replacing ordinary probabilities with non-standard probabilities, that is, probabilities that are infinitesimally close to either zero or one. <p> Extensions to action representation in nonmonotonic systems were reported in <ref> [Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992, Pearl, 1993a] </ref>. Graphical ramifications of this translation were explicated first in Spirtes et al. (1993) and later in Pearl (1993b). A related formulation of causal effects, based on event trees and counterfactual analysis was developed by Robins (1986, pp. 1422-25).

Reference-contexts: The connection is made in the mechanism-based account of causation. The basic idea behind this account goes back to structural equations models <ref> [Wright, 1921, Haavelmo, 1943, Simon, 1953] </ref> and it was adapted in [Pearl and Verma, 1991] for defining probabilistic causal theories, as follows.

Reference-contexts: Their basic properties and capabilities can be summarized as follows: 1. Graphical methods make it easy to maintain consistency and completeness in probabilistic knowledge bases. They also define modular procedures of knowledge acquisition that reduce significantly the number of assessments required <ref> [Pearl, 1988, Heckerman, 1991] </ref>. 2. Independencies can be dealt with explicitly. They can be articulated by an expert, encoded graphically, read off the network, and reasoned about; yet they forever remain robust to numerical imprecision [Geiger, 1990, Geiger et al., 1990, Pearl et al., 1990]. 3.

The idea was to assign each variable a simple processor, forced to communicate only with its neighbors, and to permit asynchronous back-and-forth message-passing until equilibrium was achieved. <p> Graphical representations uncover opportunities for efficient computation.

Reference-contexts: The majority of the philosophers who have examined the semantics of counterfactual sentences have resorted to some version of Lewis' "closest world" approach; "C if it were A" is true, if C is true in worlds that are "closest" to the real world yet consistent with the counterfactuals antecedent A <ref> [Lewis, 1973] </ref>. Ginsberg (1986), followed a similar strategy. <p> It is for this reason that one must invoke some notion of intervention (alternatively, a theory change or a "miracle" <ref> [Lewis, 1973] </ref>) in the definition of counterfactuals. If U is treated as a random variable, then the value of the counterfactual Y (x; u) becomes a random variable as well, denoted as Y (x) of Y x .

Reference-contexts: Section 4.3 will demonstrate that certain causal effects, though not all, are identifiable even when the Markovian property is destroyed by introducing dependencies among the disturbance terms. Generalization to multiple actions and conditional actions are reported in <ref> [Pearl and Robins, 1995] </ref>. Multiple actions do (X = x), where X is a compound variable result in a distribution similar to (12), except that all factors corresponding to the variables in X are removed from the product in (11).

Reference-contexts: The potential for the network to work as a computational architecture, and hence as a model of cognitive activities, was noted in <ref> [Pearl, 1982] </ref>, where a distributed scheme was demonstrated for probabilistic updating on tree-structured networks. The motivation behind this particular development was the modeling of distributed processing in reading comprehension [Rumelhart, 1976], where both top-down and bottom-up inferences are combined to form a coherent interpretation. <p> their applications to evidential reasoning in expert systems are discussed in [Pearl, 1988, Pearl et al., 1990, Geiger, 1990, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988, Spiegelhalter et al., 1993, Pearl, 1993a]. 3.2 Inference Algorithms The first algorithms proposed for probability updating in Bayesian networks used message-passing architecture and were limited to trees <ref> [Pearl, 1982] </ref> and singly connected networks [Kim and Pearl, 1983]. The idea was to assign each variable a simple processor, forced to communicate only with its neighbors, and to permit asynchronous back-and-forth message-passing until equilibrium was achieved. <p> Graphical representations uncover opportunities for efficient computation. Distributed updating is feasible in knowledge structures which are rich enough to exhibit intercausal interactions (e.g., "explaining away") <ref> [Pearl, 1982, Kim and Pearl, 1983] </ref> And, when extended by clustering or conditioning, tree-propagation algorithms are capable of up dating networks of arbitrary topology [Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988, Shachter, 1986, Pearl, 1988]. 4.

Among the most popular are Shachter's (1988) method of node elimination, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter's (1988) method of clique-tree propagation, and the method of loop-cut conditioning <ref> [Pearl, 1988, Chapter 4.3] </ref>. Clique-tree propagation, the most popular of the three methods, works as follows. Starting with a directed network representation, the network is transformed into an undirected graph that retains all of its original dependencies. <p> Clique-tree propagation, the most popular of the three methods, works as follows. Starting with a directed network representation, the network is transformed into an undirected graph that retains all of its original dependencies. This graph, sometimes called a Markov network <ref> [Pearl, 1988, Chapter 3.1] </ref>, is then triangulated to form local clusters of nodes (cliques) that are tree-structured.

Their basic properties and capabilities can be summarized as follows: 1. Graphical methods make it easy to maintain consistency and completeness in probabilistic knowledge bases. They also define modular procedures of knowledge acquisition that reduce significantly the number of assessments required [Pearl, 1988, Heckerman, 1991]. 2. <p> Their basic properties and capabilities can be summarized as follows: 1.

The causal information encoded in Bayesian networks facilitates the analysis of action sequences, their consequences, their interaction with observations, their expected utilities and, hence, the synthesis of plans and strategies under uncertainty [Dean and Wellman, 1991, Pearl, 1993b, Pearl, 1994b]. 6. <p> The method is not limited to linear functions but applies whenever we are willing to assume the functional form of the structural equations. The noisy OR-gate model <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref> is a canonical example where such functional form is normally specified. Likewise, causal theories based on Boolean functions (with exceptions), such as the one described in Eq. (16) lend themselves to counterfactual analysis in the framework of Definition 5.1.

Reference-contexts: The d-separation criterion has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient relative to the set of distributions that are represented by a DAG G <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1990, Geiger et al., 1990] </ref>. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of independencies implied by the recursive decomposition of Eq. (1) and the set of triples 4 (X; Z; Y ) that satisfy the d-separation criterion in G. <p> An important property that follows from the d-separation characterization is a criterion for determining when two dags are observationally equivalent, that is, every probability distribution that is represented by one of the dags is also represented by the other: Theorem 3.2 <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1990] </ref> Two dags are observationally equivalent if and only if they have the same sets of edges and the same sets of v-structures, that is, head-to-head arrows with non-adjacent tails . <p> The soundness of the d-separation criterion holds not only for probabilistic independencies but for any abstract notion of conditional independence that obeys the semi-graphoid axioms <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1990, Geiger et al., 1990] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Influence diagrams represent another application of DAG representation [Howard and Matheson, 1981]. Developed for decision analysis, they contain both event nodes and decision nodes. Recursive models is the name given to such networks by statisti 2 cians seeking meaningful and effective decompositions of contingency tables <ref> [Lauritzen, 1982, Wermuth and Lauritzen, 1983, Kiiveri et al., 1984] </ref>. The role of the network in the applications above was primarily to provide an efficient description for probability functions; once the network was configured, all subsequent computations were pursued by symbolic manipulation of probability expressions.

Reference-contexts: He developed a method called Path Analysis [Wright, 1934], which later became an established representation of causal models in economics <ref> [Wold, 1964] </ref>, sociology [Blalock, 1971, Kenny, 1979], and psychology [Duncan, 1975]. Good (1961) used DAGs to represent causal hierarchies of binary variables with disjunctive causes. Influence diagrams represent another application of DAG representation [Howard and Matheson, 1981]. Developed for decision analysis, they contain both event nodes and decision nodes.

Reference-contexts: The connection is made in the mechanism-based account of causation. The basic idea behind this account goes back to structural equations models <ref> [Wright, 1921, Haavelmo, 1943, Simon, 1953] </ref> and it was adapted in [Pearl and Verma, 1991] for defining probabilistic causal theories, as follows.
