Abstract: ATM Forum Document Number: ATM Forum/96-1172 ******************************************************************************* Title: ERICA Switch Algorithm: A Complete Description ******************************************************************************* Abstract: The ERICA switch algorithm has been discussed extensively in TM group in the past. However, over the last two years, the algorithm has been substantially modified. This contribution describes the current version of ERICA switch algorithm in complete detail. The algorithm achieves both efficiency and fairness, and exhibits a fast transient response. The development of the algorithm is traced, and the new approaches it uses to achieve its objectives are highlighted. Several design and implementation aspects of the algorithm are examined. In addition, several enhancements to the algorithm are proposed and studied. ******************************************************************************* Source: Raj Jain, Shiv Kalyanaraman, Rohit Goyal, Sonia Fahmy, and Ram Viswanathan The Ohio State University Department of CIS Columbus, OH 43210 Phone: 614-292-3989, Fax: 614-292-2911, Email: Jain@CIS.Ohio-State.Edu The presentation of this contribution at ATM Forum is sponsored by NASA. ******************************************************************************* Date: August 1996 ******************************************************************************* Distribution: ATM Forum Technical Working Group Members (Traffic Management) ******************************************************************************* Notice: This contribution has been prepared to assist the ATM Forum.

Reference-contexts: When a source receives a BRM, it computes its allowed cell rate (ACR) using current ACR, 5 CI, NI, BN flags, and the ER field of the RM cell. For a detailed explaination of source and end system behavior, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 The ERICA Algorithm The ERICA algorithm is concerned with the fair and efficient allocation of the available bandwidth to all contending sources. Like any dynamic resource algorithm, it requires monitoring the available capacity and the current demand on the resources.
