Reference-contexts: It provides the operations of the class Collection and an initialization operation. The class WinningTicket will be a subtype of Ticket and have an extra operation that compares a ticket and returns the number of matches. It is possible to specify probability distributions in a very general framework <ref> [1, Chapter 21] </ref>. For the sake of brevity we settle for something simplier: a class UniformDiscrete, whose abstract value is a stream of random integers from 1 to a given size. <p> classVariableNames: '' poolDictionaries: '' ! !ProbabilityDistribution methods ! next ^ self implementedBySubclass! ! program, it makes sense to add it because we already imagine having other probability distributions, and because it is painful to change the superclass of a class in Smalltalk. (See Chapter 21 of Goldberg and Robson's book <ref> [1] </ref> for a comprehensive treatment of probability distributions in Smalltalk.) 3.4 Uniform Discrete The class UniformDiscrete is presented in Figure 4. It is a subclass of ProbabilityDistribution.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the class LottoCustomer will have as its abstract value a bag of tickets, and money representing its loss or gain. It will have an operation to report its winnings (or loss). The implementations of these classes follows. 3 Implementation The following code is written for Smalltalk/V <ref> [3] </ref> (also known as Smalltalk Express). The code shown is directly taken from the files that create the system; hence it is in the Smalltalk "file out" format.
