Abstract: In this paper we present a new technique for partial surface and volume matching of images in three dimensions. In this problem, we are given two objects in 3-space, each represented as a set of points, scattered uniformly along its boundary or inside its volume. The goal is to find a rigid motion of one object which makes a sufficiently large portion of its boundary lying sufficiently close to a corresponding portion of the boundary of the second object. Our method treats separately the rotation and the translation components of the Euclidean motion that we seek, and compares favorably with previous techniques. Experimental results on various examples, involving data from industrial applications and from molecular biology, are presented, and show the accurate performance of our algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The problem of detecting structural motifs in proteins was traditionally tackled by string matching techniques, applied to the primary structures of the proteins [SK]. Other, more enhanced methods <ref> [RK, AM1, MARW] </ref> searched for the existence of predefined motifs in the secondary protein structures. The most advanced geometrically-oriented techniques for both problems apply geometric hashing to the tertiary protein structures [NW, FBNW]. We propose a new approach to the matching problem, and present several applications of it.

Reference-contexts: Important applications of molecule docking are the recognition and binding of receptors and ligands, and synthetic drug design. Partial volume matching can also aid in the detection of structural motifs in proteins <ref> [AM2] </ref>. Yet another motivation is the combination of several snapshots of the same object, taken from different view points, in order to obtain a description of a bigger portion of its boundary. This has obvious industrial, civil and military applications (e.g. decoding of aerial photographs).

Reference-contexts: The image may contain several partially-occluded copies of the model objects. This is acknowledged by many researchers as a major problem in object recognition (cf. <ref> [BJ, p. 137] </ref>). The goal is to find a Euclidean motion of a model object, which makes it overlap a large portion of some object in the image, leading to the identification of the model object in the viewed scene, and to finding its position and orientation there. <p> Other methods, which do not rely on the existence of a certain type of features, are pose-clustering [St], alignment [HU], and, of course, geometric hashing. A comparison between these techniques is found in [Wo1]. Comprehensive surveys on partial surface matching techniques in computer vision are found in <ref> [BJ, CD] </ref>. "Relatively little work has been published in the area of registration (pose estima tion, alignment, motion estimation) of 3-D free-form shapes, and most of the existing literature addressing global shape matching or registration have addressed limited classes of shapes" [BM].

Reference-contexts: Due to lack of space, we cannot review in depth the extensive existing literature, mostly in computer vision and pattern recognition, on surface and volume matching. Some works (e.g. <ref> [BH] </ref>) depend on the ability to match significant features of the objects, like knobs and holes, whose existence is not usually guaranteed. Other methods, which do not rely on the existence of a certain type of features, are pose-clustering [St], alignment [HU], and, of course, geometric hashing.

Other methods might converge to a motion that yields only a local minimum of their `scoring function', etc.
