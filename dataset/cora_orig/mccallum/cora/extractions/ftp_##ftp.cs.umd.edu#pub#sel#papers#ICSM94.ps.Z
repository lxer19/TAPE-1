Abstract: In order to improve software maintenance processes, we need to be able to first characterize and assess them. This task needs to be performed in depth and with objectivity since the problems are complex. One approach is to set up a measurement program specifically aimed at maintenance. However, establishing a measurement program requires that one understands the issues and is able to characterize the maintenance environment and processes in order to collect suitable and cost-effective data. Also, enacting such a program and getting usable data sets takes time . A short term substitute is needed. We propose in this paper a characterization process aimed specifically at maintenance and based on a general qualitative analysis methodology. This process is rigorously defined in order to be repeatable and usable by people who are not acquainted with such analysis procedures. A basic feature of our approach is that maintenance changes are analyzed in order to understand the flaws in the change process. Guidelines are provided and a case study is shown that demonstrates the usefulness of the approach.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As described in <ref> [HV92] </ref>, numerous factors can affect software maintenance quality and productivity, e.g., the maintenance personnel experience profile and training, the way knowledge about the maintained systems is managed and conveyed to the maintainers and users, the maintenance organization, processes and standards in use, the initial quality of the software source code and

Reference-contexts: Establishing a measurement program integrated into the maintenance process is likely to help any organization achieve an in-depth understanding of its specific maintenance issues and thereby lay a solid foundation for maintenance process improvement <ref> [RUV92] </ref>. However, defining and enacting a measurement program may take time and a short term, quickly operational substitute is needed in order to obtain a first quick insight, at low cost, into the issues to be addressed.

Reference-contexts: In order to reach such an objective, we will base the design of such a measurement program on the results provided by this study. In addition, we need to model more rigorously the maintenance organization and processes so that precise evaluation criteria can be defined <ref> [SB94] </ref>. This approach will be used to analyze several other maintenance projects in the NASA-SEL in order to better understand project similarities and differences in this environment. Thus, we will be able to build better models of the various classes of maintenance projects.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a qualitative and inductive analysis methodology for performing objective project characterizations and thereby identifying their specific problems and needs. It is an implementation of the general qualitative analysis methodology defined in <ref> [SS92] </ref>. It encompasses a set of procedures which aids the determination of causal links between maintenance problems and flaws of the maintenance organization and process. Thus, a set of concrete steps for maintenance quality and productivity improvement can be taken based on a tangible understanding of the relevant maintenance issues. <p> However, this approach could be easily augmented to integrate data collection and analysis and could thus provide more quantitative information (but at a higher cost). 2 . 1 A Qualitative Analysis Process This characterization process is essentially an instantiation of the generic qualitative analysis process defined in <ref> [SS92] </ref>. Figure 1 illustrates at a high level our maintenance specific analysis process. It is a combination of both inductive and deductive inferences. Inductive inferences are made from the collected information. Deductive inferences occur when experimentally validating and refining our taxonomies, process models, organizational models and working hypotheses. <p> The pieces of information which compose the ODB are given in decreasing order of importance at each step. The order and content of the ODB varies at each step since the analysis focus shifts progressively <ref> [SS92] </ref>. Step 1: Model organizational structures Input: maintenance standards definition document, interviews, sample of release documents, organization chart Output: organization model (roles, agents, teams, information flow, etc.) Validation: . Are all the standard documents and artifacts included in the modeled information flow? .
