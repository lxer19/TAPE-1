Abstract: We discuss a new minimum density objective for spanning and Steiner tree constructions. This formulation is motivated by the minimum-area layout objective, which is best achieved through balancing the usage of horizontal and vertical routing resources. We present two efficient heuristics for constructing low-density spanning trees and prove that their outputs are on average within small constants of optimal with respect to both tree cost and density. Our proof techniques suggest a non-uniform lower bound schema which can afford tighter estimates of solution quality for a given problem instance. Furthermore, the minimum density objective can be transparently combined with a number of previous interconnection objectives (e.g., minimizing tree radius or skew) without affecting solution quality with respect to these previous metrics. Extensive simulation results suggest that applications to VLSI global routing are promising.

Reference-contexts: Our density criterion recalls the notion of trees with "low stabbing number", which are used in the computational geometry literature to speed up dynamic "ray shooting" queries <ref> [1] </ref> [7] [12] [13] [23]. However, our work differs from these computational geometry results in several important respects. <p> By contrast, our algorithms guarantee O (n 2 ) density, and run in O (n log n) time and O (n) space. Finally, Agarwal <ref> [1] </ref> showed that there always exists a family of O (log n) trees such that for an arbitrary given line, one of the trees will have a stabbing number of O ( p n); this family can be computed in time O (n 3 2 polylog).

Reference-contexts: "compatible" with existing performance-driven routing objectives, so that we may simultaneously address up to three separate routing tree measures. 11 4.1 Minimizing Skew, Density, and Total Wirelength Recall from Section 1 that construction of an interconnection tree with minimum difference among the various source-sink pathlengths captures both minimum-skew clock routing <ref> [3] </ref> and global routing with min-max timing constraints. The work of [17] gives a general interconnection scheme that achieves extremely small pathlength skews, while keeping the total wirelength on average within a constant factor of optimal, and always bounded by O ( p n).
