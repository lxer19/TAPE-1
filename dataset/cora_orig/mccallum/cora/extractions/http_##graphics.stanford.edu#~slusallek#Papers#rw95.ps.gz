Title: Smart Links and Efficient Reconstruction for Wavelet Radiosity  
Author: Philipp Slusallek Michael Schroder Marc Stamminger Hans-Peter Seidel 
Affiliation: Computer Graphics Group, University of Erlangen  
Abstract: Wavelet radiosity is the unification of two important methods to solve the radiosity equation: hierarchical radiosity and Galerkin radiosity. Although wavelet radiosity can reap the benefits of both methods, there is still a lot of overhead and in practice several problems occur. For example, using Haar wavelets the traditional push-pull scheme leads to obviously wrong results near common patch boundaries. Moreover, interaction between partially visible patches leads to unnecessarily fine subdivisions, and higher order wavelets introduce a significant overhead for low-power links. In this article we propose a set of smart links that cope with these problems and can increase both the efficiency of the algorithm and the quality of the solution. Additionally, we show how the expensive traditional reconstruction step that is required for piecewise constant basis functions can be avoided in the case of flatlets.

Reference-contexts: These M 2 sample values are an equivalent representation of the subpatch's radiosity. They are multiplied with the corresponding shadow mask values and transformed back to multiwavelet coefficients. To decrease the memory consumption we combine shadow masks with the idea of final gathering <ref> [1] </ref>. In all but the last iteration step, radiosity is gathered by a simple link that approximately considers visibility. Just in the last step the complete gathering procedure as described above is performed. <p> This results in a blocky radiosity solution, which requires an additional reconstruction or interpolation step before the radiosity can be used for rendering. A very good and general, but expensive reconstruction technique is final gathering <ref> [1] </ref>. In this chapter we propose a cheap alternative for flatlets. In the case of flatlets the calculation of the interaction integral (4) is very expensive, because the dual basis functions are difficult to handle. Therefore, Schroder et al. [9] suggested a basis change.

Reference-contexts: Quick Links A better solution, which we call quick links, is illustrated in Figure 10. Quick links are restricted to the four interactions between the constant basis function of the sender and the four constant and linear basis functions of the receiver. This idea is similar to substructuring in <ref> [2] </ref>. Radiosity is gathered by these quick links as a bilinear function. This avoids the occurrence of discontinuous blocks in the radiosity solution. In our implementation quick links are used if the transported power between two patches is below a certain threshold.

Reference-contexts: This is possible, but we made the experience that the time needed to determine the orders of the kernel exceeds the time saved due to lower-order integrations. In <ref> [3] </ref> Gershbein uses a similar idea to reduce the order of the quadrature rule by considering the order of the radiosity of the sending patch and not of the kernel function.

Reference-contexts: For piecewise constant basis functions they are identical to the well known form factors of classical radiosity <ref> [4] </ref>. In general, the interaction coefficients are defined as I i;j = p q where ~ N i (s) are the dual basis functions to N i (s).

Reference-contexts: We restrict ourselves to wavelet radiosity with tree wavelets (namely multiwavelets and flatlets), because the wavelet radiosity algorithm simplifies significantly for this wavelet type. In Section 2 we give a brief overview of the radiosity method with tree wavelets as proposed by Gortler et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, before we describe the use of double links to eliminate obviously wrong results near common patch boundaries in Section 3. In Section 4 we introduce a new integration method (boundary interpolation) and the shadow mask link type to address problems in the case of partial visibility. <p> This algorithm is very similar to hierarchical Radiosity (HR). As in HR after each gathering step it is necessary to consolidate the radiosity gathered at different levels of the multi-resolution hierarchy (push-pull procedure). A more detailed description of the algorithm can be found in <ref> [5] </ref> or [9]. 3 Double Links for Hierarchical Radiosity Near Singularities between two perpendicular patches of size 1 fi 5 obtained with Haar wavelets. One problem of the hierarchical radiosity algorithm arises near the singularities of adjacent patches.

Reference-contexts: Because of similarity F a 1 !b 1 is the same as F a!b and further subdivision with additional links is required. Note that this is also true if the oracle measures the variation of the form factor, as described in <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For these form factors good approximations or even closed-form solutions <ref> [10] </ref> are available. However, with this "symmetric" formula radiosity is gathered in the dual flatlet basis. The dual coefficients can be transformed back to the standard basis using the dual version of the push operation.

Reference-contexts: In Galerkin radiosity (GR) <ref> [12] </ref> B p (s) is approximated by a function from a function space spanned by a finite set of basis functions fN i (s)g: B p (s) P i b i N i (s). This approximated radiosity is described by the finite set of coeffi cients b p i . <p> It is especially useful for linear multiwavelets, but it also works with higher order multiwavelets. However, for higher orders the interpolation starts to exhibit ripples near the shadow boundary again. 4.2 Shadow masks In <ref> [12] </ref> Zatz introduced shadow masks to improve Galerkin radiosity calculations in the presence of shadow boundaries. Although the idea is simple, the implementation in Galerkin radiosity is quite tricky. As shown in this section, wavelet radiosity allows a simpler implementation of shadow masks. <p> The problem in Galerkin radiosity is how to multiply the gathered radiosity with the shadow mask. If the multiplication is done within the normal basis most information of the shadow mask is lost, so other ways have to be found <ref> [12] </ref>. In wavelet radiosity the multiplication can be performed using a finer resolution: In the first step radiosity is gathered with interactions that do not consider visibility. Then this radiosity is pushed down in the radiosity tree to the desired resolution.
