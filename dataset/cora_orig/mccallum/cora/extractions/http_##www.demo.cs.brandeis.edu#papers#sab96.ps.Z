Abstract: Many problems impede the design of multi-agent systems, not the least of which is the passing of information between agents. While others hand implement communication routes and semantics, we explore a method by which communication can evolve. In the experiments described here, we model agents as connectionist networks. We supply each agent with a number of communications channels implemented by the addition of both input and output units for each channel. The output units initiate environmental signals whose amplitude decay over distance and are perturbed by environmental noise. An agent does not receive input from other individuals, rather the agents input reects the summation of all other agents output signals along that channel. Because we use real-valued activations, the agents communicate using real-valued vectors. Under our evolutionary program, GNARL, the agents coevolve a communication scheme over continuous channels which conveys task-spe cific information.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we make no architectural distinctions between transmitter and receiver. This section describes our main experiments which are fully described in Saunders (1994). First we briey describe GNARL, the algorithm we use to evolve our agents. Then we introduce an extension of the Tracker task <ref> (Jefferson et al., 1992) </ref>, which will serve as a substrate for our experiments. Next, we describe the method of communication our agents employ. <p> GNARL has been applied to several different problems (Angeline, Saunders, and Pollack, 1993). In particular, we have applied GNARL to the Tracker task <ref> (Jefferson et al., 1992) </ref> in which a simulated ant must learn to follow a broken trail of food (Figure 1a). Each ant receives two inputs: one indicating the presence of food in the square directly before the agent; and another detecting the absence of food in that same square.

Reference-contexts: A communication scheme describes the actual signals passed between agents. Language, a collection of sentences drawn from a finite vocabulary, denotes an interpretation of a communication scheme. In this sense, language is a subjective phenomena and is ascribed by an observer <ref> (Kolen and Pollack, 1995) </ref>. For instance, the description agent 0 passes a value of 0.341 to agent 2 down channel 1 reects the implementation of interaction, while the alternative description agent 0 just signalled the presence of food to agent 1 involves the interpretation of interaction.
