Abstract: A multimedia ATM network is shared by media streams with different performance requirements. For media streams such as file transfers, the preservation of bursts and the provision of guarantees for loss probability at the burst level is of primary importance, while, for media streams such as voice, loss guarantees at the cell level are sufficient. Continuous media have stringent delay jitter requirements. Finally, some applications require loss-free transmission. In this paper the first complete traffic management scheme for multimedia ATM networks is introduced supporting a wide variety of quality of service requirements. The operation of the traffic management scheme is completely specified, and real-time admission control algorithms are provided.

Reference-contexts: Losing a number of cells of a burst may result in the loss of the information content of the whole burst. Therefore, an ATM network should support VCs requesting quality of service (QoS) guarantees with respect to the burst-loss probability <ref> [1, 11, 9] </ref>. An ATM network should also support efficiently VCs requiring performance guarantees at the cell level. The estimation of cell-loss probability for networks using statistical multiplexing is one of the most studied problems in the ATM literature [8, 6, 5].

Reference-contexts: Due to space limitations, Type D service is not presented in this paper. The full specification of Q 2 , including the run-time specification and a very fast connection admission control algorithm, can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Cells from Q 2 are serviced whenever there are empty slots in the output frame which are not used by eligible cells from Q 1 . Finally, R l signifies the available link rate. <p> &gt; R l r h i ) = p i p i ) where Z b R l =r h i c = b R l =r h i c1 k=0 p i ) S ( R l (k+1)r i ) The details of this derivation can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Computational Complexity: In order to estimate the complexity of the decision process, the total number of calculations for the evaluation of the QoS of all the sources has to be estimated. <p> The details of the derivation are given in <ref> [4] </ref>. As a example, consider the case of n = 200 VCs requesting service of Type C, and for simplicity assume that all sources have the same peak rate = 1M bps. <p> the total number of calculations for this algorithm is given by: 4 n + 2 ( R l 1) 2 + 52 R l + 8 ( R l 1) + 9 (8) The details of the derivation of the approximate solution and the time complexity can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. approximation on the computation of the cell-loss probability, under the presence of a number of burst scale sources with the same traffic characteristics as the cell-scale sources, and for a variety of peak and mean values.

Moreover it provides preservation of traffic characteristics of a VC which is essential for the purpose of the CAC algorithm. In the framing strategy proposed in [7], the traffic of a particular VC enters a switch at a particular port in and exits the switch from a particular port out. A particular link stream is divided into consecutive and equal frames of duration T , as depicted in Figure 1. <p> There are two potential drawbacks that must be addressed if the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [7] </ref> is to be used in the context of a CAC algorithm. First, the traffic characteristics and QoS requirements of a particular VC must be related to its framing strategy. <p> This second drawback is explained further in Section 3. The first of these problems is the dominant source of inefficiency, but the second can also become important, especially for small frame sizes. In this paper a CAC algorithm is introduced, based on the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>, but enhanced through the successful solution of both of the above mentioned problems. 3 Traffic Characterization in the Pres ence of a Framing Mechanism The traffic characteristics of the traffic stream i are specified by two parameters, the peak rate i and the mean rate i , both in bps.

The burst identification method proposed in <ref> [11] </ref> is used for this purpose. Every cell is marked as the start, middle or end cell of the burst. <p> Every time a cell of Type C arrives, if the counter is less than R l r rsvd ; the cell is accepted; otherwise the arriving cell is rejected. 6 Connection Admission Control 6.1 CAC Algorithm for Type B (Burst scale) Service The algorithm proposed in <ref> [11] </ref> for the computation of the burst loss probability based on the availability of the required buffer slots is also used here. However, rather than focusing on the availability of buffer slots, in this paper the focus is on the availability of the bandwidth required to support the new burst.
