Abstract: In the first part of this book we are going to study how to measure information content; we are going to learn by how much data from a given source can be compressed; we are going to learn how, practically, to achieve data compression; and we are going to learn about how to communicate perfectly over an imperfect communication channel. We start by getting a feeling for this last problem. * an analogue telephone line, over which we communicate digital information using a pair of modems; The last example shows that communication doesn't have to involve information going from one place in space to another. When we write a file on a disk drive, we'll typically read it off again in the same location|but at a later time. All the above channels are noisy. A telephone line usually suffers from cross-talk with other lines, and the hardware in the telephone line distorts and adds noise to the transmitted signal. The deep space network which listens to Galileo's weak transmitter receives background radiation from terrestrial and cosmic sources. And a disk drive, which might write a binary digit (a one or zero, also known as a bit) by aligning a patch of magnetic material in one of two orientations, may later, with some probability, fail to read out the original binary digit that was stored|the patch of material might have spontaneously flipped magnetization, or the reading head might suffer from a glitch of thermal noise that causes the reading circuit to report the wrong value for the binary digit, or maybe the writing head failed to induce the required magnetization in the first place.
