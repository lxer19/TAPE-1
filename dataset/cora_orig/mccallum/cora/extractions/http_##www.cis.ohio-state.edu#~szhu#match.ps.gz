Title: Exploring Texture Ensembles by Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo A conclusion to the Julesz quest?  
Author: Song-Chun Zhu Xiuwen Liu Ying Nian Wu 
Note: Submitted to IEEE Trans. on PAMI, 1999.  
Abstract: This article presents a mathematical definition of texture pattern-the Julesz ensemble, which is the maximum set of images that share identical statistics OE defined on infinity lattice Z 2 . Then texture modeling is posed as an inverse problem: given a set of images sampled from an unknown Julesz ensemble fl , we search for the sufficient and necessary statistics OE fl which define fl . Associated with a Julesz ensemble is a probability distribution q(I; OE) which is uniform over the images in the ensemble and has zero probability outside. It has been proven[35] that q(I; OE) is the limit distribution of the Gibbs distribution (FRAME model or Markov random field) derived by the minimax entropy principle[37]. Therefore, not only the engineering practice of synthesizing textures by matching statistics has been put on a firm mathematical foundation, but also we are released from the burden of learning the expensive FRAME model in feature pursuit, model selection and texture synthesis. The paper also proposed an algorithm for sampling Julesz ensembles by efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo, which generates texture images by moveing along filter coefficients and significantly extends the traditional single site Gibbs sampler. The paper shall also compare four popular statistical measures in the literature, namely, moments, rectified functions, marginal histograms and joint histograms of linear filter responses in terms of their descriptive abilities. We demonstrate that a small number of bins in the marginal histograms are sufficient in capturing a variety of texture patterns, so the full joint histograms appear to be an over-fit. We illustrate our theory and algorithm by successfully synthesizing a large number of natural textures.

Reference-contexts: Thus given observed finite images, the choice of a good model K is an issue of model complexity that has been extensively studied in the statistics literature. In the minimax entropy model [37, 38], an AIC criterion is adopted for model selection <ref> [1] </ref>. The intuitive idea is simple. With observed finite images, we should measure the fluctuation of a new statistics OE (ff) over the sample. Thus when a statistic is added as constraint for the ensemble K , it brings information as well as estimation error.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore as the filter set is often over complete, many different combinations of statistics can produce similar results. Secondly, many texture patterns contain semantic structures presented in a hierarchic organization, as discussed in Marr's primal sketch <ref> [28] </ref>. For example, figure (16) shows three texture patterns: the hair of a woman, the twig of tree, and the zebra stripes. In these texture images, the basic texture elements and their spatial relationships are clearly perceivable. Indeed the perception of these elements plays important role for precise texture segmentation.

Reference-contexts: Is there a general way of designing algorithms for efficient statistics matching? In this paper, we provide answers to problem 1 and 3, while the detailed answer to problem 2 is referred to a companion paper <ref> [35] </ref>. Firstly, we study the mathematical issues in texture modeling and feature pursuit by defining the Julesz ensemble. <p> The Julesz ensemble leads to a mathematical definition of texture on the infinite lattice. In a companion paper <ref> [35] </ref>, Wu and Zhu have proven that the Julesz ensemble is equivalent to the Gibbs ensemble which is the limit of the FRAME model as the image lattice goes to infinity. The ensemble equivalence reveals two significant facts in texture modeling. 1. <p> Thus as fl ! Z 2 , the FRAME model converges to a limiting random field which is a uniform distribution over a typical set which we called the Gibbs ensemble, provided that there is no phase transition. In a companion paper <ref> [35] </ref>, we have proven that the Gibbs ensemble given by p (I; fi) is equivalent to the Julesz ensemble specified by q (I; OE), provided that the same set of observed statistics OE obs is used in both models. <p> Furthermore, pursuit of Julesz ensemble is also governed by the minimax entropy principle [37]. A in-depth discussion is referred to <ref> [35] </ref>. When there is phase transition, there can be more than one limiting random fields for the FRAME model, i.e., if we sample from the FRAME model for different large lattices with different boundary conditions, we will get images of different spatial patterns.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, we propose an effective algorithm for MCMC sampling. In the traditional single site Gibbs sampler <ref> [14, 37] </ref>, the MCMC transition is designed in the following way. For each sweep, a pixel is chosen at random (or with a fixed scan order), and the intensity value of the pixel is updated according to its conditional distribution given neighboring pixels. <p> texture model should be consistent with human texture perception. 8 ... (1) (k) In the literature, Heeger and Bergen made the first attempt to generate textures using marginal histograms [20], and Zhu, Wu, and Mumford studied a new class of Markov random field model that can reproduce the marginal statistics <ref> [37] </ref>. 2 Recently Simoncelli, De Bonet and Viola have argued that joint statistics are needed for synthesizing some texture patterns [9, 4]. <p> This argument is questionable because computationally, the Heeger and Bergen algorithm does not guarantee a close match of statistics, nor is it intended to sample from a texture ensemble. In theory, it is provable that marginal statistics are sufficient for reconstructing the full probability distribution of texture <ref> [37] </ref>, therefore the question is about the efficiency of marginal statistics. We shall discuss the joint statistics in section (7). 3 The Julesz ensemble and MCMC sampling of texture As a second step to answer the Julesz's quest, we should study efficient algorithms for matching statistics and for random sampling. <p> Like fl (), the ensemble K implies a uniform probability distribution q (I; OE) over K , whose entropy is log j K j. W 0W W k In search for the underlying Julesz ensemble fl , one can adopt a pursuit strategy used by (Zhu, Wu, and Mumford <ref> [37] </ref>). When K = 0, we have 0 = fl . <p> In the limit, 1 is equal to obs subject to a translation invariant assumption. Thus given observed finite images, the choice of a good model K is an issue of model complexity that has been extensively studied in the statistics literature. In the minimax entropy model <ref> [37, 38] </ref>, an AIC criterion is adopted for model selection [1]. The intuitive idea is simple. With observed finite images, we should measure the fluctuation of a new statistics OE (ff) over the sample. <p> One general class of MRF model is the minimax entropy model FRAME studied by Zhu, Wu, and Mumford <ref> [36, 37] </ref>. The FRAME model has the Gibbs form, p (I; fi) = Z (fi) P K where the parameters fi = (fi (1) ; fi (2) ; :::; fi (K) ) are the Lagrange multipliers. <p> In the above algorithm q T (I syn (v) j I syn (~v)) is the conditional probability of the pixel value I syn (v) with intensities for the rest of the lattice fixed. We can pursuit the statistics in the above algorithm, as we did in <ref> [37] </ref>. 3.4 About some theoretical issues In this subsection, we briefly discuss some theoretical issues including boundary effects, equivalence of ensembles, and phase transition. In the computation of a feature statistic OE (ff) (I), we need to define boundary conditions so that the filter responses in fl are well defined. <p> Furthermore, pursuit of Julesz ensemble is also governed by the minimax entropy principle <ref> [37] </ref>. A in-depth discussion is referred to [35]. When there is phase transition, there can be more than one limiting random fields for the FRAME model, i.e., if we sample from the FRAME model for different large lattices with different boundary conditions, we will get images of different spatial patterns. <p> See Georgii (1988) for details. 14 4 Experiment: sampling the Julesz ensemble In our first set of experiments, we select all the 56 filters (Gabor filters at various scales and orientations and the small Laplacian of Gaussian filters) as discussed in <ref> [37] </ref>; the largest filter window size is 19 fi 19 pixels. We choose OE to be the marginal histograms of these filters, and we sample the Julesz ensemble using algorithm I. <p> It is almost impractical to learn a FRAME model integrating all these 56 filters in our previous work <ref> [37] </ref>, however the computation is much easier using the simple model q (I). We run the algorithm over a broad set of texture images collected from various sources. The results are displayed in Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. <p> We then proceeded to study statistics simpler than the marginal histograms. In particular, we are interested in knowing how many histogram bins are necessary for texture synthesis, and how the bins are distributed. We adopted the filter pursuit method developed by Zhu, Wu, and Mumford <ref> [37] </ref>. There are totally 56 filters, and each histogram has 11 bins except that the intensity filter has 8 bins. The algorithm selects one bin 22 sampled image using 34 bins from the 605 bins each time according to an information criterion 4 . <p> Because the entropy rate of the Julesz ensemble is the same as that of the FRAME model, d (OE (ff) (b i )) also measures the entropy decrease in the Julesz ensemble. The details about the approximation and the computation of oe 2 ? , is referred to <ref> [37] </ref>. Since d (OE (ff) (b i )) is always positive, this means that the more statistics the more accurate the model is. This is not true when we only have finite observations, because we cannot estimate the observed histograms and variances exactly. <p> Thus the information gain d (OE (ff) (b i )) is balanced by a model complexity term that accounts for the statistical fluctuation, such as the AIC criterion discussed in <ref> [37] </ref>. 4 There is 1 redundant bin for each histogram. 23 Because the second order approximation is good only locally, in the first few pursuit steps, we used the L 1 -norm distance d (OE (ff) (b i )) = jOE (ff) (b i ) OE (ff) obs (b i )j,

With observed finite images, we should measure the fluctuation of a new statistics OE (ff) over the sample. <p> These central bins enforce "smoothness" appearances. The other bins are near the two tails of some large filters, which create image patterns. Such observations seems to confirm the design of Gibbs reaction-diffusion equations <ref> [38] </ref>, where the central bins stand for diffusion effects and the tail bins are for reaction effects. 6 Designing efficient MCMC samplers.
