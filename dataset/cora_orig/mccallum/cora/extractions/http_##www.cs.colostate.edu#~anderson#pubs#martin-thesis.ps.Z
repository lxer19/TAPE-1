Reference-contexts: For scenes in which the number of patches is relatively small, Gauss-Seidel relaxation can be used. For scenes with a large number of patches, hybrids of Southwell and Jacobi iteration (progressive radiosity) are frequently used. (See chapter 5 in <ref> [Cohen 93] </ref>.) 2.6 The Hemicube Approximation Given that there is no closed form solution to Equation 2.5, some form of approxima tion has to be made to compute form factors. The hemicube is one of the most popular approximation method used in radiosity form factor computation.

Reference-contexts: The final solution has eighteen constants of integration. If nothing else, the complexity of the solution is a testament to the difficulty of solving the form factor integral. 2.8 Training the Neural Networks with Cross Validation The neural networks were trained using backpropagation with cross validation <ref> [Hass 95, page 226] </ref>. Using cross validation makes the training more resistant to over fitting of the training data. Roughly 80% of the training data was used to train the neural network, 10% was used as a validation set and 10% was used as a test set.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 4 EXPERIMENTS WITH DATA FROM A SIMPLE SCENE 4.1 Overview In order to do both visual and numerical comparisons of the accuracy of environments rendered with neural networks, a public domain radiosity package, Rad <ref> [Patt 92] </ref>, was modified to compute form factors with both the analytic solution described above and with neural networks in addition to the hemicube method already implemented in Rad. <p> The rest of this chapter describes the methods used to modify Rad, train the neural networks, perform the statistical tests. The results are presented statistically and as a rendered scene. 4.2 The Method 4.2.1 Modifying Rad Rad is a public domain radiosity rendering program written by S. N. Pattanaik <ref> [Patt 92] </ref>. As delivered, Rad computes form factor values using the hemicube method so the program was modified to also compute form factors with the analytic library and neural networks. The algorithm used for these modifications is shown in Figure 4.1.

Reference-contexts: Since no general closed form solution to equation 1.1 above exists, the reduced problem of calculating form factors for planar quadrilaterals will be considered. Schroder and Hanrahan <ref> [Schro 93] </ref> have published a closed form solution for form factor calculation for general polygons and have made a C library available for its computation. This solution will be used to train and test the accuracy of the neural network approximation. <p> Because the hemicube is so widely used in rendering radiosity images, it makes an excellent benchmark for the usability of other form factor calculation methods and was used to measure the usefulness of the neural network approximation. 2.7 An Analytic Solution In 1993 Schroder and Hanrahan <ref> [Schro 93] </ref> published a closed form solution for the computation of form factors between two general (planar, convex or concave, perhaps containing holes) polygons. They made a C library implementation available over the internet from Princeton University.

They made a C library implementation available over the internet from Princeton University. (See reference [Schro 93]). The library functions calculate the form factor between two polygons which are specified by lists of the x; y; and z values of each vertex in each polygon.

Reference-contexts: The relative complexity of these approximation schemes will be compared. More complete and general treatments of radiosity are given in heat transfer texts such as [Sparr 78]. We use the notation used in Sillion's book <ref> [Sill 94] </ref> and use the development in pages 9-13 and 23-31. 2.2 Definition of Radiosity Radiance, L, is defined as the amount of energy traveling at some point in a specified direction per unit time, per unit area perpendicular to the direction of travel. (See L (x; ; ) dx cos <p> For two points x and y, which are mutually visible L (x; x ; x ) = L (y; y ; y ): 5 (From <ref> [Sill 94, page 9] </ref>). <p> Hence, L (x; ; ) = L (x): We next seek to consider the distribution of energy from the point of view of a point on a surface. Energy radiating from the point can be considered to be the sum of two 6 (From <ref> [Sill 94, page 29] </ref>.) sources. If a point is an emitter then it radiates light into the environment as a source. The point can also gather radiation from the environment and re-radiate it into the scene through diffuse reflectance. <p> Using the properties of ideal diffuse reflectors and the reciprocity property of radiance mentioned above, it can be shown <ref> [Sill 94, pg. 26] </ref> that H (x) = y2S cos cos r 2 V (x; y)dy; where S is the surface of integration, and 0 are defined in Figure 2.2 and V (x; y) = 1; if x and y are mutually visible; 0; otherwise. 7 Thus our energy balance equation <p> Since d! r 2 ; the top faces of the hemicube (of unit height) have delta form factor values F = (1 + x 2 + y 2 ) 2 (2.7) 10 (From <ref> [Sill 94, page 49] </ref>.) 11 (From [Sill 94, page 51].)
