Abstract: Technical Summary Report # 97-04 March 1997 ABSTRACT Refinable functions underlie the theory and constructions of wavelet systems on the one hand, and the theory and convergence analysis of uniform subdivision algorithms. The regularity of such functions dictates, in the context of wavelets, the smoothness of the derived wavelet system, and, in the subdivision context, the smoothness of the limiting surface of the iterative process. Since the refinable function is, in many circumstances, not known analytically, the analysis of its regularity must be based on the explicitly known mask. We establish in this paper a formula that computes, for isotropic dilation and in any number of variables, the sharp L 2 -regularity of the refinable function in terms of the spectral radius of the restriction of the associated transfer operator to a specific invariant subspace H of it. For a compactly supported refinable function , the relevant invariant space is proved to be finite dimensional, and is completely characterized in terms of the dependence relations among the shifts of together with the polynomials that these shifts reproduce. The previously known formula for this compact support case requires the further assumptions that the mask is finitely supported, and that the shifts of are stable. Adopting a stability assumption (but without assuming the finiteness of the mask), we derive that known formula from our general one. Moreover, we show that in the absence of stability, the lower bound provided by that previously known formula may be abysmal. Our characterization is further extended to the FSI (i.e., vector) case, to the unisotropic dilation matrix case, and to even more general setups. We also establish corresponding results for refinable distributions.

Reference-contexts: From that one easily concludes that, denoting by m the refinement mask of , we have a relation of the form m = t for some polynomial t (which is the Fourier transform of the measure 1 ). This approach, indeed, was already put into good use in <ref> [R2] </ref>, in the analysis of the stability and linear independence properties of univariate refinable functions. <p> The last section of <ref> [R2] </ref> contains an algorithm that, based on the factorization of m into linear factors, finds the mask m 2 m 3 (from which the extraction of m 3 is immediate). 3.

Since ` ff () &lt; 1, and since we also assume that b (0) 6= 0, we conclude (cf. <ref> [R3] </ref>, [J2]) that the shifts of provide approximation order `, and standard approximation theory techniques can then be used to show that contains all polynomials of degree &lt; 2`, hence that all functions in I (including the above f ) has a zero of order 2` at the origin.
