Abstract: In this paper, a new design style for multi-FPGA system is proposed. It fills the large gap between high-level synthesis and the FPGA logic design by providing datapath circuit module library which can contain high-level simulation models as well as low-level circuit netlists. Some bit-serial circuit modules have been designed which are easy to partition and place within multiple FPGAs. Also, we have describe our novel work on Field-Programmable Multi-Chip Module which demonstrates its ability in reducing hardware size, reducing power consumption, reducing packaging cost and providing with high density chip-to-chip connections.

Reference-contexts: Researches on this FPGA-based custom computing have been active on both aspects [1][2]<ref> [3] </ref>, however, often failing to merge the two together. Engineers can implement an efficient, high-performance design on this FPGA-based system with a design methodology similar to custom chip design requiring extensive knowledge of digital system and experience [3]. On the other hand, efforts in making the FPGA-based systems easy to program has come to a point where designers can write VHDL-like programs and the tools will automatically generate the FPGA configuration data [4][5].

Reference-contexts: Simply attaching a high-level synthesis tool which translates high-level behavioral description like C and PASCAL into structural description would result in poor implementation since the decisions made in the high-level synthesis can only be based upon some unreliable information about the hardware size and performance of the datapath components <ref> [6] </ref>. 5. Each design iteration takes too long. A time to compile a structural description into configuration data takes tens of minutes, possibly hours. This also discourages the users.

Reference-contexts: The power and ground plane form a good decoupling capacitance. If necessary, additional processing steps can be added to produce intergrated floating capacitors, thin-film resistors, inductors, and bipolar transistors. The most promising assembly technique for MCM is the flip-chip attachment <ref> [7] </ref>. In flip-chip, dice are attached with pads facing down via solder bumps which form the mechanical and electrical connections. The flip-chip technology provides area pads through solder bumps which are distributed over the entire chip surface, rather than being confined to the periphery as in conventional packaging.

Reference-contexts: AT&T Bell Laboratory has designed a set of low voltage, high-speed IO buffers optimized specifically for MCM. The results show that these new buffers reduce power consumption 6fi and increase performance 2:5fi compared to conventional CMOS buffers and they can operate at up to 400MHz <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 FPMCM Design Environment 3.1 Problems of Current FPGA Design Environment The existing FPGA design tools are provided with the thought that the FPGA users are engineers with experience and patience. And they are specially tuned to implement random logics efficiently as possible.

Reference-contexts: The process has also been carefully optimized to minimize cost without sacrificing the performance of digital circuits. 2.2 FPMCM-I Architecture We have designed and are in the process of manufacturing a first generation FPMCM (FPMCM-I) <ref> [9] </ref>. The purpose of the first generation device is to fully exercise the MCM fabrication and assembly technology, quickly familiarize ourselves with the technical problems of FPMCM design, uncover any pitfalls, and try out an initial architecture. Fig. 1. Physical Design First Generation FPMCM. <p> To summarize, the FPMCM-I has 268 user IO in addition to numerous power, ground and control signals <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.3 Advantages of MCM MCMs have many advantages over traditional packaging: lower electrical para-sitics between packages, smaller size, increased interconnect resources, and reduced packaging cost. 1. Power consumption reduction: All other things being equal, the lower capacitive loads of shorter MCM interconnect provide substantial power savings.
