Abstract: Our concepts of biology, evolution and complexity are constrained by having observed only a single instance of life, life on Earth. A truly comparative biology is needed to extend these concepts. Because we can not observe life on other planets, we are left with the alternative of creating artificial life forms on Earth. I will discuss the approach of inoculating evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium, it is a logical/informational medium. Thus these new instances of evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic evolution (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics), and therefore exist in what amounts to another universe, governed by the "physical laws" of the logic of the computer. This exercise gives us a broader perspective on what evolution is and what it does. An evolutionary approach to synthetic biology consists of inoculating the process of evolution by natural selection into an artificial medium. Evolution is then allowed to find the natural forms of living organisms in the artificial medium. These are not models of life, but independent instances of life. This essay is intended to communicate a way of thinking about synthetic biology that leads to a particular approach: to understand and respect the natural form of the artificial medium, to facilitate the process of evolution in generating forms that are adapted to the medium, and to let evolution find forms and processes that naturally exploit the possibilities inherent in the medium. Examples are cited of synthetic biology embedded in the computational medium, where in addition to being an exercise in experimental comparative evolutionary biology, it is also a possible means of harnessing the evolutionary process for the production of complex computer software.

Reference-contexts: Some experiments have already been done with using artificial selection to guide the evolution of digital organisms for the performance of "useful" tasks <ref> [1, 89, 91] </ref>. I envision two approaches to the management of digital evolution: digital husbandry, and digital genetic engineering. Digital husbandry is an analogy to animal husbandry. This technique would be used for the evolution of the most advanced and complex software, with intelligent capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Imagine however, the problems that could arise if evolving digital organisms were to colonize the computers connected to the major networks. They could spread across the network like the infamous internet worm <ref> [2, 8, 83, 84] </ref>. When we attempted to stop them, they could evolve mechanisms to escape from our attacks. It might conceivably be very difficult to eliminate them. However, this scenario is highly unlikely, as it is probably not possible for digital organisms to evolve on normal computer systems.

Reference-contexts: A typical instantiation of this type involves the introduction of a self-replicating machine language program into the RAM memory of a computer subject to random errors such as bit flips in the memory or occasionally inaccurate calculations <ref> [3, 7, 20, 53, 71] </ref>. This generates the basic conditions for evolution by natural selection as outlined by Darwin [14]: self-replication in a finite environment with heritable genetic variation. In this instantiation, the self-replicating machine language program is thought of as the individual "digital organism" or "creature". <p> When memory is full, the reaper frees memory to make space for new creatures by killing off the top of the queue. However, each time an individual generates an error condition, it moves up the reaper queue one position. An interesting variation on this was introduced by Barton-Davis <ref> [3] </ref> who eliminated the reaper queue. In its place, he caused the "flaw rate" (see section on Flaws above) to increase with the age of the individual, in mimicry of wear and tear. When the flaw rate reached 100%, the individual was killed. <p> Many of the serious efforts to extend the Tierra model have included as a central feature, the creation of a two-dimensional space for the creatures to inhabit <ref> [3, 15, 16, 53, 81] </ref>. The logic behind the motivation derives from contemplation of the extent to which the dimensionality of the space we live in permits the richness of pattern and process that we observe in nature.

Reference-contexts: At the present, there are no self-replicating artificial organisms implemented in either hardware or wetware (with the exception of some simple organic molecules with evidently small and finite evolutionary potential [25, 36, 66]). However, there are active attempts to synthesize RNA molecules capable of replication <ref> [4, 42] </ref>, and there is much discussion of the future possibility of self-replicating nano-technology and macro-robots. I would strongly urge that as any of these technologies approaches the point where self-replication is possible, the work be moved to specialized containment facilities.

Reference-contexts: Very elaborate behavioral and molecular mechanisms are required to orchestrate this joint contribution of genetic material to the offspring. The preponderance of sex remains an enigma to evolutionary theory <ref> [5, 26, 31, 32, 55, 61, 86, 96] </ref>. Careful analysis has failed to show any benefits from sex, at the level of the individual organism, that outweigh the high costs (e.g., passing on only half of the genome).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the machine language defined by the CPU constitutes the genetic language of the digital organism. It is worth noting at this point that the organic organism most comparable to this kind of digital organism is the hypothetical, and now extinct, RNA organism <ref> [6] </ref>. These were presumably nothing more than RNA molecules capable of catalyzing their own replication. What the supposed RNA organisms have in common with the simple digital organism is that a single molecule constitutes the body and the genetic information, and effects the replication.

Reference-contexts: It is argued that this transition from organic to metallic based life is the inevitable and natural next step in evolution. The naturalness of this step is argued by analogy with the supposed genetic takeovers in which nucleic acids became the genetic material taking over from clays <ref> [10] </ref>, and cultural evolution took over from DNA based genetic evolution in modern humans. I would point out that whatever nucleic acids took over from, it marked the origin of life more than the passing of a torch.

Reference-contexts: This hypothesis suggests that in the face of a changing environment, organisms must evolve as fast as they can in order to simply maintain their current state of adaptation. "In order to get anywhere you must run twice as fast as that" <ref> [11] </ref>. If organisms only had to adapt to the non-living environment, the race would not be so urgent. Species would only need to evolve as fast as the relatively gradual changes in the geology and climate.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested that much of this junk code is the result of the self-replication of pieces of DNA within rather than between cells [21, 67]. Mobile genetic elements, transposons, have this intra-genome self-replicating property. It has been estimated that 80% of spontaneous mutations are caused by transposons <ref> [12, 30] </ref>. Repeated sequences, resulting from the activity of mobile elements, range from dozens to millions in numbers of copies, and from hundreds to tens of thousands of base pairs in length. They vary widely in dispersion patterns from clumped to sparse [41].

Reference-contexts: However, quantitative analysis has shown that in order for sex to be favored by selection at the individual level, it is not enough for the environment to change unpredictably, the environment must actually change capriciously <ref> [13, 57] </ref>. That is, whatever genotype has the highest fitness this generation, must have the lowest fitness the next generation, or at least a trend in this direction, a negative heritability of fitness.

Reference-contexts: The evolutionary objective then became to have a suicide instruction in your genome which you do not execute yourself, but which you try to get other individuals to execute. Litherland [51] introduced death by local crowding. Davidge caused processes to die when they contained certain values in their registers <ref> [16] </ref>. Gray [29] allowed each process six attempts at reproduction, after which they would die. 16 9 Operating System Much of the "physics and chemistry" of the digital universe is determined by the specifications of the operations performed by the instruction set of the CPU. <p> Many of the serious efforts to extend the Tierra model have included as a central feature, the creation of a two-dimensional space for the creatures to inhabit <ref> [3, 15, 16, 53, 81] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In many cases transposons carry a sequence that acts as a promoter, altering the regulation of genes at the site of insertion [90]. Transposons may produce gene products and often are involved in gene regulation <ref> [17] </ref>. However, they may have no effect on the external phenotype of the individual [21]. Therefore they evolve through another paradigm of selection, one that does not involve an external phenotype.

In these systems, a collection of simulated "neurons" are created, and connected so that they can pass messages. The learning that takes place is accomplished by adjusting the "weights" of the connections.

The second approach to software synthesis is what I have called instantiation rather than simulation.

Eigen limited his discussion to species of viruses, where it is also easy to think of sequence spaces.

Reference-contexts: The use of machine code as a genetic system raises the problem of brittleness. It has generally been assumed by computer scientists that machine language programs can not be evolved because random alterations such as bit flips and recombinations will always produce inviable programs. It has been suggested <ref> [23] </ref> that overcoming this brittleness and "Discovering how to make such self-replicating patterns more robust so that they evolve to increasingly more complex states is probably the central problem in the study of artificial life." The assumption that machine languages are too brittle to evolve is probably true, as a consequence

It was the process initiated at this time that led to the evolution of immune systems, nervous systems, physiological systems, developmental systems, complex morphology, and complex ecosystems.

Reference-contexts: Somehow the principle of competitive exclusion is circumvented. There are many theories on how competitive exclusion may be circumvented. One leading theory is that periodic disturbance at the proper level sets back the process of competitive exclusion, allowing more species to coexist <ref> [37, 38, 39] </ref>. There is substantial evidence that moderate levels of disturbance can increase diversity. In a digital community, disturbance might take the form of freeing blocks of memory that had been filled with digital organisms.

Reference-contexts: Several very good examples of bottom up ecological models have appeared in the AL literature [34, 92]. However, ecologists have also developed this same approach independently of the AL movement, and have called the approach "individual based" models <ref> [19, 40] </ref>. The second approach to software synthesis is what I have called instantiation rather than simulation. In simulation, data structures are created which contain variables that represent the states of the entities being modeled.

Reference-contexts: Repeated sequences, resulting from the activity of mobile elements, range from dozens to millions in numbers of copies, and from hundreds to tens of thousands of base pairs in length. They vary widely in dispersion patterns from clumped to sparse <ref> [41] </ref>. Larger transposons carry one or more genes in addition to those necessary for transposition. Transposons may grow to include more genes; one mechanism involves the placement of two transposons into close proximity so that they act as a single large transposon incorporating the intervening code. <p> In this manner, "smart" genetic operators may have evolved, through the interaction of selection acting at two or more hierarchical levels (it appears that some transposons have followed another evolutionary route, developing inter-cellular mobility and becoming viruses 15 <ref> [41] </ref>). It is likely that transposons today represent the full continuum from purely parasitic "selfish DNA" and viruses to highly coevolved genetic operators and gene regulators.

Reference-contexts: At the present, there are no self-replicating artificial organisms implemented in either hardware or wetware (with the exception of some simple organic molecules with evidently small and finite evolutionary potential [25, 36, 66]).

I would strongly urge that as any of these technologies approaches the point where self-replication is possible, the work be moved to specialized containment facilities.

The fields of genetic algorithms [27, 35], and genetic programming <ref> [47] </ref> are based on controlling the evolution of computer programs. However, we still have very little experience with controlling the evolution of self-replicating computer programs, which is more difficult. In addition, breeding complex parallel programs is likely to bring new challenges.

Reference-contexts: With more species of algae, herbivores may begin to specialize on different species of algae, enhancing diversification in herbivores.

It has been demonstrated that in a wide variety of contexts, the number of species occupying an "area" increases with the area. The number of species increases in proportion to the area raised to a power between 0.1 and 0.3.

This generates the basic conditions for evolution by natural selection as outlined by Darwin [14]: self-replication in a finite environment with heritable genetic variation.

This is a one way transferral of genetic material, rather than a reciprocal exchange.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested that much of this junk code is the result of the self-replication of pieces of DNA within rather than between cells <ref> [21, 67] </ref>. Mobile genetic elements, transposons, have this intra-genome self-replicating property. It has been estimated that 80% of spontaneous mutations are caused by transposons [12, 30]. <p> However, they may have no effect on the external phenotype of the individual [21]. Therefore they evolve through another paradigm of selection, one that does not involve an external phenotype. They are seen as a mechanism for the selfish spread of DNA which may become inactive junk after mutation <ref> [67] </ref>. DNA of transposon origin can be recognized by their palindrome endings flanked by short non-reversed repeated sequences resulting from insertion after staggered cuts. In Drosophila melanogaster approximately 5 to 10 percent of its total DNA is composed of sequences bearing these signs.

Reference-contexts: The sentient properties of plants are so radically different from those of animals, that they are generally unrecognized or denied by humans, and plants are merely in another kingdom of the one great tree of organic life on earth <ref> [70, 75, 88] </ref>. Synthetic organisms evolving in other media such as the digital computer, are not only not a part of the same phylogeny, but they are not even of the same physics.

Reference-contexts: Some experiments have already been done with using artificial selection to guide the evolution of digital organisms for the performance of "useful" tasks <ref> [1, 89, 91] </ref>. I envision two approaches to the management of digital evolution: digital husbandry, and digital genetic engineering. Digital husbandry is an analogy to animal husbandry. This technique would be used for the evolution of the most advanced and complex software, with intelligent capabilities.

Reference-contexts: In many cases transposons carry a sequence that acts as a promoter, altering the regulation of genes at the site of insertion <ref> [90] </ref>. Transposons may produce gene products and often are involved in gene regulation [17]. However, they may have no effect on the external phenotype of the individual [21]. Therefore they evolve through another paradigm of selection, one that does not involve an external phenotype. <p> It has been stated that: "transposable elements can induce mutations that result in complex and intricately regulated changes in a single step", and they are "A highly evolved macromutational mechanism" <ref> [90] </ref>. In this manner, "smart" genetic operators may have evolved, through the interaction of selection acting at two or more hierarchical levels (it appears that some transposons have followed another evolutionary route, developing inter-cellular mobility and becoming viruses 15 [41]).

Reference-contexts: The sexual process is implemented with the "cross-over" genetic operator in the field of genetic algorithms, where it has been considered to be the most important genetic operator [35]. The cross-over operator has also been implemented in synthetic life systems <ref> [76, 91] </ref>. However, it has been implemented in the spirit of a genetic algorithm, rather than in the spirit of synthetic life. This is because in these implementations the cross-over process is not under the control of the organism, but rather is forced on the individual. <p> Some experiments have already been done with using artificial selection to guide the evolution of digital organisms for the performance of "useful" tasks <ref> [1, 89, 91] </ref>. I envision two approaches to the management of digital evolution: digital husbandry, and digital genetic engineering. Digital husbandry is an analogy to animal husbandry.

Reference-contexts: As the simulation runs, populations of these data structures interact according to local rules, and the global behavior of the system emerges from those interactions. Several very good examples of bottom up ecological models have appeared in the AL literature <ref> [34, 92] </ref>. However, ecologists have also developed this same approach independently of the AL movement, and have called the approach "individual based" models [19, 40]. The second approach to software synthesis is what I have called instantiation rather than simulation.

Reference-contexts: It has been estimated that typically 98% of the DNA in eukaryotes is neither translated into proteins nor involved in gene regulation, that it is simply "junk" DNA <ref> [93] </ref>. It has been suggested that much of this junk code is the result of the self-replication of pieces of DNA within rather than between cells [21, 67]. Mobile genetic elements, transposons, have this intra-genome self-replicating property.

Reference-contexts: In synthetic life systems implemented in computers, death is not likely to be a process that would occur spontaneously, and it must generally be introduced artificially by the designer. Everyone who has set up such a system has found their own unique solutions. Todd <ref> [94] </ref> recently discussed this problem in general terms. In the Tierra system [71] death is handled by a "reaper" function of the operating system. The reaper uses a linear queue. When creatures are born, they enter the bottom of the queue.

Reference-contexts: This coupled evolutionary race can lead to increasingly complex nervous systems in the evolving predator and prey species. This mutual evolutionary dynamic is related to the Red Queen hypothesis <ref> [95] </ref>, named after the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland.

Reference-contexts: Very elaborate behavioral and molecular mechanisms are required to orchestrate this joint contribution of genetic material to the offspring. The preponderance of sex remains an enigma to evolutionary theory <ref> [5, 26, 31, 32, 55, 61, 86, 96] </ref>. Careful analysis has failed to show any benefits from sex, at the level of the individual organism, that outweigh the high costs (e.g., passing on only half of the genome).
