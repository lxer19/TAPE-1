Reference-contexts: Our observation seems to indicate that the lack of moderator action may be caused by the over-active role of the presenter as discussed next. In fact, this observation is in agreement with the experiment conducted by <ref> [Brothers et al., 1990] </ref>, in which they observe that the moderator tends to loose influence to the Reader and Scribe. Both reader and scribe roles are assumed by the Presenter in our experiment.

Reference-contexts: In the following sections, we will present the results of review effectiveness and review cost analysis. The analysis will follow the formulation of Latin Square Design <ref> [Montgomery, 1984] </ref>. 1.2.1 Review effectiveness Review effectiveness is measured by the number of faults detected by the groups.
