Abstract: We present a strategy for sharing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) information in a wireless, two-way automatic communications environment such as digital cellular and personal communications services (networks). It is assumed that communications can be initiated by the mobile or the service, with or without user intervention. Based on the demand of information, the availability of data channels, the server can dynamically move the clients from channel to channel in order to achieve better use of both network resources and information.

With the recent dramatic increase in mobile computing power and the (r-)evolution in wireless communications, mobile computing and communications devices/equipment are becoming more powerful and intelligent.

Reference-contexts: The problem of comparatively higher cost of cellular and PCS is deminishing as their price continues to decrease. In <ref> [7] </ref>, we presented a medium access control protocol for shared channels in such environments. We, in this paper, focus on how to manage information sharing among various service providers, the communications network, and the users. <p> Over-crowdedness is a condition determined by the information server. It can be characterized by excessive portion of corrupted messages from the reverse channel, even when a MAC protocol such as MUF <ref> [7] </ref> is being used. Once the server decides that an over-crowdedness has occurred, it asks the cellular network to migrate some arbitrarily-chosen users into a new channel, if such a channel is available.
