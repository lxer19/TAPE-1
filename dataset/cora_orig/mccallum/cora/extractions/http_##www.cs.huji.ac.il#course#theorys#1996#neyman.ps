Reference-contexts: There are two alternatives to define strategies with bounded recall. The first one (see e.g. Aumann and Sorin, 1989) considers strategies with bounded recall 17 which choose an action as a function of the recalled opponents' actions, and the second alternative <ref> (see e.g. Kalai and Stanford, 1988, or Lehrer 1988) </ref> allows a player to rely on his opponents' actions as well as on his own. The following are results on repeated games with bounded recall of the second type which are closely related to those presented for finite automata.

Reference-contexts: The difficulties in the study of equilibrium payoffs of n-person infinitely repeated games is the asymptotics of the minmax payoffs which is unknown. As for 2-player finitely repeated games with either 23 mixed action or probabilistic transition automata, it seems that our con-structed equilibrium <ref> (Neyman 1995) </ref> in the finitely repeated games, remains an equilibrium in the game in which players are restricted to play with either mixed action or probabilistic automata with the same bounds.
