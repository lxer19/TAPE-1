Title: Personal Mobility for Multimedia Services in the Internet  
Author: Henning Schulzrinne 
Address: Fokus  
Affiliation: GMD  
Abstract: Personal mobility is one of the goals of Universal Personal Telecommunications (UPT) being specified for future deployment. Most current efforts focus on telephony, with SS7 signaling. However, many of the same goals can be accomplished for multimedia services, by using existing Internet protocols. We describe a multimedia call/conference setup protocol that provides personal videophone addresses, independent of the workstation a called party might be using at the time. The system is set up to use the existing Internet email address as a videophone address. Location and call handling information is kept at the subscriber's home site for improved access and privacy.

Reference-contexts: H.320 conferences use multipoint control units (MCUs) for multiparticipant conferences and tend to scale badly with increasing numbers of conference participants. IP multicast has been used experimentally in the Internet for both interactive conferencing and audio/video distribution <ref> [1, 2] </ref> for groups up to several hundred participants. For the MBONE, conferences and seminars are typically announced worldwide or regionally through a multicast session directory. While IP multicast scales nicely to large groups, a multicast session directory is not suitable for thousands of concurrent phone calls or small-group conferences.

Reference-contexts: Generally, all Internet-based conferencing tools lack an easy-to-use mechanism to call up other users or invite them to a conference. That functionality is the subject of this paper. We also intend to show that much of the control functionality envisioned for intelligent networks <ref> [3] </ref> can be supplied by simple extensions of existing Internet services, running on workstations and personal computers. We describe a multimedia call control agent that offers flexible support for mobility and call processing.

Reference-contexts: Mobile IP efforts [4] provide the ability to move during a call without losing packet-level connectivity. Also, IP multicast <ref> [5] </ref> can be used to ensure continuous packet-level connectivity in a multimedia conference as long as the end system can listen and transmit in two cells simultaneously, so that it can join the multicast group in the new cell while still receiving data packets from the old cell.

Reference-contexts: Personal mobility is based on the use of a unique personal identity (i.e., 'personal number'). <ref> [6, p. 44] </ref>. The issue of naming will be discussed in detail in Section 2.1. Terminal and personal mobility are two aspects of the intelligent network envisioned by telecommunication network operators (PNOs). Some current services such as 800-numbers (free phone) and call forwarding are viewed as first-generation intelligent network services. <p> Some current services such as 800-numbers (free phone) and call forwarding are viewed as first-generation intelligent network services. Recently, the moniker Universal Personal Telecommunication (UPT) has been used to describe the ability to enable communication with a person at any time, at any place, and in any form <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. The work described here provides a form of personal mobility. The call mechanism assigns each subscriber a permanent address naming a home base that manages call handling and forwarding to the terminal the callee is currently using. That terminal may be wired or wireless.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the Internet has had a fairly usable naming mechanism for many years, in the form of the domain name system <ref> [8, p. 650ff] </ref>. Here, individual Internet hosts are designated by a hierarchical domain name, e.g., ursa.fokus.gmd.de. For electronic mail, RFC 821 specifies the familiar @ notation, with the form name@host or name@domain.

Reference-contexts: Location servers can be either centralized, with the attendant increased failure probability and load concentration problems, or distributed. Location servers can use active badges <ref> [9] </ref>, or more traditional Unix services such as rwho, rusers or finger. (Unfortunately, rusers and rwho use data link layer broadcasts and are thus usually disabled.) User location can be on-demand, polled or event-driven plus a combination of these. <p> If not, the location daemon is queried for the current location and the call forwarded to that host. If the user is not logged in anywhere, the call is rejected with an appropriate status code. If active badges <ref> [9] </ref> are in use, the call might be forwarded to a console located in the office visited by the badge owner. (This has not been implemented yet.) Based on the media listed first in the Accept or Required headers, the conference controller maps the media and parameters to a media agent

Reference-contexts: However, it is possible to use a different address, using the same format. We will generically refer to the name@host-style address for multimedia conversations as the videophone address.

The requests begin with a one-line command, as described below.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, the basic protocol could be implemented in a binary encoding, such as ASN.1, but request rates are expected to be low enough that the advantages of easy generation and parsing by programs such as Tcl <ref> [14] </ref> and humans outweigh efficiency costs. 3.1 Call Setup Two-party calls and invitations to multicast conferences proceed in the same manner. During a multicast conference, additional conferees can be invited by any participant with the same mechanism. The call proceeds in two stages.

Reference-contexts: The sequence of lookups is designed to work even when only a few systems implement the MUCS protocol and makes maximum use of the email infrastructure for obtaining current location information. DNS address (A) records map a host name to one or more Internet addresses, while mail-exchange (MX) records <ref> [15] </ref>, as mentioned, map a domain name to the host name of its mail exchange host. Rather than using MX records and thus forcing MUCS servers to be co-located with mail exchangers, a new service (SRV) resource record [16] can be used, once it is implemented more widely.

Reference-contexts: Rather than using MX records and thus forcing MUCS servers to be co-located with mail exchangers, a new service (SRV) resource record <ref> [16] </ref> can be used, once it is implemented more widely. However, using the mail host as a MUCS server has practical advantages. Due to the importance of electronic mail, it is likely to be well cared for and reliable.

Reference-contexts: The MUCS protocol currently uses TCP to a MUCS-specific well-known port to reliably exchange requests and replies. Handshake delays can be reduced by transactional TCP <ref> [17] </ref>. It could be argued that the call setup protocol should contact callees via IP multicast. However, this implies the need for a reliable multicast protocol, an effort probably not worthwhile given the typically low number of targets.

Reference-contexts: If the callee does not support at least one of the media listed in a Required header, it returns None available and the call fails. Media descriptions uses the MIME grammar. The SDP <ref> [18] </ref> format could have been used instead, but appears more cumbersome and breaks with Internet header conventions.

Reference-contexts: The SDP [18] format could have been used instead, but appears more cumbersome and breaks with Internet header conventions. Each media entry lists the type (audio, video, application, ... ), the encoding and a list of parameter/value pairs, including the port number, the transport protocol, the RTP payload type <ref> [19] </ref>, any floor control properties and the bit rate to be reserved. In the example, the caller is only interested in a call if the callee can communicate in one of the three audio formats listed, with PCMU (-law PCM), one channel, 16000 Hz sampling rate, preferred. <p> When the conference initiator invites participants, complete membership information is not available, and thus cannot be distributed. For multicast media distribution, it appears best to distribute membership information periodically via multicast, using RTCP <ref> [19] </ref> for real-time media. Maintaining membership information for conferences run over a web of unicast connections or per-site point-to-multipoint connections, say, in ATM or ST-II, is cumbersome without a central conference registry or a distinguished conference initiator. <p> IDMS'96 (European Workshop on Interactive Distributed Multimedia Systems and Services), Berlin, Ger-many, March 4-6, 1996 11 3.6 Interaction with Other Signaling Protocols The MUCS protocol has to interact with a number of other signaling protocols in the Internet. Audio and video applications may use RTP <ref> [19] </ref> and its associated signaling protocol, RTCP.

Reference-contexts: The protocol only implements a one-round negotiation for media types. If more complicated negotiations, including voting, with several participants are required, a more sophisticated protocol such as the agreement protocol <ref> [20] </ref> must be used. However, it seems likely that most applications will support a range of encodings, with large common subsets, so that elaborate negotiations may not be necessary.

Reference-contexts: Applications are free to switch encodings during the call to any one of those accepted, for example to adapt to changing network congestion conditions or quality requirements <ref> [21] </ref>. We assume that applications can receive different media types concurrently and that the media type sent does not have to equal the media type received. This is generally true for today's MBONE applications, with the exception of different audio sampling rates, but may not be true for hardware devices.

Reference-contexts: The client can then decide which, if any, of the locations to contact. The client is also responsible for detecting forwarding loops. The redirect mode is similar in philosophy to the whois++ <ref> [22] </ref> directory traversal mode. The two modes can be freely mixed within a call. Note that, after locating a MUCS server, the protocol makes no distinction between mail server hosts and reqular hosts.

Reference-contexts: Both of these are undesirable, as they make it difficult to continue conferences after the initiator has left or the central registry is no longer reachable. Another approach to maintaining a membership list has been explored by the Sticky conference control protocol <ref> [23] </ref>, where transitive closure of reachability is passed around. This approach is also usable here. If the initiator has contacted the initial set of members, it can then issue a change request to all members, containing To fields for all.

Reference-contexts: Only the request line has to remain unencrypted. PGP keys are also email addresses, so that the re-use of these addresses by MUCS yields another benefit. Other security mechanisms like the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) <ref> [24] </ref> or IP-level authentication or encryption could be used. If the CALL request is encrypted, in can also be used to transfer a media session key (the Key header in Fig. 2).

Reference-contexts: However, given MUCS's use of point-to-point TCP connections, RTCP is a better match for multicast conferences. The MUCS protocol does not reserve network resources. It is expected that individual applications, when opening network sockets, will also issue resource reservation requests, usually through the resource reservation protocol (RSVP) <ref> [25] </ref>. For most audio encodings, the necessary information for bandwidth reservation is implied by the media type, for video and other sources, the media description contains the desired bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: If a call arrives, a user-specified Tcl script is executed in a safe environment, allowing automatic forwarding of calls, similar in spirit to the ideas presented in <ref> [26] </ref> for interfacing with a traditional telephone or the scripts used for forwarding and filtering electronic mail. If the script has not disposed of the call by forwarding or rejecting it, the conference daemon tries to determine if the called party is logged on the local console.

Reference-contexts: If CHANGE requests come in, the conference controller IDMS'96 (European Workshop on Interactive Distributed Multimedia Systems and Services), Berlin, Ger-many, March 4-6, 1996 12 uses the local multicast message bus described in <ref> [27] </ref> to communicate the set of acceptable encodings. A sample script illustrating some simple actions is shown in Fig. 6. In the example, calls after 6 pm are forwarded to a home number, while calls whose subject header contains the name of project, are forwarded to the appropriate person.

Reference-contexts: A typical local office sees three 3-minute calls in the busy hour per line <ref> [28, p. 141] </ref>, that is, 3 BHCA (busy hour call attempts). A large PBX for 10,000 stations is designed for about 100,000 busy hour calls, i.e., BHCA of 10. Typical dimensioning of outside lines for offices assumes about one outside call per hour and station.

Reference-contexts: Here, we only consider those that do not require a conference server.

Reference-contexts: The Conference Control Channel Protocol (CCCP) [29] allows communication between different components of a conference, either located on a single host or distributed. It assumes that conference members have been notified or invited by other means, one of which may well be MUCS. The Connection Control Protocol (CCP) <ref> [30] </ref>, partially implemented in the mmcc conference controller, supports invitations and negotiation. The protocol is far more complex than MUCS, with numerous states and its own multicast reliability mechanism. Unlike MUCS, it is active during the whole conference.

Reference-contexts: The MUCS protocol currently operates under that model for the interaction of individual media, but can be used in other environments. Integration of conferencing and the World-Wide Web has also been pursued. In the Virtual Places approach <ref> [32] </ref>, a subscriber could be met via multiple media at different places (that is, pages) within the web.

Reference-contexts: The forwarding service can be offered by competing service providers that are distinct from the bit carriers, making it easy to use several different providers depending on time-of-day, caller, and the like. The MUCS protocol also needs a multicast address allocation service <ref> [33] </ref>. The re-use of the existing electronic mail address also allows to benefit from the existing infrastructure for email addresses, from address books to mailing lists, PGP keys and aliases. Interoperation of this MUCS protocol with plain old telephony (POTS), mobile telephony and ISDN remains to be investigated.

Reference-contexts: Interoperation of this MUCS protocol with plain old telephony (POTS), mobile telephony and ISDN remains to be investigated. Telephone numbers in ITU E.123 notation can be used as user names. Together with existing proposals for the integration of email and fax [34] and access to paging services <ref> [35, 36] </ref>, a complete program-controlled communication environment could then be offered. For personal mobility, the subscriber must have the possibility of securely changing the forwarding characteristics.
