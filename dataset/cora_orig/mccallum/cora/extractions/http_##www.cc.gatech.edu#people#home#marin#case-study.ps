Abstract: DRAFT Case Study: The Invention of the Telephone Marin Simina College of Computing Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, GA 30332-0280 (404) 894-5612 marin@cc.gatech.edu Abstract This case study analyzes the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. But to understand this act of creative design, we have to analyze Bell's earlier research goals. We abstract Bell's research method and the reasoning mechanisms he used that appear time and again in long-term creative problem solving and design. 1 Case Study This case study analyzes some important reasoning steps involved in the telephone invention. Bell's education was important for his future scientific goals. The study of Helmholtz's apparatus introduced Bell to electricity and was also a prerequisite for the invention of the multiple telegraph. Bell's work on the multiple telegraph inspired the invention of the telephone. The design of the telephone was officially completed in March 7, 1876, when the U.S. Patent No. 174,465 was issued. 1

Reference-contexts: In this book, he could read about: a series of vibrating plates, answering to the strings of a harp, ... each of which vibrates when struck by a particular sound, and sends off electricity to create at the end of the line the same vibrations in a corresponding plate. <ref> (Bruce, 1973, page 122) </ref> Bell could recognize that the structure and the behavior of the above design was relevant for his active goal implement the multiple telegraph. Consequently, he added the Baile's design as a design alternative to the goal implement the multiple telegraph. <p> This time, 2 This involved fastening a delicate stick to a moving ear bone and recording traces of complex waves on smoked glass, while someone spoke into the ear membrane. 9 DRAFT a new function of the device emerged 3 : transmission of voice at a distance <ref> (Bruce, 1973 p.122) </ref>. The new function was considered acoustically "interesting" and Baile's design was mentally adapted into the "harp apparatus". The harp apparatus was indexed under the "undulatory current" hypothesis.
