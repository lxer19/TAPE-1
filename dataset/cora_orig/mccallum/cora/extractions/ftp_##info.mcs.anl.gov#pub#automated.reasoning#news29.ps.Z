Abstract: In keeping with the role of AAR as the "parent" corporation for CADE, this issue includes several articles related to CADE. Of especial interest is the response of Alan Bundy, current CADE president, to proposed major changes to the CADE organization. Also included are a solicitation for sites for the next CADE conference and minutes of the July 1994 CADE meeting.

I hope other people will argue the pros and cons of the proposal through the pages of this newsletter. We need an informed debate to arrive at a well-considered decision. Until CADE-12, CADE conferences were arranged in an informal manner. The Program Committee of CADE-n would select the site and officers of CADE-n + 1. The accumulated funds of previous CADEs would be passed from Program Chair n to Program Chair n + 1, who would personally open a bank account for it. These informal arrangements seemed unsatisfactory to many of us for two main reasons. First, the current CADE officers were at considerable financial risk. If a CADE were to realize a loss, they were personally liable. Second, the transfer of money
