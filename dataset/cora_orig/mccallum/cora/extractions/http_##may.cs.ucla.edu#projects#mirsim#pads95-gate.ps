Abstract: A logic-level circuit simulator was developed in the Maisie simulation language and implemented on a distributed memory parallel architecture (IBM SP1) and a shared-memory computer (SUN Sparc1000). The distributed memory model was ported to the shared-memory architecture with no changes to the source code. Further, minimal changes were necessary to run the model with conservative or optimistic protocols. The only change was the addition of lookahead information to the model for the conservative implementation to ensure that the model did not include a zero delay cycle. The simulator was used to simulate a set of circuits from the ISCAS85 benchmark. The speedups obtained with both conservative and optimistic protocols were reported in the previous section. Experiments to measure the effectiveness of the simu lator in simulating larger circuits, including sequential circuits, are in progress.
