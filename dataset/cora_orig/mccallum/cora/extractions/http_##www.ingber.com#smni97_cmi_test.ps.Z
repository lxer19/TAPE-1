Abstract: A series of papers has developed a statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI), deriving aggregate behavior of experimentally observed columns of neurons from statistical electrical-chemical properties of synaptic interactions. While not useful to yield insights at the single neuron level, SMNI has demonstrated its capability in describing large-scale properties of short-term memory and electroencephalographic (EEG) systematics. The necessity of including nonlinear and stochastic structures in this development has been stressed. Sets of EEG and evoked potential data were fit, collected to investigate genetic predispositions to alcoholism and to extract brain signatures of short-term memory. Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), a global optimization algorithm, was used to perform maximum likelihood fits of Lagrangians defined by path integrals of multivariate conditional probabilities. Canonical momenta indicators (CMI) are thereby derived for individual's EEG data. The CMI give better signal recognition than the raw data, and can be used to advantage as correlates of behavioral states. These results give strong quantitative support for an accurate intuitive picture, portraying neocortical interactions as having common algebraic or physics mechanisms that scale across quite disparate spatial scales and functional or behavioral phenomena, i.e., describing interactions among neurons, columns of neurons, and regional masses of neurons. This paper adds to these previous investigations two important aspects, a description of how the CMI may be used in source localization, and calculations using previously ASA-fitted parameters in out-of-sample data.

Reference-contexts: It has been noted that experimental data on velocities of propagation of long-ranged fibers [38,40] and derived velocities of propagation of information across local minicolumnar interactions <ref> [2] </ref> yield comparable times scales of interactions across minicolumns of tenths of a second. Therefore, such phenomena as STM likely are inextricably dependent on interactions at local and global scales. 2.2.1.

Reference-contexts: This essentially collapses the 2 dimensional M G space down to a 1 dimensional space of most importance. Thus, the predominant physics of short-term memory and of (short-fiber contribution to) EEG phenomena takes place in a narrow ``parabolic trough'' in M G space, roughly along a diagonal line <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In general, there also will be terms linear in F/t and in F/ x. Previous calculations of EEG phenomena <ref> [5] </ref>, show that the short-fiber contribution to the a frequency and the movement of attention across the visual field are consistent with the assumption that the EEG physics is derived from an average over the uctuations of the system, e.g., represented by s in the above equation.

Reference-contexts: SMNI has detailed these constraints in models of auditory and visual cortex [4,6,15,16]. Another interesting phenomenon of STM capacity explained by SMNI is the primacy versus recency effect in STM serial processing <ref> [6] </ref>, wherein first-learned items are recalled most error-free, with last-learned items still more error-free than those in the middle [54].

In order to fit such distributions to real data, ASA has been developed, a global optimization technique, a superior variant of simulated annealing [25].

Reference-contexts: The nearest-neighbor interactions V can be modeled in greater detail by a stochastic mesoscopic neural network <ref> [14] </ref>. The SMNI papers give more detail on this derivation. <p> Then, this model is being tested to see if the potential will scale to a representative macrocolumn. The results presented here seem to confirm that this approximation is in fact quite reasonable. Future projects will develop SMNI to include higher resolution minicolumnar-minicolumnar dynamics using stochastic MNN, described above <ref> [14] </ref>. 3.4. CMI Sensitivity In the SMNI approach, information is a concept well defined in terms of the probability eigenfunctions of electrical-chemical activity of this Lagrangian. <p> A higher resolution algorithm, at the level of minicolumns, shows how short-ranged as well as long-ranged interactions among mesocolumns within and between regions can be naturally included in the SMNI theory <ref> [14] </ref>. Such fits can be performed after other source localization techniques are applied to the data, e.g., head-volume or Laplacian techniques. This still is very important, as identification of source (s), especially those that may be nonstationary, is not sufficient to describe their dynamical interaction. <p> However, the Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical ... - 34 - Lester Ingber fat tail of ASA permits parallelization of developing generated states prior to subjecting them to the acceptance test <ref> [14] </ref>. The ASA_PARALLEL OPTIONS provide parameters to easily parallelize the code, using various implementations, e.g., PVM, shared memory, etc. The scale of parallelization afforded by ASA, without violating its sampling proof, is given by a typical ratio of the number of generated to accepted states.

Reference-contexts: The underlying mathematical physics used to develop SMNI gives rise to a natural coordinate system faithful to nonlinear multivariate sets of potential data such as measured by multi-electrode EEG, canonical momenta indicators (CMI) [20,22,23]. Recent papers in finance [22,23] and in EEG systems <ref> [21] </ref> have demonstrated that CMI give enhanced signal resolutions over raw data. <p> The ranges of the a, b, f parameters were decided by using minimum and maximum values of M G G firings to keep the potential variable within the minimum and maximum values of the experimentally measured potential at each electrode site. (This corrects a typo in a previous paper <ref> [21] </ref>, where these 3 parameters were referred to as a, b, c-.) Using the above ASA OPTIONS and ranges of parameters, it was found that typically within several thousand generated states, the global minimum was approached within at least one or two significant figures of the effective Lagrangian (including the prefactor). <p> It is argued that this is the case for SMNI and its parameters, and this approach sufficed for the first study of the present data <ref> [21] </ref>, just as SMNI also has been tested in previous papers. <p> That is, when first examining the data, it was decided to to try to find sets of data from at least 10 control and 10 alcoholic subjects, each set containing at least 10 runs for each of the 3 experimental paradigms, as reported in a previous paper <ref> [21] </ref>.

Complementary Research 2.4.1. <p> In 1987, a method of fast annealing (FA) was developed [94], which permitted lowering the temperature exponentially faster, thereby statistically guaranteeing that the minimum could be found in some finite time. However, that time still could be quite long. Shortly thereafter, Very Fast Simulated Reannealing (VFSR) was developed <ref> [25] </ref>, now called Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), which is exponentially faster than FA. ASA has been applied to many problems by many people in many disciplines [27,28,95]. The feedback of many users regularly scrutinizing the source code ensures its soundness as it becomes more exible and powerful.

Reference-contexts: Experimental studies of neocortical dynamics with EEG include maps of magnitude distribution over the scalp [38,42], standard Fourier analyses of EEG time series <ref> [38] </ref>, and estimates of correlation dimension [43,44]. Other studies have emphasized that many EEG states are accurately described by a few coherent spatial modes exhibiting complex temporal behavior [29-32,38,40]. These modes are the order parameters at macroscopic scales that underpin the phase changes associated with changes of physiological state.

Reference-contexts: For extracranial EEG, it is clear that spatial resolution, i.e., the ability to distinguish between two dipole sources as their distance decreases, is different from dipole localization, i.e., the ability to locate a single dipole <ref> [40] </ref>. The development of methods to improve the spatial resolution of EEG has made it more practical to study spatial structure. For example, high resolution methods provide apparent spatial resolution in the 2-3 cm range [45]. Dipole resolution may be as good as several mm [46].

Reference-contexts: The development of methods to improve the spatial resolution of EEG has made it more practical to study spatial structure. For example, high resolution methods provide apparent spatial resolution in the 2-3 cm range <ref> [45] </ref>. Dipole resolution may be as good as several mm [46]. Some algorithms calculate the (generally non-unique) inverse-problem of determining cortical sources that are weighted/filtered by volume conductivities of concentric spheres encompassing the brain, cerebrospinal uid, skull, and scalp. <p> A straightforward approach is to calculate the surface Laplacian from spline fits to the scalp potential distribution, yielding estimates similar to those obtained using concentric spheres models of the head <ref> [45] </ref>. Other measuring techniques, e.g., MEG, can provide complementary information. These methods have their strengths and weaknesses at various spatial-temporal frequencies.

Reference-contexts: SMNI has presented a model of STM, to the extent it offers stochastic bounds for this phenomena during focused selective attention [4,6,15,47-49], transpiring on the order of tenths of a second to seconds, limited to the retention of 7 - 2 items <ref> [50] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: constraints exist even for apparently exceptional memory performers who, while they may be capable of more efficient encoding and retrieval of STM, and while they may be more efficient in ``chunking'' larger patterns of information into single items, nevertheless are limited to a STM capacity of 7 - 2 items <ref> [51] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Mechanisms for various STM phenomena have been proposed across many spatial scales <ref> [52] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Another interesting phenomenon of STM capacity explained by SMNI is the primacy versus recency effect in STM serial processing [6], wherein first-learned items are recalled most error-free, with last-learned items still more error-free than those in the middle <ref> [54] </ref>. The basic assumption being made is that a pattern of neuronal firing that persists for many t cycles is a candidate to store the ``memory'' of activity that gav e rise to this pattern.

Reference-contexts: A proposal has been advanced that STM is processed by information coded in approximately 40-Hz (approximately 2.5 foldings of t ) bursts per stored memory, permitting up to seven such memories to be processed serially within single wav es of lower frequencies on the order of 5 to 12 Hz <ref> [55] </ref>. To account for the observed duration of STM, they propose that observed after-depolarization (ADP) at synaptic sites, affected by the action of relatively long-time acting neuromodulators, e.g., acetylcholine and serotonin, acts to regularly refresh the stored memories in subsequent oscillatory cycles.

Reference-contexts: A recent study of the action of neuromodulators in the neocortex supports the premise of their effects on broad spatial and temporal scales <ref> [56] </ref>, but the ADP model is much more specific in its proposed spatial and temporal inuences. SMNI does not detail any specific synaptic or neuronal mechanisms that might refresh these most-likely states to reinforce multiple short-term memories [18].

Reference-contexts: A recent study with realistic EEG wav e equations strongly suggests that if chaos exists in a deterministic limit, it does not survive in macroscopic stochastic neocortex <ref> [64] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The acceptance distribution decides probabilistically whether to stay in a new lower valley or to bounce out of it. All the generating and acceptance distributions depend on temperatures. In 1984 <ref> [93] </ref>, it was established that SA possessed a proof that, by carefully controlling the rates of cooling of temperatures, it could statistically find the best minimum, e.g., the lowest valley of our example above.

Reference-contexts: This was good news for people trying to solve hard problems which could not be solved by other algorithms. The bad news was that the guarantee was only good if they were willing to run SA forever. In 1987, a method of fast annealing (FA) was developed <ref> [94] </ref>, which permitted lowering the temperature exponentially faster, thereby statistically guaranteeing that the minimum could be found in some finite time. However, that time still could be quite long.

Reference-contexts: Self optimization of such parameters can be very useful for production runs of complex systems. 3.4. Parallel Code It is quite difficult to directly parallelize an SA algorithm [27], e.g., without incurring very restrictive constraints on temperature schedules <ref> [96] </ref>, or violating an associated sampling proof [97]. However, the Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical ... - 34 - Lester Ingber fat tail of ASA permits parallelization of developing generated states prior to subjecting them to the acceptance test [14].
