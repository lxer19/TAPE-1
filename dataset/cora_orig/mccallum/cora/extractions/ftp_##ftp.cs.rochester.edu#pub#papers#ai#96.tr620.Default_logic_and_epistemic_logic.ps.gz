Abstract: When we work with information from multiple sources, the formats of the knowledge bases may not be uniform. It would be desirable to be able to combine a knowledge base of default rules with one containing autoepistemic formulas. Previous works on relating default logic and autoepistemic logic mostly impose some constraints on autoepistemic logic, and thus are not suitable for combining the two logics. We first present a fixed point formulation of autoepistemic logic analogous to that of default logic. Then we introduce a possible world framework with a partition structure, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of accessibility as linking alternate "possible" worlds. We show that both default logic and au-toepistemic logic can be characterized using this framework, and the constraints imposed on the possible world structures correspond to the requirements in the fixed point formulations. Casting both default logic and autoepistemic logic in a common framework is important for developing a semantics applicable to the two logics, both separately and combined.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these efforts impose additional constraints on autoepistemic logic, such as requiring stronger groundedness or using different base modal systems. Thus, although default logic can be translated into some variants of au-toepistemic logic, the two logics cannot be easily combined using these translation schemes. Gottlob <ref> [Gottlob, 1993] </ref> gave a translation for embedding default logic into unrestricted autoepistemic logic, which could be used for such purposes. We address the syntactic and semantic relationship between default logic and autoepis-temic logic from slightly different angles. <p> This suggests that the 4 specific syntactic form of the translation is not crucial, since we can choose from a whole family of translations as long as they adhere to the simple schema outlined above. Gottlob <ref> [Gottlob, 1993] </ref> proposed a schema for translating default logic into standard autoepistemic logic by adding a "grounding formula" to a default theory. This can serve as a starting point for combining the two logics.

Reference-contexts: Most of the efforts in relating the two logics focus on the syntactic manipulation of default rules to embed default logic into autoepistemic logic using some particular translation schema and modal system <ref> [Konolige, 1988; Marek and Truszczynski, 1990; Truszczynski, 1991b; Truszczynski, 1991a] </ref>. However, most of these efforts impose additional constraints on autoepistemic logic, such as requiring stronger groundedness or using different base modal systems. <p> Thus, we only need to specify the kernel when we refer to stable theories. An ideal rational belief set should contain the premise set A, as well as be stable and grounded in A. Such autoepistemic theories are called stable expansions of A. Konolige <ref> [Konolige, 1988; Konolige, 1989] </ref> showed that in the modal system K45, every well formed formula of ML is equivalent to a formula of the normal form :Lff _ Lfi 1 _ : : : _ Lfi n _ fl, where ff; fi 1 ; : : : ; fi n ; <p> One common characteristics for many of these works is that autoepistemic logic needs to be somewhat modified to exclude the stable expansions that do not correspond to default extensions.

These strongly grounded expansions are sensitive to the syntactic representation of the formulas. <p> The choice of translations also differ from system to system. However, it is not clear why, for example, a justification of a default rule should be translated as :L:fi i in one system <ref> [Konolige, 1988] </ref> and L:L:fi i in another [Truszczynski, 1991b]: should it be that :fi i is not believed, or that :fi i is believed to be not believed?

Given the similarity between the fixed point formulations of default logic and autoepistemic logic, we can also specify a possible model for an autoepistemic theory using the possible order framework. <p> Note that the last element W l of the autoepistemic possible model is the same as the complete S5 structure in Moore's formulation of possible world semantics <ref> [Moore, 1984] </ref>. Although our formulation using the possible model is not simpler, it provides a more pro cedural characterization. 4 The modal operator 2 we use corresponds to the operator L in autoepistemic logic. 5 This condition is not strictly necessary.
