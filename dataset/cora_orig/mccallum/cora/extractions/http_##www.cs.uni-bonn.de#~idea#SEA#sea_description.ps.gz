Reference-contexts: The Interpreter supports most of the features of Chimera | as defined in the Consolidated Specification (<ref> [CM93] </ref>) | but does not aim at providing particularly efficient or refined implementations of individual concepts. There are a few points where the implemented version of Chimera deviates from the version in [CM93]. Apart from these points, the functionality of Chimera has been enhanced by low-level schema evolution operations for the Chimera Interpreter programming interface in order to enable basic changes of an application schema.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, strategic decisions have to be taken by the SEAC which may lead to the application of different schema evolution techniques (cf. <ref> [Lem94b] </ref>). Basic schema evolution commands are essentially the commands described in the SEA tool specification ([Lem94a]), e.g., the addition of an attribute to a class, which are supported by the CSME for direct execution on the Chimera Interpreter.

Reference-contexts: Looking for an elegant solution for the problem of schema management, we decided to use the Chimera DBMS itself for this task. As we have already pointed out in <ref> [Lem95] </ref>, this requires the definition of a meta schema for the representation of Chimera schemas, but immediately offers all the means the Chimera DBMS provides for, e.g., browsing, querying, integrity checking, and trigger activation.
