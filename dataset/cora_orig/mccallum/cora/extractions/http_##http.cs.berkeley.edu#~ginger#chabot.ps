Title: Chabot: Retrieval from a Relational Database of Images  
Author: Virginia E. Ogle Michael Stonebraker 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: Chabot is a picture retrieval system for a database that will eventually include over 500,000 digitized multi-resolution images. We describe the design and construction of this system which uses the relational database management system POSTGRES for storing and managing the images and their associated textual data. For retrieval, Chabot uses tools provided by POSTGRES, such as representation of complex data types, a rich query language, and extensible types and functions. To implement retrieval from the current collection of 11,643 images, Chabot integrates the use of stored text and other data types with content-based analysis of the images to perform concept queries.

Reference-contexts: In the DBMS community, image database research focuses on storage methods for large objects: spatial data such as geographical maps may be stored in structures such as R-trees <ref> [2] </ref>. Current work includes Digital Equipment Corporations multimedia object support for Rdb [7], DECs relational database. Multimedia object files are physically stored in segments on a WORM device and within the database as binary large objects (BLOBs), guaranteeing DBMS functionality such as transactions and concurrency for these objects.

Reference-contexts: The User Interface We have implemented a graphical point-and-click Motif-like interface for Chabot written in Tcl/Tk <ref> [4] </ref>. The interface is designed to prevent accidental corruption of data while browsing the database; the main screen gives the user three options: find, edit, and load. The database can be modified only via the edit and load screens and user authorization for these screens is required.

Reference-contexts: DWR would like to fish from the database rather than present a sample image for matching, and image-by-image review to delineate content features is not feasible because of the large number of images in the collection. The Photobook project <ref> [5] </ref> at the M.I.T. Media Lab seeks to circumvent the issue of pre-determined search criteria by storing enough information about each image so that run-time computations are possible.

However, this project is not investigating ways to incorporate content-based queries to retrieve images.

Reference-contexts: The user can edit the concept file, make copies of the file available to other users, and incorporate others concepts in the file. Testing To test our content analysis, we measured the recall and precision <ref> [8] </ref> of some of the concept queries that are shown in the User Interface section. Recall is the proportion of relevant materials retrieved, while precision quantifies the proportion of retrieved materials that are relevant to the search.

Reference-contexts: We plan to integrate the Chabot schema with those of the geographical and environmental datasets of other research projects at UC Berkeley such as satellite imagery, aerial photography, and environmental reports. One planned enhancement is to generate longitude and latitude coordinates for the DWR images using GIPSY <ref> [12] </ref> a system for extracting these coordinates from textual place names. Using this technique, a location name like El Cerrito that is attached to one of the DWR images can be associated with spatial data that contains longitudinal coordinates. 18
