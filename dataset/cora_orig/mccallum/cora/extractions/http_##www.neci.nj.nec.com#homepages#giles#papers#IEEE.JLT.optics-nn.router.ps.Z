Title: Routing in Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks: a Neural Network Solution  
Author: C. Lee Giles yz Mark W. Goudreau 
Abstract: There has been much interest in using optics to implement computer interconnection networks. However, there has been little discussion of any routing methodologies besides those already used in electronics. In this paper, a neural network routing methodology is proposed that can generate control bits for a broad range of optical multistage interconnection networks (OMINs). Though we present no optical implementation of this methodology, we illustrate its control for an optical interconnection network. These OMINs can be used as communication media for distributed computing systems. The routing methodology makes use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that functions as a parallel computer for generating the routes. The neural network routing scheme can be applied to electrical as well as optical interconnection networks. However, since the ANN can be implemented using optics, this routing approach is especially appealing for an optical computing environment. Although the ANN does not always generate the best solution, the parallel nature of the ANN computation may make this routing scheme faster than conventional routing approaches, especially for OMINs that have an irregular structure. Furthermore, the ANN router is fault-tolerant. Results are shown for generating routes in a 16 fi 16, 3-stage OMIN.

Reference-contexts: The logic block Logic2 is required to convert the routing array solution of the neural network into a crosspoint form that the interconnection network can understand. The construction 3 of these logic blocks should be a straightforward process. Further information on interconnection networks can be found in <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. There has already been some interesting work done on utilizing Hopfield model neural networks to facilitate communication through interconnection networks. <p> The OMIN has 12 of these switches. Each crossbar switch in the OMIN is connected to each crossbar switch in the neighboring stages. This MIN is capable of routing any input/output permutation. Its construction is similar to that of the standard Benes network <ref> [1, 25] </ref>, although the Benes network's basic building block is a 2 fi 2 crossbar switch. However, the OMIN has the same type of recursive structure as the standard Benes network. The 3-dimensional routing problem will now be reduced to a 2-dimensional routing problem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) of the type that were described by Hopfield <ref> [13] </ref> are ca pable of finding good solutions for certain optimization problems [14]. Furthermore, these ANNs can also solve certain constraint satisfaction problems. Constraint satisfaction prob lems can often be modeled as optimization problems that have numerous correct solutions that are of equal value. <p> That is, the ANN is not totally connected. At the beginning of a message cycle, the neurons have a random output voltage. If the ANN settles in one of the global minima, the problem will have been solved. A synchronous Hopfield model neural network is used <ref> [14, 13] </ref>. The value of t , from [14], is set to 1. <p> When different groups of input-output ports need to be connected, it is only the input bias currents of boundary neurons that are affected. Equation 8 quantifies that change. If the circuit implementation of the ANN from <ref> [13] </ref> is utilized, changing to a new set of desired messages corresponds to reducing the input bias currents to illegal nodes in the first and last stages of the ANN. The connectivity matrix is defined totally by the MIN that is chosen, and so the conductances need not change.
