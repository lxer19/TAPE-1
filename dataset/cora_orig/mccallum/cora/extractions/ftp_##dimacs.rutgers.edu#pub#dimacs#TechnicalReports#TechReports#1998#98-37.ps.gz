Reference-contexts: The solvability of this equation was of interest prior to the interior-point research which began with Karmarkar's algorithm. However, the problem was primarily studied in the context of nonnegative matrices, see e.g. Sinkhorn [38], Brualdi, Prater and Schneider <ref> [2] </ref>, Marshall and Olkin [29], and Kalantari [17].

Reference-contexts: We shall refer to the HP where (x) = 1 2 x T Qx, and W = &lt; n , as Gordan's HP, since it is very much related to Gordan's theorem. According to this theorem, one of the first known dualities on linear inequalities (see Dantzig <ref> [3] </ref>, and Schrijver [37]): given any m fi n real matrix H, either there exists x 0, x 6= 0 such that Hx = 0, 6 BAHMAN KALANTARI or there exists y such that H T y &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: The fourth type is the second-order cone (also known as Lorentz cone), and the fifth type is a 27-dimensional cone. For results regarding cones, see Koecher [25], Rothaus [36], Vinberg [41], and Faraut and A. Koranyi <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: knowledge the results in [14], and [17] established for the first time the precise relationship between SP and HSP, and for general , although for linear a resemblance of Karmarkar potential function minimization and the logarithmic potential minimization was claimed in the paper of Gill, Murray, Saunders, Tomlin, and Wright, <ref> [7] </ref>. We now list four distinct scaling dualities over the nonnegative cone, called the Weak Scaling Duality, the Scaling Duality Theorem, the Scaling Separation Duality, and the Uniform Scaling Duality. <p> Also, under mild assumptions it can be shown that x fl t converges to the minimizer of g (see Fiacco and McCormick [5], also Gill et all <ref> [7] </ref>). Thus, even for LP the proposed path-following algorithm of this paper is for instance different than that of Gonzaga's polynomial-time path-following algorithm for LP over bounded domains, or other path-following methods, see [9], including those based on primal-dual formulations, see also Nesterov and Nemirovskii [31].

Reference-contexts: We mention that path-following algorithms for Karmarkar's canonical LP have been given before, see e.g. Goldfarb and Shaw <ref> [8] </ref>. However, the proposed path-following algorithm of this paper, although using many results, including the theory of self-concordance, is conceptually simpler than these algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the feasibility problem in linear programming can often be trivially reduced to the geometric problem of testing if the convex-hull of a given set of points contains the origin. In fact this simple geometric problem, considered by Gordan, <ref> [10] </ref>, more than a century ago, is equivalent to several HP formulation of linear programming (over the rational or algebraic numbers), as well as Karmarkar's canonical LP.

Reference-contexts: In fact, using Nesterov and Nemirovskii's universal barrier, Guler <ref> [11] </ref> shows that F (x) is within a constant factor of the universal barrier. Thus, F (x) is strongly self-concordant. <p> The cone K is said to be homogeneous if given x; y 2 K ffi , there exists an invertible linear transformation A, such that A (K) = K; A (x) = y:(3.7) For homogeneous cones, F (x) can easily be shown to be strongly self-concordant, see e.g. Guler <ref> [11] </ref> (Theorem 4.3). Thus, for homogeneous cones, one need not resort to Nesterov and Nemirovskii's theorem on the existence of universal barriers. SCALING DUALITIES AND HOMOGENEOUS PROGRAMMING 15 3.2. The scaling equation: algebraic characterization of the solvability of SP. <p> The fourth type is the second-order cone (also known as Lorentz cone), and the fifth type is a 27-dimensional cone.

Reference-contexts: Scaling dualities. Scaling dualities are theorems of the alternative that relate exact and *- approximate solvability of the four problems HP, SP, HSP, and ASP. We shall summarize these scaling dualities over the nonnegative orthant. These dualities have been established in the papers Kalantari <ref> [12] </ref>, [13], [14], and [17]. The connection between linear programming and matrix scaling was established in Kalantari [13], via a scaling duality. <p> In view of the scaling dualities the algorithm is also capable of solving a decision version of SP, HSP, or ASP.

A potential-reduction algorithm. The projective algorithm, stated above, tests the solvability of HP, but only a decision version of the remaining three problems, SP, HSP, or ASP. This projective algorithm can be viewed as a homogeneous potential-reduction algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Geometrically, either the convex-hull of the columns of H contains the origin, or there exists a hyperplane (induced by y) separating these points from the origin. On the one hand, when Q is indefinite, Gordan's HP is NP-complete, see <ref> [13] </ref>. On the other hand, linear programming over the rational or algebraic numbers can be formulated as Gordan's HP with a positive semidefinite Q (see [20]). This can be done as follows. <p> For positive semidefinite matrix scaling over the algebraic numbers, see [20], and for nonnegative matrix scaling, also see [18]. When Q is an arbitrary symmetric matrix, the corresponding ASP is NP-hard (see [24]), and the corresponding HP is NP-complete (see <ref> [13] </ref>). Aside from linear programming, many other linearly constrained convex programming problems can be formulated as an HP over the nonnegative cone. For instance, using ordinary dualities, see e.g. <p> Scaling dualities. Scaling dualities are theorems of the alternative that relate exact and *- approximate solvability of the four problems HP, SP, HSP, and ASP. We shall summarize these scaling dualities over the nonnegative orthant. These dualities have been established in the papers Kalantari [12], <ref> [13] </ref>, [14], and [17].

The connection between linear programming and matrix scaling was established in Kalantari [13], via a scaling duality. In a subsequent technical report, Kalantari [14], whose more general version appeared as Kalantari [17], it was proved that the stationary points of and X can be obtained from each other by scalar multiplication. <p> But this coincides with ff 0 . The above result was previously established for the case of K = &lt; n + in Kalantari [14] (Lemma 3.1 in [17]). The following theorem for a quadratic form over K = &lt; n + , was established previously in Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>, and for general over this cone in [17]. We shall refer to this theorem as the Weak Scaling Duality/Homogeneous Potential Inequality Theorem. This theorem gives a nonconvex version of the Scaling Duality Theorem to be proved in the next section. <p> We will now state three important applications of the theorem. Before doing so we state the following immediate consequence, already generalizing a theorem on matrix scaling (see (2.12), Marshall and Olkin [29], and Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>, [17]). Corollary 5.4. Let Q be an n fi n positive semidefinite symmetric matrix such that x T Qx has no nontrivial zero in &lt; n + . Then, given any natural number k, there exists a positive diagonal matrix D such that D k QDe = e: Proof.

Thus, any zero of over W is also a minimizer, hence a stationary point. Note that Proposition 3.20 (originally proved in Kalantari <ref> [14] </ref> for HP over the nonnegative orthant) is not true if p = 1, e.g. if is linear. <p> In particular, if we choose ff so that (ffd) = =p, for this choice of ff, ffd is a stationary point of .

Reference-contexts: Conversely, the convex-hull problem can be formulated as Karmarkar's HP by letting (ff; x) = ff, W = f (x; ff) : Hx ffHe = 0g, e = (1; : : :; 1) T 2 &lt; n , and K the nonnegative orthant in &lt; n+1 . In <ref> [16] </ref>, we described a variant of Karmarkar's algorithm with simple analysis for solving the Karmarkar canonical LP. This algorithm either computes d 2 W " K ffi such that P d Dc &gt; 0, or it computes a nontrivial zero of c T x over W " K.

However, the problem was primarily studied in the context of nonnegative matrices, see e.g. Sinkhorn [38], Brualdi, Prater and Schneider [2], Marshall and Olkin [29], and Kalantari <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Why should one assume that the convex-hull of a given set of points contains the origin, when this is precisely the problem being tested? Perhaps this assumption stems from the fact that in Karmarkar's first version of the projective algorithm, <ref> [21] </ref>, the minimum objective value is assumed to be zero. However, in the version appearing in [22], the assumption is removed. Karmarkar's HP can be formulated as Gordan's HP, simply by taking (x) = (c T x) 2 + x T A T Ax.

Reference-contexts: Let Q = H T H. Since Q is positive semidefinite, the convex-hull problem is trivially equivalent to the corresponding Gordan's HP. Karmarkar's canonical linear programming, <ref> [22] </ref>, is the special case of HP where (x) = c T x. Most literature on interior-point algorithms, when referring to Karmarkar's canonical LP, automatically assumes that the corresponding is zero. This assumption is unnecessary and it ignores the fundamental dualities that relate HP to SP, HSP, or ASP. <p> However, in the version appearing in <ref> [22] </ref>, the assumption is removed. Karmarkar's HP can be formulated as Gordan's HP, simply by taking (x) = (c T x) 2 + x T A T Ax.

We will rederive the polynomial-time linear programming/matrix scaling algorithm described in <ref> [23] </ref>, but from a fresh point of view, and even with simpler analysis. In particular, the new derivation emphasizes the dependence of the algorithm in the fundamental separation theorem of Gordan, rather than the matrix scaling duality theorem according to which precisely one of the two problems is solvable.

Reference-contexts: The solvability of this equation was of interest prior to the interior-point research which began with Karmarkar's algorithm. However, the problem was primarily studied in the context of nonnegative matrices, see e.g. Sinkhorn [38], Brualdi, Prater and Schneider [2], Marshall and Olkin <ref> [29] </ref>, and Kalantari [17]. It is interesting and surprising that the earlier application and existence theorems on the diagonal matrix scaling equation preceded the discovery of the fact that the vector d fl = D fl e is a stationary point of the corresponding logarithmic potential function. <p> We will now state three important applications of the theorem. Before doing so we state the following immediate consequence, already generalizing a theorem on matrix scaling (see (2.12), Marshall and Olkin <ref> [29] </ref>, and Kalantari [13], [17]).

Reference-contexts: This divergence resulted in several breakthroughs on convex programming, such as Renegar's work, [34], on the complexity of the path-following method of centers for linear programming, and Nesterov and Nemirovskii's fundamental theory on the class of self-concordant convex programming, <ref> [31] </ref>. However, as we shall establish in this paper, the HP formulation of convex programs, initiated by Karmarkar for LP, has many advantages of its own as it gives rise to the scaling problems, the scaling dualities, and new algorithms. <p> We will also see that the analogue of this algorithm for solving the HP formulation of conic LP is simpler than Nesterov and Nemirovskii's corresponding algorithm (see Chapter 4 of <ref> [31] </ref>). Moreover, the algorithm is more powerful than Nesterov and Nemirovskii's algorithm, since additionally it can also solve any of the other three problems, SP, HSP, and ASP, in polynomial-time. <p> Thus, even for LP the proposed path-following algorithm of this paper is for instance different than that of Gonzaga's polynomial-time path-following algorithm for LP over bounded domains, or other path-following methods, see [9], including those based on primal-dual formulations, see also Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref>. In the case of f (t) , under the assumption of fi-compatibility of , the existence of the central-path can be established from a theorem on self-concordance (see Theorem 3.23). However, in general the proof of the existence of the central-path employs our new Convex Conic Programming Duality. <p> By applying a duality for conic LP, developed by Nesterov and Nemirovskii (see <ref> [31] </ref>, Chapter 4), the conic LP formulation of convex programs in turn can be reformulated as a special case of HP with a linear objective. <p> Semidefinite programming finds applications in combinatorial optimization, as well as eigenvalue problems (see e.g. [26], [33], [1], [40]), and is a special case of the general class of self-concordant programming, defined and studied in <ref> [31] </ref>. It is natural to ask if the scaling dualities proved for K = &lt; n + extend to the HP formulation of semidefinite programming, or more generally to the HP formulation of self-concordant programming, or even to a general HP. <p> The notion of fi-compatibility and self-concordance are defined by Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref>. <p> The existence of -logarithmically homogeneous barriers and -normal barriers for the cone K of HP is a consequence of some old and new results. Nesterov and Nemirovskii proved the existence of a universal strongly self-concordant barrier for any convex set with nonempty interior (see Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref>, Theorem 2.5.1), which for convex cones reduces to a -logarithmically homogeneous barrier. Since by multiplication of this barrier by an appropriate constant the parameter of self-concordance can be made to be one, this ensures the existence of a -normal barrier for the cone K of HP. <p> Remark. Properties (P5) and (P6) of F are stated in Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref>. However, these are actually a consequence of the first two well-known properties, as applied to the function (x) = exp (F (x)). Definition 3.9. <p> Similarly, corresponding to f (t) , y t (d), t (d), and d 0 t = N EW (f (t) ; d) are defined analogously. The following theorem is an adaptation of three significant results of Nesterov and Nemirovskii in <ref> [31] </ref>, combining them into a format suitable for our conic problem. It is a theorem that will be used repeatedly in the paper. This theorem combines a theorem characterizing basic properties of Newton's method under self-concordance ([31], Theorem 2.2.2), a theorem on the main property of self-concordant families ([31], Theorem 3.1.1), <p> Proof. We have to verify that it satisfies the three conditions of Definition 5.1. Firstly, the set K ff (F ) = fx 2 K ffi : F (x) ffg is closed. To prove the second condition, from Corollary 2.3.1 in Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref> (page 39), we have r 2 F (x)[h; h] 1=2 rF (x)[h]:(5.3) If q (ff) = F (x + ffv), then q 0 (ff) = rF (x + ffv)[v]. Since F is strictly convex, r 2 F (x)[h; h] &gt; 0. Thus, q 0 (ff) &lt; 0. <p> Since F is strictly convex, r 2 F (x)[h; h] &gt; 0. Thus, q 0 (ff) &lt; 0. To prove the third condition, from Proposition 2.3.4 of Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref> (page 34), for any x; y 2 K ffi , we have rF (x)[y x] 1:(5.4) In particular, q 0 (ff) = rF (x + ffv)[v] = ff 1 :(5.5) Thus, 1=ff q 0 (ff) &lt; 0. <p> While the algorithm relies on some basic properties of self-concordance given in Nesterov and Nemirovskii's Theorem (Theorem 3.23), it in fact gives a simpler and more general algorithm than their corresponding algorithm for solving the HP formulation of conic LP (see Chapter 4 of Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref>). Given d &gt; 0, the algorithm simply replaces d with d 0 = N EW ( ; d) and repeats. By making use of the Scaling Duality Theorem (Theorem 5.5), we will see that this simple algorithm solves the desired problems. We need some preliminary results. Lemma 9.1. <p> Remark. Even for (x) linear, the above algorithm is simpler than a potential-reduction algorithm described by Nesterov and Nemirovskii <ref> [31] </ref> (Chapter 4) which is essentially capable of solving *-HP, where it is assumed that = 0. We have shown that we need not make any assumptions on , and that the algorithm is also capable of solving *-SP, *-HSP, and *-ASP (when a bounded operator-cone is available). <p> Then, (x) is p 3-compatible with F (i.e., is strongly self-concordant with parameter a = 1=(1 + p Proof. Since in the presence of a subspace, strong self-concordance is preserved (see Proposition 2.1.1 in <ref> [31] </ref>), to prove the theorem we may assume W = &lt; n . Also, without loss of generality we may assume that c = 0.
