Title: 2D Observers for Human 3D Object Recognition?  
Author: Zili Liu Daniel Kersten 
Affiliation: NEC Research Institute  University of Minnesota  
Abstract: Converging evidence has shown that human object recognition depends on familiarity with the images of an object. Further, the greater the similarity between objects, the stronger is the dependence on object appearance, and the more important two-dimensional (2D) image information becomes. These findings, however, do not rule out the use of 3D structural information in recognition, and the degree to which 3D information is used in visual memory is an important issue. Liu, Knill, & Kersten (1995) showed that any model that is restricted to rotations in the image plane of independent 2D templates could not account for human performance in discriminating novel object views. We now present results from models of generalized radial basis functions (GRBF), 2D nearest neighbor matching that allows 2D affine transformations, and a Bayesian statistical estimator that integrates over all possible 2D affine transformations. The performance of the human observers relative to each of the models is better for the novel views than for the familiar template views, suggesting that humans generalize better to novel views from template views. The Bayesian estimator yields the optimal performance with 2D affine transformations and independent 2D templates. Therefore, models of 2D affine matching operations with independent 2D templates are unlikely to account for human recognition performance.

Reference-contexts: We consider the problem of viewpoint dependence in human recognition. A recent debate in human object recognition has focused on the dependence of recognition performance on viewpoint <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. Depending on the experimental conditions, an observer's ability to recognize a familiar object from novel viewpoints is impaired to varying degrees. A central assumption in the debate is the equivalence in viewpoint dependence and recognition performance.

Reference-contexts: The model's performance as a function of viewpoint parallels that of human observers. This observation has led to the conclusion that the human visual system may indeed, as does the model, use 2D stored views with GRBF interpolation to recognize 3D objects <ref> [2] </ref>. Such a conclusion, however, overlooks implementational constraints in the model, because the model's performance also depends on its implementations. Conceivably, a model with some 3D information of the objects can also mimic human performance, so long as it is appropriately implemented.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2 shows the threshold performance. We use statistical efficiency E to compare human to model performance. E is defined as the information used by humans relative to the ideal observer <ref> [3] </ref> : E = (d 0 human =d 0 ideal ) 2 , where d 0 is the discrimination index.

Reference-contexts: Image information has to be factored out first, and the ideal observer provides the means to do this. The second aspect of an ideal observer is that it is implementation free. Consider the GRBF model <ref> [5] </ref>, as compared with human object recognition (see below).

Reference-contexts: The V-Shaped objects were used in the 2D affine case as a benchmark. If human performance increases with increasing structural regularity of the objects, this would lend support to the hypothesis that humans have used 3D information in the task. 2.6 Measuring performance A stair-case procedure <ref> [7] </ref> was used to track the observers' performance at 75% correct level for the learned and novel views, respectively. There were 120 trials for the humans, and 2000 trials for each of the models.
