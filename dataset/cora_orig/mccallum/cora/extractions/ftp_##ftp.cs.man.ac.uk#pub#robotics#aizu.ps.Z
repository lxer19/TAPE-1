Title: An Episodic Mapping Algorithm for Mobile Robot Self-Localisation: "Meaning" through Self-Organisation 1

Abstract: This paper presents an episodic mapping mechanism used for the self-localisation of autonomous mobile robots. A two layer self organising neural network classifies perceptual and episodic information to identify "perceptual landmarks" (and thus the robot's position in the world) uniquely. Through this process ambiguous and redundant sensory information is used to generate meaningful information to a mobile robot.

Reference-contexts: While tasks that require only either random exploration or following canonical paths (such as paths marked by induction loops, beacons, or other markers) can be achieved by low-level behaviour based control (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>), more complex navigation tasks for mobile robots (such as for example delivery tasks) require the robot to determine its current position, the goal position, and the required motion between the two.

Reference-contexts: Localisation performance was assessed using the entropy H (LjR), which determines the correlation between locus and map response (the lower H (LjR), the stronger that correlation, i.e. the better the localisation performance). A detailed discussion of this measure can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: episodes of perceptions, freak signals will indeed result in distorted perceptions, but even those distorted perceptions are normally still similar enough to a target perception to remain identifiable. 2.3 First layer: Static mapping The mapbuilding component used in the static mapbuilding paradigm is a two dimensional self-organising feature map (SOFM, <ref> [7] </ref>) of m x m units (m=9 or m=12 in our experiments). The input to the SOFM consists of the robot's 16 infrared sensor readings. Whenever the robot has moved more than 25 cm, a 16-element input vector to the first self-organising feature map is generated.

Reference-contexts: all sixteen infrared sensor signals and the output of layer 2 is again a topological map, the response of the episodic mapping system is far less sensitive to freak sensory perceptions than a mapping system that uses episodes of raw sensory data as input (such as the system presented in <ref> [12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Only through calibration using exteroception can this error be removed (a recent example of such a system is presented in <ref> [19] </ref>). Drift errors are inherent and not an engineering problem more precise wheel encoders will simply mean that the proprioception-based navigation system will function correctly for a longer period of time.
