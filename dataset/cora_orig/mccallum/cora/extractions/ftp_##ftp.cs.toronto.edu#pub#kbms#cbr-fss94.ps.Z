Abstract: The document presents an approach to judging relevance of retrieved information based on a novel approach to similarity assessment. Contrary to other systems, we define relevance measures (context in similarity) at query time. This is necessary if since without a context in similarity one cannot guarantee that similar items will also be relevant.

Reference-contexts: The second approach is more favorable because of flexibility it provides and because it gives us additional information for relevance judgment. It is this additional information which allows us to answer the question "how are the items similar?". Similarity theories developed so far (e.g., <ref> [Tve77, Hol85, Lea92, SOS92, Mic93] </ref>) do not support relevance assessment if the context is changed.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, one may use similarity-based retrieval system to find relevant approximations to the required information. There are two types of similarity-based retrieval systems: 1. Similarity relations among items are predefined. According to our definition of similarity <ref> [JL94] </ref>, this approach can be characterized as a limited similarity in retrieval since the context is fixed. Thus, similarity holds only in a predefined context which is the measure used in relevance assessment. 2.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, similarity between items in the information base may be changed in different situations because of context change <ref> [Jur94] </ref> and this system would not capture this change effectively. The second approach is more favorable because of flexibility it provides and because it gives us additional information for relevance judgment. It is this additional information which allows us to answer the question "how are the items similar?". <p> In other words, context in similarity is a relevance measure. Even though similarity is neither symmetric nor transitive in general, context allows for judging when similarity is transitive, symmetric and monotonic <ref> [Jur94] </ref>. In the example presented in Figure 1, the goal is to retrieve all items, similar in the specified context, from an information base. On the one hand, if the context is area, as large as the specified circle, then items a, e and d are similar (see Example 1). <p> Relevant items are located based on what is specified in context. The relevance of the retrieved information can be assessed even if the original query is automatically fine-tuned <ref> [Jur94] </ref>. 3 Similarity Function Using the presented approach, we define similarity as a function with three parameters: a set of items (SI), a context () and an information base ( SI). A set of items and a context may be either a constant or a variable (var SI, var ). <p> A set of items and a context may be either a constant or a variable (var SI, var ). This definition is flexible enough to be widely applicable in different tasks, e.g., comparison, retrieval, evaluation and analysis (see <ref> [Jur94] </ref>). The same similarity function is used in these tasks, with set of items and context being either variable or constant. <p> Then, the more restrictive context is used, the less items will satisfy it and vice versa. Thus, if the returned answer is not satisfactory - either too many or only a few items are retrieved the system may alter the initial context accordingly <ref> [Jur94] </ref>, to converge to a more suitable answer: * if less items than required are retrieved context should be relaxed, i.e., context becomes less specific; thus, more items would satisfy it; * if too many items are retrieved context should be constrained, i.e., context becomes more specific; thus, less items would <p> This flexibility allows us to specify complex (but necessary) relations among attribute declarations more easily. In order to judge whether the final context ( n ) can be used to retrieve relevant information, we use mono-tonicity and transitivity of similarity in context <ref> [Jur94] </ref>. From our definition of similarity, all items in SI i are equivalent in i , however, init may not be equivalent to i .

Context in similarity allows for finding information approximation by attention focusing on relevant parts of knowledge.Thus, what is similar in a specified context is considered relevant. In other words, context in similarity is a relevance measure.
