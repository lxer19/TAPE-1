Abstract: This paper discusses the feasibility of using configuration space (C-space) as a means of visualization and control in operator-guided real-time motion of a robot arm manipulator. The motivation is to improve performance of the human operator in tasks involving the manipulator motion in an environment with obstacles. Unlike some other motion planning tasks, operators are known to make expensive mistakes in such tasks, even in a simpler two-dimensional case. Using an example of a two-dimensional arm manipulator, we show that translating the problem into C-space improves the operator performance remarkably, on the order of magnitude compared to the usual work space control.

Reference-contexts: Performance is very poor in a variety of these movement planning tasks when time is not a constraint (the Shuttle arm, for example); it becomes progressively worse in real-time operation, in three-dimensional (3D) vs 2D tasks, and when system dynamics are involved (masses, inertia etc.). Experiments with human subjects <ref> [4, 5] </ref> suggest that the problem is in the peculiarities of human spatial reasoning: humans have difficulty handling simultaneous interaction with objects at multiple points of the device's body, or motion that involves mechanical joints (such as in arm manipulators), or dynamic tasks. <p> Success in this area will also mean applicability of the approach to a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. Computer algorithms for motion planning with incomplete information are available (e.g. [6]). Experiments with human subjects operating in an unknown maze <ref> [4, 5] </ref> suggest that humans might be able to handle this case as well.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, these experiments confirm the expected fact that in a maze-searching problem, if information is provided about the whole maze (a bird's-eye view), 1 environment with stationary obstacles. human performance is well above the fastest computer with the best known algorithms <ref> [6] </ref>. This contrast in the subjects' performance in the two tasks above poses a question as to whether a human-machine interface, perhaps with adequate machine intelligence, can be developed to improve human performance is such applications. The current work is an attempt to answer this question. <p> A geodesic line between two points on the torus (a straight line in the plane ( 1 , 2 )) is the "shortest path" between the points: four such paths can actually appear <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.1 Motion Control in C-space We will now attempt to control the arm motion indirectly, via its point image in C-space (C-point). <p> A finite number of obstacles in W-space produce a finite set of virtual obstacles in C-space.

A simpler approach (used by our simulation as described in [7]) is to employ a variation of the Bug1 <ref> [6] </ref> algorithm. of change of each angle is 2, making C-space a square. The dark areas represent the virtual obstacles. The C-space correspondence to a two-torus means that all four corners of the square are identified (i.e. correspond to the same point). <p> Success in this area will also mean applicability of the approach to a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. Computer algorithms for motion planning with incomplete information are available (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>). Experiments with human subjects operating in an unknown maze [4, 5] suggest that humans might be able to handle this case as well.

In the joint-mode, the algorithm computes a unit vector which describes the straight-line direction from current configuration to a specified target configuration. <p> The boundaries of virtual obstacles are known to consist of simple closed curves [6].
