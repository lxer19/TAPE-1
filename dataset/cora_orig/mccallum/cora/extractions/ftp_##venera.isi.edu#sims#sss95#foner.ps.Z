Title: Clustering and Information Sharing in an Ecology of Cooperating Agents for a variety of applications,
Author: Leonard N Foner peers. 
Note: Software agents have become increasingly popular  Parts of the ideas above have been implemented, but many of them are speculative at this point, and feed back is actively encouraged.

Abstract: We investigate here some approaches and applications which will serve as a testbed for evaluating solutions to the above problems. These approaches involve clustering agents into clumps or niches that need only local knowledge; this work hence has relevance in the fields of learning, knowledge sharing, and distributed AI.

Reference-contexts: In addition, a semantic-net approach offers promise of more interesting distance metrics between ads than simple similarity of keywords, such as via antonymical relationshipsfor example, we could use WordNet [Miller 93], which specifies a semantic net of common words, with help from part-of-speech tagging <ref> [Cutting et al 92] </ref>, to find, e.g., negations such as I do want to live in an apartment. 2.2.2 The clump space We turn now to actually using a distance metric to cause ads to agglutinate in clump space.
