Reference-contexts: Digital library data objects have different kinds of media and the different media have different methods. For example, lossy compression techniques associ-ated with an image data object will be applied to the image to reduce the size without sacrific ing information about the image <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We discussed different resolution images above. We now discuss adaptability of image and video transmission to varying bandwidth availability. Image Transmission: Images can be stored, manipulated and viewed in multiple resolutions. They are amenable to losing data without losing the semantics of the image <ref> [1] </ref>. Images are rich in semantic content and careful manipulation will result in an image so that no visible information is lost. Lossy compression techniques result in a smaller size and lower quality image. They exploit the fact that human eyes are more sensitive to luminance than chrominance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Digital libraries provide online access to a vast number of distributed text and multimedia information sources in an integrated manner <ref> [2] </ref>. Digital library data include texts, figures, photographs, sound, video, films, slides, etc. The size of the data and information repositories available is enormous.

Reference-contexts: The raw data, physical organization of the data, and the digital library databases constitute this layer <ref> [3] </ref>. This layer is the same as that of a digital library for static users. 3.2 Layer 2: Metadata Storage Digital libraries use metadata as a form of representing structure, organization and content of data [5]. <p> This architecture is part of a system under development in Raidlab at Purdue University in a research effort to address the impact of communications on digital library services <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, many users of digital library services will only occasionally be con nected to a network. 2. Weak Connectivity: Wireless networks deliver much lower bandwidth than wired networks and have higher error rates <ref> [4] </ref>. While wired network bandwidth of 155 Mpbs for ATM networks has been achieved, wireless communication have only 2 Mpbs for radio communication, 9-14 Kpbs for cellular telephony [4], and 250 Kpbs-2 Mpbs for wireless LANs. <p> Weak Connectivity: Wireless networks deliver much lower bandwidth than wired networks and have higher error rates <ref> [4] </ref>. While wired network bandwidth of 155 Mpbs for ATM networks has been achieved, wireless communication have only 2 Mpbs for radio communication, 9-14 Kpbs for cellular telephony [4], and 250 Kpbs-2 Mpbs for wireless LANs. Since the bandwidth is divided among users in a geographical region, the deliverable bandwidth per user is even lower [10]. 3.

Reference-contexts: This layer is the same as that of a digital library for static users. 3.2 Layer 2: Metadata Storage Digital libraries use metadata as a form of representing structure, organization and content of data <ref> [5] </ref>. Metadata typically is of a much smaller size and hence less complex to process, retrieve and transmit in a mobile environment. Weak connectivity constrains the amount of data that can be retrieved by a mobile user.

Reference-contexts: Wireless bandwidth used by a mobile host to communicate with the static host is a scarce resource and the data transmission over the air is currently monetarily expensive <ref> [6] </ref>. Mobile computers have to conserve energy and their compact design leads to small screen displays and limited storage capabilities. They are susceptible to disconnections due to out of range location, weather conditions, and loss of battery power.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this paper is to clearly identify the implications of the possibility of accessing digital libraries through wireless networks. 2 Impact of Mobility on Digital Library Services The mobile computing architecture we visualize has two distinct types of hosts: mobile and fixed hosts <ref> [7] </ref>. The fixed hosts, called base stations or static servers or hosts are augmented with a wireless interface to communicate with mobile hosts. Each mobile host can directly communicate with one base station, the one covering the geographical area in which the mobile host moves.

Reference-contexts: They reduce the bits used for chrominance and retain the bits used for luminance so that it is hard for the human eye to perceive the difference between a compressed and uncompressed image. Depending on the semantics of the image, we can achieve up to 100:1 <ref> [8] </ref> compression ratio. An image can have different levels of compression. The adaptability module has the responsibility of deciding what level of compression to use for the current bandwidth. The mobile user receives images at the same rate irrespective of the varying bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Video Transmission: Like images, video clippings can be viewed, stored, manipulated in multiple resolutions, color schemes, sizes etc. Changing these parameters will result in a video file of a smaller size and hence lower the response time <ref> [9] </ref>: * Color Depth: A greyscale video clipping requires lesser bits than the corresponding color video clipping * Frame Size: Reducing the video frame size by half results in a 50% reduction in bits needed to code the video frame * Frame Resolution: Resolution can be lowered according to the resolution <p> We illustrate the function of the cache in the mobile host by using an example of retrieving digital library video data. The video-on-demand architecture <ref> [9] </ref> has been adapted to a mobile computing environment. The static server sends chunks of the video file to the user; the user displays the data that has been received while the rest of the video data is being transmitted simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Since the bandwidth is divided among users in a geographical region, the deliverable bandwidth per user is even lower <ref> [10] </ref>. 3. Asymmetric Capabilities of Server and Client: * Communication: Most of the static servers have powerful broadcast transmitters while mobile clients have little transmission ca pability. * Computing power: The static servers have typically more computing power than the mobile clients. <p> Input from the user's profile is incorporated to resolve ambiguities in the query and make it complete. Such an approach is feasible because of the specific domain mobile users' queries will be addressed to. For example, a user might want to find out about a new CD of music <ref> [10] </ref>. Information from previous queries on music of interest will enable the system to answer the query efficiently. The profile will also include information about the user's career, work, and since the users are mobile, reason for travel and destination. <p> The two principal layers are the caching layer and the graphical user interface layer. 4.1 Layer 5: Graphical User Interface The mobile hosts have limited computing power, memory and screen size as a result of the requirement to keep their size and weight small <ref> [10] </ref>. The limited display size of about 10 square inches imposes a restriction on the amount of data that can be displayed to the user at a given time.
