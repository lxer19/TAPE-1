Abstract: A key lesson learned from economic and game theory research is that negotiation protocols have substantial, rippling effects on the overall nature of the system. online auctions are increasingly popular negotiation protocols for software agents (and humans) to compete on the prices of goods and services. This paper takes a critical look at these competitive protocols in retail markets from economic, game theoretic, and business perspectives. Our analysis suggests that online auction protocols are, in fact, less efficient and more hostile than would be expected (or desired) in retail markets. Furthermore, we identify the importance of customer satisfaction and propose more cooperative multi-agent decision analysis tools (e..g, Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) and negotiation protocols (e.g., Distributed Constraint Satisfaction) as promising techniques to support it.

Reference-contexts: 1. Retail Market Negotiations Todays mass market retail is largely defined as monopolistic competition <ref> [1] </ref>. Whenever improved or unique products (e.g., faster computers or Tamagotchis) create a significant demand, similar products will eventually come to market that are very close (but not perfect) substitutes for the original. This new supply dismantles the monopoly and dissipates the demand. <p> Competitive negotiations can be described as the decision-making process of resolving a conflict involving two or more parties over a single mutually exclusive goal. The Economics literature describes this more specifically as the effects on market price of a limited resource given its supply and demand among self-interested parties <ref> [1] </ref>. The Game Theory literature describes this situation as a zerosum game where as the value along a single dimension shifts in either direction, one side is better off and the other is worse off [4]. <p> However, first-degree price discrimination is tenuous in markets with monopolistic competition <ref> [1] </ref>. This suggests that DCSP techniques are not overly cooperative for bilateral, cooperative negotiations in retail markets. 4 . Conclusion and Future Work This paper analyzed several electronic markets and their corresponding negotiation protocols from economic, game theoretic, and business perspectives.

Reference-contexts: Thus, todays retail can be described as a competition amongst merchants for consumers patronage. The relationship that a merchant wishes to have with its customers, however, is not competitive. On the contrary, todays retail merchants desire highly cooperative, long-term relationships with their customers to maximize customer satisfaction <ref> [2] </ref>. This goal of maximizing customer satisfaction is to increase the probability of repeat purchases and new customers through positive reputation. <p> As explained, online auctions are unnecessarily hostile to customers and offer no long-term benefits to merchants. Essentially, they pit merchant against customer in price tug-of-wars. This is not the type of relationship merchants prefer to have with their customers <ref> [2] </ref>. Unlike most classified ad and commodity markets (e.g., stock markets), merchants often care less about profit on any given transaction and care more about long-term profitability. This ties directly to customer satisfaction and long-term customer relationships.

Reference-contexts: todays physical-world retail? We are already seeing online businesses that challenge the status quo (e.g., Amazon.com) and technologies that are dramatically changing the face of retail commerce e.g., agent systems that reduce transaction costs for both merchants and consumers and create personalized and community-based experiences to help merchants increase sales <ref> [3] </ref>. H ow ev e r, c e r ta in fu nd am e nta l ec o nom ic characteristics of retail will likely n ot change. For example, future online retail markets will still have consumers who wish to satisfy their individual needs with well-matched merchant offerings. <p> More recently, software agents have been taught competitive negotiation skills (e.g., auctioneering and auction bidding skills) to help automate consumer-to-consumer, business-to-business, and retail shopping over the Internet <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 . 1 . Classified Ad Negotiations Kasbah [7, 8] is a Web-based multi-agent classified ad system where users create buying agents and selling agents to help transact goods. These agents automate much of the buyers and sellers brokering and negotiations.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we explore cooperative negotiation protocols that show more promise in accurately modeling the economic relationships in retail electronic commerce. 2. Competitive Negotiations Negotiation is a form of decision-making where two or more parties jointly search a space of possible solutions with the goal of reaching a consensus <ref> [4] </ref>. Economics and Game Theory describe such an interaction in terms of protocols and strategies. The protocols of a negotiation comprise the rules (i.e., legitimate actions) of the game. <p> The Game Theory literature describes this situation as a zerosum game where as the value along a single dimension shifts in either direction, one side is better off and the other is worse off <ref> [4] </ref>. The benefit of dynamically negotiating a price for a product instead of fixing it is that it relieves the seller from needing to determine the value of the good a priori. Rather, this burden is pushed into the marketplace itself. <p> The game theory literature describes cooperative negotiation as a nonzero-sum game where as the values along multiple dimensions shift in different directions, it is possible for all parties to be better off <ref> [4] </ref>. In essence, cooperative negotiation is a win-win type of negotiation. This is in stark contrast to competitive negotiation which is a win-lose type of negotiation. 5 c . . . c c compete with one another for merchant offerings.

Reference-contexts: Expected utilities are utilities that consider probabilistic outcomes and events such as an opponents future reaction to a players action. Oftentimes, a utility function only reflects a players self-interest. In other cases, it encompasses desirable social welfare or global performance goals such as systemwide equilibria <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Competitive negotiations can be described as the decision-making process of resolving a conflict involving two or more parties over a single mutually exclusive goal.
