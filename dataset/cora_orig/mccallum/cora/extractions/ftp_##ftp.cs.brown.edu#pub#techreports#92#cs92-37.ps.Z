Reference-contexts: The greedy approximation algorithm in <ref> [6] </ref> gives a better cost bound using more medians; the right-hand sides of (1) and (2) are replaced by (1 + 1=*)D and (1 + *)s (ln n + 1), respectively. <p> For approximation algorithms for the s-center problem, we refer the readers to [1,2,3] 1 The transformation technique used for the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 is funda-mentally different from those of randomized and deterministic rounding [7,8] and the methods proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. The previous techniques never set variables with zero values in the fractional solution to 1. Our algorithms, on the other hand, may set 0-valued variables to 1. This departure from previous methods is crucial for the success of our algorithms. We show in [6] that the number of medians cannot <p> [7,8] and the methods proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. The previous techniques never set variables with zero values in the fractional solution to 1. Our algorithms, on the other hand, may set 0-valued variables to 1. This departure from previous methods is crucial for the success of our algorithms. We show in [6] that the number of medians cannot be approximated within better than logarithmic factors without violating the bound on total distance, unless the dominating set and set cover problems can be approximated within better than logarithmic factors. 2 Metric Spaces In this section we give the proof of Theorem 1.
