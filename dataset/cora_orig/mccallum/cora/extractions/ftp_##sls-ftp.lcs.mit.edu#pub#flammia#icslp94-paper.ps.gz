Abstract: Voyager is a spoken language system that acts as a tourist guide for a limited geographical area. It was initially developed for English and subsequently for Japanese. The kernel of the system is now independent of the language used. In this paper we present the development of the Italian version of this system, stressing which parameters of the system are language independent and which ones are language specific. We present the three essential stages of the development of the Italian voyager. The first stage was data collection: 2367 read and spontaneous sentences have been recorded by 49 native speakers. In the second stage, we defined a set of acoustic models and a lexicon of pronunciations for the summit speech recognizer. The third stage consisted of developing grammar rules and constraints for the semantic parser tina. The paper presents results in speech recognition, natural language and spoken language system evaluations on an independent test set of 252 sentences spoken by 7 speakers.

Reference-contexts: The system was initially developed for American English in 1989 <ref> [1] </ref>. Over the past few years, we have become interested in developing multilingual systems. Our objective is to design human-computer interfaces such that information can be accessed using several different spoken languages. In 1992 we extended voyager to handle Japanese [2].

The kernel of the system was redesigned to be as language independent as possible, with language dependent components isolated in external parameters. In order to assess and further develop the multilingual capabilities of the system, we are porting the system to other Asian and European languages.

Reference-contexts: The first component is summit, a segment- based phonemic continuous speech recognizer that takes as input the acoustic signal. Summit outputs either the top N best-scoring sentence hypotheses or a network of word hypotheses <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> This reduced vowel is co-articulated with the preceding palatal nasal <ref> [3] </ref> and the following alveolar stop closure [d], both with a front place of articulation.

Reference-contexts: The second component is tina, a probabilistic parser that selects the first of the N sentence hypotheses that is syntactically and semantically plausible according to a language specific grammar, and produces a language independent semantic frame encoding the meaning of the sentence <ref> [4] </ref>. Language specific grammars are encoded by: (1) a set of context-free rules, and (2) syntactic feature constraints.

For the sake of brevity, we will not discuss in this paper issues regarding discourse references and language generation in Italian. 3 Data Collection To date, 2367 sentences have been recorded and transcribed orthographically from 49 native speakers from different Italian regions.

Reference-contexts: In the second scenario the subject was free to ask questions within the domain of voyager. The average number of sentences per scenario was 10. 4 Speech Recognition Table 1 lists the Italian phonemes <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. Vowels can be stressed (longer duration), unstressed, or reduced (shorter duration, centralized). Word final unstressed vowels are generally reduced, and sometimes deleted.

To simplify semantic processing, the grammar was applied deterministically, the parse tree had to account for all the words in the sentence, and only the first successful parse tree was returned from the parsing procedure.

Reference-contexts: Often much of an utterance is covered by the current grammar rules, and robust parsing techniques could produce an answer to an utterance when full linguistic analysis fails, along the lines of the work done for our American-English airline reservation system <ref> [11] </ref>.
