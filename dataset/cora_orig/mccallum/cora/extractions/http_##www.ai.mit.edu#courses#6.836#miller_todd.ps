Abstract: In the pantheon of evolutionary forces, the optimizing Apollonian powers of natural selection are generally assumed to dominate the dark Dionysian dynamics of sexual selection. But this need not be the case, particularly with a class of selective mating mechanisms called `directional mate preferences' (Kirkpatrick, 1987). In previous simulation research, we showed that nondirectional assortative mating preferences could cause populations to spontaneously split apart into separate species (Todd & Miller, 1991). In this paper, we show that directional mate preferences can cause populations to wander capriciously through phenotype space, under a strange form of runaway sexual selection, with or without the influence of natural selection pressures. When directional mate preferences are free to evolve, they do not always evolve to point in the direction of natural-selective peaks. Sexual selection can thus take on a life of its own, such that mate preferences within a species become a distinct and important part of the environment to which the species' phenotypes adapt. These results suggest a broader conception of `adaptive behavior', in which attracting potential mates becomes as important as finding food and avoiding predators. We present a framework for simulating a wide range of directional and non-directional mate preferences, and discuss some practical and scientific applications of simu lating sexual selection.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we have focused more on arbitrary preferences, but there is strong evidence from biology that many mate preferences do pick out viability indicators <ref> (e.g. Hamilton & Zuk, 1982) </ref>. The ability of mate preferences to respond to viability indicators may be particularly useful and important when the mapping from phenotype to natural-selective fitness is noisy. <p> Among many bird species for example, most male adults are healthy enough to survive, so there is little variance in their natural-selective fitness. But only a few are healthy enough to produce brilliant, sexually-preferred plumage <ref> (Hamilton & Zuk, 1982) </ref>, so there is large variance in their sexual-selective fitness. Since sexual-selective fitness is highly correlated with natural-selective fitness in such cases, the former can be thought of as magnifying the latter.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we go one step further to explore a new class of mate choice mechanisms called `directional mate preferences' <ref> (Kirkpatrick, 1987) </ref>. With nondirectional mate preferences, one's ideal mate just has some degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) to one's own phenotype. With directional mate preferences, one's ideal mate is some distance away in phenotype space in a particular phenotypic direction (e.g. is much bigger, smarter, or richer than oneself). <p> These directional preferences can be plotted as mate preference vectors in phenotype space, originating at the SRP and ending at the center of the POM function. Directional preferences are of interest primarily because they can facilitate 3 runaway sexual selection <ref> (Kirkpatrick, 1987) </ref>, and because they seem quite common in nature. Many species probably use a combination of non-directional preferences for some phenotypic dimensions and directional preferences for others. We focus here on the effects of directional preferences.

Reference-contexts: Even when there are clearly defined natural-selective peaks in an adaptive landscape, a population subject to sexual selection with directional mate preferences will still wander through the landscape, often climbing adaptive peaks but seldom staying there for long. These results provide more evidence for our previous suggestions <ref> (Todd & Miller, 1991) </ref> that apparently trivial changes in the psychological mechanisms of mate choice can have substantial effects on the evolutionary dynamics of an entire population. This paper progresses from historical background to simulations methods, simulation results, possible applications, and finally conclusions. <p> And as we will show, directional mate preferences can often evolve to be quite arbitrary, driving populations away from natural-selective peaks. 3 Simulation Methods To explore the intricacies of sexual selection with directional mate preferences, we modified our previous genetic algorithm method of simulating sexual selection with nondirectional preferences <ref> (Todd & Miller, 1991) </ref>. Our general framework for simulating mate preferences is cast within the context of an n-dimensional phenotype space. Every individual in our evolving populations has a particular phenotype, which can be represented as a particular location in that space. <p> Given a particular SRP, the peak of the cone-shaped POM function can be determined in two general ways. First, the POM peak could simply be centered on the SRP itself to yield non-directional preferences. We showed in previous work <ref> (Todd & Miller, 1991) </ref> that such non-directional assortative mate preferences can result in spontaneous sympatric speciation. Second, individuals can have directional preferences, in which the POM function is offset some distance away from the SRP in a particular direction, with both distance and direction parameters genetically specified. <p> So sexual selection could keep a population evolving along even when the objective variance in natural-selective fitness is rather small. Finally, sexual selection can allow spontaneous sympatric speciation <ref> (see Todd & Miller, 1991) </ref>. This sort of speciation may allow more efficient niche exploration and exploitation in complex adaptive landscapes with multiple peaks. If a population does not have the ability to spontaneously spe-ciate, then it must remain fairly coherent and climb only one adaptive peak at a time.
