Abstract: This paper presents a background traffic model, (M; P; S), designed for use in wide-area packet-switched network simulators. The approach is to model the aggregate traffic generated by a large campus network and then partition the aggregate traffic into substreams, one for each campus-level destination in the backbone network. We use packet traces collected at the network exchange point of a large campus network and the global Internet to motivate our model design and demonstrate that our approach generates realistic results. Key features of the proposed model include: (1) efficiency the generation of only a single long-range dependent stream is required for each campus network, (2) simplicity the statistical properties (i.e., arrival density and correlation structure) of the sample path are controlled by a few parameters, and (3) accuracy the self-similarity and arrival distribution for both the aggregate traffic and its component substreams accurately reproduce those of the empirical traffic trace. The results presented in this paper can be used to develop WAN background load models and traffic generators, contribute to understanding the fractal behavior of Internet backbone network utilization, and provide a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of existing traffic models.

The advantage to a FGN process is that the degree of self-similarity can be expressed solely by the Hurst parameter.

Reference-contexts: Table 2 gives the network masks used to partition the aggregate stream into fourteen campus substreams based on destination IP address (for a review of this area, refer to <ref> [3] </ref>). The table gives the percentage of packets that each substream contributes to the aggregate stream for the 2AM, 3PM and 9PM traces.

Reference-contexts: The time-dependent properties of the UVAnet streams are shown in is calculated for all lag k as follows: r (k) = i=1 (X i X)(X i+k X) suggesting that the streams have long-range dependencies (for a review of this subject, see <ref> [4] </ref>). The important property of an arrival process with long-range dependencies is that the arrival burstiness is similar, independent of the time scale in which it is viewed (so-called self-similar processes). <p> Efficiency is crucial since a large simulation must generate potentially millions of packets per second; thus, exact self-similar processes based on fractional auto-regressive integrated moving averages (F-ARIMA) [1], alternating renewal processes [9] and M/G/1 queues <ref> [4] </ref> are precluded because of their computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: We develop a novel background traffic model that is efficient enough for use in a regional or national Internet backbone network simulation, while retaining a high degree of accuracy. One common background traffic generation approach is to aggregate a number of individual sources (e.g., using tcplib <ref> [5] </ref>) until the desired background load in the network is achieved. Although the application-level aggregation technique is accurate, it is not efficient enough to scale to large backbone network simulations, especially those designed to evaluate complex communication patterns such as reliable multicast.

Reference-contexts: These results are consistent with studies showing the self-similarity of LAN traffic which have estimated the Hurst parameter as high as 0:82 [9].

Reference-contexts: H varies between 0:5 and 1, where a larger value indicates a higher degree of self-similarity. For a short-range dependent process, such as the Poisson-based models in <ref> [7, 13] </ref>, the Hurst parameter will be approximately 0:5; thus, by (4), the correlation of a Poisson process will fall off as 1=m where m is called the aggregation level.
