Abstract: Derivative instruments are financial engineering tools. They are linked to underlying financial instruments and are often better suited to manage exposure to risk. A number of tools exist for example for the management of interest rate risks. The optimal choice of a specific instrument depends on a variety of factors. One crucial factor is the client's estimate of interest rate developments in comparison to implied forward rates. The goal of the presented project is to develop practical computer-based tools to assist market participants in assessing rate developments. In the area of interest rate developments, we will analyze and predict rates using modern nonlinear models, such as multilayer perceptrons. Unlike other approaches with nonlinear models, this consists of several steps: a model-selection step, based on an estimate of mean prediction error, including well known statistical methods for time series prediction (ARMA); a step to estimate the predictive distribution, and a step to evaluate the predictive distribution in order to establish standard errors and confidence intervals. Predictive distributions are estimated by less assumptive approaches, i. e., bootstrap methods. Another important aspect is user interaction. We will integrate assisting tools into existing software at the trade center of the Bankgesellschaft to facilitate its use. Model selection and estimation is done automatically while parameters depending on the actual risk management strategy, i. e., the width of confidence intervals or the needed quantile, are chosen by the user.

Reference-contexts: The prognosis must be made on the basis of: 1. current prices, 2. historical prices, 3. market expectations. 2 Financial Engineering Tools to Manage Interest Rate Risks Brian Eales from London Guildhall University nicely describes what financial engineering and interest rate management stand for <ref> [1] </ref>: Financial risk management can be interpreted as: the controlling of the possibility or chance of suffering a monetary loss. In financial circles, the activity of controlling such risk is normally referred as hedging. The common instruments for managing interest rate risks are Swaps, Options, Forwards and Futures. <p> are FRA's or Forward Rate Agreements? FRA's are in essence contracts in which the parties agree to pay the present value of the difference between a contract rate and the market rate of interest holding at a specific date in the future, multiplied by the notional principal specified in contract. <ref> [1] </ref> FRA's are traded as OTC (over the counter) products between banks or between a customer and a bank. In the case of an 1 fi 4 FRA, the buyer agrees notionally to borrow in one month for three month whereas the seller agrees notionally to lend.

Reference-contexts: It can thus be used for model selection. This step can be improved if the partitioning of the data into training and test set is done systematically, e. g., using cross-validation <ref> [2] </ref>.

We will follow a bootstrap approach to estimate the predictive distribution or some statistic of the predictive distribution <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.2 Analysis We will begin with a linear analysis to derive some basic characteristics of the series. Figure 2 shows autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots of the differenced series that can help to find appropriate AR (Auto Regressive) and AR (I)MA (Auto Regressive (Integrated) Moving Average) models [6]. <p> The evaluation of MLP's in terms of standard error or confidence intervals is beginning to develop. A promising approach in the direction of estimating the full parameter distribution, that goes beyond point estimates, is the bootstrap <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Using an indirect prediction method for the three-month LIBOR series, we achieved very encouraging results, which can already be used in our trader support system. Further research will focus on non-stationary aspects of a time series. A combination of models, e. g., mixtures of experts <ref> [3] </ref>, may then be able to analyze different segments of a time series.

Reference-contexts: The input is a straightforward time delay coordinate embedding <ref> [5] </ref>; one output unit provides a direct prediction. Independent parts of the data set are cross-validated to determine stop-training criteria and for model selection in the class of one-hidden-layer MLP's.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 shows autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots of the differenced series that can help to find appropriate AR (Auto Regressive) and AR (I)MA (Auto Regressive (Integrated) Moving Average) models <ref> [6] </ref>. The confidence levels show no significant correlation values. Nevertheless, an ARIMA (1,1,1) model was estimated and used for prediction. Often, the best prediction is the so called random walk. In this case, any attempt to exploit past values of a series to improve a forecast will fail.
