Reference-contexts: The function compute_chi_angle computes the current angle at a bond in the sidechain. The difference between this and the rotamer angle is used to initialize the chromosome. 3.3 Genetic Algorithm STALK uses the PGAPack <ref> [Le95a, Le95b] </ref> a general-purpose, data-structure-neutral, parallel genetic algorithm library. Each string in the GA population represents a potential minimizer of the energy function. Each string has six parameters. The first three parameters represent the x-, y- and z-translations of the ligand.

Reference-contexts: The visualization component is optional. 2 Running a Job In this document we assume you have already compiled and linked stalk.ga (and stalk.cave if you intend to use the visualization program). Details on the compilation process and file directory structure are given in the STALK Programmers Guide <ref> [LeFaHaReWaSt95] </ref>. Currently stalk.ga can be executed on an IBM RS/6000 (including the IBM SP parallel computer), Sun SparcStation, and SGI workstation. The program is written in standard Fortran and should run on most machines if a version of MPI and the PGAPack GA library are available. See [LeFaHaReWaSt95] for more details. <p> STALK Programmers Guide <ref> [LeFaHaReWaSt95] </ref>.

The program is written in standard Fortran and should run on most machines if a version of MPI and the PGAPack GA library are available. See [LeFaHaReWaSt95] for more details. Currently, stalk.cave runs only on SGI workstations. 2.1 Running without Visualization The docking program stalk.ga is run via the Perl script bin/rstalk.pl. This has the advantage that the script sets a number of default values and handles any machine-specific setup needed.

Reference-contexts: A rotamer is a set of up to four angle values that uniquely specify the position of the sidechain. See <ref> [PoRi87] </ref> for a full description. These angles are measured according to the standard convention for defining dihedral angles as given in [Ri81]. When rotamer initialization is performed, first a random rotamer is chosen for the particular type of sidechain being considered.

Several rotamers can be specified in the input file, along with the probability that each will be chosen for initialization.
