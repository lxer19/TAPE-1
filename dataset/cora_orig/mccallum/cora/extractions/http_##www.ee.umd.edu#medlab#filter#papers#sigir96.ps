Abstract: In this paper we describe an evaluation methodology for cross-language text filtering systems which exploits existing test collections that were designed for monolingual evaluations. Our methodology, based on normative relevance assessments by expert users, is well suited for comparing the effect of different cross-language mapping techniques on filtering accuracy. By measuring the degradation introduced by the use of existing test collections, we are able to qualify the broader applicability of our results and to quantify the improvement in evaluation accuracy that would result from development of a test collection tailored to the evaluation of multilingual text filtering systems. From our experiments we conclude that the additional investment required to produce a truly multilingual test collection would be well justified because evaluation of multilingual text filtering techniques appears to be both practical and productive.

Our approach is based on the ranked output paradigm in which the text filtering system seeks to rank order newly arrived documents with the most useful documents near the top of the list.

Reference-contexts: based our work on a technique developed by Dumais for monolingual text filtering in which Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is used to develop relatively short feature vectors that describe the relevant training documents, and the mean of the relevant documents' feature vectors is used as the "profile" (information need representation) <ref> [2] </ref>. LSI feature vectors describing newly arrived documents are then used to rank order the newly arrived documents in order of decreasing similarity with the profile. We use the cosine similarity measure because it emphasizes content similarity while suppressing the effect of document length variations.

Reference-contexts: Two of the cross-language mapping techniques we are evaluating are motivated by earlier work on multilingual text retrieval, a topic we have also surveyed <ref> [3] </ref>. The most obvious is to pass every document through an automatic machine translation system. In multilingual text retrieval it is the "query" (the information need specification) which is most often translated.

Reference-contexts: In Latent Semantic Coindexing, bilingual or multilingual documents are prepared by adjoining versions of the same document in different languages. LSI is then trained on that document collection to find a feature vector mapping which accepts documents from any of the languages <ref> [4] </ref>. It is our interest in this technique which led us to choose the LSI-mean technique as our standard text filtering method. Other approaches to multilingual text filtering are possible as well, and we have used the same methodology to evaluate a third technique which we call Vector Translation.

Reference-contexts: The quality of a rank ordering is often evaluated using "precision" at one or more values of "recall" and that is the technique we have adopted <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Table 4 shows results for two cross-language text filtering techniques, Latent Semantic Coindexing (LSC) and Text Translation (TT), and a baseline run (labeled "None") in which we used no cross-language mapping technique at all. These results are described in detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper we will limit our comments to those which address fundamental evaluation issues. The most significant observation that we can draw from our experiments is that multilingual text filtering is practical and that the presently available corpora are adequate to demonstrate that fact. <p> In every case the precision achieved by random selection would have been below 0.01 at any value of recall. Additional details on this point are presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. Another interesting observation is that the results without cross-language mapping exhibit a surprising amount of variation. We attribute this effect to the existence of words which are common to Spanish and English that are useful for recognizing documents that are relevant to some topics.
