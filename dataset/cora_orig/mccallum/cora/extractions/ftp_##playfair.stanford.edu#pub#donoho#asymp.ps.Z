Title: Wavelet Shrinkage: Asymptopia?

Abstract: Considerable effort has been directed recently to develop asymptotically minimax methods in problems of recovering infinite-dimensional objects (curves, densities, spectral densities, images) from noisy data. A rich and complex body of work has evolved, with nearly- or exactly- minimax estimators being obtained for a variety of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the results have often not been translated into practice, for a variety of reasons sometimes, similarity to known methods, sometimes, computational intractability, and sometimes, lack of spatial adaptivity. We discuss a method for curve estimation based on n noisy data; one translates the empirical wavelet coefficients towards the origin by an amount method is different from methods in common use today, is computationally practical, and is spatially adaptive; thus it avoids a number of previous objections to minimax estimators. At the same time, the method is nearly minimax for a wide variety of loss functions - e.g. pointwise error, global error measured in L p norms, pointwise and global error in estimation of derivatives and for a wide range of smoothness classes, including standard Holder classes, Sobolev classes, and Bounded Variation. This is a much broader near-optimality than anything previously proposed in the minimax literature. Finally, the theory underlying the method is interesting, as it exploits a correspondence between statistical questions and questions of optimal recovery and information-based complexity.

Reference-contexts: for this. 2.4.1 Philosophical Common-sense The minimax paradigm designs estimators on the assumption that certain smoothness conditions hold; yet we never know such smoothness to be the case. (There are even results showing that it is impossible to tell whether or not a function belongs to some W p m <ref> [13] </ref>). There is therefore a disconnect between the suppositions of the Minimax Paradigm and the actual situation when one is confronted with real data. This makes the applicability of the results a priori doubtful.

Reference-contexts: Proper deployment of this tool allows us to avoid many of the difficulties, hesitations, qualifications, and limitations in the existing statistical literature. 3.1 The Method For simplicity, we focus on the nonparametric regression model (3) and a proposal of [22]; similar results are possible in the density estimation model <ref> [39] </ref>. We suppose that we have n = 2 J+1 data of the form (3) and that is known. 1. Take the n given numbers and apply an empirical wavelet transform W n n , obtaining n empirical wavelet coefficients (w j;k ). <p> The proof is parallel to the proof of Theorem 4. 6.1.5 Density Estimation Johnstone, Kerkyacharian and Picard have shown that wavelet thresholding may be used to obtain near-optimal rates in density estimation <ref> [39] </ref>. Suppose that X 1 ; : : : ; X n are i.i.d. f , where f is an unknown density supported in [0; 1]. <p> Let W j;k = n 1 i=1 where j;k is again the appropriate wavelet basis function. 25 Define thresholds t j = 0;, j &lt; j 0 , and t j = A p The thresholded wavelet series estimator of <ref> [39] </ref> is ^ f + J X X t j (W j;k ) j;k : For this estimator, [39] gives optimal rate results which are the exact parallel of the results we get above in Theorem 4. <p> j;k is again the appropriate wavelet basis function. 25 Define thresholds t j = 0;, j &lt; j 0 , and t j = A p The thresholded wavelet series estimator of <ref> [39] </ref> is ^ f + J X X t j (W j;k ) j;k : For this estimator, [39] gives optimal rate results which are the exact parallel of the results we get above in Theorem 4. This of course is no accident, as the problems are known to be closely connected. <p> This of course is no accident, as the problems are known to be closely connected. We mention here a simple corollary of the results of the present paper, which makes an interesting comparison to <ref> [39] </ref>. Suppose we let I n denote the collection of wavelet coefficients up to level J where J = blog 2 (n) 1c. <p> This lower bound shows that ^ f fl n is within logarithmic factors of minimax; and the upper bound shows that ^ f + n outperforms ^ f fl n because, loosely speaking, it is able convert log (n)-type bounds to q bounds. The proofs of <ref> [39] </ref> are entirely different from the proofs given here. 6.2 Insights We collect here a few insights generated by the wavelet thresholding work. 26 6.2.1 Minimaxity and Spatial Adaptivity The implicit position of the "Spatial Adaptivity" community that minimax theory leads to spatially non-adaptive methods is no longer tenable. [20] shows

Reference-contexts: (35), we again have that soft-thresholding is nearly minimax, simultaneously over a wide range of a-priori classes and choices of loss. 5.3 Application to the Sequence Model We now translate the results on optimal recovery into results on statistical estimation. 5.3.1 Upper Bounds The basic idea is the following fact <ref> [43] </ref>: Let (z I ) be i.i.d.

Here, precise optimality rules out a broad approximate optimality. There is also a parallel with the theory of robustness.
