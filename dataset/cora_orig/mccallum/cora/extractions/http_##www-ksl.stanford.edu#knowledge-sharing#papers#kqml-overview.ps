Abstract: We describe a language and protocol intended to support interoperability among intelligent agents in a distributed application. Examples of applications envisioned include intelligent multi-agent design systems as well as intelligent planning, scheduling and replanning agents supporting distributed transportation planning and scheduling applications. The language, KQML for Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language, is part of a larger DARPA-sponsored Knowledge Sharing effort focused on developing techniques and tools to promote the sharing on knowledge in intelligent systems. e will define the concepts which underly KQML and attempt to specify its scope and provide a model for how it will be used.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper is an overview of the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) ongoing effort under the auspicies of External Interfaces Working Group of the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort <ref> [8] </ref>. The report is intended to motivate the need for a standard language for information exchange among a collection of interacting knowledge-based agents and give an overview for KQML. 1.1 Background and Motivation We envision future large knowledge-based systems systems consisting of many dynamically interacting components. <p> Content Layer. KQML makes no commitments about the content layer. One can use it with any number of content languages, such as KRSL [3], KIF <ref> [8] </ref> or LOOM [4]. All the two intelligent agents need to do is to agree on a language to use for communication.
