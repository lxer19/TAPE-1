Title: STABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE SHIFTS OF FINITELY MANY REFINABLE FUNCTIONS  
Author: Thomas A. Hogan 
Date: 27 February 1997  
Abstract: Typical constructions of wavelets depend on the stability of the shifts of an underlying refinable function. Unfortunately, several desirable properties are not available with compactly supported orthogonal wavelets, e.g. symmetry and piecewise polynomial structure. Presently, multiwavelets seem to offer a satisfactory alternative. The study of multiwavelets involves the consideration of the properties of several (simultaneously) refinable functions. In Section 2 of this paper, we characterize stability and linear independence of the shifts of a finite refinable function set in terms of the refinement mask. Several illustrative examples are provided. The characterizations given in Section 2 actually require that the refinable functions be minimal in some sense. This notion of minimality is made clear in Section 3, where we provide sufficient conditions on the mask to ensure minimality. The conditions are shown to be also necessary under further assumptions on the refinement mask. An example is provided illustrating how the software package MAPLE can be used to investigate at least the case of two simultaneously refinable functions.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we provide a characterisation of stability and linear independence in terms of the mask. This however brings up another issue which does not appear when dealing with a single refinable function. The issue concerns the notion which de Boor, DeVore, and Ron refer to in <ref> [BDR] </ref> as length. A necessary condition for a set to have stable shifts is that be a minimally generating set. This unfortunately is not a condition which is easily characterised in terms of the mask. <p> #, where len S () := min f # : S () = S () g; S () := the L 2 -closure of S 0 (); and S 0 () := the set of all finite linear combinations of integer translates of all the 2 : The results of <ref> [BDR] </ref> imply that for any compactly supported finite set L 2 (IR) with len S () = #, the sequences in (1.1) are linearly independent for almost every ~ 2 C. <p> Lemmata For a single function 2 L 2 (IR), we refer to S () := S (fg) as the principal shift-invariant, or PSI space, generated by . This terminology is used in the first of the following results both of which can be found in <ref> [BDR] </ref>. Result 2.4. For any compactly supported finite set L 2 (IR), S () is the orthogonal sum of finitely many PSI spaces, each generated by a compactly supported function having linearly independent shifts. Result 2.5. <p> The characterization of S () given in <ref> [BDR] </ref> then implies that (=2) 2 S (). Since the shifts of are linearly independent, Result 2.5 implies that the entries of the matrix B are trigonometric polynomials. <p> The cardinality of a smallest generating set for an FSI space S is called the length of S. We write len S := min f # : S = S () g: This terminology and notation is from <ref> [BDR] </ref>. <p> However, no means for verifying this assumption by investigation of the mask were provided. In this section we give a characterization of this assumption in terms of the mask. STABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE 13 In <ref> [BDR] </ref>, finitely generated shift-invariant subspaces of L 2 (IR) were characterized as follows. For any finite L 2 (IR) and any f 2 L 2 (IR), f 2 S () if and only if b f = 2 for some 2-periodic functions t .
