Abstract: Oversampling a delta-sigma-modulated sequence, one can compute unbiased sample estimates of averages of consecutive input elements for a wide variety of inputs. We prove that these estimates are most efficient in their class (that is, variances of sample means are minimum in the class of random binary sequences g n , n = 1; : : : ; N , such that the expected values of g n are equal to the values of the corresponding inputs of delta-sigma modulation) and consistent. Delta-sigma modulation may also be described as one-dimensional error diffusion (a technique for digital halftoning). However, delta-sigma modulation is not a practical digital halftoning algorithm, because human vision averages small luminance deviations in two dimensions. We pose an open problem that invites the reader to extend our approach to the two-dimensional case for the purpose of development of a practical digital halftoning algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Delta-sigma (or sigma-delta) modulation [3, 20] is a well-known form of data transformation applied in digital signal processing and communication systems. Our paper deals with single-loop delta-sigma modulation (more sophisticated configurations are known [4, 13]). Without loss of generality, we take the range of delta-sigma modulation to be <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (linear transformations cover arbitrary ranges [fl 1 ; fl 2 ], fl 1 &lt; fl 2 ). We also assume that the values of inputs x n , n = 1; 2; : : : ; N lie within [0; 1], i.e. there is no overload. <p> we take the range of delta-sigma modulation to be <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (linear transformations cover arbitrary ranges [fl 1 ; fl 2 ], fl 1 &lt; fl 2 ). We also assume that the values of inputs x n , n = 1; 2; : : : ; N lie within [0; 1], i.e. there is no overload. This is a common and reasonable assumption [7]. <p> , n = 1; : : : ; N , by the formula q n = 2 1 sgn 0 2x n 1 + 2 i=1 ! where values of function sgn 0 () are computed as sgn 0 (z) = 1 if z 0, (2) Moreover, q n 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all n. Eq. (1) is equivalent to q n = &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 1 if x n + i=1 1 , n1 X (x i q i ) &lt; 2 (3) P n1 2 . <p> Galton [7] randomized x n by introducing an additive i.i.d. noise component into the input. For the purposes of our analysis, we randomize the coding procedure by means of introducing a random parameter ff uniformly distributed on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into Eq. (8): q n = x n + i=1 +% Parameter ff can be interpreted as a random initial value x 0 (or s 0 ) of the sequence encoded. Besides purely technical reasons for introduction of ff, we take into account the following considerations. <p> = 1; 2; : : : ; N , is a deterministic sequence, then hX n i, n = 1; 2; : : : ; N , is uniformly distributed [22] in a sufficiently general case (i.e., frequency of the values hX n i being in any range (a; b) <ref> [0; 1] </ref> goes to (b a) when N goes to infinity), so the delta-sigma modulation model with a random initial value applies to many deterministic input sequences as well. <p> We also give a simple proof of consistency of these estimates, a property that can be easily derived using the results from [2], [9], or [7]. Anastassiou <ref> [1] </ref> observed that delta-sigma modulation can be interpreted as one-dimensional error diffusion (a digital halftoning technique applied in image processing). Hein and Zakhor [14] used this relation for the purposes of halftone to continuous-tone conversion of error-diffusion coded images. <p> Then the beginning of interval I 1 will get shifted clockwise by fi and Eq. (17) will become q n = 0 if 0 62 I n , (18) Finally, we replace random variable fi with ff = 1 fi, which is also uniformly distributed on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> Indeed, from the construction above it follows that N X q n = n=1 % and inequality fi fi fi N X x n n=1 fi fi fi 5 is true for all ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> N goes to 0, we find that delta-sigma modulation guarantees consistency of sample means of consecutive outputs of the binary quantizer as estimates of averages of corresponding consecutive elements for any sequence x n , n = 1; : : : ; N , normalized so that x n 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all n. Our having randomized the coding procedure did not actually matter here, so the consistency property is present regardless of the nature of the input sequence. Note that this property is absent when common nearest-level quantization is applied instead. <p> Note that this property is absent when common nearest-level quantization is applied instead. It is straightforward to show consistency using the results of Candy [2 (Eq. (5))], Gray [9 (Corollary 1)], or Galton [7 (Corollary 6)]. Recall that x n 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and q n 2 [0; 1] for all n. <p> Note that this property is absent when common nearest-level quantization is applied instead.

Recall that x n 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and q n 2 [0; 1] for all n. From (5) and (7) it follows that q n = 1 if x n + s n1 1, (26) Equations (7) and (10), our probabilistic model, and results from [5, 22] imply that values of s n1 are often uniformly distributed on [0; 1). <p> Moreover, appropriate choices of error diffusion coefficients lead to line-by-line and column-by-column delta-sigma modulation of images <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> explains why line-by-line delta-sigma modulation of images produces characteristic corellated artifacts (zebra patterns) oriented vertically. (Analogously, column-by-column delta-sigma modulation produces horizontally oriented zebra stripes.) Error diffusion is known for similar corellated artifacts (orientation may vary), and a related discussion based on the results of spectral analysis can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. Describe two-dimensional analogs of statistical criteria met (in one dimension) by delta-sigma modulation. Design a digital halftoning algorithm meeting these new criteria and compare it to existing algorithms. 6 Acknowledgment. The authors thank Paul W.
