Title: Privacy-Enhanced Electronic Mail  
Author: Matt Bishop 
Keyword: Index Terms: certificates, cryptography, electronic mail, internet, privacy, security  
Note: Page 1 of 44  
Abstract: The security of electronic mail sent through the Internet may be described in exactly three words: there is none. The Privacy and Security Research Group has recommended implementing mechanisms designed to provide security enhancements. The first set of mechanisms provides a protocol to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication for electronic mail; the second provides a certificate-based key management infrastructure to support key distribution throughout the internet, to support the first set of mechanisms. This paper describes these mechanisms, as well as the reasons behind their selection and how these mechanisms can be used to provide some measure of security in the exchange of electronic mail.

Reference-contexts: Currently, three algorithms are specified. The DEA-1-based Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm [18] is a well-known message integrity checksum algorithm, has been examined extensively for weaknesses (see for example <ref> [1] </ref>), and appears to be quite strong; however, it is only suitable when sending a message to one recipient [30]. Hence its use is strongly discouraged for messages sent to more than one party.

Reference-contexts: The first subfield identifies the algorithm which was used to encrypt the data exchange key; the proposal requires using either the DES in electronic code book mode (indicated by DES-ECB) [17] or the DES in encrypt-decrypt-encrypt mode (indicated by DES-EDE) <ref> [2] </ref>; these were chosen because they are cryptographically very strong, can be implemented efficiently in hardware or software, and are used by standards relied upon throughout different communities. 32 The second subfield identifies the algorithm used to generate the message integrity check; this subfield must be MAC (for the DEA-1-based algorithm),

Reference-contexts: to use the public key approach may substitute their own key management scheme; however, to be compatible with other implementations, all implementations of privacy-enhanced electronic mail should support the certificate-based approach. 74 This also means that the certificate-based key management protocols may be used in contexts other than privacy-enhanced mail <ref> [4] </ref>; since its infrastructure is similar to that of X.400, it can be used to transition to that, and related, standards. More research in cryptography would aid in the maturation of this proposal.

Reference-contexts: need not be unique among all entities, but must be unique over all issuing authorities. 26 If certificate-based asymmetric key management is used, then this name is to be the issuing authori-tys Distinguished Name, written according to the rules in [24], then encoded using the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 <ref> [7] </ref> and represented using the printable encoding form described in section 3.1.3. 27 This convention was chosen because it is also used in certificates to identify issuing authorities unambiguously.

Reference-contexts: First, we look at a model of message transmittal systems, then we discuss some properties of cryptography, and finally we look at key distribution systems. 2.1. Message Handling System Model Perhaps the most useful model of mail systems is the Message Handling System Model <ref> [8] </ref> (see Figure 1). It treats the mail system as being composed of a number of connected Message Transport Agents and corresponding User Agents.

Reference-contexts: Much less widely known is the inherent lack of security in most mailing systems. Recently this has become the subject of much discussion, and some proposals have been made to enhance the security of electronic mail. The X.411 Recommendation <ref> [9] </ref>, the Message Security Protocol MSP [37], and the protocols in RFC 1113 [26], RFC 1114 [23], and RFC 1115 [27] (which we shall call the privacy-enhanced mail protocols), all attempt to address this issue.

Reference-contexts: Key Management Infrastructure If asymmetric interchange keys are used, a method for ensuring that correct public keys are made available must be provided; without such assurance, an active wiretapper could spoof the intended recipient and read the senders supposedly private message. The privacy-enhanced mail protocol suggests using X.509 <ref> [11] </ref> compliant certificates containing an entity name, a public key, an issuer name, and a digital signature created by the issuer based on its public key and the information in the certificate. This section presents the architecture for managing those certificates. 4.1.

Reference-contexts: The advent of personal computers and workstations has led many facilities to use central servers as mail hosts, so users can download their messages from their platform to the central host for transmission <ref> [12] </ref>. The above architecture fits into this scheme nicely; the privacy-enhancing software need reside only on the users platform. This was no small consideration in the design of the protocol.

The information in the header lines is used to forward the message from one message transfer agent to another using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol described in RFC-821 [33]. <p> Note that if the entire message is protected, a blank line must separate the first delimiter from the unencapsulated headers; this is required by <ref> [13] </ref>. -----BEGIN PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE BOUNDARY----- Proc-Type: 3,ENCRYPTED DEK-Info: DES-CBC,3729F9DC6300925A Sender-ID: someone@somewhere.com:: Recipient-ID: someone@somewhere.com:ptf-kmc:3 Key-Info: DES-ECB,RSA-MD2, 0F65D99570758593,AEE05B42181E5E261B301291D83DB8F1 Recipient-ID: towho@somewhere.else.com:ptf-kmc:4 Key-Info: DES-ECB,RSA-MD2, 4B425C85F819327E,0F5FACDB20FD89B9CA8636AE7E70BE74 iwf9eh8CjiF4A9OKf8ZPayOHjAZNLvWYxsGTIr8xQxfQ0uSN4GbnHHzJPXk6saOd rTLE42WxcsYZsYYZaBfbpBR3GF3nwwIY1O0s3LZTUuwsfsGeIu/v2C+dfSlq/wIE VesyVXPegFX1MSxZb5bv1J7WK9GE3G58TgwzuYNROPcF61lFq7RDWmS61ji3ZyFy DNkG/JlAeWlMgP8WpfJgVg== -----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE BOUNDARY----- Page 8 of 44 To keep privacy-enhanced mail processing as simple as possible, authentication and integ rity checks are applied only to

Reference-contexts: A Symmetric Key Distribution Mechanism Although the privacy-enhanced mail proposal recommends interchange keys be distributed using certificates, alternate key distribution methods may be used with it.

Reference-contexts: The information in the header lines is used to forward the message from one message transfer agent to another using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol described in RFC-821 [33]. Another very large network is that of UNIX 3 -based systems, which often use an alternate transfer protocol called UUCP <ref> [32] </ref> to transmit mail messages by telephone. The existence of numerous message transport agents and protocols suggests that to be used widely, a protocol to enhance security of electronic mail should not require the redesign of existing message transport protocols or message handling systems.

Reference-contexts: An alternate algorithm, the RSA-MD2 Message Digest Algorithm [27], does not suffer from this weakness and while formal analyses of it are not available, it does not appear to have any exploitable cryptographic weaknesses. Its successor, the RSA-MD4 Message Digest Algorithm <ref> [34] </ref> also appears to be quite robust and very difficult to compromise so, in the absense of evidence to the contrary, it has also been defined as an acceptable algorithm. 12 If privacy is required, the message will then be enciphered using an appropriate encryption algorithm with a data encryption key

Reference-contexts: In addition to meeting all these requirements, the RSA cryptographic algorithm <ref> [35] </ref> is also the primary algorithm recommended for use in international standards requiring (or recommending) use of a public key cryptosystem.

Reference-contexts: But if the enhancements are simply part of the body of a message, the message transport agents need know nothing about the new headers. The encapsulation mechanism chosen is similar to one widely used in electronic mail throughout the Internet <ref> [36] </ref>; that standard delimits encapsulated material between two identical delimiter lines. However, that privacy-enhanced mail allows multiple encapsulated bodies to be present either nested or sequentially introduces ambiguity, so the beginning and ending delimiters must bedifferent.
