Abstract: An experimental method for modelling and rendering liquids in motion is presented. A particle system is used to model dynamic liquid behaviour, while implicit surfaces serve as a wrapper to support realistic rendering methods. Aspects of particle-environment interaction and the use of dynamically sized particle primitives are discussed. Techniques used in the generation of implicit surfaces are also described, including environmental distortions of surface profiles and the management of surface extents to maintain constant volume. Preliminary work on multi-fluid interactions is also outlined. A custom ray tracer is used for final image generation, and several examples of the liquid modelling system are provided as an illustration of the method.

Reference-contexts: IMPLICIT SURFACE GENERATION An implicit surface is the shape formed by all three-dimensional points s which satisfy f (s) = c for some function f and scalar isosurface constant c <ref> [Bloom97] </ref>. We use particles as our implicit surface primitives: each generates a spherical potential field, the influence of which is set within some radial distance R.

Reference-contexts: A ray tracer is used to provide high-quality output. The overall approach is somewhat limited by its static nature all droplets are considered to be at rest, and there is no direct support for pouring, splashing or surface flow effects. Desbrun and Gascuel <ref> [DesGa95] </ref> have refined earlier work of Miller and Pearce [MilPe89] and Ton-nensen [Tonne91] to model viscous fluids using particle systems. They define a physical model of particle interaction, and use implicit surfaces to render the resulting forms. Their simulated materials may be cut, torn, poured and fused. <p> Clusters may also be used to prevent unwanted blending between nearby droplets (by constructing a blending graph of the kind described in <ref> [DesGa95] </ref>), although this modelling refinement has not been implemented in the current system. 4.2. Volume adjustment A fundamental property of liquids is their incompressibility. <p> Individual particles maintain their k i state throughout the simulation, and as a result only small adjustments are required on each time-step. An alternative method of implicit surface volume adjustment may be found in <ref> [Desga95] </ref>. 4.3. Distortion of potential fields The potential field generated by an individual particle is spherical in profile. Whereas the resulting isosurface shape may be acceptable for liquid droplets in free-fall, it does not give convincing results for droplets lying on a solid surface.

Reference-contexts: The attractive force supports localised coalescing of liquid droplets, while the repulsive component prevents the collapse of the fluid to a singularity <ref> [DesGa96] </ref>. The basic force model may be extended through the introduction of simple friction and mechanical damping rules to mimic more closely the properties of real liquids. <p> The inter-particle force profiles and implicit surface field functions we use at present are rather ad hoc. The modelling system is likely to benefit from a more rigorous approach of the kind described in <ref> [DesGa96] </ref>. It is envisaged that this would also assist in the development of more efficient analytical solutions to the problem of cluster volume management. Whereas the particle system already supports the modelling of multiple-fluid interactions, the iso-surface rendering extensions of section 4.4 remain to be implemented.

Reference-contexts: The method may be extended to incorporate effects due to underwater topography, diffraction and reflection around obstacles and the formation of surf in breaking waves <ref> [Peach85, FouRe86] </ref>. Wcilso et al. [WciKi98] have developed a method to model displacement behaviours in a settled body of liquid. The simulation space is decomposed uniformly into a number of cubic cells which record the location of the settled liquid within the scene.

Reference-contexts: Particle-solid interactions Our system implements a variety of particle-solid interaction behaviours. Particle-solid collisions are detected using a method similar to the ray-surface intersection tests found in ray tracing <ref> [Glass89] </ref>. If a particle impacts a surface at high velocity, reflection rules are applied to model splashing phenomena. A Gaussian random deflection is applied to the reflection vector to encourage a more natural non-deterministic behaviour. Low velocity surface impacts result in the application of sliding rules.

Reference-contexts: Static images do not provide an ideal means of illustrating the theme of this paper liquids in motion, however the results do bear a visual resemblance to dynamic liquid behaviours recorded using high speed photography. A more detailed presentation of this work can be found in <ref> [Mille98] </ref>. 6.1. Further work The work presented is currently at an early stage of development, and several modelling refinements and algorithmic optimisations still need to be addressed. The inter-particle force profiles and implicit surface field functions we use at present are rather ad hoc.

Reference-contexts: RELATED WORK Early investigations into the graphical modelling of dynamic liquid behaviour focussed upon the reproduction of surface wave effects. A common approach is to use Fourier synthesis techniques to apply animated ripples to a surface <ref> [Musgr93] </ref>, together with a renderer which uses bump or displacement mapping to convey the surface detail. The method may be extended to incorporate effects due to underwater topography, diffraction and reflection around obstacles and the formation of surf in breaking waves [Peach85, FouRe86].

Reference-contexts: Our choice of field function is not unique, and other alternatives may be used see <ref> [Wyvil86] </ref> for example. The implicit surface is rendered using a ray tracer, since we are interested in reproducing the refractive characteristics of our simulated liquid. The field function is calculated at intervals along the ray path, and its value is carefully monitored with respect to the chosen isosurface constant c.

Reference-contexts: Although the liquid surface is perturbed as a result of the object impact, true wave-like behaviour is not established. Also, there is no direct means of extending this approach to mimic realistic splashing phenomena. Yu et al. <ref> [YuJun98] </ref> describe a technique for rendering liquid droplets in contact with a flat surface. Droplet shapes are represented using spherical implicit primitives (metaballs), which are subjected to geometric distortions in order to mimic the effects of gravity.
