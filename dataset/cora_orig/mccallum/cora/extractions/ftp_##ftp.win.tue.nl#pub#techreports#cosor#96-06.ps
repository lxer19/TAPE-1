Abstract: We give an introduction to the logistic and generalized logistic distributions. We obtain exact results for the probability of correct selection from Type-I and Type-II generalized logistic populations which only differ in their location parameter. Some open problems are formulated.

Reference-contexts: + d)dF (x) = P fl : (1) It is of interest to note that the left-hand side of this equation also equals the minimal probability of correct selection if we only select max i X i and where the minimum is over all configurations for which [k] [k1] d <ref> (see van der Laan, 1989) </ref>. The size S of the selected subset with Gupta's selection rule is a random variable with possible outcomes f1; 2; : : :; kg. The expected value of this size of the subset can be used as an efficiency criterion.

Reference-contexts: interested in selecting the best of k logistic populations which only differ in their location parameter and we have a sample of size b from each of these populations, then the median seems to be a perfect candidate for X i , i = 1; : : : ; k <ref> (see Lorenzen and McDonald, 1981) </ref>. The median has in this case a smaller variance than, for example, the mean, in contrary with the normal distribution where the mean is known to be an efficient estimator of its median (which equals its mean).
