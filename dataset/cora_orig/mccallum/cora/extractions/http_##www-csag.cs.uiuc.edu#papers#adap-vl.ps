Reference-contexts: Any particular fixed choice of routes will produce poor performance for some communication patterns. Adaptive routing can alleviate such problems by mapping communications to paths flexibly, based on network loading. The flexibility in routing improves performance on non-uniform work-loads [22] and can provide a measure of fault tolerance <ref> [8] </ref>. The major disadvantage of adaptive routing is the greater complexity required to support the additional routing flexibility while assuring deadlock-freedom. This increase in hardware complexity can significantly reduce router speed, decreasing total network performance. <p> Cost of Adaptivity 4 2.1 Planar-adaptive Routing Planar-Adaptive Routing (PAR) is a limited adaptivity routing algorithm.

Reference-contexts: These routers are all taken from the class of f-flat adaptive routers <ref> [9] </ref>. The f-flat adaptive routing framework can be used with any deadlock-free adaptive routing algorithm within each f-flat; we assume a Linder-Harden router [25] with fully adaptive minimal routing. Increasing routing freedom not only increases the complexity of individual router modules, many more modules are needed.

Reference-contexts: Section 8 discusses related work, and in Section 9, we summarize the results presented in the paper. 2 Background Communication performance depends critically on a network's topology, flow control, and routing. We focus on k-ary n-cubes, direct networks with radix k and dimension n <ref> [12] </ref>. By varying choice of k and n, this family of networks represent a wide range of choices in density of interconnection. We also focus only on routers that use wormhole routing, a low cost approach to flow control that allows small simple routers.

Though both virtual channels and virtual lanes use additional hardware buffers, virtual lanes require greater connectivity in the router as each virtual lane is interchangeable within its virtual channel class. Essentially, this means that the crossbars cannot be partitioned. <p> Essentially, this means that the crossbars cannot be partitioned. In this section, we first consider the pros and cons of several proposed architectures for virtual lanes, then estimate the speed and cost of the most attractive architecture. 6.1 Architectural Alternatives for Virtual Lanes In <ref> [13] </ref>, Dally proposes three alternatives for implementing virtual lanes, which differ primarily in the size of the crossbar switch and how it is multiplexed (Figure 10). A 2-input, 2-output CB is used for illustrative purposes. <p> Justifying second and third virtual lanes require 30% further increases in channel utilization for each. Published simulations studies show that such increases are possible for a modest number of virtual lanes, but performance increases sufficient to justify larger numbers of virtual lanes appear unlikely <ref> [13, 22] </ref>. By examining the implementation complexity of adaptive routing and virtual lanes, we seek to balance their cost and benefit. While much research has been published on the advantages of these features, we hope to provoke debate on their cost and real benefits.

Fair arbitration is used to prevent starvation when a packet has already been forced to wait. 3.6 Switching A router must switch the packets, conveying data from appropriate inputs to outputs.

Reference-contexts: Between nodes, both the data and flow control signals are asynchronous, so the synchronization time increases the effective delay in both directions. The XFC synchronizes the incoming data, and the VC synchronizes backward flow control signals using an synchronizer based on a Muller C element <ref> [26] </ref> to sample the input signal. Pipelined flow control, synchronization penalty, channel delay, and clock skew all increase the buffer requirements of wormhole routing. Synchronous pipelined flow control with unit delay channels requires two flit buffers, and the synchronization delay increases the buffer requirement to four flits.

Reference-contexts: The data throughput is 36 MB/s (32 Mhz). The latency of the routing is 62:5 ns per hop. Recent Router Designs The latest Caltech EMRC routing chips are also dimension-order, wormhole routers <ref> [31] </ref>. These chips are self-timed and use byte wide channels to achieve 166 MB/s. The typical path formation latency for the head of a packet is approximately 30ns. The Intel Paragon router is descended from the original Caltech MRCs [11, 18].
