Title: Software-only video production switcher for the Internet MBone  
Author: Tina Wong Ketan Mayer-Patel David Simpson Lawrence A. Rowe 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California,  
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a prototype software video production switcher, vps, that improves the quality of the content of MBone broadcasts. vps is modeled after the broadcast television industry's studio production switcher. It provides special effects processing to incorporate audience discussions, add titles and other information, and integrate stored videos into the presentation. vps is structured to work with other MBone conferencing tools. The ultimate goal is to automate the production of MBone broadcasts.

Reference-contexts: The system is implemented with the Continuous Media Toolkit (CMT) <ref> [4] </ref> which is described in more detail in section 4. 3.1 Studio MBone The Studio MBone is an RTP session [11] with a single multicast group and two port numbers 2 on which vps processes transmit video data and control messages.

For our broadcasts, the Studio MBone spans our building. 2 This multicast address can be chosen through the session directory protocol <ref> [5] </ref> to avoid conflicting with other multicast groups. Since the Studio MBone spans only Berkeley, we only need to allocate a multicast address not in use on campus.

Reference-contexts: The shared whiteboard tool wb is used to distribute postscript slides. A second wb is used by the broadcast director (hereafter, director) to communicate with participants in order to debug problems with the transmission and monitor video and audio quality. We are also testing a floor control tool qb <ref> [6] </ref> to facilitate question asking. The current broadcast uses a single camera that mainly focuses on the speaker, and occasionally pans to show other materials such as slides on the overhead projector, a demo running on a workstation, or members of the local audience.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes the design and implementation of a prototype software-only video production switcher (vps) that can be used to improve the content of an MBone broadcast. vps is modeled after a studio production switcher <ref> [9] </ref> used in the broadcast television industry. A studio production switcher is a custom-designed hardware device that provides an array of real-time editing and special effects functions. A director can select one of several picture sources (e.g., cameras, videotapes, and still image displays) to be the output.

Reference-contexts: However, this solution has several limitations. First, video sources must be converted to a switch-specific analog format before being passed to the switcher and converted back to a digital format and encapsulated as RTP data <ref> [11] </ref> after processing so that it can be sent to the MBone. vps avoids these conversions by operating on video streams in the RTP representation. Second, a hardware system is not extensible. vps is designed in a modular manner to allow new effects to be added to the system. <p> The system is implemented with the Continuous Media Toolkit (CMT) [4] which is described in more detail in section 4. 3.1 Studio MBone The Studio MBone is an RTP session <ref> [11] </ref> with a single multicast group and two port numbers 2 on which vps processes transmit video data and control messages. The vps processes need to know about this multicast address and it can be configured as a command-line argument at system startup.

Reference-contexts: The effects supported by the prototype vps are fade, mix, picture-in-picture (PIP) and subtitle. The fade and mix effects are implemented in the compressed MJPEG domain which means the streams are not fully-decoded before being processed <ref> [12] </ref>. PIP and subtitle are implemented in the uncompressed YUV domain which means the streams must be fully-decoded before being processed. More details about the effects processing algorithms are presented in the next section. There can be more than one fx processor depending on the computing resources available. <p> The mix and fade effects are generated in the compressed JPEG domain, which process MJPEG streams and output in the same format. The algorithms that manipulate images in the compressed domain are fully described in <ref> [12] </ref>. To investigate the performance of the current effects implementation, we conducted experiments to determine the latency of each effects on each frame. We also measured the performance of the MJPEG to YUV decoding operation. <p> Clearly, effects processing in the compressed domain is much faster than converting a stream to YUV, applying the transformation, and converting back to MJPEG <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Ultimately, our goal is to automate the production process by integrating vps with a broadcast management system <ref> [13] </ref> that maintains room, equipment and broadcast configurations, observes event schedules, and launches and monitors the MBone tools required to produce a broadcast. Figure 1 shows how vps fits into the context of a typical MBone broadcast.
