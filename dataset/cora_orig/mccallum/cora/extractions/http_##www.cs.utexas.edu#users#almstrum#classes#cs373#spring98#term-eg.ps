Reference-contexts: I have also used the framing feature of Microsoft Word to place the figure with its caption at the bottom of the column. I have also included two references, which are given in alphabetical order by first author's last name. I could refer to <ref> [1] </ref>, the first reference, as part of the flow of the text. Another style is to put the reference at the end of the sentence [2]. Title of Dr. A's Dissertation The title of the dissertation was Limitations in the Understanding of Mathematical Logic by Pre-College Computer Science Students. <p> Then you will give it this special style, which is slightly indented from both sides. It has the style name blockquote. <ref> [1, p. 99] </ref> It is very useful to learn how to use styles such as the ones I have used to create this document. It makes the task of formatting much less tedious.
