Abstract: We introduce a new method, called Priority Encoding Transmission, for sending messages over lossy packet-based networks. When a message is to be transmitted, the user specifies a priority value for each part of the message. Based on the priorities, the system encodes the message into packets for transmission and sends them to (possibly multiple) receivers. The priority value of each part of the message determines the fraction of encoding packets sufficient to recover that part. Thus, even if some of the encoding packets are lost enroute, each receiver is still able to recover the parts of the message for which a sufficient fraction of the encoding packets are received. y Computer Science Department, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzer-land.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 describes a (weak) lower bound on the packet length for any PET system. Little effort is made to make the systems efficient. [9, Blomer et al.] describes an efficient implementation of the main building block of any PET system. A preliminary version of this paper appeared in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 2 Video Multicasting Information from the sender must be received by all users participating in the multicast session. Present applications use protocols that retransmit missing information when communicating with multiple receivers. Consequently, the information rate is determined by the worst case receiver.

Reference-contexts: message is missing, and in particular the decoding is trivial if none of the unencoded message part of the encoding is missing. 9 A different family of codes, called (1 + *)-MDS codes, that have slightly weaker erasure-resilient properties than the MDS-code described above have been described and constructed in <ref> [4, Alon et al.] </ref> and [5, Alon, Luby].

Reference-contexts: In the networking community encoding systems which allow recovery of the message from only a subset of packets of the encoding have been proposed, for example a system based on Reed-Solomon-codes was suggested by [16, McAuley] and empirically evaluated by <ref> [8, Biersack] </ref>. A similar encoding system has been proposed by [16, Rabin]. He uses essentially the same coding techniques that are used in this paper. However, these systems allow only one priority level for the entire message. [17, Shacham] also suggests methods for sending prioritized messages over networks.

Reference-contexts: The B-frames are the least important frames. A PET system can be used to protect I-frames more against losses than P-frames, which in turn are protected more than B-frames. This approach has been taken in <ref> [13] </ref>. The results are promising. 4 3 Requirements of a PET system We assume throughout this paper that there is a basic word size w which is long enough to implement all of the encoding schemes we describe. <p> Thus, i can also be thought of as the fraction of encoding packets needed to recover the first i words of the message. In our implementations of PET systems ([2], <ref> [13] </ref>) the user specifies the message length m, the packet length `; and the priority function , and the system computes the number of encoding packets n and implements the encoding and decoding procedures that achieve the guarantees as specified in Definition 3.1. <p> It is a variant of Reed-Solomon-codes that is based on so-called Cauchy matrices (see the references in [9]). This implementation takes quadratic time for both the encoding and decoding. However, it is efficient enough to support existing real-time video applications implemented on current workstations (see <ref> [13] </ref>). This code is also systematic, i.e., the unencoded message is part of the encoding.

Reference-contexts: Both JPEG and MPEG apply a discrete cosine transform to the video image to produce what is hereafter called a message [21, Wallace], <ref> [14, Le Gall] </ref>. Besides allowing a highly compressed representation of the image, this message has a nice property. Consider ordering the information in the message so that the lowest frequency coefficients come first followed by successively higher frequency coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the larger the value of d the better the recovery properties of the decoding. In the best case, when d = n m + 1, the code is called in the literature a maximum distance separable (MDS) code (see for example <ref> [15] </ref>). In this case the message can be recovered from any portion of the encoding (in units of words) equal to the length of the message. In this paper, all codes are MDS unless otherwise specified.

Reference-contexts: The codes are based on expander graphs and, for constant *, admit linear time encoding and decoding. At present their practical value is doubtful. However, probabilistic codes based on the ideas in [4],[5], on the codes using Cauchy matrices and on ideas from <ref> [18, Spielman] </ref> show promise of being more efficient than deterministic codes in practice. As mentioned at the end of Section 4.3, these codes can be used directly to implement probabilistic PET systems that have faster encoding and decoding algorithms.

Reference-contexts: For these codes the theorem gives a lower bound on the word size of approximately log ((c 1)=*): The bound is asymptotically tight. The algebraic-geometric codes achieve these bounds (see for example <ref> [19] </ref>). Notice that if k is cm; c &gt; 1 then the theorem can only yield constant lower bounds.
