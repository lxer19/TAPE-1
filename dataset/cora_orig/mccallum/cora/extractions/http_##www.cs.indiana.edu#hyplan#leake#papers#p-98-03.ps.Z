Abstract: Experience with the growing number of large-scale CBR systems has led to increasing recognition of the importance of case-base maintenance. Multiple researchers have addressed pieces of the case-base maintenance problem, considering such issues as maintaining consistency and controlling case-base growth. However, despite the existence of these cases of case-base maintenance, there is no general framework of dimensions for describing case-base maintenance systems. Such a framework would be useful both to understand the state of the art in case-base maintenance and to suggest new avenues of exploration by identifying points along the dimensions that have not yet been studied. This paper presents a first attempt at identifying the dimensions of case-base maintenance. It shows that characterizations along such dimensions can suggest avenues for future case-base maintenance research and presents initial steps exploring one of those avenues: identifying patterns of problems that require generalized revisions and addressing them with lazy updating.

Reference-contexts: These systems generalize a case-base either explicitly, by merging cases with similar coverage (e.g., Domingos 1995) or implicitly, by choosing a smaller, representative subset of cases <ref> (e.g., Aha, Kibler & Albert 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The growing use of CBR applications has brought with it increased awareness of the importance of case-base maintenance (CBM). Large-scale CBR systems are becoming more prevalent, with case library sizes ranging from thousands <ref> (e.g., Cheetham 1997, Kitano & Shimazu 1996) </ref> to millions of cases (Deangdej et al. 1996). Large case-bases raise concerns about the utility problem for case retrieval (Francis & Ram 1993; Smyth & Cunningham 1996), underlining the potential need to control case-base growth through case deletion policies (Smyth & Keane 1995).

Reference-contexts: Thus maintenance of case-base contents may revise the case-base at the implementation level, representation level, or the knowledge level <ref> (cf. Dietterich 1986) </ref>. Our definition of maintenance implicitly includes policies for performing CBM indirectly, by revising the maintenance policies themselves.

Reference-contexts: Policies targeting indices: A number of classification systems using IBL and related techniques (IBL) include policies for eliminating noisy and redundant instances from a set of training examples (cases). These systems generalize a case-base either explicitly, by merging cases with similar coverage <ref> (e.g., Domingos 1995) </ref> or implicitly, by choosing a smaller, representative subset of cases (e.g., Aha, Kibler & Albert 1991). Such policies typically consider a static set of cases (synchronic), are user-initiated (ad hoc), perform execution off-line, and are applied to the entire training set (broad).

Reference-contexts: Although our framework focuses only on case-base maintenance, in general CBM can be viewed as part of the larger task of CBR system maintenance <ref> (e.g., Heister & Wilke 1998) </ref>. 7 Future Work Many CBM issues remain to be investigated. Because, to our knowledge, the role of usage trends in guiding maintenance has not yet been explored in other research, we consider it an especially promising area.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a first step in the direction of a general CBM framework. It proposes a set of dimensions for describing CBM, uses them to characterize sample CBM policies, discusses the relationship of CBM to the revision of other CBR knowledge containers <ref> (Richter 1995) </ref>, and highlights points for investigation suggested by the framework. We make no claim of providing a final taxonomy or a complete summary. <p> problem that is in general very complex, but it appears practical for this type of change and shows the benefit of considering diachronic information when triggering maintenance. 6 Maintenance and Overlapping Knowledge Containers The multiple knowledge containers of CBR overlap; knowledge available in one can replace missing knowledge in another <ref> (Richter 1995) </ref>. Likewise, the effects of maintenance to one knowledge source may be equivalent to maintenance on another. For example, the same overall effects on system accuracy might be achieved by case-base reorganization|which we consider part of case-base maintenance|or by adjustment of the similarity measure|which we consider external to CBM.

Reference-contexts: Because the cases are added manually outside of normal processing, the integration is off-line. Because the number of cases can be small or large, the scope varies from narrow to broad.

Reference-contexts: Large case-bases raise concerns about the utility problem for case retrieval (Francis & Ram 1993; Smyth & Cunningham 1996), underlining the potential need to control case-base growth through case deletion policies <ref> (Smyth & Keane 1995) </ref>. <p> Examination of this information can determine, for example, whether a case is worth adding to a case-base because it increases the competence of the CBR system, or whether a solution can be discarded without affecting competence <ref> (Smyth & Keane 1995) </ref>. Policies that consider snapshot information are called synchronic. The most informative approach is to collect data over time, over a sequence of snapshots, in order to identify trends in how case-base contents and usage are changing. <p> Periodic timing that happens every cycle is termed continuous. Conditional data collection is performed in response to a well-defined but non-periodic condition. For example, analysis might be triggered whenever the number of cases in the case library reaches a particular threshold <ref> (Smyth & Keane 1995) </ref>.
