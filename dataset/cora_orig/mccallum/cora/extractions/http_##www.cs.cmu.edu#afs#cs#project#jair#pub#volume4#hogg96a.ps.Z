Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems.

Reference-contexts: This state violates the normalization condition. Thus we see that this classical operation is not physically realizable for a quantum computer. Similarly, another common classical operation, making a copy of a bit, is also ruled out (Svozil, 1995), forming the basis for quantum cryptography <ref> (Bennett, 1992) </ref>. 3.3 Some Approaches to Search A device consisting of n quantum bits allows for operations on superpositions of 2 n classical states. This ability to operate simultaneously on an exponentially large number of states with just a linear number of bits is the basis for quantum parallelism.

Reference-contexts: There are also uniquely quantum mechanical approaches to controlling errors <ref> (Berthiaume, Deutsch, & Jozsa, 1994) </ref> based on partial measurements of the state.

Reference-contexts: This shows a trade-off between time and energy (or other physical resources), conjectured to apply more generally to solving these search problems <ref> (Cerny, 1993) </ref>, and also seen in the trade-off of time and number of processors in parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the additional structure of the necessary nogoods and the larger size of the constraints, compared with the previous class of problems, makes it more likely that larger problems will be required to see the asymptotic scaling behavior. However, at least some asymptotic behaviors have been observed <ref> (Crawford & Auton, 1993) </ref> to persist quite accurately even for problems as small as n = 3, so some indication of the scaling behavior is not out of the question for the small problems considered here. 4.2.1 Phase Transition The behavior of the algorithm as a function of the ratio of

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, this quantum parallelism can be viewed as a large parallel computer requiring no more hardware than that needed for a single processor. On the other hand, the range of allowable operations is rather limited. To describe this more concretely, we adopt the conventional ket notation from quantum mechanics <ref> (Dirac, 1958, section 6) </ref> to denote various states 3 . That is, we use jffi to denote the state of a computer described by ff. At a low level of description, the state of a classical computer is described by values of its bits.

Reference-contexts: An example is the development of parallel computers with their trade-off of overall computation time against the number of processors employed. Effective use of this trade-off can require algorithms that would be very inefficient if implemented serially. Another example is given by hypothetical quantum computers <ref> (DiVincenzo, 1995) </ref>. They offer the potential of exploiting quantum parallelism to trade computation time against the use of coherent interference among very many different computational paths. <p> This ability to manipulate quantum superpositions has been demonstrated in small cases (Zhu, Kleiman, Li, Lu, Trentelman, & Gordon, 1995). Another possibility is through the use of atomically precise manipulations <ref> (DiVincenzo, 1995) </ref> using a scanning tunneling or atomic force microscope. This possibility of precise manipulation of chemical reactions has also been demonstrated (Muller, Klein, Lee, Clarke, McEuen, & Schultz, 1995).

Reference-contexts: This means the search method is incomplete: it can find a solution if one exists but can never guarantee a solution doesn't exist. An alternate conceptual view of these quantum programs is provided by the path integral approach to quantum mechanics <ref> (Feynman, 1985) </ref>. In this view, the final amplitude of a given state is obtained by a weighted sum over all possible paths that produce that state. In this way, the various possibilities involved in a computation can interfere with each other, either constructively or destructively.

Reference-contexts: Another possibility is for the phase to be adjusted based on how many constraints are violated, which could be particularly appropriate for partial constraint satisfaction problems <ref> (Freuder & Wallace, 1992) </ref> or other optimization searches. 3.5.3 Summary The search algorithm starts by evenly dividing amplitude among the goods at a low level K of the lattice.

Reference-contexts: Finally, some important caveats for the implementation of quantum computers and open issues are presented. 2. Combinatorial Search Combinatorial search is among the hardest of common computational problems: the solution time can grow exponentially with the size of the problem <ref> (Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref>. Examples arise in scheduling, planning, circuit layout and machine vision, to name a few areas. Many of these examples can be viewed as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) (Mack-worth, 1992). <p> Both these examples are instances of particularly difficult NP problems known as the class of NP-complete search problems <ref> (Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref>. 2.1 Phase Transitions Much of the theoretical work on NP search problems examines their worst case behavior. Although these search problems can be very hard, in the worst case, there is a great deal of individual variation in these problems and among different search methods.

Reference-contexts: Restricting attention to the subspace defined by the original vectors, this can be obtained 5 using the singular value decomposition <ref> (Golub & Loan, 1983) </ref> (SVD) of the matrix M whose columns are the k given vectors. Specifically, this decomposition is M = A y flB, where fl is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of M and both A y and B have orthonormal columns. <p> Restricting attention to real values, this gives 1 = U y U ffff = k=0 k (17) where n k = i i + 1 k (18) 5. I thank J. Gilbert for pointing out this technique, as a variant of the orthogonal Procrustes prob lem <ref> (Golub & Loan, 1983) </ref>. 106 Quantum Computing and Phase Transitions in Combinatorial Search is the number of ways to pick r with the specified overlap.

Reference-contexts: In between these two cases are the hard problems: enough constraints so good choices are rare but few enough that bad choices are usually recognized only with a lot of additional search. A more detailed analysis suggests a series of transitions <ref> (Hogg & Williams, 1994) </ref>. With very few constraints, the average search cost scales polynomially. As more constraints are added, there is a transition to exponential scaling. The rate of growth of this exponential increases until the transition region described above is reached. <p> Another representation that avoids this problem is to consider assignments in only a single order for the variables (selected randomly or through the use of heuristics). This version of the set lattice has been previously used in theoretical analyses of phase transitions in search <ref> (Williams & Hogg, 1994) </ref>. This may be useful to explore further for the quantum search, but is unlikely to be as effective. <p> Furthermore, the theory predicts there is a regime of polynomial average cost for sufficiently few constraints <ref> (Hogg & Williams, 1994) </ref>. This is determined by the condition that the expected number of goods at each level in the lattice is monotonically increasing. <p> We consider the well-studied NP-complete 3SAT problem where the formula is a conjunction of c clauses, each of which is a disjunction of 3 (possibly negated) variables. The SAT problem is readily represented by nogoods in the lattice of sets <ref> (Williams & Hogg, 1994) </ref>. As described in Sec. 2.2, there will be n necessary nogoods, each of size 2. In addition, each distinct clause in the proposition gives a single nogood of size 3. This case is thus of additional interest in having specified nogoods of two sizes. <p> The transition behavior is readily understood because problems near the transition point have many large partial goods that do not lead to solutions <ref> (Williams & Hogg, 1994) </ref>. Thus there will be a relatively high proportion of paths through the lattice that appear good for quite a while but eventually give deadends.

Reference-contexts: Ignoring the variation in the magnitude of the amplitudes at each level this gives r j = r j1 m=1 + p 103 Hogg because the sum of j random phases is equivalent to an unbiased random walk <ref> (Karlin & Taylor, 1975) </ref> with j unit steps which has expected net distance of p j. Thus r j = r k p or r j = j!k! for j&gt;k. This crude argument gives a rough estimate of the relative probabilities for solutions compared to complete nogoods.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Computation is ultimately a physical process <ref> (Landauer, 1991) </ref>. That is, in practice the range of physically realizable devices determines what is computable and the resources, such as computer time, required to solve a given problem. Computing machines can exploit a variety of physical processes and structures to provide distinct trade-offs in resource requirements.

Reference-contexts: An important practical question is the physical implementation of quantum computers in general (Barenco et al., 1995; Sleator & Weinfurter, 1995; Cirac & Zoller, 1995), and the requirements imposed by the algorithm described here. Any implementation of a quantum computer will need to deal with two important difficulties <ref> (Landauer, 1994) </ref>. First, there will be defects in the construction of the device. Thus even if an ideal design exactly produces the desired mapping, occasional manufacturing defects and environmental noise will introduce errors. We thus need to understand the sensitivity of the algorithm's behavior to errors in the mappings.

A simple computation on a quantum bit is the logical NOT operation, i.e., NOT (j0i) = j1i and NOT (j1i) = j0i.

For random 3SAT, the hard problems are concentrated near the transition <ref> (Mitchell et al., 1992) </ref> at c = 4:2n. Finally, from among these randomly generated problems, we use only those that do in fact have a solution 15 . Using randomly selected soluble problems results in somewhat harder problems than using a prespecified solution.

Reference-contexts: The amplitudes of the superposition just before the measurement is made determine the probability of obtaining a solution. The overall structure is a probabilistic Monte Carlo computation <ref> (Motwani & Raghavan, 1995) </ref> in which at each trial there is some probability to get a solution, but no guarantee. This means the search method is incomplete: it can find a solution if one exists but can never guarantee a solution doesn't exist.

Reference-contexts: Finally, from among these randomly generated problems, we use only those that do in fact have a solution 15 . Using randomly selected soluble problems results in somewhat harder problems than using a prespecified solution. Like other studies that need to examine many goods and nogoods in the lattice <ref> (Schrag & Crawford, 1996) </ref>, these results are restricted to much smaller problems than in most studies of random SAT. Consequently, the transition region is rather spread out.

Reference-contexts: Search methods use various strategies for examining the sets in this lattice. For instance, methods such as simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, & Vecchi, 1983), heuristic repair (Minton, Johnston, Philips, & Laird, 1992) and GSAT <ref> (Selman, Levesque, & Mitchell, 1992) </ref> move among complete sets, attempting to find a solution by a series of small changes to the sets. Generally these search techniques continue indefinitely if the problem has no solution and thus they can never show that a problem is insoluble.

Reference-contexts: This state violates the normalization condition. Thus we see that this classical operation is not physically realizable for a quantum computer. Similarly, another common classical operation, making a copy of a bit, is also ruled out <ref> (Svozil, 1995) </ref>, forming the basis for quantum cryptography (Bennett, 1992). 3.3 Some Approaches to Search A device consisting of n quantum bits allows for operations on superpositions of 2 n classical states.

Reference-contexts: In between these two cases are the hard problems: enough constraints so good choices are rare but few enough that bad choices are usually recognized only with a lot of additional search. A more detailed analysis suggests a series of transitions <ref> (Hogg & Williams, 1994) </ref>. With very few constraints, the average search cost scales polynomially. As more constraints are added, there is a transition to exponential scaling. The rate of growth of this exponential increases until the transition region described above is reached. <p> Another representation that avoids this problem is to consider assignments in only a single order for the variables (selected randomly or through the use of heuristics). This version of the set lattice has been previously used in theoretical analyses of phase transitions in search <ref> (Williams & Hogg, 1994) </ref>. This may be useful to explore further for the quantum search, but is unlikely to be as effective. <p> Furthermore, the theory predicts there is a regime of polynomial average cost for sufficiently few constraints <ref> (Hogg & Williams, 1994) </ref>. This is determined by the condition that the expected number of goods at each level in the lattice is monotonically increasing. <p> We consider the well-studied NP-complete 3SAT problem where the formula is a conjunction of c clauses, each of which is a disjunction of 3 (possibly negated) variables. The SAT problem is readily represented by nogoods in the lattice of sets <ref> (Williams & Hogg, 1994) </ref>. As described in Sec. 2.2, there will be n necessary nogoods, each of size 2. In addition, each distinct clause in the proposition gives a single nogood of size 3. This case is thus of additional interest in having specified nogoods of two sizes. <p> The transition behavior is readily understood because problems near the transition point have many large partial goods that do not lead to solutions <ref> (Williams & Hogg, 1994) </ref>. Thus there will be a relatively high proportion of paths through the lattice that appear good for quite a while but eventually give deadends.

Reference-contexts: Despite the simple values for the example of Eq. 16, the a k values in general do not appear to have a simple closed form expression. This is suggested by obtaining exact solu tions to Eqs. 17 and 19 using the Mathematica symbolic algebra program <ref> (Wolfram, 1991) </ref>. In most cases this gives complicated expressions involving nested roots. Since such expres sions could simplify, the a k values were also checked for being close to rational numbers and whether they are roots of single variable polynomials of low degree 8 .

Reference-contexts: The use of lasers of appropriate frequencies can switch such an atom between the two states or create superpositions of the two classical states. This ability to manipulate quantum superpositions has been demonstrated in small cases <ref> (Zhu, Kleiman, Li, Lu, Trentelman, & Gordon, 1995) </ref>. Another possibility is through the use of atomically precise manipulations (DiVincenzo, 1995) using a scanning tunneling or atomic force microscope. This possibility of precise manipulation of chemical reactions has also been demonstrated (Muller, Klein, Lee, Clarke, McEuen, & Schultz, 1995).
