Title: C H A P T E R THE MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO METHOD: AN APPROACH
Author: Mark Jerrum Alistair Sinclair 
Note: 482  
Abstract: In the area of statistical physics, Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markov chain simulation have been in use for many years. The validity of these algorithms depends crucially on the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the Markov chain being simulated. Unfortunately, the classical theory of stochastic processes hardly touches on the sort of non-asymptotic analysis required in this application. As a consequence, it had previously not been possible to make useful, mathematically rigorous statements about the quality of the estimates obtained. Within the last ten years, analytical tools have been devised with the aim of correcting this deficiency. As well as permitting the analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for classical problems in statistical physics, the introduction of these tools has spurred the development of new approximation algorithms for a wider class of problems in combinatorial enumeration and optimization. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method has been applied to a variety of such problems, and often provides the only known efficient (i.e., polynomial time) solution technique.

Reference-contexts: This problem arises in the interpretation of the results of certain kinds of statistical experiment; see, for example, Diaconis and Efron <ref> [DE85] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The running time per coefficient is no worse than for m n .

Reference-contexts: See Section 12.4 for an example. 492 CHAPTER 12 THE MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO METHOD 12.3.2 CONDUCTANCE As advertised earlier, we now consider an alternative conductance approach to bounding t x ."/, which has proved useful in situations where the Markov chain can be given a geometric interpretation <ref> [DFK91] </ref>. The conductance [SJ89] of Markov chain M is defined by D .M/ D min 0&lt;.S/1=2 .S/ where Q.S; S / denotes the sum of Q.x ; y/ over edges fx ; yg 2 E with x 2 S and y 2 S D S. <p> This empirical observation is supported by a result of Dyer and Frieze [DF88] to the effect that evaluating the volume of a polytope exactly is #P-hard. In contrast, by applying the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, Dyer, Frieze, and Kannan <ref> [DFK91] </ref> were able to construct an FPRAS for the volume of a convex body in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension.

Reference-contexts: The wider question of whether there exists an FPRAS of any kind for the Knapsack problem is also unresolved, though the Markov chain simulation approach sketched above seems to offer the best hope. Using it, Dyer et al. <ref> [DFKKPV93] </ref> were able to obtain a randomized approximation scheme for the number of Knapsack solutions whose running time is " 2 exp O. n .log n/ 5=2 / , and this is asymptotically the fastest known.

Reference-contexts: We might hope that a sufficiently uniform distribution on lattice points could be obtained by sampling from the (continuous) convex polytope and rounding to a nearby lattice point. Dyer, Kannan, and Mount <ref> [DKM95] </ref> show that this can be done, provided that the row- and column-sums are sufficiently large; specifically, that each sum is at least .n C m/nm. The case of small row- and column-sums remains open.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that this problem can be solved in polynomial time, but the algorithm for non-bipartite graphs is far from trivial <ref> [Edm65] </ref>. We shall show that the much simpler Metropolis algorithm solves the problem for most graphs, and finds a good approximate solution for all graphs, with high probability in polynomial time. The key to the algorithm's success is a carefully chosen value of the parameter ff.

Reference-contexts: Although there are many situations in which a source of random bits seems to aid computation, the current example is particularly interesting in that randomness is of provable value. It has been shown by Elekes <ref> [Elek86] </ref> that a deterministic algorithm that is restricted to a subexponential number of oracle calls is unable to obtain a good (say, to within a ratio of 2) approximation to the volume of a convex body.

Reference-contexts: This quantity has an interpretation as the partition function of a system of hard dimers, in which no monomers are permitted. This algorithm, due independently to Fisher, Kasteleyn, and Temperley <ref> [Fish61, Kast61, TF61] </ref> in 1961, is a landmark achievement in the design of combinatorial algorithms. Unfortunately, it does not seem to extend either to non-planar graphs or to other coefficients. 9 By analogy with the definition given in Section 12.2, this assumes that the edge weight is presented in unary.

Reference-contexts: This application will illustrate the full power of the analysis techniques described in the previous section. Our presentation is an improved version of one we originally gave in <ref> [JS89, Sin93] </ref>. The problem in question is a classical one from statistical physics, known as the monomer-dimer problem. <p> Following the notation of the previous section, let us write m k D m k .G/ for the number of k-matchings in G. Then the number of perfect matchings is m n , and the number of near-perfect matchings is m n1 . Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [JS89] </ref> showed that there exists a randomized approximation scheme for the number of perfect matchings m n whose running time is polynomial in n, " 1 and the ratio m n1 =m n . <p> =m n 4n tends to 0 as n ! 1. 14 Thus, the above algorithm constitutes an FPRAS for almost all graphs; moreover, the condition that the ratio m n1 =m n be bounded by a specified polynomial in n can be tested for an arbitrary graph in polynomial time <ref> [JS89] </ref>. It is also known [Bro86] that every sufficiently dense graph (specifically, those in which every vertex has degree at least 1 2 n) satisfies m n1 =m n D O.n 2 /. <p> Broder's Markov chain was first proved to be rapidly mixing (under the above condition on G) by Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [JS89] </ref>, using a canonical paths argument as in Section 12.3. An alternative, more natural approximation algorithm for the permanent follows quite painlessly from our results about the monomer-dimer problem derived in the previous section. <p> fact that the sequence m 0 ; m 1 ; : : : ; m n is log-concave, i.e., m k1 m kC1 m 2 k for k D 1; 2; : : : ; n 1. (This is well known [HL72]; a direct combinatorial proof may be found in <ref> [JS89] </ref>.) As a consequence, it follows that m k1 =m k m n1 =m n for all k, and hence that m k =m n .m n1 =m n / nk . <p> First of all, it is not hard to see, again using the log-concavity property, that the above technique can be extended to approximate the entire sequence .m k /, or equivalently all the coefficients of the monomer-dimer partition function <ref> [JS89] </ref>. The running time per coefficient is no worse than for m n .

The former problem is again connected with matchings in a graph, but rather remotely, and a fair amount of work is required to establish and verify the connection [MW91]. The latter makes use of a Markov chain that is much simpler in structure to those considered here [BS85], and whose analysis requires a far less sophisticated application of the canonical paths approach.

The above result on approximating maximum matchings was obtained via a more complex argument by Sasaki and Hajek <ref> [SH88] </ref>, who also show that this result is best possible in the sense that the Metropolis algorithm cannot be expected to find a truly maximum matching in arbitrary graphs in polynomial time, even if the algorithm is allowed to vary the parameter ff in an arbitrarily complicated fashion.

Reference-contexts: We describe the canonical path argument first, and complete the section with a treatment of the conductance argument. For further discussion of these approaches, and various refinements of them, see, e.g., <ref> [DS91, Sin92, DSC93, Kah95] </ref>. <p> Intuitively, we might expect a Markov chain to be rapidly mixing if it contains no bottlenecks, i.e., if it admits a choice of paths 0 for which .0/ is not too large. This intuition is formalized in the following result from Sinclair <ref> [Sin92] </ref>, which is a slight modification of a theorem of Diaconis and Stroock [DS91].

Reference-contexts: This quantity has an interpretation as the partition function of a system of hard dimers, in which no monomers are permitted. This algorithm, due independently to Fisher, Kasteleyn, and Temperley <ref> [Fish61, Kast61, TF61] </ref> in 1961, is a landmark achievement in the design of combinatorial algorithms. Unfortunately, it does not seem to extend either to non-planar graphs or to other coefficients. 9 By analogy with the definition given in Section 12.2, this assumes that the edge weight is presented in unary.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, computing the number of accepting computations is at least as hard as deciding whether an accepting computation exists, so #P certainly contains NP. Less obviously, as Toda <ref> [Tod89] </ref> has demonstrated, #P also essentially contains the entire Meyer-Stockmeyer polynomial-time hierarchy. Thus, in structural terms, and maybe in fact, a #P-complete problem is computationally even harder than an NP-complete one [Jer94].

The nature of the convincing evidence mentioned above is that the problem of counting Knapsack solutions is complete for Valiant's complexity class #P [GJ79, Val79b] with respect to polynomial-time Turing reductions.
