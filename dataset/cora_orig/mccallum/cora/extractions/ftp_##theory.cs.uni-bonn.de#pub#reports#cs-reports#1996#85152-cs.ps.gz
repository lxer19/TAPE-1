Abstract: Let K be algebraically or real closed field, fl a finite dimensional assotia-tive K-algebra with the unity element and V a finitely generated fl-module. An algorithm of polynomial complexity is described in the paper which decomposes V into the direct sum V = i2I V i of indecomposable fl-modules V i . In particular an algorithm is suggested for constructing all the projective non-isomorphic indecomposable fl-modules. Also an algorithm of polynomial complexity is constructed which given two fl-modules V 1 and V 2 decides whether V 1 is isomorphic to V 2 and if it is the fact constructs this isomorphism. As an application the following results are obtained. Let A 1 ; : : : ; A m and A 0 m be two families of n fi n-matrices with coefficients from K. An algorithm of polynomial complexity is described in the paper which decides whether there exists a nonsingular (respectively orthogonal) n fi n-matrix S with coefficients from K such that SA i S 1 = A 0 i for all 1 i m and if it is
