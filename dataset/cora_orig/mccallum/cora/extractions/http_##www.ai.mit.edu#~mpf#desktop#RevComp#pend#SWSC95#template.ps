Note: Please follow these instructions carefully. Submit a single-sided original (for reproduction) and 15 double-sided and 3-hole punched copies (for committee evaluation) of a 2-page abstract that briefly describes the technical contributions of the work. The first page *must* begin with a title, the author's name, and MIT and email addresses. Joint submissions by students are acceptable, but the student making the presentation should be listed as first author. Faculty coauthorship is not allowed, although  is supported in part by ARPA contract N00014-94-1-09885, by NSF Experimental Systems grant MIP-9012773, and by an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award to Prof. Agarwal.  stracts based on joint work with faculty members are permitted. The abstract should describe the essential ideas in the research and have a short bibliography that includes any published papers or technical memoranda on which the abstract is based. Every abstract  the first page should identify the student's faculty supervisor and acknowledge research support. References [Bre91]

Abstract: This is a sample latex template for abstracts submitted to the 1995 Student Workshop on Scalable Computing. The workshop will be sponsored by the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science to promote an interchange of ideas among the various research activities at MIT related to scalable computing. This year's student workshop will be entirely organized by students. Students | undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral | are encouraged to submit short, 2-page abstracts of recent technical accomplishments. All submitted abstracts will be bound in a volume to be distributed at the workshop and which will later be available as an LCS technical report. About 18 of the submitted abstracts will be selected for presentation. Figure 1 is an example of a figure which is one column in width. Figure 2 is an example of a figure which is two columns in width. These are cites for a book [Lei92], a conference paper [L + 92], a journal paper [Fis81], a technical report [Lei89], a thesis [Bre91], and an unpublished manuscript [CDG + 93].
