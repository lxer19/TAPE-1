Abstract: In previous experiments [Basili96], we showed that the Perspective-Based Reading (PBR) family of defect detection techniques was effective at detecting faults in requirements documents in some contexts. In order to continue adding to our knowledge in this area, we have proposed two modifications to the PBR technique that we will assess in the proposed experiment. The first purpose of the experiment is to investigate whether defect detection in requirements documents can be improved by focusing on the errors (i.e. underlying human misconceptions) in a document rather than the individual faults that they cause. The rationale for this is that, in our experience, faults have been very difficult to quantify, classify, and define. Additionally, by treating faults as isolated entities there is little possibility for using discovered faults to help find new ones. We are investigating whether the process of abstraction from faults to errors may give reviewers useful information about the requirements that would help them in discovering additional faults and fixing the document. We will evaluate the effectiveness of error abstraction in both ad hoc and PBR reviews, in order to examine potential interactions between the abstraction process and the fault detection technique used. The secondary purpose of the experiment is to investigate the effect of increasing the specificity of the PBR techniques. In the original experiment with PBR, we asked reviewers to rely on their experience with other processes in the software lifecycle (creating high-level designs, test plans, and user manuals) and to use this experience to answer specific questions. We propose changing the PBR techniques to provide detailed guidelines for each process used (e.g. ObjectOriented design, equivalence partitioning, and constructing use cases, respectively) with the specific questions distributed at key points in the guidelines. For novice reviewers, we hope to see that the additional level of specificity may help make up for the lack of experience in these software development processes. For expert reviewers, we hope to see that the additional specificity helps to focus them on the PBR technique instead of relying on their accustomed approach. To us as experimenters, the additional level of detail in the process means that we can now assess the level of process conformance to the PBR technique. In running this experiment in a classroom environment, we are subject to a number of constraints. Most importantly: Because all members of the class must be taught something, we cannot have a control group (because we cannot have a segment of the class with no treatment or training). Because subjects are not isolated, and would presumably discuss their experiences at various parts of the experiment amongst themselves, we cannot cross the experimental artifacts (that is, use a particular artifact for one group before treatment and for another group after treatment). We therefore use an experimental design which takes the above constraints into account but which can easily be adapted for environments in which the constraints do not hold.
