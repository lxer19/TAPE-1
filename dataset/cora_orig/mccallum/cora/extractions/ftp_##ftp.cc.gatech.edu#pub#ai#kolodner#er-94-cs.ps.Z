Abstract: Creative designers often see solutions to pending design problems in the everyday objects surrounding them. This can often lead to innovation and insight, sometimes revealing new functions and purposes for common design pieces in the process. We are interested in modeling serendipitous recognition of solutions to pending problems in the context of creative mechanical design. This paper characterizes this ability, analyzing observations we have made of it, and placing it in the context of other forms of recognition. We propose a computational model to capture and explore serendipitous recognition which is based on ideas from reconstructive dynamic memory and situation assessment in case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: New evaluative issues emerge that go beyond the stated constraints on the problem. Navin-chandra (1991) calls this criteria emergence. In addition, constraints in general <ref> (Bhatta, Goel, & Prabhakar, 1994) </ref> and relative priorities among them, also gradually emerge. This emergence is a major part of problem evolution. 3. The designers in our examples generated descriptions that allowed immediate recognition of satisficing solutions to the pending problems. <p> In general, discovering the constraints to add to the specification which will require or prohibit some observed feature of a device involves reasoning based on a causal model of the device <ref> (Bhatta, Goel, & Prabhakar, 1994) </ref>. 2 How this decision is chosen, and, in general, how IMPROVISER's sequence of steps is controlled is an interesting modeling issue. However, it is not the subject of this paper, but see (Kolodner & Wills, 1993; Wills & Kolodner, 1994).

Reference-contexts: As we increase our understanding of creative processes, we will be better able to answer the question how best to assist human designers. This may include 1) aiding the formalization, reformulation, and refinement of specifications (Reubenstein & Waters, 1991; Johnson, Benner, & Harris, 1993), 2) bringing up evaluative issues <ref> (Domeshek & Kolodner, 1993) </ref>, 3) retrieving pending problem contexts to help recognize the applicability of solutions, or 4) proposing new control strategies.

Reference-contexts: These three characteristics make this type of recognition more difficult to model than types previously studied. Since the solutions are nonstandard, it is not addressed by object recognition work (e.g., <ref> (Grimson, 1990) </ref>) which typically searches a scene for particular models of existing standard solutions to problems. The type of recognition we are interested in requires models of objects to be constructed on the fly.

Reference-contexts: We propose a computational model of serendipitous recognition based on this hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: Also, by providing several different ways of describing a problem and what would count as a solution, it allows entities to be reinterpreted in the context of the problem and serendipitously recognized as relevant to solving it. Research into situation assessment and problem reformulation (e.g., in CASEY <ref> (Koton, 1988) </ref>, CYRUS (Kolod-ner, 1983), MINSTREL (Turner, 1994), BRAINSTORMER (Jones, 1992), and STRATA (Lowry, 1987)), show different ways this can be done.

We are building on and extending these ideas, exploring in particular how they can be synergistically integrated with evaluation, retrieval, adaptation, and assimilation processes.

Reference-contexts: Jordan and Shrager (1991) model how people select objects for a nonstandard use, based on which object's physical properties relate best to the desired function. However, they do not address how the salient properties are derived or determined. The opportunistic nature of serendipitous recognition makes research on predictive encoding <ref> (Patalano, Seifert, & Hammond, 1993) </ref> and opportunism (Hammond, 1989; Mueller, 1990) relevant to our research. However, they address opportunism in planning situations in which there are standard solutions to the problems at hand.

Reference-contexts: The creativity comes in the preparation that allows recognition of a solution when it is present <ref> (Seifert, et al., 1994) </ref>. This requires becoming immersed in the problem, redescribing it and viewing it from multiple perspectives, considering, comparing, and critiquing several options, so that when a relevant solution is spotted, the way it fits into the problem can be immediately discerned.
