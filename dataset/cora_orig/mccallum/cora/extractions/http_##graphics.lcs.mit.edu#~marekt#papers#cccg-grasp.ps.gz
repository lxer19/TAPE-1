Title: Probabilistic algorithms for efficient grasping and fixturing  
Author: Marek Teichmann 
Abstract: Given an object with n points on its boundary where fingers can be placed, we give algorithms to select a "strong" grasp with a minimal number c of fingers (up to a logarithmic factor) for several measures of goodness. Along similar lines, given an integer c, we find the "best" c log c finger grasp for a small constant . Furthermore, we generalize existing measures for the case of frictionless assemblies of many objects in contact. Depending on the measure, the algorithms run in expected time O(c 2 n 1+ffi ) or O((nc) 1+ffi + c 4 log n log 3 c). Here ffi is any positive constant. This setting generalizes to higher dimensions in the context of finding sets of fixtures. These problems translate into a collection of convex set covering problems. We are given a convex set L, and a set of points U with L conv U in dimension d. There are two basic questions: (1) what is the smallest subset C of U or cover with L conv C, and (2) given an integer c, what is the largest with L conv C among all C U of c points. We present an algorithmic framework which handles these problems in a uniform way and give approximation algorithms for specific instances of L including convex polytopes and balls. It generalizes an algorithm for polytope covering and approximation by Clarkson [Cla93] in several different directions: we show it can be used not only for minimizing cover size, but also maximizing the scaling factor (see above), and further more it is valid for smaller cover sizes than previously possible, with appropriate modifications.

Reference-contexts: This takes time O (jRj bd=2c ) for fixed d 4 (or O (jRj log jRj) if d 3) [Cha93]. For variable d, we can use the algorithm in <ref> [AF92] </ref>, which finds f facets of the convex hull of n points in dimension d in time O (ndf ). Let fl = 1=bd=2c and ffi be any positive constant. <p> cover for B (r) is: O n 1+ffi + (nc) 1=(1+fl=(1+ffi)) + c log (n=c)(c log c) bd=2c for fixed d, or O ncd log (n=c) + cd 2 2 d log (n=c)(4cd log c) bd=2c+1 for any d (and non-degenerate convex hull of the covers) using the result in <ref> [AF92] </ref> and the crude bound on the complexity of the convex hull of d2 d v b d 2 c (derived from the Upper Bound Theorem [MS71].) MinCover-P: The geometric object to be covered is a fixed polytope P with ` vertices containing the origin.

Reference-contexts: These problems can in turn be cast as Hitting Set problems [MS92]. There is also a deterministic analogue of Clarkson's algorithm which solves this problem and which provides a O (d log c)-approximation <ref> [BG94] </ref> in time O It is easy to verify that these hitting set techniques also apply to our MinCover-B problem as well as more general versions. <p> See [Tei95] for details. Finally, to obtain a bound on the running time, we need to bound the number of iterations of the loop in find cover. Again this lemma is a slight variation of Clarkson's and a similar lemma also appears in <ref> [BG94] </ref>. Lemma 3.3 The number of successful iterations of the loop in find cover before a cover is found is bounded above by 2k 2k3 c lg (n=c) which is 4c lg (n=c) for k = 2, 1501c lg (n=c) for k = 1:501. Proof. See [Tei95] for details.

Reference-contexts: The previous framework generalizes to this case by essentially concatenating the force-torque vectors for each object and working in R 6k where k is the number of objects <ref> [BMK94] </ref>. Let m i be the center of mass of object i. In the following definitions 0 is the 6 dimensional zero vector. For each object B i and contact point p let i (p) = [n (p); (p m i ) fi n (p)]. <p> For the set U , we take L. The corresponding optimization problems are MaxScale-P and MinCover-P. 2 Related Results Exact algorithms for the problems mentioned in the previous section that run in polynomial time seem unlikely. In fact problems similar to these have been shown to be NP-hard <ref> [BMK94] </ref> or NP-complete [DJ90]. We therefore consider approximation algorithms for the MinCover and MaxScale problems. The MinCover-P problem arises in a dual form in the context of separating two nested polyhedra [MS92, Cla93]. These problems can in turn be cast as Hitting Set problems [MS92].

Reference-contexts: This can be done by computing the convex hull of R and finding a facet that is at a distance of less than r to the origin. This takes time O (jRj bd=2c ) for fixed d 4 (or O (jRj log jRj) if d 3) <ref> [Cha93] </ref>. For variable d, we can use the algorithm in [AF92], which finds f facets of the convex hull of n points in dimension d in time O (ndf ). Let fl = 1=bd=2c and ffi be any positive constant.

Reference-contexts: For variable d, the entire algorithm runs in ex pected time O ncd log (n=c) + `c 2 d 3 log c log (n=c) + p For fixed d, we can also use linear programming queries using the recent batched version of Chan <ref> [Cha95] </ref> to improve slightly the running time for large l. If ` = O (n), a much simplified expression of the running time is O (n 1+ffi + c 2 n log n log c).

Reference-contexts: Let fl (c) be this maximum. In the approximation version, we ask for a d log c fl - approximation of the best cover C. In the sequel, we will replace L by various convex sets. We present an algorithmic framework derived from an algorithm by Clarkson <ref> [Cla93] </ref> for polytope covering that yields efficient randomized approximation algorithms for the above problems for various types of the set L. In fact, this approach works for any set L for which we can determine whether it lies entirely on one side of a query hyperplane. <p> In fact problems similar to these have been shown to be NP-hard [BMK94] or NP-complete [DJ90]. We therefore consider approximation algorithms for the MinCover and MaxScale problems. The MinCover-P problem arises in a dual form in the context of separating two nested polyhedra <ref> [MS92, Cla93] </ref>. These problems can in turn be cast as Hitting Set problems [MS92]. <p> The correctness of the general algorithm follows from a series of lemmas. The following lemmas were shown in <ref> [Cla93] </ref> for L a convex polytope, but the proofs do not use the fact that L is polyhedral and actually apply to any set L. We state them here for completeness, and also to bound some constants explicitly. <p> We say that a facet F of a polytope P is visible from a point q if for every p 2 F , the segment pq does not meet P . Here P will be conv R. Following <ref> [Cla93] </ref>, we define an L-facet to be a facet visible from of point of L. Then we have the following lemma, which is a slightly modified version of Clarkson's lemma 2.2.

Most existing grasp synthesis algorithms either do not attempt to optimize the grasps found with respect to grasp strength, or do so for very specific situations such as small numbers of fingers, or planar objects. <p> It measures the amount of external force and torque that can be resisted by applying at most a unit force distributed among the grasp points. This is measured by the radius of the largest ball, centered at the origin and contained in conv (G). See also <ref> [FC92] </ref>. Let B () be the ball of radius centered at the origin. For a set A R d , denote the largest radius of such a ball in conv A by r d (A) and call it the residual radius of A. <p> In the same time bound, we can solve the approximation version of MaxScale-P (with c an input parameter), and MinCover-P (with c the optimal cover size.) 1.3 Further applications. Other efficiency measures closely related to the previous one have been proposed, see for example <ref> [FC92] </ref> for a measure based on Minkowski sums instead of convex hulls. Yet another measure was proposed by W. Meyer and was described in [Mis94] see this paper for a survey of grasp efficiency measures.

Reference-contexts: For polyhedral objects [MSS87] give an algorithm for find such a grasp in linear time. However there is no guarantee on the "quality" of the grasp. In <ref> [KMY92] </ref> such a measure of efficiency is proposed. It measures the amount of external force and torque that can be resisted by applying at most a unit force distributed among the grasp points. <p> Note that it cannot be greater than r ((@B)). It is also of interest (see section 1.3) to replace the ball by a certain convex polytope. We would like to obtain grasps of high efficiency but with few fingers. These are two conflicting goals <ref> [KMY92] </ref>, so in this paper we provide algorithms for optimizing one quantity or the other. 1.2 Optimization problems. At this point let us describe the setting for the optimization algorithms in their full generality. Let () be some grasp efficiency measure, generalized to higher dimension (see below). <p> It is unclear however whether these techniques can be applied to yield approximation algorithms for MaxScale-B or MaxScale-P, as they depend on the fact that the set L is fixed. For the MaxScale-B problem, Kirkpatrick et al. <ref> [KMY92] </ref> give an algorithm that finds a cover C of size c containing a ball of radius r (C) = h 1 3d 2d 2 =c i in time O (LP (n; d)c). The radius found is almost optimal for that cover size. <p> We sample conv R by performing the ray shoot-ing queries described above for the case of polytopes, along equally distributed rays on the set of directions (or points on a sphere.) We can use the upper bound contruction of <ref> [KMY92] </ref> to find such a set of points or rays.

Reference-contexts: Fixture elements or fixtures are positioned in contact with the objects to achieve this. Often there is only a finite set of possible placements due to the construction of the workholding table <ref> [ZGW94] </ref>. In this setting, forces applied to an object are due both to contacts between objects, and between objects and fixtures. As in grasping, it is desirable to use a small number of fixtures, and/or limit the forces they must apply on the objects.
