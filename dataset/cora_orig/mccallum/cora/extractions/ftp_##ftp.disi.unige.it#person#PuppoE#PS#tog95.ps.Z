Abstract: A new hierarchical triangle-based model for representing surfaces over sampled data is proposed, which is based on the subdivision of the surface domain into nested triangulations, called a Hierarchical Triangulation (HT). The model allows compression of spatial data and representation of a surface at successively finer degrees of resolution. An HT is a collection of triangulations organized in a tree, where each node, except for the root, is a triangulation refining a face belonging to its parent in the hierarchy. We present a topological model for representing an HT, and algorithms for its construction and for the extraction of a triangulation at a given degree of resolution. The surface model, called a Hierarchical Triangulated Surface (HTS), is obtained by associating data values with the vertices of triangles, and defining suitable functions that describe the surface over each triangular patch. We consider an application of a piecewise-linear version of the HTS to interpolate topographic data, and we describe a specialized version of the construction algorithm that builds an HTS for a terrain starting from a high resolution rectangular grid of sampled data. Finally, we present an algorithm for extracting representations of terrain at variable resolution over the domain.

If an arbitrary triangulation of each generalized triangle is sufficient, the final triangulation can be easily obtained in a single step as follows.

In <ref> [Ber95a] </ref>, pyramidal models were extended to multidimensional models, called pyramidal simplicial complexes; a simple yet efficient data structure was also proposed, which avoids duplications of simplices across different layers, thus making pyramidal models competitive with hierarchical models in terms of storage cost.

More work on this subject is being carried out. The objective is to compare pyramidal versus hierarchical complexes, in terms of storage cost and of performances on the basic operations a multidimensional surface model should support (e.g., extraction of hypersurface at variable resolution, answering geometric queries at different resolution).

Reference-contexts: Whenever the approximation of surface within a quadrant is not sufficiently precise, such quadrant is recursively split into four subrectangles by joining its center to the midpoints of its edges. Subquadrants are linked to their parent quadrant, giving rise to a quadtree. In <ref> [Che86] </ref>, different interpolation techniques for approximating a surface defined by a quadtree are evaluated in terms of precision, computational speed and storage cost. The problem with such interpolants is the difficulty in preserving the continuity of the surface approximation along the sides of the subdivision.

Reference-contexts: The addition of interference links between layers, as in the pyramidal model proposed in <ref> [DeF89] </ref>, can provide means to overcome some such limitations but, on the other hand, it involves a non-negligible storage overhead. The above limitations are not the only drawback of layered models. <p> This undesirable feature was partially overcome by a heuristic hierarchical triangulation proposed in [Sca92], where the splitting rule permits introducing new points either inside and/or on the border of a triangle. The Delaunay pyramid described in <ref> [DeF89] </ref> is a multiresolution triangle-based model whose structure is completely different from all models described above. The Delaunay pyramid is composed of an ordered sequence of Delaunay triangulations of the whole domain, each of which 4 contains an increasing number of vertices.

Reference-contexts: In general, the two approaches cannot coexist. In Section 6, we will describe a model for multiresolution surface description based on a hierarchical Delaunay triangulation <ref> [DeF92] </ref>. The model we propose is matching, adaptive, and error-driven, it supports explicit multiresolution, and admits sparse data, while the shape of triangles is controlled by imposing the Delaunay criterion within each component of the hierarchical structure. <p> However, this subject is not developed in general in this paper: in the following Sections, we consider the case of a piecewise-linear HTS of class C 0 , that we have developed for the representation of topographic surfaces in the context of a geographical application <ref> [DeF92] </ref>. A piecewise-linear hierarchical triangulated surface HD is an HTS whose components are PLTSs. In this case, given the set V of all vertices in HD, and the corresponding set of values f (V), the families of functions of F are uniquely defined through (V; f (V)).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, piecewise-linear models can be used as control nets to define surfaces of higher class <ref> [Far86, Sei92] </ref>. In case a digital model is used to approximate a surface, its effectiveness depends on the precision of the approximation. The approximation error is application dependent, and it is often measured through norms. <p> Smooth surfaces over triangulations can be obtained by using one among the numerous methods developed in the literature (see, e.g., <ref> [Ren84, Far86, Sei92] </ref>). Since adjacent portions of the domain are refined independently in the hierarchical triangulation, it is our intent to investigate further the relation between the matching property of hierarchical triangulations and the smoothness of the surface across adjacent patches.

Reference-contexts: Lately, triangulated surface models have become more and more popular, because of their adaptivity: recent studies have shown the effectiveness of smooth triangle-based representations of surfaces with intricate geometries (see, e.g., <ref> [Fon92] </ref>). Digital models are often intended as approximations of surfaces describing natural objects or phenomena, which are either simulated or measured through some sampling process. A better precision in the approximation is generally achieved by a finer partition of the domain, yielding higher storage cost and computation time.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, such an algorithm has a worst case time complexity of O (n 7 ), and it appears very hard to implement, hence having small practical impact. Here, we adopt a simple algorithm proposed in <ref> [Fow79] </ref>, which refines an existing Delaunay-based PLTS by inserting one vertex at a time, and updating the Delaunay triangulation until the required precision is met. The vertex inserted at each cycle is the point that causes the maximum error in the approximation.

Moreover, piecewise-linear models can be used as control nets to define surfaces of higher class [Far86, Sei92]. In case a digital model is used to approximate a surface, its effectiveness depends on the precision of the approximation. <p> On the other hand, the amount of data in one such model is usually very large, and the need has been pointed out for models that are able to compress information using a smaller data set <ref> [Lee91] </ref>. Here, we are interested in building a multiresolution approximation of such a sampled surface through a piecewise-linear HTS, having its vertices either at the nodes or on edges of the grid. <p> each triangle t 2 T , the open circumcircle of t does not contain any point of V in its interior [Pre85]. 28 The problem of approximating a sampled surface at a given precision " &gt; 0 through a PLTS has been studied by several authors in the literature (see <ref> [Lee91] </ref> for a survey). Different heuristics have been proposed to extract a "small" number of vertices (and triangles) that are sufficient to achieve precision ".

Reference-contexts: Quaternary triangulations of plane domains have been widely used as domain partitions for surface representation [Gom79, Bar84], and for the finite element method [Ban86]; generalizations of such a partition scheme to spherical domains have been used for various applications <ref> [Fek84, Dyn90, Pot90, Goo92] </ref>. The ternary triangulation was proposed in [DeF84] as a hierarchical model for terrain description. In such a model, an initial triangle is recursively split into three subtriangles by joining its vertices with the internal data point at which the surface it approximated worst.

Reference-contexts: A triangulation of set V is a maximal plane straight-line graph G = (V; E), where E is a set of non-crossing line segments with endpoints in V <ref> [Pre85] </ref>. A triangulation of V can be expressed as a triple t = (V; E; T ), where T is the set of triangular faces induced by G on the plane. <p> refinement strategy adopted to select its vertices. 3 The Delaunay triangulation of a set of points V is a triangulation t = (V; E; T ) such that for each triangle t 2 T , the open circumcircle of t does not contain any point of V in its interior <ref> [Pre85] </ref>. 28 The problem of approximating a sampled surface at a given precision " &gt; 0 through a PLTS has been studied by several authors in the literature (see [Lee91] for a survey).

Reference-contexts: Smooth surfaces over triangulations can be obtained by using one among the numerous methods developed in the literature (see, e.g., <ref> [Ren84, Far86, Sei92] </ref>). Since adjacent portions of the domain are refined independently in the hierarchical triangulation, it is our intent to investigate further the relation between the matching property of hierarchical triangulations and the smoothness of the surface across adjacent patches.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical triangulations, the data structures for encoding them, and the algorithms for their construction and analysis are very general, and can be applied to build different hierarchical models for specific applications. The Delaunay triangulation, which we adopted in our model, has some desirable properties (e.g., minimal roughness <ref> [Rip90] </ref>) that make it suitable for many applications.

Reference-contexts: Neighbor finding can be implemented on the basis of the data structure just described, through suitable algorithms, similar to the well known algorithms for neighbor finding on quadtrees <ref> [Sam90] </ref>. The main principle adopted by such techniques is the following. The hierarchy is traversed bottom-up starting at t, until an ancestor of t is found, having the corresponding ancestor of e as an internal edge. <p> Such links are called ropes, for analogy with similar data structures proposed for quadtrees <ref> [Sam90] </ref>. According to the above discussion, in case there exist more than one admissible neighbor for triangle t, the rope will connect e to the triangle t 0 among candidate neighbors, which lies at the highest level in the hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: This undesirable feature was partially overcome by a heuristic hierarchical triangulation proposed in <ref> [Sca92] </ref>, where the splitting rule permits introducing new points either inside and/or on the border of a triangle. The Delaunay pyramid described in [DeF89] is a multiresolution triangle-based model whose structure is completely different from all models described above. <p> In order to preserve the possibility for local refinements, heuristic techniques have been proposed that permit the refinement of some edges while leaving some other edges unchanged. In <ref> [Sca92] </ref> an error-driven splitting rule has been proposed, which implements a hybrid strategy: a triangle t is refined by inserting points corresponding to the maximum approximation errors along its edges and/or in its interior. <p> Splitting of triangles is performed iteratively within a given triangulation t until the precision required for the given degree of resolution is met. The heuristic hierarchical triangulation proposed in <ref> [Sca92] </ref> is built based on a decreasing sequence of tolerance values " 0 &gt; " 1 &gt; : : : &gt; " d max , like the Delaunay pyramid described in Section 2.
