Title: PARALLEL ACTIVITY ROADMAPS

Abstract: Parallel Roadmaps are simple visual constructs, useful for displaying the evolution of large-scale parallel programs with dynamic parallelism. Roadmaps remain intelligible and provide invaluable debugging clues even as program complexity increases. A key design feature is the selective omission of details to be displayed, coupled with the option to focus on part of the program to obtain additional details. Keywords: massive parallelism, monitoring, debugging, animation.

Reference-contexts: They can exist in a certain PE (processing element), be suspended, restart running, spawn children, or even migrate to other PEs. In our system, parallel programs are written in ParC, a parallel version of C <ref> [1] </ref>. Activities are defined by the blocks of a parblock construct, or by the iterations of a parfor, which are executable in parallel. These are closed constructs based on the parbegin/parend paradigm.
