Abstract: Conventional Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) do not acknowledge uncertainty about the student's knowledge. Yet, both the outcome of any teaching intervention and the exact state of the student's knowledge are uncertain. In recent years, researchers have made startling progress in the management of uncertainty in knowledge-based systems. Building on these developments, we describe an ITS architecture that explicitly models uncertainty. This will facilitate more accurate student modeling and provide ITS's which can learn.

Reference-contexts: In later work we will use a rule-based instructional strategy model based on solid instructional design principles (Dick and Carey 1990; Gagne et al. 1988). The idea of using general knowledge-based systems to control a Bayesian network has much in common with 10 "knowledge-based model construction" <ref> (Breese et al. 1991, Madigan 1993) </ref>. This very recent approach aims to build knowledge-based systems which dynamically construct and control probabilistic models to reason with uncertainty during consultations.

Reference-contexts: These models are also known as Bayesian networks or belief networks and have become well established as an effective method for representing knowledge and managing uncertainty in expert systems <ref> (Charniak 1991) </ref>. The key component of a graphical model is a graph with nodes representing random variables and links (either directed or undirected) indicating influence or possibly causality.

Reference-contexts: These probabilities will be subject to further constraints since the graphical model implies A and C are conditionally independent given B. Efficient algorithms are available for graphical models which exploit the graphical structure to rapidly calculate conditional probabilities <ref> (see for example, Dawid 1992) </ref>. Thus for example we can efficiently calculate the probability that a student known to have facet A, also has facet C. The probabilistic model is specified by a probability distribution for each node, conditional on its direct influences 2 .

Reference-contexts: Facet identification is central to the development of a Vital ITS. The idea is to identify all the concepts and misconceptions that students have about the target domain. Hunt and Minstrell have developed a facet identification process in the context of high school physics <ref> (Hunt and Minstrell 1993) </ref> which we have successfully applied to a number of modules of an introductory college-level statistics course. Here we sketch the basic structure. Step 1 Assemble a group of target domain education experts and draft a list of facets for the modules being developed.

Reference-contexts: In the future, more education will be directed towards the existing work force, as well as special groups such as the long-term unemployed and the disabled. Much of the learning that will go on in the future will necessarily be concerned with complexity, thereby enlarging the challenge <ref> (Kay 1991) </ref>. fl Department of Statistics, GN-22, University of Washington, Seattle WA 98195 (madigan@stat.washington.edu) 1 Computing can play a significant role in meeting that challenge: "the computer is a cognitive tool for learning, an augmenter of intelligent study. <p> Once students are enfranchised as explorers, computers can serve as powerful amplifiers extending the reach and depth of learners" <ref> (Kay 1991) </ref>. This potential, however, has yet to be fully exploited. Traditional Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) presents instructional material in a rigid treelike structure. All possible paths through the system are conceived of, and programmed by the designer.

Reference-contexts: Data was gathered in a post-instruction test of 166 students at Mercer Island High School in Washington State during the 1989-90 school year. The students were instructed by James Minstrell and his colleagues in accord with Minstrell's instructional framework <ref> (Minstrell and Stimpson 1990) </ref>. The model selected by the Occam's Window algorithm for this data is shown in Figure 3. The corresponding observed frequency tables are provided in the appendix. A striking feature of the selected model is the importance of facets G and Q.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the second component of the teaching model concerns instructional strategy | how to schedule teaching operators to have the desired effect on the state of the domain model. This distinction between instructional strategy and teaching operators mirrors that between the macro and micro levels of the MAIS system <ref> (Tennyson and Christensen 1984) </ref>. In MAIS the responsibility of the curriculum (macro) model is to establish diagnostic scenarios for prescribing the conditions of instruction to be used at the instructional (micro) level. Vassileva (1992) presents essentially the same idea.
