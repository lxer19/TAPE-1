Title: Splitting a Default Theory

Address: Austin, TX 78712-1188, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at Austin  
Abstract: This paper presents mathematical results that can sometimes be used to simplify the task of reasoning about a default theory, by "splitting it into parts." These so-called Splitting Theorems for default logic are related in spirit to "partial evaluation" in logic programming, in which results obtained from one part of a program are used to simplify the remainder of the program. In this paper we focus primarily on the statement and proof of the Splitting Theorems for default logic. We illustrate the usefulness of the results by applying them to an example default theory for commonsense reasoning about action.

Reference-contexts: Example: Splitting a Default Theory for Reasoning About Action We will illustrate the use of the Splitting Sequence Theorem by applying it to a default theory that formalizes commonsense knowledge about actions. The action domain we formalize is based on the "Soup Bowl" example from <ref> (Baral & Gelfond 1993) </ref>, which involves reasoning about the effects of concurrent actions. 6 The default logic formalization we consider relies, implicitly, on the notion of "static causal laws," recently investigated in (McCain & Turner 1995; Turner 1996).

Reference-contexts: Theorems are related somewhat, in spirit, to "partial evaluation" in logic programming, in which results obtained from one part of a program are used to simplify the remainder of the program. 1 In fact, the Splitting Theorems for default logic closely resemble the Splitting Theorems for logic programming introduced in <ref> (Lifschitz & Turner 1994) </ref>, despite complications due to the presence of arbitrary formulas in default theories. 2 Similar results for autoepistemic logic can be found in (Gel-fond & Przymusinska 1992).
