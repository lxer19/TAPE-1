Title: Reasoning in Description Logics  
Author: F. M. Donini, M. Lenzerini, D. Nardi, A. Schaerf 
Abstract: Description Logics stem from Semantic Networks and Frames. They deal with the representation of structured concepts, and reasoning with them. The structure of a concept is described using a language, called concept language, comprising boolean operators (conjunction, disjunction, negation) and various forms of quantification over the attributes (or, roles) of the given concept. A noticeable difference with other structuring formalisms is that also roles can be given some internal structure, e.g. a role can be expressed as a conjunction of two other roles. We survey techniques for reasoning, and computational complexity of reasoning problems in Description Logics, referring to four different settings: 1) reasoning with plain concept expressions; 2) reasoning with instances of concepts; 3) reasoning with axioms expressing properties of concepts; 4) reasoning with both instances of concepts and axioms. In the end of the paper, we mention important aspects of De scription Logics not dealt within this survey.

Reference-contexts: One attempt to providing a formal ground to Semantic Networks and Frames led to the development of the system kl-one (Brachman and Schmolze 1985). Subsequently, the research has gone further in this direction by providing systems with an explicit model-theoretic semantics <ref> (see for example the system omega, Attardi and Simi 1981) </ref>. More recently, KR systems based on Description Logics (or terminological systems), have been proposed as successors of kl-one, with the Tarskian semantics for first order logic.

Reference-contexts: We consider below the so-called descriptive semantics, which seems to be the most appropriate one, although it is not 8 Reasoning in Description Logics / 9 satisfactory in all cases <ref> (Baader 1990, Nebel 1991, De Giacomo and Lenz-erini 1994b, Schild 1994) </ref>. We refer to Section 5 for a discussion on cyclic statements and different semantics for the TBox. <p> Consider the following definition: A = 9CHILD.A (5) we can associate to it the operator: S:fa 2 I j 9b:(a; b) 2 CHILD I ^ b 2 Sg, for any interpretation I. In what follows, we write F () to denote such an operator. In <ref> (Baader 1990, Nebel 1991, De Giacomo and Lenzerini 1994a) </ref>, three ways of interpreting cyclic definitions are discussed, according to one of the following semantics: Descriptive Semantics. A : = F (A) is a constraint stating that A has to be some solution of the corresponding equation. <p> The computational properties of the three semantics are studied in <ref> (Baader 1990, Nebel 1991) </ref>. It turns out that, for the language FLN , Subsumption in cyclic TBoxes is PSPACE-complete with respect to both 36 Reasoning in Description Logics / 37 least and greatest fixpoint semantics.

For example, the system classic <ref> (Borgida et al. 1989) </ref> was designed taking into account the indications of the complexity analysis in the choice of the constructors included in the language. Secondly, the complexity results have been obtained by exploiting a general technique for Satisfiability checking in Description Logics.

Reference-contexts: The same algorithm can be extended up to the language ALN , with the same complexity. Similar normalize-and-compare algorithms are actually used in the systems classic <ref> (Borgida and Patel-Schneider 1994) </ref>, back (Quantz and Kin-dermann 1990), and loom (MacGregor 1994). However, all these algorithms are incomplete, if a standard semantics of concepts is assumed. This is due to interactions between constructors, which are not taken into account by structural comparisons. <p> Finally, we remark that results presented here for O are based on a standard first-order semantics. Semantics employed in actual systems can be a variant of pure first-order semantics <ref> (see e.g. Borgida and Patel-Schneider 1994) </ref>. However, there is no general agreement on whether such non-standard semantics are appropriate and understandable by users. 27 28 / F. M. Donini, M. Lenzerini, D. Nardi, A. <p> Another approach to the characterization of reasoning methods is to look at existing implementations and then try to characterize the computations done by the system, possibly using a non-standard semantics <ref> (Borgida and Patel-Schneider 1994) </ref>. Non-first-order features. The analysis developed in this paper was limited to deal with the first-order formalization of knowledge representation systems based on classes, which means that we have addressed neither nonmonotonic nor behavioral features.

Reference-contexts: In the following we briefly mention some of the issues, which were outside the scope of this survey. Implementation issues. The implementation of DL-systems involves many other aspects besides the computational analysis of reasoning problems. Engineering of knowledge representation systems is illustrated for example in <ref> (Brachman 1992) </ref>. More specifically, with regard to the implementation of reasoning procedures, the tableaux-based reasoning techniques which we have considered in this survey should be equipped with specialized strategies for rule selection and application.
