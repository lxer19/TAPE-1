Abstract: This paper describes an implementation of a behavior-based mobile manipulator capable of autonomously transferring a sample from one drum to a second in unstructured environments. A major contribution of the project was the coherent integration of the arm and base as a cohesive unit, and not just a mobile base with an arm attached. The support for smooth simultaneous operation of all joints on the vehicle facilitated biologically plausible motions, such as arm preshaping. The behavior-based controller used a pseudo-force model, where behaviors add forces and torques to joints and limbs resulting in coordinated motion. The vehicle Jacobian is used to convert the pseudo-forces into joint torques and a pseudo-damping model converts the joint torques into joint velocities. This process allows rapid control of the manipulator without the use of inverse kinematics. A drum sampling task is presented where the vehicle demonstrates how a sample of material could be moved from one drum to another, illustrating the efficacy of the solution.

Reference-contexts: The basic premise is to guide the motion of the arm and base by responding to artificial forces generated by concurrent active behaviors. Conventional two dimensional reactive methodologies (e.g., subsumption-based architectures [9], REX [15], RAPs [12], schema-based systems [5], and many others <ref> [1, 13, 18] </ref>) have been extended to three dimensions. Related work by Connell in mobile manipulation [11] differs in that in his approach the arm and base are treated separately from a behavioral perspective, i.e, the arm inhibits the base's motion during reaching and grasping.

Reference-contexts: A primary goal of the project was development of an integrated mobile manipulator, not just an arm mounted on a mobile base. This goal grew out of the desire to support biologically plausible motions <ref> [2] </ref>, such as arm preshaping, and grasping while moving. Preshaping refers to the process of forming the arm into the configuration necessary to acquire a target as the robot begins to close on the target.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, a drum sampling task is presented where the vehicle demonstrates how a sample of material could be moved from one drum to a second. This task integrates our work in temporal sequencing <ref> [3] </ref> with our research in visual tracking [19] and visual servoing [17]. Images taken from a robot waist camera are processed using a constrained, line-based Hough transform [19, 14] to recognize and localize the drums in natural settings using a stored model. <p> The process is then repeated for the second drum to show how additional samples could be collected. Finally, the vehicle halts after finishing with the second drum. The behavioral configuration which implements this drum sampling task uses two levels of temporal sequenced coordination <ref> [3] </ref> to control execution of the various stages of the mission.

Reference-contexts: The mobile manipulator incorporates a route planner <ref> [6] </ref> for utilizing a priori map information in partially modeled environments. However, for these experiments, the planner was not used. Instead, the robot was provided with rough estimates of the locations of the drums relative to its starting location.
