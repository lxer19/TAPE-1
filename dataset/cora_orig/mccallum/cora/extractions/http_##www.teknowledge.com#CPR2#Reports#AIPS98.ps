Abstract: The Core Plan Representation (Pease 1997) is a schema for the representation of plan information which is independent of any particular method of plan construction. It has been developed as an ontology and implemented as an object oriented design. Now in its second phase, the generic plan design has been specialized for several areas of military planning the Warplan. This specialization and implementation is now undergoing examination as a possible foundation for several new DARPA projects. ongoing area of active research. This paper presents the current state of the Core Plan Representation and shares

Reference-contexts: Because the harmonization with ACP had already taken place and because the JFACC design was also an object oriented design, the harmonization with JFACC was much easier than with ACP. Intelligence Planning The Intelligence portion of the Warplan is a harmonization of CPR with the work of <ref> (Albericci 1997) </ref>. This work adds thrity one objects to CPR. Significant areas of addition include subclassing of Action to cover the five phases of intelligence operations: direction, collection, processing, production and dissemination. In addition, significant sublcasses were created for resource types and roles.

Reference-contexts: A reader who is interested in the broad history of planning and plan representation is referred to (Tate et al 1990), (Allen et al 1990), and (Zweben & Fox 1994). Several efforts have significantly influenced the CPR. The planning representation of KRSL <ref> (Lehrer 1993) </ref> bears many similarities to CPR. In fact, some of the same people working on KRSL-Plans have contributed significantly to the CPR design. The goals of the two efforts are slightly different however.

Reference-contexts: While KRSL-Plans is working on developing an ontology of plans and activities, CPR is striving for an object oriented software design developed with a strong ontological awareness. It should be noted that KRSL-Plans, like CPR, is also an ongoing effort, although it began much earlier. &lt;I-N-OVA&gt; <ref> (Tate 1996) </ref> is another ongoing effort which bears some similarity to CPR due to the significant contribution of Austin Tate to the CPR effort. Another important related effort is the Process Interchange Format (Lee 1996). Many projects are now converging.

Reference-contexts: Many projects are now converging. The NIST Process Specification Language (Schlenoff, et al 1997) is an effort in plan representation for manufacturing. The CPR has been one of the inputs to this representation. The DARPA Shared Planning and Action Representation (SPAR 1997), <ref> (Tate 1998) </ref> has been an additional effort by the DARPA research community in this area. CPR is the object oriented representation and reference implementation for SPAR. Under the DARPA High Performance Knowledge Bases project, CPR will be part of the Teknowledge-Cycorp knowledge base derived from Cyc (Lenat 1997).

Reference-contexts: Warplan Specialization The Warplan adds three specializations to this core: Intelligence Planning, Operations and Logistics. Operations This design specializes the CPR for military operations planning. The first step was to harmonize the design with a grammar for Air Campaign Planning Objectives <ref> (Valente 1996) </ref>. Sixteen objects specific to ACP were added to CPR. This harmonization was quite interesting for several reasons. First, the ACP grammar was written in LOOM (MacGregor, 1996) and the CPR uses UML (Rational, 1997). Harmonizing such different paradigms of knowledge coding required considerable explanation by each author.
