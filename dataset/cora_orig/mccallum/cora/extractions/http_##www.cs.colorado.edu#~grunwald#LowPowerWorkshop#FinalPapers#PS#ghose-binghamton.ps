Abstract: Organizational techniques for reducing energy dissipation in on-chip processor caches as well as off-chip caches have been observed to provide substantial energy savings in a technology independent manner. We propose and evaluate the use of block buffering using multiple block buffers, subbanking and bit line isolation to reduce the power dissipation within on-chip caches for superscalar CPUs. We use a detailed register-level superscalar simulator to glean transition counts that occur within various cache components during the execution of SPEC 95 benchmarks. These transition counts are fed into an energy dissipation model for a 0.8 micron cache to allow power dissipation within various cache components to be estimated accurately. We show that the use of 4 block buffers, with subbanking and bit line isolation can reduce the energy dissipation of conventional caches very significantly, often by as much as 60-70%.

Reference-contexts: These include bit line isolation techniques that isolate the sense amp from the bit lines once the sense amp has started making a transition, as used in the Hitachi SH-3 embedded microprocessor <ref> [HKY+ 95] </ref>, clamped bit lines that limit bit line swings and other similar techniques. 3) Instruction scheduling techniques that schedules instructions in a manner that reduces power dissipation in instruction caches [SuDe 95]. <p> Considerable energy savings thus results. Bit line isolation has been used to reduce the power dissipation in the cache memory of the Hitachi SH-3 embedded microprocessor <ref> [HKY+ 95] </ref>. To achieve further savings on the bit line energy, the data arrays can be subdivided into subbanks, so that only those subbanks that contain the desired data can be readout [SuDe 95, KaGh 97a]. A subbank consists of a number of consecutive bit columns of the data array.

These techniques can be divided into the following categories: 1) Techniques that use alternative cache organizations for reducing cache power dissipation.

In Section 2, we describe the energy efficient architectural techniques such as block buffering, subbanking, multiple block buffers and bit-line isolation. These are elaborated in earlier papers <ref> [KaGh 97a, KaGh97b, GhKa 98] </ref>. In Section 3, we elaborate on the experimental setup used for our measurements. The energy dissipations for the proposed cache configurations, as obtained from the simulated execution of SPEC 95 benchmarks are discussed in Section 4. The main conclusions are given in Section 5. <p> To achieve further savings on the bit line energy, the data arrays can be subdivided into subbanks, so that only those subbanks that contain the desired data can be readout <ref> [SuDe 95, KaGh 97a] </ref>. A subbank consists of a number of consecutive bit columns of the data array. A data line is thus spread across a number of subbanks. The size of a subbank refers to the physical word width of each subbank.

Reference-contexts: Multiple line buffers simply increase the probability of aborting the tag and data array accesses, so that bit line dissipations during the array readout are avoided. In <ref> [KGM 97] </ref>, Kin et al describe the use of a small filter cache that sits in front of a conventional L1 cache for reducing the power dissipation of the cache memory system. If a hit occurs in the smaller filter cache, data is accessed from the filter cache.

Reference-contexts: is due to the primary caches. (c) A recently announced low-power microprocessor targeted for the low power, the DEC SA-110, medium performance market (that also leads all microprocessors available today in terms of SPECmarks/watt) dissipates 27% and 16% of the total power, respectively, in the on-chip I-cache and D-cache respectively <ref> [Mon 96] </ref>. As yet another example, the HP PA 8500 is significantly cache-rich compared to other similar high-end microprocessors and reportedly more than 70% of its die area is occupied by the on-chip L1 caches, which are likely to be a major source of power dissipation.

Reference-contexts: The main conclusions are given in Section 5. The Appendix summarizes the energy dissipation model of the set associative caches. 2. Organizing Caches for Energy Efficiency The most common cache organization employed in modern microprocessors today is the set-associative cache <ref> [Smith 82] </ref>; the direct-mapped cache and fully associative cache organizations are two extremes of the set-associative organization. In a normal m-way set associative cache, there are m tag and data array pairs, each consisting of S rows, where S = 2 s .

Reference-contexts: These transition counts are then fed into an energy dissipation model for the major cache components [KaGh 97b, KaGh98], with capacitative coefficients obtained from <ref> [WiJo 94] </ref> for a real cache implementation, to determine the energy dissipations are realistically as possible. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the energy efficient architectural techniques such as block buffering, subbanking, multiple block buffers and bit-line isolation. <p> We assume the layout and technology parameters for the 0.8m cache described in detail in <ref> [WiJo 94] </ref>. The superscalar pipeline implements the MIPS 3000 ISA. The out-of-order execution engine uses a register update unit (RUU) which maintains the program order of the instructions to retire completed instructions. <p> The L3 cache is always maintained as a conventional cache with base case configuration. For the purpose of this paper, we used the capacitances for the 0.8 micron CMOS cache described in <ref> [WiJo 94] </ref>. A supply voltage of V dd = 5 Volts was assumed. The voltage swing on the bit lines was limited to 500mV on each side of V precharge which was assumed to be V dd /2. <p> The CPU pipeline (and the caches) was (were) assumed to be clocked at 120 MHz. The 0.8m pipelined cache used for the case study can sustain this clock rate for a wide range of cache sizes based on the timings reported in <ref> [WiJo 94] </ref> where the cache was not pipelined. The L2 cache is operated at half this frequency. 4. Results and Discussions Figures 3 and 4 depict how the power dissipation varies across the SPEC 95 benchmarks for a conventionally organized L1 I-cache and a conventionally organized L1 D-cache.
