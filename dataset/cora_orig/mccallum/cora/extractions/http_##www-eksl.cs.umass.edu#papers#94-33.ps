Abstract: We seek explanatory models of how and why AI systems work in particular environments. We are not satisfied to demonstrate performance, we want to understand it. In terms of data and models, this means we are not satisfied with descriptive summaries, nor even with predictive models. We want causal models. In this brief abstract we will present descriptive, predictive and causal models of the behavior of agents that fight simulated forest fires. We will describe the shortcomings of descriptive and predictive models, and summarize path analysis, a common technique for inducing causal models.

Reference-contexts: Legal paths are those that don't visit a node more than once, don't follow arrows backward after they have gone forward, and don't include more than one undirected arc (see <ref> [Asher 83] </ref>;[Li 75]; [Loehlin 87]; [Cohen 94] for details). For example, the estimated correlation between wind speed and shutdown time is (:183)(:287) + (:183)(:843)(:506) + (:491)(:506) + (:172)(:219)(:506) + (:172)(:432)(:287) + (:172)(:432)(:843)(:506) = :089. We have already seen that the empirical correlation between wind speed and shutdown time is -.053.

Reference-contexts: 1 Phoenix Phoenix is a simulated environment populated by autonomous agents. It is a simulation of forest fires in Yellowstone National Park and the agents that fight the fires <ref> [Cohen et al. 89] </ref>. Agents include watchtowers, fuel trucks, helicopters, bulldozers and, coordinating (but not controlling) the efforts of all, a fireboss. Fires burn in unpredictable ways due to wind speed and direction, terrain and elevation, fuel type and moisture content, and natural boundaries such as rivers, roads and lakes.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm relies on the pruning process, in particular on the limitations on branching factor and the number of edges, to reduce these calculations to polynomial time. 4.1 Illustration of PA The PA algorithm has been tested with artificial data <ref> [Cohen et al. 93] </ref> and also with the Phoenix dataset. We are currently conducting a study in which it is compared with Pearl's algorithm [Pearl and Verma 91] and the TETRAD II algorithm [Spirtes et al. 93]. We are also improving the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: sighting to the return to base of the last bulldozer, required to contain the fire. 2.1 Descriptive models We wanted to know how these factors interacted; specifically, we wanted to know how success and shutdown time depended on the other factors. (We will focus on shutdown time, here, but see <ref> [Hart and Cohen 92] </ref>). A descriptive model is simply a correlation matrix of the factors. We don't recommend this kind of model. <p> It is also unparsimonious, as described in <ref> [Hart and Cohen 92] </ref>. 3 Causal path models Path analysis is an exploratory modeling technique that has helped us incrementally develop a causal understanding of Phoenix.

Reference-contexts: One way to run a path analysis is to specify a path model and see how well data fit it; another approach is to let the data suggest path models. The latter approach is causal induction, similar to the work of <ref> [Pearl and Verma 91] </ref>, and [Spirtes et al. 93]. An algorithm is described later. Here, let us focus on the former approach, where the analyst specifies a path model. Figure 2 is a model we derived from the experiment described above. <p> We are currently conducting a study in which it is compared with Pearl's algorithm <ref> [Pearl and Verma 91] </ref> and the TETRAD II algorithm [Spirtes et al. 93]. We are also improving the algorithm. Thus, detailed evaluation of PA is forthcoming, and this section must be read more as an illustration than an evaluation.

We ran PA on a subset of the Phoenix dataset, leaving out wind speed and fireboss utilization.
