Title: Information Agents for Building Hyperlinks

Abstract: In [13] we describe an architecture for building special-purpose agents for solving the information capture and access problem in large, multi-media data environments with uncertainty in data representation and interpretation. The key idea is to recognize the underlying structure that exists at various levels of granularity in such environments, and to use it to build partial models (that can serve as indices) which encode information about content. In this paper we apply this computational paradigm to create and maintain a rich hierarchy of indices that link documents in an electronic repository of technical reports (TR) located over a wide-area network. We describe issues in the acquisition and use of these indices in answering a wide range of queries in the TR data environment.

Reference-contexts: These requests can be handled by structure detectors that can identify higher-level entities like tables and photographs. Yet another example is the query "find a mechanism that converts a uniform rotary motion into a reciprocation in Artobelovsky's design encyclopedia <ref> [2] </ref>". Paper encyclopedias are typically indexed by the component types in the mechanism, and not by behavior.

Reference-contexts: Based on the tools used for discovering similarity between various pieces of the documents, the information agents build three types of hyperlinks: layout, content, and mixed. Layout links are computed by geometric matching algorithms, like testing for the similarity of two polygons by using the Hausdorff metric <ref> [8] </ref>. Content similarity between two blocks of text can be computed by using text retrieval systems like Smart. In [1] a method for automatically generating a graphs that represents similarity between documents is presented. This graph can serve as input to graph-theoretic algorithms that select subgraphs with certain desirable properties. <p> Information agents compute the layout links efficiently by starting from indices of the requested type. For instance, papers with similar polygonal structures can be found by creating an agent with the index of type "polygon" as the top-level navigator, and by using the Hausdorff distance matching algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> as top-level structure detector.

Reference-contexts: We are inspired by research in four distinct areas: information retrieval and filtering [1, 3, 14, 16], mobile robotics [4, 5], knowbots as proposed in [10], and automated document structuring [18, 6, 11]. 2 Information Agents Our approach to information capture and access <ref> [13] </ref> is to decompose the problem into recognition of high-level structure and traversal of portions of the data environment that exhibit this structure. As an example, consider the retrieval of precision recall measures for specific collections (such as the CACM) from a scanned set of technical reports on information retrieval. <p> This approach to Information Capture and Access bears a strong similarity to the search of physical environments by mobile robots. Structure detectors are virtual sensors and navigators are virtual effectors. More specifically, an information agent is a tree of structure detectors and navigators glued together by communication paths <ref> [13] </ref>, as in Figure 1. The root of the tree is a structure detector for the user's query. We view the query as a request for detecting and retrieving some specific structure from the world. The tree consists of alternating layers of structure detectors and navigators. <p> The section-oriented partition is unsuitable for queries of the form: "retrieve the paper in the TR repository with a picture of the mobot Tommy in the right-hand corner of the second page." Partitioning the data environment is actually described as computing topologies <ref> [13] </ref>. The bitmapped representation of the documents forms the base of an information lattice. The elements in the lattice are subsets of the base data environment. The sections of the document are subsets of the base bitmap and they form a partition of the bitmap. <p> Similarly, papers across the Internet that contain pictures of mobile robots can be collected by creating an agent with the index of type "photograph" as the top-level structure detector <ref> [13] </ref>, and by using vision algorithms to recognize given robots in a photograph. 4.2 Content Hyperlinks The content hyperlinks are detected by information agents whose structure detectors retrieve and recognize similarity in text blocks. <p> For instance, a clique in the similarity graph calculated at the paragraph-level, where all the edges have a very high weight identifies duplication in a collection of documents on the same topic. Information agents compute the content hyperlinks by first employing the Bib agent described in <ref> [13] </ref> to find all the papers on a given topic in the distributed repository of technical reports. This data set is filtered by a Smart structure detector [1] whose results (returned in the form of a graph) are further processed by a structure detector that recognizes interesting subgraphs. <p> A section-level navigator constructs the appropriate partition for these structure detectors. We can compose this agent with the Bib agent in <ref> [13] </ref> that retrieves papers from the Internet given a full reference for them. The same ideas can be used to link a theorem reference to its statement and to its proof.
