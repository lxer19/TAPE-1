Abstract: AT&T Labs Research Technical Report #97.23.1 14 April 1997 Abstract The AT&T Internet Difference Engine (aide) is a system that finds and displays changes to pages on the World Wide Web. The system consists of several components, including a web-crawler that detects changes, an archive of past versions of pages, a tool called HtmlDiff to highlight changes between versions of a page, and a graphical interface to view the relationship between pages over time. This paper describes aide, with an emphasis on the evolution of the system and experiences with it. It also raises some sociological and legal issues.

Reference-contexts: Of course, as discussed above in Section 3.3, versions provided by a content provider may not have an appropriate granularity for aide.

Reference-contexts: Entity-Relationship Database Ciao uses an "abstractor" to convert different forms of data into an internal representation that can be graphed. Each abstractor is specific to a domain, such as C program source or HTML. The internal representation is an Entity-Relationship <ref> [3] </ref> database that can be processed by CQL [13]. In the case of HTML, each entity is a www page or one of a set of tags within a page, such as anchors and images.

Reference-contexts: Forms, Java and Javascript Just as aide does not recursively follow images to determine if a page has changed, it does not handle forms using POST, nor applets or other embedded objects. (In fact, the Java applet security model <ref> [6] </ref> suggests that if aide archives or marks up a page, serving it from a different site from the original, its applets may be inaccessible.) Executable content that is embedded within a page is treated like any other content.

Reference-contexts: In any event, modifying HtmlDiff to use frames to display the old and new versions side-by-side (as Web Integrity does [19]) rather than marking up the new version should avoid the "derivative work" issue completely. Finally, one can examine other systems, such as the Internet Archive [22] and DejaNews <ref> [7] </ref>, which perform similar functions. The Internet Archive relies on users to deny access explicitly, via a robots.txt file [27], if they do not want their content archived.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, deletions are unlikely to appear in a "what's new" page or to be highlighted within a page, even though deletions are often as interesting as changes or insertions. The AT&T Internet Difference Engine (aide) provides a personalized view of how pages on the www change <ref> [9] </ref>. It uses a centralized notification system, version archive, and differencing tool to allow users to track and view changes to arbitrary pages on the www. It also supports recursive tracking and differencing of a page and its descendants, and graphical viewing of the relationships between these pages [10]. <p> We discuss archival in the next subsection; here we focus on a new tool we developed, called HtmlDiff <ref> [9] </ref>, which performs the latter function. It takes two versions of a page as input and produces a new syntactically correct HTML page that highlights the differences between the two pages.

This paper describes aide and reports experiences with it. The next section provides a taxonomy of notification systems with respect to several important criteria. Section 3 describes the architecture of the system and discusses its components. <p> Recursive Differencing HtmlDiff was later modified to support recursive differencing: when displaying the differences in a page, one can follow a special link inserted by HtmlDiff to see the differences in the linked page as of approximately the same points in time as the versions of the current page <ref> [10] </ref>. HtmlDiff queries the database (see below) to determine which linked pages have versions available to compare recursively. <p> of a page directly from the output of HtmlDiff .) A percent sign (%) is used to indicate an anchor that does not have two versions available, in which case clicking on the percent sign leads to the current version of the page, marked up to itself support recursive comparisons <ref> [10] </ref>. Figure 3 gives an example of recursive differencing. Experiences After using HtmlDiff at length, several things became apparent. Generally, HtmlDiff has been effective at highlighting the subtle changes that previously went unnoticed: for example, a professor's home page when "Assistant Professor" changes to "Associate Professor" upon receiving tenure. <p> We discuss the implications of copyright protection on archival below in Section 5.1. 3.4 Graphical Navigation The Web Graphical User Interface to a Difference Engine, or Webguide, uses WebCiao [5], the www version of the Ciao graphical navigator [4] to browse relationships between pages <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Thanks also to the many people within AT&T and Lucent Technologies who used the system and provided feedback.

While this support applies to collaborative environments in which people update a common base of pages on a server, it could be extended to allow servers to provide multiple versions and clients such as aide to request specific versions rather than archiving them themselves.

Reference-contexts: The latter data were kept in peruser flat files, as described in Section 3.3, which became expensive to reparse each time. While we could have moved to a hashing package (e.g., from 4.4BSD [28]), we chose instead to use the Daytona RDBMS <ref> [14] </ref>. The database stores data on a per-URL and per-user basis.

Reference-contexts: If a page hasn't changed in a month, perhaps checking it daily is overkill. The time-based protocols used for cache consistency <ref> [15] </ref> are especially applicable for tracking modifications for individual users. * The form to edit all URLs at once is an HTML table, so that columns are aligned.

Reference-contexts: It does this by archiving pages, either automatically or on demand, and then comparing a later version to an archived one using a derivative of Hirschberg's solution to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem <ref> [16] </ref> (adapted to HTML). These components of the system are discussed in detail in the following section. 3 System Architecture They may specify a number of operations, including: * register a URL to track, including the degree of recursion through links to other pages; Douglis, et al. <p> In the paragraph-to-list example, the comparison would show no change to content, but a change to the formatting. We apply Hirschberg's solution to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem <ref> [16] </ref> (with several speed optimizations) to compare HTML documents. This is the well-known comparison algorithm used by the UNIX diff utility [18]. The LCS problem is to find a (not necessarily contiguous) common subsequence of two sequences of tokens that has the longest length (or greatest Douglis, et al. <p> Therefore, it is possible to align the new markup "incorrectly," as in Figure 4: while one can make a case for highlighting the insertions across lines, it would appear that the new line was inserted as a unit. (Note that this is a well-known problem with the LCS algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>.) Another issue arises from HtmlDiff 's stripping the HTML from text that has been deleted, since structured text such as table entries will be output as a single linear text stream. For instance, Figure 2 shows the Douglis, et al.

Reference-contexts: Douglis, et al. AT&T Labs Research Technical Report #97.23.1 The AT&T Internet Difference Engine 5 Web Integrity <ref> [19] </ref> is not a notification tool; instead, it is a collection of tools to maintain www servers and content. It may be used by www server administrators and others to view a history of pages served and to see a side-by-side representation of the differences between them. <p> Unfortunately, at the time HtmlDiff was first implemented, there was no good mechanism that allowed such synchronization. Subsequently, support for frames has offered the opportunity to display the changes in this fashion, and at least one tool|Web Integrity, from Mortice Kern Systems, Inc. (MKS)|now provides this sort of comparison <ref> [19] </ref>. We have not yet implemented side-by-side comparison in HtmlDiff . Only Differences Show only differences (old and new) and eliminate the common part (as done in UNIX diff). This optimizes for the "common" case, where there is much in common between the documents. <p> From that history one could view a specific version or (once HtmlDiff was available) see the differences between a pair of versions. MKS's Web Integrity now provides similar functionality <ref> [19] </ref>. Using an archive provided by a content provider would not be suited to aide, for a number of reasons: * Most importantly, few content providers support this functionality. * If they did, the granularity of "check-in" by the owner of a page might not match the frequency of viewing. <p> Again, there may be a distinction between a service that highlights the changes and individuals who do so for personal use. In any event, modifying HtmlDiff to use frames to display the old and new versions side-by-side (as Web Integrity does <ref> [19] </ref>) rather than marking up the new version should avoid the "derivative work" issue completely. Finally, one can examine other systems, such as the Internet Archive [22] and DejaNews [7], which perform similar functions.

Reference-contexts: Second, the mode of data transfer is shifting to a bimodal "push-pull" model in which some data is pushed to users rather than being pulled by them upon request <ref> [20] </ref>. The "push" phenomenon is partially an outgrowth of the scale of the Internet, since it permits services to get the attention of users asynchronously rather than waiting for the users to return on their own. It is also well-suited to transient data, such as stock quotes, headlines, and weather. <p> All such services check for updates asynchronously, and make changes known to users either via email or by reporting changed pages over the www upon user request. One could envision integrating notification with other push-based technology such as Pointcast <ref> [20] </ref>, notifying users via a separate push-based application rather than email or the www. While server-based tools have the benefit of amortizing the overhead of tracking popular pages, with one HTTP access per URL rather than one HTTP access per URL per user, they also have a few drawbacks. <p> might apply when access to the aide version repository is much faster than simply transferring the entire page to the client; this seems unlikely in general except for extremely slow links between the client and the proxy-caching server.) Third, notification about updates should be integrated with "push" technology like Point-cast <ref> [20] </ref>. Pointcast, or similar media, would provide a good intermediate step between email and user-initiated reports. 6 Applications aide has always been viewed as a system to permit individuals to track changes to pages of personal interest and to view the ways in which those pages change over time.

Reference-contexts: A number of tools are now available to assist users in keeping track of when pages of interest change. Generally these tools fall into two categories: centralized services that register interests in URLs from many users (e.g., URL-Minder [31], the Informant <ref> [21] </ref>), and tools that run on a The AT&T Internet Difference Engine 2 user's machine and will poll the URLs listed in local files such as bookmarks (e.g., Katipo [24], Surfbot [29], Smart Bookmarks [12]). <p> Section 4 reports on some lessons from our experience with the system, Section 5 discusses ongoing issues and extensions, and Section 6 describes a few additional applications of aide.

Reference-contexts: Additional issues and improvements are discussed below in Section 4.2. 3.3 Archival Archiving www pages serves several potential purposes. For instance, the Internet Archive is attempting to store a snapshot of the entire www that is freely accessible, consisting of terabytes of data <ref> [22] </ref>. Such an archive is intended for historical purposes, much like libraries archive paper documents for future generations, but is not well-suited to the relatively fine-grained access needed by aide: such a large system might revisit a page after weeks or months, not days. <p> In any event, modifying HtmlDiff to use frames to display the old and new versions side-by-side (as Web Integrity does [19]) rather than marking up the new version should avoid the "derivative work" issue completely. Finally, one can examine other systems, such as the Internet Archive <ref> [22] </ref> and DejaNews [7], which perform similar functions. The Internet Archive relies on users to deny access explicitly, via a robots.txt file [27], if they do not want their content archived.

Reference-contexts: Note however that server-based archives do have other benefits, particularly when used in conjunction with delta-based encoding schemes to ship updates to previously delivered data <ref> [23] </ref>. Thus aide archives pages itself, using RCS. By centralizing the repository, the system amortizes the storage overhead of storing the same or similar versions of pages for many users simultaneously. Pages may be archived upon request by a user, or automatically when a change is detected.

Reference-contexts: A more conservative approach would be to request that content providers explicitly grant permission to archive via a comment in an HTML document. The PICS protocol <ref> [25] </ref> may ultimately be used in this fashion as well. Explicit permission, however, returns to the same problem of requiring actions on the part of the content provider and therefore probably reducing the set of URLs available to the aide system by orders of magnitude.

While we could have moved to a hashing package (e.g., from 4.4BSD <ref> [28] </ref>), we chose instead to use the Daytona RDBMS [14]. The database stores data on a per-URL and per-user basis.

Reference-contexts: fall into two categories: centralized services that register interests in URLs from many users (e.g., URL-Minder [31], the Informant [21]), and tools that run on a The AT&T Internet Difference Engine 2 user's machine and will poll the URLs listed in local files such as bookmarks (e.g., Katipo [24], Surfbot <ref> [29] </ref>, Smart Bookmarks [12]).

Reference-contexts: For instance, they might use a version control system to record changes to their pages, including comments. Even before aide, we developed a CGI interface to permit users to see the revision history of a document, using the Revision Control System (RCS) <ref> [30] </ref>, as long as the CGI script resided on the same machine as the version repository and the RCS file for the document was in the same public area.

Reference-contexts: A number of tools are now available to assist users in keeping track of when pages of interest change. Generally these tools fall into two categories: centralized services that register interests in URLs from many users (e.g., URL-Minder <ref> [31] </ref>, the Informant [21]), and tools that run on a The AT&T Internet Difference Engine 2 user's machine and will poll the URLs listed in local files such as bookmarks (e.g., Katipo [24], Surfbot [29], Smart Bookmarks [12]). <p> Section 4 reports on some lessons from our experience with the system, Section 5 discusses ongoing issues and extensions, and Section 6 describes a few additional applications of aide.

Netmind, which runs the URL-minder service <ref> [31] </ref>, at one point announced a URL-minder-ignore tag. Text contained within the tag will not be compared by URL-minder, so content providers can voluntarily exclude such things as timestamps and hit counts from consideration.

Reference-contexts: Additional information might include: * The number of changes reported by HtmlDiff . * The number of links added or deleted. This might be especially useful when tracking pages that themselves enumerate other pages, such as in the www Virtual Library <ref> [32] </ref> or Yahoo [35]. The "Website News" pages described above do list information about changes to links. * The fraction of text that has been modified.

Reference-contexts: It then colors the nodes in the graph accordingly. Thus, recursion goes beyond other tools such as WebCopy <ref> [33] </ref>, which will retrieve a URL and its descendants, since it archives versions of each page separately and indicates when differences are available recursively. The basic mechanism for retrieving pages, parsing them, and retrieving their descendants is the same.
