Abstract: In this paper we determine the equilibrium distribution for a general class of Markov processes on a semi-infinite strip. We expose a method to express the equilibrium probabilities of the Markov process as a finite sum of terms, which are geometric in the unbounded variable. The geometric factors are the roots inside the unit circle of a determinantal equation. By using a generating-function technique we are able to determine these roots very efficiently. Because of this, the expression for the equilibrium probabilities becomes numerically very attractive.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the balance equations can be solved recursively, from level s down to level 0. An example of such a Markov process can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. The analysis is similar in case A (1) &gt; 0 and D (1) = 0. If both A (1) and D (1) are zero, then the Markov process remains at the same level on the strip (it can only move to another level via the states in V ).

Reference-contexts: The rate matrix R is the minimal nonnegative solution of a nonlinear matrix equation. It is well-known that the determination of R may cause numerical problems, cf. <ref> [7] </ref>. Clearly, when R is diagonizable, the factors x m in the form (1) are the eigenvalues of R and the vectors y m are the associated eigenvectors. 2 An approach, closely related to the one in this paper, is the spectral expansion method in [13].

Reference-contexts: The difficult step in this approach is the computation of the eigenvalues. In special cases, particular properties may be exploited to simplify the eigenvalue problem, see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>. In fact, the main contribution of this paper is that for a general class of Markov processes it is shown that the relevant eigenvalues can indeed be determined very efficiently. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. <p> In this case, i represents the number of servers that are operative. We have a 0 = fi; c 1 = ; b 1 = c 1 = =s; d 0 = ff and all other coefficients are equal to zero. Example 2.5 The P IP P=M=1 queue (see <ref> [10] </ref>). The arrival process is a superposition of s independent, identical, interrupted Poisson processes with exponentially distributed on-times with parameter ff, exponentially distributed off-times with parameter fi and arrival rate during on-times equal to . Service times of customers are exponentially distributed with parameter .

Reference-contexts: Result (1) may be linked to the (modified) matrix-geometric representation of the equilibrium distribution (see <ref> [15] </ref>). It is readily seen that it has the form p j = p 0 R j ; j = 0; 1; : : : ; (2) where p j is the row vector of equilibrium probabilities (p (0; j); p (1; j); : : : ; p (s; j)). <p> The relaxation of condition (ii) will be discussed in the final section. Next, we will determine the ergodicity condition of the process. Because the process is a Markov process of the GI=M=1 type, we can use Neuts' mean drift condition, i.e. formula (1.7.11) in <ref> [15] </ref>, to obtain the ergodicity condition.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 8 we give some conclusions and final remarks. 2 Examples The following queueing models known from the literature, fit into the class of Markov processes that we study in this paper. Example 2.1 The M=E 2 =s queue (see <ref> [16] </ref>). Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with rate and have service times consisting of two exponential phases with parameter . The set V consists of all unsaturated states, i.e. states in which not all servers are busy. <p> However, it is difficult to prove directly that there are s + 1 zeros inside the unit circle and to numerically determine these zeros. Therefore we employ an idea of <ref> [16, 6, 1] </ref> to transform the difference equations (7) into a single differential equation for the generating function of the sequence y (i).
