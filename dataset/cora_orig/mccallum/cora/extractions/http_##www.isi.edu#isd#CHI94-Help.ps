Abstract: Model-based interface design can save substantial effort in building help systems for interactive applications by generating help automatically from the model used to implement the interface, and by providing a framework for developers to easily refine the automatically-generated help texts. This paper describes a system that generates hypertext-based help about data presented in application displays, commands to manipulate data, and interaction techniques to invoke commands. The refinement component provides several levels of customization, including programming-by-example techniques to let developers edit directly help windows that the system produces, and the possibility to refine help generation rules.

Reference-contexts: Also, unlike other help generation systems, both Cartoonist and H3 generate help that depends on the context of an application and its interface. Techniques based on AI technology have been proposed to produce help and documentation systems, <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. The AI systems have more sophisticated natural language generation facilities, and also include planners to construct help texts with better discourse structures than those in H3.

Reference-contexts: Architecture help system is a help request , which is a region in the application display. The outputs are the Help Window, and the highlightings of regions in the Application Window. The top-left portion of the figure shows the main elements of the HUMANOID interface generation system <ref> [3, 9, 10] </ref>. The model describes the commands and objects of an application ( Application), the methods for presenting these commands and objects (Presentation ), and the behavior of these objects in response to input events ( Behavior).

Reference-contexts: H3 does not currently provide task-oriented help to answer questions like "How do I delete a file?". The help information that H3 gives users goes beyond canned texts attached to the static portions of the display, like typical Macintosh balloon help <ref> [4] </ref>. H3 help messages consist of concatenations of pieces of canned texts with embedded links that show where information mentioned in the help text is displayed, and can also be used to access related information (like in hypertext systems). <p> In the following sections we describe the implementation of H3 and then the facilities for customizing the help systems. We close with conclusions and directions for future work. RELATED WORK H3 is similar in spirit to balloon help on Macintoshes <ref> [4] </ref>. Both systems are geared towards providing help about features of an application that are visible on the application displays, and neither system supports task-oriented help to assist users with high level tasks (e.g., how do I insert a figure in my document). The are also many differences.

Reference-contexts: This added complexity in H3 is necessary because it provides much more information to users, more than fits in a small pop up window. H3 is also similar to the help in Microsoft Windows <ref> [5] </ref>, or OS/2 [7] in that it uses a separate help window to show help, and in the use of hypertext links to navigate to related topics.

Reference-contexts: H3 currently does not provide good support for navigating the help system. H3 does not have a history mechanism or features that let users navigate the help information in an organized way. Cartoonist <ref> [8] </ref> is another example of a system that generates help automatically from the models used to construct an interface. Cartoonist automatically constructs animations that show how to invoke the commands of an application. H3 provides hypertext messages rather than animations, and covers a complementary domain. <p> For similar reasons, H3 does not support task-oriented help either. Producing such help is beyond the scope of rule systems like ours. It requires a planner that can compute the sequence of commands needed to perform a given task <ref> [8] </ref>. Architecture help system is a help request , which is a region in the application display. The outputs are the Help Window, and the highlightings of regions in the Application Window. <p> We are interested in incorporating ideas from Cartoonist to be able to show animations, and to produce task-oriented help.
