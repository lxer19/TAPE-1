Title: On Transport Protocols for Audio Conferencing in CSCW Environments

Abstract: This position paper describes ongoing work in the design and implementation of transport protocols for audio conferencing in shared window computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) environments. Such applications require that the audio stream be synchronized with actions in shared windows. We make no assumptions about the underlying communications network and only require that it provide best-effort service. We propose the use of rate control based transport protocols and discuss various parameters in the design of the protocol, as well as means to make the protocol adapt to varying network conditions.

Reference-contexts: This is achieved by reserving resources along the path of the information transfer in the network. Various schemes have been proposed to do this (see [5] and the references therein and <ref> [1] </ref>). In predicted service the client again provides a characterization of its traffic to the network. However, in this case the network only ensures that if the traffic from other clients is similar to the load it has seen in the past, then it will provide the desired performance.

Reference-contexts: Transport protocols based on rate control include NETBLT [4], VMTP <ref> [2] </ref>, and XTP [3]. These protocols are concerned with maintaining a high end-to-end throughput. In the case of audio conferencing the throughput requirements are quite modest (around 100Kbps). However, audio has the real-time requirement of making the data available to the receiver before its playback time (formally defined below).

Reference-contexts: This is the delay experienced by a packet from the time it is created at the sender's audio device to the time it is played at the receiver. The packet delay has two components, a fixed and a variable component <ref> [13, 7] </ref>. The fixed component of the total delay, denoted t f , is identical for all packets and includes the propagation delay and other fixed overheads. The variable component of the delay, denoted t v , is the queueing delay experienced by the packet at various nodes.
