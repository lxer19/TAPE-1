Title: A Nonabstract Approach to Lattice Rule Canonical Forms  
Author: J. N. Lyness and S. Joe 
Abstract: The rank and invariants of a general lattice rule conventionally are defined in terms of the group-theoretic properties of the rule. Here we give a nonabstract definition of the rank and invariants by exploiting what we term the Sylow p-decomposition of a lattice rule. This decomposition allows a canonical D Z form to be calculated for any lattice rule. A new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for recognizing a canonical form is given.

Reference-contexts: A canonical form of this rule is given in section 5. (The reader may verify that the D Z form is canonical if the first row of Z is replaced by [ 7 5 8 ].) The next result is related to Theorem 3.2 of <ref> [L93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the theory of lattice rules forms an excellent application of Kronecker's celebrated group representation theorem; see, for example, [S86, p. 45 et seq.]. However, the practical problem remains of actually calculating a canonical form of a general rule given in D Z form. In a previous paper <ref> [LJ96] </ref> we treated prime-power rules, that is, rules whose order, (Q), is a power of some prime. For these rules the invariants have a nonabstract definition that is closely related to the ideas underlying projection regularity (see [LJ96]). <p> In a previous paper <ref> [LJ96] </ref> we treated prime-power rules, that is, rules whose order, (Q), is a power of some prime. For these rules the invariants have a nonabstract definition that is closely related to the ideas underlying projection regularity (see [LJ96]). In that less complicated context, a theory was developed that does not rely on group theory or lattice theory at all. We state here a few key definitions and results from that paper. Definition 1.3 Let a prime-power rule Q have invariants n i and rank r. <p> When D is sequential, this gives d i+1 j d i , and so the invariants also have this property. In this paper we exploit the previous work of <ref> [LJ96] </ref> on prime-power rules to provide a corresponding theory for general rules. This is done by means of a nonabstract manifestation of the Kronecker theorem mentioned above. <p> Other transformations that allow one to change D and Z by consistent row interchange, removal of common factors, and removal of redundant rows are listed in <ref> [LJ96] </ref>. In this paper we do not use them explicitly. However, two more transformations are given in Theorem 2.9 below. We now introduce the sum of lattice rules. This is a simple concept. <p> for S (j) is repetitive, there is one value of j for which the relation in (2.24) is a strict inequality; this makes the relation in (2.25) a strict inequality, showing that the form for Q is also repetitive. 2 7 3 Canonical Form of a General Lattice Rule In <ref> [LJ96] </ref>, the rank and invariants for prime-power rules are defined in a nonabstract manner. Some of their properties are recalled in the introduction. In this section we exploit these definitions to define the same quantities in the context of a general lattice rule. <p> Otherwise, it is necessary to form a new representation for S (j) that is sequential and nonrepetitive. This can be accomplished by using the transformations of Theorem 2.1 and the others mentioned just after that theorem. In <ref> [LJ96] </ref> a procedure for doing this is given as part of the proof of Theorem 3.7. When all the Sylow p j -components are in sequential nonrepetitive form, we assemble them, row by row. <p> 1 ; i 2 ; : : : ; i min (s;t) g, where i j 2 f1; 2; : : : ; sg, and ( 1; when k = m, 0; when k &gt; m, m = 1; 2; : : : ; min (s; t): It follows from <ref> [LJ96, Theorem 3.4] </ref> that a candidate form in which Z is cpuut is nonrepetitive. Corollary 4.4 A candidate form in which Z is cpuut is a canonical form. When t = s above, the matrix Z is an example of a unimodular matrix.

Reference-contexts: This form is known as a t-cycle D Z form of an s-dimensional lattice rule <ref> [LK95] </ref>. The parameters in the abbreviation Q [t; D; Z; s] are D, which denotes the t fi t diagonal integer matrix 10:47 a.m., August 6, 1997 1 having positive diagonal elements d i , and Z, which denotes the t fi s integer matrix having rows z i . <p> When t = s above, the matrix Z is an example of a unimodular matrix. This is one in which j det Zj = 1. Any D Z form in which Z is unimodular is nonrepetitive (see <ref> [LK95, Theorem 2.2] </ref>). Thus, in particular, we have the following. Corollary 4.5 A candidate form in which Z is unimodular is a canonical form. We now seek a criterion by which one may recognize whether a candidate form is in fact a canonical form.

Reference-contexts: Such a form is termed a canonical form. The definitions given there rely heavily on group theory.
