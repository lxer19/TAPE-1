Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that an alternative using look up tables for this procedure was proposed in [10]. The proposed transmitter/receiver synchronization using a receiver of the form (6) can be demonstrated numerically on several examples from the literature, see e.g. <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. In this paper, we will, amongst others, consider the example from [3]. The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section we present a design procedure for observer dynamics (6) where N = n 1. <p> The proposed transmitter/receiver synchronization using a receiver of the form (6) can be demonstrated numerically on several examples from the literature, see e.g. [3, 9]. In this paper, we will, amongst others, consider the example from <ref> [3] </ref>. The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section we present a design procedure for observer dynamics (6) where N = n 1. Section 3 presents numerical simulations of some synchronization problems where an observer presented in Section 2 is used. <p> ; q 1 ; q 2 is in general more robust to (measurement) noise than observer type 2 (cf. [7],[8]). 3 Examples As an example, consider the transmitter system x 1 (k+1) = (1*)x 1 (k)(1x 1 (k)) + * x 2 (k) (17) presented by Badola et al. in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The resulting observer equations are omitted for reasons of space. For the subsequent simulations, the initial conditions x 1 (0) = 0:2, x 2 (0) = 0:4, ^x 1 (0) = ^x 2 (0) = 0:7 and parameters = 3:7, * = 0:09 were used. Following <ref> [3] </ref>, x 2 (k) and x 3 (k) do not synchronize for these parameters and x 3 (0) = ^x 2 (0) = 0:7 while the observers obtained here show satisfactory behavior. <p> In this case, observing the unknown signals x 2 (k) and fl In <ref> [3] </ref>, x 2 (k) is considered as the drive signal. <p> Moreover, the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics and consequently the convergence rate are selectable. For synchronization as presented in <ref> [3] </ref>, one is neither able to guarantee synchronization nor able to influence the number of steps until synchronizations occurs. 4 Concluding remarks We have presented a control perspective on synchronization of discrete time transmitter systems. <p> Contrary to <ref> [3] </ref>, our results are valid no matter how the initial conditions are chosen. The observer viewpoint on the synchronization problem has also been advocated for continuous time systems, see [12], but the scheme as we used here in discrete time has no direct analogue in continuous time.

Reference-contexts: We now sketch a procedure to derive two different types of observers for a strongly locally observable system (8). This procedure was proposed in [7, 8] and represents an extension of the works <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. For clarity of presentation, we will restrict to the case that n = 3. Extensions to other cases are straightforward.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that under fairly weak conditions receiver dynamics (6) exist such that the transmitter (1,2) and (6) synchronize, see Section 2. Actually, the necessary conditions involved are closely related with global observability, cf. <ref> [11] </ref>, or, the Takens-Aeyels-Sauer Reconstruction Theorem, see [16],[1],[2],[15],[13].

Reference-contexts: For that reason several attempts for achieving synchronization of signals like x 2 () and ~x 2 () have been proposed. In particular we like to recall the (reduced) observer viewpoint advocated in <ref> [12] </ref> which basically admits the construction of dynamics ~x 2 (k+1) = ~ f 2 (x 1 (k); ~x 2 (k)): (5) such that (4) holds, whatever initial conditions (1), (2) and (5) have. <p> We will do this using a suitably selected dynamics of the form (6) which basically means that we treat the synchronization problem as a sort of observer problem, cf. <ref> [12] </ref>. Without loss of generality we can assume that f (0) = 0 and h (0) = 0. <p> Contrary to [3], our results are valid no matter how the initial conditions are chosen. The observer viewpoint on the synchronization problem has also been advocated for continuous time systems, see <ref> [12] </ref>, but the scheme as we used here in discrete time has no direct analogue in continuous time. An obvious way to proceed in continuous time therefore could exist in (fast) sampling of the continuous time transmitter and then design a discrete time observer as receiver.

Reference-contexts: receiver now corresponds to the asymptotic matching of (2) and (3), that is lim kx 2 (k) ~x 2 (k)k = 0: (4) Clearly (4) will not be satisfied in general and, in fact, conditions on f 1 and f 2 that guarantee this condition are only partially known, cf. <ref> [13] </ref>. For that reason several attempts for achieving synchronization of signals like x 2 () and ~x 2 () have been proposed.
