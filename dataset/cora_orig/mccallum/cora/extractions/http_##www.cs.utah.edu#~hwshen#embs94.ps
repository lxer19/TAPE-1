Abstract: We present a new method, called differential volume rendering, to speed up the process of volume animation for flow visualization. Data coherency between consecutive simulation time steps is used to avoid casting unnecessary rays from the image plane. We illustrate the utility and speed of the differential volume rendering algorithm with simulation data from electrical wave propagation within a cellular automaton model of the ventricu-lar myocardium. We can achieve considerable disk-space savings and nearly real-time rendering of 3-d flow using low-cost, single processor workstations.

Reference-contexts: Anisotropy of impulse propagation from one element to another is introduced by a dependence of the propagation velocity on the local fiber orientation, with the fastest conduction oriented along the fiber axis. Details of the model may be found in <ref> [1] </ref> . The model is primarily used to study factors that affect the vulnerability of the heart to fibrillation. Hence, most observations need to be concentrated on the propagating activation wavefront.

Reference-contexts: The pixel positions remain undetermined until the user specifies the viewing parameters. Results and Discussion The software for the differential volume rendering algorithm has been implemented using OpenGL, which is portable across most hardware platforms. The parallel projection and template-based 26 connected discrete ray casting paradigms <ref> [2] </ref> were used in our implementation. The performance measurements were evaluated on a SGI Indy workstation with a single 100 MHZ MIPS R4000 processor. Upon analysis of our simulation data, we noticed that only a small fraction of elements changed states between time steps.
