Abstract: e We present a method for recursively rendering a realistic image of a volumetric dataset consisting of a mixtur f sampled and synthetic objects. We describe several volume visualization tools that are based on the use of recur-l sive ray tracing. These include shadows, mirrors, specularity, and constructive solid geometry. We discuss severa ays to enhance our method both in terms of image quality and rendering speed by introducing the principles of
