Title: The Existence of Uniquely G Colourable Graphs  
Author: D. Achlioptas J.I. Brown D.G. Corneil M.S.O. Molloy 
Date: November 5, 1996  
Abstract: Given graphs F and G and a nonnegative integer k, a function : V (F ) ! f1; : : :; kg is a G k-colouring of F if no induced copy of G is monochromatic; F is G k-chromatic if F has a G k-colouring but no G (k 1)-colouring. Further, we say F is uniquely G k-colourable if F is G k-chromatic and, up to a permutation of colours, it has only one G k-colouring. Such notions are extensions of the well known corresponding definitions from chromatic theory. It was conjectured that for all graphs G of order at least two and all positive integers k there exist uniquely G k-colourable graphs. We prove the conjecture and show that in fact in all cases infinitely many such graphs exist.

Reference-contexts: QUESTION: Is F G k-colourable? This problem was introduced in [11], where it was shown to be NP-complete (and its infinite analogue undecidable) for various classes of graphs. Using the results of the current paper, the complexity was fully resolved in <ref> [1] </ref> by showing that the problem is NP-complete for all G of order greater than 2 and all k greater than 1. One can view non G k-colourability from a Ramsey-like viewpoint (with respect to vertex partitions).

Reference-contexts: What has been known so far is that the conjecture holds whenever G or its complement has a universal vertex [12] or is 2-connected <ref> [10, 15, 3] </ref>. In this paper we completely settle the conjecture, and in fact show (in sharp contrast to the unique Ramsey edge colouring case): Theorem 1 For any graph G of order at least 2 and any positive integer k, there exist infinitely many uniquely G k-colourable graphs.

Reference-contexts: The first part will classify all graphs of order at least 2 into three classes. The following sections will deal with the various classes. 2 Background We begin with some background results and notation. In general our hypergraph and graph notation will be standard (c.f. <ref> [4] </ref>). 3 The complement of a graph G is denoted by G. A graph G is k-connected if it cannot be disconnected by the removal of fewer than k vertices.

Reference-contexts: However, P 4 has often been an `odd' graph, in that it is the smallest nontrivial self-complementary graph. The approach we take for P 4 is a probabilistic one. We refer the reader to <ref> [5] </ref> for a general reference on the probabilistic method. Throughout this section, k 2 is a fixed positive integer, n is an arbitrary large integer, and C and C 0 denote constants (depending on k, but not on n).

Reference-contexts: An important result on uniquely k-colourable hypergraphs that we shall need later is: Theorem 2 For all positive integers g, k and r with r 2, there exist infinitely many uniquely k-colourable r-uniform hypergraphs of girth at least g. (This theorem was proved for r = 2 in <ref> [6] </ref> and for all r 3 in [10, 15].) In fact, Theorem 2 was proved primarily to show the existence of uniquely G k-colourable graphs when G or G is 2-connected. We shall return to this in greater detail in a later section.

Reference-contexts: An example of a graph that is uniquely K 1;3 2-colourable is K 3;5 . Various results on unique colourability with respect to other properties can be found in <ref> [7, 10, 13] </ref>. Uniquely k-colourable graphs have attracted considerable attention. Examples of such graphs are self-evident. Any connected bipartite graph is uniquely 2-colourable, and complete k-partite graphs are uniquely k-colourable. Thus the existence of such graphs for standard colourings is a non-issue.

Consider the case where G is a 2-connected graph of order n 2. Given an n-uniform hypergraph H of girth greater than n and a 2-connected graph G of order n, we construct a graph F by placing a copy of G down on every edge of H. <p> First, let's consider the case where G has a universal vertex v. As mentioned in section 2 (and proved in <ref> [12] </ref>), if F k is a graph that is not (G v) k-colourable and whose clique number is equal to that of G v, then substituting a copy of F k for every vertex of a uniquely k-colourable graph yields a uniquely G k-colourable graph.

Grossman <ref> [21] </ref> has considered unique Ramsey edge colourings, the problem of whether there exists for graph G a graph F such that F has exactly one 2-colouring (up to a permutation of colours) of its edges such that no partial subgraph isomorphic to G is monochromatic.

Reference-contexts: Most of the graph theoretic generalizations have revolved around colouring vertices so that the subgraph induced by each colour class has a given property P ; properties of particular interest have included acyclicity, planarity and perfection <ref> [23, 2, 13, 8, 9, 25, 29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We show that this is not the case for G k-colourability. In [12], it was conjectured that G k-colourable graphs exist for all graphs G of order at least 2 and all positive integers k (see also <ref> [30] </ref>). What has been known so far is that the conjecture holds whenever G or its complement has a universal vertex [12] or is 2-connected [10, 15, 3].
