Abstract: Resource security is maybe one of the most important features for any distributed computating on the Web. In this article a new adaptive approach shall be presented realizing the authorization and identification of a remote user using fingerprints built from a set of typical system data related to the respective user. The suggested approach avoids the use of secured, trusted third machines and adapts access rights using a fine-grained set of confidence levels for a possibly changing group of users.

Reference-contexts: 1 Remarks on the Web Security Situation With the increase of the use of distributed computing in networks of workstations or even in the Internet security features become more and more important. Therefore systems like SDSI [4], Kerboros [3] or extended systems like CRISIS <ref> [1] </ref> were developed to certify the security while working on a distributed wide area computer architecture. All these systems need some kind of a centralized, secure and therefore trusted third machine.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, it is required to have anywhere a (maybe distributed) catalog of all approved users what seems to be difficult in a global dimension with the respective steady changes. A great step forward seems to be the JANUS-system <ref> [2] </ref> 'sandboxing' locally running applications that are not fully trusted without having complex login informations.

Reference-contexts: an application uses dangerous system calls (what also may cause an interruption of non-dangerous programs). 2 Basics From our point of view, it does not seem to be realistic to use a kind of login procedure in a web-wide system (e.g. the WOS) because fixed user catalogues cannot be established <ref> [5] </ref> In addition, it make no sense to know who is the user rattening my machine, if he is in a country where I cannot get hold of him. Finally, we argue that each authorization using a login procedure with a password or code can easily be affected. <p> Even if the data are very complex they had to be fixed for some times. Therefore, the main problem does not consist only in the authentication of a user but in the question 'Whom I can trust?'. From the working mechanisms of the WOS-warehouses described in <ref> [5] </ref> it can be expected that a limited, but maybe slowly changing group of people will frequently use a considered machine because they find there most services with the required quality for their work.
