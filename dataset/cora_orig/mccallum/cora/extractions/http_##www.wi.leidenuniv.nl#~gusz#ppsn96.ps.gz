Abstract: Using the multi-parent diagonal and scanning crossover in GAs reproduction operators obtain an adjustable arity. Hereby sexuality becomes a graded feature instead of a Boolean one. Our main objective is to relate the performance of GAs to the extent of sexuality used for reproduction on less arbitrary functions then those reported in the current literature. We investigate GA behaviour on Kauffman's NK-landscapes that allow for systematic characterization and user control of ruggedness of the fitness landscape. We test GAs with a varying extent of sexuality, ranging from asexual to 'very sexual'. Our tests were performed on two types of NK-landscapes: landscapes with random and landscapes with nearest neighbour epistasis. For both landscape types we selected landscapes from a range of ruggednesses. The results confirm the superiority of (very) sexual recombination on mildly epistatic problems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, sexuality looses its Boolean character and becomes a graded feature. So, the old question whether 'sexual reproduction is good or not' can be refined to 'how much sex is good'. The first multi-parent mechanism was global recombination in ES, <ref> [1, 14] </ref> that produces one new individual that may inherit genes from more than two parents. Nevertheless, the number of parents is not determined, thus global recombination does not make sexuality a graded feature.

Scanning crossover generalizes uniform crossover, although creating only one child, by chosing one of the i-th genes of the n parents to be the i-th gene of the child.

Reference-contexts: If the interacting bits are the ones closest to x i (assuming x 1 and x N are neighbors) then we have nearest neighbor interaction (NNI). NK-landscapes were used to investigate the relationship between characteristics of the fitness landscape and the performance of genetic operators, [11]. In <ref> [9] </ref> the usefulness of recombination is assessed comparing different (2 parent) crossovers and hill climbing on NK-landscapes with various ruggedness. Here we conduct an 'introspective' study, concentrating on crossover itself. <p> We use two test suites, one with NNI and one with RNI. In both test suites we have landscapes for K = 0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 25. For higher values, like K = 50; 99 it was shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that GAs cannot treat them well, therfore they are not tested here. Let the number of parents be denoted by P , the type of crossover operator by C and the type of epistatic interaction by I. <p> It is clear from the results that the GA performance becomes worse on more rugged landscapes. In this sense the multi-parent operators show similar behavior to the standard crossovers, <ref> [9] </ref>.

Our results can also be related to those of Hordijk and Manderick <ref> [9] </ref>, who concluded that sexual recombination is useful for low and medium epistasis (not very rugged landscapes). We found that on these very problems a generalization of 1-point 2-parent crossover (that they use) to n-parent diagonal crossover increases GA performance.

Thereafter in Section 4 we describe the experimental setup, and in Section 5 we summarize the test results. <p> Finally, we draw conclusions and sketch further research in Section 6. 2 NK-landscapes The family of NK-landscapes was introduced by Kauffman as a class of problems where the fitness landscape can be gradually tuned from smooth to chaotic, <ref> [10] </ref>. The parameters N , respectively K specify the total number of bits (which will equal the chromosome length in the GA searching this landscape) and the number of bits that influence a particular bit.

Since uniform scanning is very similar to discrete global recombination in ES, this observation seems to confirm the experiences of Schwefel, <ref> [14] </ref> p. 146. It is clear from the results that the GA performance becomes worse on more rugged landscapes. In this sense the multi-parent operators show similar behavior to the standard crossovers, [9].
