Abstract: 1 In the course of networking research, it is common for a prototype system to reach a state where it is sufficiently stable that only a large scale installation under real work-loads will reveal more errors in the system or information about its scaling properties. However, users accustomed to a stable production system are reluctant to switch to a potentially error-prone prototype system. This paper describes a network utilizing dynamic routing that allows transparent use of a prototype network, and resorts to a stable production network in the event of errors. The sys

Reference-contexts: The switches provide a small amount of buffering (several bytes) and otherwise rely on source-routed cut-through switching in hardware. The ATOMIC LAN was developed at ISI in conjunction with CalTech, and the technology has been spun off to an independent commercial venture called Myricom <ref> [1] </ref>. Myri-com markets their implementation of the ATOMIC LAN under the name Myrinet; we use ATOMIC LAN to refer to the technology in general, and Myrinet to refer to Myri-coms particular design. The ATOMIC LAN has properties that distinguish it from conventional LAN systems.

Reference-contexts: The problem therein lies with the notion of an IP address. FIGURE 3. Dual-homing of a host Traditionally, hosts have a single IP address, that of their sole network connection <ref> [2] </ref>. Hosts with multiple connections may use a single IP address or multiple IP addresses (Figure 4). A single host IP address is bound dynamically (via the Address Resolution Protocol, ARP [11]) to one of multiple interfaces; this is known as link-layer multiplexing [2]. <p> address, that of their sole network connection <ref> [2] </ref>. Hosts with multiple connections may use a single IP address or multiple IP addresses (Figure 4). A single host IP address is bound dynamically (via the Address Resolution Protocol, ARP [11]) to one of multiple interfaces; this is known as link-layer multiplexing [2]. A host alternately may use multiple IP addresses, bound to each interface; this is known as multi-homing. Although link-layer multiplexing is a somewhat less clean solution than multi-homing, it is nonetheless both common practice and documented in Internet standards [2]. <p> one of multiple interfaces; this is known as link-layer multiplexing <ref> [2] </ref>. A host alternately may use multiple IP addresses, bound to each interface; this is known as multi-homing. Although link-layer multiplexing is a somewhat less clean solution than multi-homing, it is nonetheless both common practice and documented in Internet standards [2]. The difference between the two is whether the host is known by a single IP address or multiple IP addresses, and whether the dynamic switchover occurs at a link or network layer. Link layer dynamic methods are based on variant uses of the ARP protocol, discussed in Section 5.

Reference-contexts: The routing table can thus become inconsistent, resulting in unrecoverable host failures. Link protocol solutions were also considered. ISI has traditionally favored network-based, IP-level solutions. However, a prevalent alternative is to use proxy ARP, where one interface response on behalf of another to an ARP request <ref> [3] </ref>. Proxy ARP can be used to emulate dynamic routing [4]. However, ARP entries are refreshed locally whenever referenced, which results in misrouting when a link address changes before the ARP entry becomes stale (IP destination is mapped to a different link address).

Reference-contexts: The -a names are the interfaces on the ATOMIC LAN. Each host serves as its own router, as in default routes use the slow ethernet. Every host and gateway on the ATOMIC LAN runs gated to implement RIP and manage its local routing table <ref> [5] </ref>. The particular configurations are listed in Appendix A. FIGURE 9.

Reference-contexts: Virtual interfaces are used to attach the hosts IP address to a non-existent internal interface, and the host acts as a router among the different addresses; these interfaces are supported via multiple IP addresses per interface in recent OSs (Solaris, FreeBSD) or by OS modifications (SunOS) <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Proxy ARP can be used to emulate dynamic routing [4]. However, ARP entries are refreshed locally whenever referenced, which results in misrouting when a link address changes before the ARP entry becomes stale (IP destination is mapped to a different link address). Recently proposed UN-ARP <ref> [8] </ref> provides a way to flush such stale entries, at the expense of lost connectivity until the ARP entry is restored. UN-ARP is experimental, and would require OS upgrades to deploy at ISI. Recall that OS upgrades were not desired.

Reference-contexts: The ATOMIC-2 research group at ISI is exploring the issues associated with introducing the ATOMIC LAN, a 640 Mbps LAN invented at ISI, into a distributed computing environment <ref> [12] </ref>. The research focuses on optimizing existing software to use the increased bandwidth offered by this new technology. <p> It is also beneficial if users have control over their own connectivity. These constraints are listed in Figure 2. 2.1: The ATOMIC LAN The ATOMIC LAN is a 640 Mbps network composed of point-to-point full-duplex links, interconnected by simple switch boxes <ref> [12] </ref>. The links use byte-wide parallel transmission over twisted-pair copper wires, with additional signalling wires. The switches provide a small amount of buffering (several bytes) and otherwise rely on source-routed cut-through switching in hardware.
