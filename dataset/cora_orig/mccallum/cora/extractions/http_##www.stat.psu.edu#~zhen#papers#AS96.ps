Abstract: A computational scheme for fitting smoothing spline ANOVA models to large data sets with a (near) tensor product design is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analyses. The proposed scheme uses the backfitting algorithm to take advantage of the tensor product design to save both computational memory and time. Several ways to further speed up the backfitting algorithm, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, are discussed. An iterative imputation procedure is used to handle the cases of near tensor product designs. An application to a global historical surface air temperature data set, which motivated this work, is used to illustrate the scheme proposed.

Reference-contexts: Since the objective function in (10) is quadratic and nonnegative (Q is nonnegative definite), it must have a minimizer. It is easy to show that even though the minimizer c and d 8 may not be unique, the corresponding f is unique if S is of full rank <ref> (see, for example, Chen, Gu and Wahba 1989, p.517) </ref>. That is, the SS-ANOVA estimate f is uniquely defined. Because the decomposition (2) is unique, all the component functions of f are also uniquely defined.

Both the anomaly and SS-ANOVA approaches have corrected the bias in the last two years of the first series.

Reference-contexts: The motivation for this work came from the spatial-temporal analysis of a global historical surface air temperature data set. The data set has tens of thousands of observations, which makes the currently available methods to fit SS-ANOVA models, such as the one implemented in Rkpack <ref> (Gu, 1989) </ref>, unusable. This data set will be used to illustrate our proposed computational scheme. The paper is organized as follows. The SS-ANOVA approach to multivariate function estimation is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes our general computational strategy using the backfitting algorithm. <p> Since the objective function in (10) is quadratic and nonnegative (Q is nonnegative definite), it must have a minimizer. It is easy to show that even though the minimizer c and d 8 may not be unique, the corresponding f is unique if S is of full rank <ref> (see, for example, Chen, Gu and Wahba 1989, p.517) </ref>. That is, the SS-ANOVA estimate f is uniquely defined. Because the decomposition (2) is unique, all the component functions of f are also uniquely defined. <p> are needed. 7 Timing It is clear that the memory requirement of the backfitting algorithms described in the previous sections is of an order O (max (n t ; n P ) 2 ), while the memory requirement of direct matrix decomposition methods such as the one implemented in Rkpack <ref> (Gu, 1989) </ref> is of an order O (n 2 ).

Reference-contexts: It generalizes the decomposition of multiple factor effects in an ordinary ANOVA and the smoothing spline method for univariate function estimation. It has been applied to various data sets, for example, an environmental data set <ref> (Gu and Wahba, 1993a,b) </ref>, and an epidemiological data set (Wahba, Wang, Gu, Klein and Klein, 1996). In this article, an application to the spatial-temporal analysis of a global historical temperature data set will be discussed. A major difficulty in using SS-ANOVA is its large computational demand.

Reference-contexts: But it is clearly due to the estimation method used because the records for the Antarctic region in our data end in 1988. The data set we have used in this article is a subset of so-called Jones-Wigley data set <ref> (see Jones, et al., 1991) </ref>. We obtained this data set from http://cdiac.ESD.ORNL.GOV/ftp/. It is a combination of four files: ndp020r1/jonesnh.dat, ndp020r1/jonessh.dat, ndp032/ndp032.tm1 and ndp032/ndp032.tm2.

Reference-contexts: This may be used in (27) to give an over-estimated ! b . Note that a slightly over-estimated ! b is better than a slightly under-estimated ! b . It can also be shown <ref> (Young 1971, p. 144 and 147) </ref> that 2 is the spectral radius of the Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix which can be estimated by the power method after some Gauss-Seidel iteration steps are taken. See Young (1971, p. 206) for an explanation.
