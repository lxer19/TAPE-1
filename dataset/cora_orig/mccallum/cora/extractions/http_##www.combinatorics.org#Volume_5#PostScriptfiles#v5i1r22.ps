Reference-contexts: Nebe [10] shows that the Mordell-Weil lattice M W 44 has t = 2,708,112. Nebe [11] shows that a 64-dimensional lattice constructed in [10] is extremal 3-modular, and so by modular form theory has t = 138,458,880. Bachoc and Nebe <ref> [1] </ref> give an 80-dimensional lattice with t = 1,250,172,000. Elkies [6] calculated the kissing number of his lattice M W 128 : it is 218,044,170,240, over 170 times that of BW 128 .

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Let t n denote the maximal kissing number in dimension n, that is, the greatest number of n-dimensional spheres that can touch another sphere of the same size. Although asymptotic bounds on t n are known <ref> [5] </ref>, little is known about explicit constructions, especially for n &gt; 32. Up to now the best explicit constructions have come from lattice packings. <p> In contrast, Quebbemann's lattice Q 32 [14], <ref> [5, Chap. 8] </ref> has t = 261,120. In recent years the kissing numbers of a few other lattices in dimensions &gt; 32 have been determined. Nebe [10] shows that the Mordell-Weil lattice M W 44 has t = 2,708,112. <p> A (44; 44; 44)A (44; 11) + A (44; 8; 8)A (8; 2) + A (44; 2; 2)A (2; 1) 1 2 21 + 6622 2 7 + 2 4 = 2,948,552. n=48. In 48 dimensions the three known unimodular extremal unimodular lattices <ref> [5] </ref>, [10] have kissing number 52,416,000. Our present construction gives less than half this value. n=64. The words of weight 16 in an extended cyclic code C (64; 16) of size 2 28 from [13] show that A (64; 16; 16) 30,828.

Reference-contexts: There is some freedom in choosing the n -, which helps to compensate for our ignorance. the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998), #R22 3 (2) A table of lower bounds on A (n; d) has been given by Litsyn <ref> [7] </ref>, extending the table in [9]. A table of lower bounds on A (n; d; w) for n 28 is given in [2], but for larger n little is known. <p> It can obviously be modified to produce spherical codes with other angles. 3. Examples We illustrate the construction by giving new records in dimensions 32, 36, 40, 44, 64, 80 and 128.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach can be based on Warren D. Smith's discovery (personal communication, May 1997) that the 2754 minimal vectors of the self-dual length 18 distance 8 code over F 4 <ref> [8] </ref> yields t 36 2754 2 7 = 352,512 by changing any even number of signs. By adjoining additional vectors with fractional coordinates R. H. Hardin and N. J. A. Sloane increased this to 386,570, which held the record until it was overtaken by the present construction.
