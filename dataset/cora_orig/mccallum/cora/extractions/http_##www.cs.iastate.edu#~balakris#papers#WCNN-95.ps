Abstract: Genetic algorithms and related evolutionary techniques offer a promising approach for automatically exploring the design space of neural architectures for artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling. Central to this process of evolutionary design of neural architectures (EDNA) is the choice of the representation scheme that is used to encode a neural architecture in the form of a gene string (genotype) and to decode a genotype into the corresponding neural architecture (phenotype). The representation scheme used not only constrains the class of neural architectures that are representable (evolvable) in the system, but also determines the efficiency and the time-space complexity of the evolutionary design procedure as a whole. This paper identifies and discusses a set of properties that can be used to characterize different representations used in EDNA and to design or select representations with the necessary properties for particular classes of applications.

Reference-contexts: We expect these definitions to get more refined as we examine a larger variety of EDNA systems more closely. Since space does not permit a detailed exposition here, the interested reader is referred to <ref> (Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1995a) </ref> for an analysis of properties of several EDNA systems. 2.1 Properties of Genetic Representations We begin by stating some useful definitions. (D1) G the space of genotypes representable in a chosen encoding scheme. <p> Additionally, if the genetic operators are designed to have the property of closure, then one can envision constrained closure wherein all genotypes do not correspond to acceptable phenotypes, however, closure is guaranteed since the system never generates the invalid genotypes (see <ref> (Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1995a) </ref> for details). 3. <p> Other notions of modularity having to do with functional modules, recursively-defined modules etc. are worth exploring <ref> (Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1995a) </ref>. 8. Redundancy: Redundancy can manifest itself at various levels and in different forms in an EDNA system. Redundancy often contributes to the robustness of the system in the face of failure of components or processes.
