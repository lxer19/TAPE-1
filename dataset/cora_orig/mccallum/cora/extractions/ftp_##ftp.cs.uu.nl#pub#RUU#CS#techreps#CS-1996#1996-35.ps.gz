Title: On Piercing Sets of Objects  
Author: Matthew J. Katz Franck Nielsen 
Abstract: A set of objects is k-pierceable if there exists a set of k points such that each object is pierced by (contains) at least one of these points. Finding the smallest integer k such that a set is k-pierceable is NP-complete. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding a piercing set (i.e., a set of k points as above) for several classes of convex objects and small values of k. In some of the cases, our algorithms imply known as well as new Helly-type theorems, thus adding to previous results of Danzer and Grunbaum who studied the case of axis-parallel boxes. The problems studied here are related to the collection of optimization problems in which one seeks the smallest scaling factor of a centrally symmetric convex object K, so that a set of points can be covered by k congruent homothets of K.

Reference-contexts: These paradigms fit the Helly-type theorems that are derived in this paper. We thus can obtain a randomized linear-time algorithm for the corresponding piercing problems (which can be derandomized, in turn, using the algorithm of Chazelle and Matousek <ref> [CM93] </ref>). However, these algorithms are much more complicated than ours. Moreover, our algorithms consist of the proofs for the Helly-type theorems that we obtain. Table 1 summarizes our results. We also show that h (C; Q 2 ) = 1, where C is the class of 4-sided convex polygons.

Reference-contexts: S is k-pierceable if there exists a set P of k points in E d such that each object in S is pierced by (contains) at least one point in P. Perhaps one of the most famous theorems in convex geometry is Helly's theorem <ref> [DGK63, GW93] </ref> that states that S is 1-pierceable (i.e., has a non-empty intersection) if and only if every subset of S of cardinality d + 1 is 1-pierceable.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that if K is a centrally symmetric strictly convex object in the plane (e.g., a disk), then h (T 2 (K); Q 2 ) = 1 (see <ref> [HD60] </ref> for an elegant proof). This immediately implies that the 2-center decision problem is not an LP-type problem, since every LP-type problem implies a Helly-type theorem [Ame94] (see discussion below).

Reference-contexts: Then, P can be covered by k translates of K iff P K is k-pierceable. Generally, once the decision problem is solved efficiently, we link it with the parametric searching technique of Megiddo <ref> [Meg83] </ref>, in order to obtain an efficient solution for the original optimization problem. For example, consider the 2-center problem. In this problem we wish to cover P by two congruent disks of minimum radius.

Nevertheless, she gave two paradigms for obtaining a LP-type problem from a Helly-type theorem.

Reference-contexts: This is equivalent to the following problem. Let P K be the set of unit disks centered at the points of P, determine whether P K is 2-pierceable. Recently, Sharir <ref> [Sha96] </ref> has presented a nearly linear algorithm for the 2-center decision problem, which immediately implies a nearly linear solution to the equivalent piercing problem.
