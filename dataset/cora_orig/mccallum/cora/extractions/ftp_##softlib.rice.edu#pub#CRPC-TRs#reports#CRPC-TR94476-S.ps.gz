Reference-contexts: ANALYSIS OF INEXACT TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS 23 9.1. Boundary control of a nonlinear heat equation. The first example is the boundary control of a nonlinear heat equation. This and similar control problems are discussed e.g. in <ref> [5] </ref>, [30], [33], [40]. The goal is to control the heating process in such a way that the temperature at the boundary x = 1 follows a certain desired temperature profile y d (t). The control u (t) acts on the boundary x = 0. <p> Here u low ; u upp 2 L 1 (0; T ) are given functions. If the partial differential equation and the integral are discretized we obtain an optimization problem of the form (1.1). The discretization uses finite elements and is discussed in <ref> [5] </ref> (see also [24], [30]). The spatial discretization is done using piecewise linear finite elements with N x subintervals of equidistant length in (0; 1). The time discretization is performed by partitioning the interval [0; T ] into N t equidistant subintervals. <p> If spatial and time discretization are chosen properly, the partial Jacobian C y (x) is invertible with uniformly bounded inverse. This follows from the ellipticity of the problems that have to be solved in every time step. See <ref> [5] </ref>, [30]. Due to the simple structure of the objective function, derivatives of f are bounded. Since we use the adjoint multiplier, the previous results imply the boundedness of the Lagrange multiplier estimates.

Reference-contexts: Applications include optimal control problems, parameter identification problems and inverse problems, and design optimization. The algorithms investigated in this paper are extensions of the trust-region interior-point (TRIP) sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithms introduced and analyzed in <ref> [14] </ref>. The TRIP SQP algorithms are SQP methods that use trust regions as a strategy for globalization and for regularization of the subproblems and that apply an affine scaling interior-point approach to deal with the bounds on the variables u. <p> Subproblems in the TRIP SQP algorithms are solved iteratively. As a consequence, only directional derivatives are needed in the implementation of these algorithms. However, differentiability is required to guarantee convergence. In <ref> [14] </ref> it is assumed that derivative information is available exactly and that linearized equations can be solved exactly. In many applications these assumptions are unrealistic. Derivative information may be approximated, for example, by finite differences. <p> Similar results are derived for the inexactness that arises in the computation of directional derivatives of C (x). The details are presented in this paper. The convergence results presented in this paper rely on the theory given in [13], <ref> [14] </ref>. A comprehensive convergence theory is presented in [49].

The algorithms described in this section have been proposed and analyzed in <ref> [14] </ref>. They use exact first-order derivative infor mation and require that the linear systems are solved exactly. The purpose of this section is to provide the framework for this class of algorithms. The TRIP SQP algorithms are iterative algorithms. <p> The role of these matrices in the quadratic (3.5) is related to the application of Newton's method to the system of nonlinear equations arising from the first-order KKT conditions. See <ref> [14] </ref> for more details. Exact TRIP SQP algorithms include two approaches to compute (s k ) u : a coupled approach and a decoupled approach. ANALYSIS OF INEXACT TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS 7 The decoupled approach [14] is associated with the trust-region subproblem minimize k (s u )(3.7) subject to kD 1 <p> See <ref> [14] </ref> for more details. Exact TRIP SQP algorithms include two approaches to compute (s k ) u : a coupled approach and a decoupled approach. ANALYSIS OF INEXACT TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS 7 The decoupled approach [14] is associated with the trust-region subproblem minimize k (s u )(3.7) subject to kD 1 k s u k ffi k :(3.8) In this approach the tangential component (s k ) u has to satisfy a fraction of Cauchy decrease condition associated with the trust-region subproblem (3.7)-(3.8). <p> This condition requires (s k ) u to give as much decrease on the quadratic (3.5) as the decrease given by D 2 k W T k ). It can be proved (see <ref> [14, Lemma 6.2] </ref>) that such a condi tion implies q k (s n k + W k (s k ) u ) k rq k (s n n k rq k (s n o (3.9) where 4 , 5 , and 6 are positive constants independent of k. <p> The use of conjugate gradients to solve trust-region subproblems in unconstrained minimization has been suggested in [46], [48]. An adaptation of these algorithms to compute the tangential component that takes into account the problem structure and the bound constraints is presented in <ref> [14] </ref> and is given by: Algorithm 3.1 (Exact computation of s k = s n k + W k (s k ) u using the de coupled approach). 1 Set s 0 k rq k (s n k r 0 , d 0 = q 0 , and * &gt; 0. <p> This condition requires (s k ) u to give as much decrease on the quadratic (3.5) as the decrease given by D 2 k rq k (s n k ). It is shown in <ref> [14, Lemma 6.2] </ref> that this condition also implies (3.9). Again one can use a conjugate-gradient method to compute the tangential component. <p> The reason is that in this case the decoupled approach may underestimate the size of W k (s k ) u vastly and, as a consequence, may require more unsuccessful iterations. See also <ref> [14, x5.2.2] </ref>. ANALYSIS OF INEXACT TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS 9 Table 1 Number of linear solvers to compute the tangential component. Here I (k) denotes the number of conjugate gradient iterations. <p> Of course the rules to update the trust radius in the previous algorithm can be much more involved but the above suffices to prove convergence results and to understand the trust-region mechanism. From these rules we have the following lemma (see <ref> [14, Lemma 6.1] </ref>). Lemma 4.1. Every step satisfies ks k k 8 ffi k and ffi k+1 8 ks k k ;(4.13) where 8 is a positive constant independent of k.

For all iterations k, we assume that x k ; x k + s k 2 , where is an open subset of IR n . <p> The terms O (ks k k 2 ) and O (ks k k 3 ) come from IA.3. The rest of the proof follows from <ref> [14, Lemma 6.5] </ref>. The following four lemmas bound the predicted decrease. Lemma 5.3. <p> Proof. The proof is the same as the proof of Lemma 7.2 in <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> There exists a positive constant ff such that, if kC k k ffffi k then pred (s k ; k ) 12 ffi k ;(5.7) where 12 is positive and does not depend on k. Proof. See <ref> [14, Lemma 7.3] </ref>. Lemma 5.6. The predicted decrease satisfies pred (s k ; k ) k for all k. Proof. It follows directly from the Scheme 2.4 that updates k . Now we use the theory given in [13], [14] to state the following result. <p> Proof. See [14, Lemma 7.3]. Lemma 5.6. The predicted decrease satisfies pred (s k ; k ) k for all k. Proof.

The condition imposed in IA.4 is related to the computation of the reduced gradient. If the adjoint multipliers are used, then this condition can be interpreted as a restriction on how accurate these multipliers have to be computed.

ANALYSIS OF INEXACT TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS 22 9. Numerical experiments. We implemented the inexact TRIP SQP Algorithms 4.1 and compared them with the exact TRIP SQP Algorithms proposed in [14]. The numerical test computations were done on a Sun Sparcstation 10 in double precision Fortran 77. We tested our algorithms on examples that have the structure described in this paper. The numerical results are satisfactory and revealed interesting properties of the algorithms. Two examples are described in this section. <p> We use the formula (6.4) to compute the quasi-normal component, and conjugate-gradients to calculate the tangential component. The scheme used to update the trust radius and the inexact form of diagonal scaling matrices D k and D k are the same as in <ref> [14] </ref>. We have used k = = 0:99995 for all k; ffi 0 = 1 as initial trust radius; 1 = 1 and = 10 2 in the penalty scheme. <p> With this discretization scheme, C y (x) is a block bidiagonal matrix with nonsymmetric tridiagonal blocks. In the exact implementation we use the LINPACK subroutine DGTSL to solve the tridiagonal systems. These calculations are reported in <ref> [14] </ref>. We introduce inexactness into this problem by solving these tridiagonal systems inexactly. For this purpose we tested several iterative methods like GMRES, QMR, and BiCGSTAB. The results were quite similar and we report here those obtained with GMRES (10). <p> Since we use the adjoint multiplier, the previous results imply the boundedness of the Lagrange multiplier estimates. ANALYSIS OF INEXACT TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS 24 The functions in this example are those used in [30, Example 4.1], <ref> [14] </ref>. The size of the problem tested is n = 2100, m = 2000 corresponding to the values N t = 100, N x = 20.

Reference-contexts: The results for the solution of systems of nonlinear equations have been extended to analyze inexact Newton methods for the solution of unconstrained minimization problems, e.g. [11], [37], [39]. In a recent paper <ref> [52] </ref>, the impact of inexactness in reduced gradient methods for design optimization has been analyzed. In nonlinear programming, inexactness has been studied by [2], [9], [12], [20], [32], [38], [50] among others.
