Reference-contexts: However, reconsidering the problem a few weeks ago, I've realized that current "state of the art" (specifically, the paper of De-Santis et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>) yields that this problem does have zero knowledge-complexity. 2 The Graph Clustering Problem The Graph Clustering Problem (GCP) is parameterized by a sequence of positive integers, m 1 ; :::; m t . Let m = i=1 m i . <p> Note that GCP 2 and GCP 1;1 correspond to the Graph Isomorphism and Graph Non-Isomorphism problems, respectively. Both are known to have perfect zero-knowledge proof systems [2]. 1 3 The Zero-Knowledge Proof The main tools we use are two results due to De-Santis et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Let us denote the above problem by CL L; . Also, let GI denote the set of pairs of isomorphic graphs. We use two of the results of <ref> [1] </ref>: 1. For every monotone formulae , the language CL GI; has a (perfect) zero-knowledge proof system. 2. <p> But for k = 6 both 6 = 2 + 2 + 2 and 6 = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 have the same value for P m i (i.e., 3). On the other hand, our result can be proven using other tools in <ref> [1] </ref>; for example, the analogous proof systems for closures of Graph Non-Isomorphism. 2
