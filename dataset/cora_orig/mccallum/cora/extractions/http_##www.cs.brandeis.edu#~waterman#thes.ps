Reference-contexts: These can be represented as extended alignment tables, with added rows corresponding to the multiple strings. These alignment tables could further be abstracted to probabilistic descriptions of the sequences, using either a first-order or Markov chain description. Chan and Wang ( <ref> [ Chan and Wang, 1991 ] </ref> ) have used syntheses, zero-order probabilistic descriptions of alignment tables in order to generalize the edit distance and capture the notion of distance between two sets of sequences. <p> AND GENERALIZATION These studies used various similarity measures, such as manhattan metric ( [ Hughs, 1994 ] , vector cosine measures ( [ Hughs, 1994 ] , [ Futrelle and Gauch, 1993 ] ), cosine measures over a reduced space ( [ Schutze, 1993 ] ), or entropy measures ( <ref> [ Chan and Wang, 1991 ] </ref> . Various clustering methods were used to form categories based on these measures. Higher order conditioning The information loss of this simple vector model can be reduced through conditioning the probabilities.

Reference-contexts: An automatic process would be also be beneficial, because of the large number of weights to be assigned. Such a method will be presented in ch. ??. Computing edit distance. There is a straightforward method for computing edit distance ( <ref> [ Sellers, 1974, Wagner and Fisher, 1974 ] </ref> ). As a prime example of dynamic programming, one can compute the edit distance for every pair of initial subsequences of the two strings under study, combining results for shorter substrings to give results for longer subsequences.

Reference-contexts: introduction with applications to many domains, see [ Sankoff and Kruskal, 1983 ] .) 94 15 AUGUST: CHAPTER 4. QUANTIFYING SIMILARITY Number of Operations. The edit distance can be defined as the minimum number of token insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one sequence to another <ref> [ Wagner and Fisher, 1974 ] </ref> . <p> An automatic process would be also be beneficial, because of the large number of weights to be assigned. Such a method will be presented in ch. ??. Computing edit distance. There is a straightforward method for computing edit distance ( <ref> [ Sellers, 1974, Wagner and Fisher, 1974 ] </ref> ). As a prime example of dynamic programming, one can compute the edit distance for every pair of initial subsequences of the two strings under study, combining results for shorter substrings to give results for longer subsequences.
