Reference-contexts: Therefore we augment the local curvature with local phase, and the representation uses histograms of local curvature and phase. Local principal curvatures and phase are computed at several scales from responses to multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters. Then histograms of the curvature ratios <ref> [7, 1] </ref> and phase are generated. Thus, the image is represented by a single vector (multi-scale histograms). <p> For example in Figure 2 (middle-row), the background in most of these face images does not contribute to the curvature histogram. The curvature index or shape index is rescaled and shifted to the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as is done in [1]. A histogram is then computed of the valid index values over an entire image. The second feature used is phase. The phase is simply defined as P (p; ) = atan2 (I y (p; ) ; I x (p; )). <p> For example in Figure 2 (middle-row), the background in most of these face images does not contribute to the curvature histogram.

Although the curvature and phase histograms are in principle insensitive to variations in scale, in early experiments we found that computing histograms at multiple scales dramatically improved the results.

Reference-contexts: In addition, practical applications such as finding similar trademarks in a trademark database significantly benefit from global similarity retrieval. The image intensity surface is robustly characterized using features obtained from responses to multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters.

Reference-contexts: This space is constructed by treating the image as a fixed length vector, and then computing the principal components across the entire database. The images therefore have to be size and intensity normalized, segmented and trained. Similarly, using principal component representations described in <ref> [5] </ref> face recognition is performed in [19]. In [17] the traditional eigen representation is augmented by using most discriminant features and is applied to image retrieval.

Reference-contexts: This system is designed to be applied to a wide class of images and there is no restriction per se. In earlier work we showed that local features computed using Gaussian derivative filters can be used for local similarity, i.e. to retrieve parts of images <ref> [12] </ref>. Here we argue that global similarity can be determined by computing local features and comparing distributions of these features. This technique gives good results, and is reasonably tolerant to view variations. Schiele and Crowley [16] used such a technique for recognizing objects using grey-level images. <p> We argue that such representations are not able to really capture the appearance of an image, particularly in the context of trademark retrieval where moment invariants are widely used. In other work <ref> [12] </ref> we compared moment invariants with the technique presented here and found that moment invariants work best for a single binary shape without holes in it, and, in general, fare worse than the method presented here.

In these methods global representation of appearance may involve computing a few numbers over the entire image. Two images are then considered similar if these numbers are close to each other (say using an L2 norm).

Reference-contexts: A measure of the performance of the retrieval engine can be obtained by examining the recall/precision table for several queries. Briefly, recall is the proportion of the relevant material actually retrieved and precision is the proportion of retrieved material that is relevant <ref> [20] </ref>. It is a standard widely used in the information retrieval community and is one that is adopted here. Queries were submitted each to the trademark and assorted image collection for the purpose of computing recall/precision. The judgment of relevance is qualitative.
