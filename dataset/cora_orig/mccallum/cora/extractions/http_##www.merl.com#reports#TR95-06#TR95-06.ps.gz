Abstract: Embedded hypermedia documents (HDs) are becoming more common in aircraft cockpits, power- and industrial-plant control panels, and other user interfaces to complex systems. These hypermedia documents are often large and heavily cross referenced, yet they must support extremely efficient and intuitive user navigation. Designing such documents well is difficult. In this paper, we describe a computer-based approach to structuring HDs. We show how an interface designer can quantify ease of navigation in a way that makes the HD-structuring problem equivalent to a version of the well-known optimization problem of graph partitioning. This reduction to graph partitioning is the basis for an implemented system that uses known graph-partitioning heuristics to structure HDs automatically.

Reference-contexts: Although graph partitioning is NP-complete [2], near-optimal solutions can usually be obtained using heuristic methods. The Kernighan-Lin (KL) algorithm is a standard method for graph bisection, the special case of graph partitioning that arises when the vertex set is to be split into only two partitions <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 The basic KL algorithm can be readily generalized to account for: more than two partitions; weighted vertices; weighted edges; and various constraints on the sizes of the vertex subsets, such as requiring that no subset exceed a certain size.
