Title: Binary Trees for Classification, Regression, and Clustering, with Applications to Lossy Data Compression  
Note: 1993 IT Symposium Plenary Lecture Richard A. Olshen  
Abstract: This note is a survey of my plenary talk at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory in San Antonio in January, 1993. The subject matter then and here is binary tree-structured methods for classification, regression, survival analysis, and clustering, including a survey of unifying themes and applications, and an introduction to mathematical issues that arise in studying their asymptotic properties. I emphasize the CART TM algorithms of Breiman et al. and applications of the clustering algorithms to predictive, pruned, tree-structured vector quantization (predictive PTSVQ). The talk was a partial summary of collaborations with many authors over an eighteen year period. The talk could hardly do justice to the various collaborations or to the contributions by others, and this note suffers all the more for its brevity. However, I hope that the list of references included will enable interested readers to pursue the subject matter I raise, on their own. Binary tree-structured statistical methods have found wide applicability in recent years. Areas of application have included computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis in medicine ([1], [10-11], [14-15]); ship recognition [1]; prediction in marketing [21]; the search for what are called E. Coli "promoter" regions in molecular genetics [23]; particle identification in physics; and, perhaps especially for this audience, variable rate lossy data compression [3] in digital radiography [3-6,18,22]. It may be of interest, for example, that CART has been shown to be more accurate in diagnosing heart attacks quickly in patients who come into hospital emergency rooms with the chief complaint of acute chest pain, than emergency room physicians [10-11]. The underlying model typically involves predictors (features), X, and a response, Y . Applications are facilitated if we know the joint distribution of (X; Y ), or at least the conditional distribution of Y given X = x, F (jX = x). These quantities are not known a priori, but what we need to know of them is inferred from a learning sample L = f(X i ; Y i ) : i = 1; :::; ng, possibly independent and identically distributed or, more generally, stationary and ergodic, or (in retrospective studies) at least with the Y i s conditionally independent given the X i s (see [12],Chapter 12 of [1], [16-17]). In particular, we use L to infer an unknown future Y fl from its corresponding known X fl . In some cases we estimate the entire conditional distribution F (jX fl = x fl ) of Y fl , even when for some (X i ; Y i ) pairs in L, Y i is "censored." If the range of Y fl is finite and the goal is to predict its value, then the problem is one of "classification" (or "discrimination"). If Y fl is real, the problem is "regression." If Y fl is real, and the goal is to estimate P (Y fl yjX fl = x fl ), then the problem is "survival analysis" (see [2,13-15]). Such applications arise in medicine, and also in questions of reliability. SURVANAL (see [2,14]) is a software implementation of CART-like algorithms for survival analysis that are of special interest to me. PTSVQ can be viewed as an approach to successive 2-means clustering; X fl = Y fl is Euclidean, and

Reference-contexts: The trees I will describe thus entail variable rate lossy codes <ref> [9] </ref>. With coding techniques such as PTSVQ, complexity is quantified by "bit rate," the average depth of the tree divided by the dimension of the pixel vectors X. Algorithms involve successively partitioning, that is to say "splitting," the range of X (the "feature space").

Reference-contexts: However, the pixel intensities coded were not those of the original images, but rather of the residuals when pixel blocks are predicted by a simple Wiener-Hopf technique from previously encoded blocks. (Thus we have predictive PTSVQ; see <ref> [18] </ref> for a discussion of new methods for such prediction.) Sixty images of each type were compressed to six different levels. With an experimental design carefully constructed to conform to clinical practice, three radiologists then used the original and compressed images for diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: Splitting is always "greedy," one node at a time. In order to obtain some possible benefits of "lookahead," which these algorithms do not have but which may not be so important anyway <ref> [20] </ref>, we grow an initial tree larger than we intend to use and prune it back [1,9,19] on the basis of a validation sample or internal validation (typically cross-validation) as in CART and SURVANAL; or on the basis of a bit rate constraint ([9,19,3-6,18,22]) as in PTSVQ-clustering.
