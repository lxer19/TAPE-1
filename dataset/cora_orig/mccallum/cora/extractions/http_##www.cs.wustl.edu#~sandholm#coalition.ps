Title: Coalition Formation Processes with Belief Revision among Bounded Rational Self-Interested Agents

Abstract: This paper studies coalition formation among self-interested agents that cannot make side-payments. We show that ff-core stability reduces to analyzing whether some utility profile is maximal for all agents. We also show that the ff-core is a subset of strong Nash equilibria. This fact carries our stability results directly over to three strategic solution concepts. The main focus of the paper is on analyzing the dynamic process of coalition formation by explicitly modeling the costs of communication and deliberation. We describe an algorithm for sequential action choice where each agent greedily maximizes its stepwise payoff given its beliefs. Conditions are derived under which this process leads to convergence of the agents' beliefs and to a stable coalition structure (when the length of the process is exogenously restricted as well as when agents can choose it). Finally, we show that the outcome of any communication-deliberation process that leads to a stable coalition structure is Pareto-optimal for the original game that does not incorporate communication or deliberation. Conversely, any Pareto-optimal outcome can be supported by a communication-deliberation process that leads to a stable coalition structure.

Reference-contexts: Coalition formation involves partitioning the agents into disjoint coalitions, solving the coordination problem within each coalition, and dividing the value or cost of each coalition among member agents. Coalition formation among self-interested agents has been widely studied in game theory <ref> [ 10; 5; 2; 1; 3; 4 ] </ref> . The main solution concepts are geared toward guaranteeing forms of stability of the coalition structure. These concepts focus on the final solution, and they usually do not address the dynamic process that leads to that solution.

This is in order to provide the coalition with a set of alter native utility divisions among member agents. The set contains only Pareto-optimal utility vectors: no agent can be made better off without making some other agent worse off. <p> Nash equilibrium does not account for the possibility that groups of agents (coalitions) can change their strategies in a coordinated manner. Aumann has introduced a strategic solution concept called the strong Nash equilibrium to address this issue <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> : Definition 8 A strategy profile s 2 Q n i=1 S i , in a game G, is a strong Nash equilibrium if for any T I and for all s T 2 j2T S j there exists an i 0 2 T such that u i

Recently, the coalition-proof Nash equilibrium <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> has been suggested as a partial remedy to this problem. This solution concept requires that there is no subgroup that can make a mutually beneficial deviation (keeping the strategies of nonmembers fixed) in a way that the deviation itself is stable according to the same criterion.
