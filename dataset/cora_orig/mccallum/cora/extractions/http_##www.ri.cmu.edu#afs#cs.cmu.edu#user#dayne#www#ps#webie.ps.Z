Abstract: Because the World Wide Web consists primarily of text, information extraction is central to any effort that would use the Web as a resource for knowledge discovery. We show how information extraction can be cast as a standard machine learning problem, and argue for the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The implementation of a general-purpose relational learner for information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document structure and the kinds of information available for use in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and other information is supplied as input in the form of an extensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV for use in learning extraction rules for a domain consisting of university course and research project pages sampled from the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involves adding several simple HTML-specific features to its basic feature set. There is a larger class of pages, however, which are regular in a more abstract sense. Many Web pages come from collections in which each page describes a single entity or event (e.g., home pages in a CS department; each describes its owner). The purpose of such a page is often to convey essential facts about the entity it describes. It is often reasonable to approach such a page with a set of standard questions, and to expect that the answers to these questions will be available as succinct text fragments in the page. A home page, for example, frequently lists the owner's name, affiliations, email address, etc. The problem of identifying the text fragments that answer standard questions defined for a document collection is called information extraction (IE) (Def 1995). Our interest in IE concerns the development of machine learning methods to solve it. We regard IE as a kind of text classification, which has strong affinities with the well-investigated problem of document classification, but also presents unique challenges. We share this focus with a number of other recent systems (Soderland 1996) (Califf & Mooney 1997), including a system designed to learn how to extract from HTML (Soderland 1997). In this paper we describe SRV, a top-down relational algorithm for information extraction. Central to the design of SRV is its reliance on a set of token-oriented features, which are easy to implement and add to the system. Since domain-specific information is contained within this features, which are separate from the core algorithm, SRV is better poised than similar systems for targeting to new domains. We have used it to perform extraction from electronic seminar announcements, medical abstracts, and newswire articles on corporate acquisitions. The experiments reported here show that targeting the system to HTML involves nothing more than the addition of HTML-specific features to its basic feature set. Consider a collection of Web pages describing university computer science courses. Given a page, a likely task for an information extraction system is to find the title of the course the page describes. We call the title a field and any literal title taken from an actual page, such as "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence," an in-stantiation or instance of the title field. Note that the typical information extraction problem involves multiple fields, some of which may have multiple instantia-tions in a given file. For example, a course page might

In both of these systems, rules are patterns which stipulate what must occur in and around field instances, and both systems generalize by starting with maximally specific patterns and gradually dropping constraints. Generalization is halted when a rule begins to accept too many negative examples.

Reference-contexts: In the two bottom-up systems discussed here, the features are implicit and entangled with the search heuristics. Soderland describes modifications which must be made to CRYSTAL, his learning system for IE, in order to use it for HTML <ref> (Soderland 1997) </ref>. CRYSTAL's assumption that text will be presented in sentence-sized chunks must be satisfied heuristically. How this segmentation is performed depends in part on the domain and requires manual engineering. In contrast, because SRV searches at the token level, it requires no modifications to be retargeted.
