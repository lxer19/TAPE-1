Abstract: In the robot navigation problem, noisy sensor data must be filtered to obtain the best estimate of the robot position. We propose using a Recursive Total Least Squares algorithm to obtain estimates of the robot position. We avoid several weaknesses inherent in the use of the Kalman and extended Kalman filters, achieving much faster convergence without good initial (a priori) estimates of the position. The performance of the method is illustrated both by simulation and on an actual mobile robot with a camera.

Davila [4] used a Kalman filter to obtain a fast update for the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.

In <ref> [5] </ref>, DeGroat used this approach combined with the averaging technique used in [19], again assuming that the singular values could be grouped into two clusters. Recently, Bose et al.[3] applied Davila's algorithm to reconstruct images from noisy, under-sampled frames after converting complex-valued image data into equivalent real data.

Reference-contexts: We seek a method that can obtain a good approximation to the TLS solution, but which admits rapid updating as new data samples arrive. One such method is the so-called ULV Decomposition, first introduced by Stewart <ref> [14] </ref> as a means to obtain an approximate SVD which can be easily updated as new data arrives, without making any a priori assumptions about the overall distribution of the singular values. <p> In this way, it is possible to track the leading r-dimensional "signal subspace" or the re maining "noise subspace" relatively cheaply. Details on the updating process can be found in <ref> [14, 9] </ref>.

Such instruments can give varying, incorrect readings in outdoor, unstructured environments <ref> [16] </ref>, so that it is useful to design and evaluate methods to obtain heading information from external sources. Such heading information could be used independently or as corrections to estimates from internal sources. The robot knows the location of the two landmarks on a map (ground coordinate system).

Reference-contexts: This second method is known in the statistical literature as orthogonal regression and in numerical analysis as total least squares (TLS) <ref> [17] </ref>. To demonstrate the algorithms, we use a mobile robot platform on which is mounted a camera. The sensor readings are obtained by viewing one or more landmarks in the visual images obtained as the robot moves. <p> The most common algorithms to compute the TLS solution are based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a non-recursive matrix decomposition which is computationally expensive to update. The TLS problem can be solved by the SVD using Algorithm 3.1 of <ref> [17] </ref>. The main computation cost of that algorithm occurs in the computation of the SVD. That cost is O (p 3 ) for each update. The basic solution method is sketched as follows. <p> If v p is too small or zero, then the TLS solution may be too big or nonexistent, in which case an approximate solution of reasonable size can be obtained by using the next smallest singular values (s) <ref> [17] </ref>. In cases such as the applications considered in this paper where the exact TLS solution is still corrupted by external effects such as noise, it suffices to obtain an approximate TLS solution at much less cost.

This eigenvector was then used to solve a symmetric TLS problem for the filter. <p> It was not explained how the algorithm might be modified for the case where the smallest eigenvalue is multiple (i.e., corresponding to a noise subspace of dimension higher than one), or variable (i.e., of unknown multiplicity). In <ref> [19] </ref>, Yu described a method for the fast update of an approximate eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix. <p> In [5], DeGroat used this approach combined with the averaging technique used in <ref> [19] </ref>, again assuming that the singular values could be grouped into two clusters.
