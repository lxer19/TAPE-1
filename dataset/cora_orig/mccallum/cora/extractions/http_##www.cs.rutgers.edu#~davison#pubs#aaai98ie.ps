Abstract: People display regularities in almost everything they do. This paper proposes characteristics of an idealized algorithm that would allow a user interface to adapt to an individual's pattern of use. We describe a simple predictive method with these characteristics and show its predictive accuracy on a large dataset of UNIX commands to be better than others that have been considered, while using fewer computational and memory resources. How predictable are you? Each of us displays patterns of actions throughout whatever we do. Most occur without conscious thought. Some patterns are widespread among large communities, and are taught, as rules, such as reading from left to right, or driving on the correct side of the road. Other patterns are a function of our lifestyle, such as picking up pizza on the way home from work every Friday, or programming the VCR to record our favorite comedy each week. Many are a result of the way interfaces are designed, like the pattern of movement of your finger on a phone dialing a number you call often, or how you might log into your computer, check mail, read news, and visit your favorite website for the latest sports scores. As computers pervade more and more aspects of our lives, the need for a system to be able to adapt to the user, perhaps in ways not programmed explicitly by the system's designer, will become ever more apparent. A car that can offer advice on driving routes is useful; one that can also guess your destination (such as a pizza parlor because it is Friday and you are leaving work) is likely to be found even more useful, particularly if you didn't have to program it explicitly with that knowledge. The ability to predict the user's next action allows the system to anticipate the user's needs (perhaps through speculative execution) and to adapt to and improve upon the user's work habits (such as automating repetitive tasks). Additionally, adaptive interfaces have also been shown to help those with This paper considers the more mundane, but present-day activities of user actions within a command line shell. We have concentrated initially on UNIX command prediction because of its continued widespread use; the UNIX shell provides an excellent testbed for experimentation and automatic data collection. However, our interest is in more general action prediction, and so we hypothesize that successful methodologies will also be applicable in other interfaces, including futuristic ones anticipated above as well as present-day menu selection in GUIs and voice-mail, or URL selection in web browsers. This paper, therefore, reflects our focus on the underlying technology for action prediction, rather than specifically on how prediction can be effectively used within an interface. In this paper, we use the data from two user studies to suggest that relatively naive methods can predict a particular user's next command surprisingly well. With the generic task in mind, we will describe the characteristics of an ideal algorithm for action prediction. Finally, we will present and analyze a novel algorithm that satisfies these characteristics and additionally performs better than the previous best-performing system. Technically, the problem addressed by this paper is that of multi-class sequence prediction in which the sequence is of nominal features. This type of problem is not studied often by machine learning researchers; concept recognition (i.e., the boolean classification task) is more common, as are independent samples from a distribution of examples. UNIX commands, and user actions in general, however, are not independent, and being nominal, don't fall into the domain of traditional time-series analysis techniques from statistics.
