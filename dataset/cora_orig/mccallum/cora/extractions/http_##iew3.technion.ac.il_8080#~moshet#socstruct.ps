The related work in these areas of research is especially concerned with the design of agents' roles and communication structures which enable a cooperative achievement of a common goal.

Reference-contexts: In a typical decentralized approach agents work individually and as a result conflicts may arrive. Therefore, the corresponding research concentrates on devising mechanisms for conflict resolution. Examples of such mechanisms include negotiations (Kraus and Wilkenfeld 1991), deals (Rosenschein and Genesereth 1985), consensus and decision on joint plans <ref> (Fischer et al. 1983, Dwork and Moses 1990) </ref>, etc. However, it seems incontroversial that such mechanisms by themselves are 3 not sufficient in order to achieve efficient multi-agent activity. The totally centralized and totally decentralized approaches are in fact extreme ones.

Reference-contexts: Common examples of a division of a society into sub-societies are the functional hierarchy and the centralized market organizational structures <ref> (see Malone 1987) </ref>. In the functional hierarchy there is a general (product) manager under which there are several functional managers. Each such functional manager is responsible for a task which is performed by several processors. <p> This includes work in the areas of organization theory <ref> (see Malone 16 1987) </ref>, team theory (Marschak and Radner 1972), and DAI (see for example Durfee et al. 1987, Fox 1981). The related work in these areas of research is especially concerned with the design of agents' roles and communication structures which enable a cooperative achievement of a common goal.

Reference-contexts: These laws might induce certain implicit organizational structures, and will take as given several organizational aspects of the society (such as the division of the society into sub-societies).

Reference-contexts: system, and a set of potential sets of focal states, find a useful hierarchical social law if one exits, or, if no such law exists, announce that this is the case. 14 The above definition extends in a precise sense the major and fundamental computational problem discussed in Section 2 <ref> (which by itself extends the treatment of Shoham and Tennenholtz 1992a) </ref>. If we take each sub-society to contain only one agent with a fixed set of focal states, then we get the framework discussed in Section 2.
