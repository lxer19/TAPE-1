Reference-contexts: The agent is initialized with the user's task (see below for examples) and transmitted by a message channel <ref> [22, 1] </ref>. The sending client may specify a destination service directly, but more likely it sends the agent initially to, for example, a Yellow Pages server, that can propose servers to be visited that are likely to be able to fulfill the user's task.

Reference-contexts: In the 1960s such schemes were employed to enable mini-computers to submit batch jobs on mainframes and to receive results, typically print files, back for local processing <ref> [2] </ref>. In the 1970s executable scripts were dispatched among networks of mini-computers to permit distributed, real-time processing [8]. Recently scripts have become a focus of attention. The concept of active mail has been used to enable widely available electronic mail services [3] to deliver executable scripts [19].

KQML can be viewed as providing a "package" layer to wrap around the transport of "content" such as might be described in KIF.

Reference-contexts: Why is this extended form of client-server computing desirable or valuable? There are many detailed motivations for using itinerant agents <ref> [5] </ref>, which fall broadly into two categories: 1) support for mobile computers or lightweight devices and 2) the emerging need in rapidly evolving networks for an asynchronous method of searching for information or transaction services. For example: 1.

Reference-contexts: These provide a basis for agent-server or agent-agent communication. Recent interest in on-demand electronic commerce is leading to the creation of public security services, such as TERISA the joint effort of RSA and EIT <ref> [6] </ref>. The emergence of standard, distributed object-oriented frameworks is another important enabler for mobile scripts. In such frameworks, the need to transport methods can often be greatly reduced, when common methods can be presumed to be remotely available.

In practice, the problem of writing a program that can verify the correct (or even simply non-malicious) behavior of another program is unsolved.

Reference-contexts: This section presents a brief overview of the basic security issues and concerns. We do not go into detail on the virus, maelstrom and emergent phenomena issues which arise from this computational framework. These issues deserve separate papers in their own rights. (See, for example, <ref> [9] </ref>.) The most fundamental security building block in an itinerant agent environment is the digital signature. Digital signatures are typically associated with public key cryptography 5 . The best-known and, by far, the most popular method of obtaining digital signatures is the RSA public key cryptosystem [23].

Reference-contexts: In some cases the ACL may be a knowledge representation language from the artificial intelligence community.

Reference-contexts: Universal certification is a lengthy and cumbersome process, mostly because it involves the establishment of a global certification hierarchy similar to that in the electronic mail milieu. (Privacy-Enhanced Mail, PEM <ref> [17] </ref>, is a case in point.) The good news is that certification hierarchies have been springing up in the last few years and there is no need to create a new hierarchy for the purpose of itinerant agents. <p> occupancy level, organizational affiliation, pricing, to name a few. * Agent's Privacy As alluded to above, it is impossible to keep an agent private unless its itinerary is known in advance. (In the latter case, the agent code can wrapped up and delivered as multi-destination secure email, as in PEM <ref> [17] </ref>.) Since one of the aesthetically appealing features of itinerant agents is precisely the freedom of movement, it is unrealistic to expect all agents to be launched with a set itinerary.

Reference-contexts: This model represents a very complex interaction governed by an auction protocol in which the agents' goals and monetary resources are hidden from other agents <ref> [24] </ref>. In the procurement model there are also the activities of strategy and electronic commerce. This model has many "sub models" such as electronic malls (many static agents and itinerant agents), flea markets (many itinerant agents), and sealed bidding auctions.
