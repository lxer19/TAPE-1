Abstract: This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation of temporal reference resolution in scheduling dialogs. The algorithm adopted is primarily a linear-recency based approach that does not include a model of global focus. A fully automatic system has been developed and evaluated on unseen test data with good results. This paper presents the results of an intercoder reliability study, a model of temporal reference resolution that supports linear recency and has very good coverage, the results of the system evaluated on unseen test data, and a detailed analysis of the dialogs assessing the viability of the approach.

Although we found domain knowledge and task-specific linguistic conventions most useful, we observed in the NMSU data some instances of potentially exploitable syntactic information to pursue in future work <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995, Sidner 1979) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In developing the algorithm, our approach was to start with a straightforward, recency-based approach and add complexity as needed to address problems encountered in the data. The algorithm does not include a mechanism for handling global focus <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>, for centering within a discourse segment (Sidner 1979; Grosz et al. 1995), or for performing tense and aspect interpretation. Instead, the algorithm processes anaphoric references with respect to an Attentional State (Grosz & Sidner 1986) structured as a linear list of all times mentioned so far in <p> The algorithm does not include a mechanism for handling global focus <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>, for centering within a discourse segment (Sidner 1979; Grosz et al. 1995), or for performing tense and aspect interpretation. Instead, the algorithm processes anaphoric references with respect to an Attentional State (Grosz & Sidner 1986) structured as a linear list of all times mentioned so far in the current dialog. The list is ordered by recency, no entries are ever deleted from the list, and there is no restriction on access.

Reference-contexts: Note that tense can influence the choice of whether to calculate a forward or a backward time from a frame of reference <ref> (Kamp & Reyle 1993) </ref>, but we do not account for this in our model due to the lack of tense variation in the corpora. Ex: Dialog date is Mon, 19th, Aug "How about Wednesday at 2?" interpreted as 2 pm, Wed 21 Aug The cases of anaphora considered: 1.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we annotated the seen training dialogs for anaphoric chains, to support analysis of the data. A fully automatic system has been developed that takes as input the ambiguous output of a semantic parser <ref> (Lavie & Tomita 1993, Levin et al. 1995) </ref>. The system performance on unseen, held-out test data is good, especially on the CMU data, showing the usefulness of our straightforward approach.

Reference-contexts: Determining all of the temporal information that is being conveyed can be important for many interpretation tasks. For instance, in machine translation, knowing the temporal context is important in translating sentences with missing information. This is particularly useful when dealing with noisy data, as with spoken input <ref> (Levin et al. 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For the current not-yet-resolved Temporal Unit, each rule is applied. For the anaphoric rules, the antecedent considered is the most recent one meeting the conditions. All consistent maximal mergings of the results are formed, and the one with the highest score is the chosen interpretation. 4.1 Architecture Following <ref> (Qu et al. 1996) </ref> and (Shum et al. 1994), the representation of a single utterance is called an ILT (for InterLingual Text). An ILT, once it has been augmented by our system with temporal (and speech-act) information, is called an augmented ILT (an AILT). <p> In particular, for each input sequence of ILTs, it produces a sequence of AILTs and then chooses the best sequence for the corresponding utterances. In this way, the input ambiguity is resolved as a function of finding the best temporal interpreta tions of the utterance sequences in context <ref> (as sug-gested in Qu et al. 1996) </ref>. A focus list keeps track of what has been discussed so far in the dialog.

Reference-contexts: As will be shown in the next section, very few errors can be attributed to the wrong entities being in focus due to not handling subdialogs or "multiple threads" <ref> (Rose et al. 1995) </ref>. 6 Global Focus The algorithm is conspicuously lacking in any mechanism for recognizing the global structure of the discourse, such as in Grosz & Sidner (1986), Mann & Thompson (1988), Allen & Perrault (1980), and their descendants.

Reference-contexts: In determining the candidates from which to choose the antecedent, for each type of anaphoric relation, the algorithm considers only the most recent antecedent for which that relationship can be established. The algorithm was primarily developed on a corpus of Spanish dialogs collected under the JANUS project <ref> (Shum et al. 1994) </ref> (referred to hereafter as the "CMU dialogs") and has also been applied to a corpus of Spanish dialogs collected under the Artwork project (Wiebe et al. 1996) (hereafter referred to as the "NMSU dialogs"). <p> For the anaphoric rules, the antecedent considered is the most recent one meeting the conditions.

Reference-contexts: How ever, as they have limited knowledge of Spanish, in essence they annotated the English translations. The subjects annotated two training dialogs according to the instructions. After receiving feedback, they annotated four unseen test dialogs. Inter-coder reliability was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistic () <ref> (Siegel & Castellan 1988, Carletta 1996) </ref>. is calculated as follows, where the numerator is the average percentage agreement among the annotators (Pa) less a term for chance agreement (Pe), and the denominator is 100% agreement less the same term for chance agreement (Pe): = 1 P e (For details on calculating

Reference-contexts: The different findings may also be due to differences in the data: although their scheduling dialogs were collected under similar protocols, their protocol is like a radio conversation in which a button must be pressed in order to transmit, resulting in less dynamic interaction and longer turns <ref> (Villa 1994) </ref>. An important discourse feature of the dialogs is the degree of redundancy of the times mentioned (Walker 1996).

Reference-contexts: An important discourse feature of the dialogs is the degree of redundancy of the times mentioned <ref> (Walker 1996) </ref>. This limits the ambiguity of the times specified, and it also leads to a higher level of robustness, since additional DE's with the same time are placed on the focus list. These "backup" DE's might be available in case the rule applications fail on the most recent DE.
