Abstract: Location management is one of the most important issues in distributed mobile computing. Location management consists of location updates, searches and search-updates. An update occurs when a mobile host changes location. A search occurs when a host wants to communicate with a mobile host whose location is unknown to the requesting host. A search-update occurs after a successful search, when the requesting host updates the location information corresponding to the mobile host. Various strategies can be designed for search, update and search-update. Static location management uses one combination of search, update and search-update strategies throughout the execution. Simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of different static location management strategies for various communication and mobility patterns. It was noticed that performing search-updates significantly reduced the search costs with very little cost to pay for updates (upon moves and searches). In order to obtain good performance using static location management, the system designer should a priori have a fair idea of the communication and the mobility pattern of the users. Having this information, the system designer can select the combination which performs best for the given values of communication and mobility. The host behavior (communication frequency, mobility) is not always available to the system designer. Thus, there is a need for dynamic location management. In this paper we present a scheme for dynamic location management. The basic philosophy behind dynamic management is that the past history of the system will reflect the behavior in the future. Hence, by keeping track of the past history and modifying the management strategy accordingly, one expects to perform well for any call and mobility pattern. Simulation results show that the performance of dynamic location management is better than static location management. fl Preliminary version will appear in the Proceedings of Third International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems, 1994.

Reference-contexts: As shown in Figure 1, mobile networks generally comprise of a static backbone network and a wireless network. There are two distinct sets of entities, namely mobile hosts and fixed hosts. A host that can move while retaining its network connection is called a mobile host (mh) <ref> [1] </ref>. The static network comprises of the fixed hosts and the communication links between them. Some of the fixed hosts, called mobile support stations (MSS) 1 are augmented with a wireless interface, and, they provide a gateway for communication between the wireless network and the static network. <p> This region is referred to as a mobile support station's cell. The geographical area covered by a cell is a function of the medium used for wireless communication. Currently, the average size of a cell is of the order of 1-2 miles in diameter <ref> [1] </ref>. As the demand for services increase, the number of cells may become insufficient to provide the required grade of service. Cell splitting [15] can then be used to increase the traffic handled in an area without increasing the bandwidth of the system.

Reference-contexts: They also use forwarding pointers. Regional matching directories are used to enable localized updates and searches. Badrinath et. al. examined strategies that reduced search costs and at the same time control the volume of location updates by employing user profiles <ref> [2] </ref>. The architecture consists of a hierarchy L of location servers which are connected to themselves and to the base stations (or mobile support stations) by a static network. Each user is assumed to be registered under one of the location servers called the home location server (H LS).

Reference-contexts: Fowler proposed the use of forwarding pointers to keep track of these objects. As explained later, our paper borrows the idea of manipulating forwarding pointers upon a successful search. Awerbuch et. al. proposed a theoretical model for online tracking of mobile hosts <ref> [3] </ref>. The architecture is assumed to be a hierarchy of "m-regional matching directories". Each node u in the data-structure maintains sets read (u) and write (u).

Reference-contexts: Cell splitting [15] can then be used to increase the traffic handled in an area without increasing the bandwidth of the system. In future, the cells are expected to be very small (less than 10 meters in diameter) covering the interior of a building <ref> [4] </ref>. A mobile host communicates with one mobile support station (MSS) at any given time. MSS is responsible for forwarding data between the mobile host (mh) and static network. Due to mobility, mh may cross the boundary between two cells while being active. <p> Due to mobility, mh may cross the boundary between two cells while being active. Thus, the task of forwarding data between the static network and the mobile host must be transferred to the new cell's mobile support station. This process, known as handoff, is transparent to the mobile user <ref> [4] </ref>. The initiative for a handoff can come 1 Mobile support stations are sometimes called base stations. 3 from the mobile host or the mobile support stations.

Reference-contexts: The cost of a location update and search is characterized by the number of messages sent, size of messages and the distance the messages need to travel. An efficient location management strategy should attempt to minimize all of these parameters. Providing connection-oriented services <ref> [5, 6, 7, 8, 12] </ref> to the mobile hosts requires that the host be always connected to the rest of the network in such a manner that its movements are transparent to the users.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 presents the dynamic location management scheme and conclusions are presented in Section 7. 2 Review of Related Literature Numerous location strategies have been proposed in the recent years. One of the earlier works which dealt with object tracking was done in 1986 by Fowler <ref> [10] </ref>. Fowler deals with techniques to efficiently use forwarding addresses for finding decentralized objects. The environment is an object-oriented computer system, where the objects are allowed to move between processes. If a process wants to perform an operation on an object, it has to first locate it.

Reference-contexts: As the number of hosts in a network increase, it might not be efficient to have a dedicated user agent per user. Wu et. al. dealt with the idea of caching location data at the Internet Access Point (I AP ) <ref> [11] </ref>. Here, the I AP will maintain location data of some of the hosts. This becomes useful when optimal routing decisions are to be taken.

Thus, the problem of location management basically focuses on the management of the address matching table.

Reference-contexts: When the user crosses partitions, does the update takes place. As explained later, our paper uses a similar architecture, but, does not assume a home location server (HLS). Spreitzer et. al. proposed a network architecture which consists of user agents, and a location query service (LQS) <ref> [14] </ref>. The paper deals with tracking of hosts and providing some privacy to the user. The user agents are responsible to forward any communication to or from the user. There is a dedicated user agent per user.
