Title: Multiframe Structure from Motion in Perspective  
Author: John Oliensis 
Address: 4 Independence Way Princeton, N.J. 08540  
Affiliation: NEC Research Institute  
Abstract: A new approach to multiframe structure from motion for point features is presented. Unlike previous approaches, it gives robust reconstruction in situations commonly encountered in outdoor robot navigation, for general motion and with large perspective effects. Under the appropriate conditions, the algorithm provably gives the correct reconstruction. The typical computation time is seconds. It is argued that the new approach, combined with previous algorithms valid in other domains (e.g., Tomasi's algorithm), gives a general method for structure from motion.

Reference-contexts: Finding the structure and motion by minimizing (18) rather than TrD H D t H eliminates all bias in the estimate due to singling out the base frame for special treatment. This distinguishes our approach from earlier work such as <ref> [1] </ref>. The inverse square root of C H can be computed ex actly: it is [C H ] hh 0 = ffi hh 0 N 1 Define D CH C 1=2 H D H and similarly T C (x;y;z) C H T (x;y;z) .

Reference-contexts: It is valid for general motion 1 . There is no restriction on the depth variations of 3D feature points, in contrast with the approach due to Tomasi and its extensions <ref> [25, 27, 17, 2] </ref>. <p> The basic approach reported here (though not the details of the general motion algorithm) was previ ously described in [16] and [15]; the current paper is partly based upon these previous ones. 2 Background and Motivation The approach most similar in spirit to ours is Tomasi's <ref> [25, 27, 17, 2] </ref>. Like ours, his algorithm and its extensions are based on using all data to compute a good approximation to the MLE. However, the domain of validity of his approximation and algorithm differs from that of our algorithm. <p> A more useful description is: Tomasi's algorithm and extensions are valid when the viewed 3D points are closely clumped in depth compared to their depths relative to the cameras. Recently, Christy and Ho-raud <ref> [2] </ref> proposed an algorithm which, similar to the one described here, iteratively corrects for the approximations inherent in Tomasi's approach. This algorithm may be capable of producing exact, robust estimates for structure and motion within its domain of validity, which is the same as for Tomasi's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: For these cases the algorithm presented here must be modified. We have already presented results for real and synthetic sequences using appropriately modified algorithms in [16, 15]. The real image se quences used were the UMASS PUMA [20] and the Martin-Marietta Rocket Field sequence <ref> [3] </ref>. We have also shown experimentally that it is possible to distinguish which method is appropriate directly from the data. For instance, it is easy to determine that the translational motion is not general if D CH has fewer than three leading singular values.

Reference-contexts: The surviving first order terms will then involve only the translation and the structure. The appropriate matrix can be computed using Householder matrices. The Householder matrix <ref> [4] </ref> H ab is an orthogonal matrix that takes a to b by a reflection. With ^ n (0; 0 : : : 1) t , the matrix defined by the first n 1 rows of H a^n is a rank n 1 matrix annihilating ^ n.

Reference-contexts: Other algorithms either require small perspective effects as in Tomasi's approach, or else use a small amount of the available information (typically 2 or 3 image frames) <ref> [21, 22, 18, 13, 5, 6, 24] </ref> and thus are not robust when more is needed. Our algorithm is also fast. <p> Our algorithm is not limited to infinitesimal motions but gives exact answers for finite motions. Recently, much research in structure from motion has focused on reconstruction from two or three image frames <ref> [21, 22, 18, 13, 5, 6] </ref>, or else from a small number of feature points tracked across many images [24]. We call such methods frugal, because they use just a fraction of the information potentially available in MFSFM when there are many ( 3) images.

Reference-contexts: In our experiments, the rotation error after its recovery in the initial step of our algorithm is less than 5 ffi -10 ffi . In the next stages of our algorithm, the first order effect of the rotation error is canceled by a technique similar to that of <ref> [7, 23] </ref>. Then the effect of the rotation error is second order in and is relatively insignificant. <p> Matrices annihilating multiple vectors can be computed by taking appropriate products of matrices derived in this way. The linear elimination of rotation dependence was first proposed by Heeger and Jepson <ref> [9, 7, 11] </ref> in the quite different context of recovering motion from op tical flow. However, their technique did not extend simply to annihilating general vectors or to sparse flows [10] whereas our Householder-based method does.

Reference-contexts: This method uses the vector image displacements to calculate the rotation, rather than just those components orthogonal to the translational displacements as in some previous work <ref> [12] </ref>. It is possible here to use the full information in the image displacements because the structure as well as the translational motion have been reliably calculated in the previous step.

This is a sequence where there is not enough information to recover all components of the Euclidean structure accurately. However, our Eu-clidean algorithm does recover most components of the structure accurately: in other words it recovers the affine structure. The additonal structure components are recovered inaccurately. <p> Rather, the translational motion tends to be along a ground plane and is frequently predominantly in a single direction.

Since the singular subspaces overdetermine the structure and translations, the second stage generally introduces little additional error sensitivity.
