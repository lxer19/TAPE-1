Abstract: Visual servoing, i.e. the use of the vision sensor in feedback control, has been of increasing interest. Work has been done by applications in autonomous driving, manipulation, mobile robot navigation and surveillance. However, the theoretical aspects of the problem have not received much attention. Furthermore, the problem of estimation from the vision measurements has been considered separately from the design of the control strategies. Instead of addressing the estimation and control problems separately, we attempt to characterize the types of control tasks which can be achieved using only the quantities directly measurable in the image, bypassing the estimation phase. We consider the navigation task for a nonholonomic ground mobile base tracking an arbitrarily shaped continuous ground curve. This tracking problem is formulated as one of controlling the shape of the curve in the image plane. We study the controllability of the system characterizing the dynamics of the image curve, and show that the shape of the image curve is controllable only up to its "linear" curvature parameters. We present stabilizing control laws for tracking piecewise analytic curves, and propose to track arbitrary curves by approximating them by piecewise "linear" curvature curves. Simulation results are given for these control schemes. The observability of the curve dynamics by using direct measurements from vision sensors as the outputs is studied and an Extended Kalman Filter is proposed to dynamically estimate the image quantities needed for the feedback controls from the actual noisy images.

Reference-contexts: Further extensions of this approach for nonholonomic mobile platforms has been made by Pissard-Gibollet and Rives [16]. Generalization of the curve tracking and estimation problem outlined in Dickmanns for arbitrarily shaped curves addressing both the estimation of the shape parameters as well as control has been explored in <ref> [6] </ref> by Frezza and Picci. They used an approximation of an arbitrary curve by a spline, and proposed a scheme for recursive estimation of shape parameters of the curve, and designed control laws for tracking the curve. <p> z cos )! + @y 3 A k (y) kk is the (k; k) entry of the matrix A k (y). 4 This equation is called a Riccati-type PDE since it generalizes the classical well-known Riccati equation for the motion of a homogeneous straight line under rotation around the origin <ref> [6] </ref> [7]. 8 Using the notation ~ from (11) and the expression (8) for fl z , this partial differential equation can be transformed to an infinite-dimensional dynamic system ~ through differentiating equation (21) with respect to y repeatedly: 0 B B B B B _ ~ 1 _ ~ 3 <p> Therefore, piecewise linear curvature curves are simple as well as good models for most tracking tasks. Comments Strictly speaking, when approximating a given curve by a piecewise polynomial curve, for example by using splines <ref> [6] </ref>, in order to get the estimate of ~ for the evolution of the approximating virtual curve, one has to solve the infinite-dimensional differential equation (22). <p> Basically, there are two different approaches that one might take in order to track such a curve: first, one may use some estimation schemes and based on the estimated features of the real curve to apply the feedback control law (as studied by Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>); second, one may just smoothly connect these chunks of the image curve by straight lines, arcs or linear curvature curves and then apply the virtual tracking scheme as given above to track the approximating virtual curves. 4.3 Simulation Results of Tracking Ground Curves In this section, we show simulation results <p> In other words, one has to approximate by simpler curve models which have finite-dimensional dynamics. In Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>, the models chosen are third-order B-splines. However, as we have pointed out in Section 2.2.3, the polynomial form is not an intrinsic property of a curve and it cannot be preserved under the motion of the mobile robot. <p> Although, in some sense, both linear curvature curves and third-order B-splines (Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>) are third-order approximations for general curves, the dimension of the Kalman filter for estimating the B-spline parameters is N + 2 where N is the number of measurements. However, the EKF we propose here is only 4-dimensional. <p> We propose that linear curvature curves are very good candidates for such models. In some sense, linear curvature curves are a third-order approximation for general curves, so are third-order B-splines used by Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>. However, the Extended Kalman Filters needed to estimate their parameters are 4-dimensional and (N + 2)-dimensional respectively (where N is the number of output measurements). The computation intensities of the two schemes therefore are different.
