Abstract: Many collections of scientific data in particular disciplines are available today around the world. Much of this data conforms to some agreed upon standard for data exchange, i.e., a standard schema and its semantics. However, sharing this data among a global community of users is still difficult because of a lack of standards for the following necessary functions: (i) data providers need a standard for describing or publishing available sources of data; (ii) data administrators need a standard for discovering the published data and (iii) users need a standard for accessing this discovered data. This paper describes a prototype implementation of a system, WebSemantics, that accomplishes the above tasks. We describe an architecture and protocols for the publication, discovery and access to scientific data. We define a language for discovering sources and querying the data in these sources, and we provide a formal semantics for this language.

Reference-contexts: Distributed information retrieval systems, for example the Harvest/Essence information retrieval based system <ref> [B + 95] </ref> are indirectly related to our work. Essence is a customizable information extraction system that is used to extract and structure mostly textual information from documents in Harvest. It exploits the formats of common file types and extracts contents of files.

In order to access this information, the WebSemantics system needs to locate these pages and extract the source connection information from them.

Reference-contexts: For example, governments have recognized that information about the environment has important consequences in the management of sustainable economic growth. As a result, many collections of environmental data, located around the world, are now available to scientists <ref> [Fra97] </ref>. Much of this data conforms to existing standards for the definition of data. These standards help scientists share information since each item of data is precisely defined. However, the sharing of information between scientists is still a very difficult process.

Reference-contexts: WebSemantics differs in two distinct ways from these systems. Wrappers developed for Garlic [HKWY97] and the Information Manifold [KLSS95] assume the location of the data sources, types, and wrapper capability, are embedded within the wrappers. Wrappers for DISCO [TRV96] and TSIMMIS <ref> [GM + 95, VP97] </ref> use declarative languages to export types and query capabilities. The location of components is embedded within the mediators.

Another Web query language, W3QS <ref> [KS95] </ref> includes the specification of syntax and semantics of a SQL-like query language (W3QL) that provides simple access to external Unix programs, advanced display facilities for gathered information, and view maintenance facilities.

WebSQL <ref> [MMM96] </ref> integrates textual retrieval with structure and topology-based queries. There, a minimal ist relational approach is taken: each Web document is associated with a tuple in a virtual Document relation and each hypertext link with a tuple in a virtual Anchor relation.
