Abstract: Given a linear time-invariant control system, it is well known that the transmission zeroes are the generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil. Adding outputs to place additional zeroes is equivalent to appending rows to this pencil to place new generalized eigenvalues. Adding inputs is likewise equivalent to appending columns. Since both problems are dual to each other, we only show in this paper how to choose the new rows to place the new zeroes in any desired locations. The process involves the extraction of the individual right Kronecker blocks of the pencil, accomplished entirely with unitary transformations. In particular, when adding one new output, i.e. appending a single row, the maximum number of new zeroes that can be placed is exactly the largest right Kronecker index.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The placement of transmission of zeroes via synthesis of new outputs and/or inputs has been studied from the point of view of system theory, and certain algorithms have been developed <ref> [8, 9, 1, 11] </ref>. <p> In [8, 9] an algorithm to synthesize outputs to assign the zeroes was proposed based on the desired form of the transfer function. In <ref> [1] </ref>, a method was proposed to assign zeroes for a SISO system as well as to assign zeroes to the input/output maps from individual inputs to individual outputs. In this paper, we study this problem using the Kronecker theory of pencils [5]. <p> We show how additional rows or columns can be appended to a pencil to place as many zeroes as possible, and discuss the limits on this placement. Like <ref> [1, 11] </ref>, our approach ends up reducing the problem to a problem of pole placement, for which several algorithms are available (see e.g. [7, 10]). <p> We propose a new extension to this algorithm, still based on unitary transformations, which can actually extract the individual Kronecker blocks. Once the individual Kronecker blocks have been extracted, the zeroes may be placed within each Kronecker block in a manner very similar in spirit to that of <ref> [1] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. First we describe the basic theory that relates the Kronecker theory of matrix pencils to the problem of placing zeroes or more generally placing the generalized eigenvalues for a pencil. <p> Do likewise on the F (1;1) (2;1) The final form of this process is Q L (G <ref> [1] </ref> F [1] )Q R = (G [2] F [2] ) = B G 11 G 1k . . .

Reference-contexts: The algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage, we essentially compute the generalized Schur form (3), separating the left Kronecker part from the regular part and the right Kronecker part. This can be carried out using the staircase algorithm <ref> [12, 2] </ref> and we will not discuss this process in detail. In the second stage, we extract the individual Kronecker blocks, via a new elimination procedure proposed in this paper. Finally, in the third stage we compute the rows to be appended in order to place the zeroes. <p> The zero placing part also enjoys a backward stability property, hence the numerical stability of the whole process is favorable. The broad steps of the process is as follows. Algorithm 1. Zero Placement. 1. Use the staircase algorithm <ref> [12, 2] </ref> to extract the left and right Kronecker part from the pencil. Assume the left Kronecker part of the pencil is the m fi n pencil G l F l , with n = m + k. <p> presence of a regular part can be determined by the staircase algorithm, except that it may not be as numerically reliable as the approach in [3]. (This is still an open area of research.) The algorithm used to extract the left and right Kronecker part is the variant described in <ref> [2] </ref> to which we refer the reader for all the details, particularly on how to handle the presence of a regular part or left Kronecker blocks. <p> Finally, we need to use a variant of the above form where the square matrices F i;i+1 are upper-triangular and the rectangular matrices G i;i have leading zero columns and a trailing upper-triangular matrix. This form can always be obtained as explained in <ref> [2] </ref> and will be exploited in the subsequent steps. 3.2 Extract Individual Kronecker Blocks The next step is to extract the individual Kronecker blocks. <p> Do likewise on the F (1;1) (2;1) The final form of this process is Q L (G [1] F [1] )Q R = (G <ref> [2] </ref> F [2] ) = B G 11 G 1k . . .

We now give certain inequalities which will lead to the main result. Theorem 1.
