Abstract: The utility of Lanczos methods for the approximation of large-scale dynamical systems is considered. In particular, it is shown that the Lanczos method is a technique for yielding Pade approximants which has several advantages over more traditional explicit moment matching approaches. An extension of the Lanczos algorithm is developed for computing multi-point Pade approximations of descriptor systems. fl

Reference-contexts: The Hankel matrix, M, containing the moments will become nearly singular. And regardless of how many additional moments are supposedly matched in this situation, the computed approximation never converges to the original one (see <ref> [1, example 1] </ref>). To contend with this difficulty, [1] suggests working around the problem by attempting to modify the expansion frequency, s 0 . <p> The Hankel matrix, M, containing the moments will become nearly singular.

To contend with this difficulty, <ref> [1] </ref> suggests working around the problem by attempting to modify the expansion frequency, s 0 . If forming a certain type of moment emphasizes an extreme eigenvalue of A, one must select other types of moments which emphasize information from other portions of the spectrum.

Reference-contexts: But in fact, these concepts can be taken one step further by noting that one is really only interested in that information in e At b which lies in the direction of c (one ultimately desires ky ^yk small for some desired range of inputs u).

In particular, these papers begin to investigate the use of an oblique Krylov projector (i.e., the Lanczos algorithm) for generating the reduced-order system f ^ A; ^ b; ^ cg. <p> However, the techniques for choosing the expansion frequencies are still rather heuristic; a more formal approach should be explored in future work. The Lanczos method must also still be extended to the multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) case. Block versions of the Lanczos method are already in existence, see <ref> [2] </ref> for example. But the extension of look-ahead to handle the breakdowns in MIMO Lanczos remains an open issue. Finally, we note that the inversion of (A s i E) is an area requiring additional work.

Reference-contexts: For example, asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) is a recently developed technique for acquiring low-order Pade approximations for large, linearized circuits [19]. However, existing AWE papers do not link Krylov projectors and Pade ap-proximation together. 2. Pade approximation with Lanczos methods In conventional Pade techniques <ref> [5] </ref>, an approximation for the dynamical system (1) is typically obtained through a two-step process. First, moments which correspond to frequency domain expansions of the circuit's impulse response are explicitly computed.

Recall that the V k and W k matrices resulting from the standard Lanczos method each corresponded to a single Krylov space. In the rational Lanczos method, multiple Krylov spaces are computed. Each space corresponds to an expansion frequency s i . <p> Proof: see <ref> [8] </ref>. Thus the projection resulting from the rational Lanc-zos method satisfies the multi-point condition of (9). It also would appear that the benefits of the standard Lanc-zos method (e.g., avoiding a power method, look-ahead) can be easily extended to the rational Lanczos approach. 4.

Reference-contexts: Example As a brief example of the utility of multi-point Pade approximations, we will study the 120 th order system which describes the effects of a magnetic actuator on the radial tracking arm of a portable compact disc player, see <ref> [12] </ref>. s 0 = 1 (dashed line), a 12 th order Pade approximation about s 0 = 0 (dotted line) and a 6 th order multi-point Pade approximation (dashed-dotted line) for the CD player. <p> The multi-point approximation is stable and its impulse response recreates that of the original system with great precision. The Pade approximation about s 0 = 0 identifies those modes corresponding to the low-frequency peak but its impulse response is unstable. However, the techniques of <ref> [12] </ref> can stabilize the s 0 = 0 approximation so that the s 0 = 0 response to an impulse (which may or may not be the input of interest for a given application) follows that of the original system with great precision.
