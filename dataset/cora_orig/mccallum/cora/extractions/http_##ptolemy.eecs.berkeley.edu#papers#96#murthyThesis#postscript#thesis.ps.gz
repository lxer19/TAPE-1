Abstract: In this thesis, we present various scheduling techniques for programs expressed as Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) and Multidimensional Synchronous dataflow graphs. Synchronous dataflow has proven efficient as a specification model for block-diagram based programming environments for signal processing. Two key reasons for its popularity are that a) static schedules can be constructed at compile time, thus eliminating the overhead due to dynamic scheduling, and b) it models multirate signal processing application very naturally and intuitively. The first property is particularly important in environments where code-synthesis for embedded processors is desirable, since embedded signal processing applications have rigid throughput requirements in order to meet hard-real-time constraints. Multidimensional Synchronous Dataflow (MDSDF) is an extension of SDF to multiple dimensions; in this model, applications such as image and video signal processing, which operate on multidimensional signal spaces, are more naturally modeled and specified than in SDF. The amount of on-chip memory available on embedded processors is often severely limited. Adding off-chip memory is usually not an option because it entails a speed penalty, it increases overall system cost and size, and increases power requirements. Thus, when generating software implementations from SDF specifications for a uniprocessor, the scheduling problem of minimizing code size and buffer memory size becomes crucial. If the scheduling is not done carefully, the blowup in the size of the implementation can
