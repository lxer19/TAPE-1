Abstract: This manuscript is a submission to the workshop "Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning for Manufacturing". It introduces and positions our part in a project and motivates our approach with respect to reinforcement learning and manufacturing processes. In an "extended appendix" some additional information will be given about our problem domain and preliminary results. Our main issue is that advances in algorithms and theory should not be scaled up to bigger problems, but to more realistic problems. Realistic in the sense that the problem is formulated with the problems of existing man ufacturing processes in mind.

Reference-contexts: Our group investigates the possible use of reinforcement learning as control technique. The use of reinforcement learning techniques to control and optimize manufacturing processes, was successfully demonstrated in <ref> [3] </ref>. There it was applied to the manufacturing process for thermoplastic composite structures. In spite of the successful demonstration, the use of reinforcement learning to control manufacturing processes is still not commonplace. The reason for this is that there are still some barriers to take.
