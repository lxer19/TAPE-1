Abstract: We approach stock selection for long/short portfolios from the perspective of knowledge discovery in databases and rule induction: given a database of historical information on some universe of stocks, discover rules from the data that will allow one to predict which stocks are likely to have exceptionally high or low returns in the future. Long/short portfolios allow a fund manager to independently address value-added stock selection and factor exposure, and are a popular tool in financial engineering. For stock selection we employed the Recon 1 system, which is able to induce a set of rules to model the data it is given. We evaluate Recon's stock selection performance by using it to build equitized long/short portfolios over eighteen quarters of historical data from October 1988 to March 1993, repeatedly using the previous four quarters of data to build a model which is then used to rank stocks in the current quarter. When trading costs were taken into account, Recon's equitized long/short portfolio had a total return of 277%, significantly outperforming the benchmark (S&P500), which returned 92.5% over the same period 2 . We conclude that rule induction is a valuable tool for stock selection.

Reference-contexts: Any modeling tool used for money management should produce a comprehensible model. With millions of real dollars at stake, the ability to understand and interact with the model is a necessity. Neural networks are very popular with quantitative managers, but their opacity makes them a less than ideal tool <ref> (Barr & Bhagat 1994) </ref>. We believe that Recon's ability to discover patterns and present them as easily understood rules, explain why it included certain rules, interact with an analyst to modify the rules, and explain its predictions, makes it an excellent tool for financial modeling and stock selection.

Reference-contexts: Without expressing constraints on factor exposures, a long/short portfolio may easily be more risky than a simple long portfolio. For example, going long in airline stocks (which are highly negatively correlated with oil prices) and short on oil stocks effectively places a double bet that oil prices will drop <ref> (Bensman 1995) </ref>. Quantitative models are essential here|a manager needs to supply predicted returns on a large number of stocks so that she can actually find positive excess return portfolios meeting strict exposure constraints.

Since many of the long positions might have offsetting short positions with similar factor exposures, the major source of return is uncorrelated with broad market moves.

Reference-contexts: We present a quantitative modeling system, Recon, with roots in the research communities of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Statistics. The system has previously been shown to create long portfolios with excess return of 3.5% per quarter over four and a half years <ref> (John, Miller & Kerber 1996) </ref>. Because of the relative unpopularity of short-selling and thus less efficient pricing, we hope to find even better results using Recon to build long/short portfolios. <p> As the size of the selection universe grows, either the analysis staff must grow commensurately, or quantitative methods must be employed. 3 The Recon System The Recon system (Simoudis, Livezey & Kerber 1994, Simoudis, Livezey & Kerber 1995) is an integrated system for the exploration and analysis of large databases <ref> (John et al. 1996) </ref>. The exploratory tools allow a user to graphically define concepts and new features, and to visualize data. The principal analytical tool is a rule induction system developed at Lockheed-Martin. <p> In previous work with Recon we observed an excess return of 144% during the period October 1988 March 1993, also using 1% round-trip costs. The appropriate benchmark was custom-designed but very close to S&P 500 <ref> (John et al. 1996) </ref>. 6 Conclusion For many significant reasons, long/short equity management is growing in popularity. When subject to a number of risk controls, such strategies typically require quantitative models for estimating future excess returns. Any modeling tool used for money management should produce a comprehensible model.

Reference-contexts: Hennessee (1994) shows that this phenomenon is even stronger when looking at "downside risk." Practically, because of low short-selling volume (only 3% of NYSE and NASDAQ volume as of late 1993), underperforming stocks are likely to be less efficiently priced, leaving more room for profit by astute short pickers <ref> (Price 1989, Dravo 1993) </ref>. The ability to short-sell gives a manager more freedom. For example, a long-only manager might strongly believe that a company, which constitutes 2% of her benchmark, will go bankrupt. The only way she can express this belief is to not hold the stock at all.

Management costs are typically high compared with long-only portfolios, due to the added complexity in portfolio maintenance. 2.1 Mechanics and Costs The following small example should provide a concrete depiction of long/short mechanics for readers new to the idea.

Reference-contexts: Jacobs & Levy (1993) suggest the S&P 500 as a benchmark for the equitized long/short portfolio and Treasury bills for the long/short portfolio. Indeed, they manage a long/short fund and are actually compensated based on their performance relative to Tbills <ref> (White 1991) </ref>. However, the Recon long/short portfolio had much higher volatility than Tbills (6.71% vs. 0.49%), so we instead use combinations of S&P futures and Tbills to construct custom benchmarks with the same risk as the two Recon portfolios.
