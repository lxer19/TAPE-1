Title: The wearable remembrance agent: a system for augmented memory

Abstract: This paper describes the wearable Remembrance Agent, a continuously running proactive memory aid that uses the physical context of a wearable computer to provide notes that might be relevant in that context. A currently running prototype is described, along with future directions for research inspired by using the prototype.

Reference-contexts: It also provides the ability to tag future events, such as meeting times, that trigger alarms shortly before they occur. Finally, several systems exist to recommend web-pages based on the pages a user is currently browsing [Lieberman, 1995] <ref> [Armstrong et al., 1995] </ref>. 6 Design issues and future work The physical-based tags are a recent extension to the RA, but the base system has been up and running on the wearable platform for several months, and several design issues are already apparent from using this prototype.

Reference-contexts: Several systems also exist to provide contextual cues for managing information on a traditional desktop system.

It also provides the ability to tag future events, such as meeting times, that trigger alarms shortly before they occur.

Reference-contexts: To retrieve the whole text described in a summary line, the wearer hits a quick chord on a chording keyboard. 3.1 The Desktop RA An earlier desktop version of the RA is described in <ref> [Rhodes and Starner, 1996] </ref>. This previous version suggests old email, papers, or other text documents that are relevant to whatever file is currently being written or read in a word-processor.

Reference-contexts: The indexing method used here is the same used for the previous version of the RA, and is based on the SMART algorithm described in <ref> [Salton, 1971] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The current design shows an entire 80 column by 25 row screen, but this often produces too much text for a wearer to scan while still trying to carry on a conversation. Future versions will experiment with variable font size and animated typography <ref> [Small et al., 1994] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is currently running under Linux on a wearable 100MHz 486 based on the "Tin Lizzy" design developed by Thad Starner <ref> [Starner et al., 1995a] </ref>. The input device is a one-handed chording keyboard called the Twiddler (made by Handykey), with which one can reach typing speeds of 30-50 words per minute on a full-function keyboard.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, the context of a remembered episode provides lots of cues for recall later. These cues include the physical location of an event, who was there, what was happening at the same time, and what happened immediately before and after <ref> [Tulving, 1983] </ref>. This information both helps us recall events given a partial context, and to associate our current environment with past experiences that might be related. Until recently, computers have only had access to a user's current context within a computational task, but not outside of that environment.
