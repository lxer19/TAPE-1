Abstract: Our previous work introduced a methodology for synthesizing and analyzing basic behaviors which served as a substrate for generating a large repertoire of higher-level group interactions (Mataric 1992, Mataric 1993). In this paper we describe how, given the substrate, agents can learn to behave socially, i.e. to maximize average individual benefit by maximizing collective benefit. While this is a well-defined problem for rational agents, it is difficult to learn in situated domains. We describe three sources of reinforcement and show their necessity for learning non-greedy social rules. The learning strategy is demonstrated on a group of physical mobile robots learning to yield and share information in a foraging task.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, only a few classes of group sizes and prototypical relations among agents are relevant for any given type of interaction. The canonical form of social relation is the dominance hierarchy or pecking order, ubiquitous in animal societies, from hermit crabs and chickens to primates and people <ref> (Chase 1982, Chase & Rohwer 1987) </ref>. Besides mating, the majority of animal social interaction focuses on establishing and maintaining pecking orders (Cheney & Seyfarth 1990). Although no directly derivable evolutionary benefit has been proven, hierarchies certainly serve to ritualize and thus simplify social interactions.

Reference-contexts: Social facilitation refers to the process of selectively expressing a behavior which is already a part of the animal's species-specific repertoire. Birds pecking at milk bottle caps in order to drink the milk inside <ref> (Davis 1973, McFarland 1985) </ref>, and eating more in groups then when alone (McFarland 1987) are both examples of social facilitation in which the animals are not learning any new behavior but only responding to a releaser (Davis 1973). <p> Birds pecking at milk bottle caps in order to drink the milk inside (Davis 1973, McFarland 1985), and eating more in groups then when alone (McFarland 1987) are both examples of social facilitation in which the animals are not learning any new behavior but only responding to a releaser <ref> (Davis 1973) </ref>.

Vicarious punishment and vicarious reward are both effective, although less so then their direct counterparts. In a sense, vicarious learning is a means of distributing trials over multiple agents so that one agent need not perform then all.

Reference-contexts: Functionally different agents can create lasting interference over conflicting goals. An agent can undo the work of another not out of immediate need for the resources but due to some higher-level goal such as, for instance, establishing dominance. Goal competition is studied primarily by the Distributed AI community <ref> (Gasser & Huhns 1989) </ref>. The approaches usually involve predicting other agents' goals and intentions, thus requiring agents to maintain models of each other's internal state (e.g. Huber & Durfee (1993), Miceli & Cesta (1993)). Such prediction abilities require computational resources that do not scale well with increased group sizes.

Reference-contexts: The relevance of conspecifics' behavior is recognized in biology by the innate propensity for social learning. For instance, young animals copy the behavior of an adult automatically, often without any direct reward <ref> (Gould 1982) </ref>. Furthermore, behavior of peers is also copied, especially if it leads to a reward. This type of social behavior results in the development of culture in the form of behavior patterns that are passed on through generations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Our previous work focused on analyzing and synthesizing complex group behaviors from simple social interactions between individuals <ref> (Mataric 1992, Mataric 1993) </ref>. We introduced a methodology which involved designing a collection of basic behaviors which served as a substrate for a large repertoire of higher-level interactions. In this paper we describe how agents can extend the basic repertoire in order to learn to behave socially. <p> Sharing information consists of learning when to broadcast position information when when to receive and store it. The social rules are expressed within the robots' natural habitat and the context of their usual routines, in this case foraging. The foraging context was chosen because our previous work <ref> (Mataric 1992, Mataric 1993) </ref> provided the basic behavior repertoire to which social rules could easily be added. The built-in foraging behavior consists of a finite state controller which, in response to mutually-exclusive conditions consisting of internal state, activates appropriate basic behaviors from the robots' repertoire.

Reference-contexts: Also called observational learning, social learning is ubiquitous in nature <ref> (McFarland 1985, McFarland 1987) </ref> and the propensity for it appears to be innate. Animals imprint, mimic, and imitate adults of their own kind instinctively, often without obtaining direct rewards or even successfully achieving the goal of the behavior (Mc-Farland 1985, Gould 1982). <p> This type of social behavior results in the development of culture in the form of behavior patterns that are passed on through generations. In a well known example, monkeys repeatedly discovered washing potatoes and separating dirt from seeds <ref> (McFarland 1985) </ref>. Observed behavior of conspecifics can serve as negative as well as positive reinforcement. For example, animals quickly learn not to eat food that has had a poisonous effect on others, or to avoid people if others have been hunted by them (Davis 1973, Gould 1982, McFarland 1987). <p> However, the difficult of certain learning problems, such as particularly altruistic social rules, indicates that those are best learned genetically. Data from biology seems to support this intuition, since animals do not appear to learn altruism toward their kin but instead are endowed with it <ref> (McFarland 1985) </ref>. All of the presented results are preliminary, and are only a glimpse at the wide variety of social rules that can be learned, and forms of social reinforcement that are worth exploring.

Imitation of conspecifics is easier than general imitation and mimicry, but animals, and some birds (Moore 1992), are capable of both.

Social learning includes learning how to perform a behavior, through imitation, and when to perform it, through social facilitation. Imitation is defined as the ability to observe and repeat the behavior of another animal or agent.

Given that most environments are not of this kind, this algorithm is bound to work faster. It has been successfully used to acquire the basic, greedy strategy for individual foraging (Mataric 1994).

Social facilitation refers to the process of selectively expressing a behavior which is already a part of the animal's species-specific repertoire.
