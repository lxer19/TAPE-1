Reference-contexts: The IR problem can be phrased as the maximum independent set problem for the conflict graph. While the maximum independent set problem in arbitrary graphs is well known to be notoriously hard to approximate <ref> [ALM + 92] </ref>, we use the structure of the graphs arising from our problem to provide good approximation algorithms. Define a d-claw as the graph K 1;d , i.e., a star with d leaves. A graph is d-clawfree if has no induced d-claw.

Reference-contexts: Thus our results provide a tight analysis of the local heuristic for the weighted independent set problem in these classes of graphs. Note that there has also been work on obtaining better ratios for the unweighted independent set problem in bounded degree graphs <ref> [BF94] </ref>. In Section 2, we describe in more detail how the IR problem arises in the application to molecular biology. In Section 3, we present the NP-hardness proof of Theorem 1. In Section 4, we sketch the basic local improvement algorithm for the unweighted (uniform) case. <p> Finally, local improvement algorithms have recently been studied extensively, and some interesting positive results have been obtained for related problems, such as independent sets and vertex covers in degree bounded graphs, 3-DM matching, k-set-packing etc. <ref> [BF94, Hal95] </ref>. Halldorsson [Hal95] shows reducibilities between these problems and uses these reductions to analyze local improvement heuristics for the unweighted case. We hope that the ideas in our analysis can be extended to analyzing heuristics for the weighted versions of these problems. <p> This is particularly interesting for the case of independent sets in bounded degree graphs, where a slightly better local improvement can be applied to improve performance in the unweighted case <ref> [BF94] </ref>, but nothing is known about the weighted version. Acknowledgement We would like to thank Dan Gusfield for explaining the biological motivation for the problem and Steve Skiena for useful discussions regarding the NP-completeness of the problem.

Reference-contexts: We present below a simple construction that shows that the performance ratio of d 2 is the best possible for the local improvement heuristic. To this end, we use the following result of Erdos and Sachs, which can be found in <ref> [Bol78] </ref>. Lemma 3 Given positive integers d and g, for all n sufficiently large, there exist d-regular graphs on 2n vertices with girth at least g.

Reference-contexts: Such alignments tend to reflect similar regions between the two strings that have remained conserved over the evolutionary process of point mutations that has led to the divergence between the two sequences. - 3 - Recent studies on genome rearrangements <ref> [BP93, BP95, HP95, KS93, KS94, KR95] </ref> have addressed the notion of distances between sequences under more large-scale mutational operations. An example is a "reversal" that works on a large contiguous block of a genomic sequence and reverses the order of certain "markers" in the fragment.

Reference-contexts: First, we present a technical lemma describing the existence of bipartite graphs with an expansion property. Its proof is implicit in proofs for existence of expander graphs (see for example, Chung <ref> [Chu78] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This results in a net increase in the size of I. The local improvement algorithm performs such t-improvements as long as they are available. It is not hard to argue that this algorithm runs in polynomial time for any fixed t. Halldorsson <ref> [Hal95] </ref> has shown that the t-opt heuristic when applied to a d + 1-clawfree graph achieves a performance ratio of d 2 + * for any fixed * &gt; 0 and in fact * decreases exponentially in t. <p> Note that this algorithm runs in polynomial time if the weights are uniform or if they are polynomial functions of n. Let us assume for the moment that all rectangles have the same weight. By Theorem 1, the problem remains N P -hard.

Reference-contexts: Another macro-mutational operation is a transposition that transfers a block of sequence to another position. These rearrangements have been postulated and confirmed to occur in the evolutionary history between several existing species <ref> [HCKP94] </ref>. The body of work mentioned above addresses the computation of a minimal set of such rearrangement operations to transform an initial sequence A to a final sequence B.

A global alignment arranges the two strings with spaces inserted within them, so that the characters are organized in columns and most columns contain identical or similar characters in both strings.

A global alignment arranges the two strings with spaces inserted within them, so that the characters are organized in columns and most columns contain identical or similar characters in both strings. <p> The problem of selecting fragments of high local similarity between two strings can be tackled by applying one of several known methods for local alignment <ref> [SW81] </ref> in the literature. The output of such a method is a set of pairs of substrings from A and B that have high local similarity. However, the projection of these pairs in the two strings may not be disjoint as required.
