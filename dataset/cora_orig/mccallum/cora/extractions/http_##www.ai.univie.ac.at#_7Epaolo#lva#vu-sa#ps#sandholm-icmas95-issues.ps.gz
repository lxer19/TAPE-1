Title: Issues in Automated Negotiation and Electronic Commerce: Extending the Contract Net Framework  
Author: Tuomas Sandholm and Victor Lesser 
Address: Amherst, MA 01003  
Affiliation: University of Massachusetts at Amherst Computer Science Department  
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a number of previously unaddressed issues that arise in automated negotiation among self-interested agents whose rationality is bounded by computational complexity. These issues are presented in the context of iterative task allocation negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such choices through conditional commitment breaking penalties is presented. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques for linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts are presented as methods for escaping local optima in the task allocation process. Implementing both methods among self-interested bounded rational agents is discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion among self-interested agents is described, and alternative remedies are presented.

Reference-contexts: In cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS), commitments are often allowed to be broken unilaterally based on some local reasoning that attempts to incorporate the perspective of common good <ref> [ Decker and Lesser, 1995 ] </ref> . A more general alternative is to use protocols with continuous levels of commitment based on a monetary penalty method, where commitments vary from unbreakable to breakable as a continuum by assigning a commitment breaking cost to each commitment separately.

Reference-contexts: An option corresponds to an item in the power set of offers that an agent can accept or make. * By waiting an agent may miss opportunities due to oth ers making related contracts first. An agent should anticipate future negotiation and domain events in its strategy <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1995b ] </ref> . 10 It suffices to take these events into account in marginal cost estimation: this will cause the agent to anticipate with its domain solution. <p> Linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts were presented as methods to avoid local optima in the global task allocation space, and their implementation among BRSI agents was discussed.

Reference-contexts: A first step towards extending the CNP to deal with these issues was the work on TRA-CONET <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> . It provided a formal model for bounded rational (BR) self-interested agents to make announcing, bidding and awarding decisions.

Focused addressing means that in highly constrained situations, agents with free resources announce availability, while in less constrained situations, agents with tasks announce tasks. <p> Attempts to solve these problems include focused addressing [ Smith, 1980 ] , audience restrictions [ Van Dyke Parunak, 1987; Sandholm, 1993 ] and ignoring incoming messages that are sufficiently outdated <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> . Focused addressing means that in highly constrained situations, agents with free resources announce availability, while in less constrained situations, agents with tasks announce tasks. This avoids announcing too many tasks in highly constrained situations, where these announcements would seldom lead to results.

Reference-contexts: Multiagent contracts through mutual contracts. A multiagent contract is equivalent to a sequence of mutual contracts. In cases where a local optimum with respect to mutual contracts has been reached, 11 Sathi et al. <ref> [ Sathi and Fox, 1989 ] </ref> did this by having a centralized mediator cluster several announcements and bids from multiple agents into atomic contracts. That is unreasonable if decentralization is desired. the first mutual contracts in the sequence will incur losses.

Reference-contexts: These problems are exacerbated by the uncertainty of an open environment in which new agents and new tasks arrive thus previous decisions may be suboptimal in light of new information. The original contract net protocol (CNP) <ref> [ Smith, 1980 ] </ref> did not explicitly deal with these issues, which we think must be taken into account if agents are to operate effectively in a wide range of automated negotiation domains. <p> For example, the focused addressing scheme of the CNP was implemented so that in low utilization situations, contractors announced tasks, but in high utilization mode, potential contractees signaled availability| i.e. bid without receiving announcements first <ref> [ Smith, 1980; Van Dyke Parunak, 1987 ] </ref> . So, the choice of a protocol was based on characteristics of the environment. Alternatively, the choice can be made for each negotiation separately before that negotiation begins. <p> when estimating the probabilities of receiving certain tasks, because the very offering or accepting of a certain task may directly affect the likelihood of getting offers or acceptances for other tasks. 6 Message congestion: Tragedy of the commons Most distributed implementations of automated contracting have run into message congestion problems <ref> [ Smith, 1980; Van Dyke Parunak, 1987; Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> .
