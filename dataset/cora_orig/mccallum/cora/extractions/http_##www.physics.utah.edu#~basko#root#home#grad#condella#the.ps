Reference-contexts: QCD attempts to provide an explanation for the binding of quarks and gluons into hadrons and the strong interactions between hadrons. QCD is a quantum gauge field theory whose formulation came about by exploring extensions of quantum electrodynamics (QED) <ref> [1] </ref>. On the lowest level, QCD describes the interactions of quarks and gluons. The quarks, ( up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), and top (t)), and their antiparticles, (u, d, s, c, b, t), are fermions of fractional electric charge and color charge. <p> changing loops in each direction. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 0.005 0.015 0.025 0.035 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 m 26 0.0002 0.0004 0.0006 0.0008 0.001 0.0012 hfi 0 As with any Metropolis algorithm the moves are accepted if the local action, S, is decreased or if a random number on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is less than e S .

Reference-contexts: To overcome this inability, a numerical technique was proposed for looking at QCD non-pertubatively. To use numerical techniques, however, one must discretize the theory in such a way to ensure that the theory is recovered in the continuum limit. In 1974, Wilson <ref> [4] </ref>, hoping to explain confinement, formulated a lattice method now called lattice QCD (LQCD). LQCD has now become the basis for most non-pertubative studies of QCD.

Reference-contexts: Looking at the opposite, zero mass limit of QCD gives more insight. If one assumes the quarks are massless, the theory possesses a "chiral symmetry". Recent numerical studies support the following scenario, depending on the number of flavors of massless quarks N f <ref> [20] </ref>: For N f = 2 the phase transition is second order. For N f 3 the transition is first order. The temperature at which these transitions occur is roughly T c = 150 MeV [21] In nature, quark masses lie between these limits of the model. <p> Simulations with N f = 2 light degenerate quarks show a probable second order phase transition [22].

Reference-contexts: The Gross-Neveu model is one such candidate. It seems to have chiral behavior similar to QCD but does not confine and its fermion determinant is real for nonzero chemical potential <ref> [30] </ref>. Another method would be to formulate a model that maintains important thermodynamical confining aspects of QCD and whose action does not become complex upon introducing a chemical potential. The fluxtube model proposed by Patel [31] in 1984 seems to be ideal for this purpose.

The fluxtube model proposed by Patel <ref> [31] </ref> in 1984 seems to be ideal for this purpose. The model can be simply stated. One can picture QCD as an interacting theory of quarks, antiquarks, and flux tubes. At any location one can place a maximum of three quarks or anti-quarks in a tightly confined space.

Reference-contexts: At this point one has enough information to design a Monte Carlo simulation of the model and begin to investigate its thermodynamic properties. The model without a chemical potential has also been studied before by the MILC collaboration <ref> [32] </ref>. The MILC collaboration used a restricted flux tube model, restricted in the sense that only single quarks and anti-quarks could occupy a given site, to give a quantitative perspective of what might be occurring near the deconfining phase transition of QCD.

Reference-contexts: For h = h 0 = 0 the fi at which the above partition function undergoes a first-order phase transition has been accurately determined [33, 34]. DeGrand and DeTar <ref> [35] </ref> showed in mean field theory that the first-order phase transition persists for small magnetic fields but at higher fields there is apparently no phase transition. <p> The specific heat scales as C l ff=-Q tl - ; (3.27) where l is the characteristic dimensionless size of the system. 3.3 Simulation From simulations we know the three state, three dimensional Potts model un dergoes a first-order phase transition for h &lt; ~ 0:001 <ref> [35] </ref>. The phase transition for the Z (3) model at h = 0 is known to occur at fi 0 cr 1 = :36703 0:000014 [33]. We chose to run at two chemical potentials over a range of temperatures and with one mass/flux ratio. <p> Our purpose was first to test the method by verifying the existence of a phase transition at zero chemical potential and, second, to investigate the thermodynamics at a large , where past mean field calculations <ref> [35] </ref> found no phase transition, to see if the phase transition persisted. The parameter mapping between the flux tube model and the Potts model is nonlinear, making the choice of parameters for the flux tube model difficult. <p> Fig. 3.3 shows h 0 as the chemical potential is increased. We chose to simulate at = 1:75. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 show how the Potts model parameters change with beta at = 1:75. If the mean field predictions in <ref> [35] </ref> are accurate then the phase transition should disappear. To simulate the fluxtube model, I wrote a metropolis method based algorithm and executed it in the C programming language. The allowed moves can be seen in figure 3.6. <p> The accuracy of the fits is not as good as many Potts model simulations but are consistent with a first order phase transition. On the contrary, as expected from the mean field analysis done by DeGrand and DeTar <ref> [35] </ref>, the = 1:75 data shows none of the signals of a first order phase transition. No clear two state signals were obtained in any of the data sets. Also, the specific heat shows no growth with the size of the lattice.

Reference-contexts: This property is known as scaling and helps to provide a framework of understanding continuous transitions. Continuous transitions also feature a diverging correlation length at the transition. For a complete treatment of critical phenomena see Stanley <ref> [36] </ref>. 3.2.1 Phase transitions on a finite systems In Monte Carlo simulations one calculates the average, constructs histograms and time histories of observables over the generated configurations. From this information one may test whether there is evidence for a first order or Continuous phase transition.

Reference-contexts: To obtain accurate errors on the measurements one has to be careful. Because of autocorrelation between successive data points it would be misleading to treat the individual measurements as being statistically independent. To account for large autocorrelation times a blocks-of-blocks bootstrapping technique <ref> [40] </ref> was used to assess the errors involved. The technique calculates the error by building sample data sets from the original data set. The sample data sets are built by sampling blocks of size k from the original series.

Reference-contexts: Comparing the square of the slope for the width with that of the slope for the peaks as suggested by Borgs et al gives satisfactory results ( within 2 ). Another common analysis of Monte Carlo runs stems from the work of Ferren-berg and Swendson <ref> [41, 42] </ref>. Ferrenberg and Swendson show how one can utilize multiple runs to interpolate data between different fi.

Reference-contexts: His "H" dibaryon has been of interest to particle physicists ever since. Following Jaffe's bag-model inspired conjecture, many have given mass estimates of the H. Jaffe used the quadratic Casimir operator of SU (6) to predict the mass of the H. Following the methods of the bag model <ref> [43] </ref>, Jaffe used the result that for S-wave hadrons the lowest-order gluon exchange lowered the mass of the hadron by a factor i&gt;j ~ i ~ j M (m i R; m j R) (4.1) where ~ i and ~ i are the spin and color vector of the ith quark,

Reference-contexts: Kodama et al used QCD sum rule techniques and found that the H should be bound by 40M eV . Previous lattice calculations have been performed by two different groups. Mackenzie and Thacker <ref> [44] </ref> performed a measurement of the H mass on a small lattice and concluded that the H was probably not bound. However, Iwasaki et al [45], did a similar calculation and found just the opposite: the H should be stable under strong decay.
