Abstract: We present a study of the CMS level-1 jet trigger comparing the baseline nonoverlapping 4 fi 4 trigger tower region algorithm with single tower and overlapping 8 fi 8 trigger tower region algorithms. The results indicate that the baseline algorithm has the best performance for the physics signals studied.

Reference-contexts: In this note we study the single and multiple jet triggers which are required with a well defined efficiency in order to reconstruct jet spectra that overlap with data attainable at lower energy colliders such as the Tevatron. Our initial studies <ref> [1] </ref> of the jet trigger indicated that a non-overlapping 4 fi 4 trigger tower region sum provided good jet trigger, although an algorithm with overlapping 8 fi 8 trigger tower regions seemed to perform somewhat better. These algorithms are described in detail below. <p> both directions to span the complete calorimeter. because of its importance in the study of high P t physics, leaving only about 3 kHz for the jet triggers. 4 Jet Trigger Data and Algorithms 4.1 Input Data The mapping of physical calorimeter towers into trigger towers is discussed in references <ref> [1] </ref>. There is a 1:1 correspondence between the HCAL and ECAL trigger towers. Typically a 6 fi 6 crystal array is summed to make an ECAL trigger tower. The trigger tower size is equivalent to the HCAL physical towers, :0873 fi :0873 in fi in the baseline design [2, 3]. <p> The logic needed for purging spurious multiple jet triggers is rather sophisticated and would require development of an ASIC. 5 Simulation Program We used a fast simulation program <ref> [1] </ref> to evaluate the performance of the jet trigger. This program used the PYTHIA/JETSET 7.4 Monte Carlo to simulate several hundred thousand QCD jet and minimum bias events. The response of the CMS detector was simulated for these events using a simplified geometry with a parameterized detector response. <p> The appropriate number of calorimeter ECAL crystal HCAL tower energies were added to obtain the ECAL and HCAL trigger tower data. Both ECAL and HCAL trigger tower data were further reduced in resolution and dynamic range to account for the 8 bit quadlinear scale input <ref> [1] </ref>. 6 Jet reconstruction The determination of the jet trigger efficiency required the definition of a jet. Association of particles to initial partons is not established uniquely in the LUND jet fragmentation model.

The trigger tower size is equivalent to the HCAL physical towers, :0873 fi :0873 in fi in the baseline design <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. The size remains constant in and the size remains constant in out to an of 2.1, 2 beyond which the size doubles. There are 3888 total ECAL and 3888 total HCAL trigger towers from = -2.6 to = 2.6 (54 x 72 divisions). <p> The size remains constant in and the size remains constant in out to an of 2.1, 2 beyond which the size doubles. There are 3888 total ECAL and 3888 total HCAL trigger towers from = -2.6 to = 2.6 (54 x 72 divisions). The calorimeter level-1 trigger system <ref> [2] </ref> will receive digital trigger tower transverse energies on an eight bit compressed scale. Programmable memory lookup tables will enable full flexibility to modify the compression algorithm as required. <p> The trigger system adder tree uses transverse energies in a linear scale with a 10 bit dynamic range, decoded from the 8-bit compressed scale data, to form trigger sums for jet, missing E t and sum E t triggers. In the baseline design, three adder ASICs <ref> [2] </ref>, which are capable of adding 8 signed 10-bit numbers at 160 MHz while keeping track of tower and arithmetic overflows, are used to sum the data from ECAL and HCAL in to two 4 fi 4 regions every crossing, i.e., 25 ns. <p> The first algorithm, which forms our baseline <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, uses sums of ECAL and HCAL transverse energies in non-overlapping 4 fi 4 trigger towers spanning a square region of dimension 0:348 in space. This jet region size is substantially smaller than the dimensions used in the current jet analysis at the Tevatron.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the fixed regions cause substantial leakage of energy across the boundaries of non-centered jets. However, this particular algorithm has special benefits because forming 4 fi 4 sums is also needed for the missing energy <ref> [4] </ref> and tau triggers, and, providing calorimeter isolation for the muon trigger. The second jet algorithm is based on a cut on transverse energy sum of corresponding individual ECAL and HCAL trigger towers. <p> This table illustrates that the jet triggers based on 4 fi 4 algorithm have comparable performance to the missing E t trigger. Such redundancy at the trigger level is particularly important because of the poor resolution of missing E t trigger and its uncertain simulation <ref> [4] </ref>. The primary reason to consider the single tower trigger is to provide a dedicated tau trigger at level-1.
