Reference-contexts: These latter results are also consequences of our characterization. Balanced graphs first arose in the study of random graphs. See <ref> [1] </ref>. More recently, there have been several papers written on balanced extensions of graphs. Among these is [4], which gives references to several more papers on this topic. In [5], a result is proved which implies that maximal planar graphs and maximal outerplanar graphs are balanced.

Reference-contexts: Details of these theorems and their relationship to the max-flow/min-cut theorem can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The intent of this article is to add another area which can be profitably studied from this point of view: balanced graphs. Throughout this paper, graphs are assumed to be finite without loops or multiple edges. <p> Theorem 1 Let G be a graph. Then G is balanced if and only if I (G) has a normalized edge weight assignment. Proof: We adopt the network terminology used in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we prove a good characterization of balanced graphs. The proof shows that deciding whether a given graph G is balanced is equivalent to finding a minimum cut in a certain network related to G. The main idea of this proof first appeared in <ref> [3] </ref>, which gives an efficient algorithm for the more general problem of finding a subgraph H of a given graph G such that d (H) is maximum. However, our characterization of balanced graphs appears to be new. <p> However, there are examples of graphs G where the algorithm produces a subgraph H with d (H) &gt; d (G), but d (H) is not maximum. For a version of this algorithm which does find a subgraph of maximum density in polynomial time, see <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Applications In this section we apply Theorem 1 to prove some results on how balanced graphs may be combined to form a larger balanced graph.

In <ref> [5] </ref>, a result is proved which implies that maximal planar graphs and maximal outerplanar graphs are balanced. After deriving ad hoc proofs that edge-transitive graphs and complete m-partite graphs are balanced, the present author began to suspect that a common proof was possible.
