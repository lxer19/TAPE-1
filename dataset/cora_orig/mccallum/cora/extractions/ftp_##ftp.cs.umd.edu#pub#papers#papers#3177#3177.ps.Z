Abstract: Traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection algorithms produce a lot of false targets when applied to single-look, high-resolution, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, due to the presence of speckle. We propose a two stage CFAR detector followed by conditional dilation for detecting point and extended targets in polarimetric SAR images. In the first stage, possible targets are detected and false targets due to the speckle are removed by using global statistical parameters. In the second stage, the local statistical parameters are used to detect targets in regions adjacent to targets detected in the first stage. Conditional dilation is then performed to Good experimental results are obtained when our method is applied to single-look, high recover target pixels lost in second stage CFAR detection.

Reference-contexts: In single channel SAR images, backscattering amplitude is used for target detection and it is usually assumed that strong backscattering comes from targets. A target will be lost when the backscattering amplitude from the target is not large enough compared with the background at some aspect angles <ref> [1] </ref>. To overcome this, fully polarimetric SAR images are used. The value at every pixel of a polarimetric SAR image is a four-element complex vector.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the distance for samples from the background is smaller than the distance for samples from the targets. The distance is also the output of a polarimetric whitening 1 filter. The properties of the filter are discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, it is used as a criterion to recognize targets that are of much stronger reflectance than the background. When d c (X) is greater than a threshold T , the sample X is considered as a target pixel.

Reference-contexts: When d c (X) is greater than a threshold T , the sample X is considered as a target pixel. The key problem is the choice of the threshold T . Ulaby <ref> [4] </ref> statistically models the background, which is usually called clutter in the radar literature. The distance d c (X) is also statistically modeled.

Reference-contexts: Since the background is not uniform and the backscattering amplitude from the background fluctuates, a CFAR detector is adopted. For a given pixel, called the pixel under test (PUT), its neighboring pixels, called the reference pixels, are used to calculate test statistics <ref> [5] </ref> or to estimate the parameters in the probability density function (PDF) [6]. The threshold for a fixed false alarm rate is obtained from the statistical model.

Traditional CFAR algorithms are used for point targets and are applied to multi-look SAR images in order to reduce the effects of speckle noise [5, 6, 7, 8]. They are not suited for single-look, high-resolution SAR images. For the purpose of recognition, we emphasize the single-look case because multi-look SAR images are usually obtained by reducing spatial resolution and a portion of the information is lost. <p> The two stage CFAR detector and conditional dilation algorithms are described in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to detect stationary man-made objects on land, so we use the Weibull distribution. In this paper, the CFAR detector is based on the distance d c (X). In order to show the validity of the Weibull distribution for the distance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test <ref> [9] </ref> is used as a goodness-of-fit test. Assume that y 0 ; : : :; y n1 are n independent samples from the same distribution and that the cumulative distribution function is F (Y ). Let F n (Y ) be the sampled cumulative distribution func 3 tion. <p> Given the parameters C and B and the independent samples, a confidence test on the Weibull distribution can be set up according to Table 1 and (8) and (9). When CFAR is implemented, it is required that the samples be independent. The sample correlation coefficient <ref> [9] </ref> is used. The smaller the sample correlation coefficient is, the less correlated the data are. Although decorrelation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for independence, it is commonly used due to the simplicity of computing correlation coefficients. <p> When the global CFAR detector is used, spatial correlation must be considered before doing the goodness-of-fit test and obtaining the threshold. A straightforward way to decorrelate the data is to divide the image into small windows, to compute the correlation coefficients between any two of these windows <ref> [9] </ref>, and to select windows whose correlation coefficients with each other are small. However, this method is impractical. For a 1024 fi 256 image, 1023! correlation coefficients would need to be computed if the size of the small windows is 16 fi 16.

Although decorrelation is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for independence, it is commonly used due to the simplicity of computing correlation coefficients. Since the data a This table is from <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 in this paper are from non-Gaussian distributions, it is difficult to set a confidence level for the decorrelation test. Therefore, decorrelation of the data is performed only when the data fail to pass the goodness-of-fit test regardless of the values of the correlation coefficients.
