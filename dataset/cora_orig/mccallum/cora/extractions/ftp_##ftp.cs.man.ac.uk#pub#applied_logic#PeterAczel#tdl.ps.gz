Title: Term Declaration Logic and Generalised Composita

Abstract: This paper gives a generalisation of a version of order sorted logic and an abstract axiomatic setting for the treatment of substitution. The two ideas are shown to be related, an equational specification of term declaration logic being a presentation of a finitary generalised compositum. The axiomatic approach to substitution is compared with some others.

Reference-contexts: The original motivation for our interest in these ideas has been in connection with a long term program to develope a theory of structured objects, intended to be used as a tool in the development of a mathematical situation theory, See <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. Structured objects are like terms in that they may contain things called parameters and there is a notion of substitution for parameters.

Reference-contexts: Structured objects are like terms in that they may contain things called parameters and there is a notion of substitution for parameters. A good example of the kind of structured object that was our starting point may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>, where a universe of possibly non-well-founded sets built out of atoms is used. Sets can be substituted for the atoms. So here the atoms are playing the role of the parameters or variables.

Reference-contexts: The indexing sets are allowed to vary in the axioms of a specification and the inference rules need to be reformulated so as to allow the index sets to change in a deduction. See <ref> [4] </ref>, [6]. We prefer to live with the simpler kind of logic which keeps to unindexed equations. There is no problem with the completeness of the logic provided of course, as here, the semantics is made to match the inference rules.

Reference-contexts: The notion of a finitary algebraic theory is a category theoretic notion formulated first by Lawvere. A particularly useful account may be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Some more work will be needed before it can be fully determined whether finitary generalised composita can be used to capture, at the right level of abstraction, the notion of a TDL algebraic theory. We conjecture that it can.

By using term declarations these auxiliary sorts have been avoided. Nevertheless they have a representation as the sort terms estack and push (nat, stack) respectively. It is not clear yet how term formation declarations might be used in specifications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The aim of this paper is to introduce and relate two ideas. The first one is that of Term Declaration Logic (TDL). This is a mild generalisation of the order sorted logic with term declarations of <ref> [8] </ref>. The second idea is that of a generalised compositum. This notion generalises a notion first introduced by Nerode in [7]. It also gives generalisations of the notions of an instantiation system of [10] and a unification algebra of [9].

Reference-contexts: The second idea is that of a generalised compositum. This notion generalises a notion first introduced by Nerode in [7].

The two ideas are related in the following way.

The two ideas are related in the following way. <p> Although we were aware of the tie up of our infinitary examples with the more familiar finitary examples from ordinary syntax, we did not pursue these connections until we saw the report <ref> [10] </ref> and the notion of an instantiation system. <p> A) Then E 0 E and all the equations of E can be de duced from the equations in E 0 . 3.4 Finitary gcs and instantiation systems We show that the notion of a finitary gc more or less captures the same idea as that of an instantiation system, <ref> [10] </ref>. Given a finitary gc (A; X; S) let S 0 be the set of maps sjY such that s 2 S and Y is a finite subset of fx 2 Xjsx 6= xg. <p> Then we have the following result. Theorem 3.9 The correspondence (A; X; S) 7! (A; X; S 0 ; fl); described above, gives a one-one correspondence between finitary, !-replete gcs and instantiation sys tems. 4 Finitary !-replete composita and al gebraic theories Williams has observed in <ref> [10] </ref> that his untyped instan-tiation systems are in one-one correspondence, up to isomorphism, both with algebraic theories (as defined by Lawvere) and also with finitary !-replete com-posita. We review some aspects of this here. We also review the relationship between algebraic theories and standard equational logic.
