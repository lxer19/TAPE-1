Title: Distributed, Dynamic Control of Circuit-Switched Banyan Networks  
Author: C. Salisbury and R. Melhem 
Address: Pittsburgh  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: Circuit-switched Banyan interconnection networks can be built from simple switching elements that do not have logical processing or buffering capabilities. This paper describes a distributed technique for dynamic control of such a network, so that circuits can be established in response to the changing needs of a parallel application. Control information is interleaved with data, thus avoiding the need for a separate network to process control messages. These techniques are particularly useful in optical networks, where it may be desirable to provide all-optical circuit-switched connections.

Reference-contexts: Distributed approaches spread control functions across several devices, increasing fault tolerance and performance while also potentially increasing complexity. The distributed approach described in [5] uses a separate control network and control logic placed in each switch. A distributed approach for controlling an optical passive star network is described in <ref> [1] </ref>. This paper describes distributed, dynamic control of circuit-switched banyan networks comprised of simple switches, without the need for a control network. Multiplexing is used to share the network bandwidth for both control and data communication.

Reference-contexts: A global clock is required to synchronize all switches. Techniques have been developed for dynamic control of circuit-switched networks. One approach is to use a central network controller to accept communication requests, determine the required network state, and notify the requester when the state is available <ref> [2] </ref>. Distributed approaches spread control functions across several devices, increasing fault tolerance and performance while also potentially increasing complexity. The distributed approach described in [5] uses a separate control network and control logic placed in each switch.

Reference-contexts: Allocating network bandwidth. To allow the control communication pattern to be implemented without blocking the network must be partitionable into contention-free and channel-balanced disjoint k-ary cubes, as described in <ref> [3] </ref>. The processors that must communicate in each step of the distributed procedure form a k-ary 1-cube. From [3], a cube banyan network (and by symmetry, the reverse cube network of Figure 1) has the required property. <p> Allocating network bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: A banyan network interconnecting N = k n processors is built with n stages of N=k switches, where each switch is a cross-bar switch of size k fi k. The distributed algorithm for creating network states is based on a commonly used banyan network structure called a Bi-Delta network <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.1. Self-routing in banyan networks. Banyan networks are distinguished by the interconnection pattern between the network stages. For example, the network shown in Figure 1 is called the "reverse cube" network for N = 8 and k = 2. <p> Delta networks are a class of banyan network with the property that the path descriptor for a destination node is a permutation of the n radix-k digits of the node address <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. This property is known as self-routing. This means that the output port used at a switch does not depend on the address of the node originating the message. The self-routing property allows each switch to be labeled with a single descriptor for the path used to reach it.

Reference-contexts: TDM can improve performance when the time to cycle between network states is much less than the time to perform the control operation <ref> [6] </ref>. Each network state is provided for a time slot sufficient to transmit a message. The number of network states in the sequence is the multiplexing degree. A global clock is required to synchronize all switches. Techniques have been developed for dynamic control of circuit-switched networks.
