Abstract: There have been numerous attempts to provide a standardized definition of a computational agent, but little consensus has emerged. We propose a simple test for agenthood that can be applied to a putative computational agent. Roughly, this test seeks to capture the intuition that an agent is an entity that can function as part of a multiagent system. The test depends on the observed behavior of the supposed agent, and not on the internals of it. We apply the test to some well-known kinds of systems of (supposed) agents, and discuss the results. We present a formulation of the test and some variants with a semantics based on sociability. Our treatment of agenthood can thus serve as a methodological basis for evaluating putative agents and agent toolkits.

Reference-contexts: We support the intuition that interaction is crucial, and seek to incorporate it below in our treatment of agenthood. Tests. It is widely recognized that definitions can never be perfect <ref> [ Brachman, 1985 ] </ref> . This is because definitions are meant to provide necessary and sufficient conditions, but they usually provide neither because of exceptions. The concept of agents in general appears to be subjective and not crisp.

Reference-contexts: If it doesn't behave any differently, then X is not an agent. The agent test would pass the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) [ Lesser & Corkill, 1983 ] and distributed sensor net agents, pass the agents in WARREN <ref> [ Decker et al., 1997 ] </ref> , fail mail daemons, fail spreadsheets (and other software programs that just act on behalf of a user, which is a common definition for an agent), and fail simple Java applets. The test is independent of the mobility of the agents.

Reference-contexts: If another sensing agent is added to DVMT, the new agent would help in confirming or eliminating vehicle tracks proposed by the other agents, thus affecting their behavior, and most likely improving their performance. These are agents according to the Agent Test. The blackboard-based distributed HEARSAY-II <ref> [ Erman et al., 1980 ] </ref> is a system of agents for speech understanding. The agents are specialized, with some performing signal processing, while others are performing syntactic, semantic, or prosodic analyses. The agents concurrently process selected portions of an utterance, and then exchange hypotheses and results via a blackboard.

Reference-contexts: If another lexical or signal-processing agent is added to the system, it changes what gets put on or taken off the blackboard, and the other agents are affected. These also are agents. As a third example, utility-based agents for domains involving the delivery of goods <ref> [ Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> rely on negotiation mechanisms to determine their behavior. The negotiation mechanisms require direct interactions among the agents in a domain. Any additional agent of this kind would affect the negotiations. Hence, these agents would pass the Agent Test.

Reference-contexts: Closer to the present topic, computation was formalized through Turing machines, but this definition is being questioned by those who consider interaction a key aspect of computation that is not handled by the traditional definition <ref> [ Wegner, 1997 ] </ref> . We support the intuition that interaction is crucial, and seek to incorporate it below in our treatment of agenthood. Tests. It is widely recognized that definitions can never be perfect [ Brachman, 1985 ] . <p> Such claims can never be proved formally, because one key part is informal. However, they can be supported by anecdotal evidence. In Church's case, since every reasonable notion of computing (prior to interaction <ref> [ Wegner, 1997 ] </ref> ) was shown equivalent to Turing machines, that was evidence in favor of Turing machines being a good canonical view of computing. In our case, the anecdotal evidence is provided by relating concepts of agenthoodas realized in systems such as DVMT and othersto our formal definition.
