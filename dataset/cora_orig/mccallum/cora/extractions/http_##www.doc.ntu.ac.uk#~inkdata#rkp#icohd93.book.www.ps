Abstract: Dynamic (on-line) cursive script recognition works with data obtained from a digitising device which contains temporal information regarding the order of writing. In such a system the data is processed as entered, or immediately afterwards. Direct feedback can be provided to the user. Users of interactive dynamic recognition systems can adjust their writing style so as to obtain the best recognition results. They can write more legibly. However when a word is long the writing tends to deteriorate, making the recognition task more difficult. This paper describes two approaches to recognition: a strict method, requiring recognition of all the letters in a word, and a more tolerant method which recognizes only a part of the word and postulates the ending using a lexicon. The strict recognition employs a pattern recognizer operating at the input data level and uses a lexicon to remove character strings not allowable for the language concerned. Thus ambiguity is removed by the higher level lexical processor. The more tolerant recognizer uses the lexicon to provide possible character strings where use of the strict processing would fail to produce allowable words. The two methods are evaluated and the results reported for lexicons of various sizes. A combination of these methods aimed at increasing the recognition accuracy and obtaining a more tolerant system is described. The system described shows improvements in recognition for long words.

Reference-contexts: The postulation process searches the lexicon and returns words beginning with the given stem. The lexicon is organized into a directed acyclic graph data structure <ref> (APPEL and JACOBSON, 88) </ref> to optimize this process. As finding all possible word stems could be prohibitive, additional search constraints are used: - minimum and maximum number of letters to be postulated; - maximum number of words to postulate.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear what level of recognition accuracy researchers should be aiming for. Human handwriting is ambiguous, hence 100% accuracy based on pattern recognition alone is unlikely. The rate of letter recognition achieved by humans without the use of higher level information is reported by <ref> (EVETT et al., 93) </ref> at 79.6% on average for a sample of clear handwriting. This should be noted when evaluating a machine recognition system. Higher level knowledge, i.e. context, syntax and semantics, should be taken into consideration in order to achieve higher rates of recognition.

Reference-contexts: This is considered as the most important result. However, considering a number of word alternatives returned by the recognizer is useful for better understanding of the obtained results. Also, when higher level contextual processing is applied, it will use a number of word alternatives for each recognized word <ref> (KEENAN, 93) </ref>. Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 present obtained results. The results are averaged over different writers. Two-Way Analysis of Variance (LEWIS, 73) is performed on the recognition results in order to determine statistical significance of the recognition Table 1. Sizes of the lexicons used.

Reference-contexts: In order to achieve this aim, the input data points are filtered. The recognizer uses angular variation of the pen path. Hence, the important features are places of angular changes. A cross product filter <ref> (LIPSCOMB, 91) </ref> has been applied in order to eliminate points on long straight lines and preserve the points in the corners. The cross product filter requires a calibration, so it removes the right amount of detail. Height of the middle zone (H) of a word is used for that purpose.

Reference-contexts: The result of the process is the list of alternative words which the system was able to locate within the data, and their segmentations. The multiple interactive segmentation is comparable to cursive script recognition by elastic matching <ref> (TAPPERT, 82) </ref>, where the process of locating letters within the input data results in word segmentation. l i v u m e i c) e) a) a) initial data: little dots mark data points, bigger dots mark borders between clusters; b, c, d, e, f) some stages of the process: b, <p> Discussion The results obtained so far are encouraging. They were obtained using a number of lexicons, some of them relatively large (up to 15012 words) and also include writers totally unknown to the recognition system. The strict recognition approach used is comparable to that of other authors. Tappert <ref> (TAPPERT, 82) </ref> used elastic matching and bigram statistics. Results of average 97% correct for three writers were reported with writers creating their own letter prototypes. No tests were performed with writers unknown to the system.

Vinter (eds.), 1994 Word lookup <ref> (WELLS et al., 90) </ref> is performed for each recognized letter in order to limit the number of possible letter combinations considered. Only the allowable strings are processed further. This prunes the search where no allowable letter strings can be obtained (Figure 3b, c, d).

Reference-contexts: It also makes the matching less prone to mistakes. At the same time a large database of patterns may be necessary. While it is possible to encode every lower case letter of the Latin alphabet using no more than five direction vectors <ref> (WRIGHT, 88) </ref>, in practice handwritten letters are often found to be represented by longer sequences. In order to limit the variability of the direction vector sequences to be matched, they are reduced to at most five vectors. Particularly long sequences are reduced to six vectors. <p> The similarity measure is derived from the sum of absolute values of differences of lengths of respective direction vectors in patterns being matched. Relative vector lengths expressed in percent of the total pattern length are used, so that they can be compared together <ref> (WRIGHT, 88) </ref>. In order to improve the robustness of the matching process a multi-scale matching is performed. Figure 4 presents an example of the multi-scale matching applied to two letter shapes. A number of patterns are derived from the unknown one.
