Abstract: One approach to feature detection is to match a parametric model of the feature to the image data. Naturally, the performance of such detectors is highly dependent upon the function used to measure the degree of fit between the feature model and the image data. In this paper, we first show how an existing detector can be extended to use a weighted L 2 norm as the matching function with minimal extra computation. Next, we propose optimality criteria for the two fundamental aspects of feature detection performance: feature detection robustness and parameter estimation accuracy. We also show how to combine these criteria in various ways. We analyze the optimality criterion for parameter estimation under the approximating assumption that the feature manifold is locally linear. We also present a numerical algorithm that can be used to estimate the optimal weighting functions for the other optimality criteria. We include the results of applying this algorithm for step edge, line, and corner features.

Assuming the noise is independently distributed across the pixels, the optimal weighting function is: w (n; m) = Var [(n; m)] where Var [(n; m)] = E [ 2 (n; m)] E [(n; m)] 2 is the variance of the noise in pixel (n; m).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> we proposed a general purpose feature detection algorithm that uses the model matching approach developed by [ Hueckel, 1971 ] , [ Nalwa and Binford, 1986 ] , and [ Rohr, 1992 ] . <p> To measure the degree of similarity, a matching function is required. For simplicity, we used the Euclidean L 2 norm as the matching function in <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> . In this paper, we show how the matching function can be selected to maximize the performance of the detector. The selection of the matching function for a feature detector has never before been studied in a systematic manner. <p> N00014-95-1-0601. Several other agencies and companies have also supported aspects of this research. As with any other matching problem, there is a trade off between the complexity of the matching function and its performance. We begin this paper in Section 2 by showing how the feature detection algorithm of <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> can be extended to use an arbitrary weighted L 2 norm with essentially no extra computation. Hence, we can consider the class of weighted L 2 norms as possible matching functions, without sacrificing efficiency. <p> Therefore, in Section 4.2 we propose a numerical algorithm that can be used to find the optimal weighted L 2 norm for arbitrary features and any of our optimality criteria. In Section 4.3 we present the results of applying this algorithm for three of the features studied in <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> : the step edge, the corner, and the symmetric line. The results demonstrate the major contribution of this paper which is a method of automatically deriving optimal weighting functions for parametric feature detectors. <p> The results demonstrate the major contribution of this paper which is a method of automatically deriving optimal weighting functions for parametric feature detectors.

See <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> for more details. If N is the number of pixels in S; then each feature instance F (n; m; q) can be regarded as a vector in R N . <p> we actually base feature detection upon the square of the distance to the closest manifold point: min q kF (n; m; q) I (a + n; b + m)k 2 min X w (n; m) [F (n; m; q) I (a + n; b + m)] : The algorithm in <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> that is used to find the parameters q that actually minimize the expression in Equation (4) consists of three steps: 1 For Equation (3) to define an inner product, rather than a semi-inner product, we strictly require w (n; m) &gt; 0 for all (n; <p> When using a weighted L 2 norm, normalization is performed exactly as in Equation (6) except that the weighted inner product and weighted L 2 norm are used in place of their Euclidean equivalents. 2.4 Dimension Reduction In <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion [ Fukunaga, 1990 ] is applied as a dimension reduction technique.

Some of the optimality criteria require non-feature models as well as feature models. <p> The resulting optimal weighted L 2 norms improve the general purpose feature detector of <ref> [ Baker et al., 1998 ] </ref> with negligible computational cost.

Reference-contexts: Canny used a numerical algorithm to optimize his relatively simple optimality criterion for arbitrary 1-D features in <ref> [ Canny, 1986 ] </ref> . Here, I follow the same approach for arbitrary 2-D features. Since N is typically in the range 25100, to make the problem tractable I assume that the weighting function is rotationally symmetric. <p> The optimal weighting function for the parameter estimation accuracy of the sub-pixel localization of the step edge is presented in Figure 2 (a). The overall form of this optimal weighting function is as expected. Intuitively, the center-most pixels are the most important when estimating sub-pixel localization <ref> [ Canny, 1986 ] </ref> . The results in Figure 2 (c) for the combined parameter estimation accuracy of the corner are also in agreement with intuition.
