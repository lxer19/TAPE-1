Title: Computationally Tractable Probabilistic Modeling of Boolean Operators  
Abstract: The inference network model of information retrieval allows for a probabilistic interpretation of Boolean query operators. Prior work has shown, however, that these operators do not perform as well as the the pnorm operators developed in the context of the vector space model. The design of alternative operators in the inference network framework must contend with the issue of computational tractability. We define a flexible class of link matrices that are natural candidates for the implementation of Boolean operators and an O(n 2 ) algorithm for the computation of probabilities involving link matrices of this class. We present experimental results indicating that Boolean operators implemented in terms of link matrices from this class perform at least as well as pnorm operators.

Reference-contexts: It is our belief, and apparently that of others in the "probabilistic camp" (for example, see <ref> [Coo94] </ref> for an interesting exposition of the issues), that in the long run, models founded in probability theory will prove to be more fruitful in this regard. The results obtained here also suggest that some previous experimental results might merit a second look.

Reference-contexts: In [Tur90], a fourth type of matrix, the weighted-sum matrix is shown to be computable in linear time as well. This matrix does not satisfy the parent indifference criterion, but is shown in <ref> [Gre96] </ref> to satisfy a generalization of this criterion which contemplates a relative weighting of the importance of the parent nodes in determining the probability that the child node is true. <p> Now that all parent probabilities have been accounted for, this coefficient can be interpreted as the desired probability that the child is true. A formal proof of the correctness of the pic-eval algorithm can be found in <ref> [Gre96] </ref>. The pic-eval algorithm is executed in O (n 2 ) time. The initialization requires O (n) and the main loop is executed precisely P n P ni j=0 1 = O (n 2 ) times. Also, the constant factor is small. <p> These are the matrices that are piecewise linear when viewed as functions of the number of true parents. For families of matrices where all but one of the linear pieces of the function is of constant width, evaluation requires only O (n) time. The reader is referred to <ref> [Gre96] </ref> for details. 3 Experimentation In order to test the potential of the pic matrices as candidates for the implementation of Boolean query operators, a number of experiments were run with the inquery system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present a class of operators for the modeling of Boolean queries that is: * intuitively plausible, * probabilistically motivated, and * computationally tractable. For reasons to be explained, we have called these pic operators. In his doctoral dissertation <ref> [Tur90] </ref>, Howard Turtle developed a probabilistic model for information retrieval formulated in terms of a Bayesian inference network. An attractive aspect of the inference network approach is that it provides a direct, natural, computationally efficient, probabilistically motivated method for modeling Boolean query operators. <p> In the case of the inference network, a 2 fi 2 n matrix is needed since the range of each variable is ftrue; falseg. Boolean queries In <ref> [Tur90] </ref>, Turtle describes how the inference network can be used to model Boolean queries. Link matrices can be defined that are natural interpretations for the Boolean operators and can be evaluated very efficiently. They may be questioned on two counts, however. <p> Unfortunately, the evaluation of an arbitrary link matrix for an arbitrary set of input probabilities requires O (2 n ) floating point operations. In <ref> [Tur90] </ref>, Turtle shows that closed form expressions exist for some matrices, such that they may be evaluated in time linear in the number of parents, for arbitrary inputs. The matrices used for Boolean operators have that characteristic. <p> That is: pr (Q is true) = p 1 + p 2 + ::: + p n The matrices used for the and and or Boolean operators also meet the parent indifference criterion, as shown in figures 2b and 2c. In <ref> [Tur90] </ref>, a fourth type of matrix, the weighted-sum matrix is shown to be computable in linear time as well. <p> The four query sets had been created previously for other IR experiments run with the tipster [BCCC93] and inspec [RC19] data. For all experiments discussed in this paper, the inquery system using the and and or operators as defined in <ref> [Tur90] </ref> shall be considered the baseline system for purposes of comparison. For these query sets, experiments have shown that pnorm operators perform from 7% to 28% better than the baseline system in terms of average precision. Our goal was to achieve similar performance using pic matrices.

Reference-contexts: The results obtained here also suggest that some previous experimental results might merit a second look. For example, <ref> [Tur94] </ref> reports that natural language queries consistently outperform Boolean queries for experiments run on legal collections. The difference observed, however, is within the range of the improvements we have been able to obtain, suggesting that more effective implementations of the Boolean query operators might close the apparent gap.
