Title: Self-Stabilizing Running

Abstract: Legged robots can sustain stable dynamic locomotion without sensors or feedback. It is possible to construct a running robot that is inherently stable and needs no sensing to reject minor perturbations; it is therefore self-stabilizing. In contrast, most previous attempts to make robots run have used active, high bandwidth feedback control systems. We use a simplified monopod to give an understandable reason why self-stabilizing running should be possible. Physically realistic simulations running with one, two, or four legs demonstrate self-stabilizing running, as does a physical monopod robot.

Reference-contexts: Juggling is much like walking except that the actuator (paddle) is on the ground, rather than part of the leg. Researchers have accomplished stable juggling with feedback <ref> [1] </ref> and without feedback [10]. Schaal and Atkeson's work indicates that juggling can also be self-stabilizing. Simplified Monopod We have simulations of self-stabilizing quadrupeds, bipeds, and monopods. Numerical methods show that these simulations are stable, but do not give a good intuitive understanding of why the self-stabilizing robots work.

Reference-contexts: Previous dynamic legged robots, such as those presented in [7] [8] [4], did not take advantage of self-stabilizing running because the conditions required for stable running were not known. Other related work includes McGeer's passive dynamic walking and running machines [3] <ref> [2] </ref>. McGeer's devices locomote downhill by a simple interaction of gravity and inertia, with no actuators, no sensing, and no computers. In some respects, McGeer's work distills walking to its essence: a set of motions generated by a simple mechanism interacting with gravity, although his mechanism has some stability problems.

Reference-contexts: For the self-stabilizing quadruped in this paper, the phases between the legs are arbitrary. Therefore, it is capable of more gaits, including transverse and rotary gallops, than most other controllers such as the virtual leg controller [6].

Reference-contexts: Many items in common use, such as tables, automobiles, and airplanes are stable about their standard operating conditions. Tables remain standing, automobiles drive forward, and airplanes fly straight and level <ref> [5] </ref>. This reliable default behavior makes them easier to control. In contrast, most current legged robots rely on high bandwidth sensing and feedback for stability. Self-stabilizing running could eliminate most of the bandwidth normally required to control running.

Earlier approximations, such as an impulsive actuator and a massless foot, were solely to simplify the explaination of the self-stabilizing properties and are not present in the simulations.
