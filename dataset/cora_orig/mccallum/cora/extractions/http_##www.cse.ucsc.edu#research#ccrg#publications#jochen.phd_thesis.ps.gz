Reference-contexts: The latency of our algorithm in reseting sequence numbers and erasing old information is bounded only by the time it takes for an LSU to traverse the network, rather than by a global timer, which is the case in all previous reset schemes used or proposed to date (e.g., see <ref> [PVL92, APV94] </ref>). We note that, just as with other link state algorithms, the routing of user messages proceeds while the dissemination of link-state information is taking place. The following section states the goals for our reset mechanism. <p> A reset algorithm for IFP with goals similar to the above three has been sketched in <ref> [APV94] </ref>. According to this algorithm, whenever the sequence number of an LSU reaches its upper bound at some router, this router makes a reset request. When a request reaches a router other than the source, that router resets its sequence number to 0 and forwards the request.

Reference-contexts: In virtual circuit switching, a path is set up when a session is initiated and maintained during the life of the session; all data travels along this pre-established path. When datagram routing is used, each packet finds its own way through the network; successive packets may follow different routes <ref> [BG92] </ref>. The purpose of the routing algorithms is to set up hop-by-hop forwarding tables or routing tables at the routers. These tables specify the neighbor to which a data packet is forwarded towards its destination. <p> networks has proceeded in two main directions: distance-vector protocols in which routers exchange vectors of distances of preferred paths to known destinations, and link-state protocols in which routers replicate complete topology information with which they compute their preferred paths. 3 Most DVAs are based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF) <ref> [BG92] </ref>. In essence, nodes exchange information about the length of their paths to destinations; this information, together with the length of adjacent links, is used locally to compute the best path. <p> More specifically, a distributed termination-detection mechanism is necessary for a router to ascertain when a given update is valid and avoid the possibility of updates circulating in the network forever <ref> [BG92, BG94] </ref>. Termination-detection mechanisms based on sequence numbers similar to those used in a number of LSAs [BG92, Moy94, Per83] or diffusing computations [Gar92] can be used to validate updates. <p> More specifically, a distributed termination-detection mechanism is necessary for a router to ascertain when a given update is valid and avoid the possibility of updates circulating in the network forever [BG92, BG94]. Termination-detection mechanisms based on sequence numbers similar to those used in a number of LSAs <ref> [BG92, Moy94, Per83] </ref> or diffusing computations [Gar92] can be used to validate updates. A concrete embodiment of LVA for shortest-path routing, which we call LVA-SEN, is shown in the appendix of this chapter (Section 2.8. LVA-SEN determines the validity of updates using a sequence number for each link. <p> In practice, if finite sequence numbers are used to validate updates, a reset mechanism is needed to recycle sequence numbers. An age field serves this purpose <ref> [BG92] </ref>; when a link is deleted from the topology table, the router maintaining the table labels the link as deleted, 14 1. Check whether the update is valid. 2. <p> An update is discarded if it specifies a sequence number that is smaller than the one in the topology table. In this case, the receiving node prepares an update for the same link intended to correct the information stored by the neighbor that sent the update. Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [BG92] </ref>, or any other shortest-path algorithm, is run on the updated topology table to construct a new source graph, which constitutes a shortest-path tree; in this case, the new routing table is generated together with the source graph. <p> Therefore, the reliable broadcast mechanisms used in LSAs to ensure that all routers with a physical path to a source of link-state updates receives the most recent updates within a finite time (e.g., see <ref> [BG92, Gar92, Gaf87, HS89, Per83] </ref>) are not directly applicable to an LVA. Furthermore, as argued before, a router using LVA must explicitly state which links it stops using. compared to LSAs, even for the case of a fairly compact topology. <p> Corollary 1 then shows that routing tables do not contain any permanent loops. Verifying that finite 21 sequence numbers and age fields can be used correctly to validate updates can be done in a manner similar to that used for finite sequence-numbering schemes used in LSAs <ref> [BG92] </ref>. Correctness for LVA means that, within a finite time after t 0 , all routers obtain link-state information that allow them to compute loop-free paths that adhere to the constraints imposed by the local algorithms they use to compute preferred paths, and to forward packets incrementally. <p> This dissemination can take the form of broadcast, in which every network node (router) maintains the same topology map <ref> [BG92] </ref>, or selective distribution, in which each node maintains only the subset of the topology map it needs to perform correct routing, as described in the previous chapter. <p> This type of reset has two problems: erroneous LSU information has to propagate all the way to the source before it can be erased (a technique first suggested by Humblet <ref> [BG92] </ref>), and other than having a global timer for garbage collection, there is no provision for erasing an obsolete LSU after the failure of the source of the LSU or the partition of the network.

Reference-contexts: They should be as simple as possible, but must make efficient use of processing and memory resources, and utilize a minimum of the communication capacities. Routing algorithms should perform correctly when faced with unforeseen circumstances and prove stable under a variety of network conditions <ref> [Cis97, Mur96] </ref>. Cost metrics for links are chosen to determine paths through the network that are optimized according to policies set by network administrators. Metrics can be static or dynamic. The simplest static cost metric is to assign unit cost to every link, the resulting routing policy is minimum-hop routing. <p> As an example, the cost metric used in the ARPANET is based on a hop-normalized-delay function [KZ89, SADM95]. Cisco's IGRP and EIGRP protocols use a combination of internetwork delay, bandwidth, reliability, and load as its link metric <ref> [Cis97] </ref>. For quality of service routing, other parameters, such as the delay jitter or bandwidth guarantees will need to be taken into account.

Reference-contexts: We propose a new algorithm that achieves fast dissemination of up-to-date link-state information without periodic updates or age fields. The algorithm is based on a finite and linear sequence-number space and diffusing computations <ref> [DS80] </ref>. Most prior applications of diffusing computations to routing [JM82, Gar93] have focused on the dissemination of information regarding distances to destinations. <p> The following section outlines how our reset algorithm supports the three goals stated above. 3.3 Description of Reset Algorithm To validate LSUs with no need for periodic transmissions or age fields, we present a sequence-number reset algorithm based on diffusing computations <ref> [DS80] </ref>. The reset algorithm can be applied to both the replication of the same LSU at every router, or the selective dissemination of LSUs. <p> Replies do not need to transmit link information, but may carry a tag signaling the possibility of an error. Based on these queries and replies, our reset algorithm operates in a manner very similar to Dijkstra and Scholten's algorithm for diffusing computations <ref> [DS80] </ref>. A node that needs to reliably distribute information about a link through the network and detect the termination of this, sends queries instead of LSUs to all its neighbors and then waits until it receives a reply from each neighbor.

Reference-contexts: However, the requirement that the complete topology be broadcasted to every router does not scale well <ref> [ERH92] </ref>. There are two main scaling problems: flooding requires excessive communication resources, 6 and computing the routes using complete topology databases requires excessive processing resources. Examples for protocols based on LSAs are the inter-domain policy routing (IDPR) architecture [EST93], ISO IS-IS [ISO89], and OSPF [Moy94].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, aggregating information in an LSA is much more difficult than in a DVA (e.g., see <ref> [Gar88, RHE94] </ref>). Because LSAs require topology maps to be replicated at each router, different levels of topologies must be defined and routers must use multiple topology maps to aggregate information in an LSA (e.g., [Moy94, TRTN89]). <p> LVAs report links needed to reach destinations, not complete topology maps, and a destination can be a single entity or an aggregate of entities. Therefore, aggregation of information can take place in an LVA by adapting any of the area-based routing techniques proposed for DVAs in the past (e.g., <ref> [Gar88, KK77, Tsu88] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Dijkstra and Scholten's basic algorithm was used in <ref> [Gar89] </ref> to provide loop freedom in topology broadcast algorithms, assuming that the intelligent flooding protocol was used with no changes (i.e. aging and periodic retransmission are used to handle finite sequence numbers). A reset algorithm for IFP with goals similar to the above three has been sketched in [APV94].

Reference-contexts: In other approaches, additional information about the links is propagated to maintain the spanning tree of the neighboring nodes, or a synchronizing mechanism is used to ensure that for each destination, the routing table entries of all routers define a directed acyclic graph at all times <ref> [Gar93] </ref>. Path-finding algorithms exchange distance vectors containing the length and the second-to-last hop in that path [CRKG89, Gar86, Hum91, RF91, Mur96, GM97]. For any destination in an update message, the predecessor router or network is indicated in addition to the length of the path. <p> Hence, the routing tables computed by LVA with a correct path-selection algorithm do not contain permanent loops. q.e.d. 2.5 Complexity of LVA This section quantifies the communication complexity (i.e., number of messages needed in the worst case), time complexity (number of steps), computation complexity, and storage complexity <ref> [Gar93] </ref> of LVA for shortest-path routing after a single link change. 2.5.1 Communication Complexity The number of messages per link cost change is bounded by twice the number of links in the network. <p> Hence, the same upper bound of O (x) applies. This worst case is the same as the complexity of the best DVA <ref> [Gar93] </ref>. On the other hand, if the link costs reflect the delay of the links, the complexity for LVA reduces to O (d), where d is the (delay) diameter of the network. <p> We propose a new algorithm that achieves fast dissemination of up-to-date link-state information without periodic updates or age fields. The algorithm is based on a finite and linear sequence-number space and diffusing computations [DS80]. Most prior applications of diffusing computations to routing <ref> [JM82, Gar93] </ref> have focused on the dissemination of information regarding distances to destinations. The application of diffusing computations to the dissemination of link-state information has been proposed before only in the context of building a spanning tree over which link-state updates are distributed [Gar92].

Reference-contexts: LSUs must be sent reliably between neighbors. 50 The link-vector algorithm (LVA) introduced in <ref> [GB95] </ref> is based on the selective distribution of topology information, rather than on flooding. The purpose of this algorithm is to allow a router to maintain only the link-state information it needs to reach a destination, rather than the entire topology map. <p> In addition, the router tells its neighbors which links it no longer uses to reach destinations. A basic assumption for the correct operation of the LVA implementation introduced in <ref> [GB95] </ref> is that routers can determine whether an update contains up-to-date information using the same update validation scheme used for LSUs in IFP. <p> If the diffusing computation reaches the head of the link, then node i will notice any possible inconsistency with the information stored in its topology table. It will send a reply (to avoid deadlock), and an LSU with the correct information if necessary. By the correctness of LVA <ref> [GB95] </ref>, the content of this LSU will get to all nodes that need the information. Note that, due to the buffering of information received by an active node after the reply, the ongoing diffusing computation will not prevent the propagation of this information. <p> With LVA, this extra query is used to update the set of reporting nodes at the predecessor node. On the other hand, with IFP, the worst case always occurs because the whole network is flooded with the information, while LVA produces fewer messages in the average case <ref> [GB95] </ref>. 3.5.2 Time and Storage Complexity In the connected component of the network, the worst-case time complexity is O (x), where x is the number of affected routers. With IFP, x obviously is the number of nodes in the network, while with LVA it can be significantly less. <p> The proof of correctness consists of two parts: first, it is shown that ALVA terminates. The second part shows that the information in the network is consistent upon termination and thus correct routes have been computed. Both parts of the proof build on the properties proven for LVA <ref> [GB95] </ref> and extend the proofs for LVA to the hierarchical algorithm. The following lemmas constitute the proof. Lemma 4.2 Area-based LVA terminates within a finite amount of time after t 0 . <p> Then, we can use the same inductive argument as in the base case, using the links between k-level areas as hierarchical hops. This proves Lemma 4.3. q.e.d. 4.4 Performance Since LVA has been shown to outperform the ideal link-state algorithm in <ref> [GB95] </ref>, it can be expected that ALVA performs better than area-based schemes based on flooding, such as OSPF, by reducing the control traffic both within areas as well as across the backbone. To verify this expectation, we compared ALVA with OSPF in several simulations.

In this chapter, we introduce a new area-based hierarchical routing scheme that uses LVA as its basic routing algorithm.

Reference-contexts: To verify this expectation, we compared ALVA with OSPF in several simulations. Simulation were performed using random graphs with 100 nodes. Nodes had an average degree of approximately 3. Recent work <ref> [GR97] </ref> shows that this is a realistic node degree for in-ternetworks. The topologies were produced according to two general schemes. According to the first scheme, there is a backbone with 56 nodes, one area with 30 nodes, and 14 stub areas with one node each.

Reference-contexts: To cope with the inherent overhead of flooding, today's LSAs organize the network or internet into areas connected by a backbone. However, this imposes additional network configuration problems and, as results obtained by Garcia-Luna-Aceves and Zaumen indicate <ref> [GZ94] </ref>, areas must be chosen carefully, together with the masks used to hide information regarding destinations in an area, for any performance improvement to be obtained with respect to a "flat" LSA. Furthermore, aggregating information in an LSA is much more difficult than in a DVA (e.g., see [Gar88, RHE94]). <p> Although intended for wireless systems, it also provides point-to-point facilities that we used in our implementations. 2.6.1 Small Topology The results presented in this experiment are based on simulations for the DOE-ESNET topology <ref> [GZ94] </ref>; similar results were obtained for other smaller topologies. <p> Since all results are shown for specific topologies and all possible single events are covered in the simulations, no sampling errors can be given. ARPANET Topology The well known topology that we chose for our simulations is the ARPANET topology <ref> [GZ94] </ref>. This topology has 47 nodes and 69 links, giving it an average degree of 2.94. 35 changes, failures, and recoveries,) LVA sends on the average about half as many packets as LSA, and it needs fewer steps to converge..

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the reliable broadcast mechanisms used in LSAs to ensure that all routers with a physical path to a source of link-state updates receives the most recent updates within a finite time (e.g., see <ref> [BG92, Gar92, Gaf87, HS89, Per83] </ref>) are not directly applicable to an LVA.

Reference-contexts: There are two main scaling problems: flooding requires excessive communication resources, 6 and computing the routes using complete topology databases requires excessive processing resources. Examples for protocols based on LSAs are the inter-domain policy routing (IDPR) architecture [EST93], ISO IS-IS <ref> [ISO89] </ref>, and OSPF [Moy94].

Reference-contexts: However, an inherent limitation of DVAs is that routers exchange information regarding path characteristics, not link or node characteristics. Because of this, the storage and communication requirements of any DVA grows proportionally to the number of combinations of service types or policies <ref> [Jaf84] </ref>. Link-state algorithms (LSA) are based on the flooding of link information (topology broadcast). At every node, a topology database containing information about every link is maintained. To flood the network with link state information, the source of the information broadcasts it to all it neighbors. <p> Because LVAs exchange routing information that is related to link (and even node) characteristics, rather than path characteristics, this approach eliminates the complexity incurred with DVAs for routing under multiple constraints <ref> [Jaf84] </ref>. Regardless of the type of routing algorithm used, aggregation information (i.e., hierarchical routing) becomes a necessity to support routing in very large networks or internets. LVAs report links needed to reach destinations, not complete topology maps, and a destination can be a single entity or an aggregate of entities.

Reference-contexts: We propose a new algorithm that achieves fast dissemination of up-to-date link-state information without periodic updates or age fields. The algorithm is based on a finite and linear sequence-number space and diffusing computations [DS80]. Most prior applications of diffusing computations to routing <ref> [JM82, Gar93] </ref> have focused on the dissemination of information regarding distances to destinations. The application of diffusing computations to the dissemination of link-state information has been proposed before only in the context of building a spanning tree over which link-state updates are distributed [Gar92].

Reference-contexts: The main idea in aggregation schemes is that a router keeps in its database one entry per node or link that is "close," and an entry for a set of nodes or links further away <ref> [Kam76] </ref>. To achieve this, hierarchies of addresses are formed by grouping together ("clustering") nodes that are close together.

Reference-contexts: LVAs report links needed to reach destinations, not complete topology maps, and a destination can be a single entity or an aggregate of entities. Therefore, aggregation of information can take place in an LVA by adapting any of the area-based routing techniques proposed for DVAs in the past (e.g., <ref> [Gar88, KK77, Tsu88] </ref>). <p> The first such proposal was Mc-Quillian's [McQ74]; this proposal was analyzed in detail by Kamoun and Kleinrock <ref> [KK77] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Multimedia and teleconferencing applications using the Internet create a demand for quality of service (QoS) guarantees, such as a guaranteed bandwidth and delays. To provide such guarantees, it is necessary to avoid congestion in the network. Today's routing algorithms are poorly integrated with congestion control <ref> [Kou97] </ref>. To be able to support QoS, congestion control and avoidance need to be better integrated with the routing decisions.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not desirable that link costs change too frequently, because this would lead to excessive routing overhead and may cause oscillatory behavior. As an example, the cost metric used in the ARPANET is based on a hop-normalized-delay function <ref> [KZ89, SADM95] </ref>. Cisco's IGRP and EIGRP protocols use a combination of internetwork delay, bandwidth, reliability, and load as its link metric [Cis97]. For quality of service routing, other parameters, such as the delay jitter or bandwidth guarantees will need to be taken into account.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, the routing algorithm uses a single routing table with entries to individual or aggregated destinations <ref> [McQ74] </ref>.

In other approaches, additional information about the links is propagated to maintain the spanning tree of the neighboring nodes, or a synchronizing mechanism is used to ensure that for each destination, the routing table entries of all routers define a directed acyclic graph at all times [Gar93].

Reference-contexts: Because LSAs require topology maps to be replicated at each router, different levels of topologies must be defined and routers must use multiple topology maps to aggregate information in an LSA (e.g., <ref> [Moy94, TRTN89] </ref>). In contrast, aggregating information in DVAs is very simple, because DVA exchanges information about distances to destinations, and such destinations can be a single network entity (e.g., router, network, host) or a group of entities (e.g., areas, confederations, clusters). <p> The first such proposal was Mc-Quillian's [McQ74]; this proposal was analyzed in detail by Kamoun and Kleinrock [KK77]. Most prior proposals on hierarchical routing have routing algorithms based on topology broadcast or variations of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm. Ramamoorthy et al. <ref> [RT83, TRTN89] </ref> proposed an algorithm based on link-state information for hierarchical routing.

Reference-contexts: LVAs report links needed to reach destinations, not complete topology maps, and a destination can be a single entity or an aggregate of entities. Therefore, aggregation of information can take place in an LVA by adapting any of the area-based routing techniques proposed for DVAs in the past (e.g., <ref> [Gar88, KK77, Tsu88] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: LVA outperformed LSA in terms of messages sent and number of steps until convergence, and its storage requirements are significantly lower than those of LSA. 36 2.6.3 Random Topologies Random topologies were obtained using the exponential model proposed in <ref> [ZCB96] </ref>. All topologies generated this way have 100 nodes (the maximum number allowed in CPT) and a varying number of links. <p> To obtain random topologies according to these schemes, for each area (including the backbone) nodes are places randomly in a plane. Any two nodes u; v within the area are then connected according to the exponential model as proposed by Zegura et al. <ref> [ZCB96] </ref>, i.e., with probability P (u; v) = ffe Ld ; where d is the Euclidean distance between u and v, L is the maximum distance between any two nodes, and 0 &lt; ff 1 is a parameter of the model.
