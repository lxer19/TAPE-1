Title: Experimental Evaluation of a Reliable Multicast Application  
Author: Marcel Kornacker and L. Kristin Wright 
Date: May 16, 1997  
Abstract: Reliable multicast promises to solve the problems of a number of newly emerging distributed applications. A prominent example is so-called push technology, which would greatly benefit from multicast to reduce its bandwith requirements, but also needs TCP-like reliability of delivery. A crucial aspect of the scalability of any protocol that implements reliable multicast is how well its loss recovery mechanisms cope with growing group size and dispersion. Since losses are inevitable in large and dispersed groups of receivers, loss recovery mechanisms should ideally keep repair traffic to a minimum to limit the extra bandwidth requirements. Although reliable multicast in general and scalable loss recovery in particular is a popular topic in the research community, there have only been simulation studies of these so far. In this paper, we present an experimental study of the loss recovery mechanisms of an existing application, WebCanal, that implements reliable multicast. The goal of the study was to test the scalability of WebCanal's reliable multicast protocol, LRMP, in a wide-area scenario. In order to do this in a LAN environment, we deployed a software routing component that emulated a WAN-like topology with WAN-like transmission delays. The results of the study indicate that loss recovery mechanisms in reliable multicast protocols must limit the scope of repair traffic as well as duplicate repair packets in order to be scalable. The examined protocol was found lacking in both areas.

Finally, we could further our current results by implementing alternative queueing and scheduling policies in our router and observing any change in behavior. request as the number of nodes increases.

Reference-contexts: Once within a WebCanal session, any HTML document that the user requests is fetched via unicast by the WebCanal proxy, displayed in the browser window, and multicast to the other session members. WebCanal uses LRMP, an extension of RTP/RTCP <ref> [HSJ96] </ref>, to multicast documents. To provide reliability and ordered delivery, LRMP implements a simplified version of SRM's recovery policies.
