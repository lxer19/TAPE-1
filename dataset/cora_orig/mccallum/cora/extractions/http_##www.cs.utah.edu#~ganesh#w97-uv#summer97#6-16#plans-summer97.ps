Title: Utah Verifier Version 1|dRaFt

Abstract: In this report, I shall outline my plans for concerted action on part of the UV project members during the Summer quarter of 1997 which should result in the creation of Utah Verifier Version 1 (UV v1.0). I hope that we will continually refine the plan of action stated herein as well as follow it as best as we can. As the problem we have to attack is non-trivial in nature, and as our resources (mainly our time) are severely limited, we must make the best use of our resources. A few watchwords I want to propose are: (i) concerted action to solve one problem properly, (ii) not pursue FM for FM's sake (never become "screw-driver-only" mechanics or "wrench-only mechanics" [1]), (iii) highest communication efficiency, and (iv) when the going gets tough, stop and think: : : optimistically!

Reference-contexts: We will employ two driving examples to help situate ourselves properly into the exact same design contexts as a user of UV v1.0 would: (i) the Avalanche Widget design based on HP's proprietory Runway bus, and (ii) the PCI-bus <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: systems will involve many internal busses; bugs in such systems would simply be unacceptable; * efforts in extending hardware description languages (HDLs) such VHDL and Verilog towards system-level design are headed the "bus way" (involve issues similar to that we would face), as evidenced by the system-level design language (SLDL, <ref> [3] </ref>) and other efforts; * experts (e.g. [4, 5]) opine that this is where FM researchers must focus; * startup company [6] by one of the brightest FM researchers in my opinion is focussing on some system-level problems (and also has used the PCI bus as a benchmark!) * PCI cores
