Abstract: If r = 0 there is nothing to prove, so we assume r &gt; 0. We have: ( ~ D + ~ A) r T 1 B = [ ~ D( ~ D + ~ A) r1 T 1 B + ~ A( ~ D + ~ A) r1 T 1 B]: Using equation (34) and the inductive assumption we have: ( ~ D + ~ A) r T 1 B = [ ~ DT 1 (D + A) r1 B + T 1 A(D + A) r1 B]: Since ~ DT 1 = T 1 D, the previous equation gives us the inductive step. Combining now equation (34) with equation (35), we have: A(A + D) k2 B = T ~ AT 1 (A + D) k2 B 8 k 2: Since the pair (A + D; B) is controllable, the previous equation implies (31), as desired. To complete our proof, now we establish the Claim. Equation (33) says: n X c jk m ki 0 (&lt; B k ; u &gt;) = k=1 for all j = 1; : : : ; p, and all i = 1; : : : ; m. Notice that this equation is of the same type as equation (30). Thus arguing as in that case, we have: c jk m ki = ~c jl(k) n l(k)i 8 j; k; i: Fix two arbitrary indexes k; i. By the assumption on the matrix C, there exists j such that c jk 6= 0, which, in turn, implies ~c jl(k) = fi(k)c jk 6= 0. So, using the previous equation, we have: m ki = fi(k)n l(k)i 8 k; i; which is equivalent to M = T N , as desired. [1] Albertini, F., and E.D.
