Abstract: Deregulation and restructuring have become unavoidable trends to the power industry recently, in order to increase its efficiency, to reduce operation costs, or to provide customers a better service. The once centralized system planning and management must be remodeled to reflect the changes in the market environment. We propose and have developed a multi-agent based system to assist players, such as, owners of power generation stations, owners of transmission lines, and groups of consumers, to select partners to form coalitions. The system provides a cooperation plan and its associated cost allocation plan for the user to support its decision making process. Among several coalition formation and cost allocation criteria, we have selected the Bilateral Shapley Value (BSV) as the theoretical foundation to develop the system. We have tested the multi-agent system with a classical transmission expansion example.

Reference-contexts: Several techniques have been used to assist the planning of transmission expansion. For example, techniques based on mathematical programming, such as Branch-and-Bound [4, 5, 12], techniques based on sensitivity analysis <ref> [1, 13] </ref>, and techniques that use a hybrid of neural networks and genetic algorithms [19]. Normally, planning for expansion is a combinatorial problem, and that makes it very difficult to find reasonable solutions within short computational time if the number of nodes or number of participants is large.

[3] have shown that investment incentives and market mechanisms have been important to guarantee a fair and just outcome. Planning for transmission expansion involves decisions from the players over several scenarios, which include the network topology, suppliers, customers, and/or owners of transmission lines.

Reference-contexts: To solve such problems, a solution needs to guarantee that the other operational constraints, such as, capacity of power transmission, can be satisfied. Several techniques have been used to assist the planning of transmission expansion. For example, techniques based on mathematical programming, such as Branch-and-Bound <ref> [4, 5, 12] </ref>, techniques based on sensitivity analysis [1, 13], and techniques that use a hybrid of neural networks and genetic algorithms [19].

Reference-contexts: Using game theory to assist in the formation of coalitions is one approach to solve the transmission expansion problem. In particular, Gately used the Shapley value to set up regional cooperation for investment in expansion and cost allocation <ref> [6] </ref>. Gatelys approach was a centralized one, where a central planner is needed to be in charge of cost allocation. <p> Cooperative game theory has proved to be useful when combined with a DAI approach to address and solve some pending issues in deregulated power transmission markets <ref> [6, 11] </ref>. <p> However, the Shapley Value [15] has been used to solve such problems <ref> [6] </ref>. The Shapley Value calculates a fair division of the utility, based on individuals contributions, among the members in a coalition. It is a solution concept for a n-person cooperative game.
