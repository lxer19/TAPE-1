Abstract: In this paper, we derive a new maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) receiver that operates on fractionally-spaced samples obtained at the output of an analog filter matched to the transmit pulse-shaping filter. A fractional MLSE receiver was proposed by Hamied et al. that requires a fixed noise-whitening filter to whiten noise samples at the output of the transmit matched filter. Due to the presence of nulls in the Nyquist bandwidth of practical pulse-shaping filters like the square-root raised cosine filter, the noise-whitening filter has a long slowly-damped delay response and any practical length truncation results in significant distortion. The new receiver does not need noise-whitening. The branch metric of the Viterbi algorithm in the receiver accounts for the correlation in the noise samples. The receiver is insensitive to sampler timing phase. An adaptive form of the receiver requires only one step prediction of medium response coefficients. These features make the receiver attractive for fast time-varying channels.

Reference-contexts: Forney [2] and Ungerboeck [9] derived MLSE receivers for known time-invariant channels. The latter formulation was extended for the case of known time-varying channels by Bottomley et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Adaptive channel estimation using (tentative) decision feedback is assumed in the case of unknown time-varying channels. In wireless communication systems, the channel is generally considered as comprising a time-invariant transmit (pulse-shaping) filter followed by a time-varying transmission medium. <p> However, we note that practical pulse-shaping filters like the square-root raised cosine filter have nulls in the Nyquist spectrum, due to which the noise-whitening filter has a long slowly-damped delay response. Any practical length truncation of the filter leads to severe distortion. 2 Following the development in <ref> [1] </ref>, we derive an Ungerboeck-type receiver which does not need noise-whitening. The branch metric of the Viterbi algorithm accounts for the correlation in the noise samples affecting the fractionally sampled statistic obtained at the output of a transmit matched filter. <p> It is assumed that y (t) is band-limited in the receiver front end, using a bandwidth larger than the signal bandwidth, so that the integral in (6) is well defined. 4 The Ungerboeck-Bottomley formulation In this section, we re-derive an MLSE receiver following the development of Bottomley et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. The receiver is an extension of Ungerboeck's MLSE formulation [9] to time-varying channels. <p> Since the transmit filter response is known at the receiver, channel estimation can be improved by adapting the medium response coefficients directly instead of adapting the s parameters. The formulation of Section 4 can be modified for this purpose as shown in <ref> [1] </ref> for the case of symbol-spaced channel models. <p> The spectrum exhibits nulls in the Nyquist bandwidth 1=T (corresponding to M = 2). This is true for all SRRC pulses with roll off factor fi 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The noise-whitening filter does not exist for these pulses as the nulls in the Nyquist band can not be inverted. Fig. 4 shows the sampled autocorrelation spectra for the same SRRC pulses but with a truncation of 10 symbols. <p> given by (38) simplifies to 0 L c X Re &lt; c fl (j; n) ff fl 2 0 L c j X c (j + l; n) ff njl A L q X r q (i) l=0 3 9 ; which reduces to the "Partial Ungerboeck" formulation of Bottomley <ref> [1] </ref> for the case of Nyquist pulse-shaping (i.e. r q (n) = ffi (n)). 9 Conclusions In this paper, we derived a new fractional MLSE receiver for time-varying channels.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) is an optimum detection technique for signals corrupted with intersymbol interference (ISI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Forney <ref> [2] </ref> and Ungerboeck [9] derived MLSE receivers for known time-invariant channels. The latter formulation was extended for the case of known time-varying channels by Bottomley et al. [1]. Adaptive channel estimation using (tentative) decision feedback is assumed in the case of unknown time-varying channels.

Reference-contexts: They, however, assume that the noise affecting the sampled statistic is white. The branch metric of the Viterbi algorithm ignores the correlation in the noise samples. As a result the performance improvement is marginal. Hamied et al. <ref> [3] </ref> derived an MLSE receiver for systems that employ at most 100% excess bandwidth. Their receiver employs a transmit matched filter followed by a fractional sampler and a fixed noise-whitening filter. The statistic thus obtained is white. <p> In Section 4, we re-visit the Ungerboeck-Bottomley formulation for time-varying channels. We describe the channel model for a system with excess signal bandwidth in Section 5. A fractional Ungerboeck-type receiver is then derived in Section 6. Section 7 deals with the receiver of Hamied et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. A new fractional MLSE receiver that does not need noise-whitening and minimizes channel prediction is described in Section 8. 2 System model Consider the transmission of linearly-modulated digital data over a linear, time-dispersive medium. The system model consists of a transmitter, a linear time-varying transmission medium and a receiver. <p> Symbol-spaced channel models have been used to develop MLSE receivers [8, 4]. Symbol-spaced MLSE receivers yield close to optimum performance if the excess signal bandwidth (W T in excess of 1 2 ) is small. However, the performance of these receivers is highly sensitive to the timing phase <ref> [3] </ref> in the presence of excess bandwidth. This is due to the inability of a symbol-spaced transversal filter to invert a null in the sampled signal spectrum without excessive noise enhancement [7]. <p> Let the D-transform of the transmit filter autocorrelation function r q (n) (the sampled autocorrelation spectrum) be defined as R q (D) = n=L q where D stands for fractional symbol duration. Hamied et al. <ref> [3] </ref> obtain an adaptive MLSE receiver by assuming that the statistic fY ()g obtained at the output of the front-end filter in Fig. 2 can be whitened by using a fixed noise-whitening filter. <p> The error would increase with the length of the SRRC pulse because the nulls would be deeper as demonstrated in Fig. 3. 8 A new fractional MLSE receiver In this section, we derive an alternative fractional MLSE receiver that does not require noise-whitening unlike the receiver of Hamied et al. <ref> [3] </ref>.

The coefficients of the front-end filter and the sampled channel autocorrelation function `s' are adapted using a stochastic steepest descent algorithm.
