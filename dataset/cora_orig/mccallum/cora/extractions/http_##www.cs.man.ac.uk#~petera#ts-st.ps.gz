Reference-contexts: This is to weaken ZFC to a constructive set theory. In <ref> [Aczel 78] </ref> a constructive set theory CZF was introduced that is a subtheory of ZF whose logic is intuitionistic. <p> This is the sets-as-trees interpretation that was introduced and developed in <ref> [Aczel 78, Aczel 82, Aczel 86] </ref> and has also been used in [Griffor and Rathjen 94, Griffor and Rathjen 96]. It is used to interprete a set theory in a type theory. <p> It is used to interprete a set theory in a type theory. The idea for the original interpretation, in <ref> [Aczel 78] </ref>, of CZF in MLWU was to interprete the sets of CZF as the well-founded trees of the type V = (W x : U)x, the membership and equality relations of CZF being interpreted as terms * V , = V of type V ! (V ! U).

Reference-contexts: Here we will consider the extension CZF + = CZF + REA of CZF obtained by adding to CZF the following axiom, that was first introduced in <ref> [Aczel 86] </ref>. <p> Instead we can apply Theorem 5.2 of <ref> [Aczel 86] </ref> to see that the lemma is provable in CZF + . 7 So we now have the following result. Theorem 2.4 (CZF + ) The type theory MLW ext is sound. <p> This is the sets-as-trees interpretation that was introduced and developed in <ref> [Aczel 78, Aczel 82, Aczel 86] </ref> and has also been used in [Griffor and Rathjen 94, Griffor and Rathjen 96]. It is used to interprete a set theory in a type theory. <p> In this way a proof theoretic reduction of CZF to MLWU is obtained that will be expressed as 9 CZF ST MLWU. In fact, as shown in <ref> [Aczel 86] </ref>, we get CZF + ST MLWU: Also, it is easy to see that, using the rule EM of MLWU + EM we can justify both the law of excluded middle and global choice for the set theory so as to get the reduction ZFGC ST MLWU + EM: Unfortunately

Reference-contexts: get the reduction MLW ext U + EM T S ZFGC 1 : To extend the T S interpretation of MLW ext in CZF + we add to CZF + an individual constant u and axioms expressing that u is an inaccessible set in the sense of Griffor and Rathjen, <ref> [Griffor and Rathjen 96] </ref> 8 We write CZF + u for the resulting theory. <p> This is the sets-as-trees interpretation that was introduced and developed in [Aczel 78, Aczel 82, Aczel 86] and has also been used in <ref> [Griffor and Rathjen 94, Griffor and Rathjen 96] </ref>.
