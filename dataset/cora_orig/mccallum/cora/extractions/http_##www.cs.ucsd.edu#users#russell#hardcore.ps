Abstract: Consider a decision problem that cannot be 1 ffi approximated by circuits of a given size in the sense that any such circuit fails to give the correct answer on at least a ffi fraction of instances. We show that for any such problem there is a specific "hard-core" set of inputs which is at least a ffi fraction of all inputs and on which no circuit of a slightly smaller size can get even a small advantage over a random guess. More generally, our argument holds for any non-uniform model of computation closed under majorities. We apply this result to get a new proof of the Yao XOR lemma [Y], and to get a related XOR lemma for inputs that are only k-wise independent.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it would be nice to have a version of the XOR lemma that did not increase the input size significantly. An analagous result for amplifying the hardness of one-way functions without substantially increasing the input length appears in <ref> [GILVZ] </ref>. We are not quite able to achieve the full length-preserving reduction from a problem that is hard to solve 1 ffi fraction of the time by exponential size circuits to one that is hard to approximate with some exponential advantage .

Such results are called "direct product theorems". Here, we give a new proof of a version of this lemma via a result of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: However, the candidates for such a problem are more likely to be shown to be hard some fraction of the time than to be directly shown hard to even get a small advantage on. For example, Lipton <ref> [Li] </ref> gives a self-reduction for the permanent problem that shows that if there is a circuit for this problem that succeed on a 1 1=2n fraction of random n fi n matrices, then there is one not much bigger that compute the permanent for all such matrices.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar to that taken by Lipton and Young <ref> [LY] </ref>. They were interested in finding a small hard-core distribu tion for the problem; we want to find a large one. 4 First Proof of Existence of Hard Core Measures The two proofs give somewhat different and incomparable quantitative bounds, so we state both as distinct lemmas.

Reference-contexts: This reduction can be used to improve the simulation time in the determinization of probabilistic algorithms based on somewhat hard problems using the approach from <ref> [NW] </ref>, although in general the deterministic time to simualate BP P will remain quasi-polynomial rather than polynomial. <p> This contradicts the assumption that the set was hard-core. 2 8 An amplification lemma for k-wise independent inputs Nisan and Wigderson showed that a problem in EX-PTIME for which no circuit of exponential-size could achieve even an exponentially small advantage, then P = BP P <ref> [NW] </ref>. They use hard instances of the problem of logarithmic size as the seed for a pseudorandom generator.
