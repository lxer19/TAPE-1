Abstract: We consider the fltting of tensor product parametric spline surfaces to gridded data. The continuity of the surface is provided by the basis chosen. When tensor product splines are used with gridded data, the surface fltting problem decomposes into a sequence of curve fltting processes, making the computations particularly e-cient. The use of a hierarchical representation for the surface adds further e-ciency by adaptively decomposing the fltting process into subproblems involving only a portion of the data. Hierarchy also provides a means of storing the resulting surface in a compressed format. Our approach is compared to multiresolution analysis and the use of wavelets.

Reference-contexts: The only reflnement permitted for such splines is to allow the insertion of exactly one knot at the midpoint between every two existing knots.

Reference-contexts: The broader class of multi-patch tensor product spline surfaces; e.g. B-splines, fl-splines, or their rational counterparts, provide continuity without the imposition of constraints in the least squares fltting process. The hierarchical representation of <ref> [4] </ref> allows an adaptive approach to the fltting process. When areas of large scale data have been flt within a spec-ifled tolerance by a surface having a certain level of reflnement, there may remain isolated areas of data that exceed tolerance. <p> C right1 (v 0 ) C right1 (v 1 ) C right1 (v N ) 3 7 5 Such trimmed systems allow the imposition of a hierarchy upon the fltting process, with the potential of gaining substantial e-ciency, as we shall show in Section 6. 6 Hierarchical Representation In <ref> [4] </ref> a compact means of representing spline surfaces derived from successive reflnement was described. There were three essential features of this representation. <p> To flt an overlay surface at level k + 1 of reflnement, the overlay is flrst generated as referenced to the surface of level k from which it is derived. The fltting process is viewed as modifying the ofiset information of the overlay <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus the least squares equations become B (R + O)C T = P (46) rather than (5), and the variables of the fltting process can be regarded as the ofisets O i;j . <p> The gains provided by a wavelet approach depend fundamentally on the ability to precompute the wavelet basis. The hierarchical representation <ref> [4] </ref> that we wish to obtain involves geometric information not contained in a wavelet representation. Specifically, each reflnement surface produced during the fltting process has control vertices represented in coordinate frames sited upon the parent surface from which it was obtained. <p> Plate 15 shows the corresponding residuals, all of which are within tolerance. The flnal surface has 1177 bicubic patches, which, counting patch adjacency, the sharing of control vertices, and econimizations for zero ofisets <ref> [4] </ref>, results in a signiflcant reduction in storage from the original data.

For the purposes of hierarchical fltting, the constraints of interest to us are those that flx the values the surface around its perimeter.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [9] </ref> an adaptive process was presented for fltting surface data with a geometrically continuous collection of rectangular Bezier patches. <p> Geometric continuity was provided by using constrained least squares as the fltting process, with the constraints imposing the continuity conditions of tensor product fl-splines. The data used in <ref> [9] </ref> was organized in a rectangular array; that is, it was gridded. This is the output format typical of systematic measuring devices 1 such as laser rangers, CAT imagery systems, and optical scanners. <p> The surface produced can be modifled using the methods of [4], and the editor of that reference was used as the means of rendering 17 the successive flts. Plate 17 shows data, kindly provided by Demitri Terzopoulos, that was used in <ref> [9] </ref>. As in Plate 1, the rendering is performed using rectangles from successions of data points and shading the resulting polygonal surface. Plate 18 shows a succession of spline surfaces produced from midpoint reflnements, and Plate 19 shows an enlarged view of the flnal flt in Plate 18.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms are given for computing the minimally supported B-wavelets in this setting. A further construction method for computing spline wavelets that ex tends to discrete inner products; i.e., P i f (u i )g (u i ) instead of R +1 is given in <ref> [10] </ref>. This is the setting that corresponds to the surface fltting approach we are using. However, three obstacles stand in our way of obtaining our surface flts via B-wavelets: In our setting we wish to determine the position at which knots will be inserted dynamically.
