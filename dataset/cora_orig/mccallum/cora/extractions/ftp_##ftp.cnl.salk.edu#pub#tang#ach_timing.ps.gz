Abstract: Neuromodulation can change not only the mean firing rate of a neuron, but also its pattern of firing. Therefore, a reliable neural coding scheme, whether a rate coding or a spike time based coding, must be robust in a dynamic neuromodulatory environment. The common observation that cholinergic modulation leads to a reduction in spike frequency adaptation implies a modification of spike timing, which would make a neural code based on precise spike timing difficult to maintain. In this paper, the effects of cholinergic modulation were studied to test the hypothesis that precise spike timing can serve as a reliable neural code. Using the whole cell patch-clamp technique in rat neocortical slice preparation and compartmental modeling techniques, we show that cholin-ergic modulation, surprisingly, preserved spike timing in response to a fluctuating inputs that resembles in vivo conditions. This result suggests that in vivo spike timing may be much more resistant to changes in neuromodulator concentrations than previous physiological studies have implied.

Reference-contexts: The amplitude of fluctuation was such that the subthreshold membrane potential fluctuation observed in our experiments were comparable to that in whole-cell patch clamp study in vivo <ref> (Ferster and Jagadeesh 1992) </ref>. The cholinergic agonist carbachol at concentrations of 5, 7.5, 15, 30 M was delivered through bath perfusion (perfusion time: between 1 and 6 min). For each cell, three sets of blocks were recorded before, during and after carbachol perfusion at a given concentration.

Reference-contexts: Each block contained 20 trials of stimulation under identical experimental conditions. 2.2 Simulation We used a compartmental model of a neocortical neuron to explore the contribution of three potassium conductances affected by cholinergic modulation <ref> (Madison et al. 1987) </ref>. Simulations were performed in a reduced 9 compartment model, based on a layer 2 pyramidal cell reconstruction using the NEURON program. The model had five conductances: g Na , g K - , g K M , g Ca , g K (Ca) .

Reference-contexts: This view has been challenged by a number of recent studies, in which highly repeatable temporal patterns of spikes can be observed both in vivo (Bair and Koch 1996; Abeles et al. 1993) and in vitro <ref> (Mainen and Sejnowski 1994) </ref>. Furthermore, application of information theory to the coding problem in the frog and house fly (Bialek et al. 1991; Bialek and Rieke 1992) suggested that additional information could be extracted from spike timing. <p> Coronal slices of 400 m were prepared from 14 to 18 days old Long Evans rats (for details see <ref> (Mainen and Se-jnowski 1994) </ref>. Spike trains elicited by current injection of 900 ms were recorded for the square pulse inputs and fluctuating inputs with equal mean synaptic inputs, in the absence and presence of a cholinergic agonist carbachol. <p> An event was then defined as a period of increase in instantaneous firing rate that is greater than a threshold level (set at 3 times of the mean firing rate within the block of trials) <ref> (Mainen and Sejnowski 1994) </ref>. The effect of carbachol on spike timing under fluctuating inputs was quantified by defining the displacement in spike timing for each event, d i , as the time difference between the nearest peaks of the events under carbachol and control condition.
