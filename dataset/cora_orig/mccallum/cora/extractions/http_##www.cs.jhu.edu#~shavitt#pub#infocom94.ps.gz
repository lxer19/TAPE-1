Abstract: Ring network architectures that employ spatial reuse permit concurrent transmissions of messages over different links. While spatial reuse increases network throughput, it may also cause starvation of nodes. To alleviate this problem, various policies have been suggested in the literature. In this paper we concentrate on a class of such policies that achieve fairness by allocating transmission quotas to nodes. For such policies, we provide mechanisms for improving delays and increasing overall throughput without compromising fairness.

Reference-contexts: The value of ff is assumed known to all nodes through some standard control mechanism such as the utilization update algorithm of [7]. It could also be obtained using an algorithm based on two rotating fields, such as the Token Ring priority algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition to protecting synchronous traffic by limiting the amount of asynchronous traffic that can compete with it, we also give priority to synchronous packets over asynchronous ones at each node.

Reference-contexts: For such traffic, an appropriate throughput performance criterion for each node is the average number of packets that the node is able to transmit in the long run. Based on this performance criterion, a well known optimization problem that is associated with fairness is the max-min optimization <ref> [2] </ref>, where each node gets the largest possible throughput that does not impact nodes with lower throughputs. While a max-min fair point is satisfactory in many situations, it may be unnecessarily restrictive for the system we consider in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recent increase in transmission speeds has resulted in the emergence of new networking standards and architectures. In the local and metropolitan area (LAN/MAN) environments, the availability of greater transmission speeds has changed many of the assumptions traditionally made when comparing performances of various architectures <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. In particular, transmission and buffering delays which used to be a major concern, now typically represent only a small fraction of the overall end-to-end delay which is dominated by the propagation delay.

Reference-contexts: HOL delay or rather the range of its variations is a major component in the transmission jitter that the ring introduces <ref> [5] </ref>. While the objectives of achieving high throughput and low HOL delays are often conflicting, a reasonable trade-off is demonstrated here through a number of improvements to the distributed fairness algorithm in [8], which we describe below.

Reference-contexts: both asynchronous and synchronous traffics coexist on the same ring, and investigate a simple approach that builds on the new mechanisms introduced in previous sections to accommodate both traffic types. 2 Improving Packet Delays Throughout this paper, we consider a bidirectional ring (extensions to a unidirectional ring are addressed in <ref> [6] </ref>) with n nodes, that employs the SAT algorithm described in [8]. A packet generated by a node is sent over the side of the ring for which the destination node is at a minimal hop distance. <p> Under the SAT algorithm, about 5% of the packets of node #39 have HOL delays larger than 5RTD, while the percentage is (almost) zero when the quota adaptation algorithm is used. Details of this and the next experiment can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 2.1.3 Communication with a File Server Since there is no spatial reuse in this case, the throughput is the same under both algorithms. The tail probabilities are now larger under both algorithms, since this is the scenario under which maximal HOL delays may occur. <p> than the value used by a node when it last allocated itself quotas, the node is not allowed to increase its quota as this can result in significant delay increases for other nodes in a number of scenarios. 4.1 Simulation Results The details of the simulation can be found in <ref> [6] </ref> The main conclusions are the following. Under light loads, putting the active node counter on the INFO signal made a small difference compared to the algorithm where the quota allocation counter was rotating with the SAT. This difference remained small even ring for loads of 90%. <p> It should be apparent from the above discussions that the proposed traffic integration method heavily favors synchronous traffic, and should therefore easily guarantee that it sees adequate performances. This has indeed been verified in the many simulations scenarios we have considered in <ref> [6] </ref>. The more important issue is then to assess the impact of this approach on the level of performance seen by asynchronous traffic. The simulation experiments concentrated, therefore, on understanding the performance implications of the proposed mechanism on the asynchronous traffic. <p> The simulation experiments concentrated, therefore, on understanding the performance implications of the proposed mechanism on the asynchronous traffic. The results show that while asynchronous throughput is slightly degraded it still remains at a reasonable level thanks to the availability of the INFO mechanism (see <ref> [6] </ref>).

Synchronous sessions will reserve bandwidth in a way similar to that described in <ref> [8] </ref>. Session j of node i computes the amount of bandwidth ff ij it needs and proceeds to reserve this bandwidth on all the associated links. We limit the amount of bandwidth allocated to synchronous traffic on any link to no more than ff MAX .

Reference-contexts: The SAT algorithm is effective not only at preventing nodes from starving but also at ensuring that they share ring bandwidth fairly and effectively, i.e., full utilization of the maximally loaded link equally shared between nodes <ref> [12] </ref>. The SAT algorithm has, however, a number of shortcomings with respect to access delay (HOL delay) and total ring throughput. <p> A second disadvantage of the SAT algorithm is that the SAT rotation cycle is determined by the most heavily loaded links on the ring <ref> [12] </ref> and this may result in unnecessary losses of throughput in asymmetrically loaded rings. <p> When all nodes have equal quota, it is shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that as the quota sizes increase the SAT algorithm provides node throughputs that are converging to the point that maximizes the minimum throughput in the network. However, the SAT algorithm equalizes the throughputs of all nodes (that have enough to transmit). <p> Therefore, when ring traffic is asymmetric, a possible increase in throughput of some nodes without penalizing others is lost. The quota adaptation algorithm improves the HOL delays of the SAT algorithm but cannot correct this throughput problem. It can be shown <ref> [12] </ref>, that the problem can be solved by allocating different quotas to nodes as a function of their traffic distribution.
