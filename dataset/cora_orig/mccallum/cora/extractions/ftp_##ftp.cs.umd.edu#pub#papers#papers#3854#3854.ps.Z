Abstract: In current windowing environments, individual windows are treated independently, making it difficult for users to coordinate information across multiple windows. While coordinated multi-window strategies are increasingly used in visualization and web user interfaces, designs are inflexible and haphazard. The space of such linked-window strategies is not well understood and largely unexplored. This paper presents a taxonomy of coordinations, identifies important components, and reviews example interfaces. This 2x3 taxonomy provides guidelines for designers of applications, user interface toolkits, and window managers. We hope to encourage construction of generalized, end-user programmable, robust, multiple-window coordination capabilities.

Reference-contexts: A. Same information collections When users select (highlight, paint, brush) an item (or set of items) in one view, the system immediately highlights the equivalent item (or set), representing the same underlying data elements, in the other views. Many data analysis systems (e.g. Spotfire [IVE97], XGobi <ref> [BCS96] </ref>) use this coordination to visualize high-dimensional data point sets with multiple coordinated 2D scatter plots ([MSB90] credits invention to C. Newton in 1978). These systems provide many options for selection method (single, cumulative, box, lasso, etc.) [Wil96] and highlight style (color, size, glyph, etc.). <p> ADVANCED COORDINATION Some systems allow users to interactively link a set of windows within the system so users can choose which windows participate in specific coordinations. LinkWinds [JBO94] and Dylan [DP95] use a drag-and-drop action from source window to destination window to establish the link. DEVise [LRB97], XGobi <ref> [BCS96] </ref>, and Logos use selection from lists. Those that implement multiple coordination options then use a dialog box to choose among the link types. LinkWinds draws lines between linked windows to visualize the links. Composite coordinations can be built by chaining several coordinations together.

Reference-contexts: Because of this lack of innovation, advantages of large screens and fast displays are lost or misused, leading to confusion, poor user performance, frustration, and missed opportunities. In designing user interfaces for information exploration, a strategy that has proven increasingly effective is multiple window coordination <ref> [Shn98] </ref>. In this strategy two or more separate windows containing related information are used cooperatively for the accomplishment of a single task. The windows respond in a unified manner to user activity in the task domain.

Reference-contexts: We also demonstrate these with mockups for browsing text documents (as in the above web example), and 2D and 3D data (as in the Visible Human Explorer [NSP96]). See [NWS86], [SSS86], [CPF84] for taxonomies of general multiple window strategies, and [CR96], <ref> [Twe97] </ref> for taxonomies of interaction in information visualization. TAXONOMY OF MULTIPLE WINDOW COORDINATIONS The taxonomy (Table 1) organizes coordination strategies into a 2x3 matrix. <p> With the LinkWinds system [JBO94], users can link control windows to visualization windows for dynamic filtering of scientific sensor data. The Attribute Explorer <ref> [Twe97] </ref> uses additive encoding of multiple attribute selections to highlight each item in a different color depending on the number of the selections it satisfies. B. Different information collections Brushing can be generalized to visualize not just equivalencies between same information collections, but also arbitrary relations between different collections.

Reference-contexts: Many data analysis systems (e.g. Spotfire [IVE97], XGobi [BCS96]) use this coordination to visualize high-dimensional data point sets with multiple coordinated 2D scatter plots ([MSB90] credits invention to C. Newton in 1978). These systems provide many options for selection method (single, cumulative, box, lasso, etc.) <ref> [Wil96] </ref> and highlight style (color, size, glyph, etc.). Visage [RLS96] generalizes this coordination, allowing users to drag-and-drop and then brush tabular data elements among many types of visualizations, including charts and geographical maps.
