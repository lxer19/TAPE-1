Title: Page 1 Requirements Specification for the Virgil Process Navigation and Enactment Tool Version  
Date: 5 August 1998  
Pubnum: 1.0  
Abstract-found: 0
Intro-found: 1
Reference: 1. <author> Fisher, G. </author> <title> The Inferno Educational Software Development Environment, </title> <type> Technical Report 98-2, </type> <institution> Department of Computer Science, Californa Polytechnic State University (1998). </institution>
Reference-contexts: In this way, the tool appropriate to a given phase of development is always launched. Virgil provides additional enactment-related facilities, including process completion status and other process management information. Virgil is designed to be a component of the Inferno software development environment <ref> [1] </ref>. When Virgil is integrated within Inferno, the development tools launched are those provided by Inferno, which are designed specifically for coordination with Vrigil facilities. Virgil may also be used independently from Inferno, launching external development tools.

Reference-contexts: In general, Virgil can be distinguished from other process-centered environments in to major areas: 1. the focus of Virgil on a pedagogical setting 2. the comprehensive graphical user interface available in Virgil Tw o recent systems worthy of specific mention are Endeavors [3] from U.C. Irvine and JIL <ref> [2] </ref> from the University of Colorado. Endeavors provides a graphical interface and other functionality similar to that of Virgil. However Endeavors is less focused on a pedagogical environment than is Virgil.

Reference-contexts: Page 3 1.4. Related Systems There a number of process-centered software development environments described in the computer science literature. Complete review of these systems is beyond the scope of this document at the present time. A good survey of process-centered SDEs is presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. In general, Virgil can be distinguished from other process-centered environments in to major areas: 1. the focus of Virgil on a pedagogical setting 2. the comprehensive graphical user interface available in Virgil Tw o recent systems worthy of specific mention are Endeavors [3] from U.C.
