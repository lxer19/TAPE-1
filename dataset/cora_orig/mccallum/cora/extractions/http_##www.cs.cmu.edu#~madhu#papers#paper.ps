Abstract: Open issues in the behavioral synthesis of electro-mechanical systems are: (1) developing convenient abstractions for physical principles,(2) dynamic variations of physical variables and (3) algorithms to facilitate synthesis of devices. Representations to facilitate these tasks have ranged from qualitative to quantitative schemes that have provided limited promise to support synthesis in a scalable, unambiguous manner. We outline essential requirements of a representation to facilitate composition of complex engineering systems from simpler components and present a case-based representation framework for design cases using the language of bond graphs. We present characteristics of the developed representation framework and illustrate the role of this formalism in the case-based behavioral design synthesis of mechatronic devices.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a systematic representation for composition of electro-mechanical devices from simpler subsystems based on behavioral specifications. We use bond graphs as a language to model design cases. Bond graphs <ref> [6, 7] </ref> view electro-mechanical device behavior from the standpoint of energy continuity and power balance. Systems and subsystems are classified both with respect to the number of energy ports through which energy is exchanged and also in terms of the particular internal power transformations involved.

Reference-contexts: In case-based design, indices for retrieval of systems, subsystems and components from the repository of previous designs are generated based on the design specifications of device input and output (i.e U (t) and Y (t)); the retrieved systems are combined using domain specific laws and physical principles and validated <ref> [13] </ref>. Design alternatives thus generated are presented to the user for perusal. A number of requirements need to be satisfied by the various elements of the systemic framework described above so that behavioral synthesis can be performed.

Reference-contexts: The synthesis task can be formulated as a combinatorial search problem since subsystems and primitives can be composed in numerous ways to meet a behavioral specification. The graph-based systemic model provides a convenient computational framework where systems can be composed algorithmically <ref> [19] </ref>. The creative aspect in the behavioral synthesis task is generating only feasible candidates from the numerous that are possible. <p> If the design specifications provide values and ranges for the effort and flow variables at the input and output ports, parametric design can be performed by searching for cases with satisfactory combination of values. For more details on bridging the conceptual and parametric design phases, see <ref> [19] </ref>. 6. Related device models in the literature In this Section, we present related approaches to modeling device behavior for purposes of behavioral synthesis of devices. Representations proposed in literature have tried to provide a qualitative abstraction and interpretation for the mathematical relations of physical effects.
