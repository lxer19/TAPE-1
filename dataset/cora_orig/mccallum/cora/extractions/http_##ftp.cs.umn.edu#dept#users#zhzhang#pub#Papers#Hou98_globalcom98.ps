Title: Network Bandwidth Sharing for Transporting Rate-Adaptive Packet Video Using Feedback  
Author: Y. Thomas Hou Shivendra S. Panwar Zhi-Li Zhang Henry Tzeng Ya-Qin Zhang k 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for network bandwidth sharing to transport rate-adaptive packet video using feedback. We show how a weight-based bandwidth sharing policy can be used to allocated network bandwidth among competing video connections and design a feedback control algorithm using the available bit rate (ABR) flow control mechanism. A novel video source rate adaptation algorithm is introduced to decouple a video source's actual transmission rate from the rate used for the protocol convergence. We also demonstrate how an on-line minimum rate renegotiation and weight adjustment mechanisms can be employed to further enhance the flexibility of our feedback control protocol.

A generic ABR flow control mechanism for a connection is shown in Fig. 1. Despite the somewhat complex specifications for ABR in [1], the basic idea for ABR is, in fact, quite simple. <p> Video Using an ABR-Like Mechanism The ABR mechanism allows a source end system to adjust its information transfer rate based on the bandwidth availability in the network <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: During the iteration process, after each time ` is updated, a connection previously belonging to M ` may be un marked and become a connection in U ` . It has been shown that eventually all connections in the network become conforming and satisfy our bandwidth sharing policy <ref> [2] </ref>. Simulation Results We use some simulation results to show the convergence property of our algorithm. For the networks in the simulation, all ATM switches are assumed to have output port buffering with sufficient internal switching capacity for the aggregate rates of all input ports.

Reference-contexts: Feedback control algorithms such as <ref> [3, 4, 6, 10] </ref> are unable to offer such rate decoupling property since a source's true transmission rate is used in ER calculation. We propose the following simple source rate adaptation algorithm for each video, which utilizes our unique rate decoupling property in our feedback control algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The ABR protocol has been recently shown to be a viable feedback control mechanism for transporting rate-adaptive video [6, 7, 11]. A key performance issue associated with using feedback to control video transmission is network bandwidth sharing among competing video connections. Prior efforts such as <ref> [5, 8, 9, 11] </ref> did not address this issue. In [6, 7], a MCR-proportional max-min policy was proposed to support rate-adaptive video. But it is not clear what a distributed feedback control algorithm should be employed to achieve such network bandwidth sharing policy.
