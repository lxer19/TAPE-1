Title: Probabilistic Algorithms for Efficient Grasping and Fixturing  
Author: Marek Teichmann Bud Mishra 
Abstract: Given an object with n points on its boundary where fingers can be placed, we give algorithms to select a "strong" grasp with a minimal number c of fingers (up to a logarithmic factor) for several measures of goodness. Along similar lines, given an integer c, we find the "best" c log c finger grasp for a small constant . We generalize existing measures for the case of frictionless assemblies of many objects in contact. We also give an approximation scheme which guarantees a grasp quality close to the overall optimal value where fingers are not restricted to preselected points. These problems translate into a collection of convex set covering problems where we either minimize the cover size or maximize the scaling factor of an inscribed geometric object L. We present an algorithmic framework which handles these problems in a uniform way and give approximation algorithms for specific instances of L including convex polytopes and balls. It generalizes an algorithm for polytope covering and approximation by Clarkson [Cla93] in two different directions. Let fl = 1=bd=2c. For both types of problems, when L is a polytope, we get the same expected time bounds (with a minor improvement), and for a ball, the expected running time is O(n 1+ffi + (nc) 1=(1+fl=(1+ffi)) + c log(n=c)(c log c) bd=2c ) for fixed d. We improve this bound if we allow in addition a different kind of approximation for the optimal radius. We also give bounds when d is not a constant.

Reference-contexts: This takes time O (jRj bd=2c ) for fixed d 4 (or O (jRj log jRj) 10 if d 3) [CS89, Cha93]. For variable d, we can use the algorithm in <ref> [AF92] </ref>, which finds f facets of the convex hull of n points in dimension d in time O (ndf ). As mentioned before, lemmas 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 apply when we replace the polytope L by a ball B (r), and this guarantees correctness of the algorithm. <p> cover for B (r) is: O n 1+ffi + (nc) 1=(1+fl=(1+ffi)) + c log (n=c)(c log c) bd=2c for fixed d, or O ncd log (n=c) + cd 2 2 d log (n=c)(4cd log c) bd=2c+1 for any d (and non-degenerate convex hull of the covers) using the result in <ref> [AF92] </ref> and the crude bound on the complexity of the convex hull of d2 d v b d 2 c . (This can be easily derived from the Upper Bound Theorem [MS71].) MinCover-P: The geometric object to be covered is a fixed polytope P with ` vertices containing the origin.

Reference-contexts: The previous framework generalizes to this case by essentially concatenating the force-torque vectors for each object and working in R 6k where k is the number of objects <ref> [BMK94] </ref>. Let m i be the center of mass of object i. In the following definitions 0 is the 6 dimensional zero vector. For each object B i and contact point p let i (p) = [n (p); (p m i ) fi n (p)]. <p> The application at hand will determine which measure will be used. 2 Related Results Exact algorithms for the problems mentioned in the previous section that run in polynomial time seem unlikely. In fact problems similar to these have been shown to be NP-hard <ref> [BMK94] </ref> or NP-complete [DJ90]. We therefore consider approximation algorithms for the MinCover and MaxScale problems. The MinCover-P problem arises in a dual form in the context of separating two nested polyhedra [MS92, Cla93].

Reference-contexts: If we ask for the smallest possible number of facets, this problem is NP-complete [DJ90]. Several approximation algorithms for this problem have been presented|both deterministic <ref> [DJ90, BG94] </ref>, and randomized [Cla93]. Consider U 0 as the intersection of a set of half-planes. In the above-mentioned algorithms, S 0 is found by eliminating facets (half-planes) from U 0 , while making sure that the new polytope is still contained in L. <p> It runs in time O (n d+1 ). There is also a deterministic analogue of Clarkson's algorithm which solves this problem and which provides a O (d log c)-approximation <ref> [BG94] </ref> in time O It is easy to verify that these hitting set techniques also apply to our MinCover-B problem as well as more general versions. <p> This fact does not use the geometry of the situation at all, and one wonders whether the size of the random sample could be reduced in our application where the points of U are in (non-strictly) convex position and lie on a "cylinder". The deterministic algorithm in <ref> [BG94] </ref> which uses "-nets reduces the approximation factor to O (1) for the three dimensional version of a closely related problem, see Section 2. Finally, to obtain a bound on the running time, we need to bound the number of iterations of the loop in find cover. <p> Finally, to obtain a bound on the running time, we need to bound the number of iterations of the loop in find cover. Again this lemma is a slight variation of Clarkson's and a similar lemma also appears in <ref> [BG94] </ref>. Lemma 3.3 The number of successful iterations of the loop in find cover before a cover is found is bounded from above by 2k 2k3 c lg (n=c), which is 4c lg (n=c) for k = 2, 1501c lg (n=c) for k = 1:501. Proof.

Reference-contexts: The entire algorithm runs in expected time O ncd log (n=c) + `c 2 d 3 log c log (n=c) + p For fixed d, we can also use linear programming queries using the recent batched version of Chan <ref> [Cha95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This can be done by computing the convex hull of R and finding a facet that is at a distance of less than r to the origin.

Reference-contexts: Let fl (c) be this maximum. In the approximation version, we ask for a d log c fl -approximation of the best cover C. In the sequel, we will replace L by various convex sets. We present an algorithmic framework derived from an algorithm by Clarkson <ref> [Cla93] </ref> for polytope covering that yields efficient randomized approximation algorithms for the above problems for various types of the set L. In fact, this approach works for any set L for which we can determine whether it lies entirely on one side of a query hyper-plane. <p> In fact problems similar to these have been shown to be NP-hard [BMK94] or NP-complete [DJ90]. We therefore consider approximation algorithms for the MinCover and MaxScale problems. The MinCover-P problem arises in a dual form in the context of separating two nested polyhedra <ref> [MS92, Cla93] </ref>. In this problem, we are given two polyhedra L 0 and U 0 with U 0 L 0 , and we want to find a separating polytope S 0 with U 0 S 0 L 0 with small number of facets. <p> If we ask for the smallest possible number of facets, this problem is NP-complete [DJ90]. Several approximation algorithms for this problem have been presented|both deterministic [DJ90, BG94], and randomized <ref> [Cla93] </ref>. Consider U 0 as the intersection of a set of half-planes. In the above-mentioned algorithms, S 0 is found by eliminating facets (half-planes) from U 0 , while making sure that the new polytope is still contained in L. <p> The correctness of the general algorithm follows from a series of lemmas. The following lemmas were shown in <ref> [Cla93] </ref> for L a convex polytope, but the proofs do not use the fact that L is polyhedral and actually apply to any set L. We state them here for completeness, and also to bound some constants explicitly. <p> We say that a facet F of a polytope P is visible from a point q if for every p 2 F , the segment pq does not meet P . Here P will be conv R. Following <ref> [Cla93] </ref>, we define an L-facet to be a facet visible from of point of L. Then we have the following lemma, which is a slightly modified version of Clarkson's lemma 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Another desirable characteristic of a grasp is that by varying these forces within certain limits, we can resist an arbitrary external force-torque or wrench of a certain magnitude. See for example [MNP90, MSS87] for a more detailed description. Other recent references on this topic include <ref> [Ngu87, FC92, PSS + 95, MLS94] </ref>. Most existing grasp synthesis algorithms either do not attempt to optimize the grasps found with respect to grasp strength, or do so for very specific situations such as small numbers of fingers, or planar objects. The algorithmic situation for fixturing assemblies is similar. <p> In the same time bound, we can solve the approximation version of MaxScale-P (with c an input parameter), and MinCover-P (with c the optimal cover size.) 1.3 Further applications. Other efficiency measures closely related to the previous one have been proposed, see for example <ref> [FC92] </ref> for a measure based on Minkowski sums instead of convex hulls. Yet another measure was proposed by W. Meyer and was described in [Mis94] see this paper for a survey of grasp efficiency measures.

Reference-contexts: For polyhedral objects there are linear time algorithms to find such a closure grasp. However there is no guarantee on the "quality" of the grasp. In <ref> [KMY92] </ref> such a measure of efficiency is proposed. It measures the amount of external force and torque that can be resisted by applying at most a unit force distributed among the grasp points. <p> Note that it cannot be greater than r ((@B)). It is also of interest (see section 1.3) to replace the ball by a certain convex polytope. We would like to obtain grasps of high efficiency but with few fingers. These are two conflicting goals <ref> [KMY92] </ref>, so in this paper we provide algorithms for optimizing one quantity or the other. 1.2 Optimization problems. At this point let us describe the setting for the optimization algorithms in full generality. Let () be some grasp efficiency measure, generalized to higher dimension (see below). <p> It would be interesting to analyze these changes. For the MaxScale-B problem, Kirkpatrick et al. <ref> [KMY92] </ref> give an algorithm that finds a cover 7 C of size c containing a ball of radius r (C) = 1 3d 2d 2 =c for n c 13 d d (d+3)=2 in time O (LP (n; d)c). The radius found is almost optimal for that cover size. <p> We sample conv R by performing the ray shooting queries described above for the case of polytopes, along equally distributed rays on the set of directions (or points on a sphere.) We can use the upper bound construction of <ref> [KMY92] </ref> to find such a set of points or rays.

Reference-contexts: Fixture elements or fixels are positioned in contact with the objects to achieve this. Often there is only a finite set of possible placements due to the construction of the workholding table <ref> [Mis91, ZGW94] </ref>. In this setting, forces applied to an object are due both to contacts between objects, and between objects and fixtures. As in grasping, it is desirable to use a small number of fixtures, and/or limit the forces they must apply on the objects.

Reference-contexts: Fixture elements or fixels are positioned in contact with the objects to achieve this. Often there is only a finite set of possible placements due to the construction of the workholding table <ref> [Mis91, ZGW94] </ref>. In this setting, forces applied to an object are due both to contacts between objects, and between objects and fixtures. As in grasping, it is desirable to use a small number of fixtures, and/or limit the forces they must apply on the objects.
