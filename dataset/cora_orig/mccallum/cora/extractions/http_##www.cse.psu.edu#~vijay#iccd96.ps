Abstract: In this paper, we describe the concept of dynamic frequency clocking and the design of a linear VLSI array processor, DFLAP, for use in image processing applications. Dynamic frequency clocking enables the chip to operate at different frequencies switching dynamically depending on the instruction being executed. Such a technique facilitates better management of throughput and power requirements in a VLSI system. The applicability of dynamic clocking in pipelined systems is also investigated. The effectiveness of the dynamic frequency architecture is illustrated by mapping several tasks for image processing applications.

Reference-contexts: It is vital to identify new architectural attributes to enhance the performance, as demand for performance increases while the technology is pushed to its limits. Several special purpose parallel image processing machines such as SIBA, MGAP, SCL Warp have been proposed and built <ref> [2] </ref>. These machines differ in their architecture, interconnection, granularity and technology depending when the machine was built. In this paper, we propose a new parallel VLSI architecture,DFLAP, which uses a novel concept of dynamic frequency clocking. Dynamic frequency selection is especially suitable for image processing algorithms. <p> CLOCK MASTER CLOCK FUNCTION ENABLE FLAGS ADDER SHIFTER SRAM LOGIC MULTIPLIER NEIGHBOR COMMUNI CATION 400 MHz 400 MHz200 MHz 200 MHz 50 MHz100 MHz CLK3 CLK4CLK2CLK1 Pass Logic Two (T-FF) Pass Logic Divide by Two Two Divide by Pass Logic Divide by Encoder Enable Encoder Instruction MUX I/P Clock E <ref> [2] </ref> E [1] E [0] S [1:0] Instruction Word Clock O/P For instance, a particular instruction class, encoded as S [1:0] = 10 by the instruction encoder, has an operating frequency of 100MHz associated with it. <p> Each PE is capable of operating on one microinstruction every clock cycle.

Reference-contexts: Here P A and P B is the performance measure of a system with dynamic clocking and without dynamic clocking. We can use optimization techniques <ref> [4] </ref> like Lagrange multiplier to solve this formulation. The proposed design is based on a single clock cycle operation for all units and the same architecture can be easily extended for the pipelined design requiring different frequencies. 4.
