Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (dags) are often used to model circuits. Path lengths in such dags represent circuit delays. In the vertex splitting problem, the objective is to determine a minimum number of vertices to split so that the resulting dag has no path of length d. This problem has application to the placement of flip-flops in partial scan designs, placement of latches in pipelined circuits, placement of signal boosters in lossy circuits and networks, etc. Several simplified versions of this problem are shown to be NP-hard. A linear time algorithm is obtained for the case when the dag is a tree. A backtracking algorithm and heuristics are developed for general dags and experimental results using dags obtained from ISCAS benchmark circuits are obtained.

Reference-contexts: The S-graphs were first rendered cycle free by the procedure given in [LEE90]. The characteristics of the resulting dags are given in Table 1.

Associated with each edge is the propagation delay along the corresponding circuit gate input. <p> Associated with each edge is the propagation delay along the corresponding circuit gate input. The edge delay was set to the maximum of the rising and falling delays provided in <ref> [BRGL85] </ref>. The characteristics of these circuits are given in Table 2. For each dag, G, we experimented with the d values - .9d (G), .8d (G), .7d (G), .6d (G), .5d (G), .4d (G) -. Table 3 gives the results for the case G = s400.

Reference-contexts: Experimental Results The backtracking algorithm of Section 5 and the four heuristics of Section 6 were programmed in Pascal and run on an Apollo DN3500 workstation. We experimented with two sets of acyclic directed graphs. The first set was obtained from the S-graphs of the ISCAS-89 benchmark sequential circuits <ref> [BRGL89] </ref>. The S-graphs were first rendered cycle free by the procedure given in [LEE90]. The characteristics of the resulting dags are given in Table 1. The other set of graphs was derived from the ISCAS-85 benchmark combinational circuits [BRGL85].

Reference-contexts: For such situations, partial-scan designs have been proposed. In partial-scan designs only a selected subset of the flip-flops in a sequential circuit are included in the scan-path. Several methods to choose the flip-flops to be included in the scan-path have been proposed <ref> [CHEN90] </ref>, [GUPT90], [LEE90]. One of these proposals gives a method to use the structural information in a sequential circuit to determine the flip-flops to be placed in a scan-path [CHEN90]. We briefly discuss this method.

A sequential circuit is represented by a directed graph (digraph) called S-graph. Each flip-flop in a sequential circuit is represented by a node in the S-graph. <p> Figure 1 is an example of a S-graph. Empirical evidence suggests that the existence of cycles and the maximum path length between nodes of the S-graph increase the complexity of deriving tests for sequential circuits. It was therefore suggested in <ref> [CHEN90] </ref> to include a minimum subset of flip-flops into a scan-path such that the resulting S-graph is cycle-free and the maximum distance between a pair of nodes is small. There are several cycles in the S-graph of Figure 1. <p> In this the maximum distance between any pair of nodes is less than or equal to 3. - 3 - 4 1 2 o 6 5 3 5 i 2 o 6 3 - 4 - Two step methods to select the flip-flops to be scanned were proposed in <ref> [CHEN90] </ref>, [GUPT90], and [LEE90]. In the first step a minimal subset of flip-flops is selected to be included in the scan-path such that the resulting S-graph is acyclic.

Reference-contexts: Tree DVSP In this section we develop a linear time algorithm for the DVSP when the wdag G is a rooted tree. The algorithm is a simple postorder <ref> [HORO90] </ref> traversal of the tree. During this traversal we compute, for each node x, the maximum delay, D (x), from x to any other node in its subtree.
