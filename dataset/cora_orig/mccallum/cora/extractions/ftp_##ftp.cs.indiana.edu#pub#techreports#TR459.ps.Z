Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which users were given the task of reading and searching text files with both a paging viewer and a "magnifying" viewer which allows the entire file to fit on a single screen, with a bar of magnification which can be used to make portions readable. A comparison is made between the two different viewers on two different types of text layout, one highly structured, and the other with little structure. Results indicate a suitability for using the magnifying browser on structured text.

Reference-contexts: If all lines are aligned by their leftmost character, then the right-hand edges will no longer line up, and in the case of textual tables the entries may also not line up. An alternative is to use a method such as the one described by Ball and Eick <ref> [1] </ref>, where lines of text in "demagnified" areas are rendered as simple lines having appropriate indentation. 2.3 User Interaction In the magnifying interface, subjects could use the mouse or the keyboard for navigation. Use of the keyboard was limited to the up and down arrow keys. <p> Their system does not cause the text to overlap, however the discrete font sizes used for the text representation also do not allow a guarantee that an entire text file will fit in a single window. Ball and Eick <ref> [1] </ref> have worked on using smaller line and pixel representations of text to enable more of a source code file to be "seen" on a single screen. With discrete resolution levels, detail is not smoothly integrated into the context however, and is instead displayed in separate windows or neighboring areas.

Reference-contexts: Variable font sizing systems such as the one discussed in <ref> [5] </ref> present some potential problems: * For fast rendering, bit-mapped fonts are generally preferred. <p> Although it is still an open question whether further improvements to the interface would change this finding, this study suggests that the advantages of the magnifying interface are intrinsically tied to the "landmarks" which are present in the global view of more structured texts. 6 Related Work Greenberg and Gutwin <ref> [5] </ref> have developed a groupware text editor using fisheye views (with multiple focus points) to provide global context of text files. <p> Such functionality has been implemented for our browser, but has yet to be subjected to user studies. In addition, piecewise linear transformations [6] can be used to produce more arbitrary magnification transformations, similar to the customizable "fisheye lens" described in Greenberg and Gutwin <ref> [5] </ref>. Piecewise linear functions also offer the intriguing possibility of constructing magnification transformations based on the content of text files. For example, an HTML viewer might magnify header lines, and suppress details in listed data until they are magnified by the user.

Reference-contexts: The non-linear magnification used for this system involves a transformation on the y coordinate only, using a narrow rectangle the width of the screen to constrain the domain of magnification (details for how to implement this transformation are described in <ref> [6] </ref>). 2.1 Magnification Transformation The magnification transformation produces vertical coordinates which are used to position each line of text, however no magnification of the actual text occurs in this system, only the spatial separation between lines is changed. <p> Such functionality has been implemented for our browser, but has yet to be subjected to user studies. In addition, piecewise linear transformations <ref> [6] </ref> can be used to produce more arbitrary magnification transformations, similar to the customizable "fisheye lens" described in Greenberg and Gutwin [5].

Reference-contexts: With discrete resolution levels, detail is not smoothly integrated into the context however, and is instead displayed in separate windows or neighboring areas. Mackinlay, Robertson and Cards' "Perspective Wall" <ref> [8] </ref> describes a technique for providing limited context for text viewing, but does not provide the global file view described here. 7 Further Work Multiple bars of magnification can allow for more than one area of the text to be viewed at once.
