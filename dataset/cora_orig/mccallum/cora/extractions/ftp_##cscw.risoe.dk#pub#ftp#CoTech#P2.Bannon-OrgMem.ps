Abstract: This paper provides a critique of current conceptions of "organizational memory" as presented in a number of recent studies. It briefly reviews some of the rich and varied contributions from both administrative studies and information systems concerning this topic, while at the same time noting the vagueness of the term as it is commonly used. What is of interest is the pervasiveness and perseverance of this nebulous concept across a wide range of disciplinary endeavors. The paper provides an important reformulation of one aspect of memory that is implicit if not explicit in most current views, i.e. the notion of memory as a passive store, arguing instead for an active, constructive view of "remembering" that has a long, if forgotten history within psychology and other fields. In the final section, some implications of such an approach are discussed, paying particular attention to the need for empirical studies of "memories in use" and the need to focus on the active construction of common information spaces from information repositories, and expanding the domain of discourse to include sociological as well as psychological perspectives on concepts such as memory, learning, remembering, talking, etc. in the context of organizations. This reformulation of the issues surrounding organizational memory has significant implications for the kinds of computer "support" for this phenomenon which might be possible or feasible, which can only be touched on in this paper, but will be extended in future work.

This work of Doug Engelbart and his group has had, and indeed is still having, a profound impact on the development of interactive computing and our interfaces to computers (Bannon, 1989; Engelbart, 1988b).

This represents a rather standard view of the human as the fallible element in the system, and the possibility of supplementing or even replacing the human element with computers.

Reference-contexts: An active community would be constantly involved in dialogue concerning the contents of its handbook. Constant updating would provide a certified community position structure about which the real evolutionary work would swarm. As noted elsewhere <ref> (Schmidt & Bannon, 1992) </ref> the notion of a uniform, complete, consistent, up-to-date integration of the community knowledge is hardly realistic. Interpretative work remains to be done by the actors accessing the community handbook. <p> without shared meaning, since a memory that is neither accessible nor understandable can hardly be called sharable.(Konda, et al., 1992) This view is strikingly reminiscent of comments made in another paper, concerning the notion of a shared information space (Bannon & Schmidt, 1991) or more recently, a common information space <ref> (Schmidt & Bannon, 1992) </ref>: A common information space encompasses the artefacts that are accessible to a cooperative ensemble as well as the meaning attributed to these artefacts by the actors.

In the former case, in a commercial software development project over an extended period, the authors claim that the method was an improvement over unstructured notes and had several beneficial side effects.

Reference-contexts: Also, there is work in engineering design concerning shared memory (Konda, Monarch, Sargent, & Subrahmanian, 1992), while others have tried to develop systems to support the software development process through maintaining a design rationale (Conklin & Begemen, 1988) or a design knowledge base <ref> (Terveen, Selfridge, & Long, 1993) </ref> or more general systems support (Ackerman, 1994b) and organizational support (Fuchs & Prinz, 1993). Let us now briefly characterize some of the contributions at the level of systems before we go further into our analysis of the concept. <p> A recent paper by software developers at AT&T Bell Labs provides an interesting and thoughtful discussion of issues surrounding the concept of an organizational memory as well as a description of the development and use of a prototype system to serve as a living design memory <ref> (Terveen, et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Given the shortage of space in this paper, this is not the place to provide an exhaustive or even extensive reference to the evolving literature on the theme. Rather, we will refer to a recent major review paper on the topic <ref> (Walsh & Ungson, 1991) </ref> which collates much of the early material and provides a useful context for our subsequent remarks. <p> So are copies of letters, spreadsheet data stored in computers, and the latest strategic plan, as well as what is in the minds of all organizational members" (Kim, 1993). One of the best known and widely cited conceptions of organizational memory is presented by Walsh and Ungson <ref> (Walsh & Ungson, 1991) </ref>. In their review paper Walsh and Ungson develop a model of the structure of organizational memory from the administrative science point of view that synthesizes a large number of previously presented conceptions.

Reference-contexts: Wynn (1979) notes "In an office as it presently operates, the knowledge which is both means and product is dependent on interaction between people for its quality, relevance and appropriateness. These interactions are in turn dependent on social practices" <ref> (Wynn, 1979) </ref> pg. 165. More recently, Blacker notes: "Talk about computer-mediated information and the transformation of isolated problem-solving attempts into a shared activity are crucial to the effective operation of the "informated" organization. It is only through such processes that the process of collective interpretation can be reached."(Blackler, 1994), p.12.

Reference-contexts: The intent was that this system would help groups to capture the design rationale of their projects in the course of actually making the design. Experiences of the use of this system in groups are reported in <ref> (Yakemovic & Conklin, 1990) </ref>, and in (Selvin, 1994). In the former case, in a commercial software development project over an extended period, the authors claim that the method was an improvement over unstructured notes and had several beneficial side effects.

Reference-contexts: The material that does bear on such issues is often developed by people from outside this community. For example, the work of JoAnne Yates on the history of managerial control and communication mechanisms in American organizations <ref> (Yates, 1989) </ref> provides a rich historical analysis of material of relevance here.
