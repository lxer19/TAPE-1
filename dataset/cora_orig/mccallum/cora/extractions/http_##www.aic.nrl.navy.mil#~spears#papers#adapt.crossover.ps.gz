Title: Adapting Crossover in a Genetic Algorithm  
Author: William M. Spears 
Keyword: Genetic algorithm theory, recombination operators, adaptation  
Address: Washington, D.C. 20375 USA  
Affiliation: Naval Research Laboratory  
Abstract: Traditionally, genetic algorithms have relied upon 1 and 2-point crossover operators. Many recent empirical studies, however, have shown the benefits of higher numbers of crossover points. Some of the most intriguing recent work has focused on uniform crossover, which involves on the average L/2 crossover points for strings of length L. Despite theoretical analysis, however, it appears difficult to predict when a particular crossover form will be optimal for a given problem. This paper describes an adaptive genetic algorithm that decides, as it runs, which form is optimal.
