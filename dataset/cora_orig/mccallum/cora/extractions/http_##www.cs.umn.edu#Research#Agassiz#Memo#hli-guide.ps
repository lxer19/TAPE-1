Reference-contexts: For the portability purpose, HLI resides in separate data structures from those used in the back-end compiler, and the information is retrieved only by a set of query functions specified in <ref> [1] </ref>. The query functions stand as a common interface to HLI regardless of the back-end compiler used. The implementation of the query functions, however, are in some parts dependent on the internals of the back-end compiler. <p> It simply create equivalent class in reg and reg's parents and also link them with parent-child relation. It returns the equivalent class in reg. This is a basis for several high-level jobs. 4 Query Functions For the prototypes and semantics of the query functions, refer to <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> From the given instruction, get an item. 2. From the item, get the line structure. 3. Follow a pointer to reach at the parent line structure. 4. Return needed information. 8 5 Maintenance Functions For the prototypes and semantics of the maintenance functions, refer to <ref> [1] </ref>. This section focuses on the algorithms used to implement the maintenance functions. A return value (5.1 ??) equal to or larger than 0 means the job was done correctly, otherwise something went wrong.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction High-Level Information (or HLI) <ref> [2] </ref> has been proposed to provide a number of important program information that is not available or hard to calculate in back-end compilers.
