Abstract: Consider a group of Bayesians, each with a subjective probability distribution over a set of uncertain events. An opinion pool derives a single consensus distribution over the events, representative of the group as a whole. Several pooling functions have been proposed, each sensible under particular assumptions or measures. Many researchers over many years have failed to form a consensus on which method is best. We propose a market-based pooling procedure, and analyze its properties. Participants bet on securities, each paying off contingent on an uncertain event, so as to maximize their own expected utilities. The consensus probability of each event is defined as the corresponding security's equilibrium price. The market framework provides explicit monetary incentives for participation and honesty, and allows agents to maintain individual rationality and limited privacy. "No arbitrage" arguments ensure that the equilibrium prices form legal probabilities. We show that, when events are disjoint and all participants have exponential utility for money, the market derives the same result as the logarithmic opinion pool; similarly, logarithmic utility for money yields the linear opinion pool. In both cases, we prove that the group's behavior is, to an outside observer, indistinguishable from that of a rational individual, whose beliefs equal the equilibrium prices.

Reference-contexts: The debate over which aggregation method is best continues to rage [Benediktsson and Swain, 1992, Cooke, 1991, French, 1985, Genest and Zidek, 1986]. Several authors (most emphatically Lindley [1985]) argue that, when possible, the supra Bayesian approach is best, as it is grounded in standard normative Bayesian theory <ref> [Clemen and Winkler, 1993, Morris, 1977, Winkler, 1981] </ref>. However, several conceptual questions arise in characterizing the single supra Bayesian responsible for the consensus of a (possibly leaderless) group [Genest and Zidek, 1986]. <p> In almost every treatment of this method strong assumptions are made for the supra Bayesian's priors and likelihood function|for example, by assuming that the members' beliefs are normally distributed and independent|in order to yield tractable results <ref> [Clemen and Winkler, 1993, Jacobs, 1995, Lindley, 1985, Winkler, 1981] </ref>. Weighted aggregation functions are not without their own drawbacks. Each method implies different properties for the combined distribution.

Reference-contexts: We take instead a bottom-up approach, beginning with characterizations of individual behavior, and deriving the implications for aggregate properties from there. One of the most convincing justifications for individual subjective probabilities is de Finetti's famous "no Dutch book" argument <ref> [de Finetti, 1974] </ref>. Imagine that a bettor ("he") must decide at what price to buy and sell each of two lottery tickets: one pays $1 if A occurs, and nothing otherwise; the other pays $1 if B.

Much debate revolves around which properties of the aggregate distribution are "reasonable", and which pooling functions exhibit them.

Reference-contexts: More generally, if the bettor's internal prices for a set of such lottery tickets are not legal probabilities, then he is exposed to sure losses|also called Dutch books or 2 arbitrage <ref> [Varian, 1987] </ref>. Now imagine a group of bettors locked in a room. The shrewd opponent is outside, and slides offers to buy and sell lottery tickets under the door. She does not care who accepts her offers: if opportunities for risk-free profit exist, she will take advantage of them.

Reference-contexts: Forming consensus beliefs is a classic problem in statistics [Degroot, 1974, French, 1985, Genest and Zidek, 1986, Lindley, 1985, West, 1984, West and Crosse, 1992a, West and Crosse, 1992b], and has found application in many areas, from group decision making <ref> [Morris, 1974, Weerahandi and Zidek, 1981, Zidek, 1988] </ref> to artificial intelligence [Jacobs, 1995, Ng and Abramson, 1994, Pennock and Wellman, 1996, Pennock and Wellman, 1997].

Reference-contexts: Another point of contention is how best to determine the expert weights. In most cases they are chosen in an ad hoc manner to encode some measure of confidence, reliability, or importance <ref> [Benediktsson and Swain, 1992, French, 1985, Winkler, 1968] </ref>. Some more formal methods to derive weights have been proposed, by making assumptions concerning the form of, or interdependence between, participants' beliefs [Cooke, 1991, Degroot and Mortera, 1991, Jacobs, 1995, Morris, 1977], or through iterative self-weighting procedures [Degroot, 1974].

Reference-contexts: The debate over which aggregation method is best continues to rage [Benediktsson and Swain, 1992, Cooke, 1991, French, 1985, Genest and Zidek, 1986]. Several authors (most emphatically Lindley [1985]) argue that, when possible, the supra Bayesian approach is best, as it is grounded in standard normative Bayesian theory <ref> [Clemen and Winkler, 1993, Morris, 1977, Winkler, 1981] </ref>. However, several conceptual questions arise in characterizing the single supra Bayesian responsible for the consensus of a (possibly leaderless) group [Genest and Zidek, 1986]. <p> In almost every treatment of this method strong assumptions are made for the supra Bayesian's priors and likelihood function|for example, by assuming that the members' beliefs are normally distributed and independent|in order to yield tractable results <ref> [Clemen and Winkler, 1993, Jacobs, 1995, Lindley, 1985, Winkler, 1981] </ref>. Weighted aggregation functions are not without their own drawbacks. Each method implies different properties for the combined distribution.

A natural practical application for pooling opinions is as a sub-procedure within the more general context of group decision making, where agents' beliefs and utilities are combined to enable inference of optimal group decisions.
