Abstract: 1 This article describes the "Bootstrapping Strategy," a particular strategic approach for guiding and accelerating the coevolution of human tools, skills, and knowledge to afford maximum leverage in this extraordinary augmentation effort. A primary ingredient of the Bootstrapping Strategy is the deliberate collaboration among carefully selected pilot projects, across organizational boundaries. This strategy is best illustrated by focusing on the heart of any collaborative effort: the process by which it evolves its knowledge base, which is called the "Handbook Cycle." Requirements for technologies, methodologies, explicit organizational roles, and industry standards are addressed in this article. 1a In engineering, the term "bootstrapping" describes the process wherein the results of a given effort are fed back into the activity in a reinforcing way, so that less internal energy is required to achieve bigger results faster. In life, this process is "lifting oneself up by one's bootstraps." 2a1 Consider the investment leverage achievable by applying this model to augmenting organizational capabilities, that is, by simultaneously boosting the knowledge-work capability and the evolutionary capability of organizations. This leveraged, dual-result approach is called a "Bootstrapping Strategy" (Engelbart, 1988a). 2a2 How do we best employ the Bootstrapping Strategy to our goal of markedly boosting organizational capabilities? The model proposed here involves a three-tiered support structure of organizations and their evolutionary "improvement
