Title: Time-of-Flight Technique to Search for Non-Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles

Abstract: We discuss the application of the time-of-flight (TOF) technique to a search for non-relativistic supermassive electrically or strongly interacting particles. Accidental coincidences are the primary background in such a search at balloon altitude. If we employ four scintillation counters, and measure 10 m s time delays to a precision better than 10 ns, then the TOF method can reject accidental coincidences for particles depositing more than 0.4 MeV cm 2 /g in a typical balloon detector configuration.
