Title: A Parallel Implementation of the Block-GTH algorithm  
Author: Yuan-Jye Jason Wu 
Date: September 2, 1994  
Abstract: The GTH algorithm is a very accurate direct method for finding the stationary distribution of a finite-state, discrete time, irreducible Markov chain. O'Leary and Wu developed the block-GTH algorithm and successfully demonstrated the efficiency of the algorithm on vector pipeline machines and on workstations with cache memory. In this paper, we discuss the parallel implementation of the block-GTH algorithm and show effective performance on the CM-5.
