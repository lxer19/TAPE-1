Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that these approaches differ significantly regarding the commitment made to the design of each one's particular fundamental unit of intelligence. Representative examples include the multi-level hierarchical approach espoused by Albus in his Theory of Intelligence <ref> [1] </ref>, Meystel's recursive formalisms based on hierarchical organization principles [14], and Brooks' subsumption architecture [8].

Reference-contexts: Often these architectures include aspects of both deliberative and reactive control and are often broken into two, three, or more qualitatively different levels. Representational examples of these "accretional architectures" include Arkin's AuRA system <ref> [2] </ref>, Gat's Atlantis [13], and Firby's RAPS [11], among others. Here no commitment is made to a particular processing paradigm that is to be considered uniform throughout intelligence. A partition of functionality is made based on a robotic agent's particular needs at a given time.

Reference-contexts: We have, for example, the basic TM with a single head and tape with the ability to move left or right one cell. Hopcroft and Ullman describe techniques for the construction of more sophisticated Turing Machines <ref> [12] </ref> which are equivalent in a theoretical sense yet have certain advantages for specific proofs. These include multi-tape TMs, two-way infinite tape TMs, nondeterministic Turing machines, multidimensional Turing machines, multihead Turing machines, off-line Turing machines, multistack machines, and counter machines. Seemingly a lot of different architectures for a simple concept.

Reference-contexts: Unified field theories, in general, are notoriously hard to establish. 4 Finally, Niche Finding McFarland's concept of ecological niches <ref> [15] </ref> is particularly relevant to the question of appropriate architectural design. This view promulgates that robotic systems must find their place within the world as competitors with other ecological counterparts (e.g., people). The issues regarding robotic system cost also serve as important driving factors.
