Abstract: This paper gives a brief history of the development of an approach to helping students learn mathematical concepts at the post-secondary level. The method uses ISETL, a programming language derived from SETL, to implement instruction whose design is based on an emerging theory of learning. Examples are given of uses of this pedagogical strategy in abstract algebra, calculus, and mathematical induction.

Reference-contexts: Learning the syntax for procedures in SETL (and later, funcs in ISETL) and using these programming structures to represent specific functions visibly enrichened students' repertoires of examples of functions. (See <ref> [1] </ref> for some details.) Moving over to (finite) sets of ordered pairs and learning the syntax for evaluating a function | which is identical to the syntax for functions defined as procedures | led to students beginning to develop understandings of functions that went beyond what most people see when teaching <p> Research suggests that this can make a difference <ref> [1] </ref>. Finally we might mention the example of proposition-valued function of the positive integers. Our research suggests that one of the difficulties students have with proof by induction is at the very beginning.

Reference-contexts: There was less concern with speed and one heard it said about a complex SETL program that, "If it moves, it's fast enough." Later, there was some concern with efficiency and the Data Representational Sublanguage <ref> [2] </ref> was designed to help make programs written in SETL run faster and more efficiently. The initial reactions of students who used SETL in the first courses was that it helped considerably.

Reference-contexts: Lines without these prompts are what the computer prints on the screen. &gt; 7+18; &gt; 13*(233.8); &gt; 5 = 2.0 + 3; true; &gt; 4 &gt;= 2 + 3; false; 13 &gt; 17 &gt; *2; -5.1300e+001; &gt; x; &gt; 27/36; &gt; p := [3,-2]; q := [1,4.5]; r := [0.5,-2,-3]; <ref> [3, -2] </ref>; [5.00000e-001, -2, -3]; -2; -3; -6.00000e+000; &gt; length := 0; &gt; for i in [1..3] do &gt; length := length + r (i)**2; &gt; end; &gt; length := sqrt (length); &gt; length; 3.64005e+000; Students are asked to do these exercises for the purpose of becoming familiar with the syntax <p> Finally, the algorithm for computing the length of a vector in three dimensions appears as an action because the calculation is explicit and is applied to a single vector.

Reference-contexts: Then the reconstruction is not exactly the same as what existed previously, and may in fact contain one or more advances to a more sophisticated level. This whole notion is related to the well known Piagetian dichotomy of assimilation and acco-modation <ref> [5] </ref>. Finally, the question arises of what is constructed, or what is the nature of the constructions and the ways in which they are made? It is when we talk about this that our theoretical perspective, which may appear applicable to any subject whatsoever, becomes specific to mathematics.

Reference-contexts: In general, encapsulating processes to become objects is considered to be extremely difficult <ref> [6] </ref> and not very many pedagogical strategies have been effective in helping students do this in situations such as functions or cosets. A part of the reason is that there is very little in our experience that corresponds to performing actions on what are interpreted as processes. Schema.

Reference-contexts: It is a controversial point, but this theory takes the position that reflection is best performed in a social context. There is evidence in the literature (see <ref> [7] </ref>, for example) for the value to students of social interaction and there is also the cultural fact that almost all research mathematicians feel very strongly the need for interactions with colleagues before, during, and after creative work in mathematics.
