Abstract: In this paper, we focus on some of the scientific data management problems faced by the Human Genome Project. In particular, we describe the design of an information model for the physical contig map assembly task. First, we present an object-oriented data schema that captures genomic data and their relationships required for this task, including the raw experimental data and the derived data gotten through analysis. Our genome object representation efficiently supports the maintenance of unordered, partially ordered, and completely ordered sets of data based on an overlap refinement hierarchy of interval relationships. We describe operators we have developed to automate analysis steps currently performed manually by the scientists. Examples are operators for inverting local orientation frames, for combining information in different frames into another more informative one, and for inferring additional overlap information using transitivity rules. In conclusion, we provide a walk-through example that demonstrates how our approach can be used to effectively support some of the experiments currently performed by the scientists at the Michigan Human Genome Center. fl The authors are grateful to acknowledge partial financial support from the NIH under grant NIH #P30HG00209-03.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we find the work in the temporal reasoning domain relevant to our project. Temporal reasoning deals with events and relationships between events. Allen <ref> [1] </ref> lists all possible relationships between temporal intervals assuming complete information about their endpoint relationships, and presents a transitivity table for these relationships. There are two major differences between the temporal domain and the genome domain. Firstly, in the temporal domain there is a simple global orientation. <p> We have developed an abstraction hierarchy of ordering relationships for the genomic domain which accounts for these characteristics. Letovsky and Berlyn [12] use local ordering windows to represent such relative orderings. Their work deals only with points rather than intervals. We combine the "interval" idea <ref> [1] </ref> and the "window" idea [12] to solve the DNA fragment ordering problem. 3 THE OBJECT MODEL FOR MAP ASSEMBLY Traditional databases do not capture well the complexity of scientific data; therefore we propose to design a genome object model using OODB technology [8]. <p> Prior work in ordering of intervals has focused on temporal ordering <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. While some concepts from temporal ordering can apply to DNA fragment ordering, there are several significant differences: * First, the determination of the equality of endpoint relationships between DNA fragments is generally too costly.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The human genome project is an international 15-year effort to map all the genes in the human genome. The physical mapping process <ref> [2] </ref> is to identify features of the DNA fragments and determine the locations of these features on a chromosome by ordering the fragments to their respective locations on the chromosomes. The scope and complexity of the Human Genome Project is such that previously acceptable manual methods are no longer suitable.

Reference-contexts: Our model is developed using object-oriented database (OODB) technology <ref> [3] </ref> since the latter provides powerful modeling constructs for capturing such complex genomic information naturally and efficiently. We are interested in creating a contig map, assembling overlapping DNA fragments into a contiguous stretch.

Reference-contexts: modeling complex genomic data and their interrelationships, its computational completeness allowing us to directly operate on the persistent data structures and thus avoiding the impedance mismatch problem, and lastly its support for genome objects to play different roles in the database and to be modeled at varying levels of details <ref> [10] </ref>. In order to support the full range of capabilities required by the Human Genome Project, there are many areas that need to be further investigated. For instance, we need to extend our current information model, which supports partial knowledge about ordering, to also handle inaccurate and conflicting experimental data.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 gives an overview of the system architecture, Section 7 goes through a comprehensive example, and Section 8 discusses conclusions and future work. Due to space limitation, the background material and some of our contributions are only briefly discussed. We refer the reader to <ref> [11] </ref> for a more complete explanation. 2 RELATED WORK In this paper, we view both DNA fragments and probes (see Section 3) as intervals, which have neither precise location information nor known distal extent. Thus, we find the work in the temporal reasoning domain relevant to our project. <p> Full details on the meaning of the relationships can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. The key features of this abstraction hierarchy can be summarized as follows: * The representation supports both precise as well as partial information about interval relationships. The hierarchy naturally describes the amount of knowledge we know about the endpoint relationships of the two intervals. <p> The inverse of each relationship can be determined (1) by inverting the arguments of the relationship (e.g., from (A,B) to (B,A)) and (2) by replacing the relationship by its inverses (e.g., replace ND&lt; by ND&gt;). For a complete listing of mirror image construction see <ref> [11] </ref>. 4.3 Supporting Evidence We further extend our model by characterizing the in terval relationships in terms of the evidence of exper imental data used to deduce them. <p> Unfortunately, there appears to be no generic rule that covers all cases, as for the LOF composition rules. Rather, a different formula must be developed for each transitivity rule, i.e., for each entry in the transitivity table in Appendix B (see <ref> [11] </ref> for further details). Example 3 The evidence-composition formula for the example depicted in Figure 9, i.e., the transitivity rule disjoint (A,C) := disjoint (A,B) ffi 3 not-contained-2 (B,C) is evidence (disjoint (A,C)) = [ S 11 , S 12 [ S 21 , S 23 ]. <p> P1,P2 g, fP 3g, f P4 g ] 4 [ fP 5g, fg, fP 6g ] = [ f P1,P2 g [ fg, f P3 g [ 3 ffi denotes the operator of the transitivity rule given in Appendix B. 4 denotes the operator of the evidence-combination rule given in <ref> [11] </ref>. Finally, we can establish the following rule for deriving point to point and point to interval relationships from interval relationships which have been annotated by evidence.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we may determine that two intervals overlap, but not whether their left endpoints are identical. We have developed an abstraction hierarchy of ordering relationships for the genomic domain which accounts for these characteristics. Letovsky and Berlyn <ref> [12] </ref> use local ordering windows to represent such relative orderings. Their work deals only with points rather than intervals.

We express an ordering relationship between two DNA fragments as a pairwise constraint between fragments. This allows us to map our genomic model to a simple graph representation. <p> We call it a LOF (Figure 4.b). An ordering relationship is now said to belong to a LOF. For instance, we would describe the situation in C" in LOF i ]. The LOF is similar in spirit to the orientation windows introduced in <ref> [12] </ref> for orderings between points. For a given LOF, LOF i , we may not know which of its two possible orientations is correct. Therefore, we construct the mirror image of LOF i , denoted by LOF i . <p> At a minimum, this requires the presence of the same pair of objects (A,B) in the two LOFs with relationship constraints between them expressing orientation rather than just overlap information. For ordering relationships between points <ref> [12] </ref>, we simply would need to identify one pair of points (A,B) that belongs to both LOFs and that has an ordering relationship in each LOF, i.e., (A before B) or (B before A).
