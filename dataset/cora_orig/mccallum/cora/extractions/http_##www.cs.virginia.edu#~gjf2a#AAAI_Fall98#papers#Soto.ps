Reference-contexts: Insects achieve the correct navigation by minimizing the difference between the learned and the current perceived features of the landmark. In <ref> [1] </ref> bees were trained to recognize their home place using a cylindrical landmark. When the size of the learned cylinder was changed the bees searched further from a cylinder that was larger than the one that they were accustomed to see, and closer to one that was smaller.

Reference-contexts: Dead reckoning estimations are given by knowledge about the calibration of self motion with respect to spatio-temporal variations relating objects in the surrounding [7]. In the case of landmark, studies based on the vision for action and vision for perception paradigm <ref> [5] </ref> show that humans use landmarks with two purposes: positioning and servoing. To illustrate this, consider the way that humans navigate to a goal. First, using an internal representation of the environment one constructs a path to the goal given by spatial relation of clear features of the environment.

Reference-contexts: Humans also navigate in the world using dead reckoning, and memories of learned landmarks and their spatial relations. Dead reckoning estimations are given by knowledge about the calibration of self motion with respect to spatio-temporal variations relating objects in the surrounding <ref> [7] </ref>. In the case of landmark, studies based on the vision for action and vision for perception paradigm [5] show that humans use landmarks with two purposes: positioning and servoing. To illustrate this, consider the way that humans navigate to a goal.

Reference-contexts: In the case of navigational landmarks and odometry, each edge of the topological graph should receive a joint probability. All these probabilities should be updated dynamically. Bayesian networks and Markov chains can be some candidates to maintain this probabilistic topological graph. In <ref> [8] </ref> partial Markov chains were used to plan the path of a mobile robot using a topological graph. Even though this implementation was especially customized for an office-building environment, this work is a good example of the performance and complexities involves in a probabilistic approach.
