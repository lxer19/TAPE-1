Abstract: This paper presents a report processing method with object-centered semantics. The syntactic analysis is performed along classical generative principles. though with a deliberately simple output as a list of index-value doublets, which the semantic module processes using methods in an objectoriented framework. The final representation is made of two types of object-centred structures: 1) case-like. event-level dated structures corresponding to the input clauses: 2) detailed representation of the current state of an agent of the reference world, plus records for the follow-up of a task over time. Uncertainty, imprecision, and previsions are handled using specialized fields. This framework is applied to the processing of daily naval reports In English. The objective of the project is the processing of messages in English reporting the daily evolution of naval situation in the Mediterranean. The information extracted is exploited for situation monitoring. maintenance of a historical database. formulation of previsions, and detection of highlights and anomalies.
