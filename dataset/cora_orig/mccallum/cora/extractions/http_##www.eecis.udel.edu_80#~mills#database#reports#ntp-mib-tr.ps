Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol used to synchronize timekeeping among a set of distributed time servers and clients <ref> [1] </ref>. NTP has undergone significant evolution over the years since it was first proposed, culminating in the most recent NTP Version 3 described in RFC-1305. NTP is built on the Internet Protocol (IP) [2] and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [3], which provide a connectionless transport mechanism.
