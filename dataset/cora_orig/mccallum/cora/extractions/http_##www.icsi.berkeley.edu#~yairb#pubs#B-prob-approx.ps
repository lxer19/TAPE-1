Abstract: This paper provides a novel technique for the analysis of randomized algorithms for optimization problems on metric spaces, by relating the randomized performance ratio for any metric space to the randomized performance ratio for a set of "simple" metric spaces. We define a notion of a set of metric spaces that probabilistically-approximates another metric space. We prove that any metric space can be probabilistically-approximated by hierarchically well-separated trees (HST) with a polylogarithmic distortion. These metric spaces are "simple" as being: (1) tree metrics. (2) natural for applying a divide-and-conquer algorithmic approach. The technique presented is of particular interest in the context of on-line computation. A large number of on-line algorithmic problems, including metrical task systems [BLS87], server problems [MMS88] , distributed paging [BFR92], and dynamic storage rearrangement [FMRW95], are defined in terms of some metric space. Typically for these problems, there are linear lower bounds on the competitive ratio of deterministic algorithms. Although randomization against an oblivious adversary has the potential of overcoming these high ratios, very little progress has been made in the analysis. We demonstrate the use of our technique by obtaining substantially improved results for two different on-line problems. For metrical task systems [BLS87] we give first sub-linear randomized competitive ratio for a large set of metric spaces. For constrained file migration [BFR92] we give first randomized algorithms for general networks with polylogarithmic competitive ratio.

Reference-contexts: One natural set to consider is: tree metrics (also called additive metrics). Indeed, intensive recent research has been concerned with approximating metric spaces by tree metrics. The numerical taxonomy problem <ref> [BG92, ABFNPT96] </ref> deals with such approximations. The main difference is that in numerical taxonomy it is assumed that the original metric is close to being additive, and so one expects approximations to within a very small error.

Reference-contexts: We show that for some network the problem has an (m) lower bound on the deterministic competitive ratio and an (log m) lower bound on the randomized competitive ratio, where m is the total aggregate memory in the network. Albers and Koga <ref> [AK95] </ref> solve the problem in the uniform metric case giving a randomized upper bound of O (log K). We give a randomized algorithm for k-HST's with competitive ratio O (log m), and thus get a randomized algorithm for general networks with competitive ratio of O (log m log 2 n).

Reference-contexts: This leads to the notion of probabilistic metric approximations we propose. Seminal work along these lines begun with Karp's observation [Karp89] that the n-cycle can be 2-probabilistically-approximated by an n-line, motivated by its application to the K-server problem. Alon, Karp, Peleg and West <ref> [AKPW91] </ref> have taken this idea forward in considering probabilistic-approximations of graphs by spanning trees. Their result implies that every metric space can be 2 O ( p log n log log n) -probabilistically-approximated by a tree met ric.

Reference-contexts: This result can be viewed as an oblivious probabilistic version of low-diameter graph decompositions <ref> [AP90, LS91, ENRS95] </ref>. 1.4 Applications to On-line Computation As already pointed out, the probabilistic approximation of metric spaces is of particular importance in the case of on-line problems, where the randomization against oblivious adversaries (I.e., adversaries that cannot see the algorithm's coin tosses [BBKTW90]) is very powerful. <p> This follows from the fact that the structure of the k-HST tree can be efficiently kept in the original network, for routing purposes, by using ITR (interval routing scheme), as described in <ref> [ABLP89, AP90] </ref>, with only polylogarithmic memory per processor.

Viewing a distributed network as a HST makes another step in simplifying the exploitation of locality of reference in a distributed environment. While constructions such as <ref> [AP90, LS91] </ref> allow to use graph decompositions for similar purposes, the properties of HST's make our (randomized) construction more powerful and more simple to use. The tool of a probabilistic partition which is in the heart of the HST's construction may be of independent interest.

However their method is deterministic and therefore does not apply for randomization against an oblivious adversary. <p> This result can be viewed as an oblivious probabilistic version of low-diameter graph decompositions <ref> [AP90, LS91, ENRS95] </ref>. 1.4 Applications to On-line Computation As already pointed out, the probabilistic approximation of metric spaces is of particular importance in the case of on-line problems, where the randomization against oblivious adversaries (I.e., adversaries that cannot see the algorithm's coin tosses [BBKTW90]) is very powerful.

Reference-contexts: While the study of deterministic algorithms for these problems has been quite successful, the competitive ratio 1 is typically linear. Although randomization against an oblivious adversary has the potential of overcoming these high ratios (cf. <ref> [BBKTW90, FKLMSY88] </ref>) very little progress has been made in the analysis other than for specific cases. We focus on a particular class of metric spaces that probabilistically approximates every metric spaces with a polylogarithmic distortion. <p> The most obvious example is the paging problem with a cache of size K, where the deterministic competitive ratio is K [ST85] while the randomized competitive ratio (against oblivious adversaries) is fi (log K) <ref> [FKLMSY88] </ref>. Many problems that are defined in terms of metric spaces (e.g., [BLS87, MMS88, BFR92, FMRW95]) are still almost entirely open in terms of their randomized competitive ratio (against an oblivious adversary). <p> The metrical task system problem is closely related to the the (n 1)-server problem [MMS88] on n points also called the pursuit-evasion game. Both upper and lower bounds for one problem translate to the other. fi (log n) bounds for the uniform metric space were given in <ref> [FKLMSY88, BLS87] </ref>. A lower bound of ( q log log n ) was given in [BKRS93]. They also give O (log n) upper bounds in graphs that can be viewed as binary k-HST's for very large k. <p> Since HST's are "almost uniform" between subtrees it is just natural to consider applying algorithms for a uniform case recursively. Both of our algorithms run recursively copies of the randomized marking algorithm of <ref> [FKLMSY88] </ref> for the K-server problem on a uniform metric space (or equivalently for the paging problem). The marking algorithm works in phases. At the beginning of a phase all servers are unmarked. When a request arrives, if there is a server at the requested point it is just marked.

Reference-contexts: The performance ratio in this case is known as the competitive ratio, proposed by Sleator and Tarjan [ST85]. A large number of on-line algorithmic problems, including metrical task systems [BLS87], server problems [MMS88] , distributed paging [BFR92], and dynamic storage rearrangement <ref> [FMRW95] </ref>, are defined in terms of metric spaces. Such problems address issues concerning with various fields such as resource management, communication networks, and dynamic data structures. While the study of deterministic algorithms for these problems has been quite successful, the competitive ratio 1 is typically linear. <p> The most obvious example is the paging problem with a cache of size K, where the deterministic competitive ratio is K [ST85] while the randomized competitive ratio (against oblivious adversaries) is fi (log K) [FKLMSY88]. Many problems that are defined in terms of metric spaces (e.g., <ref> [BLS87, MMS88, BFR92, FMRW95] </ref>) are still almost entirely open in terms of their randomized competitive ratio (against an oblivious adversary). Our approach implies that it suffices to give algorithms for k-HST's in order to obtain upper bounds for any metric space, with only polylogarithmic overhead.

Reference-contexts: This is a natural generalization of the uni-processor paging problem and a special case of the distributed paging problem [BFR92, ABF93b, ABF96] where files may also be replicated, but is of special interest since many systems allow only file migrations, to avoid issues of copy consistency (see <ref> [GS90] </ref> for a survey). Let a network be represented by a weighted graph G = (V; E; w). A set of files F resides in different nodes in the network. Processor v can accommodate in its local memory up to K v files.

Reference-contexts: In particular this is true for the n-cycle as follows from the recent work of Rabinovich and Raz [RR95]. This leads to the notion of probabilistic metric approximations we propose. Seminal work along these lines begun with Karp's observation <ref> [Karp89] </ref> that the n-cycle can be 2-probabilistically-approximated by an n-line, motivated by its application to the K-server problem.

Viewing a distributed network as a HST makes another step in simplifying the exploitation of locality of reference in a distributed environment. While constructions such as <ref> [AP90, LS91] </ref> allow to use graph decompositions for similar purposes, the properties of HST's make our (randomized) construction more powerful and more simple to use. The tool of a probabilistic partition which is in the heart of the HST's construction may be of independent interest.
