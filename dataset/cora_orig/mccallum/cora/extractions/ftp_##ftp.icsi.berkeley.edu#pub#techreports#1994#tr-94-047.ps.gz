Abstract: Compressed digital video is one of the most important types of traffic in future integrated services networks. It is difficult to support this class of traffic since, on one hand, compressed video is bursty, while on the other hand, it requires performance guarantees from the network. The common belief is that we are unlikely to achieve a high network utilization while providing performance guarantees to such bursty sources. In this paper, we introduce a new Deterministic Bounding Interval-Dependent (D-BIND) traffic model, together with tight analysis techniques, to explore the possibility of providing deterministic performance guarantees to VBR traffic while still achieving a reasonable network utilization. The D-BIND model consists of a family of rate-interval pairs where the rate is a bounding rate over the interval length. The model captures the intuitive property that over longer interval lengths, a source may be bounded by a rate lower than its peak rate and closer to its long-term average rate. While the D-BIND model is a general deterministic model that can be used to characterize a wide variety of sources, in this study, we focus on MPEG-compressed video. Using two 10 minute traces, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model and show that, contrary to common belief, reasonable network utilization can be achieved for compressed video, even when deterministic guarantees are provided.

Reference-contexts: For example, the following two observations hold: the maximum busy period provides an upper bound on delay for any work-conserving server; the maximum backlog divided by the link speed provides an upper bound on delay for a FCFS server. Delay bounds for other policies can also be expressed <ref> [1, 4, 12, 15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, VBR traffic is also bursty: if resources are reserved according to peak rates, the network may be under-utilized if the peak-to-average rate ratios are high. Because of this concern, feedback control algorithms have also been proposed for VBR video <ref> [2, 8, 10] </ref>. However, these algorithms cannot provide the performance guarantees desired by the application. Thus, the key question to be answered is the following: can performance guarantees be provided to VBR traffic without significantly under-utilizing the network? In [6], two types of performance guarantees are proposed: statistical and deterministic.

Reference-contexts: is that for a given arrival process A, the tightest time invariant deterministic bound on arrivals in any interval of length t is by definition E (t) = sup A [s; s + t] (1) E (t) is called the empirical envelope in [11], and the minimum envelope process in <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, in order for a traffic model's constraint function b (t) to be a time invariant upper bound on A, it must be an upper approximation to E (t).

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [4] </ref>, a source is said to satisfy a (; ) leaky-bucket model if during any interval of length t, the number of bits that the source transmits is less than + t. The (; ) model was extended in [13, 14] with a proposed burstiness curve to characterize traffic. <p> Before defining the D-BIND model, we further motivate it by describing the analysis techniques used to derive connection admission control conditions for deterministic guarantees. 2 2.2 Delay Analysis Deterministic admission control conditions rely on the delay analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 20] </ref> which may be described as follows. Figure 2 illustrates the different components of the analysis. The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is bits. <p> For example, the following two observations hold: the maximum busy period provides an upper bound on delay for any work-conserving server; the maximum backlog divided by the link speed provides an upper bound on delay for a FCFS server. Delay bounds for other policies can also be expressed <ref> [1, 4, 12, 15] </ref>. <p> k , where d k = maxft 0 j b 0 k (t) ltg (5) k (ff) is defined for all ff by b 0 fi0 X b k;j (fi) + q=1 j2C q b q;j (ff + fi) lfig: (6) The proof is by extension of the results of <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> It should also be noted that both the D-BIND and Xmin models do significantly better than peak-rate reservation which results in an average utilization of 23%. With the improved analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 20] </ref>, even for small delay bounds, DMG's significantly greater than 1 are achievable. For example, for a delay bound of 9 msec, 38 channels may be multiplexed for a DMG of 1.3. <p> The experiment of Figure 8 used a concave constraint function. However, the possible utilization gain of using non-concave constraint functions is not apparent in the homogeneous case. Thus, we defer further discussion of concavity to future work. 5 Conclusion The analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 18, 20] </ref> have shown that a peak-rate resource allocation scheme is not required in order to provide deterministic performance guarantees. In this paper, we demonstrated several things.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 2 If a piece-wise linear constraint function b (t) with N linear segments is concave, then the source may be fully policed (i.e., Equation (3) holds) with a cascade of N leaky buckets. The proof is given in Theorem 5.1 of <ref> [5] </ref>. Note however, as shown in Section 3, a source does not necessarily have a concave constraint function b (t). In this case, a piece-wise linear non-concave constraint function may be policed with a cascade of leaky buckets with state-dependent token-generation rates.

Reference-contexts: Among these, delay sensitive VBR traffic poses a unique challenge.

Thus, the key question to be answered is the following: can performance guarantees be provided to VBR traffic without significantly under-utilizing the network? In <ref> [6] </ref>, two types of performance guarantees are proposed: statistical and deterministic. While statistical guarantees provide probabilistic bounds on delay and throughput, deterministic guarantees provide an absolute bound on delay and throughput so that performance bounds are met for all packets of a connection, even in the worst case. <p> For example, if a source promises that its minimum packet inter-arrival time is Xmin, this may be easily verified and enforced by the network. Alternatively, statistical models of the source are inherently much more difficult to enforce. 2.1 Deterministic Traffic Models In the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model of <ref> [6] </ref> (we will refer to this as the Xmin model), a source is constrained so that its minimum packet spacing is Xmin, its maximum packet size is Smax, and that in every interval of length I, it may send no more than I=Xave packets.

Reference-contexts: important observation about the traffic constraint function is that for a given arrival process A, the tightest time invariant deterministic bound on arrivals in any interval of length t is by definition E (t) = sup A [s; s + t] (1) E (t) is called the empirical envelope in <ref> [11] </ref>, and the minimum envelope process in [3]. Thus, in order for a traffic model's constraint function b (t) to be a time invariant upper bound on A, it must be an upper approximation to E (t). <p> In the experiments below, we calculate the maximum number of homogeneous connections that can be multiplexed at a link so that all connections receive a deterministic guarantee on delay and throughput (see <ref> [11] </ref> for investigations of the heterogeneous case and scheduling disciplines other than RCSP).

Reference-contexts: Of course, this problem is not limited to the analysis presented here. Two factors can alleviate this problem. First, with the Dynamic Connection Management Scheme <ref> [16] </ref>, a real-time channel can change its traffic specification or performance requirements during the duration of the connection. Thus, a source can adapt its (R n ; I n ) rate-interval pairs to the least upper bound.

Reference-contexts: As well, the Xmin model can be expressed in terms of the D-BIND model by using a different interpolation function. 2.5 Admission Control Two important components to providing performance guarantees in a connection-oriented network are connection admission control and the packet service discipline. The RCSP service discipline <ref> [19] </ref> provides the mechanisms needed to provide integrated services to heterogeneous sources. The scheduler is based on a number of FCFS priority queues where queue k has an associated delay bound d k . A number of heterogeneous connections can be multiplexed at a given priority level k.

Reference-contexts: We then analyze the achievable network utilization for real sources by characterizing several MPEG compressed video sequences using the D-BIND model and applying the tighter bounding techniques used in <ref> [20] </ref>. We show that, contrary to common belief, reasonable network utilization can be achieved for compressed video, even when deterministic performance guarantees are provided. <p> Before defining the D-BIND model, we further motivate it by describing the analysis techniques used to derive connection admission control conditions for deterministic guarantees. 2 2.2 Delay Analysis Deterministic admission control conditions rely on the delay analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 20] </ref> which may be described as follows. Figure 2 illustrates the different components of the analysis. The horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is bits. <p> respective constraints b j (t), and with a link speed l, and a maximum packet size s, a deterministic upper bound on delay for all connections is given by d = l t0 n X b j (t) lt + sg: (2) The proof is given in Theorem 1 of <ref> [20] </ref>. The equation indicates that even better bounds are possible with new traffic models. That is, if a given traffic source can be more tightly bounded by a different constraint function than those of previous traffic models, the resulting maximum delay bound of Equation (2) will be lower. <p> Details may also be found in [18]. 3 Traffic Characterization and Network Utilization This section evaluates the effectiveness of the D-BIND model by analyzing the switch or multiplexer utilization achieved with the new model and comparing the results to utilizations obtained with the Xmin model using the bounds in <ref> [20] </ref>. Also for comparison, utilizations obtained with peak-rate reservation are also investigated. (By peak-rate reservation, we mean an admission control scheme in which the sum of the source's peak rates are constrained to be less than the link speed.) Two traces of MPEG compressed video are analyzed as traffic sources. <p> It should also be noted that both the D-BIND and Xmin models do significantly better than peak-rate reservation which results in an average utilization of 23%. With the improved analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 20] </ref>, even for small delay bounds, DMG's significantly greater than 1 are achievable. For example, for a delay bound of 9 msec, 38 channels may be multiplexed for a DMG of 1.3. <p> The experiment of Figure 8 used a concave constraint function. However, the possible utilization gain of using non-concave constraint functions is not apparent in the homogeneous case. Thus, we defer further discussion of concavity to future work. 5 Conclusion The analysis techniques of <ref> [4, 18, 20] </ref> have shown that a peak-rate resource allocation scheme is not required in order to provide deterministic performance guarantees. In this paper, we demonstrated several things.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the goal of the D-BIND model is a more accurate source characterization that results in a tighter (lower) traffic constraint function b (t). The effect is thus a higher network utilization and a higher DMG for a given deterministic delay and throughput constraint. 2.3 D-BIND Model Definition In <ref> [21] </ref>, we proposed a Stochastic Bounding Interval Dependent (S-BIND) model for providing statistical performance guarantees.
