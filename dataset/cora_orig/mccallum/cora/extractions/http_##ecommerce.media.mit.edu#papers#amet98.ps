Abstract: Software agents help automate a variety of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. Although shopping agents provide convenience for consumers and yield more efficient markets, todays first-generation shopping agents are limited to comparing merchant offerings only on price instead of their full range of value. As such, they do a disservice to both consumers and retailers by hiding important merchant value-added services from consumer consideration. Likewise, the increasingly popular online auctions pit sellers against buyers in distributive negotiation tug-of-wars over price. This paper analyzes these approaches from economic, behavioral, and software agent perspectives then proposes integrative negotiation as a more suitable approach to retail electronic commerce. Finally, we identify promising techniques (e.g., multi-attribute utility theory, distributed constraint satisfaction, and conjoint analysis) for implementing agent-mediated integrative negotiation.

Reference-contexts: Forrester Research estimates that online retail sales were at about $600 million USD in 1996, will exceed $2 billion USD in 1997, and will reach $17 billion USD by 2001 <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition, online markets are more efficient than their physical-world counterparts thus lowering transaction costs for both merchants and consumers.

Reference-contexts: In addition, online markets are more efficient than their physical-world counterparts thus lowering transaction costs for both merchants and consumers. For example, low transaction costs is one reason why Amazon.com <ref> [2] </ref>, a virtual bookstore, can offer a greater selection and lower prices than its physical-world competitors. 1 . 1 . Cross-Merchant Product Comparisons As in the physical world, an online merchant prefers to have consumers shop only at its own Web site as depicted in Figure 1 (a).

Reference-contexts: There are an increasing number of software agent tools available to merchants for enhancing and differentiating their product offerings online such as Firefly Networks recommendation system <ref> [3, 8] </ref> and PersonaLogics buying guides [4]. These tools help consumers make buying decisions within a specific merchants site. However, consumers also compare product offerings across merchant boundaries as depicted in Figure 1 (b).

Reference-contexts: In a fully competitive market, no one has market power forcing prices down to the cost of producing the most expensive (marginal) unit <ref> [5] </ref>. Therefore, without merchant differentiation, retailers (and other intermediaries) are reduced to competing on marginal costs leaving little room for profit. <p> Distributive negotiation is the decision-making process of resolving a conflict involving two or more parties over a single mutually exclusive goal. The economics literature describes this more specifically as the effects on market price of a limited resource given its supply and demand among self-interested parties <ref> [5] </ref>. The game theory literature describes this situation as a zerosum game where as the value along a single dimension shifts in either direction, one side is better off and the other is worse off [14]. <p> However, first-degree price discrimination is tenuous in markets with monopolistic competition i.e., a market with a large number of firms selling similar but differentiated products with no significant barriers to entry which characterizes most retail markets <ref> [5] </ref> . This suggests that DCSP techniques may not be overly cooperative for bilateral integrative negotiations in retail markets. 10 3 . 4 .

Reference-contexts: This paper suggests a reversal of this problematic trend in cross-merchant shopping agent approaches in order to restore merchant differentiation and thus their market power. With so much money at stake, this problem warrants attention. Although free markets are inherently nature red in tooth and claw <ref> [6] </ref>, this need not be the relationship between retailers and their customers. Rather, we propose that a more cooperative and personalized integrative negotiation approach differentiates retailers offerings in online markets better than todays limited price-comparison shopping agents and unnecessarily hostile distributive negotiation (e.g., auction) approaches. 1 . 3 .

Reference-contexts: Consumer Buying Behavior Model Consumer Buying Behavior (CBB) marketing research builds descriptive theories and models for analyzing consumers actions and decisions involved in buying and using goods and services. Guttman et al augment traditional CBB research with concepts from Software Agents research to accommodate electronic markets <ref> [7] </ref>. Table 1 lists all six stages of this CBB model and gives representative examples of agent systems that fall within this space. Briefly, the Product Brokering stage comprises the retrieval of information to help determine what to buy. This encompasses the evaluation of product alternatives based on consumer-provided criteria. <p> Need Identification 2. Product Brokering 3. Merchant Brokering 4. Negotiation 5. Purchase and Delivery 6. Product Service and Evaluation Table 1 - The six stages of the CBB model with representative examples of agent mediators <ref> [7] </ref>. Merchant Brokering stage combines this consideration set with merchantspecific information to help determine who to buy from. This includes the evaluation of merchant alternatives based on consumer-provided criteria (e.g., price, warranty, availability, delivery time, reputation, etc.). The Negotiation stage is about how to determine the terms of the transaction. <p> In other markets (e.g., stocks, automobile, fine art, local markets, etc.), the negotiation of price or other aspects of the deal are integral to product and merchant brokering. As noted in <ref> [7] </ref>, this analysis of retail electronic commerce represents an approximation and simplification of complex behaviors. CBB stages often overlap and migration from one to another is sometimes nonlinear and iterative. 2 . <p> Price-Only Shopping Agents and Distributive Negotiation Agents There are several types of software shopping agents that assist consumers in making buying decisions. Table 1 gives representative examples of agents that play different roles in mediating online transactions. See <ref> [7] </ref> for a treatment of agent systems playing in the Product Brokering stage of the CBB model. 2 . 1 . Price-comparison Shopping Agents After Product Brokering comes Merchant Brokering in the CBB model shown in Table 1. Andersen Consultings BargainFinder [9] was the first merchant brokering shopping agent.

Price-comparison Shopping Agents After Product Brokering comes Merchant Brokering in the CBB model shown in Table 1. Andersen Consultings BargainFinder <ref> [9] </ref> was the first merchant brokering shopping agent. Given a specific music CD, BargainFinder requests its price (including shipping) from each of nine different online music catalogs using the same requests as a web browser. BargainFinder then presents its results to the consumer.

Reference-contexts: Its also interesting to note that CDLand initially blocked BargainFinder agents but eventually decided to compete on price. However, a visit to their site indicates that it has been deactivated for the past seven months due to new management and some initial transition difficulties <ref> [10] </ref>. We can only presume that a lack of merchant differentiation and market power lead to their demise.

Reference-contexts: Economists, game theorists, business managers, political scientists, and artificial intelligence researchers each provide unique perspectives on its meaning. The business negotiation literature defines two types of negotiation: distributive negotia tion and integrative negotiation <ref> [13] </ref>. Distributive negotiation is the decision-making process of resolving a conflict involving two or more parties over a single mutually exclusive goal. The economics literature describes this more specifically as the effects on market price of a limited resource given its supply and demand among self-interested parties [5]. <p> Integrative Negotiation As introduced in section 2.2, the business negotiation literature defines two types of negotiation: distributive negotiation and integrative negotiation. Integrative negotiation is the decision-making process of resolving a conflict involving two or more parties over multiple interdependent, but n o n mutually exclusive goals <ref> [13] </ref>. The study of how to analyze multi-objective decisions comes from economics research and is called multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) [40].

Reference-contexts: The game theory literature describes this situation as a zerosum game where as the value along a single dimension shifts in either direction, one side is better off and the other is worse off <ref> [14] </ref>. The benefit of dynamically negotiating a price for a product instead of fixing it is that it relieves the seller from needing to determine the value of the good a priori. Rather, this burden is pushed into the marketplace itself. <p> The game theory literature describes integrative negotiation as a nonzero-sum game where as the values along multiple dimensions shift in different directions, it is possible for all parties to be better off <ref> [14] </ref>. In essence, integrative negotiation is a win-win type of negotiation. An example of this is depicted in Figure 7. This is in stark contrast to distributive negotiation which is a win-lose type of negotiation as discussed in section 2.2.

Reference-contexts: More recently, software agents have been taught distributive negotiation skills (e.g., auctioneering and auction bidding skills) to help automate the Negotiation CBB stage of consumer-to-consumer and retail shopping over the Internet. K a s b a h <ref> [15, 16] </ref> is a Web-based multi-agent classified ad system where users create buying agents and selling agents to help transact goods. These agents automate much of the Merchant Brokering and Negotiation CBB stages for both buyers and sellers. <p> The simplicity of these negotiation heuristics makes it intuitive for users to understand what their agents are doing in the marketplace. 1 This was important for user acceptance as observed in a recent Media Lab experiment <ref> [15] </ref>. A larger Kasbah experiment is now underway at MIT allowing students to transact books and music [16]. AuctionBot [19, 20] is a general purpose Internet auction server at the University of Michigan.
