Abstract: One of the main hurdles to improved CLIR effectiveness is resolving ambiguity associated with translation. Availability of resources is also a problem. First we present a technique based on co-occurrence statistics from unlinked corpora which can be used to reduce the ambiguity associated with phrasal and term translation. We then combine this method with other techniques for reducing ambiguity and achieve more than 90% monolingual effectiveness. Finally, we compare the co-occurrence method with parallel corpus and machine translation techniques and show that good retrieval effectiveness can be achieved without complex resources.

Reference-contexts: Section 7 reports on the effectiveness of combining disambiguation methods described above with query expansion which was shown to reduce translation ambiguity in [BC97, BC96]. Query expansion was done via Local Context Analysis (LCA) which is described more fully in [XC96]. LCA is a modification of local feedback <ref> [AF77] </ref>. It differs from local feedback in that the query is expanded with the best concepts from the top ranked passages rather than the top ranked documents. Training data for the pre-translation LCA experiments consisted of the documents in the 208 MB El Norte (ISM) database from the TREC collection.

Reference-contexts: As with parallel corpora, the question remains of what other disambiguation methods could be used in a more general context to augment these techniques. Dictionary translation has been the starting point for other researchers <ref> [BC96, HG96] </ref>. The method relies on the availability of machine readable dictionaries (MRD). Dictionaries like the other resources mentioned, may be proprietary or costly. Although on-line dictionaries are becoming more widely available, the coverage and quality may be lower than one would like. <p> Simple dictionary translation via machine readable dictionary yields ambiguous translations. Target language queries are translated by replacing source language words or multi-term concepts by their target language equivalents. Translation error is due to three factors <ref> [BC96, HG96] </ref>. The first factor is the addition of extraneous terms to the query. This is because a dictionary entry may list several senses for a term, each having one or more possible translations. The second is failure to translate technical terminology which is often not found in general dictionaries. <p> Words that were not found in the dictionary were added to the new query without translation. The Collins Spanish-English bilingual MRD was used for the translations. For a more detailed description of this process, see <ref> [BC96] </ref>. Section 4 compares the effectiveness of disambiguating term Caso Waldeheim. Razones de la controversia que rodea las acciones de Waldheim durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Waldheim Case. Reasons for the controversy surrounding the actions of Waldheim during the Second World War. Educacion sexual. <p> Improvement appears to be due to the removal of error caused by the addition of extraneous terms via the translation process. Section 7 reports on the effectiveness of combining disambiguation methods described above with query expansion which was shown to reduce translation ambiguity in <ref> [BC97, BC96] </ref>. Query expansion was done via Local Context Analysis (LCA) which is described more fully in [XC96]. LCA is a modification of local feedback [AF77].

Reference-contexts: The second is failure to translate technical terminology which is often not found in general dictionaries. Third is the failure to translate multi-term concepts as phrases or to translate them poorly. Previous work <ref> [BC97] </ref> showed how query expansion could be used to reduce translation error and bring cross-language effectiveness up to 68% of monolingual. However, this still leaves a lot of room for improvement. <p> Improvement appears to be due to the removal of error caused by the addition of extraneous terms via the translation process. Section 7 reports on the effectiveness of combining disambiguation methods described above with query expansion which was shown to reduce translation ambiguity in <ref> [BC97, BC96] </ref>. Query expansion was done via Local Context Analysis (LCA) which is described more fully in [XC96]. LCA is a modification of local feedback [AF77]. <p> It should be noted that poor translations can decrease effectiveness as shown in <ref> [BC97] </ref>. One way to reduce this problem, could be to include more query terms in the co-occurrence analysis. Including more terms would provide more context and may further disambiguate translations. In particular, the inclusion of additional terms having unambiguous translations themselves would provide an anchor point. <p> The co-occurrence method was performed with a window size of 250 terms. Queries were then expanded via LCA prior to translation, after translation or both before and after translation. We also compared these results to the expansion of queries translated via the method reported in our earlier work <ref> [BC97] </ref> and which we refer to as sense1. The sense1 method proceeds as follows. Multi-term concepts are translated as phrases using the phrase dictionary. The remaining terms are translated word-by-word without the aid of part-of-speech.

Reference-contexts: We also report precision at five, ten, twenty, thirty, and one-hundred documents retrieved. All work in this study was performed using the INQUERY information retrieval sys tem. INQUERY is based on the Bayesian inference net model and is described in <ref> [TC91b, TC91a, CCB95] </ref>. All significance tests used the paired sign test. 4 Disambiguating Word-By-Word Translations If each source language term has more than one target language equivalent, its term translations will be ambiguous. In these experiments, queries were translated word-by-word and we demonstrate the disambiguating effect of two simple techniques.

Reference-contexts: Even if a system works well for one pair of languages, each new language pair requires a significant new effort. Parallel corpora are being used by several groups e.g.[LL90, Dav96, CYF + 97]. One approach at NMSU <ref> [DO97] </ref> has been to translate via machine readable dictionaries (MRD) followed by a disambiguation phase using part-of-speech (POS) and parallel corpus analysis. However, parallel corpora are hard to come by. <p> Analysis of these paired documents can be used to infer the most likely translations of terms between languages in the corpus. We employ parallel corpus analysis to look at the impact of query term disambiguation on CLIR effectiveness. The technique is a modification of one used by NMSU <ref> [DO97] </ref> and is described below. Source language (Spanish) queries are first tagged using a part-of-speech (POS) tagger. Each Spanish source term is replaced by all possible target language (English) translations for the term's POS.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the ambiguity problem, each of the approaches to CLIR has drawbacks associated with the availability of resources. This is made more critical as the number of languages represented in electronic media continues to expand. MT systems can be employed <ref> [GLY96] </ref>, but tend to need more context than is in a query for accurate translation. The development of such a system requires an enormous amount of time and resources. Even if a system works well for one pair of languages, each new language pair requires a significant new effort.
