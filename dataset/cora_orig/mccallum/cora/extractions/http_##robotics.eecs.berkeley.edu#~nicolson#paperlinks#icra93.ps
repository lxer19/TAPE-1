Title: Compliant Control of Threaded Fastener Insertion  
Author: Edward J. Nicolson and Ronald S. Fearing 
Address: Berkeley, CA 94720  
Affiliation: Department of EE&CS University of California  
Abstract: Controlled compliance and accommodation matrix techniques are considered for robust insertion of threaded fasteners. Errors in translational positioning are shown to be easily corrected. Errors in the angle of tilt between the threaded parts are shown to be much more difficult to correct and constrain the region of convergence for simple linear techniques.

Reference-contexts: There are two obstacles to the full automation of screw threading: 1) feeding and holding the parts and 2) controlling the parts to ensure proper mating and detect part failures in the presence of positional uncertainty. Given current screw head geometries, the first problem is considerable. <ref> [Mikels 91] </ref> has addressed it by developing a helical head driver with a centering recess. The Torx TM head is alone among current screwdriver heads in providing control of the bolt during insertion.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction According to a study by Nevins and Whitney <ref> [Nevins 80] </ref> the insertion and tightening of threaded fasteners is one of the twelve most common assembly tasks, yet little published work has considered the type of control best suited for the assembly of threaded parts. <p> Recently [Tsujimura 91] presented a system identification technique to improve position control of screw threading. Their efforts were hampered by an imprecise robot and lack of a model for the threaded parts. [Tao 90] used a Remote Center of Compliance (RCC) technique, motivated by <ref> [Nevins 80, Whitney 82] </ref>, but again without a model for the threaded parts. Regions of convergence were not presented. [Blaer 62] provides guidelines for the rotational speed of a nut being fitted on to a bolt with a given axial stiffness when there are no orientation errors. <p> Thus, as the analyses of <ref> [Nevins 80] </ref> and [Schimmels 90] show, either low stiffness or high accommodation will correct for these types of errors. Our main concern becomes the control of the tilt angle and the avoidance of cross-threading and jamming.

Reference-contexts: The inequality comes from the fact that &lt; p 3=8. Note that this angle is 1=2 that given by <ref> [Nevins and Whitney 89] </ref> as we consider the cross threading angle to be the minimum tilt angle for the onset of cross threading. <p> As would be expected, j increases quickly with the allowance ratio a. Given standard bolt dimensions c is typically 3 or 4 times larger than j (1). This indicates, as <ref> [Nevins and Whitney 89] </ref> point out, that for all but the smallest fasteners c is large enough to avoid cross threading.

Reference-contexts: For our experiments we drilled a hole in the center of the bolt and attached it to the motor directly to concentrate on the second problem, controlling the trajectory of the nut and bolt. We proceed by reviewing the fundamentals of our screw model presented in <ref> [Nicolson and Fearing 91] </ref> in section 2. In section 3 we discuss the maximum tilt angle before jamming. In section 4 we present an accommodation controller and in section 5 we derive conditions for jamming given the manipulator stiffness.

Reference-contexts: For near c , t z increases sharply with z , whereas for a smaller tilt the increase is more gradual. typical for a steel/steel contact <ref> [Oberg 46] </ref>, then equation (6) predicts t z =t of 0.21, which compares favor ably with the data. The most interesting results come from checking the validity of the tilt angle equation (3) and the stiffness condition equation (7).

Reference-contexts: Assuming that the manipulator allows velocity control and is fitted with a force sensing device, we can use an accommodation matrix <ref> [Schimmels 90] </ref> to servo the velocity based on the force feedback according to: _ c e = _ c e o A ^ f a The choice of non-zero elements in A is based on our assumptions about initial positioning uncertainty. <p> Thus, as the analyses of [Nevins 80] and <ref> [Schimmels 90] </ref> show, either low stiffness or high accommodation will correct for these types of errors. Our main concern becomes the control of the tilt angle and the avoidance of cross-threading and jamming.

Reference-contexts: In this manner Smith claims the ability to discriminate proper fastening from thread stripping and thread crossing as well as detecting faulty fasteners. According to <ref> [Weber] </ref> torque and angle monitoring is now the standard for high performance screw insertion. The data from these sensors is commonly used for statistical analysis of failure rates by process control engineers. Current automatic insertion methods do not guarantee successful insertion.
