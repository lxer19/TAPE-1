Abstract: Agents may contract some of their tasks to other agent even when they do not share a common goal. An agent may try to contract some of the tasks that it cannot perform by itself, or that may be performed more efficiently by other agents. One self-motivated agent may convince another self-motivated agent to help it with its task, by promises of rewards, even if the agents are not assumed to be benevolent. We propose techniques that provide efficient ways to reach contracting in varied situations: the agents have full information about the environment and each other or subcontracting when the agents do not know the exact state of the world. We consider situations of repeated encounters, cases of asymmetric information, situations where the agents lack information about each other, and cases where an agent subcontracts a task to a group of agents. Situations where there is competition among possible contracted agents or possible contracting agents are also considered. In all situations we would like the contracted agent to carry out the task efficiently without the need of close supervision by the contracting agent. fl This paper is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IRI-9123460 and is an extension of [ Kraus, 1993 ] . I would like to thank Jonathan Wilkenfeld and Barbara Grosz for their comments.

Reference-contexts: of these are contracts between: a firm, and an employer or employers (e.g., [ Nalebuff and Stiglitz, 1983a; Baiman and Demski, 1980; Banerjee and Beggs, 1989; Macho-stadler and Perez-Castrillo, 1991 ] ); a government and taxpayers (e.g., [ Caillaud et al., 1988 ] ); a landlord and a tenant (e.g., <ref> [ Arrow, 1985 ] </ref> ); an insurance company and a policy holder (e.g., [ Rubinstein and Yaari, 1983; Harris and Raviv, 1978; Spence and Zeckhauser, 1971 ] ); a buyer and a seller (e.g., [ Matthews, 1983; Myerson, 1983 ] ); a government and firms (e.g., [ McAfee and McMillan, 1986 <p> company and a policy holder (e.g., [ Rubinstein and Yaari, 1983; Harris and Raviv, 1978; Spence and Zeckhauser, 1971 ] ); a buyer and a seller (e.g., [ Matthews, 1983; Myerson, 1983 ] ); a government and firms (e.g., [ McAfee and McMillan, 1986 ] ); stockholders and managements (e.g., <ref> [ Arrow, 1985 ] </ref> ); a professional and a client [ Shavell, 1979 ] , etc. In these situations two parties are usually be found.

Reference-contexts: contracted agent has full information about the state of the world before signing the contract, then the contracting agent's expected utility is lower than in the case where it and the contracted agent have symmetric beliefs (either perfect or imperfect) about the state of the world before signing the contract <ref> [ Baiman and Demski, 1980; Demski and Sappington, 1984 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: for the slack also and if for fixed effort levels e 1 ; :::; e i , z is a monotonic function from the effort level of the rest of the contracted agents, then the contracting agent can construct a contract in which it can obtain its first best outcome <ref> [ Banerjee and Beggs, 1989 ] </ref> . The contract enables agent i, whose choice of effort level is a function of the effort levels of agents 1; :::i 1, to use its monitoring capability effectively. Another interesting situation is when a group of contracted agents can commit themselves to cooperate.

Reference-contexts: These works consider different types of contracts for different applications. Examples of these are contracts between: a firm, and an employer or employers (e.g., [ Nalebuff and Stiglitz, 1983a; Baiman and Demski, 1980; Banerjee and Beggs, 1989; Macho-stadler and Perez-Castrillo, 1991 ] ); a government and taxpayers (e.g., <ref> [ Caillaud et al., 1988 ] </ref> ); a landlord and a tenant (e.g., [ Arrow, 1985 ] ); an insurance company and a policy holder (e.g., [ Rubinstein and Yaari, 1983; Harris and Raviv, 1978; Spence and Zeckhauser, 1971 ] ); a buyer and a seller (e.g., [ Matthews, 1983; Myerson,

Reference-contexts: This means that the contracted agent cannot predict the outcome based on its private information, since the private information only provides a better estimation of what the outcome may be. One example of such a situation is as follows <ref> [ Christensen, 1981 ] </ref> . In the first stage of the interaction, the contracting agent offers the contracted agent a menu of contracts based on a message it will send and the observed outcome. The contracted agent may reject the offer or agree to it and sign a contract. <p> Note that in such situations, the contracted agent has committed itself not to leave the agreement once it has observed ~. 9 Also in this case <ref> [ Christensen, 1981 ] </ref> , the agents can concentrate on the class of contracts that induce the contracted agent to send a truthful message to the contracting agent. This is due to the fact that it has been shown [ Christensen, 1981 ] for any untruthful contracts, a truthful one can <p> agreement once it has observed ~. 9 Also in this case <ref> [ Christensen, 1981 ] </ref> , the agents can concentrate on the class of contracts that induce the contracted agent to send a truthful message to the contracting agent. This is due to the fact that it has been shown [ Christensen, 1981 ] for any untruthful contracts, a truthful one can be found in which the expected utility of the agents is the same. <p> do not play an important role, since the contracted agent cares only about how the contracting agent's type will affect its behavior in the implementation of the mechanism, but no more than that. 5.6 Value of Information and Communication There are two important questions related to situations of Asymmetric information <ref> [ Melumad and Reichelstein, 1989; Christensen, 1981 ] </ref> : 1. Will the contracting agent always be better off, the more the contracted agent knows about the world? 2. Is communication beneficial to the contracting agent. <p> The contracted agent may use its additional information in two ways: it may use its information to shirk, thereby reducing the benefits for the contracting agents, or it may use the information to improve the outcome (see two demonstrating examples in <ref> [ Christensen, 1981 ] </ref> ). Any additional information gained by the contracting agent after a contract is reached is only valuable if it is influenced by the choices made by the contracted agent [ Gjesdal, 1982 ] .

Reference-contexts: in Distributed Problem Solving also appears in the paradigm of planning for multiple agents, where a single intelligent agent (usually called the master) constructs a plan to be carried out by a group of agents (the slaves) and then hands out the pieces of the plan to the relevant individuals <ref> [ Rosenschein, 1982; Corkill, 1979; Lesser, 1990 ] </ref> . Werner [ Werner, 1988 ] presents a formal logical model for a master-slave relationship by one-way communication.

Reference-contexts: This will often cause inefficiency from the contracting agent's point of view. A useful technique in such situations is for the contracting agent to search for an optimal mechanism <ref> [ Demougin, 1989 ] </ref> as follows: the contracting agent offers the contracted agent a menu of contracts that are functions of its type (or the state of the world) and the outcome. If the contracted agent accepts the offer, it chooses a contract and announces it to the contracting agent. <p> The contracting agent can then replicate its benefits, using a single contract. Furthermore, even if the contracted agent does not have perfect information, there are many situations in which there is no value for communication <ref> [ Melumad and Reichelstein, 1989; Demougin, 1989 ] </ref> . These situations are such that the stochastic outcome is informative. If the outcome is not informative, however 11 , then communication is valuable.

Reference-contexts: contracted agent has full information about the state of the world before signing the contract, then the contracting agent's expected utility is lower than in the case where it and the contracted agent have symmetric beliefs (either perfect or imperfect) about the state of the world before signing the contract <ref> [ Baiman and Demski, 1980; Demski and Sappington, 1984 ] </ref> . <p> then * if agent B produces q B 1 , you will be paid r A i1 * if agent B produces q B 2 , you will be paid r A i2 * if agent B does not sign the contract, you will be paid r A i0 In <ref> [ Demski and Sappington, 1984 ] </ref> the maximization problem of the contracting agent was stated. It restricted the contracted agent's output choices to be a Bayes-Nash equilibrium, given that they are guaranteed at least their reservation price (conditional on their private information). This is done for l = A; B. <p> The outcome for the contracting agent if they choose that level of effort however, is low <ref> [ Demski and Sappington, 1984 ] </ref> . <p> Of course the contracting agent will definitely be worse off. It was suggested in <ref> [ Demski and Sappington, 1984 ] </ref> to strengthen the incentive constraints of one contracted agent so that its chosen strategy will provide a better outcome for the contracting agent. But although this method does guarantee a unique equilibrium, it is also costly to the contracting agent.

Reference-contexts: There is no uncertainty however, concerning the results of the contracted agent's actions, i.e., the outcome is a function of the contracted agent's effort. If this function is known to both agents, the contracting agent can offer the contracted agent a forcing contract <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1978; Raizsmusen, 1989; Douglas, 1989 ] </ref> . This contract means that the contracting agent will pay the contracted agent only if it provides the outcome required by the contracting agent.

Reference-contexts: In DPS, on the other hand, there are no implicit conflicts among the agents, and it is assumed that it is in the agents' interest to help one another. This help can be in the form of sharing tasks, results, or information <ref> [ Durfee, 1992 ] </ref> . In task sharing, an agent which cannot fulfill a task on its own, will attempt to pass the task, in whole or in part, to other agents, usually on a contractual basis [ Smith and Davis, 1983 ] .

Reference-contexts: The main problem for a master is not to convince other agents to carry out the plan appropriately without its supervision, but rather finding the best plan and synchronizing the agent's actions. The simple master/slaves model was extended by Ephrati and Rosenschein <ref> [ Ephrati and Rosenschein, 1993 ] </ref> to allow the "slaves" more freedom in 5 carrying out the plans. However, the slaves' main goal is still to satisfy their master's wishes.

Reference-contexts: In most of the situations we also presented procedures that can be used for solving these maximization problems by the contracting agent. Currently, there are several optimization computer packages (e.g., Nag [ Nag, 1991 ] ) available using all sorts of practical optimization methods <ref> [ Fletcher, 1987 ] </ref> that can be used for automating those procedures. The designer of the automated agent should build an interface between the chosen package and its agent's software. The contracted agents computational task is easier.

Reference-contexts: Decision theory offers a formalism for capturing risk attitudes. If an agent's utility function is concave, it is risk averse. If the function is convex, it is risk prone, and a linear utility function yields risk neutral behavior <ref> [ French, 1986 ] </ref> . We propose that a utility function of an automated agent in our contracting multiagent (CMA) environment depends on the agent's monetary gain and effort.

Reference-contexts: There are even situations when less information by the contracting agent is preferred to more <ref> [ Gjesdal, 1982 ] </ref> . As we explained in Section 5.1, when the contracted agent has full private information before signing the contract, the contracting agent's expected utility is lower than if they have symmetric beliefs. <p> Any additional information gained by the contracting agent after a contract is reached is only valuable if it is influenced by the choices made by the contracted agent <ref> [ Gjesdal, 1982 ] </ref> . The disadvantage of communications is that the "self-selection" constraint can sometimes be very restrictive, so that the information received by the contracting agent is not beneficial.

Reference-contexts: However, if the utility functions for the agents are carefully chosen, an algorithm does exist. 15 Suppose the contracted agent is risk averse and the contracting agent is risk neutral (the methods are also applicable when both are risk averse). Grossman and Hart <ref> [ Grossman and Hart, 1983 ] </ref> presented a three-steps procedure to find appropriate contracts in such situations. The first step of the procedure is to find for each possible effort level, the set of reward contracts that will induce the contracted agent to choose that particular effort level. <p> contracting agent should solve is: M aximize r 1 ;:::r n n X -(^e; q i )(q i r i ) (8) with the constraints: (IR) 1 10 2e) 1 (9) (IC) ^e = argmax e2f1;2g 2 X -(e; q i )(17 r i Using Grossman and Hart's three-steps procedure <ref> [ Grossman and Hart, 1983 ] </ref> requires that the contracting agent first determine the minimal reward needed to make the contracted agent choose e 1 = 1 and what the minimal rewards is that will make it choose e 2 = 2: C (e 1 ) = M inimize r 1

Reference-contexts: The contracting model that we present in this paper usually requires only one round of exchanging messages, but requires intensive computation, and therefore, is more appropriate when communication is expensive and computation resources are available. Contracting in multi-agent systems was previously studied in <ref> [ Grosz and Kraus, 1993 ] </ref> . A formal definition of the mental state of an agent (or a group of agents) that would like to contract out one of its tasks was presented. <p> Contracting depends mainly on an agent believe that by taking some action (and thus bringing about a certain state of affairs), it can get another agent to perform an action. However, a detailed algorithm for finding the "motivating" action and the appropriate contracted agent is not presented in <ref> [ Grosz and Kraus, 1993 ] </ref> . The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of techniques for identifying possible contracted agents and to drafting beneficial contracts (i.e., the "motivations" action). 6 3 Multiagent Framework for Contracting In the environments that we discuss, there are two types of agents.

Reference-contexts: There is no uncertainty however, concerning the results of the contracted agent's actions, i.e., the outcome is a function of the contracted agent's effort. If this function is known to both agents, the contracting agent can offer the contracted agent a forcing contract <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1978; Raizsmusen, 1989; Douglas, 1989 ] </ref> . This contract means that the contracting agent will pay the contracted agent only if it provides the outcome required by the contracting agent. <p> There is the possibility that the contracted agent may gain more information about the world during or after completing the task, but only after signing the contract and choosing the effort level. The contracting agent can not gain more information about the world. Following <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1978 ] </ref> , we also assume that there is a set of possible outcomes to the contracted agent carrying out the task Outcome = fq 1 ; :::; q n g such that q 1 &lt; q 2 &lt; ::: &lt; q n depends upon the state <p> the outcome is a function of the state of the world and the contracted agent's effort level, and in which the probabilistic function gives the probability of the state of the world which is independent of the contracted agent's effort level is a special case of the model described here. <ref> [ Page, 1987; Ross, 1973; Harris and Raviv, 1978 ] </ref> . 14 Equation (1) states that the contracting agent tries to choose the reward to the contracted agent so as to maximize its expected utility subject to two constraints.

Reference-contexts: The main question is however, whether using such monitoring is beneficial. It has been shown that if the contracted agent is risk neutral, there are no gains (to either agent) from the use of any monitoring mechanism <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1979 ] </ref> . <p> Otherwise, it will receive less preferred, fixed rewards <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1979 ] </ref> . To demonstrate this idea we use a modification of an example that appears in [ Harris and Raviv, 1979 ] . <p> Otherwise, it will receive less preferred, fixed rewards <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1979 ] </ref> . To demonstrate this idea we use a modification of an example that appears in [ Harris and Raviv, 1979 ] . <p> This is higher than in Example 4.2, where its expected outcome there is 6 3 4 . We would like to consider the option of monitoring in such situations. It was proved in <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1979 ] </ref> that if the contracted agent is risk neutral, and if it is able to get information about the exact state of the world after signing the agreement, then monitoring is not valuable.

Reference-contexts: If the contracted agent chooses a level of effort e and the state of the world is , then the outcome will be f (e; ) <ref> [ Harris and Townsend, 1981 ] </ref> . As in previous cases the contracted agent's utility function (U ced (e; r)) increases with the reward it gets from the contracting agent (r) and decreasing with its effort (e). <p> We assume that the utility function of the contracted agent can be written as a function of q and r as follows: U ced (q; r) = r e (q; ) where f (e (q; ); ) = q. In such situations the optimal strategy for the contracting agent <ref> [ Harris and Townsend, 1981 ] </ref> is to design at most 25 D distinct contracts from which the contracted agent can make a binding choice by sending a message to the contracting agent.

Reference-contexts: In specific cases, an agent's strategy may belong to two equilibria.

When there are several stages of the interaction among the agents, we use the concept of perfect equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: There are two main ways to convince another self-motivated agent to perform a task that is not among its tasks: by threatening to interfere with the agent carrying out its own tasks, or by promising rewards <ref> [ Kraus et al., 1993 ] </ref> . This paper concentrates on subcontracting by rewards which may be in two forms. The first approach is a bartering system, where one agent may promise to help the other with its future tasks in return for current help.

Reference-contexts: The contracted agent therefore has a motivation to adjust its effort over time as a function of its previous performance. As a result of this phenomenon, the optimal contracts in such situations will not be a simple function of the average outcomes <ref> [ Lambert, 1983 ] </ref> in general. This type of behavior also arises when the number of encounters is very large. However, such behavior will eventually be detected.

This type of behavior also arises when the number of encounters is very large. However, such behavior will eventually be detected. The problem of subcontracting when the number of repeated encounters is small is considered in [ Lambert, 1983 ] . It is assumed that the contracting agent can commit itself before the first encounter to a long term contract that will be implemented during all their encounters. <p> The outcome of each encounter depends on the contracted agent's effort level (which is unobservable to the contracting agent) and the state of the world in that encounter, which is not known to either agent, as in Section 4.2. Suppose there are only two encounters <ref> [ Lambert, 1983 ] </ref> and before the first encounter the contracting agent offers a binding contract. The reward in the first encounter depends upon the outcome of that encounter, but the reward of the second encounter depends upon the outcomes of the first and second encounters. <p> It was shown in <ref> [ Lambert, 1983 ] </ref> that the rewards in the second encounter should be an increasing function of the outcome of the first encounter. 7 Subcontracting to a Group Suppose that the task the contracting agent wants to contract can be performed by a group of agents.

Reference-contexts: in Distributed Problem Solving also appears in the paradigm of planning for multiple agents, where a single intelligent agent (usually called the master) constructs a plan to be carried out by a group of agents (the slaves) and then hands out the pieces of the plan to the relevant individuals <ref> [ Rosenschein, 1982; Corkill, 1979; Lesser, 1990 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The US robot, however, does not know either levels. Suppose there are only two agents, A and B, and two output function f l (e l ; l ); l = A; B <ref> [ Ma et al., 1988 ] </ref> . Then we also assume that l can be l 1 or l 2 (i.e., the world can be in four different states with two possibilities for each variable). <p> A typical contract that can be offered by the contracting agent to agent A in this case, is of the following form <ref> [ Ma et al., 1988 ] </ref> : You may choose to produce either q A 1 or q A 2 . Your reward, r A will depend not only on your output, but also on what agent B will produce. <p> But although this method does guarantee a unique equilibrium, it is also costly to the contracting agent. Another costless method of making the contracted agents choose the "correct" strategies was suggested in <ref> [ Ma et al., 1988 ] </ref> . This method, however, makes the contracts more compli cated. <p> The additional * is costless to agent A, but it can be used as a signal to the contracting agent, e.g., "From my perspective, the probability that B is choosing q B 1 is at least s A 1 +*." A detailed mechanism based on this idea is described in <ref> [ Ma et al., 1988 ] </ref> and proves that it provides a unique equilibrium that guarantees the contracting agent its second best outcome. 7.1.2 Contracted agent's effort influences others In this section we consider situations where the output of a contracted agent depends both on its level of effort and the

Reference-contexts: The contracting agent may then appeal to the other agents for verification. We will consider the case where there are only two contracted agents <ref> [ Ma, 1988 ] </ref> denoted by A and B. <p> It was shown in <ref> [ Ma, 1988 ] </ref> that the following strategies form a unique perfect equilibrium of the described mechanism: Agent A chooses e fl a at Stage 1, and at Stage 2 reports honestly, whatever action pair was chosen at Stage 1. <p> In addition, given that the contracted agents report honestly, the rewards will motivate them to choose the required actions. These results can easily be extended to the case of more than two contracted agents <ref> [ Ma, 1988 ] </ref> . In the case that actions are only privately observed, it is not possible to implement the results of perfect supervision (i.e., the first best contract, where the result is that the contracting agent observes the contracted agents' actions). <p> It is possible however, that the contracted 42 agents may be better off (given the suggested rewards) if they all deviated from the required actions. In <ref> [ Ma, 1988 ] </ref> a multi-stage mechanism is presented that makes the contracted agents choose the appropriate actions of the second best contract. 7.2 Individual Outcome is Not Observed There are other situations in which the contracting agent cannot observe the individual outcome (or such an outcome does not exist), but

Reference-contexts: An even more efficient result may be obtained if the contracted agents work as a team and 43 share the outcome. Such a situation may occur, for example, if all the contracted agents are German robots, that have the same general task to maximize Germany's profits <ref> [ Macho-stadler and Perez-Castrillo, 1991 ] </ref> . 8 Conclusions In this paper we presented techniques that can be used in different cases where contracting of a task by an agent to another agent or a set of agents in non-collaborative environments is beneficial.

Reference-contexts: new contract is agreed upon by the agents. 6.1 Short Term Contracts Repetition of the encounters between the contracting and the contracted agents enables the agents to reach efficient short term contracts if the number of encounters is large enough and if the contracted agent can be "punished" sufficiently severely <ref> [ Radner, 1981; Radner, 1985; Malcomson and Spinnewyn, 1988 ] </ref> . Based on the average outcome, the contracting agent could form an accurate estimate of the contracted agent's effort over time.

Reference-contexts: The "benevolent" agents are also taken into account in Malone's refinement of the 4 contract-net protocol. The refined protocol is based on a more sophisticated economic model <ref> [ Malone et al., 1988 ] </ref> , proving optimal behavior under certain conditions. Similar to the original Contract Net protocol, also in this model there is no need to motivate the agents to bid or to make decisions in order to maximize the global expected utility of the system.

Reference-contexts: One possibility is as follows <ref> [ Maskin and Tirole, 1990 ] </ref> : there are up to four possible stages in an interaction. 1. <p> As in previous cases, the agents can limit themselves to honest reports. In situations where the exact type of the contracting agent does not directly influence the contracted agent's utilities, it was shown <ref> [ Maskin and Tirole, 1990; Myerson, 1983 ] </ref> that the contracting agent can profit from the contracted agent's incomplete information. The intuition behind these results is as follows; When the contracting agent proposes a contract, it does it subject to two types of constraints. <p> contracting agent to suggest a menu of contracts to the contracted agent and ask it to send a message informing it of the current state of the world, or will it be better off offering only a single contract based only on the jointly observed outcome? 10 Maskin and Tirole <ref> [ Maskin and Tirole, 1990 ] </ref> show that any equilibrium of the mechanism design presented here can be computed as a Walrasian equilibrium of fictitious economy. In this economy, the traders are the different types of contracting agent.

In this economy, the traders are the different types of contracting agent. For more technical and formal details see [ Maskin and Tirole, 1990 ] . The second question is essential when communication is costly to the contracting agent. Intuitively, it seems that both communications and a knowledgeable contracted agent will allow for more efficient contracting.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, any contracting agent, regardless of its type, should offer the same mechanism. 10 Cases in which the contracting agent's private information influences the contracted agent's utilities are more complex <ref> [ Maskin and Tirole, 1992 ] </ref> . In such situations it is no longer true that, without loss of generality, the contracting agent can postpone revealing its type until the third stage of the interaction.

Reference-contexts: do not play an important role, since the contracted agent cares only about how the contracting agent's type will affect its behavior in the implementation of the mechanism, but no more than that. 5.6 Value of Information and Communication There are two important questions related to situations of Asymmetric information <ref> [ Melumad and Reichelstein, 1989; Christensen, 1981 ] </ref> : 1. Will the contracting agent always be better off, the more the contracted agent knows about the world? 2. Is communication beneficial to the contracting agent. <p> The contracting agent can then replicate its benefits, using a single contract. Furthermore, even if the contracted agent does not have perfect information, there are many situations in which there is no value for communication <ref> [ Melumad and Reichelstein, 1989; Demougin, 1989 ] </ref> . These situations are such that the stochastic outcome is informative. If the outcome is not informative, however 11 , then communication is valuable. <p> In such situations, the value of communication results from rewards to the contracted agent. There are, of course, situations where the contracting agent can use the information gathered in the menu contracts for other purposes (e.g., later contracts with other agents). 11 See <ref> [ Melumad and Reichelstein, 1989 ] </ref> for exact conditions. 30 In such a case, it may prefer the menu of contracts, even if it cannot benefit in the current interaction. 5.7 Several Contracted Agents Compete for the Job There may be a situation where there are several agents in the environment,

Reference-contexts: (e.g., if there is perfect correlation between the i s), and the possible "punishments" the contracting agent can impose on the "shrinking" contracted agents, the contracting agent may gain similar expected utility as in the case where it can observe the agents' effort levels (i.e., as in a first-best contract) <ref> [ Mookherjee, 1984 ] </ref> . In some situations, however, the contracts found by the above maximization problem may fail to uniquely implement the contracting agent's preferred actions, as in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: One of the useful results in this area is that without loss of generality it is enough to consider only contracts in which it is in the interest of the contracted agent to honestly report its type <ref> [ Myerson, 1982 ] </ref> . <p> The rewards to the chosen contracted agent depend upon the contracted agent's reported type and the observed outcome. As in previous cases, the contracting agent can use, with out loss of generality, contracts in which the agents report their types honestly <ref> [ Myerson, 1982 ] </ref> . An important aspect in the design of the contracts is the marginal return to the contracting agent by increasing the probability that a specific type (e.g., z i ) will be chosen.

Reference-contexts: In most of the situations we also presented procedures that can be used for solving these maximization problems by the contracting agent. Currently, there are several optimization computer packages (e.g., Nag <ref> [ Nag, 1991 ] </ref> ) available using all sorts of practical optimization methods [ Fletcher, 1987 ] that can be used for automating those procedures. The designer of the automated agent should build an interface between the chosen package and its agent's software. The contracted agents computational task is easier.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, there are situations where an agent in [ Sandholm, 1993 ] is forced to accept a non beneficial contract. We assume on the other hand, that the agents are heterogeneous and self motivated. In <ref> [ Pattison et al., 1987 ] </ref> a language for specification of complex relations among agents in DPS is described. Using this language, a designer of a system can define hierarchical relationships among the agents and specify to one agent the other agents' authority on it. <p> Pattison et. al. suggested an additional mechanism of contracting to the one presented in the Contract Net protocol using focused addressing. This would mean, in addition to broadcasting requests for bids, an agent in <ref> [ Pattison et al., 1987 ] </ref> has the option of asking for help from another agent directly if it knows that the other agent can help it in its task and knows the other agent's address. In this paper, we also allow both of these addressing methods.

Reference-contexts: new contract is agreed upon by the agents. 6.1 Short Term Contracts Repetition of the encounters between the contracting and the contracted agents enables the agents to reach efficient short term contracts if the number of encounters is large enough and if the contracted agent can be "punished" sufficiently severely <ref> [ Radner, 1981; Radner, 1985; Malcomson and Spinnewyn, 1988 ] </ref> . Based on the average outcome, the contracting agent could form an accurate estimate of the contracted agent's effort over time. <p> If after several encounters the contracting agent realizes that the cumulative outcome is below a given function of the expected outcome, it should impose a big "punishment" on the contracted agent. If the function over the expected outcome is chosen carefully <ref> [ Radner, 1981 ] </ref> , the probability of imposing a "punishment" when the contracted agent is in fact carrying out the desired effort level can be made very low. Meanwhile the probability of eventually imposing the "punishment" if the agent does not do ^e is 1.0. <p> We denote the first-best solution by (^r; ^e) and the expected outcome in this case for the contracting and the contracted agent by ^v and ^x respectively.

Reference-contexts: There is no uncertainty however, concerning the results of the contracted agent's actions, i.e., the outcome is a function of the contracted agent's effort. If this function is known to both agents, the contracting agent can offer the contracted agent a forcing contract <ref> [ Harris and Raviv, 1978; Raizsmusen, 1989; Douglas, 1989 ] </ref> . This contract means that the contracting agent will pay the contracted agent only if it provides the outcome required by the contracting agent. <p> The contracting agent's problem is to find a contract that will maximize the contracting agent's expected utility, knowing that the contracted agent may reject the contract or, even if it accepts the contract the effort level will be chosen later <ref> [ Raizsmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . The contracting agent's reward to the contracted agent can be based only on the outcome. <p> Let us assume that in the contract that will be offered by the contracting agent, for any q i i = 1; :::; n; the contracting agent will pay the contracted agent the reward r i .

Reference-contexts: A modified version of the Contract Net protocol for competitive agents in the transportation domain is presented in <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> . It provides a formalization of the bidding and awarding decision process based on marginal cost calculating on local agent criteria. <p> A simple motivation technique is presented to convince agents to make bids; the actual price of a contract is half way between the price mentioned in the task announcement and the bid price. In contrast to our framework, it is assumed in <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> that all agents centrally designed will carry out their contracted tasks efficiently and without monitoring. Furthermore, there are situations where an agent in [ Sandholm, 1993 ] is forced to accept a non beneficial contract. <p> In contrast to our framework, it is assumed in <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> that all agents centrally designed will carry out their contracted tasks efficiently and without monitoring.

Reference-contexts: Contracting, in particular, was previously used in the Distributed Problem Solvers framework for tasks allocation. In the Contract Net protocol <ref> [ Smith and Davis, 1981; Smith and Davis, 1983 ] </ref> , a contract is an explicit agreement between an agent that generates a task (the manager) and an agent that is willing to execute the task (the contractor).

Reference-contexts: In task sharing, an agent which cannot fulfill a task on its own, will attempt to pass the task, in whole or in part, to other agents, usually on a contractual basis <ref> [ Smith and Davis, 1983 ] </ref> . This approach assumes that agents not otherwise occupied will readily take on the task. Similarly, results and information are shared among agents in such environments with no expectation of reciprocation [ Lesser and Erman, 1980; Lesser, 1991; Conry et al., 1990 ] . <p> Contracting, in particular, was previously used in the Distributed Problem Solvers framework for tasks allocation.

Reference-contexts: Negotiation is the main paradigm that is used for coordination and task distribution in multi-agent systems (MA) where agents are self motivated. While contracting is most appropriate for a hierarchical relationship, negotiation is most appropriate when all agents are on the same level. For example, Sycara <ref> [ Sycara, 1990; Sycara, 1987 ] </ref> presents a model of negotiation that combines case-based reasoning and optimization of the multi-attributed utilities.

However, the slaves' main goal is still to satisfy their master's wishes. Wellman <ref> [ Wellman, 1992 ] </ref> proposes the use of market price mechanisms for coordination and task distribution in distributed planning systems.
