Title: The Bakery Algorithm: Yet Another Specification and Verification  
Author: Egon B orger Yuri Gurevich Dean Rosenzweig 
Abstract: In a meeting at Schloss Dagstuhl in June 1993, Uri Abraham and Menachem Magidor have challenged the thesis that an evolving algebra can be tailored to any algorithm at its own abstraction level. As example they gave an instructive proof which uses lower and higher views to show correctness of Lamport's bakery algorithm. We construct two evolving algebras capturing lower and higher view respectively, enabling a simple and concise proof of correctness for the bakery algorithm. x

Reference-contexts: Introduction Uri Abraham <ref> [Abraham93] </ref> has devised an instructive correctness proof for various variants of Lamport's bakery algorithm relying on a distinction between a lower view and a higher view of the algorithms. Actions at the higher level represents complex lower level computations. <p> In order to make the paper technically self contained, except for basic notions about evolving algebras of [Gurevich91], we start Section 1 with a review of Lamport's 1979 algorithm and give full details of proofs also in those places where we borrow from <ref> [Abraham93] </ref>. 1 The algorithms This section presents Lamport's algorithm (taken in a form which is adapted from [Abraham93]), the corresponding `lower level' evolving algebra, and the more abstract evolving algebra reflecting the `higher level view'. 1.1 Lamport's algorithm For arbitrary but fixed N let P 1 ; : : : ; <p> for basic notions about evolving algebras of [Gurevich91], we start Section 1 with a review of Lamport's 1979 algorithm and give full details of proofs also in those places where we borrow from <ref> [Abraham93] </ref>. 1 The algorithms This section presents Lamport's algorithm (taken in a form which is adapted from [Abraham93]), the corresponding `lower level' evolving algebra, and the more abstract evolving algebra reflecting the `higher level view'. 1.1 Lamport's algorithm For arbitrary but fixed N let P 1 ; : : : ; P N be processes that may want from time to time to access a `critical section' CS <p> This ordering will help us to formalize the idea that tickets increase together with doorways (see C1 below). This should also apply in a way to overlapping doorways; these are ordered by the following relation OE, borrowed from <ref> [Abraham93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: At a seminar in Schloss Dagstuhl in June 1993 Uri Abraham and Men-achem Magidor have expressed doubts that such a proof could be naturally carried out in the evolving algebra framework of <ref> [Gurevich91] </ref>, since the latter uses a notion of atomic instantaneous action. We construct, in Section 1, two evolving algebras, reflecting the lower and higher views of Lamport's improved version of the bakery algorithm (see [Lamport79]). fl Dipartimento di Informatica, Universita di Pisa, Corso Italia 40, I-56100 Pisa, boerger@di.unipi.it. <p> The correctness proof however remains essentially the same. In order to make the paper technically self contained, except for basic notions about evolving algebras of <ref> [Gurevich91] </ref>, we start Section 1 with a review of Lamport's 1979 algorithm and give full details of proofs also in those places where we borrow from [Abraham93]. 1 The algorithms This section presents Lamport's algorithm (taken in a form which is adapted from [Abraham93]), the corresponding `lower level' evolving algebra, and <p> We introduce for this purpose an external function T whose values are determined dynamically by the outside world, cf. <ref> [Gurevich91] </ref>. The relevant moment to be analyzed is the moment at which a process which has received a ticket is allowed to enter the critical section. This `permission to go' will also be represented by an external function, Go.

Reference-contexts: (X) then mode (X) := CS 6 Exit if mode (X) = CS then mode (X) := done Finale if mode (X) = done then mode (X) := satisfied, R (X) := 0 2 Atomic actions interpretation 2.1 Semantics of B 1 We rely on the notion of run of <ref> [Gurevich94] </ref>, specialized to real time. This means that we shall speak of a move (rule execution) taking place at moment a. Since we consider atomic actions here, we assume moves to take zero time. <p> An agent is atomic if all its moves are so. 3 If an agent X makes an atomic move and P () = (a; b) then S b (X) is the result of executing one step of X at S a (X). (See <ref> [Gurevich94] </ref> for the definition of the result of a one-step execution of a sequential evolving algebra at a given state.) 4 All customers are atomic. All Check moves of readers are atomic. All Read moves of any r (X; Y ) are atomic with respect to mode (X).

Reference-contexts: Refining the abstract conditions for the case of regular reads (see [Lamport86]), we show that the proof of the previous section goes through with only slight modifications. For the more general case of safe registers correctness of the algorithm from <ref> [Lamport74] </ref> is then easily proved by a slight adaptation of the present argument|the improved algorithm from [Lamport79] is not correct for safe registers, as shown by a simple counterexample. <p> writes ticket 18 to R [X] and the array 12.30-12.35: X reads R [Y ] getting 117 (by overlap) 12.45-12.50: Y reads 18 from R [X] 13.00: X and Y both go to CS It is however easy to adapt the present proof to show correctness of the algorithm of <ref> [Lamport74] </ref> for safe registers, rephrased as an appropriate evolving algebra, using the same abstract conditions C0-C3.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we explain the semantics of evolving algebras assuming durative actions, actions taking time, and allowing overlapping of reads and writes to shared registers. Refining the abstract conditions for the case of regular reads (see <ref> [Lamport86] </ref>), we show that the proof of the previous section goes through with only slight modifications.
