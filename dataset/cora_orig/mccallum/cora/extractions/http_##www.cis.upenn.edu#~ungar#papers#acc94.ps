Abstract: After a brief review of some statistical approaches to multivariate process control, we present a technique for determining root causes when information is available on likely out of control scenarios or fault types. We utilize linear dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis or partial least squares to limit the number of latent variables to study. While using historical in control data is important in establishing control means and limits, these data often have less structure for dimension reduction than do data which come from known fault types. If these latter data are available, the expanded data set can be analyzed for dimension reduction, using the in control data to set limits in the reduced set. When a sequence of points is then seen to be beyond the control limits, the distance to the nearest known fault type is measured. If the dimensions can be reduced to two, these can be plotted as well. The new problem is classified into one of the existing fault types when its distance to it becomes smaller than a pre-specified criterion. If it remains out of control, but fails to approach an existing fault type, a new fault paradigm is created. Our approach is demonstrated on a simulated chemical process.

Reference-contexts: This redundancy can be exploited to reduce the dimensionality of the monitoring problem. In such a case, dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares (PLS) can be employed to significantly simplify the problem. See, for example, MacGregor et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, Piovoso et al.[2], or Mejdell and Skogestad [3].

See, for example, MacGregor et al. [1], Piovoso et al.[2], or Mejdell and Skogestad <ref> [3] </ref>. While this facilitates detection of an out of control process, it complicates the root cause analysis, because it is often unclear on which original variable (s) the new point is out of control, and hence what action needs to be taken to correct the problem.

Reference-contexts: The first PCA direction is the linear com bination of the X's that has maximum variance: b pc = argmax var (Xb): jjbjj = 1 (See <ref> [4] </ref> for an excellent introduction to PCA.) Subsequent directions are found by finding the next linear combination orthogonal to the first direction that has the highest variance. The process can be continued until all p directions (linear combinations) are found, where p is the number of X variables.

Reference-contexts: Often, this value k is found by cross-validation, a method by which a part of the data set is used to estimate k and another part used to test the procedure (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>). However, most of the emphasis of cross-validation is concerned with prediction. For our purposes, we are simply looking to find a reasonably small k that will contain most of the variance of X.

Reference-contexts: Wold ([6]) for applications to the social sciences. It has since been used extensively by chemometricians, and much of the development has taken place in the chemometric literature. There are a number of different algorithms to calculate the direction of PLS. Recently, Hoskuldsson <ref> [7] </ref> has shown that PLS forms a compromise between the direction searches of OLS and PCA. (See also [8].) PLS finds its directions by choosing the linear combinations of both the X's and Y's that have the maximal covariance of any such linear combinations.

Reference-contexts: Control limits on T 2 are set from the historical in control data. For a point out of control, plots showing the contribution of the various process variables can be derived. See Miller et al. <ref> [11] </ref> for further details. If information on various fault types is available, however, one can classify the new problem based on the distance to the fault. In two dimensions, an example is shown in figure 3. Here, the data are again plotted in the first two PLS directions over time. <p> Appropriate action is then taken. If the distance to all is greater than a prespecified criterion, a new fault type is proposed. In this case, contribution plots <ref> [11] </ref> can be used to determine the contributions of the latent or original process variables to the new fault type. 4. Conclusion We have reviewed some statistical approaches based on dimension reduction for multivariate process control.
