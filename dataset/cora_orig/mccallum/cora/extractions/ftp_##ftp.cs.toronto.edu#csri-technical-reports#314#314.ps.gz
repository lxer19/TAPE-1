Reference-contexts: include NP's formed out of complex determiners like `an even number of' which are not monotone.) Among the quantifiers we have defined, every (s), some (s), atleast k (s), and most (s) are monotone increasing quantifiers, while no (s) and atmost k (s) are monotone decreasing for any s; see <ref> (Barwise and Cooper, 1981) </ref>. Barwise and Cooper also give the following properties of monotone quantifiers: the complement operators (except the dual) map a monotone quantifier into one of inverse polarity (from increasing to decreasing, or vice-versa), while the dual operator preserves the polarity (since it is switched twice). <p> The last class of determiners, D SYM , has also been studied extensively <ref> (Barwise and Cooper, 1981) </ref>. It corresponds to determiners that are symmetric, those for which the restriction set can be interchanged with the set quantified (t 2 D (s) () s 2 D (t)). <p> Naturally, the method should be generalized to handle negative contexts. 69 Part IV Appendices 70 Appendix A Proofs: Generalized Quantifiers A.1 Basic properties The following equivalences and properties follow directly from the definitions and are easy to check <ref> (Barwise and Cooper, 1981) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: R 1 = parent-of ffi some1 (child fi U ) 2. Every parent of a child is happy. U fi U = (U fi happy) ffi every R 1 52 6.2 Anaphora We now focus on the mechanism used for anaphora, for which we use Hirst's definition <ref> (Hirst, 1981, p. 4) </ref>. Anaphora is the device of making in discourse an abbreviated to some entity (or entities) in the expectation that the perceiver of the discourse will be able to dis-abbreviate the reference and thereby determine the identity of the entity.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, it might be used for the study inference in ERA. (In appendix D, we give some properties of the AGQ logic.) 7.3 Comparison with other formal languages In this section, we compare ERA (and the AGQ logic) to other logics, namely, the Montagovian syntax <ref> (McAllester and Givan, 1992) </ref>, description logics, and Purdy's L N (1991; 1992a; 1992b). The comparison is done on the quantifying structure of the different logics. Quantification serves to join two relations 2 of arbitrary arity ( 1) around one of their arguments (see equation (7.10) written in Moore's notation (1981)).

Reference-contexts: In chapter 2, we present the theory of generalized quantifiers proposed by Barwise and Cooper (1981) for the study of quantification in natural language. The appeal of this theory is due to its conformity to the notion that each syntactic unit in natural language has a semantic counterpart <ref> (Montague, 1974) </ref>. In particular, its prevalent semantic units are the quantifiers, defined as families of sets, whose natural language counterparts are the simple NP's (simple noun phrases), like `a man' , `most men' , and `every man' . <p> By doing so, the meaning of a simple NP (a naked NP|without a possessive, a prepositional phrase, or a relative clause) corresponds to a single semantic unit|a generalized quantifier|hence preserving the syntactic structure at the semantic level, as motivated by the principle of compositionality <ref> (Montague, 1974) </ref>. The preservation of the syntax is justified by an intuitive sense that language is closely related to the way we think. Therefore, the closer a representation follows language, the more likely it is to have similar properties.

Reference-contexts: The operators are defined with respect to Moore's notation <ref> (Moore, 1981) </ref> presented in chapter 2. Note that D can be any determiner from `some' , `every' , `no' , `at least k' , `at most k' , `exactly k' , `most' , etc.

Reference-contexts: The problem worsens with `most' , as even reformulation seems impossible for sentence (7.13) even though `most' is modeled in <ref> (Purdy, 1992a) </ref>. (7.13) Every man loves most of his children. In the variable-free Montagovian syntax (or the BGQ logic), R is a unary relation, while P is either a unary relation or a binary relation; the resulting relation U is therefore a truth value or a unary relation.

Reference-contexts: The logic L N proposed by Purdy (1991; 1992a; 1992b) has exclusively unary predicates as domain of quantification. His logic is based on the monotonicity of generalized quantifiers as unifying principle, which, he shows, also permits him to account for mass terms <ref> (Purdy, 1992b) </ref>. Also, Purdy is a proponent of surface reasoning, which requires every single inference to be directly expressible in natural language. He shows how to relate L N to English. However, anaphora is not covered by his semantic interpretation process.
