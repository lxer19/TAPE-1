Abstract: This paper discusses the role of culture in the evolution of cognitive systems. We define culture as any information transmitted between individuals and between generations by non-genetic means. Experiments are presented that use genetic programming systems that include special mechanisms for cultural transmission of information. These systems evolve computer programs that perform cognitive tasks including mathematical function mapping and action selection in a virtual world. The data show that the presence of culture-supporting mechanisms can have a clear beneficial impact on the evolvability of correct programs. The implications that these results may have for cognitive science are briefly discussed.

Reference-contexts: In particular, results are presented for genetic programming systems, in which executable computer programs are automatically produced through processes of recombination and natural selection <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>. Genetic programming systems can automatically produce computer programs for a variety of interesting cognitive tasks including circuit design, grammar induction, block stacking, and action selection (Koza, 1992; Spector, 1994, 1996). <p> Results are then presented in the form of computa 1 Bonner (1980) provides a similar definition. tional effort measurements, and the meaning and generality of the results are discussed. Method Genetic Programming Genetic programming is a technique for the automatic generation of computer programs by means of natural selection <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>. The genetic programming process starts by creating a large initial population of programs that are random combinations of elements from problem-specific function and terminal sets. <p> Details of program representation and algorithms for all genetic operators, along with full source code for genetic programming systems, can be found in <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref> and (Koza, 1994). Computational Effort Koza has developed a technique for measuring the computational effort required to solve a problem with genetic programming (Koza, 1994). Because the genetic programming algorithm includes random choices at several steps, data is collected from a large number of independent runs. <p> For the described experiments data points were obtained from the equation y = x 4 +x 3 +x 2 +x (see Figure 1), which is a standard example from the literature <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>. <p> that could be used in evolved programs were the 2-argument addition function +, the 2-argument subtraction function -, the 2-argument multiplication function *, the 2-argument protected division function %, two 1-argument trigonometric functions SIN and COS, the 1-argument exponential function EXP, and the 1-argument protected logarithm function RLOG (as in <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>). Programs could also refer to the independent variable X, and to ephemeral random constants between -1 and 1 (also as in (Koza, 1992)). <p> the 2-argument protected division function %, two 1-argument trigonometric functions SIN and COS, the 1-argument exponential function EXP, and the 1-argument protected logarithm function RLOG (as in <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>). Programs could also refer to the independent variable X, and to ephemeral random constants between -1 and 1 (also as in (Koza, 1992)). Tournament selection was used (tournament size = 5), along with a 90% crossover rate, a 10% reproduction rate, no mutation, a population size of 1000, and a maximum of 51 generations per run. Detailed descriptions of the meanings of these parameters can be found in (Koza, 1992); it suffices <p> (also as in <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>). Tournament selection was used (tournament size = 5), along with a 90% crossover rate, a 10% reproduction rate, no mutation, a population size of 1000, and a maximum of 51 generations per run. Detailed descriptions of the meanings of these parameters can be found in (Koza, 1992); it suffices here to note that these values are reasonably standard. For the runs with indexed-memory and for those with culture a 100-element memory array was added, along with READ and WRITE functions that behave as described above. <p> 100 points are awarded for obtaining the gold, there is a 1-point penalty for each action taken, and there is a 100-point penalty for each unit of distance between the agent and the gold at the end of the run. 3 Standardized fitness values (for which lower values are better <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>) are the average of the scores from the four random worlds, subtracted from 100. Agents are not explicitly rewarded for climbing out of the cave, although less action penalties are accumulated if an agent climbs out and thereby ends the simulation.

In particular, for a configuration similar to that of <ref> (Spector, 1996) </ref> it appears that ordinary indexed memory is best, followed by culture. Here we may gain insights from biological examples; not all animals use culture, and there are presumably many niches in which culture confers no adaptive advantage.

Reference-contexts: Indexed Memory Indexed memory is a mechanism that allows programs developed by genetic programming to make use of runtime memory <ref> (Teller, 1994) </ref>. The mechanism consists of a linear array of memory locations and two functions, READ and WRITE, that are added to the set of functions from which programs are created. The memory is initialized at the start of each program execution.
