Abstract: Inspired by the inventive uses of the fictional product of transportable holes demonstrated in several animated cartoons, we have endeavored to create a environment that allows us to create windows within our virtual worlds. These windows open the often closed environments of head-mounted displays to the richness of the physical world that surrounds us. We have created a video-based stereo see-through head-mounted display to enable the merging of 3D windows onto reality. We describe the many obstacles to merging stereo images generated by a computer graphics system and views of the physical environment. While this paper describes only a single implementation, the issues remain general to anyone intending to construct a similar environment and the motivation is not implementation specific. We point out obstacles, solutions, work-arounds, and other issues for others wishing to attain the same goal. We also discuss the advantages of adding familiar of physical input devices to virtual environments.
