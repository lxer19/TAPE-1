Abstract: In this paper we present a sequential algorithm that computes the part of a set of parallel line segments visible in a direction. The algorithm performs in O(n log n) time and O(n) time with preprocessing-sorting, where n is the number of line segments. The worst possible configuration of the line segments is determined to be a staircase arrangement with a garbage collection segment. keywords: visibility, staircase, garbage collector

Finally, in [6] a simple divide and conquer strategy is used to develop an O (n log n) algorithm that solves the skyline problem. This problem is easily reduced to the problem we are concerned in this paper.
