Title: Planning Tutorial Text in a System for Teaching English as a Second Language to Deaf Learners  
Author: Lisa N. Michaud and Kathleen F. McCoy

Abstract: In this paper we discuss an envisioned text planner for a computer-assisted instruction tool for deaf learners of English. We describe the problem of deaf literacy and overview our system, designed to act as a writing tutor that generates text to explain the errors found in a user's written compositions. These explanations are created according to a response anatomy that divides the planning task into a bottom-up phase for grouping and ordering explanations and a top-down phase for building a hierarchical text plan to create the explanatory text. This is then followed by a revision of the complete plan to place it in its greater context. At all levels of planning, the explanation is personalized to the individual learner's styles and knowledge in order to maximize the learning experience.

Reference-contexts: The current implementation of ICICLE captures the basics of the error identification process. The user interacts with the system through a window-based in terface implemented in Tcl/TK. Analysis of the student's writing is performed by a bottom-up chart parser which is a successor to that in <ref> (Allen 1995) </ref>. It makes use of an English grammar augmented with mal-rules (Sleeman 1982; Weischedel, Voge, & James 1978) derived from an error taxonomy compiled out of actual writing samples from deaf students (Suri 1993; Suri & McCoy 1993).

Reference-contexts: Another obstacle to the ASL user acquiring English is the unique processing strategies he brings to the language task <ref> (Anderson 1993) </ref>. The cognitive elements used to store signs in short-term memory are distinctly different from those used with a spoken/written language. <p> difficulty for the deaf learner is that he or she has little to no understandable input in the "target" language; with poor or no aural capabilities, deaf learners receive nearly all of their English input through written material, often academic texts aimed at the comprehension level of their hearing peers <ref> (Anderson 1993) </ref>, while the consensus among most researchers in Second Language Acquisition (Krashen 1982; Tarone 1982; Vygotsky 1986; Hatch 1983) holds that second language input at or near the learner's level of existing proficiency is most beneficial for learning. <p> The second part of the content determination is the grouping and ordering of the errors. Research in language pedagogy <ref> (Anderson 1993) </ref> and empirical studies on learning from written texts (Hayes-Roth & Thorndike 1979) both suggest that grouping together related information is more effective than explaining each error in the order in which it occurs in the essay.

Reference-contexts: The result is a tutorial dialogue that is not only tailored to the learner but that also takes advantage of the dialogue history to exploit opportunities to use comparison and contrast to encourage "meaningful learning," tying new information together with recently-discussed and established knowledge <ref> (Brown 1994) </ref>. In this paper, after discussing further the motivation of the system by describing the challenges facing the deaf learner of English, we sketch an overview of the system design and describe the goals of the tutorial component.

Reference-contexts: We note here that we do not expect our user model to always be infallible or complete. Because of this, we will be following in the footsteps of (Cawsey 1990; 1993) and <ref> (Carenini & Moore 1993) </ref>, storing all decisions based on the user model in our plan as it is built. This information can be used later to recover from incorrect user model information should an explanation fail. <p> Other related work that has influenced ICICLE design choices includes the use of referring expressions to establish context described in the work on the Sherlock (Moore 1993; Rosenblum & Moore 1993) and Migraine <ref> (Carenini & Moore 1993) </ref> systems. We are greatly attracted by the idea of linking current explanations to prior explanations.

Reference-contexts: It is our belief that the composition of original text in a non-native language is a task of this level of cognitive difficulty. Sources such as <ref> (Collins & Brown 1988) </ref> emphasize the usefulness of post-performance review or reflection as an approach to learning, and stress the suitability of computer systems in this kind of task, since they can perfectly capture the user performance and then review any aspect of it.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, our model cannot leave the choice of syntactic structures to chance or to indirect constraints in a text generation component. It is our belief that FUF, a functional unification-based system <ref> (Elhadad 1993) </ref>, can be modified for work with our approach. Alternative possible syntactic structures for a given sentence would be ordered according to the acquisition model for this user. Those constructions that are at the user's learning level will be preferred by ordering them before other potential realizations.

Reference-contexts: Our system therefore endeavors to accomplish this goal and to optimize the knowledge derived from the composition experience by reviewing it with the user, an approach also found in some other language tutors such as MILT <ref> (Kaplan & Holland 1995) </ref>. While providing this tutorial feedback, ICICLE endeavors to satisfy the deaf learner's need for understandable input as mentioned above. We intend for our system's generated text to use grammatical constructions that involve those aspects of English the student is currently attempting to master.

Reference-contexts: It makes no effort to build instruction around an overall plan to facilitate learning (see (Oxford 1995; Levy 1997; Kaplan & Holland 1995)). Also, the canned explanations leave no recourse if they are ineffective or if the student is not sufficiently motivated or knowledgeable to make the correction (see <ref> (Loritz 1995) </ref>). Finally, these limited explanations are entirely inflexible; they cannot be tailored to the user's level of expertise, they do not take into account the context of previous explanations that is so vital to human explanation, and they contain no comparison or contrast between similar errors.

Reference-contexts: The entry into the cycle occurs when the user inputs a piece of writing (either directly typed into the system, or through loading a prepared text file) for the system to analyze. With the help of the user model, the system identifies the errors in the text <ref> (McCoy, Pennington, & Suri 1996) </ref> and then trims the list of errors down to those relevant for tutoring. The determination of relevance relies on the model's representation of those language features which are above, below, and at the user's current understanding.

Reference-contexts: We have based the top-down, hierarchical aspect of our planner largely on the work described in <ref> (Moore & Paris 1992) </ref>, modifying the planning operators outlined there for our purposes. The Anatomy of a Response The response generation model using this planning element is designed to generate text according to an "anatomy of a response" comprised of content, method, form, and manner.

Reference-contexts: We note here that we do not expect our user model to always be infallible or complete.

This information can be used later to recover from incorrect user model information should an explanation fail. <p> Manner The primary job of the manner component is to tie new knowledge into existing knowledge. In order to do this, the manner component must now create a context-aware explanation, a process we view as a revision of the existing plan. It has been observed <ref> (Moore 1993) </ref> that comparison and contrast to recent and established material is a powerful tool of human-generated explanations, and essential for generating comprehensible tutorial discourse. At this time, therefore, the text planner needs to begin to make discourse-level adjustments to its plan in order to insert comparison goals where warranted. <p> Other related work that has influenced ICICLE design choices includes the use of referring expressions to establish context described in the work on the Sherlock (Moore 1993; Rosenblum & Moore 1993) and Migraine <ref> (Carenini & Moore 1993) </ref> systems. We are greatly attracted by the idea of linking current explanations to prior explanations.

Reference-contexts: A domain knowledge base will contain information about the errors recognized by the system and possible grouping strategies to cluster them according to shared features. Next, the order of the clusters will be determined using information on how to best structure the overall discussion flow <ref> (Oxford 1995) </ref>, completing the bottom-up phase. Method The next part of the planning process (and the first part of building the top-down plan) is selecting a tutorial method for addressing each error.
