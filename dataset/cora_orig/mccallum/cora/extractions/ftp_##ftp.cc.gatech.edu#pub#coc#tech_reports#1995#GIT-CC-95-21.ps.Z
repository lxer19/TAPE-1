Abstract: This article motivates and describes the dual timestamping methodology, a novel monitoring technique whose goal is to provide first class support for the visualization and animation of distributed and parallel applications. Central to this methodology is the use of both a primary and secondary timestamp in trace events. The primary timestamp is a logical timestamp that provides information about the concurrency of events. This information is useful for generating visualizations that depict the events as occurring in parallel. The secondary timestamp provides a normalized, causality preserving, real-time clock for use in performance visualization. The dual timestamping methodology is the basis for PVaniM, a collection of general purpose and application-specific visualizations of PVM applications. The implementation of PVaniM relies solely on macros and postprocessors. Because system modifications were not required, the PVaniM implementation strategies are general and easily adaptable to other distributed computing system domains.

Reference-contexts: Tracing utilizes sensors which are small pieces of code that are embedded within the program and that perform the desired recording of information. Although complex techniques for developing sensors exist [OSS93], simple techniques are surprisingly useful. For example, many distributed systems <ref> [Sun90, BFS + 94] </ref> supply library routines for communication, synchronization and spawning of tasks. These integral events are traced by providing macro wrappers that first perform the tracing operation and then call the desired routines.

Reference-contexts: This is due to their popularity, availability, and ability to support high-performance scientific applications in a variety of disciplines. In these environments, one must be careful because the monitoring also requires network bandwidth; this can inhibit the effectiveness of the distributed computing environment. For example, Xab <ref> [BS93] </ref>, an online tracing tool for PVM, has trouble peacefully coinciding with applications it monitors. Our ongoing research with online tracing systems has found their perturbation to be excessive and hence their tracing is unreliable. <p> It is well known that the various clocks in a distributed system cannot be perfectly synchronized and will suffer from clock drift. Effort must be made to synchronize clocks as much as possible and to guarantee anamolies such as tachyons <ref> [BS93] </ref> do not occur. Tachyons result, for instance, when when a message receive event is assigned a timestamp that is earlier than the timestamp of the send event associated with the message. <p> A rigorous postprocessor is provided that adjusts timestamps to simultaneously emulate the use of both Lamport's logical clocking and his hybrid clocking algorithm. Clock Synchronization Postprocessing Our postprocessing techniques are based on those developed for the PGPVM system [TSA94] and similar to Beguelin's work on post-processing trace events <ref> [BS93] </ref>. The PVaniM postprocessor differentiates itself by providing support for a pure logical timestamp in addition to a hybrid logical and physical timestamp. PVaniM also supports and corrects timestamps associated with custom user trace events.

Reference-contexts: When the view utilizes Lamport logical time on its X-axis, the view not only displays a communication pattern, but also enforces a consistent ordering on a computation. Consistency is an important feature for testing and debugging, and is not achievable with a global real-time timestamp <ref> [Fid94] </ref>. 2.3.3 Animations Sophisticated graphical toolkits support the ability to simultaneously animate events that are concurrent. This approach can convey critical information to the viewer, information that simply cannot be achieved with a serialized view of a parallel application.

Reference-contexts: An application-specific visualization typically can provide more information about the domain and fundamental operations of a program. These visualizations require custom trace events that are not well supported by generic trace formats such as PICL <ref> [G + 90] </ref>. <p> These stubs perform the tracing and then call the appropriate communication primitive. Our tracing produces two trace events for communication events, one before the PVM primitive and one after. This allows us to determine the duration of the communication primitive. We have adapted this approach from PICL <ref> [G + 90] </ref>. This allows us to produce trace events that contain dual timestamps as well as pertinent communication specific data. Timestamp Creation Crucial to tracing is, of course, the creation of timestamps.

One popular communication view is the Feynman view, also know as a Lamport or space-time view. In it, process numbers are listed along the Y-axis.

Reference-contexts: In the next section, we provide a brief overview of the various techniques used to visualize distributed applications. 2.3 Visualization Techniques Although visualization is still in its infancy, some general distributed computation visualization techniques are emerging. These include statistical displays, communication views, animations, and application-specific visualizations <ref> [KS93] </ref>. 2.3.1 Statistical Displays Many performance visualization systems such as ParaGraph [HE91] rely heavily on statistical displays for the presentation of performance data.

Reference-contexts: By animating the events with the same logical timestamps in parallel, we are guaranteed that the visualization produced is representative of a plausible ordering of events. Note that other feasible orderings may exist also. For example, the Animation 6 Choreographer <ref> [KS94] </ref> is a tool that truly characterizes causality by allowing the user to choose a feasible ordering of events, and the corresponding concurrent visualization will be representative of the selected ordering. 3.2 Secondary Timestamp|Synchronized wall clock time Although the Lamport primary timestamp is useful for program understanding, a synchronized wall clock

Reference-contexts: This section provides an overview of both timestamps. It then describes PVaniM, the software realization of the dual times-tamping methodology, the views it provides, and details of its implementation. 3.1 Primary Timestamp|Lamport timestamp In our methodology, all events are first ordered by a Lamport timestamp <ref> [Lam78] </ref> which is consistent with causality. Events that have the same Lamport timestamp can be thought of as concurrent events. By animating the events with the same logical timestamps in parallel, we are guaranteed that the visualization produced is representative of a plausible ordering of events. <p> Systems such as ParaGraph rely on this type of timestamp to provide its vast library of performance tuning views. As a secondary timestamp, our system provides a hybrid of physical and logical clocks as described in <ref> [Lam78] </ref> that is normalized at the beginning of application execution. This approach is also used by the PGPVM [TSA94] package. The hybrid clocking method is novel as it sychronizes clocks without setting them backwards and therefore without the risk of introducing tachyons into the system. <p> The techniques discussed in this section for performing dual timestamping can be integrated into a system using an approach similar to that used by the Conch distributed computing environment [TSS95], as all postprocessing techniques are derivatives of online distributed algorithms introduced in <ref> [Lam78] </ref>. This section provides a thorough description of our macros and postprocessing techniques. Since this approach is achievable without source code modifications, it should be readily portable to other distributed computing environments, both experimental and commercial. <p> Lamport provides algorithms for both of these that require the "piggybacking" of clock information onto messages that are sent in the distributed system <ref> [Lam78] </ref>. Integrating these types of algorithms into systems (and avoiding the need for postprocessing) clearly has several advantages [TSS95]. However, the contribution of the nonintegrated approach described in this article is that its techniques apply to distributed systems in general. <p> The timestamp of the receive event is adjusted to be the maximum of its current value (with one clock tick adjustment, if necessary) and the times-tamp of the send event plus a minimum message delay time (referred to as m in Lamport's vernacular <ref> [Lam78] </ref>). Conceptually, we take communication time into consideration when adjusting the clock, if necessary. This procedure for adjusting clocks continues until the entire graph has been traversed. <p> Nonetheless, future work will investigate if more rigorous clock synchronization can be implemented without system modifications and without causing undue perturbation to the distributed application. To summarize, we have implemented an online logical clock and a hybrid logical and physical clock adjustment algorithm, both of which are described in <ref> [Lam78] </ref> by emulating them with a postprocessor. This approach is useful when modifications to a distributed system are not a feasible option. This algorithm, coupled with buffered postmortem tracing, has yielded very satisfying results.

Reference-contexts: Without visualization, understanding the data derived from monitoring can be tedious and complex. In this section, we provide a brief background of both topics. 2.1 Monitoring Collection Techniques Monitors utilize two fundamental techniques for information collection: tracing and sampling <ref> [OSS93] </ref>. In tracing, all occurrences of events are stored for a certain interval of time. Typically, this interval is for the duration of the distributed application. In sampling, occurrences of an event are collected asynchronously, typically only at the request of the monitor. <p> In sampling, occurrences of an event are collected asynchronously, typically only at the request of the monitor. Tracing utilizes sensors which are small pieces of code that are embedded within the program and that perform the desired recording of information. Although complex techniques for developing sensors exist <ref> [OSS93] </ref>, simple techniques are surprisingly useful. For example, many distributed systems [Sun90, BFS + 94] supply library routines for communication, synchronization and spawning of tasks. These integral events are traced by providing macro wrappers that first perform the tracing operation and then call the desired routines. <p> Sampling may be performed by sensors or in some cases by probes, which reside in the monitor and directly access the address space of the application <ref> [OSS93] </ref>. Sampling is useful when one may only need cumulative statistics such as the number of sends and receives by a node at various stages of the execution of an application. <p> These features are currently being utilized when more esoteric data from an application needs to be visualized. A substantial amount of work has been done in the area of application-specific monitoring <ref> [Sno88, KS91, OSS93] </ref>. Typically, special languages are provided to allow the user to specify the application-specific aspects of a program that need to be monitored. This is then used to produce application-specific sensors and probes. <p> This is then used to produce application-specific sensors and probes. Unfortunately, these monitors typically do not provide the timestamping support that can be crucial to the development of visualizations and animations. For example, the Issos monitor <ref> [OSS93] </ref> does not address the need for synchronizing wall clock timestamps, nor does it provide support for logical timestamps. Although these may be innocuous issues when monitoring tighly coupled multiprocessors, they are in our opinion crucial when monitoring loosely coupled distributed systems.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, this article solely focuses on tracing. Ongoing research suggests, however, that online sampling is a meritorious approach in various situations. An overview of online monitoring can be found in <ref> [Sch95] </ref>. 2.2 Desired Trace Support As previously mentioned, visualization is dependent on some type of monitoring that records the interesting aspects of a distributed system. These records subsequently are interpreted by the visualization tool to produce the graphical presentation.

Reference-contexts: However, this need not be the case if proper tracing is provided. The following are the tracing attributes we consider acceptable for the development of visualizations of applications in distributed computing environments: * Concurrency Information|Modern visualization toolkits often support the notion of concurrent animations <ref> [SK93] </ref>; events in the distributed environment that are concurrent can be visualized as such. However, if the tracing does not provide information 3 as to which events are (or can be) concurrent, producing an accurate animation can be difficult. <p> Application-specific visualizations can be very informative when general purpose visualizations fail to provide the user with necessary information. A thorough discussion of application-specific views can be found in <ref> [SK93] </ref>. 3 The Dual Timestamping Methodology As previously touched upon, our dual timestamping methodology utilizes a primary and secondary timestamp in its event traces. Both timestamps contribute to provide knowledge regarding events in the distributed computing system. This section provides an overview of both timestamps. <p> In this section, we present the primary PVaniM views, and their dependence upon our timestamp-ing techniques. We then present PVaniM's implementation of its tracing support, including a thorough description of its techniques for providing dual timestamps. 3.3.1 PVaniM Views using the POLKA animation toolkit <ref> [SK93] </ref>. Near the top of Figure 3 is the Gantt view. This is PVaniM's adaptation of the ParaGraph Gantt view.

Reference-contexts: The dual timestamping methodology is the cornerstone of PVaniM, a framework we have developed to support the creation of general purpose and application-specific visualizations of distributed programs. PVaniM is an enhancement package for the popular PVM <ref> [Sun90] </ref> distributed computing environment. Section 3 describes PVaniM and its implementation which did not require any modifications to PVM; rather, it relies solely on postprocessors and macros. we feel these techniques are general and easily adaptable to other domains. <p> Tracing utilizes sensors which are small pieces of code that are embedded within the program and that perform the desired recording of information.

Reference-contexts: A simple approach to minimizing perturbation used by systems such as PGPVM <ref> [TSA94] </ref> is the use of extensive buffered tracing.

Reference-contexts: However, if the tracing does not provide information 3 as to which events are (or can be) concurrent, producing an accurate animation can be difficult. One possible approach, which we have previously used <ref> [TSS95] </ref>, is the addition of a Lamport logical timestamp that provides information as to which events are concurrent in a distributed system. <p> This approach can convey critical information to the viewer, information that simply cannot be achieved with a serialized view of a parallel application. An example of a concurrent animation is the Conch message passing view <ref> [TSS95] </ref>, a snapshot of which is displayed in Figure 2. In this view, processes are laid out around the outside circle. <p> The view provides a global overview of process utilization and is a substantial aid for perfomance tuning. Below the Gantt view in Figure 3 is the PVaniM Causality view. This view is an ada-patation of the Lamport view provided by the Conch distributed computing environment's 7 8 visualization subsystem <ref> [TSS95] </ref>. In the PVaniM version of this communication view, the Y--axis is labeled with process identifiers and the X-axis is labeled with Lamport clock values. When a message is sent, a circle appears at the appropriate logical time coordinate. Varying circle radii are used to denote message size. <p> For other distributed communication environments, system integration may be a feasible approach. The techniques discussed in this section for performing dual timestamping can be integrated into a system using an approach similar to that used by the Conch distributed computing environment <ref> [TSS95] </ref>, as all postprocessing techniques are derivatives of online distributed algorithms introduced in [Lam78]. This section provides a thorough description of our macros and postprocessing techniques.

Integrating these types of algorithms into systems (and avoiding the need for postprocessing) clearly has several advantages <ref> [TSS95] </ref>. However, the contribution of the nonintegrated approach described in this article is that its techniques apply to distributed systems in general. They may even be used by systems in which communication subsystem modification is not a viable option. <p> PVaniM provides a pvanim print () routine that allows the user to write a character string with a maximum length of 512 bytes to the trace file. This technique is adapted from application-specific visualization support provided by the Conch system <ref> [TSS95] </ref>. The pvanim print () routine prepends this string with an event identifier, a process identifier and the dual timestamps. This information is required for all types of trace events used by PVaniM.
