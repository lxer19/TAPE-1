Title: Digital Communication Over Rayleigh Fading Channels  
Author: T. M. Parks 
Date: 15 December 1992  
Abstract: The properties of Rayleigh fading channels are derived and their effects on various QAM signal constellations are explored. A simplified channel model for an urban radio environment is justified in order to simplify the analysis of error performance for the constellations. Finally, arguments are made for extending the results to more general channel models.

Reference-contexts: The ratio of the amplitudes can take on three values: 1=fi, 1, and fi. Thus, the ratio is compared to two thresholds, r 1 &lt; R k =R k1 &lt; r 2 . 16 The probability of error is <ref> [AA92] </ref> (27) 6.3.2 Differential 8PSK The argument of the decision variable is 6 (Q k =Q k1 ) = k k1 .

For slow fading, the phase error due to the fading is insignificant compared to the phase error due to the additive white Gaussian noise.

Reference-contexts: Thus the average SNR for 16 star QAM is fl 2 = 2 2 (20) and the probability of symbol error is approximately p s 2Q B v u t 2 sin 2 ( fi 2 + 1 1 A (21) A more accurate estimate is given by <ref> [CNM92] </ref>, where fl 2 b is the average SNR perbit. p x Q ( 2Dfl b ) + Q ( 2Efl b ) + Q ( 2F fl b ) (22) 8 sin 2 ( fi 2 + 1 E = fi 2 + 1 15 D = 8 ) (25) <p> Instead of presenting a long list of equations, results from the literature are cited. Results similar to those shown in Table 1 were also reported in <ref> [CNM92] </ref>. 7 Conclusion A Rayleigh fading channel can introduce deep fades in both the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristic of a received signal. It was shown that 18 for a typical urban environment, the simplifying assumptions of slow, flat fad-ing are justified.

Reference-contexts: Minimum bandwidth for transmitting this as a passband signal is 16 kHz. Assume that the excess bandwidth is 100%, so the signal bandwidth is 32 kHz. In fact, the IS-54 standard has a data rate of 48.6 kb/s and a 30 kHz channel spacing <ref> [Goo91] </ref>, so these are realistic estimates of the data rate and bandwidth. In order for a flat fading model to hold, the bandwidth must be narrow, B t 2 t , or in this case t t 2 B $ 31:3s.

Reference-contexts: The Doppler frequency given in Equation 6 corresponds to a receiver moving through the medium away from a stationary transmitter <ref> [HR81] </ref>. When the receiver is stationary and the transmitter is moving away, the Doppler frequency is given in Equation 7. For electromagnetic radiation, such as radio, where relativistic effects must be taken into account, the Doppler frequency is given in Equation 8.

Reference-contexts: Thus the overall probability of symbol error is approximately p s 3Q d ! The exact probability of symbol error for coherent 16 square QAM is <ref> [LM88] </ref> p s = 3Q d ! 9 Q 2 d ! Assuming a high SNR, the Q 2 () term is insignificant, and the approximation in Equation 12 is a good one.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, a higher sampling rate can be used at the receiver to avoid increasing the bandwidth of the transmitted signal [WHS91]. If the flat fading assumption fails, then the channel can be divided into frequency cells separated by the coherence bandwidth ! c 2=t <ref> [Pro91] </ref>. These cells experience independent fading, thus introducing diversity into the transmitted signal. Each frequency cell now experiences flat fading, so the preceding analysis once again applies.

Reference-contexts: When these assumptions do not hold, simple modifications can be made. If the slowly fading assumption fails, then a higher symbol rate can be used.

If the flat fading assumption fails, then the channel can be divided into frequency cells separated by the coherence bandwidth ! c 2=t [Pro91].
