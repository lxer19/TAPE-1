Title: Integration of Prosodic and Grammatical Information in the Analysis of Dialogs  
Author: Walter Kasper and Hans-Ulrich Krieger 
Address: Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3 D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany  
Affiliation: DFKI GmbH  
Abstract: The analysis of spoken dialogs requires the analysis of complete multi-sentence turns. Especially, the segmentation of turns in sentential or phrasal segments is a problem. In this paper we present a system for turn analysis. It is based on an extension of HPSG grammar for turns and takes into account extra-linguistic prosodic information. We show how this information can be integrated and represented in the grammar, and how it is used to reduce the search space in parsing.

Reference-contexts: Lexical entry for the verb komme containing its syntactic and semantic properties simultaneously. In the verbmobil project we use an HPSG grammar described in the typed feature formalism TDL (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>) for the analysis of dialog turns. It is a codescrip tive grammar specifying simultaneously syntax and semantics. As an example, frame and predicate-argument-structure.

Reference-contexts: This allows it to narrow down the set of emitted hypotheses. The sem-parser additionally receives hypotheses from two prosodic components. The one simply termed prosody is the detector for phrase boundaries and sentence mood as described in <ref> [12] </ref>. The other one is a detector for focus ([5]).

Reference-contexts: The parsing process is distributed on two parsers running in tandem. The first one is the parser for the word lattices coming from speech recognition, the other one is the constraint solver which also builds the semantic representation. 2 The word-lattice parser <ref> [14] </ref> uses the full HPSG grammar o*ine (viz., for training). At run time, only the context-free skeleton of the grammar is used. Because this set of rules overgenerates w.r.t. the original grammar, certain rule application are in fact not valid. Such applications are ruled out by the second parser.
