Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the Polaris compiler <ref> [BEF + 93] </ref>, dependences are maintained in Arc type objects, which are a compact form embedded within the nodes representing variable references in the expression trees of a program. Access to dependence information is provided through DDiterator objects on DDGraph objects.
