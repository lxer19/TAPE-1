Abstract: In this paper we develop lower bounds for the spectral radius of symmetric, skew-symmetric, and arbitrary real matrices. Our approach utilizes the well-known Leverrier-Faddeev algorithm for calculating the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in conjunction with a theorem by Lucas which states that the critical points of a polynomial lie within the convex hull of its roots. Our results generalize and simplify a proof recently published by Tarazaga for a lower bound on the spectral radius of symmetric matrices. In addition, we provide new lower bounds for the spectral radius of skew-symmetric matrices.

Reference-contexts: Of interest in these types of networks is the nature of fixed points of (13). In particular, we are concerned with the number of stable fixed points, and their location in the state space. Using the results in this paper we demonstrate a result similar to one in <ref> [2] </ref>, which shows that as the weight matrix becomes large, the stable fixed points of (13) must move away from the center of the state space.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it is doubtful that in practice one would have the values of a or b in (2). If one had an expression for the characteristic polynomial of A, then a bound on the spectral radius could be found using Cauchy's bound, Montel's bound, or Charmichael and Mason's bound <ref> [3] </ref>. However, such bounds are not likely to be very tight since they bound the magnitude of all eigenvalues. In fact, none of these bounds can ever be greater than one, and so they are not useful for determining the instability of (1).

In addition, much work as been done on obtaining lower bounds for the spectral radius of nonnegative matrices [4, 6]. One bound relevant to our results is due to Tarazaga <ref> [8] </ref>, who showed that the spectral radius of a symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix of rank m is (A) m s m (m 1) kAk F m where kAk F , q P i;j is the Frobenius norm of A.
