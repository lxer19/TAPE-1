Reference-contexts: If X is uniformly distributed over some convex region, the optimal quantizer cells are a tessellation of regular polytopes (see <ref> [1] </ref> and the discussion at the end of [39]). In one dimension the optimal cells for a uniform source distribution are contiguous intervals of identical lengths, in two dimensions they are contiguous hexagons (cf. Figures 4.1 and 4.2). <p> E ja 0;0 j 2 jb 0;0 j 2 = 2 (2jC (~)j 2 1)(S o (~) + S o (~)) d~ (5:1:6) One can show that the jC (~)j 2 corresponding to D N=2 (Daubechies' choice), N = 2; 4; 6; : : : , assumes values only in <ref> [ 1 2 ; 1] </ref> for ~ 2 [0; 2 ].

When this quantity is greater than 1 2 , the transform is concentrating the energy in a 1 into a 0 . When it's less than 1 2 , the energy is being concentrated into b 0 .

Reference-contexts: Another popular group of transforms for TVQ are the transformations afforded by perfect reconstruction filter banks in one and two dimensions <ref> [102, 100, 84, 108, 30, 4, 36, 101, 82] </ref>, including the DTWT (cf. Section 2.4.1). This type of TVQ system is commonly referred to as a sub-band coding system, the sub-blocks in such systems are typically scalar.

Reference-contexts: The link between the DTWT and QMF's was apparently first recognized by Mallat [65]. In order to show how the DTWT is distinguished within the context of QMF's, we briefly review some basic QMF theory. More details may be found in <ref> [65, 90, 91, 89, 96, 92, 6, 83] </ref>. A prototypical QMF structure is displayed in Figure 2.13.

Note that this polyphase structure is more computationally efficient than that of Figure 2.14, the filters operate at the system's lower rate. It can be shown <ref> [6] </ref> that a general solution to E (z) E (z) = I exists whenever G 0 (z) and G 1 (z) are coprime. In this case H (z) is determined from G (z) via a Bezout identity [96].

Reference-contexts: Before presenting the TVQ system that will be the focus of this chapter, we briefly mention some other popular forms of structurally constrained VQ. Lattice quantization is a technique with modest computational requirements and essentially no storage requirements <ref> [41, 19] </ref>. The codewords in a lattice quantizer are constrained to lay on a lattice, namely a subset of IR N defined by fx 2 IR N : x = Au for some u 2 ZZ N g where A is a non-singular matrix called the generator of the lattice. <p> No storage is required since the preceding expression characterizes all codewords; fast algorithms exist for determining the closest lattice point to an arbitrary point in the space <ref> [19] </ref>. A different type of structural constraint is employed in Tree-Structured Vector Quantization (TSVQ) [40] to reduce the complexity of the search relative to unconstrained VQ (but not the storage requirements).

Reference-contexts: Figures 4.1 and 4.2). In three or more dimensions, Zador [107] established that the limiting (normalized) distortion of a high-rate optimal quantizer for a uniform distribution over a convex region is equal to a constant, the constant depending only upon the dimension of the underlying space and r <ref> [107, 20] </ref>, for both rate and entropy constrained quantizers. <p> The second caveat is that C (N; r) and the corresponding optimal polytopes are only known for one and two dimensions (an interval and a hexagon, respectively). In more than two dimensions, even the existence of the optimal poly-topes has not been verified <ref> [20] </ref>. The functional form of Gersho's expressions have been verified, however, independently of the optimal polytope conjecture in [11, 107]. <p> For smaller values of N , approximations to C (N; 2) based on the best known lattices <ref> [20] </ref> also support this conjecture.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 2 with the French geophysicist Morlet who introduced the wavelet concept in the context of seismic signal processing. Interesting historical accounts of the transform's development appear in several recent articles, among them those by Daubechies <ref> [25] </ref>, Lawton [57] and Resnikoff [74]. At the heart of the transform is the simple notion of approximation via dilations and translations of a single function (t), referred to as the mother wavelet. <p> If equation (2.1.3) is satisfied, the following inversion formula holds on the range of the transform (see Appendix 2.A). f (t) = C 1 Z Z ( W f )(a; b) a;b (t) db a 2 (2:1:4) This equation is discussed in more detail in <ref> [47, 25] </ref>. Whenever ^ is continuous at zero (equivalently, whenever (t) decays sufficiently fast; j (t)j = o (t 2 ) as t ! 1, for example) the condition of equation (2.1.3) is equivalent to ^ (0) = (t) dt = 0: (2:1:5) Chapter 2. <p> In between these two extremes, however, lies another important class of invertible wavelet transforms that map L 2 (IR) to l 2 (ZZ 2 ) with non-critical sampling.

Reference-contexts: If X is uniformly distributed over some convex region, the optimal quantizer cells are a tessellation of regular polytopes (see [1] and the discussion at the end of <ref> [39] </ref>). In one dimension the optimal cells for a uniform source distribution are contiguous intervals of identical lengths, in two dimensions they are contiguous hexagons (cf. Figures 4.1 and 4.2). <p> Prompted by this result and the one and two-dimensional results cited above, Gersho <ref> [39] </ref>) conjectured that at high rates (large jIj) the cells of the optimal quantizer for a uniform distribution over any convex set would correspond to a tessellation of a particular polytope determined solely by N and r (up to a scaling), with the possible exception of cells adjoining the boundary of <p> In more than two dimensions, even the existence of the optimal poly-topes has not been verified [20]. The functional form of Gersho's expressions have been verified, however, independently of the optimal polytope conjecture in [11, 107]. Various bounds on C (N; r) have been obtained [107] or proposed <ref> [39, 21] </ref> in the literature, here we present upper and lower bounds due to Zador, both obtained by random coding arguments. 1 " (1 + N # r=N (1 + r N N=2 2 ) (4:1:10) For r = 2, the upper and lower bounds and hence C (N; 2) have <p> It is interesting to note that the lower bound is N 1 `(sphere). In the context of Gersho's conjecture this is a pleasing result because the sphere has a moment of inertia with respect to its centroid that is less than that of any polytope with the same volume <ref> [39] </ref>. The sphere is not an admissible quantizer cell shape however; it is not a polytope and it can not be tessellated. 4.1.2 Structured Vector Quantizers The benefits of vector quantization are afforded at the costs of increased storage and computational complexity relative to scalar quantization.

Reference-contexts: Connecting the right and left sides of Figure 2.12, one obtains a multirate filter structure whose overall transfer function is unity. This is a particular instance of a Perfect Reconstruction Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF). The link between the DTWT and QMF's was apparently first recognized by Mallat <ref> [65] </ref>. In order to show how the DTWT is distinguished within the context of QMF's, we briefly review some basic QMF theory. More details may be found in [65, 90, 91, 89, 96, 92, 6, 83].

Reference-contexts: The first is simply to view negative optimal bit assignments as an indication that the high-rate results are not valid at the prescribed total rate. The second approach is to reformulate the Lagrange multiplier problem at the heart of the theorem's proof to include positivity constraints (see <ref> [81] </ref> for an example with scalar sub-blocks). Strict convexity of the distortion and a convex constraint area will yield a unique solution in this case, too. The problem with this latter approach is that the solution is not closed form.

Reference-contexts: The extension of this matrix to the entire z-plane, fi (z) = 4 C (z) D (z) 5 ; (2:4:7) is therefore paraunitary (this follows from an analytic continuation argument and the fact that C (z) and D (z) are polynomials, see <ref> [93] </ref>). Since the other two matrices on the right-hand side of equation (2.4.6) are paraunitary, the polyphase matrix E (z) corresponding to the DTWT filter bank is paraunitary and the DTWT filter bank is therefore a perfect reconstruction QMF.

Reference-contexts: They imposed novel definitions of graph stationarity upon the coefficients; and then developed a multiscale system theory with associated estimation algorithms, autoregressive models, and Schur and Levinson algorithms. Their work is interesting, but its relationship to conventional notions of stationarity for random processes is unclear. Wornell <ref> [103] </ref> used wavelets to synthesize 1=f processes. His work assumes a very simple correlation structure for the coefficients in which the coefficients are all independent. Here we treat the entire analysis/synthesis procedure and discuss the decomposition and approximation of any physical continuous time random process.
