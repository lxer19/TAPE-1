Abstract: Tight limits are derived on models with extended Higgs sectors, including the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), by exploiting the data on t + t + 2 jets final states, used by the CDF collaboration to place limits on third generation leptoquarks. The main observation here is that both leptoquark production and associated b b Higgs production can lead to b bt + t final states. For the MSSM we find that CP-odd neutral Higgs boson masses up to 190 GeV are excluded if the ratio of vacuum expectation values tanfi is 50.

Reference-contexts: For the MSSM we find that CP-odd neutral Higgs boson masses up to 190 GeV are excluded if the ratio of vacuum expectation values tanfi is 50. 1 Supersymmetry is widely regarded to be the most likely cure of various ills plaguing the Standard Model (SM) <ref> [1] </ref>. Supersymmetric field theories not only contain superpartners for all known SM particles, they also need (at least) two SU (2) doublets of Higgs superfields to give masses to both up-type and down-type quarks [2].

After electroweak symmetry breaking, this leaves (at least) five physical Higgs bosons: two neutral CP-even scalars h; H, with h being the lighter one; a neutral CP-odd scalar A; and charged Higgs bosons H .

Reference-contexts: The masses and mixings of the two neutral CP-even scalars can receive substantial radiative corrections <ref> [4] </ref>, the dominant contribution coming from loops involving top quarks and their superpartners. At present, the most stringent limits on the Higgs sector of the MSSM come from the e + e collider LEP at CERN.

Both these bounds are valid only in the MSSM. 3 The new bound shown in Fig. 2 has far reaching ramifications. For lack of space we merely mention two examples. <p> These scenarios require low m A and large tanfi to maximize the Higgs exchange contribution to the neutralino-nucleon scattering cross section. GeV is excluded by Higgs searches at the LEP collider. The region above the dashed curve is excluded by an analysis <ref> [6] </ref> of top quark decays. The region above the solid line is excluded by our analysis using CDF limits on b bt + t final states.

Reference-contexts: However, the combination of these bounds still leaves a large region of the parameter space unexplored. The most widely studied mechanism for producing neutral Higgs bosons at the Tevatron is the associated production of a CP-even scalar with a W or Z gauge boson <ref> [8] </ref>. Since two quite massive particles have to be produced in the final state, the total cross section is small. In addition, one will probably have to require the gauge boson to decay leptonically; this reduces the rate by another factor 0.22 (0.06) for W (Z)+ Higgs production.

Reference-contexts: Here we make use of the fact that the Ab b coupling is proportional to tanfi, i.e. the cross section grows as tan 2 fi. This can easily lead to a factor 1,000 enhancement over the corresponding cross section <ref> [9] </ref> for SM Higgs production. In addition, in the region tanfi 1 one of the two neutral CP-even Higgs bosons of the MSSM is always nearly degenerate with A, and its coupling to b b pairs has essentially the same strength as the Ab b coupling.

Reference-contexts: This contribution can therefore be safely neglected. In the region of the parameter space of interest to us (m A 200 GeV, tanfi 1) the decays of A and its nearly mass degenerate CP-even partner are completely dominated by b b and t + t final states <ref> [10] </ref>, which occur with branching ratios of ' 90% and 10%, respectively. Most b b Higgs events therefore lead to final states containing four b (anti)quarks.

Reference-contexts: Most b b Higgs events therefore lead to final states containing four b (anti)quarks. Unfortunately this signal suffers from very large QCD backgrounds; these can be controlled by severe cuts, but then one needs an integrated luminosity of several fb 1 for a measurable signal <ref> [11] </ref>. We therefore focus on Higgs boson decays to t + t pairs, which lead to far cleaner b bt + t final states. 1 Indeed, the CDF collaboration has searched for an excess in precisely this final state, in the context of searching for third generation leptoquarks [12].

This enhancement of the signal to background ratio is no less welcome for being accidental; note that CDF searched <ref> [12] </ref> for t + t pairs without any spin correlation. As emphasized earlier, there is no evidence for any non-SM contribution to the final state defined by cuts (i) (iv), which allowed the CDF collaboration to place an upper bound of 38 fb on any such contribution.

Reference-contexts: In our simulation we generate b b Higgs events and let the Higgs boson decay into t + t pairs. We model hadronic t decays as a sum of two-body decays into -t ; -t and a 1 -t , with branching ratios given in the literature <ref> [13] </ref>. We next apply the cuts (i) (iv). Note that we do not include any out-of-cone losses for the bjets, which would reduce the cross section; nor do we attempt to model energy smearing or initial state radiation, which increase the cross section.

Reference-contexts: This spin correlation affects the efficiency with which our events pass the cuts (i) (iii), since the t decay spectrum depends quite strongly on the t polarization <ref> [14] </ref>. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the energy spectrum of the visible decay products of ultra-relativistic t leptons decaying either leptonically or into -t . We can assume without any loss of generality that t decays leptonically while t + decays hadronically. <p> Finally, the a 1 spectrum from t + ! a + 1 -t decays is almost independent of the t polarization <ref> [14] </ref>; cut (i) nevertheless favors the combination t L t + In contrast, Drell-Yan backgrounds only produce t L t + R t + L final states.

Reference-contexts: Both these bounds are valid only in the MSSM. 3 The new bound shown in Fig. 2 has far reaching ramifications. For lack of space we merely mention two examples. First, simple SO (10) models require tanfi ' 50 in order to unify all three third generation Yukawa couplings <ref> [15] </ref>. For tanfi = 50, our bound excludes the region m A 190 GeV. This excludes the entire branch of "low m A " solutions found by Blazek and Raby in their recent analysis of a complete SO (10) model [16].
