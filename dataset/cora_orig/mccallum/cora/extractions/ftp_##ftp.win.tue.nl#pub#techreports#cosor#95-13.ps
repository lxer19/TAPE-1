Reference-contexts: At the theoretical level the existence and the search procedure for the Nash equilibrium need attention. The final report of the investigation is published elsewhere, see [3]. Other investigations into routing control For an introduction to routing control see <ref> [1] </ref>. M. Papa-georgiou [5] has proposed to use optimal control theory to synthesize a control law that meets the control objectives. As part of the DRIVE Project QUO VADIS several routing control laws have been proposed by M. Papageorgiou and others. <p> The effect of an input on the splitting fraction at an intersection reflects the compliance of drivers to the route directives. Let u ((i; j); k; m; :) : T ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; represent the route directives for OD pair (i; j), for route k, at intersection m. Let the vector u contain all routing fractions.

Reference-contexts: Further research on routing control is required. The algorithm must be tested in simulation and subsequently be tested on the road. At the theoretical level the existence and the search procedure for the Nash equilibrium need attention. The final report of the investigation is published elsewhere, see <ref> [3] </ref>. Other investigations into routing control For an introduction to routing control see [1]. M. Papa-georgiou [5] has proposed to use optimal control theory to synthesize a control law that meets the control objectives.

Experience with routing control An experiment with routing control was performed near Amsterdam, The Netherlands. On November 14, 1991 a variable message sign was put in use called the RIA-sign for Route choice Information Amsterdam.
