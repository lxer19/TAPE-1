Reference-contexts: Our approach combines an agent-oriented paradigm that has recently emerged in AI research (see (Shoham 1993) for an example of such approach), with OR techniques that allow quantification of expected benefits of production-related decisions together with the uncertainties involved <ref> (Ballot 1986) </ref>. We use decision theory as a single paradigm for directing an agent's behavior, and apply it to decisions on coordinated physical actions and on communication. <p> Our work brings together diverse threads in the areas of operations research and decision-making in manufacturing <ref> (Ballot 1986) </ref>, as well as in game theory (Au-mann & Brandenburger 1994; Brandenburger 1992; Brandenburger & Dekel 1993; Harsanyi 1967; Mertens & Zamir 1985) and artificial intelligence (Horvitz, Cooper, & Heckerman 1989; Russell & Wefald 1991; Cohen & Levesque 1990; Fagin, Halpern, & Vardi 1991; Shoham 1993).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we show how the matrices depicting the decision-making situations of manufacturing agents can be arrived at. As an example we consider a reentrant flow system characteristic for semiconductor manufacturing plants. Decision-Making in a Reentrant Flow System Reentrant flow setup is characteristic for semiconductor warefs fabrication facilities <ref> (Kumar 1994) </ref>. A simple example of such a system is depicted in Figure 1. It consists of two manufacturing robots, R1 and R2, producing three kinds of parts, P1, P2, and P3. <p> b 2 2 holds parts P3 on the sec ond stage of their three-stage production process. this formulation the payoff reflects the current value of the partially processed product, and the parts further along in the process are favored, which implements the known concept of "Last Buffer First Serve" (LBFS) <ref> (Kumar 1994) </ref>. As we mentioned, different combinations of the above factors constitute various ways to tie the prefer ences of each individual production agent to the over all objective of the production facility in terms of effectiveness and throughput, minimal cycle time and its variance, and ultimately profit.

Reference-contexts: The above formulation causes the agents never to process a part to be passed to a nigh-bour's buffer that is already full, thus implementing the Kanban lookahead philosophy <ref> (Pastravanu, Gurel, & Lewis 1994) </ref>, and gives preference to parts in agent's buffers that are filling up. All other factors being equal, the agents will give preference to processing more valuable parts first.

Reference-contexts: That is, R1 has no idea how R2 could possibly model R1 in making its choice. This lack of information is represented by two uniform probability distributions depicted on the third level of the recursive model structure in Figure 3. Uniform distributions, according to the principle of entropy maximization <ref> (Neapolitan 1990) </ref>, precisely represent the lack of information in this case, since their informational content is zero. 3 We refer to the uniform distributions used in this way as no-information models. 4 Our approach to finding a solution of the above structure, i.e., to arrive at the rational choice of R

Reference-contexts: Thus, the recursive model structure will change as depicted in Figure 4. 6 The notion of the utility of a message we consider here is orthogonal to the notion of the value of information considered in decision theory <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>. The latter expresses the value of information to its recipient.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, even when some units break down and are carted away for repairs, the others should continue to function, reconfiguring as needed to make up for the lost capacity and missing functionality. Our approach combines an agent-oriented paradigm that has recently emerged in AI research (see <ref> (Shoham 1993) </ref> for an example of such approach), with OR techniques that allow quantification of expected benefits of production-related decisions together with the uncertainties involved (Ballot 1986).
