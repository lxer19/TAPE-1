Abstract: This paper examines the network routing messages exchanged between core Internet backbone routers. Internet routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reachability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have led to the loss of internal connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In an earlier study of inter-domain routing, we described widespread, significant pathological behaviors in the routing information exchanged between backbone service providers at the major U.S. public Internet exchange points. These pathologies included several orders of magnitude more routing updates in the Internet core than anticipated, large numbers of duplicate routing messages, and unexpected frequency components between routing instability events. The work described in this paper extends our earlier analysis by identifying the origins of several of these observed pathological Internet routing behaviors. We show that as a result of specific router vendor software changes suggested by our earlier analysis, the volume of Internet routing updates has decreased by an order of magnitude. We also describe additional router software changes that can decrease the volume of routing updates exchanged in the Internet core by an additional 30 percent or more. We conclude with a discussion of trends in the evolution of Internet architecture and policy that may lead to a rise in Internet routing instability.

The Internet in the U.S. now includes more than 60 geographically diverse regional exchange points <ref> [1] </ref>. A significant level of traffic still transits the original NAPs, but the overall trend in Internet architecture is towards a more distributed model of inter-provider connectivity.

Reference-contexts: In addition to providing support for aggregation, most routing protocol implementations include a minimum per-peer advertisement timer on out-bound protocol announcements. This timer serves two purposes: dampen extremely high frequency oscillation, and improve the efficiency of protocol processing. Several BGP implementations, including <ref> [5, 16, 14] </ref>, use this jittered timer to coalesce multiple outbound routing updates with shared attributes into a single BGP update message. The BGP specification recommends a 30 second timer interval for generation of transit routes advertisements, and a 10 second interval for internal route advertisements [12].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the scale and complexity of large protocol deployments often introduces side-effects not seen in smaller deployments, such as self-synchronization or orders of magnitude more traffic than anticipated <ref> [7] </ref>. Routing instability, commonly referred to as route flaps, significantly contributes to poor end-to-end network performance and degrades the overall efficiency of the Internet infrastructure. <p> Most Internet standards require that all protocol timers include a random jitter. This requirement stems from the danger of self synchronization. As described in <ref> [7] </ref>, under certain conditions, an initially unsynchronized system of apparently independent routers may inadvertently synchronize and generate unexpectedly high aggregate traffic loads. After the publication of results [13], the vendor responsible for the unjittered timer implementation developed a software update.

Reference-contexts: Further, a recent study has shown that the Internet topology is becoming even less hierarchical with the rapid addition of new exchange points and peering relationships <ref> [8] </ref>. As the topological complexity grows, the quality of Internet address aggregation will likely decrease, and the potential for instability will increase as the number of globally visible routes expands. Overall, scalability is a critical aspect of the design and implementation of the Internet routing infrastructure. <p> In an earlier analysis of routing instability [13], we used data collected from BGP probe machines to identify a number of gross trends and pathologies in inter-domain routing information. Other studies of routing instability include the work of Chinoy, Paxson, and Govindan <ref> [4, 19, 8] </ref>. Chinoy measured the instability of the NSFNet backbone [4] in 1993.

Govidian examined similar data, but focused primarily on gross topological characterizations, such as the growth and topological rate of change of the Internet <ref> [8] </ref>. 16 6 Impact of Routing Instability and Conclusion At the time of our previous analysis [13], the volume of routing update messages in the Internet core posed a significant problem for backbone providers. As described earlier, forwarding instability can have a significant deleterious impact on the Internet infrastructure. <p> This work in conjunction with several other research efforts has begun to examine inter-domain routing through experimental measurements <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. These research efforts help characterize the effect of added topological complexity in the Internet since the end of of the NSFNet backbone.

We assume the reader is familiar with the Internet architecture and BGP routing concepts discussed in <ref> [13, 12, 9] </ref>. The Internet is dominated by twelve large Internet service providers. These national and international providers, often referred to as tier one providers, account for the majority of routes and bandwidth that comprise the public Internet. <p> A complete description of the different BGP path attributes is provided in <ref> [9] </ref>. We show that a growing proportion of AADiffs derive from specific changes in provider policy and Internet topology. Figure 4 shows the normalized breakdown of changes in path attributes between successive Prefix+AS updates at Mae-East over an 11 month period. <p> Figure 5 shows an example of this network configuration. We will subsequently refer to this policy as IBGP mapped MED. In Figure 5, we depict an example involving three interconnected autonomous systems: AS1, AS2 and AS3. All three autonomous systems use an IGP, such as ISIS <ref> [9] </ref>, to maintain reachability amongst their internal and border routers. Every IGP router has an administratively assigned metric associated with each of its interfaces. For clarity, we only show these metrics in AS2.

Moreover, the scale and complexity of large protocol deployments often introduces side-effects not seen in smaller deployments, such as self-synchronization or orders of magnitude more traffic than anticipated [7]. <p> In our previous work on routing instability, we observed several orders of magnitude more routing updates messages exchanged between core Internet backbone routers than anticipated <ref> [13] </ref>. Although the Internet core only maintains reachability information for approximately 50,000 prefixes, we observed between three and six million routing prefix updates each day. On average, this accounted for 125 updates per network on the Internet every day. <p> Finally, Section 6 evaluates the impact of some these routing behaviors and provides concluding remarks. 2 Background This paper builds on the the analysis and background discussion provided in our earlier work. We assume the reader is familiar with the Internet architecture and BGP routing concepts discussed in <ref> [13, 12, 9] </ref>. The Internet is dominated by twelve large Internet service providers. These national and international providers, often referred to as tier one providers, account for the majority of routes and bandwidth that comprise the public Internet. <p> Finally, we show that instability remains well distributed across prefix and autonomous system space, and that instability is not related to prefix length. 4.1 Analysis of Gross Trends Since our last analysis of Internet routing <ref> [13] </ref>, the volume of inter-domain routing messages in the Internet core has decreased by an order of magnitude. <p> In June 1996, Mae-East routers generated in excess of two million pathological withdrawals per day. In marked contrast, two years later the volume of pathological withdrawals at Mae-East consistently remained below ten thousand. 1998. In our earlier analysis of inter-domain routing <ref> [13] </ref>, we showed that the majority of BGP updates (99 percent) consisted of pathological, duplicate BGP withdrawal messages. We postulated that the majority of these extraneous, pathological withdrawals stemmed from specific BGP software implementation decisions made on at least one widely deployed commercial router. <p> It is important to note that the stateless BGP implementation was compliant with the current IETF BGP standard [12]. After the publication of findings <ref> [13] </ref>, the vendor responsible for the stateless BGP implementation updated their router operating system software. Most commercial routers today now maintain at least partial state on advertisements to their BGP peers, and will only transmit updates when topology changes affect a route between the local and peer routers. <p> As an illustration of this trend, our data shows that in March 1996 Mae-East routers generated in average of 25,498 MED AADiffs per day. In May 1998, this number of MED AADiffs almost doubled, with an average of 40,834 per day. 4.4 Frequency In our analysis in <ref> [13] </ref>, we examined the frequency components of several categories of routing instability. To review, we defined a routing update's frequency as the inverse of the inter-arrival time between routing updates; a high frequency corresponds to a short inter-arrival time. <p> This requirement stems from the danger of self synchronization. As described in [7], under certain conditions, an initially unsynchronized system of apparently independent routers may inadvertently synchronize and generate unexpectedly high aggregate traffic loads. After the publication of results <ref> [13] </ref>, the vendor responsible for the unjittered timer implementation developed a software update. The vendor first released the new code in late January 1997. By summer of 1998, Internet providers had deployed the updated software on a significant number of core backbone routers. <p> These data represent August 1996 at the Mae-East exchange. a disproportionate amount of Tup instability. 5 Previous Work The deployed, as opposed to the theoretical, behavior of network protocols is an area of active research. A number of studies, including <ref> [13, 6, 15, 19, 20] </ref> have developed monitoring software and deployed probe machines across wide area and local networks.

As described earlier, forwarding instability can have a significant deleterious impact on the Internet infrastructure. <p> Further, we described new router software changes currently undergoing testing that may reduce instability levels by an additional thirty percent. Overall, our data showed that both providers and vendors had addressed the most systemic problems described in <ref> [13] </ref>. The latest generation of routers from several vendors (including Ascend Communications and Cisco Systems) provide highly tuned, and scalable implementations of inter-domain routing protocols. <p> The remainder of the persistent oscillations derived from a number of origins, including: policy configuration errors, additional router software bugs and oscillating hardware failures. Our analysis suggests that the majority of BGP updates, however, likely represent "legitimate" changes in topology or policy. As a significant finding of <ref> [13] </ref>, we demonstrated instability was closely tied to network usage patterns. This relationship suggests that the Internet experiences widespread network congestion or failures as bandwidth demands increase during the course of each day.
