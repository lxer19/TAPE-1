Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The central goal of this document is to evaluate the TSQL2 language specification against an extensive consensus test suite for temporal relational query languages <ref> [Jensen et al. 1993] </ref>. The test suite is not related to performance issues, but has a semantic focus and is intended to be an aid in evaluating the user-friendliness of temporal query languages. <p> A number of restrictions were imposed on which types of queries are intended to be included in the current test suite. These restrictions are listed in the test suite <ref> [Jensen et al. 1993] </ref>. It should be emphasized that the test suite is not intended to constitute a metric for query language completeness, and hence this evaluation is not a substitute for a rigorous theoretical study of the expressive powers of TSQL2. Such a study is still needed.

Reference-contexts: For Skill, there is no non-trivial key. For Dept, each of Name and MgrID are snapshot (as well as time-invariant) candidate keys; Name is selected as the primary key. Each of the table schemas are in temporal BCNF <ref> [Jensen et al. 1992] </ref>. 3 The Test Suite Data There are two employees, identified by ED and DI in the following. ED worked in the Toy department from 2/1/82 to 1/31/87, and in the Book department from 4/1/87 to the present.
