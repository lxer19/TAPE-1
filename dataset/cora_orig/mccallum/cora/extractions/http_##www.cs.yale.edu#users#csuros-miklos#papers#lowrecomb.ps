Title: LOWER BOUNDS ON SEQUENCE LENGTHS REQUIRED TO RECOVER THE EVOLUTIONARY TREE  
Author: MIKL OS CS -UR OS AND MING-YANG KAO 
Note: (extended abstract submitted to RECOMB '99)  
Abstract: In this paper we study the sequence length requirements of distance-based evolutionary tree building algorithms in the Jukes-Cantor model of evolution. By deriving lower bounds on sequence lengths required to recover the evolutionary tree topology correctly, we show that two algorithms, the Short Quartet Method and the Harmonic Greedy Triplets algorithms have optimal sequence length requirements.

Reference-contexts: Many of these algorithms strive to find an evolutionary tree among all possible trees to fit the observed distances the best according to some metric. Such an optimization task is provably NP-hard in known cases; see [8] for L 1 and L 2 metric norms, and see <ref> [1] </ref> for L 1 . However, a number of distance-based algorithms are computationally efficient. Examples include Neighbor-Joining [21, 20], Short Quartet [10], Harmonic Greedy Triplets [7], the algorithm of Farach and Kannan [12], and the algorithm of Cryan, Goldberg and Goldberg [6] to mention a few. <p> Many distance-based algorithms have sequence length bounds that are exponential in the diameter and therefore in n. Atte-son [2] established an O f 2 (1ffg) diam bound on sample length requirements of Neighbor-Joining [20] and related algorithms. The algorithms 7 of Agarwala et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, and Farach and Kannan [12] try to find a tree T fl such that the distance matrix D T fl is close to ^ D in the L 1 metric, i.e., max i;j j ^ D [i; j] D T fl [i; j]j is small.
