Title: The Use of Gene Clusters to Infer Functional Coupling  
Author: Ross Overbeek Michael Fonstein zy Mark D'Souza Natalia Maltsev Gordon D. Pusch 
Date: October 1998  
Abstract: Earlier, we presented evidence that it is possible to predict functional coupling between genes based on conservation of gene clusters between genomes. With the rapid increase in availability of prokaryotic sequence data, it has become possible to verify and apply the technique. In this paper, we extend our characterization of the parameters that determine the utility of the approach, and we generalize the approach in a way that supports detection of common classes of functionally coupled genes (e.g., transport and signal transduction clusters). Now that the analysis includes over 30 complete or nearly complete genomes, it has become clear that this approach will play a significant role in supporting efforts to assign functionality to the remaining uncharacterized genes in sequenced genomes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Gene clusters are known to be prominent features of bacterial chromosomes. De-merec and Hartman <ref> [1] </ref> postulated in 1959 that "regardless of how the gene clusters originated, natural selection must act to prevent their separation" and the "mere existence of such arrangements shows that they must be beneficial, conferring an evolutionary advantage on individuals and populations which exhibit them." One of the most striking features of

Reference-contexts: Here, we present a method that uses conserved gene clusters from a large number of genomes to predict functional coupling between genes in those genomes. This article further develops the approach previously reported by us in <ref> [6] </ref> and uses this method to reconstruct several major metabolic and functional subsystems. 2 Methodology The data presented below are computed via the WIT system (http://wit.mcs.anl.gov/WIT2/), developed by Overbeek et al. [7] at Ar-gonne National Laboratory. <p> fact that the standard deviation is significantly larger than the mean, the gap distribution is rather skewed; nevertheless, two standard deviations above the mean still provides a reasonable cutoff for the maximum allowed gap, showing that our initial assumption of a 300 bp maximum gap in a "run" used in <ref> [6] </ref> was not too far off. It is important to note that we are dealing with data that suffer from many sources of error and uncertainty. <p> The arbitrary "same-genome score" should, we believe, have a value that is high enough to rank such instances as significant. In <ref> [6] </ref>, we found that PCBBHs with score above 0.1 were significant, and PCBBHs with scores above 1.0 were highly significant; therefore, choosing a "same genome" score of 0.5 seems a reasonable first approximation.

Reference-contexts: phylogenetic distance between the genomes in deciding whether the 4 observed linkage of their genes is due to chance, we developed the following simple scoring mechanism: The score of a PCBBH is given by the phylogenetic distance between organism G a and organism G b in the 16S rRNA tree <ref> [8] </ref>, regardless of the physical distance between the ORFs in either run, or the degree of similarity of either BBH. We give some representative phylogenetic distances in Table 3. A number of other scoring functions were explored, but none appeared to display a significant advantage over this simple scheme.
