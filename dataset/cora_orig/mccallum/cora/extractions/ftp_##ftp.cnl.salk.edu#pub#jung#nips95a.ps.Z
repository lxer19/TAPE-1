Abstract: We report here that changes in the normalized electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) cross-spectrum can be used in conjunction with feedforward neural networks to monitor changes in alertness of operators continuously and in near-real time. Previously, we have shown that EEG spectral amplitudes covary with changes in alertness as indexed by changes in behavioral error rate on an auditory detection task [6, 4]. Here, we report for the first time that increases in the frequency of detection errors in this task are also accompanied by patterns of increased and decreased spectral coherence in several frequency bands and EEG channel pairs. Relationships between EEG coherence and performance vary between subjects, but within subjects, their topographic and spectral profiles appear stable from session to session. Changes in alertness also covary with changes in correlations among EEG waveforms recorded at different scalp sites, and neural networks can also estimate alertness from correlation changes in spontaneous and unobtrusively recorded EEG signals.

Reference-contexts: EEG correlation and coherence are intimately related: changes in moving-average correlations of EEG waveforms reflect changes in broad-band, zero-lag coherence of activity at the same sites. The possibility of using moving-average correlation measures of electrophysiological activity to monitor state changes in animals was discussed by Arduini <ref> [1] </ref>, but to our knowledge this approach has not previously been applied to human EEG. The origin and function of nonstationarity in EEG synchrony are not yet understood.

Reference-contexts: Coherence values are known to be higher in sleep than in waking [8], and wake-sleep transitions have been noted to be preceded by increased coherence at some frequencies <ref> [2] </ref>. Our results, from data on three subjects performing a sustained auditory detection task under soporific conditions, suggest that during drowsiness, coherence may either increase or decrease, depending on the subject, analysis frequency, and electrode sites analyzed.

Reference-contexts: Recently, we have shown that using principal components analysis in conjunction with feedforward neural networks, minute-scale changes in performance on a sustained auditory detection task can be estimated in near real-time from changes in the EEG spectrum at one or more scalp channels <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. Here, we report, first, that loss of alertness during auditory detection task performance is also accompanied by changes in spectral coherence of EEG signals recorded at different scalp sites. <p> Measuring changes in EEG coherence and correlation during other cognitive tasks give clues to the possible role of variable EEG synchrony in brain and cognitive dynamics. We are now investigating to what extent moving EEG coherence and/or correlation measures, in combination with spectral amplitude measures <ref> [4] </ref>, will allow practi-cal, robust, continuous, and near-real time estimation of alertness level in auditory detection and other task environments. using a feedforward three-layer perceptron on moving correlations between (1-20 Hz) band passed EEG signals for 8 selected pairs of 7 scalp channels.

Reference-contexts: Target hits were defined as targets responded to within a 100-3000 ms window; other targets were called lapses. After eye movement artifacts were removed from the data using a selective regression procedure <ref> [5] </ref>, and data containing other large artifacts were rejected from analysis, complex EEG spectra were computed by advancing a 512-point (1.64 s) data window through the data in 0.41 s steps, multiplying by a Hanning window, and converting to frequency domain using an FFT.

Ten adult volunteers participated in three or more half-hour sessions during which they pushed one button whenever they detected an above-threshold auditory target stimulus (a brief increase in the level of the continuously-present background noise).

Reference-contexts: The feedforward neural networks had 3, 4, and 5 hidden units, respectively. Weights and biases of the network were adjusted using the error backpropagation algorithm [9]. Conjugate gradient descent was used to minimize the mean-squared error between network output and the actual error rate time series. Cross-validation <ref> [7] </ref> was used to prevent the network from overfitting the training data. For each of the 6 training-testing session pairs and each neural network architecture, the time course of error rate was estimated five times using different random initial weights between -0.3 and 0.3.
