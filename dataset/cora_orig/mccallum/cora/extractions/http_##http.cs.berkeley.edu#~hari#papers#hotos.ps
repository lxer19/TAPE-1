Title: Abstract  
Abstract: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well in traditional networks made up of wired links with stationary hosts. Networks with wireless links and mobile hosts violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded performance. In this paper, we describe a simple protocol that improves TCP performance by modifying network-layer software only at a basestation without violating end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea is to cache packets at the basestation and perform local retransmissions. Simulations of this protocol show that it is significantly more robust in the presence of multiple packet losses in a single transmission window as compared to TCP. This enables our protocol to tolerate at least 10 times as high an error rate without any performance degradation.

Reference-contexts: These handoffs involve transfer of communication state (typically network-level state) from one basestation (a router between a wired and wireless network) to another, and typically last for anywhere between a few tens to a few hundreds of milliseconds <ref> [CI94, KMS + 93, SLBR94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Link-level Retransmissions [PAL + 95]: In this approach, the wireless link implements its own retransmission protocol at the data-link level. In addition, TCP implements its own end-to-end retransmission protocol. Studies have shown that independent retransmission protocols such as these lead to degraded performance, especially as error rates become significant <ref> [DCY93] </ref>. A tight coupling of transport and link-level retransmission timeouts and policies is necessary for good performance. In particular, information needs to be passed down to the data link layer about timeout values and policies reasonable for co-existence with the higher transport layer policy.

Reference-contexts: This behavior arises due to the fact that errors on the wireless link or delays due to handoffs are incorrectly interpreted by TCP at the sender as congestion. In response to this congestion, TCP drops its transmission window size before retransmitting packets, initiates congestion control mechanisms (slow start <ref> [Jac88] </ref>) and resets the retransmission timer using an exponential backoff computation from the previous value (Karns Algorithm [KP87]), thereby unnecessarily reducing its bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we describe a simple protocol to alleviate this degradation and present the results of several simulations of this protocol.
