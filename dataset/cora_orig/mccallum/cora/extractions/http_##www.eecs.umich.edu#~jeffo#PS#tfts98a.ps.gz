Title: CHIRP HUNTING  
Author: Jeffrey C. O'Neill and Patrick Flandrin

Abstract: We use the principles of maximum likelihood estimation to construct a method for decomposing signals into a weighted sum of chirped Gabor functions. This method provides a sparse representation of the signal similar to basis and matching pursuit methods. However since the parameters of the chirps are estimated rather than discretized, the dictionary is essentially of infinite size. Since the maximum likelihood estimator requires excessive computations, we propose sub-optimal estimators for the chirp parameters, and present a novel method for estimating chirp rate.

His method is roughly equivalent to a grid search on a coarsely sampled, four dimensional space and has a computational complexity of O (N 2 log N ).

Reference-contexts: Using the estimates of the chirp rate and duration, estimate the location in time and frequency. 3. Re-estimate, from a local measure, the chirp rate and dura tion. 4. Go to step 2 until convergence. Step 1 can be accomplished with the ambiguity function <ref> [6] </ref>, but for simplicity we will chose to initialize the chirp rate and duration to neutral values in this paper. Step 2 will be accomplished by finding the maximum value of the spectrogram with a window function corresponding the current estimate of the chirp rate and duration.

Reference-contexts: To reduce the computations, we will use a two step procedure where we first estimate the chirp rate and then estimate the duration.

Several authors have proposed using Radon or Hough transform techniques with time-frequency distributions, e.g. [8, 9, 10].
