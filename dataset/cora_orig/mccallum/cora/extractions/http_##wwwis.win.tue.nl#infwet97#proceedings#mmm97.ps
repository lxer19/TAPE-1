Title: MODELS, MEDIA AND MOTION: USING THE WEB TO SUPPORT MULTIMEDIA DOCUMENTS  
Author: DICK C.A. BULTERMAN

Abstract: The World-Wide Web has been used extensively to present hypertext documents that have a limited mixture of text and simple graphics which are distributed via the public Internet. The performance characteristics of the Internet have made the delivery of complex multimedia documents (that is, documents that include time-based components) difficult. An effort is currently underway by members of industry, research centers and user groups to define a standard document format that can be used in conjunction with time-based transport protocols over Inter and Intranets to support rich multimedia presentations. This paper outlines the goals of the W3Cs Synchronized Multimedia working group and presents an initial description of the first version of the proposed multimedia document model and format.

Reference-contexts: This restriction may be released in future versions of (H)MML. General support for hypermedia is a complex task. Interested readers are invited to study the approaches defined for the Amsterdam Hypermedia Model <ref> [3] </ref>, which serves as the basis for the current (H)MML proposal. 4 Current Status and Future Directions As of the writing of this article (late September, 1997), may of the details of the encoding of (H)MML were being finalized.

Reference-contexts: the start time of another sibling object using a BEGIN=object_id + time attribute. (Unless otherwise specified, all objects are displayed for their implicit durationsdefined by the object encoding or the length of the enclosing &lt;par&gt; group.) The specification of a relative start time is a restricted version of CMIFs sync_arcs <ref> [4] </ref> to define fine-grain timing within a document. At present, only explicit time offsets into objects are supported, but a natural extension is to allow content markers, which provide content-based tags into a media object. <p> The effect depends on the value of the SHOW attribute as described above. . . . blah blah blah blah blah <ref> [4] </ref> blah blah blah blah blah!

Reference-contexts: HTML documents cannot express the synchronization primitives required to provide a coordinated presentation, and the HTTP protocol cannot provide the guaranteed delivery of time-based media objects required for continuous media data. 2 The development of Java extensions to HTML, known as Dynamic HTML <ref> [5] </ref>, provide one approach to introducing the necessary synchronization support into Web documents. <p> The effect depends on the value of the SHOW attribute as described above. . . . blah blah blah blah blah [4] blah blah blah blah blah!

Reference-contexts: This approach has the advantage that the author is given all of the control offered by a programming language in defining interactions within a document; this is similar to the use of the scripting language Lingo in CD-ROM authoring packages like Director <ref> [6] </ref>. Such an approach has the disadvantage that defining even simple synchronization relationships becomes a relatively difficult task for Web users who have little or no programming skillsthe vast majority. An alternative to using a programming language is the use of a declarative multimedia document format. <p> The effect depends on the value of the SHOW attribute as described above. . . . blah blah blah blah blah [4] blah blah blah blah blah!

Reference-contexts: The Webs clever application of traditional technologies and its universal acceptance among a wide range of users has provided an information sharing backbone that is unique in history. The success of the Web is based largely on the use of a simple document format <ref> [8] </ref> and a straightforward (sub)document transfer protocol [9].
