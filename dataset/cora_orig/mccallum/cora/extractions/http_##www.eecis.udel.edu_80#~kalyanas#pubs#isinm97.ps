Abstract: The existing SNMP management framework does not effectively support a hierarchical management strategy. Further, existing MIBs have a static structure and do not permit dynamic user organization of management information. This paper presents a spreadsheet paradigm that allows users to dynamically configure management information and set up control at an intermediate manager. This paradigm augments the basic SNMP framework by providing value added functionality at a proxy node so that it can function as an intermediate manager. The design of a proxy MIB, a scripting language, and event model that form an integral part of the paradigm are presented with future research directions.

Hierarchical event building allows simple events (in cells) to be used to build more complex events. Existing models <ref> [CMRW96] </ref> allow only event definitions and object relationships that are predefined in the MIBs supported by an agent. RMON [Wal95] allows users to set up monitoring information including event and threshold specification. However, the events that can be specified are fairly restrictive.

Reference-contexts: However, it cannot be effectively used because the framework lacks essential support for hierarchical management; it provides no means for managers to delegate tasks to intermediate managers or to communicate with the intermediate managers during the execution of these tasks. Management by delegation is a well-known strategy <ref> [YGY91, Gol95, GY95] </ref> for implementing hierarchical management, but so far the SNMP community has been unable to take advantage of it because the delegation primitives have not been integrated with the SNMP framework.

This section describes the main features of the spreadsheet language (SSL) that forms an integral part of the spreadsheet paradigm and supports the development of network management scripts. SSL supports features that can be broadly classified as: 1) standard procedural language features and 2) spreadsheet paradigm specific features.

RMON <ref> [Wal95] </ref> allows users to set up monitoring information including event and threshold specification. However, the events that can be specified are fairly restrictive. Moreover, the user cannot set up operations to be performed on management information across nodes. Also, the user cannot set up control functions that can be executed.
