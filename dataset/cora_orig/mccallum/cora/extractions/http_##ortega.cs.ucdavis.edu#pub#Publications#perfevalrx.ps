Abstract: Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) has the ability to utilize the enormous bandwidth offered by optical networks using today's electronics. A reservation-based multicasting protocol for local lightwave networks was examined in [5]. If implemented properly, multicasting allows the use of scarce network resources more efficiently than unicasting. On the other hand, a multicasting protocol is usually more complex than a unicasting protocol. An analytical model of a multicasting protocol can enable its comparison with a simpler but less efficient unicasting protocol. We present an approximate analytical solution for the average packet delay in a local lightwave network, which employs the Multicast Scheduling Algorithm [5] as its medium-access control (MAC) protocol. First, we develop an approximate analytical solution for the probability distribution of the receiver busy time. We demonstrate and explain some interesting and unobvious behavior of this distribution. Then, using the receiver busy time distribution, we calculate the maximum receiver throughput and the average packet delay. Results from the analytical solution match very well with those obtained from simulation.

Reference-contexts: A multichannel, WDM single-hop protocol that incorporates multicasting was examined in [13]. An upper bound on the performance of multicasting on a WDM local network was studied in [4]. Collision-less unicast packet scheduling was examined in [9]. In <ref> [5] </ref>, a control-channel-based, collision-less, media-access protocol that schedules multicast packets, while incorporating arbitrary transceiver tuning times and propagation delays was proposed. A performance measure called the receiver throughput, denoted by S R , was used for analyzing the performance of the protocol. <p> It was also observed that S R may have a local maximum with respect to the multicast size as we shall show later in Figures 10 (a) and 10 (b). The existence of the local maxima was intuitively justified in <ref> [5] </ref>, but no analytical method for finding the position or value of the maximum was presented. If the optimum multicast size (for which S R attains a local maximum) is known, we could use this knowledge to improve the receiver throughput. <p> For example, one possibility would be to break up large multicast packets (i.e., multicasts with a large destination set) into smaller, optimum-sized multicasts. This study presents an analytical model of the system in <ref> [5] </ref>. Developing an accurate analytical model is one of the first steps in finding an analytical formula for the receiver throughput (which could then be used for finding the optimum multicast size). <p> The analytical model presented in this work agrees well with 3 simulation. Many new insights about the behavior of the system are also gained during the analysis. Section 2 summarizes the work in <ref> [5] </ref>, laying the foundation for our analysis. Section 3 introduces the mathematical model and the rationale behind certain assumptions in the analytical model. In Sections 4 and 5, we derive analytical formulas for the packet delay and the maximum receiver throughput, respectively. <p> Section 6 presents some numerical examples and compares the results from analysis with those from simulation. Finally, concluding remarks are stated in Section 7. 2 Multicast Scheduling Algorithm (MSA) The single-hop WDM medium-access protocol in <ref> [5] </ref> assumes that each node is equipped with t tunable transmitters and r tunable receivers, as well as a fixed transmitter/receiver pair tuned to the control channel (in our present study, we assume that t = 1 and r = 1). <p> Propagation delay has negligible effect on throughput <ref> [5] </ref>. It only adds a constant term to the packet delay. * The transmitter tuning time is not very large compared to the receiver tuning time. Later in this section, we will provide the rationale for this assumption. <p> is given by: D prop = 2R (39) Thus, the average value of the total packet delay (D tot ) experienced by a data packet is: D tot = D c + D r + D d + D s + D prop (40) 27 5 Maximum Receiver Throughput In <ref> [5] </ref>, a control-channel-based, collision-less, medium-access protocol that schedules multicast packets, while incorporating arbitrary transceiver tuning times and propagation delays was proposed. A performance measure called the receiver throughput, denoted by S R , was used for analyzing the performance of the protocol. <p> A performance measure called the receiver throughput, denoted by S R , was used for analyzing the performance of the protocol. S R is defined to be the average number of receivers in use at steady state. It was observed in <ref> [5] </ref> that the maximum receiver throughput S fl R may have a local maximum with respect to the maximum multicast size 7 . An intuitive explanation for the existence of the maximum is as follows. <p> On the other hand, if the control channel is the bottleneck, then p fl = 1. Thus, p fl is given by: p fl = min 1; K a (42) Hence, S fl 7 The multicast size in <ref> [5] </ref> was assumed to have a uniform distribution between 1 and L max , where L max is the maximum multicast size. 8 We define a bottleneck as the main contributor to the packet delay, and hence, the bottleneck determines the maximum achievable throughput. 28 In Section 3.1, Assumption 2 stated
