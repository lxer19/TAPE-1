Reference-contexts: For rational coefficients this is done in modular arithmetic so the answer is exact with very high probability. Most of the online computation is numeric for reasons of speed; in particular we use double precision floating point numbers. We use the LAPACK package <ref> [ABB + 92] </ref> because it implements state-of-the-art algorithms, including block algorithms on appropriate architectures, and provides efficient ways for computing condition numbers and error bounds. Moreover it is publicly available, portable, includes a C version and is soon to include a parallel version for shared-memory machines.

Reference-contexts: A helpful survey of classical elimination methods is [KY92] whereas standard techniques from numerical analysis are presented in <ref> [Dre78, AG90] </ref>. The principal numerical techniques are continuation or homotopy methods which trace the paths of the roots of a parametrized system as it varies, by small steps, from an easy to solve starting system to the given one.

Reference-contexts: For integers of size O (b), addition and subtraction, multiplication and division and, lastly, the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) operation require respectively O (b), O (b log b log log b) and O (b log 2 b log log b) bit operations <ref> [AHU74] </ref>. We shall use M (b) = O (b log 2 b log log b) as an upper bound on the bit complexity of any arithmetic or GCD operation between any two rational numbers with numerator and denominator of size O (b). <p> If ffi + 1 interpolation pairs are available, dense interpolation can be used to compute the coefficients in O (ffi log 2 ffi) arithmetic operations by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) <ref> [AHU74, ch. 8] </ref>. If, furthermore, there is an a priori bound T on the number of nonzero terms that is significantly lower than the maximum number ffi+1, then sparse interpolation is preferable. <p> Besides the classical application to integer arithmetic <ref> [AHU74] </ref>, modular methods and the Chinese Remainder theorem can be used with rational data with the same asymptotic complexity [DST88]. The basic approach is as follows. <p> The multiplication takes time O (D log D) and the GCD O (D log 2 D) by interpolation techniques based on FFT <ref> [AHU74, Ch. 8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Nash equilibrium is a well-established concept that captures the notion of a stable or final state in a game hence the computation of all valid equilibria presents an interesting problem. Alternative concepts of equilibrium have been suggested in <ref> [AMR92] </ref>, whose computation reduces to deciding the existential theory of the reals and may, therefore, be relevant to sparse elimination. Here we illustrate the case of computing mixed Nash equilibria.

Reference-contexts: The reduction of root finding to an eigenproblem was proposed in <ref> [AS88] </ref> and independently in the work of Manocha and Canny who obtained very fast methods for dealing with specific problems in modeling, graphics and robotics [Man92]. These implementations proved significantly faster than previous approaches relying on Grobner bases and homotopies.

Of course it is always possible to use other packages such as EISPACK [SBD + 76] or LINPACK <ref> [BDMS79] </ref>. A crucial question in numerical computation is to predict the extent of roundoff error; see for instance [GL89].

Reference-contexts: The Newton polytope provides the bridge from the algebraic to the combinatorial geometric setting, by modeling sparseness in geometric terms. The planar construct, namely the Newton polygon, was introduced by Newton [New60, pp. 110-163] in using Puiseux series for studying the local behavior of plane curves; see also <ref> [BK86, ch. 8] </ref>. Some combinatorial geometry is required in the sequel; all concepts of interest are surveyed in [Sch93]. For arbitrary sets in R n there is a natural associative and commutative addition operation called Minkowski addition.

Reference-contexts: In the worst case, the hull of n points in d dimensions has O (n bd=2c ) facets. However, the expected number of facets for points selected randomly as above is proportional to log d1 n <ref> [BKST78] </ref>; this is verified by our experimental results. 116 Chapter 7 Conclusions This thesis proposes efficient algorithmic solutions to elimination problems in computer algebra and computational algebraic geometry. Root finding may be considered as a special case of elimination and is the main purpose of our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: to be so by coordinate comparisons, though for the Orientation test they are not even collinear. 6.2 Previous Work The simplest approach in coping with degeneracies is to handle each special case separately, which is tedious for implementors and unattractive for theoreticians, though some recent work reexamines this common belief <ref> [DMY93, BMS94] </ref>. Dantzig's [Dan63] symmetry breaking rules in linear programming are regarded as the precursor of current systematic perturbations. The principal idea is to perturb the right-hand side of every constraint equation by an infinitesimal quantity that depends on the index of this equation. <p> The reason is that the overhead incurred by perturbing is not output-sensitive. For instance, given n coincident points as input to an algorithm solving the CHF problem, the exact output is a single point whereas the perturbed output is a polytope with n bd=2c facets. See <ref> [BMS94] </ref> for a discussion of limitations of this approach. <p> This leads us to generic position and the symbolic perturbations that achieve it. The basic existential question on the perturbation method is still open. After the flurry of papers proposing different perturbation schemes, some objections have recently been voiced against the general applicability of this method <ref> [DMY93, BMS94] </ref> motivated by the observation that the difficulty and complexity of postprocessing might dominate that of the entire program. 118

Reference-contexts: A promising development in solving very large polynomial systems comes from sparse homotopies which exploit the structure of polynomials as modeled by Newton polytopes [HS, VVC94, VG94]. Grobner, or standard, bases provide an algebraic method for computing special bases of ideals and thus studying their coordinate rings <ref> [Buc85, Buc89] </ref>. Operations between polynomial ideals are simplified and calculation of common isolated roots for an arbitrary number of polynomials can be carried out over exact arithmetic, in contrast to numerical methods that use floating point arithmetic. Grobner bases constitute a widely applied approach and several implementations exist.

Reference-contexts: Typically, the cost of explicitly computing this polynomial is exorbitant therefore strategies have been devised to derive the root coordinates by determinant computation and interpolation from a matrix formula <ref> [Can88b, MC93] </ref>. Alternatively the roots may be represented as the values of rational functions at the zeros of a resultant polynomial [Ren87]. The method applies to zero-dimensional varieties but fails when the homogenized system has excess components at infinity. <p> To produce this matrix, we should modify RC to select the minimum possible index. As defined originally the subdivision algorithm will produce the Macaulay matrix of f 1 and analogous choices for RC produce inertia forms with exact degrees in the other polynomials. To keep with notation in <ref> [KY92, Can88b] </ref> we do use the modified RC that selects the minimum polynomial index. We demonstrate that the corresponding Macaulay matrix equals the constructed matrix M . <p> Unfortunately, this method does not always work when the coefficients of the f i are specialized. It can be used after a suitable perturbation of the specialized system, but there is a more economical method, adapted from <ref> [Can88b] </ref>, of which two variants are sketched below. Division Method Let g 1 ; : : : ;g n+1 be the given specialized polynomials. First we choose polynomials h 1 ; : : : ; h n+1 with random integer coefficients, such that h i has support A i .

Reference-contexts: Another merit of this work is that it discusses postprocessing in detail in order to recover the exact solution. A structural perturbation for a motion-planning algorithm, in which the input objects are the semi-algebraic sets describing the obstacles, is given by Canny in <ref> [Can91] </ref>. He uses towers of infinitesimals to eliminate degeneracies while preserving essential properties of the sets, namely emptiness and number of connected components. 102 6.3 Linear Perturbations The high worst-case complexity of SoS is essentially due to the high degree of the *-factor.

Reference-contexts: The improved version of the first algorithm in section 3.1.6 removes this hypothesis. The first algorithm uses a mixed subdivision and was proposed in <ref> [CE93] </ref>. As in the previous chapter, a sufficiently generic lifting induces the subdivision of the Minkowski sum. In the present context, the lifting resembles the monomial ordering imposed in defining Grobner bases.

Reference-contexts: For zero-dimensional affine varieties a tight upper bound on the complexity is d O (n) [Y.N90], while the bit complexity is d O (n 2 ) ; see also <ref> [CGH89] </ref>. For zero-dimensional homogeneous varieties the arithmetic complexity is again d O (n) [HRS93]. Although Grobner bases perform significantly better than the worst-case bounds in several cases, they fail to take advantage of the polynomial structure.

Reference-contexts: Equality holds when all coefficients are generic. Canny and Rojas have substantially weakened the requirements for equality <ref> [CR91] </ref> by requiring only the coefficients corresponding to Newton polytope vertices to be generic. A further combinatorial specification of which coefficients must be generic was proposed in [Roj94]. Fulton states a slight generalization of Khovanskii's version that applies to arbitrary varieties, including infinite ones.

Reference-contexts: Postprocessing then has to merge these segments by eliminating points in the interior of polygon edges. This process is analyzed for the general CHF problem in section 6.7. Postprocessing for the problem of polytope intersection is examined in <ref> [DMY93] </ref>. For INV, given a perturbed singular matrix, the algorithm should return its inverse and the perturbed input should be arbitrarily close to the original one under the standard euclidean metric. <p> to be so by coordinate comparisons, though for the Orientation test they are not even collinear. 6.2 Previous Work The simplest approach in coping with degeneracies is to handle each special case separately, which is tedious for implementors and unattractive for theoreticians, though some recent work reexamines this common belief <ref> [DMY93, BMS94] </ref>. Dantzig's [Dan63] symmetry breaking rules in linear programming are regarded as the precursor of current systematic perturbations. The principal idea is to perturb the right-hand side of every constraint equation by an infinitesimal quantity that depends on the index of this equation. <p> Dobrindt, Mehlhorn and Yvinec proposed an efficient scheme specifically for coping with degenerate intersections between a convex and a general polyhedron in three dimensions <ref> [DMY93] </ref>. It is noteworthy that the vertices of the convex polyhedron are guaranteed to be perturbed in a specific direction with respect to the given facets. Another merit of this work is that it discusses postprocessing in detail in order to recover the exact solution. <p> This leads us to generic position and the symbolic perturbations that achieve it.

Reference-contexts: The explicit condition here is that the specialized resultant under f i 7! g i is irreducible and the determinants D 1 (0) and D 2 (0) do not vanish. Complexity The analysis of computing the sparse resultant R from resultant matrices reduces to analyzing certain standard polynomial algorithms <ref> [Loo82, DST88, Mis93] </ref>. For example, using the second approach reduces to computing the determinants of two resultant matrices by interpolation, finding their GCD by a subresultant polynomial sequence and lastly computing a polynomial quotient. The arithmetic complexity is polynomial in jEj. <p> Besides the classical application to integer arithmetic [AHU74], modular methods and the Chinese Remainder theorem can be used with rational data with the same asymptotic complexity <ref> [DST88] </ref>. The basic approach is as follows. <p> Then, it is straightforward to compute the exact volume by summing all simplex volumes whose expression as an *-polynomial has a nonzero constant term. Note that extension to rational inputs is possible without affecting the asymptotic complexity; for the case of modular arithmetic see <ref> [DST88] </ref>. The extreme points of a given point-set are those that strictly maximize the inner product with some d-vector, i.e.they are not expressible as a convex combination of the other points; these are exactly the vertices of the convex hull.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter we describe efficient methods for systematically coping with such degeneracies using symbolic infinitesimal perturbations. Our methods apply to every algorithm that can be implemented on a real RAM. This work is influenced by the treatment of the problem in <ref> [EM90] </ref> and, in a more general context, [Yap90b]. The main contribution of this article is to introduce the first general and efficient perturbations from the viewpoint of worst-case complexity. Previous methods incurred an extra computational cost that was exponential in some parameter of the input size. <p> All inputs not dealt with by a program can be modeled by the vanishing of some polynomial in the input. Conforming to the standard viewpoint in the literature <ref> [EM90, Yap90b, EC95, Sei94] </ref> we have Definition 6.1.5 An input instance is degenerate with respect to some program, if and only if it causes some numerator or denominator polynomial f at a branch to vanish, where f is not identically zero. <p> b i (*) = b i + * i ; where x 1 ; : : : ; x n are the original variables, each x i for i &gt; n is a slack variable and the a i;j and b i are constants. 101 Edelsbrunner and Mucke generalize in <ref> [EM90] </ref> a technique called Simulation of Simplicity (SoS for short), already presented in [Ede86], which refines the above method. Every input coordinate x i;j is perturbed into x i;j (*) = x i;j + * 2 iffij ; where ffi &gt; d and d is the dimension. <p> In <ref> [EM90] </ref> every such vector is associated with a minor that may have to be evaluated. Yap in [Yap90b] deals with the more general setting in which branching occurs at arbitrary rational expressions and proposes a method which is equivalent to an infinitesimal perturbation, as proven in [Yap90a]. <p> P d i d+1 ;j P d i d+2 ;j 7 7 7 7 : Eliminating degeneracies for the particular matrix could be achieved by the "cheap trick" of <ref> [EM90] </ref> which perturbs the points on the higher-dimensional paraboloid, by perturbing the sum of squares as if it were an additional coordinate. However, this may lead to inconsistencies in some special configurations, if the same algorithm also uses another primitive such as fl d+1 . <p> complexity of evaluating the primitive is O (d 2 (ds + d 2 log n) 1+ff + (ds + d 2 log n)MM (d) log d): The overhead now follows from s log n. 2 6.5.4 Other Primitives Our techniques directly apply to several other primitives including those presented in <ref> [EM90] </ref>. Primitives that decide on the relative position of derived objects may pose a limitation to our method. Consider, for instance, the two-dimensional ham-sandwich algorithm in [EW86] with lines on the plane being the input objects and their intersection points being the derived objects.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the lifting is not constrained to map R n to R n+1 , although this is computationally more efficient. One of the earliest approaches <ref> [Emi93] </ref> suggested lifting to R n 2 , thus avoiding most of the genericity conditions.

Reference-contexts: We extend the discussion to systems of n + 1 polytopes where we establish bounds in terms of the sum of n-fold mixed volumes.

Lemma 2.2.1 For unmixed systems Q 1 = = Q n . <p> Polynomials need not be homogenized and the explicit resultant polynomial is never computed. Instead a matrix formula is used to reduce root-finding to an eigenproblem, which allows the application of powerful techniques from linear algebra. We generalize the results in <ref> [Emi94] </ref> to minimize the a priori knowledge required by the algorithm, thus incorporating both resultant matrix construction algorithms. The study of coordinate rings of varieties in K n , where K is a field, has been shown to be particularly useful in studying systems of polynomial equations.

Different mathematical formulations of the problem can be found in <ref> [FM90, Hor86, Hor91] </ref>. To formalize, let orthonormal 3 fi 3 matrix R 2 SO (3; R) denote the rotation i.e. R T R = RR T = I and det R = 1. Let (column) vector t 2 R 3 denote the camera translation in the original frame of reference. <p> Demazure [Dem88] demonstrated that this polynomial system has at most 20 complex solutions, whereas simplified proofs of this fact can be found in <ref> [FM90, Hor91] </ref>. <p> The Bezout bounds will usually increase significantly as a result, but the Bernstein bounds decrease. This runs against the conventional wisdom for dealing with multivariate polynomials, which is to keep the number of variables as low as possible. In <ref> [FM90, sect. 5.3] </ref> epipolar geometry is used to formalize the algebraic problem with unknowns (u 0 ; u 1 ; u 2 ) and (v 0 ; v 1 ; v 2 ) and inputs e i ; e 0 i ; ffi i ; ffi 0 ij . <p> The main result of the paper <ref> [FM90] </ref> is that this system has 10 solutions. The Bernstein bound for the system as given is 18. Inspection of the equations shows that there are common subexpressions in the last two equations. <p> The running times for the two main phases are reported in table 5.1. The rest of this section examines the accuracy of our procedure on two specific instances from <ref> [FM90] </ref>; we use error criterion 5 X 1 i k i (t fi Ra 0 where j j denotes absolute value. k k is the vector 2-norm and t, R are the calculated translation and rotation. <p> This is typically the case in practical applications. For the particular example, there is a stronger reason why all roots are recovered, namely all polynomials include a constant term. Most implementations use more than the minimum number of point matches; the one in <ref> [FM90] </ref> is in Maple and is not intended for real-time applications. There exist various implementations of linear methods requiring at least 8 points, including [Hor91, Luo92].

Reference-contexts: We may, therefore, deflate the new matrix and solve for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are strictly less than rd. This is a well-defined problem and yields the common roots of the original system <ref> [GL89, ch. 7] </ref>. Another cubic method with lower practical complexity yet numerically less stable is based on the Kronecker canonical form [Wil78] which generalizes the Jordan form of numeric matrices. <p> Of course it is always possible to use other packages such as EISPACK [SBD + 76] or LINPACK [BDMS79]. A crucial question in numerical computation is to predict the extent of roundoff error; see for instance <ref> [GL89] </ref>. <p> Let b x j denote some column of X and let x j be the respective column if no roundoff error were present. Then the error is bounded <ref> [GL89] </ref> by kx b xk 1 &lt; where jEj r is the size of M 11 and we have used 2 10 16 as the machine precision under the IEEE double precision floating point arithmetic. <p> The case ff = fi = 0 occurs if and only if the pencil is identically zero within machine precision <ref> [GL89] </ref>, thus providing a runtime check on the overall accuracy. In recovering the eigenvector of matrix polynomial A (x) from the eigenvector of its companion matrix, we can use any subvector of the latter.

Reference-contexts: In general the proof of lemma 4.3.1 recovers all root coordinates by taking ratios of the vector entries.

Reference-contexts: The links are attached to the platforms by ball-joints that rotate freely. Parallel robots are especially useful when high stiffness and position precision are predominant requirements. Stewart [Ste65] introduced his platform to achieve these properties in flight simulation, while another fully parallel manipulator had already been proposed by Gough <ref> [Gou56] </ref>.

Invariably, resultants are used in the most efficient methods for quantifier elimination and decision procedures for the theory of the reals <ref> [Gri88, Can88a, Ren92, BPR94] </ref>. If the given polynomials are sparse in the current sense, the sparse resultant would be the natural choice in all of these methods.

Reference-contexts: To define the latter we recall certain concepts from polytope theory <ref> [Gru67] </ref>. A polyhedral complex is a finite collection of convex polytopes in R n such that the intersection of any two is a face of both and belongs to the collection. <p> The asymptotic complexity is dominated by the convex hull construction hence has overall complexity f (n 3 + vn) [PS85, sect. 3.4], where f is the number of facets of b Q.

Reference-contexts: Conformations specify the 3-dimensional structure of the molecule, thought of as a rigid body, modulo rotation and translation. Some authors reserve the term configuration for the ensemble of conformations during a time interval. It has been argued by Go and Scherga <ref> [GS70] </ref> that energy minima can be approximated by allowing only the dihedral angles to vary, while keeping bond lengths and bond angles fixed. At a first level of approximation, therefore, solving for the dihedral angles under the assumption of rigid geometry provides information for the energetically favorable configurations. <p> The algebraic problem for six-atom molecules is well-constrained. Extending to molecules with more than six varying dihedrals has been approached by a grid search of the space of the two last dihedrals, each grid point giving rise to a six-dimensional subproblem <ref> [GS70, MZW94] </ref>. For molecules with six free dihedrals and an arbitrary number of atoms, the problem is identical to the inverse kinematics of a general serial manipulator with six rotational joints and has been solved in real time [MC92c]. We consider molecules of six atoms to illustrate our approach.

Reference-contexts: In complexity bounds we sometimes ignore polylogarithmic factors in the involved quantities; this is denoted by O fl (). The change of variables that may be required to ensure that P i A i generates Z n involves the computation of a Smith normal form <ref> [HM91] </ref>. Typically, this step is not computationally expensive so we ignore it in the analysis. Identifying the vertices of all Newton polytopes may be reduced to linear programming as in the first phase of algorithm 3.1.5. We can apply either Khachiyan's Ellipsoid or Karmarkar's algorithm.

To formalize, let orthonormal 3 fi 3 matrix R 2 SO (3; R) denote the rotation i.e. R T R = RR T = I and det R = 1. Let (column) vector t 2 R 3 denote the camera translation in the original frame of reference.

Reference-contexts: Typically, computer vision applications use at least 8 points in order to reduce the number of possible solutions to 3 and, for generic configurations, to 1. In addition, computing the displacement reduces to a linear problem and the effects of noise in the input can be diminished <ref> [LH81, May85, LH88, Hor91] </ref>. Our approach shows performance comparable to these methods and is well-suited for detecting and eliminating outliers in the presence of noise. These are data points which are so much affected by noise that they should not be taken into account. <p> If noise is not significant, our approach would be a natural choice. 5.1.1 Problem Definition The problem has attracted attention by several researchers, as evidenced by the references throughout the section. Different mathematical formulations of the problem can be found in <ref> [FM90, Hor86, Hor91] </ref>. To formalize, let orthonormal 3 fi 3 matrix R 2 SO (3; R) denote the rotation i.e. R T R = RR T = I and det R = 1. Let (column) vector t 2 R 3 denote the camera translation in the original frame of reference. <p> Demazure [Dem88] demonstrated that this polynomial system has at most 20 complex solutions, whereas simplified proofs of this fact can be found in <ref> [FM90, Hor91] </ref>. <p> In what follows we adopt a different approach that yields an optimal mixed volume. 5.1.3 Quaternion Formulation The following quaternion formulation was independently suggested by J. Canny and is also proposed in <ref> [Hor91] </ref>. This allows a rational representation of rotations which is a promising approach for various problems in kinematics; a good reference is [McC90]. <p> Most implementations use more than the minimum number of point matches; the one in [FM90] is in Maple and is not intended for real-time applications. There exist various implementations of linear methods requiring at least 8 points, including <ref> [Hor91, Luo92] </ref>. We have been able to experiment with the latter which implements the least-squares method of [TH84], and found it faster on both instances but less accurate on the second one.

Reference-contexts: For zero-dimensional affine varieties a tight upper bound on the complexity is d O (n) [Y.N90], while the bit complexity is d O (n 2 ) ; see also [CGH89]. For zero-dimensional homogeneous varieties the arithmetic complexity is again d O (n) <ref> [HRS93] </ref>. Although Grobner bases perform significantly better than the worst-case bounds in several cases, they fail to take advantage of the polynomial structure. Polynomial system solving can be reduced to an eigenproblem via the construction of multiplication maps constructed by a Grobner basis computation.

Reference-contexts: Homotopies that follow the optimal number of paths have been proposed for multihomogeneous systems [MSW]. A promising development in solving very large polynomial systems comes from sparse homotopies which exploit the structure of polynomials as modeled by Newton polytopes <ref> [HS, VVC94, VG94] </ref>. Grobner, or standard, bases provide an algebraic method for computing special bases of ideals and thus studying their coordinate rings [Buc85, Buc89]. <p> Furthermore, it serves as a starting point for continuation methods that exploit the structure modeled by the Newton polytopes; these are called sparse homotopies and have recently been studied by different authors <ref> [HS, VVC94, VG94] </ref>. Subdivisions of unmixed systems are instrumental in the work of Viro [Vir84, Vir86] on constructing real algebraic curves of prescribed topology.

Reference-contexts: There exist several methods for solving polynomial systems, usually distinguished into algebraic methods, where root finding is viewed as a special case of eliminating variables, and numerical methods that typically rely on some iterative technique. A helpful survey of classical elimination methods is <ref> [KY92] </ref> whereas standard techniques from numerical analysis are presented in [Dre78, AG90]. The principal numerical techniques are continuation or homotopy methods which trace the paths of the roots of a parametrized system as it varies, by small steps, from an easy to solve starting system to the given one. <p> For certain deterministic choices of the lifing forms, the row content function and the perturbation vector, the subdivision algorithm yields Macaulay's matrix whose determinant is an inertia form, as defined by Hurwitz (see sect. 1.2); the respective algorithms are presented in <ref> [KY92, sect. 2.3] </ref> and [vdW50, sect. 81]. <p> To produce this matrix, we should modify RC to select the minimum possible index. As defined originally the subdivision algorithm will produce the Macaulay matrix of f 1 and analogous choices for RC produce inertia forms with exact degrees in the other polynomials. To keep with notation in <ref> [KY92, Can88b] </ref> we do use the modified RC that selects the minimum polynomial index. We demonstrate that the corresponding Macaulay matrix equals the constructed matrix M . <p> RC is once more modified to pick the minimum possible index. Then the set of integer points in nonmixed cells corresponds exactly to the set of monomials indexing the Macaulay minor that defines the denominator in the exact expression for the homogeneous resultant <ref> [KY92] </ref>. Interestingly, there exist values of ffi and l that do not lead to a reducible rational expression.

Reference-contexts: The condition of a Nash equilibrium may be expressed in terms of polynomials in these probabilities, where the coefficients are functions of certain measurable quantities. Given a system of polynomial equations and inequalities that describe a totally mixed Nash equilibrium McKelvey and McLennan <ref> [MM94] </ref> propose a transformation that produces an equivalent system of equations and inequalities. The new system has the same maximal number of interesting, or regular, solutions. The inequalities restrict all variables to nonzero values, therefore we are solely interested in toric roots. <p> The new system has the same maximal number of interesting, or regular, solutions. The inequalities restrict all variables to nonzero values, therefore we are solely interested in toric roots. Moreover, the system of equations is well-constrained and has an exact Bernstein bound <ref> [MM94] </ref>. It is clear that the system of equations conforms to our model of sparseness. Furthermore, all equations are multilinear in the unknowns. <p> The multihomogeneous form of every polynomial is, adopting the notation of <ref> [MM94] </ref>, X v ik r Y jh j i = 1; : : : ; r; k = 1; : : : ; l i ; where v are constant coefficients, are variables and the sum ranges over the strategies of all agents excluding i. <p> These systems are not exactly multigraded because some terms have zero coefficients, but we can nonetheless obtain rather compact resultant formulae. The simplest system with more than one solution has type (1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1) and is discussed in <ref> [MM94] </ref>. This system resembles the one modeling the inverse kinematics of the cyclic molecule in section 5.2 because the Newton polytopes here are scaled copies of those. Thus the same approaches can be used for solving the system.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of the algorithm is rather satisfactory given that the mixed volume problem is equivalent, for the special case of unmixed systems, to the convex hull volume. The latter is known to be #P-hard [DF88, Kha93]. Moreover, it has recently been shown that mixed volume is #P-complete <ref> [Ped94] </ref> by a reduction of computing the permanent. For most practical applications the extra hypotheses are satisfied and the tighter bound m O (n) applies. Nevertheless, the complexity is asymptotically comparable to the naive algorithm of section 2.3.

Reference-contexts: The assumption on the type of lifting used has been removed by Sturmfels [Stu94]. For solving systems of polynomial equations, certain properties of the sparse resultant must be established. This was essentially accomplished in <ref> [PS94] </ref>, where it was shown that certain monomials defined during the computation of mixed volume constitute a basis of the coordinate ring associated to 10 the variety of the given polynomials. Section 4.1 offers a simpler proof based on our sparse resultant algorithm. <p> First we consider monomial bases of the coordinate ring defined by the polynomial ideal and show how their computation reduces to calculating mixed volume. The proof follows immediately form our resultant construction and is simpler than the first demonstration <ref> [PS94] </ref>. Monomial bases lead to multiplication maps which provide a standard method for calculating isolated solutions. Depending on the lifting, different bases and multiplication maps (or tables) may be obtained. Similarly, these maps may be specified by a Grobner basis with respect to a given term ordering. <p> chapter concludes with a discussion of our implementation and the practical issues that arise thereof. 4.1 Monomial Bases For n generic Laurent polynomials f 1 ; : : : ; f n in n variables, the definition of monomial bases from mixed subdivisions was first demonstrated by Pedersen and Sturmfels <ref> [PS94] </ref>. Their proof relies on reducing the general problem to binomial systems via Puiseux series. Theorem 4.1.3 verifies their result.

Reference-contexts: Ronga and Vust [RV92] offered the first proof of 40 being an upper bound by applying intersection theory on vector bundles and using Chern classes. Simpler proofs were proposed in [Mou93, Laz93] and a probabilistic one in <ref> [Rag93] </ref>. A second proof by Mourrain [Mou94] views this problem as well as the computation of the camera motion from 5 point matches as special cases of a general problem on displacements. Wampler [Wam94] arrives at the upper bound by applying the multi-homogeneous Bezout bound to an appropriate polynomial system.

Reference-contexts: A survey can be found in [Mis93, ch. 5]. A related approach is Hong's [Hon86], which suffers from the same shortcomings. Recent advances indicate that resultants may be the method of choice in geometric theorem proving.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively the roots may be represented as the values of rational functions at the zeros of a resultant polynomial <ref> [Ren87] </ref>. The method applies to zero-dimensional varieties but fails when the homogenized system has excess components at infinity.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we should study the extent to which some combination of these approaches may be fruitful. Invariably, resultants are used in the most efficient methods for quantifier elimination and decision procedures for the theory of the reals <ref> [Gri88, Can88a, Ren92, BPR94] </ref>. If the given polynomials are sparse in the current sense, the sparse resultant would be the natural choice in all of these methods.

Reference-contexts: Polynomial system solving can be reduced to an eigenproblem via the construction of multiplication maps constructed by a Grobner basis computation. Multiplicities complicate this approach and have been recently addressed in [MS94]. Another approach pioneered by Ritt and generalized by Wu <ref> [Rit50, Wu84] </ref> consists of computing the characteristic set of the given polynomials. It has led to positive results in elementary geometric theorem proving where the polynomial system is triangular or nearly so. The characteristic set is easy to solve and its zero set is roughly equivalent to the original one.

Reference-contexts: Equality holds when all coefficients are generic. Canny and Rojas have substantially weakened the requirements for equality [CR91] by requiring only the coefficients corresponding to Newton polytope vertices to be generic. A further combinatorial specification of which coefficients must be generic was proposed in <ref> [Roj94] </ref>. Fulton states a slight generalization of Khovanskii's version that applies to arbitrary varieties, including infinite ones. Consider the intersection multiplicity of the hypersurfaces defined by the given polynomials at an isolated common root ff. This number is a positive integer and equals one exactly when the hypersurfaces meet transversally. <p> Of course, for generic polynomials all intersections are isolated and transversal and equality holds. Another recent extension to Bernstein's theorem provides an upper bound on the number of common roots in C n ; see also <ref> [Kho78, Roj94] </ref> for related work.

Reference-contexts: Both methods are used for various instances in order for all roots to be calculated accurately. Lastly, section 5.3 discusses our progress towards solving the forward kinematics of the Stewart platform in real time, which is arguably "the major outstanding problem in all of manipulator direct and inverse kinematics" <ref> [Rot93] </ref>. Our resultant-based approach offers the first closed form of the solutions. Different algebraic formulations are suggested to compute the roots and their advantages and drawbacks considered. 5.1 Camera Motion from Point Matches Camera motion reconstruction, or relative orientation, in its various forms is a basic problem in photogrammetry.

Reference-contexts: An upper bound of 40 has been established in the past few years, which is exact because there exist particular instances with as many complex solutions. Ronga and Vust <ref> [RV92] </ref> offered the first proof of 40 being an upper bound by applying intersection theory on vector bundles and using Chern classes.

Reference-contexts: The main premise for this interaction is the observation 84 that various structural requirements on molecules can be modeled as macroscopic geometric or kinematic constraints. One example is the docking problem which examines the ways in which a ligand molecule attaches to a receptor site, see e.g. <ref> [SBK92] </ref>. If the docking match involves six pairs of atoms, then computing the ligand pose from the preferred bond distances is identical to the forward kinematics of the Stewart platform (see sect. 5.3).

Reference-contexts: Every cell boundary is a cell in of dimension n 1. The random choice is not generic if ffi lies in any of these boundaries. For each, the probability of failure is at most 1=S by Schwartz's 44 lemma <ref> [Sch80, lem. 1] </ref>. Now we have to bound the number of (n 1)-dimensional cells in . We know that each maximal cell has volume at least 1=n!. The number of integer lattice points in a polytope is asymptotically equal to its volume [Ehr67]. <p> Thus we have an almost guaranteed method of constructing the resultant at the cost of adding the single variable u. More precisely, to bound the probability of failure by 1=c for some arbitrary c 1 it suffices <ref> [Sch80, lem. 1] </ref>, to pick the coefficients of each h i uniformly distributed and independently, each with log (cjEj) bits. It is possible to detect failure deterministically, in which case new randomized variables must be chosen. <p> Again we choose polynomials h i with random coefficients, whose size is given in <ref> [Sch80, lem. 1] </ref>, and specialize (f 1 ; : : : ; f n+1 ) 7! (g 1 + uh 1 ; : : : ; g n+1 + uh n+1 ): By Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, R will remain irreducible over Q [u] after almost all such specializations. <p> Assume they are uniformly and independently distributed in an integer set of cardinality S. If M is of dimension r, then the probability is bounded by r=S <ref> [Sch80, lem. 1] </ref>. In the main algorithm, computing one convex hull vertex set requires at most linear programming tests implying that the bit complexity is (n) O (1) L d . The cardinality of an integer point set is asymptotically bounded by the volume of their convex hull [Ehr67]. <p> The total number of polynomials appearing at the numerator or denominator of a branch expression is at most 2 3 T , where T is the maximum number of branches on any execution path. Schwartz's lemma <ref> [Sch80] </ref> requires that the range of the random values contains at least as many values as the product of c and the total degree of the polynomial whose roots we wish to avoid. <p> Since D bounds the total degree of any polynomial g, the total degree of G is at most 2 3 T D. Now we apply a lemma proven in <ref> [Sch80] </ref>. The probability that r, chosen uniformly at random with the given size, is a root of G (a + 1r) is at most 1=c.

Reference-contexts: For a degenerate input the output may be of constant size while, under the perturbation, the given algorithm cannot do significantly better than what its worst-case performance predicts. The next section proposes a syntactic definition of perturbations as applied to the degeneracy problem, based on Seidel's treatment <ref> [Sei94] </ref>. The key notion of valid perturbations is introduced to capture the desired properties of perturbations that will let algorithms defined on generic instances be applied to arbitrary ones. Section 6.2 describes previous work in the area, in particular on efficient geometric perturbations. <p> All inputs not dealt with by a program can be modeled by the vanishing of some polynomial in the input. Conforming to the standard viewpoint in the literature <ref> [EM90, Yap90b, EC95, Sei94] </ref> we have Definition 6.1.5 An input instance is degenerate with respect to some program, if and only if it causes some numerator or denominator polynomial f at a branch to vanish, where f is not identically zero. <p> Yap in [Yap90b] deals with the more general setting in which branching occurs at arbitrary rational expressions and proposes a method which is equivalent to an infinitesimal perturbation, as proven in [Yap90a]. It has been extended to analytic test functions by Seidel <ref> [Sei94] </ref>.

Newton polytopes are also instrumental in the work of Viro on real algebraic curves of prescribed topology [Vir84, Vir86].

Reference-contexts: The first algorithm uses a lifting of the given Newton polytopes to n + 1 dimensions in order to define a unique subdivision of their Minkowski sum. The assumption on the type of lifting used has been removed by Sturmfels <ref> [Stu94] </ref>. For solving systems of polynomial equations, certain properties of the sparse resultant must be established. <p> Let denote the set of all maximal cells or equivalently their convex hulls; defines a subdivision of polytope Q. There exist several subdivisions of Q. To specify a particular one we follow the approach of <ref> [BS92, Stu94] </ref>. <p> In other words, the coarsest common refinement of the sublattices generated by each A i . Suppose this sublattice has rank n and is thus identified with Z n ; in what follows, it is assumed that this has already been done by means of the Smith normal form <ref> [Stu94] </ref>. The improved version of the first algorithm in section 3.1.6 removes this hypothesis. The first algorithm uses a mixed subdivision and was proposed in [CE93]. As in the previous chapter, a sufficiently generic lifting induces the subdivision of the Minkowski sum. <p> This is clearly a many-to-one mapping. We wish, for each q 2 Q, to define a unique inverse (p 1 ; : : : ; p n+1 ) under (3.1) in Q 1 fi fi Q n+1 . To this end a method from <ref> [Stu94] </ref> is employed: choose n + 1 sufficiently generic linear lifting forms l 1 ; : : : ; l n+1 2 Z [x 1 ; : : : ; x n ]. Genericity is typically implemented by randomly choosing the l i as in section 2.3. <p> Sturmfels <ref> [Stu94, sect. 2, 3] </ref> by generalizing the way the lifting functions l i are defined. Consider any monomial Q -ij ij in the input coefficients; the exponent vector lies in Z , where = 1 + + n+1 is the total number of coefficients. <p> This implies that the latter monomial is of minimum weight under l. Lemma 3.1.17 <ref> [Stu94, thm. 2.1] </ref> The product of the leading diagonal entries of M is a multiple of the trailing monomial of R with respect to l, which equals, for some constant c, c F Vol (F ) ij ; over all mixed facets F where F = + a ij + : <p> The determinant of M and its irreducible factor R have integer coefficients therefore, by Gauss' lemma, their quotient has integer coefficients.

Reference-contexts: We shall loosely bound MM (k) by O (k 3 ). It is known that inverting a matrix and computing its determinant and characteristic polynomial are all computationally equivalent to matrix multiply <ref> [vzG88] </ref>. We may occasionally compromise the tightness of the bounds in order to reduce the intricacy of the complexity formulae. In practice, most of the operations described here are not implemented with (exact) rational arithmetic but are instead carried out over floating point numbers of fixed size. <p> Theorem 6.5.3 Perturbation (6.4) is valid with respect to Orientation and Transversality. It increases the worst-case arithmetic and bit complexities of the Orientation and Transversality primitives by a O (log d) factor. Proof Validity follows from theorem 6.3.1. The original arithmetic complexity is fi (MM (d)) from <ref> [vzG88] </ref>. From corollary 6.4.4, the complexity on perturbed input is O (MM (d) log d). The original worst-case bit complexity depends on the size of the answer which is fi (ds).

Reference-contexts: This allows them to decouple some of the variables and obtain a 4 or even 3-dimensional system, however of high degree. A fast numerical implementation by Wampler <ref> [Wam93] </ref> solves the general problem to satisfactory precision in about 14 seconds on an IBM RS/6000, after some preprocessing. Recently, the problem has been reduced to the solution of a univariate polynomial of degree 40 by Husty [Hus94]; however solution of such polynomials may be highly unstable.

Reference-contexts: Simpler proofs were proposed in [Mou93, Laz93] and a probabilistic one in [Rag93]. A second proof by Mourrain [Mou94] views this problem as well as the computation of the camera motion from 5 point matches as special cases of a general problem on displacements. Wampler <ref> [Wam94] </ref> arrives at the upper bound by applying the multi-homogeneous Bezout bound to an appropriate polynomial system. Different approaches have been examined in computing the displacement. A sample of work on special cases is [NWM90, NZAJ91, WLW], where one or both platforms are planar or some ball-joint attachments coincide.

Reference-contexts: This is a well-defined problem and yields the common roots of the original system [GL89, ch. 7]. Another cubic method with lower practical complexity yet numerically less stable is based on the Kronecker canonical form <ref> [Wil78] </ref> which generalizes the Jordan form of numeric matrices. There exist square nonsingular matrices P; Q such that P (C 1 x + C 0 )Q is null except for the following four kinds of diagonal blocks.

Reference-contexts: Stewart [Ste65] introduced his platform to achieve these properties in flight simulation, while another fully parallel manipulator had already been proposed by Gough [Gou56]. Other applications exist including medical ones that rely on the accuracy of the mechanism to perform delicate operations <ref> [WS94] </ref>. The platform has one degree of freedom per joint; the position and orientation of the top platform is specified by six parameters, namely three for the orientation and three for the position in 3-space. Hence the problem is well-defined.

Reference-contexts: Polynomial system solving can be reduced to an eigenproblem via the construction of multiplication maps constructed by a Grobner basis computation. Multiplicities complicate this approach and have been recently addressed in [MS94]. Another approach pioneered by Ritt and generalized by Wu <ref> [Rit50, Wu84] </ref> consists of computing the characteristic set of the given polynomials. It has led to positive results in elementary geometric theorem proving where the polynomial system is triangular or nearly so. The characteristic set is easy to solve and its zero set is roughly equivalent to the original one.

Reference-contexts: Special interest has been exhibited in multihomogeneous systems, where for certain cases exact Sylvester-type formulae are obtained, i.e. matrices whose determinant equals the resultant exactly [SZ94]. These results are applied in section 3.3 and our second algorithm is shown to construct these formulae. A generalization of these results <ref> [WZ92] </ref>, covering a wider class of systems, has yet to offer a constructive approach. There exist several methods for solving polynomial systems, usually distinguished into algebraic methods, where root finding is viewed as a special case of eliminating variables, and numerical methods that typically rely on some iterative technique.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter we describe efficient methods for systematically coping with such degeneracies using symbolic infinitesimal perturbations. Our methods apply to every algorithm that can be implemented on a real RAM. This work is influenced by the treatment of the problem in [EM90] and, in a more general context, <ref> [Yap90b] </ref>. The main contribution of this article is to introduce the first general and efficient perturbations from the viewpoint of worst-case complexity. Previous methods incurred an extra computational cost that was exponential in some parameter of the input size. <p> All inputs not dealt with by a program can be modeled by the vanishing of some polynomial in the input. Conforming to the standard viewpoint in the literature <ref> [EM90, Yap90b, EC95, Sei94] </ref> we have Definition 6.1.5 An input instance is degenerate with respect to some program, if and only if it causes some numerator or denominator polynomial f at a branch to vanish, where f is not identically zero. <p> In [EM90] every such vector is associated with a minor that may have to be evaluated. Yap in <ref> [Yap90b] </ref> deals with the more general setting in which branching occurs at arbitrary rational expressions and proposes a method which is equivalent to an infinitesimal perturbation, as proven in [Yap90a].

Reference-contexts: For zero-dimensional affine varieties a tight upper bound on the complexity is d O (n) <ref> [Y.N90] </ref>, while the bit complexity is d O (n 2 ) ; see also [CGH89]. For zero-dimensional homogeneous varieties the arithmetic complexity is again d O (n) [HRS93]. Although Grobner bases perform significantly better than the worst-case bounds in several cases, they fail to take advantage of the polynomial structure.

Both algorithms are surveyed in <ref> [Zip90] </ref>. Traditionally, the cost of evaluating the unknown polynomial is of minor concern in the context of the interpolation problem, yet here this cost must be assessed. In general, computing the interpolation pairs takes time proportional to the number of pairs times the complexity of evaluating the polynomial.
