Abstract: This paper presents a pattern recognition approach to identifying contact formations from force sensor signals. The approach is sensor-based and does not use geometric models of the workpieces. The design of a fuzzy classifier is described, where membership functions are generated automatically from training data. The technique is demonstrated using supervised learning. Test results are included for experiments using both rigid and non-rigid workpieces. The technique is discussed in the context of robot programming by human demonstration.

Reference-contexts: While not yet coupled with vision, force signals have been incorporated into programming by demonstration systems, in order to learn compliant task strategies for assembly operations (e.g., the work of Delson and West [2], Asada and Izumi <ref> [1] </ref>, and Wang et al [12]). Much of this work concentrates on the low level servo control issues, attempting to learn the parameters for control functions that can be used for each subtask segment.

Reference-contexts: An approach to assembly operations which we believe can be combined with robot programming by demonstration is to model the assembly task as a sequence of discrete states, representing the contact formations (i.e., contact state) <ref> [3] </ref> between workpieces. In this way, the learning process can be simplified and the learned program should be more robust to discrepancies in position and orientation. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by Kosuge, Fukuda, and Asada in [9].

Reference-contexts: The utility of this approach was demonstrated by Kosuge, Fukuda, and Asada in [9]. However, the current methods used to identify the discrete contact states require a geometric model of the workpieces (e.g., <ref> [6, 8, 4] </ref>. Often uncertainty and friction are ignored, and the process can still be complex for even simple workpieces. In addition, ambiguities may prevent the identification of the one correct contact formation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present a sensor-based scheme for identifying contact formations which does not use geometric models of the workpieces. In contrast to the method used by McCarragher in [10], our method is based on a quasi-static contact condition. Similar to the approach used in <ref> [5] </ref>, our method uses fuzzy logic to model and recognize the sensory patterns and also resolve the inherent ambiguities. In addition to its pattern recognition strengths, fuzzy logic provides a linguistic interface to the human demonstrator, which makes it particularly well-suited to the programming by demonstration method.

Figures 1 and 2 show example force and moment patterns for several measurements on 2 vertex-to-surface contact formations. This data was collected using the block shown in Figure 3 in contact with a flat plate. <p> Each class represents a unique CF. An example is the classifier developed by Hirai and Asada, which uses a geometric model to build polyhedral convex cones that approximate the sensory patterns <ref> [6] </ref>. We propose, as a sensor-based mations pattern classifier, the use of fuzzy logic. Empirical training data, instead of geometric models, is used to learn the sensory patterns. Fuzzy membership functions are used to represent the patterns.

Reference-contexts: The method provides a natural approach to human-robot interaction and at the same time, avoids much of the computational complexity found in model-based program generation.

While useful for observing high-level task information, vision has so far has not proven adequate for observing intricate assembly operations. Capabilities of such vision systems could be expanded with the use of force-based skills.

An event is defined as the change in contact formation, which can be recognized by monitoring the force signals. A sudden change in any of the force components indicates that an event has occurred, resulting in a loss or gain of contact.

An American Robot Merlin robot arm was used with an attached JR3 force sensor. Force signals were logged at a low frequency (2 Hz).

Reference-contexts: As the curve drops off, this models the effect of the sensor uncertainty. Returning to the structure of the expanded fuzzy rule, we can see that a fuzzy conjunction operator is needed to combine the 6 membership functions. In this case, the Hamacher product <ref> [14] </ref> is used.
