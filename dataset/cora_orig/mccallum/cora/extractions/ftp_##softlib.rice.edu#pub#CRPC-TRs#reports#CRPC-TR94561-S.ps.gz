Title: Implementation of the Conjugate Gradient Algorithm in DSO  
Author: Susan E. Minkoff 
Date: July 11, 1994  
Abstract: Computation of the inner state parameters in DSO inversion requires solving a large normal matrix system. A combined conjugate gradient and Lanczos iterative technique can be used to both solve the system and approximate some of the spectrum of the normal operator. At each iteration of the conjugate gradient algorithm, a small tridiagonal matrix (of dimension equal to the number of iterations) is created which has extreme eigenvalues approximating those of the original matrix. A second matrix whose columns are the normalized residual vectors from the conjugate gradient algorithm allows the corresponding eigenvectors to be computed as well if desired. Implemented so that it can be applied to different DSO inversion problems, the conjugate gradient code provides the user with a tool to analyze the condition of the problem as well as the quality of the inversion results. Storage of the residual (Lanczos) vectors may be costly if large problems are being solved. Numerical experiments indicate that the largest eigenvalue is the best approximation in the spectrum and the smallest is generally the next best.

Reference-contexts: The header information which indicates the total number of records in the file is incremented, and the updated records 1; :::; j 1 are rewritten to the file before record j is added. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix are estimated using the LAPACK routine SSTEQR <ref> [ANDERSON et al., 1992] </ref>. This routine computes all of the eigenvalues and, optionally, the eigenvectors of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the implicit QL or QR method. The eigenvalues are ordered according to size from smallest to largest on exit from this package.

Reference-contexts: They indicate which components of the model are the least and best determined. Finally, they provide a way to measure how well or poorly one set of inversion model parameters compares with another. (For a reference to the conjugate gradient and Lanczos algorithms see <ref> [GOLUB and LOAN, 1989] </ref>. For a discussion of the algorithmic construction of DSO see [SYMES and KERN, 1994]) DSO contains code modules (for example, optimization software) which are used by all modeling and inversion experiments performed in our group and modules written for specific applications (i.e., forward modeling code). <p> The next section describes the conjugate gradient and Lanczos algorithms in general terms. (The following general description of the two algorithms may be found in expanded form in <ref> [GOLUB and LOAN, 1989] </ref>.) 3 Discussion of the Conjugate Gradient and Lanczos Al gorithms 3.1 The Conjugate Gradient Idea The Hestenes-Stiefel conjugate gradient algorithm may be understood in the context of minimizing the function (x) defined by (x) = 2 where b*&lt; n , and A*&lt; nfin is assumed to be <p> The output eigenvectors X of A also must be stored as formatted files. In order to write the records of the output matrix X only once and thus save on total i/o, we used the Gaxpy version of the matrix-matrix product. The Gaxpy algorithm can be found in <ref> [GOLUB and LOAN, 1989] </ref> and is repeated here.
