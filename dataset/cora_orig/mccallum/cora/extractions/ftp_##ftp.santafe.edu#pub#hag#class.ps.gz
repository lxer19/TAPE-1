Title: Abstract  
Abstract: A central issue in the theory of cellular automata is classification. A classification is a structure imposed on the space of automata which groups together cellular automata with related properties. In this paper a classification based on the action of cellular automata on n-step Markov measures is presented. This classification is hierarchical and parametric. An algorithm is described which efficiently constructs all rules in a given class at a given level of the hierarchy. The utility of the classification is explored in the study of the invariant statistical properties of next-nearest neighbor cellular automata on two states per cell.

Reference-contexts: This classification depends in general on lattice structure and 35 dimension, number of states of cells and the radius of the rules. A disadvantage of the Wolfram classification scheme is class membership is undecidable <ref> [1] </ref>. Membership in an Markov class is simply decided. Given a rule, one may decide which class at a given order it belongs to by evaluating the coefficient values for the rule in the given order of approximation. <p> Similarly, P <ref> [1] </ref> n1 0 = P 0 [1] n1 . Hence, [0] n1 1 is of the same type as 1 [0] n1 for any n &gt; 0, and similarly 0 [1] n1 is of the same type as [1] n1 0 for any n &gt; 0. <p> Similarly, P <ref> [1] </ref> n1 0 = P 0 [1] n1 . Hence, [0] n1 1 is of the same type as 1 [0] n1 for any n &gt; 0, and similarly 0 [1] n1 is of the same type as [1] n1 0 for any n &gt; 0. <p> Similarly, P <ref> [1] </ref> n1 0 = P 0 [1] n1 . Hence, [0] n1 1 is of the same type as 1 [0] n1 for any n &gt; 0, and similarly 0 [1] n1 is of the same type as [1] n1 0 for any n &gt; 0. Condition 2) for blocks to be of the same type does not require anything of the probability assignments to m-blocks except that they be consistent. <p> Similarly, P <ref> [1] </ref> n1 0 = P 0 [1] n1 . Hence, [0] n1 1 is of the same type as 1 [0] n1 for any n &gt; 0, and similarly 0 [1] n1 is of the same type as [1] n1 0 for any n &gt; 0. Condition 2) for blocks to be of the same type does not require anything of the probability assignments to m-blocks except that they be consistent. <p> In view of condition 1) however, if the exterior exponents satisfy #[[0] m1 1](b) + #[1 [0] m1 ](b) = and #[<ref> [1] </ref> m1 0](b 0 ) + #[0 [1] m1 ](b); (18) and the interior exponents satisfy #[[0] m2 1](b) + #[1 [0] m2 ](b) = and #[[1] m2 0](b 0 ) + #[0 [1] m2 ](b); (20) then b and b 0 will have the same probability by equation (12) if the other exponents have the same values <p> 1) however, if the exterior exponents satisfy #[[0] m1 1](b) + #[1 [0] m1 ](b) = and #[<ref> [1] </ref> m1 0](b 0 ) + #[0 [1] m1 ](b); (18) and the interior exponents satisfy #[[0] m2 1](b) + #[1 [0] m2 ](b) = and #[[1] m2 0](b 0 ) + #[0 [1] m2 ](b); (20) then b and b 0 will have the same probability by equation (12) if the other exponents have the same values for the two blocks.

Reference-contexts: The 2nd-order estimate (equation 8) involves a number of different block probabilities raised to different, interrelated, powers. A good code should specify the minimum number of exponent values such that the rest can be found by appeal to the Kolmogorov consistency conditions on block probabilities <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In general, cellular automata with very similar transition rules may behave quite differently, while cellular automata with very different transition rule may behave identically. The approach taken here is to classify cellular automata according to their action on probability measures. It was shown previously <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref> that the action of cellular automata on probability measures can be approximated by their action on n-step Markov measures. An n-step Markov measure is a measure generated by Markov process with n steps of "memory". <p> As n is increased this approximation typically becomes an increasingly faithful representation of the action of the cellular automaton on general measures. This sequence of approximations for one-dimensional cellular automata was introduced in <ref> [3] </ref> under the name of local structure theory. It was ex 2 tended to cellular automata in higher dimensions in [4, 5]. To emphasize the Markovian nature of the approximation in one dimension, the local structure theory will be referred to here as the Markov approximation. <p> That the extension of small block probabilities defined by equation (8) is a consistent assignment of probabilities to larger blocks is proven in <ref> [3] </ref>. That this extension is the extension of maximum entropy consistent with the given assignment of 2-block probabilities is proven in [12]. Blocks which always have the same probability according to equation (8) are said to be of the same 2nd-order type. <p> Also, as order increases the tails of the distributions become longer. This reflects the fact, as shown also in figure 3, that though accuracy typically improves with order, for some classes of rules, prediction actually deteriorates with increase in order. This phenomenon has been observed previously <ref> [3, 5] </ref> in studies of individual cellular automaton rules. Rules in a given class have a distribution of invariant statistical properties. From the results of figure 4, this distribution is typically centered near the fixed-point measure of the system of equations which define the class.

Reference-contexts: We have seen that the members of such a class of rules tend to share statistical properties. Research is under way to use the Markov classification to direct searches for cellular automata with specified properties <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. In the present work, the coefficients values in the Markov approximation were considered fixed, and the properties of the corresponding rules examined. In work in progress, the coefficients are treated as parameters. Properties of the equations are 34 studied as the parameter values vary.

Reference-contexts: An alternative basis may be useful in some situations. For instance, in order to minimize the values of the coefficients in the Markov equations for particular rules, one should choose basis blocks which are in a certain sense minimal <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.13 Assignment of Coefficient Values The nth-order Markov consists of 2 n1 equations each of which describes the evolution of the probability of a block in the basis set as chosen above. 2 n2 of these equations describe the evolution of the probability of an n-block, 2 n3 equations describe

Reference-contexts: In particular, the prediction of 0th-order approximation for the invariant density of a rule is the density of the rule table. Though crude, the 0th-order approximation can yield good qualitative predictions. Langton <ref> [9] </ref> used the 0th-order approximation to explore information processing in two-dimensional cellular automata. of equation (4) follows his notation. Packard and Li [11] have employed similar methods to locate boundaries in the space of cellular automata between rules with different kinds of behavior.

Reference-contexts: APPROXIMATION 2.1 The Action of a Cellular Automaton on a Probab ility Measure The probability measure t which results from then application of a cellular automaton t to a probability measure is given by t (E) = (t 1 (E)); (1) where E is a -measurable open set of configurations <ref> [10] </ref>. The usual topology on the set of configurations is derived from the metric d (x; y) = P inf inf 2 jij jx i y i j where x and y are configurations, and i indexes position with respect to a fixed origin.

Reference-contexts: An n-step Markov measure is generated by a Markov process with n steps of "memory". Here the memory is not temporal, but spatial. The "states" of an n-step Markov process are blocks of n cell states. It is well known (see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>), that the assignment of probability in this way to long blocks is the assignment of maximum entropy consistent with the given n-block probabilities. By Markov measure we mean the assignment of probability by a Markov process to blocks of all sizes. <p> That the extension of small block probabilities defined by equation (8) is a consistent assignment of probabilities to larger blocks is proven in [3]. That this extension is the extension of maximum entropy consistent with the given assignment of 2-block probabilities is proven in <ref> [12] </ref>. Blocks which always have the same probability according to equation (8) are said to be of the same 2nd-order type.

In most applications it should be possible to limit attention to a subset of the possible Markov classes. Consider, for example, so-called totalistic rules <ref> [14] </ref>, under which the state of a cell depends only on the sum of the states in a neighborhood. Totalistic rules occupy mean field classes for which each coefficient has either the value 0 or its maximum allowed value.
