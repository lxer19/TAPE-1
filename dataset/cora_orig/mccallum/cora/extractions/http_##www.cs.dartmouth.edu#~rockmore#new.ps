Abstract: In this paper we present fast algorithms for computing discrete orthogonal polynomial transforms. For a system of N orthogonal polynomials of degree at most N 1 we give an O(N log 2 N ) algorithm for computing a discrete polynomial transform at an arbitrary set of points instead of the N 2 operations required by direct evaluation. Our algorithm depends only on the fact that orthogonal polynomial sets satisfy a three-term recurrence and thus it may be applied to any such set of discrete sampled functions. In particular, sampled orthogonal polynomials generate the vector space of functions on a distance transitive graph. As a direct application of our work we are able to give a fast algorithm for computing subspace decompositions of this vector space which respect the action of the symmetry group of such a graph. This has direct applications to treating computational bottlenecks in the spectral analysis of data on distance transitive graphs and we discuss this in some detail.

Reference-contexts: We proceed by first recalling the fast monomial transform. This is obtained by writing it as the transpose of multiple-point polynomial evaluation and then formulating a well-known efficient algorithm for the latter process (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, Chapter 4) as a structured matrix factorization. <p> to be the n th roots of unity in C , z ` = exp ( 2i` n ): This projection may be obtained by the familiar FFT divide and conquer strategy in O (n log n) operations as opposed to the obvious O (n 2 ): General references include <ref> [BM, ER, N, TAL] </ref>. Notice that the abelian FFT gives rise to our first efficient spherical transform, corresponding to the n-gon graph. This is a fast discrete Chebyshev transform with samples at the Chebyshev points, cos 2` n . <p> This version of the FFT is achieved by efficient recursive application of the division algorithm (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>). An advantage of this perspective is that it allows an easy generalization to the direct evaluation of polynomials at n real points. <p> Notice that fast polynomial arithmetic algorithms allow for the various moduli to be precomputed in O (n log 2 n) operations (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, Section 4.3). 5 Each downward edge in the tree in Figure 1 represents the reduction of a polynomial p (x) modulo another polynomial of form m S (z) = z j 2S (z z j ); corresponding to a certain subset S of the evaluation points z 0 ; :::; <p> Its inverse, G; is also lower triangular and Toeplitz, and may be computed in O (d log d) operations by a Newton iteration and then prestored (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, Chapter 4 as well as Remark 3 following the proof). Multiply equation (6) by G; and insert the result into equation (5). <p> Thus, in total three FFT's are required as well as one pointwise multiplication of a sequence of length 2b. If 2b = 2 r then an FFT of length 2b requires at most 3 2 2b r = 3br operations (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 84). Consequently, the multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix of order b = 2 r1 by an arbitrary vector requires at most 3 3br + 2b operations or O (b log b) operations. <p> These may be generated recursively from the bottom of the tree up, using efficient polynomial multiplication routines which require O (m log m) operations to multiply two polynomials of degree m.( cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 86). Thus, at most O (n log 2 n) operations are needed to generate all M l;i and the G 1 l;i ( cf. [BM], p. 100). <p> of the tree up, using efficient polynomial multiplication routines which require O (m log m) operations to multiply two polynomials of degree m.( cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 86). Thus, at most O (n log 2 n) operations are needed to generate all M l;i and the G 1 l;i ( cf. [BM], p. 100). Finally, to invert any particular G 1 l;i in order to obtain G l;i an additional O (l 2 l ) is needed ( cf. [BM], p. 96), so that in total, we require O (n log 2 n) operations to precompute the necessary data structure. 4. <p> at most O (n log 2 n) operations are needed to generate all M l;i and the G 1 l;i ( cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 100). Finally, to invert any particular G 1 l;i in order to obtain G l;i an additional O (l 2 l ) is needed ( cf. [BM], p. 96), so that in total, we require O (n log 2 n) operations to precompute the necessary data structure. 4. Notice that one direct result of an efficient monomial transform is that we can obtain an FFT at nonuniformly spaced frequencies.

Serre's book <ref> [S] </ref> provides a nice introduction to the representation theory of finite groups. 23 Throughout, X is a distance transitive graph: Thus, X is a finite metric space with integer--valued distance d (taken to be the usual distance of shortest path on the graph) with G a group of isometries of X <p> It is easy to check that if f and g are H-invariant then their convolution is as well. As a complex representation space for a finite group G, L 2 (X) may be decomposed into G-irreducible subspaces (cf. <ref> [S] </ref>, Section 1.4, Theorem 2). In the general situation of decomposing the permutation representation arising from a finite group G acting transitively on a set X, this irreducible decomposition need not be unique. However, under the assumption of distance transitivity, an irreducible decomposition is indeed unique. <p> We choose a basis vector i for this subspace by demanding that i (x 0 ) = 1. Note that this is possible, since the previous reference or Frobenious Reciprocity (cf. <ref> [S] </ref>) shows the existence of some nonzero H-fixed element (hence constant on each of the k ) i 2 V i .

As shown in <ref> [St1] </ref>, by evaluating the eigenvalue equation (37) at k we move the recurrence (35) to the i : where for any x 2 k , fl k = j fz : z 2 k+1 and d (x; z) = 1g j; fi k = j fz : z 2 k1 and <p> As remarked, the polynomial nature follows from the polynomial relation of the D i .

As we have already seen, these are orthogonal polynomials satisfying a three-term recurrence, equation 3.3.

Reference-contexts: More generally, the k-sets of an n-set comprise a distance transitive graph by joining any two k-sets which differ by only a single element. This graph possesses certain Hahn polynomials as its spherical functions (cf. <ref> [St3] </ref>, Section II.3). Other examples include the n-gon graph, with dihedral group symmetry as well as the n-dimensional hypercube with hyperoctahedral group of symmetries. <p> In the former case the spherical functions are obtained from the Chebyshev polynomials, T n (x) = cos (n arccos (x)) [Bi] and in the latter, the Krawtchouk polynomials give the spherical functions (cf. <ref> [St3] </ref>, Section II.2). <p> In many important examples, (cf. <ref> [St1, St3] </ref> and the many references therein) these spherical functions are actually sampled orthogonal polynomials, and the spherical transform amounts to projection onto these polynomials in 3 a weighted ` 2 space. <p> We mainly follow Stanton's expositions <ref> [St1, St3] </ref> which are very accessible and provide a wealth of references.

Reference-contexts: Applied science abounds with computations using such decompositions, along with the related computational techniques for calculation of correlation or projection of data onto a family of polynomials. To cite just a few examples, this sort of approach is used in spectral methods for solving differential equations <ref> [Bo, Te] </ref>, data analysis [D], signal and image processing [OS], and the construction of Gauss quadrature schemes [Ga1]. In most cases, the choice of a particular family of polynomials is determined by some special property or underlying symmetry of the problem under investigation.

Notice that the abelian FFT gives rise to our first efficient spherical transform, corresponding to the n-gon graph. This is a fast discrete Chebyshev transform with samples at the Chebyshev points, cos 2` n .

Reference-contexts: The proof of this theorem is not crucial for the main results, but it is worth remarking that it depends only on the fact that G acts two-point homogeneously on X and as such is a general fact about permutation representations (cf. <ref> [W] </ref>, Chapter 5, Section 29).
