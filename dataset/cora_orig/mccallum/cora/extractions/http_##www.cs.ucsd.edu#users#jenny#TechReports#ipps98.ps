Title: Proceedings of IPPS/SPDP '98 Performance Prediction in Production Environments

Abstract: Accurate performance predictions are difficult to achieve for parallel applications executing on production distributed systems. Conventional point-valued performance parameters and prediction models are often inaccurate since they can only represent one point in a range of possible behaviors. We address this problem by allowing characteristic application and system data to be represented by a set of possible values and their probabilities, which we call stochastic values. In this paper, we give a practical methodology for using stochastic values as parameters to adaptable performance prediction models. We demonstrate their usefulness for a distributed SOR application, showing stochastic values to be more effective than single (point) values in predicting the range of application behavior that can occur during execution in production environments.

Reference-contexts: For each arithmetic operation, we define a rule for combining stochastic values based on standard statistical error propagation methods <ref> [Bar78] </ref>. In the following, we assume that point values are represented by P and all stochastic values are of the form X i a i and represent normal distributions, where X i is the mean and a i is two standard deviations.

Reference-contexts: By assuming that the distributions associated with the stochastic values are normal, we can take advantage of the fact 4 that normal distributions are closed under linear combina-tions <ref> [LM86] </ref> to define straightforward rules for combining stochastic values. For each arithmetic operation, we define a rule for combining stochastic values based on standard statistical error propagation methods [Bar78].

Reference-contexts: Similarly, component models were defined for RedComm p and BlackComm p . Due to space constraints, we refer interested readers to <ref> [SB97] </ref> for details. 2.3 Arithmetic Operations over Stochastic Values To calculate stochastic values for the left-hand side of structural modeling equations, the right-hand side stochastic values may need to be combined arithmetically. <p> These formulas are outlined below and discussed in depth in <ref> [SB97] </ref> When combining two stochastic values, two cases must be considered: when the distributions are related and when they are unrelated. Two distributions are related when there is a causal connection between their values. <p> In contrast, the 6 average difference between the actual execution times and the means of the modeled normal stochastic values exhibits a maximum error of 38.6%. system with bursty load. These results are typical. We performed experiments for a number of problem sizes with similar results <ref> [SB97] </ref>. For all problem sizes, 74% of the actual execution times fell within the range delineated by the stochastic predictions.

Reference-contexts: Whereas a point value gives a single value for a quantity, a stochastic value gives a set of possible values weighted by probabilities to represent a range of likely behavior. Conventional performance prediction models cannot take advantage of model parameters that are stochastic values. In <ref> [Sch97] </ref> we defined a performance prediction model representationcalled structural modelingthat reflects the time-dependent dynamic mix of application performance activities occurring during execution in a production environment. <p> In the next section we show how normal stochastic data may be used to predict application performance. 2.2 Structural Modeling In this section we define and demonstrate the use of stochastic values as inputs to performance prediction models. We focus on performance prediction models represented as structural models <ref> [Sch97] </ref>. Structural models provide a flexible and adaptable mechanism for predicting application performance in dynamic production systems. By parameterizing such models with stochastic values, we can calculate performance predictions that are also stochastic values.

Reference-contexts: However, for other production systems and applications (such as the systems we used in our experiments), stochastic data that reflects dynamically changing modal values is required. For our experiments, we use values generated by the Network Weather Service <ref> [Wol96] </ref> at runtime for our predictions. In this paper we assume that data can be adequately represented by a normal distribution.
