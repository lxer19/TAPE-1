Title: Search Party: An Approach to Reliable Multicast with Local Recovery (work in progress)  
Author: Adam M. Costello 
Date: 14 Sep 1997  
Abstract: Some applications, like software updates and distributed whiteboard, can benefit from a reliable mul-ticast service, which can be built on top of the unreliable IP multicast service. Existing approaches have limited feasibility, scalability, or robustness. The new search party approach addresses these limitations. Analytic results appear promising enough to warrant simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The IP multicast service <ref> [DC90] </ref> allows a source to send packets unreliably to a group of N members much more efficiently than sending N unicast packets. Some applications, like real-time audio and video broadcasting, are delay-sensitive and loss-tolerant, and thus well-suited to IP multicast service.

Reference-contexts: Reliable protocols involving a single sender and receiver invariably have the receiver send feedback to the sender, so the sender knows when it needs to send retransmissions. But if multiple receivers send feedback to a single sender, the 1 More recently proposed multicast routing protocols like PIM <ref> [DEF + 94] </ref> and CBT [BFC93] can use shared trees, in which the source is not the root, but this paper restricts its attention to source-rooted trees. 2 A single host can play all three roles, but this paper treats them as logically distinct entities. 3 Actually, the situation is more

Reference-contexts: Some applications, like real-time audio and video broadcasting, are delay-sensitive and loss-tolerant, and thus well-suited to IP multicast service. But other applications that could benefit from efficient multicasting require reliable delivery. Some are real-time, like distributed whiteboard <ref> [FJL + 97] </ref> and multiplayer games, while others are bulk transfers, like software updates and news articles. To support these applications, we need a reliable multi-cast protocol to handle detection and retransmission of lost packets. To forward multicast packets, IP routers use distribution trees. <p> Various other implementations could be used to perform the same operation. This paper uses the term subcast to refer to any of them (see figure 1). The router at the root of the subtree is called the exploder. 2.2 SRM In Scalable Reliable Multicast <ref> [FJL + 97] </ref>, members multicast repair requests to the entire group, but use random timers to ensure that only about one request is sent at a time. Other members waiting to send the same request see the first one and suppress their own. <p> Any member capable of responding to a request may do so, and random timers are used again to limit the number of responses to about one. SRM therefore avoids implosion, but does not provide local recovery, because every recovery involves the entire tree. Section 7.2 of <ref> [FJL + 97] </ref> sketches a few potential ideas for local recovery in SRM, but their efficacy is not evaluated. 2.3 Replier The replier-based scheme [PPV97] enlists the routers to provide a new (but simple) forwarding service. <p> Requests and responses must be handled differently when router addresses are not used. Requests contain the depth D of the exploder, plus a flag indicating whether the responder should subcast the response itself, or unicast it back to the requestor (an idea proposed in <ref> [FJL + 97] </ref>). If the responder subcasts the response, it must do so one level too high, at depth D 1, because the desired exploder is not an ancestor of the responder.

Reference-contexts: Every response contains a time reference copied from the request. The purpose of the time reference is not merely to avoid retranmission ambiguity <ref> [KP91] </ref>; it provides a sample r value to every member who sees the response, not just the one who sent the request. The sample value is the time the response is received minus the time the referenced data packet was received (if it was received) minus the offset.

In sender-initiated schemes, receivers send acks directly to the source, so they suffer from implosion.

Reference-contexts: This section examines one tree-based protocol (RMTP), one RINA protocol (SRM), and a newer protocol that does not fit well into the taxonomy (unnamed|this paper calls it "the replier-based scheme"). 2.1 RMTP The Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol <ref> [LP96] </ref> organizes the members into a hierarchy. acks are sent not to the source, but to the parent member. Internal nodes in the hierarchy (called Designated Receivers) are able to send retransmissions from their data caches. RMTP therefore provides both implosion avoidance and local recovery.

Reference-contexts: SRM therefore avoids implosion, but does not provide local recovery, because every recovery involves the entire tree. Section 7.2 of [FJL + 97] sketches a few potential ideas for local recovery in SRM, but their efficacy is not evaluated. 2.3 Replier The replier-based scheme <ref> [PPV97] </ref> enlists the routers to provide a new (but simple) forwarding service. Each router in a multicast tree selects one of its child links to be the replier link (except that the router immediately below the source selects its parent link). <p> delay cannot be predicted at all if the network is not working at time 0. 3.4.5 Examples of Tuning To see how application programs might tune the pro tocol to suit their own needs, let us consider three hypothetical applications. 7 This is a generalization of exposure as defined in <ref> [PPV97] </ref>. 10 Software update Suppose this application can tolerate arbitrary delays, but wants a probability of less than one in a billion that a retransmission will take longer than the discard timeout t disc , which we will suppose is ten minutes.

Reference-contexts: It follows that if m randomcast packets are sent from each of the L leaves in a subtree, the number of packets to escape the subtree has a binomial distribution with n = mL and p = 1=L, for which the expected value is np = m <ref> [Str89] </ref>. It is well-known that as n increases while np remains constant, the the binomial distribution assymptotically approaches the Poisson distribution with = np. Therefore, as L increases, the probability that k packets escape approaches m k k!e m (which is independent of L).
