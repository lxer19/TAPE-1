Reference-contexts: Large scale eigenvalue problems can be very difficult to solve, especially if a large number of eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors need to be computed. For solving this problem a multigrid preconditioned algorithm is presented in "The Davidson Algorithm, preconditioning and misconvergence" <ref> [2] </ref>. Another approach for solving eigenvalue problems is by developing efficient solutions for highly indefinite problems. In this paper we concentrate on the use of new highly indefinite multigrid algorithms (such as in Shapira's 1995 paper [3]) for the eigenvalue problem.

We have adopted the AutoMUG method <ref> [3, 4] </ref> as the multigrid solver because it is designed to achieve many of these properties. Perhaps the critical difference lies in its restriction to symmetric pentadiagonal matrices.

Even so, it seems to be very attractive as a first choice. Our first step is to bring the AutoMUG concept back to directly using a Schur complement approach. See <ref> [3] </ref> for a complete description of the method. Red-black (RB) ordering provides a natural way to parallelize linear systems arising from (2d + 1) point stencils for discretization of partial differential equations in d dimensions.
