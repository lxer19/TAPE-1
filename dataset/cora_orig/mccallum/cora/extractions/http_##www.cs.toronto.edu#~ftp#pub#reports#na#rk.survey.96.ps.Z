Title: Runge-Kutta Research at Toronto  
Author: T.E. Hull, W.H. Enright, K.R. Jackson 
Address: Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5S 3G4.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of  
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to review the work on Runge-Kutta methods at the University of Toronto during the period 1963 to the present (1996). To provide some background, brief mention is also made of related work on the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, but, with just a few exceptions, specific references are given only if the referenced material has a direct bearing on Runge-Kutta methods and their application to a variety of problem areas. There are several main themes. New Runge-Kutta formulas and new error control strategies are developed, leading for example to continuous methods and their application to areas such as delay, differential-algebraic and boundary-value problems. Software design and implementation are also emphasized. And so is the importance of careful testing and comparing. Other topics, such as the notion of effectiveness, taking advantage of parallelism, and handling discontinuities, are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: The students were Jim Ash, Wayne Enright, Gerry Gabel, Wayne Jackson, Sylvia Jones, Dereck Meek, Art Sedgwick and Neil Stewart. Vel Kahan was on the faculty during most of this period and was always ready with helpful advice and encouragement. In his MSc thesis Ash <ref> [1] </ref> introduced a hybrid program with control of the error per unit step. It used an Adams formula, but switched to the classic fourth-order Runge-Kutta formula for starting, changing step-size and stopping.

Reference-contexts: Some of the material discussed in the last two paragraphs is summarized in a survey paper by Jackson [53] on parallel methods for initial-value problems. In addition, the papers outlined above motivated three others by de Sterke, Jackson and Robert [9], Broderick, de Sterke and Jackson <ref> [2] </ref> and Jackson [54] in which Runge-Kutta predictor-corrector methods are applied to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations arising in optics. In addition, Enenkel's MSc research [11] has been extended by Enenkel and Jackson [13,14] and by Enenkel [12].

Reference-contexts: Two variable-order Adams methods developed by Krogh and by Sedgwick gave the best results. However, if the function evaluations are relatively inexpensive, extrapolation methods, such as those developed originally by Bulirsch and Stoer <ref> [3] </ref>, are usually more efficient; Runge-Kutta methods also behave well in such situations, but their good behaviour in each case is restricted to somewhat narrower ranges of tolerance, the more stringent tolerances requiring high 7 order methods.

Reference-contexts: One application that used Runge-Kutta formulas was done by our John Butcher <ref> [4] </ref>; he used them for parameter determination in a modelling experiment, under the supervision of Dave Shanno who was cross-appointed with the Faculty of Management Studies. Duncan [10] also used them to solve integral equations.

Reference-contexts: Some related work on solving large systems of ODEs has been carried out by Chan, Jackson and Zhu <ref> [7] </ref>, Chan and Jackson [5,6], Jackson [52] and Jackson and Seward [61], and is summarized in a survey paper by Jackson [55].

Reference-contexts: At first it appeared from existing textbooks that, for the latter, one should try to decide between Milne's method, an Adams method, and the classic fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Other possibilities soon arose however. Considerable inspiration was provided by Dahlquist through his famous 1956 paper <ref> [8] </ref>, and by Peter Henrici whose books [36,37] were in preparation during the late 1950's. This beginning culminated in several publications, one with Wim Luxemburg of CalTech and the others with students at UBC, namely Al Creemer, Lau-rie Johnston, Chris Newbery and Ray Zahar.

Reference-contexts: One application that used Runge-Kutta formulas was done by our John Butcher [4]; he used them for parameter determination in a modelling experiment, under the supervision of Dave Shanno who was cross-appointed with the Faculty of Management Studies. Duncan <ref> [10] </ref> also used them to solve integral equations. There were four main themes to our efforts during this period: design, implementation, proving properties, and comparisons.

Reference-contexts: The positive results are largely examples of prototypical formulas which offer a potential for effective "coarse-grain" parallelism on machines with a few processors. Runge-Kutta predictor-corrector methods have been discussed by Enenkel <ref> [11] </ref>, and analyzed by Jackson, Kvrnt and Ntrsett [57,58]. The results in the last two papers are of value not only for the development of parallel ODE codes, but also for the efficient, reliable and robust implementation of implicit Runge-Kutta methods on standard sequential machines. <p> In addition, the papers outlined above motivated three others by de Sterke, Jackson and Robert [9], Broderick, de Sterke and Jackson [2] and Jackson [54] in which Runge-Kutta predictor-corrector methods are applied to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations arising in optics. In addition, Enenkel's MSc research <ref> [11] </ref> has been extended by Enenkel and Jackson [13,14] and by Enenkel [12]. They derive a class of parallel general linear methods and provide numerical results that show the promise of this approach, although much 10 more work must be done before an effective parallel implementation can be developed.

Reference-contexts: They derive a class of parallel general linear methods and provide numerical results that show the promise of this approach, although much 10 more work must be done before an effective parallel implementation can be developed. Parallelism has also been used by Enright and Higham <ref> [20] </ref> to improve the reliability of continuous Runge-Kutta methods. Jackson and Pancer [60] investigate the parallel solution of the "almost block diagonal" systems of linear equations that arise in the numerical solution of boundary-value problems by Runge-Kutta methods and many other schemes.

Reference-contexts: Another theme is the development of parallel methods. Much of the work in this period is surveyed in a 1994 paper by Enright, Higham, Owren and Sharp <ref> [21] </ref>. Primary responsibility for the work on ODEs during this period was with En-right and Jackson. Tom Fairgrieve and Philip Sharp were also major contributors. Allan Jepson had an interest in the methods being developed because of their usefulness in solving problems that arise in his work on bifurcation problems.

Reference-contexts: Continuous extensions of Runge-Kutta formulas have also been applied to singular initial-value problems by Enright and Suhartanto [31] and Suhartanto [82], to boundary-value problems by Enright and Muir [28], to delay differential problems by Enright and Hayashi [18,19], Enright and Hu <ref> [22] </ref> and Hayashi [35], and to special classes of algebraic differential equations by Enright and MacDonald [26], MacDonald [65] and Nguyen [68].

Reference-contexts: DETEST was used in a later paper by Enright and Hull <ref> [23] </ref> where the results for twenty different solvers were presented. <p> We were criticized, especially by Fred Krogh and Larry Shampine, for modifying existing methods to make them conform to our requirement that they control error per unit step, rather than error per step. We believe that our defense in <ref> [23] </ref> was a reasonable one, but DETEST was eventually revised by Enright and Pryce in 1983 [29], and this new version did not require any modification of the programs being assessed.

Reference-contexts: Several authors had proposed partial remedies for these deficiencies, but none were completely satisfactory. Enright, Jackson, Ntrsett and Thomsen <ref> [24] </ref> developed a "bootstrapping" technique to associate with any s-stage, pth-order Runge-Kutta formula a "continuous extension" requiring s s stages. This scheme yields an approximation to the local solution that differs from the true local solution by at most O (h p ) or O (h p+1 ). <p> The general approach is developed in <ref> [24] </ref> and specific examples of methods of orders four, five and six are given there. Upper bounds on s s were also obtained for both O (h p ) and O (h p+1 ) extensions.

Reference-contexts: Classes of other continuous Runge-Kutta formulas were later investigated by Fine [33], Owren and Zennaro [69,70], Muir and Owren [66], and Verner [84]. Using such continuous extensions, an efficient scheme for detecting and stepping over discontinuities was developed and analyzed by Enright, Jackson, Ntrsett and Thomsen <ref> [25] </ref>. New step-size and error control strategies have also been introduced and analyzed by Enright [15,16] and Higham [39]; they are based on the idea of trying to ensure that the defect associated with the O (h p+1 ) continuous extension satisfies max kffi (x)k t on each step.

An implementation of an explicit Runge-Kutta code for initial-value ODE problems, known as TERK [32], based on these new results has been under development for some time, and is now nearing completion.

Reference-contexts: Some special Runge-Kutta formulas have been developed and implemented for boundary-value problems by Muir [67] and Enright and Muir <ref> [27] </ref>. Still others have been developed and implemented for first-order problems by Sharp [75], and second-order problems by Sharp [74] and Sharp and Fine [77,78] (but these last four do not involve continuous extensions). Investigations related to the assessment and comparison of numerical methods have continued.

In these new versions the emphasis was shifted to judging solvers based on how efficiently and effectively they can maintain a requirement that the global error be kept proportional to the tolerance.

Reference-contexts: The entire package is a better example of good "software engineering" than the original DETEST, and of course it is available to anyone who wishes to use it. A more readily available description of the package did not appear until 1987 <ref> [30] </ref>. The package was to be used heavily during the next period. 4 The 1983-early 1996 period A new theme, which has led to several new initiatives during this period, is the development of continuous methods.

Reference-contexts: It uses a collection of twenty-one test problems, and it stores the "true solution" as piecewise polynomials, obtained using high-precision arithmetic. Several aspects of parallelism have been considered during this period. The potential for parallelism in standard Runge-Kutta methods has been studied by Jackson and Ntrsett <ref> [59] </ref>: both negative and positive results are presented. Many of the negative results are based on a theorem that bounds the order of a Runge-Kutta formula in terms of the minimal polynomial associated with its coefficient matrix.

Reference-contexts: Stewart's final chapter considered error propagation further, showing a link with control theory, and also suggesting the possibility of automatically calculating an error bound along with an approximate solution. This idea was very much influenced by Kahan [63,64], and in turn led to Wayne Jackson's PhD thesis <ref> [62] </ref> on calculating ellipsoidal error bounds, rather than the rectangular parallelepipeds produced by interval arithmetic.
