Title: A Note on Scoring Clones Given a Probe Ordering  
Author: Mudita Jain Eugene W. Myers 
Date: December 28, 1995  
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for scoring clones given an ordering of probes under a schema proposed by Alizadeh et al. [1] in the context of physical mapping with unique probes. The algorithm runs in time linear in the number of blocks of ones in the underlying sparse incidence matrix. A sparse and efficient algorithm for this task is important as it appears to be a central task in most algorithms for physical mapping.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to correct D to the matrix that is most-likely to reflect the actual, perfect data.

However, in practice, the measured data contains errors in the form of false positives (i.e. a 1 where there should be a 0), false negatives (i.e. a 0 where there should be a 1), and chimeras (i.e. two distinct intervals reported as one).

Reference-contexts: Observe that our goal is to correct V to match the pattern (0 fl 1 fl ) k 0 fl with minimal cost. Without chimera costs, the problem is clearly just an instance of the approximate regular expression pattern matching problem solvable in O (mk) time <ref> [8] </ref>. Moreover, we claim without proof that the edit graph formalism developed in [8] can be modified to accommodate chimera costs.
