Abstract: Imprecise inference models the ability to infer sets of values or information chunks. Imprecise database inference is just as important as precise inference. In fact, it is more prevalent than its precise counterpart even in precise databases. Analyzing the extent of imprecise inference is important in knowledge discovery and database security. Imprecise inference analysis can be used to "mine" rule-based knowledge from database data. In database security, imprecise inference analysis can help determine whether or not a system is safe from imprecise inference attacks. This paper deals with the general problem of analyzing fuzzy inference based on functional dependencies (FDs) in database relations. Fuzzy inference, the ability to infer fuzzy set values, generalizes imprecise (set-valued) inference and precise inference. Likewise, fuzzy relational databases generalize their classical and imprecise counterparts by supporting fuzzy information storage and retrieval. Inference analysis is performed using a special abstract model which maintains vital links to classical, imprecise and fuzzy relational database models. These links increase the utility of the inference formalism in practical applications involving "catalytic inference analysis," including knowledge discovery and database security control.

Reference-contexts: However, for technical reasons precise information is expressed using singleton sets. Imprecise information is expressed using classical sets with cardinality greater than one. Definition: A fuzzy set X on domain D is defined by a characteristic function X (x) * <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all x * D. 2 A fuzzy set generalizes a classical set in that its characteristic function takes values in the interval [0; 1] rather than the set f0; 1g. <p> Definition: A fuzzy set X on domain D is defined by a characteristic function X (x) * <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all x * D. 2 A fuzzy set generalizes a classical set in that its characteristic function takes values in the interval [0; 1] rather than the set f0; 1g. The ability to model shades of membership or degrees of belonging provides a natural mechanism for expressing subjective and linguistic notions. For example, the term moderate in the "fuzzy" fact, "Salary is moderate," is suitably modeled as a fuzzy set. <p> Definition: The ff-level set or ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X ff , is the classical set fx j x ffg for any ff * <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The strong ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X + ff , is the classical set fx j x &gt; ffg for any ff * [0; 1]. <p> a fuzzy set X, denoted as X ff , is the classical set fx j x ffg for any ff * <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The strong ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X + ff , is the classical set fx j x &gt; ffg for any ff * [0; 1]. <p> Some fuzzy relational database models introduce an additional "tuple membership" attribute to express the degree of belonging of each tuple to the relation [16,24]. Tuple memberships usually are numeric values in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Since the main thrust of this work is to analyze fuzzy inference in precise databases augmented with fuzzy relations, tuple membership is considered to be a Boolean property.

The extension to the inference model to tuple membership values in [0; 1] or, more generally, fuzzy sets on [0; 1] is easily accomplished by treating tuple membership as a separate attribute. 3 Definition: A fuzzy tuple t = (t 1 ; t 2 ; :::; t n ) is defined with respect to a relation scheme R A = (A 1 <p> in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Deductive inference in a database can be generalized as "partial deduction" which occurs when values for a subset of left-hand side attributes are used to determine a right-hand side attribute value. The different forms of FD-based inference can be unified using the idea of an "induced context" <ref> [9] </ref>. For a relation with attributes X and Y , the induced context, I X!Y (C X ), is the finest context for Y that yields a fuzzy FD from X to Y with context C X for X. <p> Finally, the desired context C 2IE is induced using glb (C 1ID ; C 2D ) as shown in Figure 2. Not all inference channels in a database are linear as in the example above. Nevertheless, even complicated nonlinear inference channels can be reduced to multiple linear channels <ref> [9] </ref>. In general, the set of prevailing inference channels is determined by constructing a hypergraph of the existing FDs. The hypergraph can be converted to a regular graph, and channels identified using a standard path enumeration algorithm. The problem of inference channel detection has been shown to be NP-complete [9,20]. <p> R 1 (N ame, J ob) Bill Engr M ary Engr J ane Engr Bob Engr J im M ngr Beth M ngr R 2 (J ob, Exp, Salary) J ob Exp Salary Engr [0; 3) [35K; 45K] Engr [3; 6) [40K; 50K] Engr [6; 9) [45K; 65K] Engr <ref> [9; 12) [50K; 70K] </ref> M ngr [0; 3) [40K; 55K] M ngr [6; 9) [60K; 80K] The precise FD: N ame (C 1N ) !

J ob (C 1J ) in R 1 , the imprecise FD: N ame (C N ) ! <p> Consequently, in security applications it is necessary to examine the induced contexts and the actual inferred information. An inference compromise due to catalytic information definitely exists when the induced context in the catalytic case is finer than the corresponding context in the non-catalytic case (or when they are non-comparable <ref> [9] </ref>). A compromise potentially exists when the induced contexts are identical.

Reference-contexts: The precision of the inference, of course, depends on the quality of the induced FD. Induced FDs modeling abduction and partial deduction usually have coarser contexts and produce coarser inferences. Precise inference channels are composed of a "use set" of FDs <ref> [12] </ref>. Likewise, fuzzy inference channels are composed of a use set of fuzzy FDs and can be represented as chains of fuzzy FDs.

Reference-contexts: It is necessary to develop a common ground which bridges classical and fuzzy databases and which allows both kinds of databases to be employed simultaneously to the fullest extents possible <ref> [17] </ref>. The abstract relational database model described in this section provides the needed bridge. It is defined using fuzzy sets, which of course, generalize classical sets (imprecise values) and singleton sets (atomic values). 3.1 Domain Integrity The domain integrity property defines legal or "consistent" tuple component values.

Reference-contexts: An inference attack occurs when a user is able to infer sensitive information from authorized query responses and prevailing common knowledge. Integrity constraints, particularly functional dependencies (FDs) and multivalued dependencies (MVDs), pose serious security threats. Su and Oszoyoglu <ref> [20] </ref> have examined precise FD- and MVD-based inference in multilevel secure (MLS) databases. They showed that the detection and elimination of precise inference are NP-complete problems. They also devised an algorithm for optimally upgrading information to eliminate such compromises.

Reference-contexts: Legal values must be "meaningful" fuzzy sets. The term "meaningful" is defined with respect to partitions on database domains called "contexts." Contexts are constructed using similarity relations <ref> [21] </ref>, or more generally, equivalence relations. They control the precision of tuple components. A context C is a partition on a set ^ D generated by an equivalence relation on ^ D. ^ D is a subset of the underlying database domain D.
