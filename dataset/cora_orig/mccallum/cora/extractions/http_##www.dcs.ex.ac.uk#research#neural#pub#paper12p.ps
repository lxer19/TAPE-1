Title: Self-Organizing Sets of Experts  
Author: Niall Griffith and Derek Partridge 
Date: May 10, 1996  
Abstract: We describe and evaluate multi-network connectionist systems composed of "expert" networks. By preprocessing training data with a competitive learning network, the system automatically organizes the process of decomposition into expert subtasks. Using several different types of challenging problem, we assess this approach | the degree to which the automatically generated experts really are specialists on a predictable subset of the overall task, and a comparison of such decompositions with equivalent single-networks. In addition, we assess the utility of this approach alongside, and in competition to, non-expert multiversion systems. Previously developed measures of `diversity' for such systems are also applied to provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of specialization obtained in an expert-net ensemble. We show that on both types of problem, abstract well-defined and data-defined, the automatic decomposition does produce an effective set of specialist networks which together can support a high level of performance. Curiously, the study does not provide any support for a differential of effectiveness within the two classes of problem: continuous, homogeneous functions and discrete, discontinuous functions.
