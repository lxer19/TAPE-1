Abstract: A model based on coupled mechanisms for place recognition, path integration, and maintenance of head direction in rodents replicates a variety of neurophysiological and behavioral data. Here we consider a task described in [ Collett et al. 1986 ] in which gerbils were trained to find food equidistant from three identical landmarks arranged in an equilateral triangle. In probe trials with various manipulations of the landmark array, the model produces behaviors similar to those of the animals. We discuss computer simulations and an implementation of portions of the model on a mobile robot.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the animals are maintaining their position relative to the start by means of path integration. Direct neurophysiological evidence for a path integration system is lacking, but there is some evidence that lesion of the caudate nucleus impairs such tasks <ref> [ Abraham et al. 1983 ] </ref> . Other anatomical and physiological evidence has prompted Douglas [ 1989 ] to posit that striatum and/or parietal lobe are involved in updating an attention-related spatial vector by path integration.

Reference-contexts: We ran the robot in a 22fi23 foot irregularly-shaped maze whose walls were constructed from cardboard packing boxes. Ultrasonic range data was collected into an occupancy grid [ Moravec 1988 ] ; then standard edge detection and Hough transform algorithms <ref> [ Ballard & Brown 1982 ] </ref> were applied to detect concave and convex corners. These corners served as landmarks for the model. The robot performed the self-localization operation described earlier, reset its path integrator, and computed a vector from its present position to a predefined goal location.

Reference-contexts: Cells in various parts of the rat nervous system, including postsubiculum [ Taube et al. 1990a, Taube et al. 1990b ] and parietal cortex <ref> [ Chen 1991 ] </ref> , were found to be unimodally tuned to the animal's head direction. The preferred direction for such a cell (i.e., the direction eliciting maximal response) is constant throughout an environment.

Reference-contexts: Subtracting allocentric from egocentric bearings of all visible landmarks produces a set of estimates of the current head direction.

Reference-contexts: Introduction We have developed a model of rodent navigation based on tightly coupled mechanisms for place coding, path integration, and maintenance of head direction. Our theory reproduces a variety of behavioral and neurophysiological phenomena. 1 In this paper, we model behavioral data from <ref> [ Collett et al. 1986 ] </ref> in which gerbils find a food reward among local landmarks in an otherwise cue impoverished environment. First we review some data on the mechanisms of place coding, head direction, and path integration. <p> To our knowledge, no one has yet recorded from place cells of a disoriented rat while it is being reintroduced to a familiar environment. Discussion We have shown that when our model is applied to the manipulations of the equilateral triangle landmark arrangement described in <ref> [ Collett et al. 1986 ] </ref> , it produces behavior equivalent to vector voting. Yet it contains no mechanism for explicitly binding perceived to remembered landmarks, or for gathering votes from multiple independent vector computations.

Reference-contexts: But cells' preferred directions measured with respect to true north may differ across environments. HD cells maintain their activity in the dark, presumably by integrating vestibular cues, but the animal's directional sense will eventually drift if no external input is available <ref> [ McNaughton et al. 1991 ] </ref> . There is evidence that rats use visual landmarks to correct for cumulative integration errors. If visual cues rotate while the rat is in a familiar environment, preferred directions of HD cells rotate by a corresponding amount.

Reference-contexts: Experimental data from rodents Recordings from hippocampus have demonstrated that rats have an internal representation of place consisting of cells that fire when the animal is in a particular region of the environment (see <ref> [ Muller et al. 1991 ] </ref> for a review). The activity in these cells seems to be dependent on the arrangement of visual cues: a rotation in visual cues causes a corresponding rotation of place fields [ McNaughton et al. 1993a ] .
