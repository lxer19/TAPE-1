Abstract: Bitonic columns are an extension of the consecutive ones property for a matrix. For some optimization problems, if the constraint matrix has the proper bitonic column property then a fast algorithm can find an optimal solution. This paper shows how the PQ-tree reduction algorithm of Booth and Lueker can be extended into an efficient algorithm to test for a bitonic column property.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes an efficient method for testing whether a bitonic column property holds and finding a permutation that puts the matrix into a conforming configuration. 2 PQ-trees Booth and Lueker <ref> [1] </ref> showed how to test for the consecutive ones property (and related properties such as being an interval graph) in linear time with a data structure called a PQ-tree.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The relationship of interval graphs and consecutive ones is well known <ref> [2] </ref>. A graph is an interval graph if its adjacency matrix has the consecutive ones property (there exists a permutation of the rows in which all ones are consecutive in every column).

Reference-contexts: Consecutive ones matrices are a subclass of a broader group of (0; 1) integer program coefficient matrices that admit solution (when the requirements vector b = ~ 1) by a greedy algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. A bitonic column property is a generalization of the consecutive ones property. Definition 1: Bitonic Columns.

Reference-contexts: For some combinatoric problems, such a configuration enables solution by a fast algorithm that relies on the fact that optimal sub-solutions can be discovered through relatively local search. A nearly linear solution to the NP-complete problem of minimax programs is given in Hu and Tucker <ref> [4] </ref> for problems whose constraint array has the mountain property.
