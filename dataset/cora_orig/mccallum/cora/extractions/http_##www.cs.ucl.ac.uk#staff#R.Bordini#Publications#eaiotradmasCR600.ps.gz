Abstract: The paper presents an approach to the description of ontologies used in Multi-Agent Systems as a means to allow interoperability of such systems. It is inspired by a pragmatic theory of intensionality worked out as part of an anthropological approach to agent migration. A new formalisation of how an intensional ontology can be ascribed to a society of agents is presented, together with a first formalisation of the recovery of taxonomical relations from such ontologies. This process of discovering taxonomies is inspired by ethnographic studies in social anthropology. The formalisations are developed using a framework for agent theories, based on the Z specification language. Further, the approach is illustrated by the ascription of an ontology and associated taxonomies for an exotic application: the game of cricket. Finally, several issues related to this approach are discussed.

One of them, which is based on the idea that choosing key informants is of fundamental importance in ethnographic work, is to incorporate in societies of agents the idea of informant agent (IA).

Reference-contexts: Such formal descriptions must include various aspects of a society (see Bordini and Campbell 1995). In <ref> (Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1997) </ref> we have explained how an agent can ascribe ontological descriptions for the terms used in the communication language to a society being observed; this idea was first mentioned in (Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1996). <p> The sections that follow contain discussions and an overview of our anthropological approach. 2 Review of Ascription of Intensional Ontologies In this section we review the most important concepts and definitions that we have presented in more detail in <ref> (Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1997) </ref>. They are essential for an understanding of the specifications we shall present in Section 4. <p> The way anthropologists elaborate their taxonomical descriptions (see Section 3) has led us to realise that we can (as we show in Section 4.3) recover taxonomical relations in intensional ontologies that our anthropologist agents have ascribed, using the approach in <ref> (Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1997) </ref>, to particular societies of agents. We have also shown that research methods in anthropology (Bernard 1994) can provide useful techniques for an agent's adaptation to a strange society. <p> We have given a larger account of these concepts and some discussion of its advantages in <ref> (Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1997) </ref>; for further details it is necessary to refer to (Vieira and da Rocha Costa 1993). These concepts will be made clearer when we use them in the formalisation presented in Section 4. <p> We expect to present further extensions, to deal with related problems, in future papers. Acknowledgements We acknowledge some nice suggestions from various participants in the CIA97 meeting <ref> (see Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1997) </ref> and the comments made by Mark d'Inverno and Michael Luck on an earlier version of that paper. Michael Luck also helped with the Appendix on the elements of Z and other remarks on its advantages.

Reference-contexts: Evidently, Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) techniques can be used for studies in anthropology (as indeed for all social science)|see, e.g., (Doran et al. 1994; Doran and Palmer 1995), which use artificial societies to study the emergence and perpetuation of hierarchical societies. In <ref> (Bordini 1998) </ref> we aim at showing that the converse also holds: anthropology can provide the basis for resolving open research issues in DAI. <p> Being a necessary cross-cultural link, we expect them to reduce the need for standards in MAS to promote interoperability, which is the usual approach; we however argue that it is not sufficient in the particular context of societies of cognitive autonomous agents <ref> (Bordini 1998) </ref>. <p> We suggest that it should be among the disciplines of interest to MAS if promoting interop-eration of disparate agencies is to grow into a substantial MAS topic. This is the underlying thesis in <ref> (Bordini 1998) </ref>. Yet another field of social sciences which has been neglected so far with respect to DAI, despite being of relevance to the area, as the most recent part of this work demonstrates, is ethnography of communication, mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: Our research method, the reader cannot have failed to observe, is basically one of providing formal specifications rather than "informative experimentation," which is more usual in research on artificial societies. On the same lines as <ref> (Conte and Castelfranchi 1995) </ref>, formal here means that we deal with abstract aspects of the subject studied; further, it means "explicit, consistent, controllable and unequivocal (or almost unequivocal) ways of expressing thoughts." Although formal methods for the presentation of research ideas are well accepted in artificial intelligence, some still seem to <p> Further, on other general advantages of Z itself, they mention its sufficient expressiveness, suitability for moving from specifications to implementation of computational prototypes, the availability of supporting books and tools, etc. Concluding the argument on our research method, as for <ref> (Conte and Castelfranchi 1995) </ref> the main purpose of our specification is in respect of rigorous presentation of ideas. Also, because of the use of the Z framework, we were able to provide a computational model, which is important in the context we are working on, namely MAS. <p> The advantage of this approach as opposed to the usual approach to interoperability is twofold, for the kind of MAS that is founded on complex aspects of social and cognitive sciences <ref> (Conte and Castelfranchi 1995) </ref>. Providing agents that can learn to interact with different communities not only allows interoperation of disparate MAS without the need for standardisation on models and languages of agents, but also brings to light several issues of interest in the disciplines that form the foundations of MAS.

Reference-contexts: Doran's work also recognises the importance of emotional aspects of agents in explaining certain social phenomena <ref> (Doran 1997) </ref>. This is connected to other work related to our general project|see (Bazzan, Bordini, and Campbell 1999; 1997)|which argues in favour of an "emotional stance" in MAS. It is inspired by ideas on Moral Sentiments by Ridley (1996), who also argues that emotions are "universally recognisable".

Reference-contexts: A complete definition of that relation would need to refer to particular informant agents' mental states and their architectures (and this is of course not desirable in a project aiming at interoperability). For example, if the informant agent works as a theorem prover <ref> (Fisher 1995) </ref>, accepting a sentence means simply trying to prove it, and accepting it if it is a theorem in the present set of beliefs of the agent.

Reference-contexts: It relies heavily on the ideas presented in <ref> (Frake 1969) </ref>, which have allowed us to see that our previous approach to ontologies contained the necessary means to augment ascribed ontologies of terms with the description of the taxonomical relations among those terms. <p> This leads to the discernment of how they interpret their world of experience from the way they talk about it, therefore moulding the "analysis of terminological systems in a way which reveals the conceptual principles that generate them." <ref> (Frake 1969) </ref>. Frake goes on to say that different peoples see "things" differently, and mentions that in the past anthropologists sometimes believed this to indicate deficient abstractive ability in primitive societies. <p> Knowing how those Indians group objects and which attributes they select as dimensions to generate their taxonomies helps in the construction of a sketch map of the world in the view of the tribe <ref> (Frake 1969) </ref>. Accordingly, we find that some treatment of taxonomical relations must occur in computational societies if one is trying to facilitate migration of agents. <p> The diagram of the sub-partitioning of the segregate `something to eat', as revealed by the naming responses to the four objects above, is in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: In order to define subjective quasi-intensions and related notions, the acceptance relation between agents and expressions is introduced. The definition, originally described in <ref> (Martin 1959) </ref>, follows. Definition 1 (Acceptance Relation). Acceptance is an empirical relation between users and sentences of a language, observed by an experimenter who asks questions by means of a set of sentences forming a logical theory.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea is that certain individual agents should be able to interact in societies of agents which were designed using paradigms or theories of agents different from their own, or which had different histories of autonomous evolution. We have proposed the use of Cognitive Anthropology <ref> (Tyler 1969) </ref> as a theoretical foundation and we suggest that fieldwork practice in social anthropology (Bernard 1994) can provide useful techniques for an agent's adaptation to a strange society. <p> agent migration based on social anthropology, from the underlying pragmatical theory of intensionality (Vieira and da Rocha Costa 1993), or whether they are specific to our work on ascription of intensional ontologies. 2.1 Anthropologically-Based Migration of Agents We have proposed in (Bordini and Campbell 1995) the use of Cognitive Anthropology <ref> (Tyler 1969) </ref> as a theoretical foundation for the search for inspirations to the treatment of the problems associated with cultural adaptation of agents. <p> In brief, the intention of the cognitive approach to social anthropology is to discover the "organizing principles underlying behaviour" in unexplored societies|i.e., "how different peoples organize and use their cultures" <ref> (Tyler 1969) </ref>|and to rely on fairly formal methods for specifying theories for each particular culture. That is why cognitive anthropologists have been very concerned 2 with describing arrangements (of which taxonomy is one particular type) for the cultures they study.

Reference-contexts: They are essential for an understanding of the specifications we shall present in Section 4. This section is organised according to whether the definitions are from our work on agent migration based on social anthropology, from the underlying pragmatical theory of intensionality <ref> (Vieira and da Rocha Costa 1993) </ref>, or whether they are specific to our work on ascription of intensional ontologies. 2.1 Anthropologically-Based Migration of Agents We have proposed in (Bordini and Campbell 1995) the use of Cognitive Anthropology (Tyler 1969) as a theoretical foundation for the search for inspirations to the treatment <p> We have given a larger account of these concepts and some discussion of its advantages in (Bordini, Campbell, and Vieira 1997); for further details it is necessary to refer to <ref> (Vieira and da Rocha Costa 1993) </ref>. These concepts will be made clearer when we use them in the formalisation presented in Section 4. The intension of an expression is what is known about it in order to identify the object/entity to which it refers. <p> We consider here only sentences of this sort; the consistent acceptance of sentences including the logical connectives by communicating agents within the quasi-intensional approach is given in <ref> (Vieira and da Rocha Costa 1993) </ref>. 9 Note that Term (and Pred , mentioned next) are infinite domains; particular target societies will specify the subset of terms (and predicates) they use, as we shall see later. 10 We now present the definition of an InformantAgent , which is built on the
