Title: A Parallel Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Finding Steiner Minimal Trees  
Author: Steven A. Spoon 
Date: May 1996  
Abstract: This paper focuses on the final step of a method studied by Harris at Clemson University for finding the Steiner Minimal Tree of a given set of points. Specifically, the problem this paper faces is as follows: Given a set of points, a set of trees over those points, and a precomputed "compatibility" matrix relating those trees, find the set of trees which forms the minimum cost spanning tree for the graph. The matrix limits what solutions are possible, marking certain pairs of subtrees to be "incompatible." This paper studies the use of parallel exhaustive search techniques to solve this problem. First, this paper describes a sequential algorithm which uses an exhaustive depth-first search. The algorithm is implemented and timed. Second, this paper describes parallel depth-first algorithm. The parallel algorithm distributes portions of the exhaustive search space to worker nodes on a first-come, first-serve basis; the worker nodes then independently use a depth-first search on each of those individual portions, one worker node per portion. This algorithm, too, is implemented and is timed for a variety of input parameters. Overall, for reasonable choices of parameters, the parallel algorithm achieves good speedup.
