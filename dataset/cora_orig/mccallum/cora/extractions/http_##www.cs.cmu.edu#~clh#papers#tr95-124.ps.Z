Abstract: This report is a revision of an internal report written and distributed within the CMU community by Carol L. Hoover in August, 1994. Abstract MSE students who aspire to obtain business management positions within a computer-related technology company, to specialize in the development of software to support production and operations, and/or to start their own technical companies will need fundamental business skills and expertise. The MSE Program offers the Business Specialization Track to help students acquire appropriate business skills while completing their masters degree in software engineering. The track is exible in that it allows students to choose their own set of track courses from a list of approved business-related courses and, therefore, to match their career objectives with suitable courses. For instance, students can select courses to help them prepare for careers as executive-level managers of computer technology companies, as designers of information systems, as developers of software systems to support production and operations, and/or as founders of high technology companies. This report describes the track rationale and requirements, provides educational guidelines to help students select courses, lists the approved courses, and presents brief synopses of the approved courses. The report is based on the authors work in developing specialization tracks for the MSE program. The author started this work during the spring of 1993.
