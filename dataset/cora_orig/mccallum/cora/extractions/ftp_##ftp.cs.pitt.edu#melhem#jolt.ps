Abstract: This paper presents a partitioned optical passive star (POPS) interconnection topology and a control methodology that, together, provide the high throughput and low latency required for tightly coupled multiprocessor interconnection applications. The POPS topology has constant and symmetric optical coupler fanout and only one coupler between any two nodes of the network. Distributed control is based on the state sequence routing paradigm which multiplexes the network between a small set of control states and defines control operations to be transformations of those states. These networks have highly scalable characteristics for optical power budget, resource count, and message latency. Optical power is uniformly distributed and the size of the system is not directly limited by the power budget. Resource complexity grows as O(n) for the couplers, O(nn) for transceivers, and O(n log(n)) for control. We present analysis and simulation studies which demonstrate the ability of a POPS network to support large scale parallel processing, (1024 nodes) using current device and cou pler technology.

Using multiple passive stars, it is possible to design completely reconfigurable networks without the use of active photonic switches [GLZ91]. Historically, network configurations using passive star components have been implemented using one of three multiplexing technologies [Muk92]: wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), time division multiplexing 1.

Reference-contexts: This technology is currently capable of wavelength separations on the order of 1 nm yielding a total on the order of 100 slots given a typical fiber transmission window with constraints on the total power of all wavelengths <ref> [Bra90] </ref>. In addition, it is necessary to use rapidly tunable laser sources, rapidly tunable filter receivers, or both, to obtain sufficient interconnectivity and throughput. Only if both tunable receivers and tunable transmitters are used is it possible to use a number of wavelengths less than the number of interconnected nodes.

Reference-contexts: In many implementations, throughput may be sacrificed in favor of simple control. Other designs have implemented adaptive scheduling to increase channel utilization and improve performance <ref> [CL91] </ref>. In considering the combined issues of topology and control, our investigation has specifically focused on the application of optical technology which can be implemented currently or in the near term. Therefore, our designs are driven by three constraints.

Reference-contexts: For example, using a coupler fanout of 64, a 1024 node system would have 16 groups, 16 transmitter and receiver channels per node and 256 couplers. Further, if one were to adopt integrated optical [OOOK92] or free space coupling <ref> [Hin89] </ref> in lieu of fused fiber, even higher fanouts and larger scale systems would be possible. The free space domain has a very interesting potential for two reasons. First, as optical bandwidths continue to increase more rapidly than the data bandwidth of each processor, high fanout coupling is more desirable.

Reference-contexts: The essential point is that the control unit needs only to respond to the changes in the traffic and is not required to respond to individual messages. Since communication patterns in a multiprocessor environment tend to exhibit locality characteristics <ref> [Joh92] </ref>, the rate at which changes occur in the traffic is significantly lower than the message generation rate. Thus, we can decouple the control bandwidth from the throughput of the network. There are several methods of implementing dynamic sequence transformation.

Reference-contexts: However, the literature on operating systems contains numerous algorithms of varying complexity for selecting a candidate for replacement <ref> [SPG91] </ref>. As discussed below a central focus of our research is the evaluation of various replacement algorithms to state sequence routing. Although the replacement algorithm is important for reducing both the number of faults, and fault service time, message latency is also tied to the choice of sequence length. <p> The network capacity, in messages per tick, is simply the number of couplers, n is the number of nodes, and bi is the burst interval. Sequence faults cause path preemptions in the sequence according to a not used recently (NUR) replacement algorithm <ref> [SPG91] </ref>. In this algorithm, each entry in the state sequence is marked as used or unused based on whether a message was actually transmitted when the path was most recently available. Each controller monitors this information for paths originating in its group using the phase two sequence information.

Reference-contexts: If no such path exists in the current mapping, the node must wait. In the extreme, a state sequence 7 can be devised to implement all of the n 2 paths in a completely connected network <ref> [Tho91] </ref>. In this case, state sequence routing is identical to time multiplexing. Unfortunately, the latencies inherent in a fully time multiplexed implementation, as well as for most other static embeddings, is prohibitive.
