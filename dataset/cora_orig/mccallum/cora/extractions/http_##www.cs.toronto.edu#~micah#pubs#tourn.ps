Reference-contexts: In particular, searching with erroneous comparisons was initiated by Rivest, Meyer, Kleitman, Winklmann and Spencer [RMKWS], assuming that the number of errors is less than e. Pelc [P] studied that problem in the probabilistic model (with fixed error probability p). Pelc [P], and Aslam and Dhagat <ref> [AD] </ref> worked on the model of "linearly bounded errors", where they assume that there is a constant r such that each initial sequence of i comparison questions receives at most ri erroneous answers. 3 A Lower Bound for T DISC;K Let LB = i=1 * 2 lg (1+ lg (n) )

Reference-contexts: to be the first to give a lower bound on the number of rounds required to select the best player with probability 1 in the strong transitivity model, and the first to consider the adversary and discriminating models at all (although special cases of the discriminating model are studied in <ref> [Br] </ref> and [Th]). Coping with unreliable information has also been studied in other contexts. In particular, searching with erroneous comparisons was initiated by Rivest, Meyer, Kleitman, Winklmann and Spencer [RMKWS], assuming that the number of errors is less than e. <p> That is, the weader the common opponent k, the greater the significance of a loss to Player k in distinguishing between Player i and Player j. We mention two commonly used models that lead to discriminating matrices. The Bradley-Terry Model <ref> [Br] </ref> Player i has a strength i , where 1 2 n , and p ij = i i + j . This model applies when each player is a Geiger counter and, in any game, the first counter to click wins.

Reference-contexts: These bounds are optimal up to constant factors. Previous work on the strong transitivity model has focused on classical "knockout tournaments", where a player is eliminated as soon as he or she loses a game, and a total of (n 1) games are played ([ChuH], [Hw], [I], <ref> [CheH] </ref>). The tournament can be represented as a tree, each leaf containing a player and each internal node containing the winner of a game between its two children.

Reference-contexts: Our goal for the coin is to determine the correct answer as quickly as possible with probability 1 . This problem was first addressed in <ref> [Fa] </ref> where Far-rell proved that limsup *!0 * 2 1 (Expected Number of flips) c; where c is a constant. Our algorithm works by guessing different values for the bias of the coin. In stage i, the guess is that the bias is * i = 1 2 i .

Reference-contexts: They show that (e + 1)n1 comparisons are necessary and sufficient to find the best player. In <ref> [FPRU] </ref>, Feige, Peleg, Raghavan and Upfal choose a probabilistic model, assuming that each comparison has a fixed probability p of being erroneous, and that successive comparisons are independent. The goal is then to select the best player with probability at least 1 , for some fixed confidence level .
