Reference-contexts: Starting with the last section and working upstream, SmartCap calculates the space made available by vehicles from the previous section, how many vehicles from the previous section may move into the current section, and then the velocity in the previous section. For more details on the SmartCap model, see <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. <p> The entry plan is quite similar, also using a greedy policy to calculate the number of vehicles which may be allowed to enter the highway at a given time. For more details on the velocity and entry plans, the interested reader is referred to <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.2 Individual Vehicle Activity Plan For an individual vehicle AHS design on a one-lane highway, the activity plan is straightforward. In its entry section, each vehicle should perform a lcleft to move from the entry lane into the main traffic lane.

Reference-contexts: This concept is designated IVRRA, for Individual Vehicle, Range, Rate and Acceleration information. 1.2.2 Platooning It has been suggested (see <ref> [3] </ref>) that great throughput benefits can be achieved by having groups of cars (called platoons) drive extremely close together (with only one or two metres between vehicles). In order to do so safely, we must have constant communication between vehicles, including information about the platoon's lead vehicle's acceleration.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the design requires that only free agents (single car platoons) can change lanes. It has recently been suggested that relaxing this requirement may lead to an increase in both safety and throughput <ref> [4] </ref>. The proposed design would allow cars to change lanes onto the end of a platoon, rather than changing lanes as free agents, and then performing a join manuvre. <p> Since we also want the throughput to be high, we will require that vehicles leave the minimum safe distance between themselves and the vehicle ahead. To find the minimum safe spacing, we use the game-theoretic approach of Lygeros, Godbole and Sastry <ref> [4] </ref>, [5]. In this approach, we assume that the driver of the vehicle in front of us is doing everything he can in order to try to crash into us. <p> However, since we are averaging over a simulation time step (at least 10 s), any small variations will be cancelled out. It has recently been suggested that, with a little more communication, these numbers could be significantly decreased (see <ref> [4] </ref>). If each vehicle class is divided into ten categories with more limited ranges of accelerations, even assuming worst case pairings within each category will give 10 significantly lower values for minimum spacing.

Reference-contexts: We must therefore calculate how much spacetime is required for these manuvres in each lane. While the vehicle is in the process of changing lanes to the exit lane, we follow Puri <ref> [6] </ref> and consider it to be taking up space in both lanesthe through lane and the exit lane.

Reference-contexts: Blending of these curves to get smooth transitions is also discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>, but we ignore those effects, since they are likely to be insignificant given our level of accuracy.
