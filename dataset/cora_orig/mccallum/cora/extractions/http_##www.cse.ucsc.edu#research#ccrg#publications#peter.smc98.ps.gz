Abstract: Group collaboration in distributed multimedia environments extends gradually to larger groups and wide-area networks. While reliable multicasting has made significant advancements in recent years, effective mechanisms to synchronize and coordinate work within large multicast groups and across long distances are still lacking. Group coordination is here understood as the mediated access to shared remote resources in synchronous group-work, as for example in telecollaboration and distributed simulation environments, complementing protocols for group membership, media synchronization and reliable ordered multicast. A comparative analytic model for known classes of group coordination mechanisms, ranging from socially mediated control to floor control in ring and tree topologies, is presented. It is shown that hierarchical group coordination is the most efficient and scalable approach to date. Based on these findings, a novel protocol is described, which dynamically organizes participants in a multilevel control tree and aggregates resource sharing directives on the paths between interacting stations.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Increasing deployment of IP-multicast <ref> [6] </ref> has brought a new generation of collaborative multimedia applications to mainstream computing. While previous collaboration tools were proprietary, monolithic, and designed for small-scale collaboration in local area networks, newer applications are geared towards larger sessions with wide geographic range.

For a more detailed description and proof of correctness for HGCP we refer to [7]. Our goal is to exploit the best-effort delivery mechanism of IP multicast in a scalable and efficient tree protocol for reliable group coordination. The protocol consists of two stages: (1) control tree construction, and (2) control message dissemination.

Reference-contexts: A successful turn is X s = fl 0 + ffi + t . Finally, the expected idle time is I = + 1 . Substituting into Eq. 1, we obtain Eq. 3. 2 Activity Sensing (ICAS) is a special class of floor control proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>, where shared activities on resources are monitored by a background process at the session layer, in order to sense which site currently operates on the resource. This mechanism is comparable to collision sensing in medium access control.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes the operation of the Hierarchical Group Coordination Protocol (HGCP), a novel approach for floor control in shared propagation trees. Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 RELATED WORK Coordination problems such as initiation conflicts and resource competition in multimedia conferencing have been reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. Early efforts on coordination of group activities led to the conception of floor control for networked databases and telecol-laboration systems [20]. Various precursors of collaborative applications [2, 5, 21, 23] contained some form of proprietary floor control for small sessions with broadcast of control information and centralized coordination. <p> Such a scenario can occur for Internet collaboration, with an assumed latency that has been observed to be the minimum for acceptable audio conferencing quality <ref> [9] </ref>. We can see that a generic tree-based floor-control protocol exhibits superior stability and scalability with regard to higher loads. With an aggregated control scheme, floor control remains effective despite a large number of directives being exchanged among participants.

Reference-contexts: The protocol consists of two stages: (1) control tree construction, and (2) control message dissemination. In order to consistently account for floor control messaging, we assume ordered message delivery between hosts. Ordering in multicast trees has been tackled for example by Jia <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Support for implicit labeling and routing at the multicast router level has been proposed by Levine and Garcia-Luna in <ref> [11] </ref>. A sample scenario is shown in Figure 11. In this scenario, a ternary control tree is labeled from alphabet f0; 1; 2g, with F H = d located at l (d) = 110.

ACM Multimedia, </booktitle> <address> Boston, MA, </address> <month> Nov. </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: While various tree-based reliable multicast protocols have been proposed for highly scalable conferencing <ref> [12, 14, 24] </ref>, no group coordination mechanism or applications have been developed yet. The goal for such a protocol is to keep the tree depth minimal, in order to keep the number of hops for control transmissions low. <p> Each of these nodes can contend for any floor at any time and become FH. In a multicast collaboration session with multiple floors and floor holders, it is not practical to manage separate control trees, one per floor. Similar to the concurrent reliable multicast scheme proposed in <ref> [12] </ref>, we hence assume a single shared control tree with a branching factor B, which can be re-hung as a control tree with any other node as the root and FH, while preserving the property that all nodes have B children. <p> Ideally, the control tree correlates closely to the multicast routing tree, as built by multicast routing protocols such as DVMRP, CBT, or PIM [16]. We focus on an approach comparable to receiver-initiated mul-ticast <ref> [12] </ref>, which lets contending stations in the group-coordinated session maintain state information about a particular floor. Floor state information can hence be passed along between contending stations, without requiring the controller station to contact each station. For this purpose, each station maintains two timers. <p> If multiple FH are allowed in parallel for a particular resource, it is necessary to separate the FC and FH roles. A construction method for a control tree for group coordination on top of a multicast routing tree is outlined in <ref> [12] </ref>. A node x in the resulting hierarchical acknowledgment tree, whose edges are directed from children to their parents, is labeled with a unique label l (x), which is the prefix of all children of x. <p> Note that labels in the tree remain constant for the lifetime of the session, except in cases when nodes fail or new nodes join a subtree. Rare cases when relabeling is necessary are discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Adding a node in the tree involves only the new node as a child and its parent, while deletions require relabeling of the subtree of the deleted node.

Reference-contexts: Under this assumption, each of the dis cussed protocols must on the average traverse the same number of hosts on the path from the sender to a group of receivers. 2 Results Traces from MBone sessions <ref> [13] </ref>, sampled over a period of several hundred hours, indicate a group size ranging from 150 to over 550 participants.

[3] suggest to intertwine floor control with a rate-adaptation mechanism, which throttles media stream transmission according to the interest or capabilities of a heterogeneous receiver set. <p> A special case of ECTB is a star-topology, which is a tree of depth one with a root and n 1 descendants. The moderator-driven question board <ref> [15] </ref> exemplifies this scheme. Such a centralized scheme suffers as a communication bottleneck primarily from overload when the request rate increases. In our analysis, focused on multicast support for turn-taking, we did not account for this additional individual host processing cost.
