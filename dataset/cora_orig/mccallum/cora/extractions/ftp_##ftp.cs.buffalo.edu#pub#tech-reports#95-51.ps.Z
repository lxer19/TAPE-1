Abstract: We study the class coNPMV of complements of NPMV functions. Though defined symmetrically to NPMV this class exhibits very different properties. We clarify the complexity of coNPMV by showing that, surprisingly, it is essentially the same as that of NPMV NP . Complete functions for coNPMV are exhibited and central complexity-theoretic properties of this class are studied. We show that computing maximum satisfying assignments can be done in coNPMV, which leads us to a comparison of NPMV and coNPMV with Krentel's classes Max P and Min P. The difference hierarchy for NPMV is related to the query hierarchy for coNPMV. Finally, we examine a functional analogue of Chang and Kadin's relationship between a collapse of the Boolean hierarchy over NP and a collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: If a function f is total, it will always be explicitly noted.) The following classes of partial functions were first defined by Book, Long, and Selman <ref> [BLS84] </ref>. * NPMV is the set of all partial, multivalued functions computed by nondeterministic polyno mial time-bounded transducers; * NPSV is the set of all f 2 NPMV that are single-valued; * FP is the set of all partial functions computed by deterministic polynomial time-bounded transducers.

Relationships Between the Collapse of the Functional Difference and Poly- nomial Time Hierarchies Chang and Kadin <ref> [CK90] </ref> showed that if the Boolean hierarchy over NP collapses to the k th level, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the k th level of the Boolean hierarchy over NP NP .

Reference-contexts: For one example of this phenomena, we prove here that coNPMV is not included in FP NPMV unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. (This is an extension of a result of Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref>.) Yet, it is obvious that coNPMV can be computed in polynomial time with one query to coNPMV. Thus, a coNPMV oracle provides more information than an NPMV oracle. This is surprising, for function oracles, just as set oracles, provide knowledge about both their domains and their co-domains. <p> In addition, we prove that coNPMV NPMV (2) NPMV (k) NPMV (n O (1) ) NPMV NP ; where NPMV (k) is the k-th level of the difference hierarchy for NPMV as defined by Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref>. The difference hierarchy over NPMV does not collapse unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. This is striking. Even though the complexity of coNPMV is essentially the same as that of NPMV NP , there is an infinite hierarchy of complexity classes between them. <p> A function f belongs to NPMV if and only if it is polynomially length-bounded and graph (f ) belongs to NP. The domain of every function in NPMV belongs to NP. Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> define the difference hierarchy over NPMV as follows. Let F be a class of partial multivalued functions. A partial multivalued function f is in coF if there exist g 2 F and a polynomial p such that for every x, * set-f (x) = p (jxj) set-g (x). <p> If g is a single-valued partial function and M is a deterministic oracle transducer as just described, then we let M [g] denote the single-valued partial function computed by M with oracle g. 2.1 Definition. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> Let f and g be multivalued partial functions. f is Turing reducible to g in polynomial time, f P T g, if for some deterministic oracle transducer M , for every single-valued refinement g 0 of g, M [g 0 ] is a single-valued refinement of f . <p> If it were, since sat 2 coNPMV and sat is complete for NPMV, we would get that NPMV c coNPMV. But this seems to be very unlikely as the following extension of a result of Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> shows. 3.5 Theorem. NPMV coNPMV () NPMV c coNPMV () NP = coNP. Proof. We cycle through the implications. The first implication is trivial. For the second, let L 2 NP. <p> Hence we can have the situation that a function that is complete for some class, like sat for NPMV, is in coNPMV without the corresponding class being contained in coNPMV. This seems to happen again for maxsat. Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> show that maxsat 2 NPMV (2). In fact, it is even in coNPMV. However, we will show in the next section that the corresponding classes, namely MaxP or FP NP are unlikely to be contained in coNPMV. 3.7 Theorem. maxsat 2 coNPMV. Proof. <p> Observe by contrast that FP NPMV = FP NP = FP Min P = FP Max P , so coNPMV and NPMV define different -levels of the functional PH. Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> have shown that NPMV (2) FP NPMV () p p 2 Note that in contrast for the corresponding language classes we have NP (k) FP NP for all k. We can now improve the result of Fenner et al. 4.4 Corollary. coNPMV FP NPMV () p p Proof. <p> If p p 2 , then coNPMV FP coNPMV = FP NPMV NP = FP p 2 = FP NP = FP NPMV ; where the last equality is Theorem 1 in the paper by Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> and the second follows from the relativized version of the same theorem. Conversely, if coNPMV FP NPMV , then dom (coNPMV) P NP = p 2 , so that p p Now we will compare the query hierarchy for coNPMV with the difference hierarchy for NPMV. <p> We start with the following: 4.5 Theorem. coNPMV NPMV (2) NPMV (k) NPMV (n O (1) ) NPMV NP . All of the inclusions are strict unless the polynomial time hierarchy collapses. Proof. Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> showed that f 2 NPMV (k) if and only if f 's graph is in NP (k), and f 2 coNPMV if and only if f 's graph is in coNP. <p> But then p p p 2 . For the other inclusions, suppose FP coNPMV [k] = FP coNPMV [k+1] . Then FP NPMV NP [k] = FP NPMV NP [k+1] . By a theorem of Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref>, this implies that FP p 2 [k] = FP p 2 [k+1] , which, by a relativization of Kadin's theorem [Kad88], implies that the polynomial hierarchy collapses. 2 Thus we see, combining Theorems 4.5 and 4.6, that all classes of the difference hierarchy over NPMV are included in the query <p> There are (under reasonable assumptions) no inclusions in the opposite direction. Concerning the relationship between the query hierarchy over NPMV and the difference hierarchy over NPMV, we know from Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> that all classes of the first hierarchy are included in certain classes of the second hierarchy. Any inclusion in the opposite direction implies coNPMV FP NPMV , which again implies a collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy, by Corollary 4.4. <p> This implies MaxP NPMV, and since the hypothesis also implies NPMV = coNPMV, that MaxP coNPMV. 2 The previous two results relativize. Thus it is easy to see that analogous results hold for higher levels of the NPMV hierarchy and Krentel's min/max hierarchy <ref> [FHOS93, VW95] </ref>. 9 5. <p> Proof. In the case of NP, the Boolean and difference hierarchies are the same. Thus, Chang and Kadin's theorem states that if NP (k + 1) = NP (k), then PH = NP NP (k). Now we use two results of Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> By Theorem 13 of their paper, the difference hierarchies over NPMV and NP are directly coupled: NPMV (k + 1) = NPMV (k) if and only if NP (k + 1) = NP (k). Note that the proof of the latter relativizes.

Reference-contexts: Suppose coNPMV = NPMV (2). Take a set A 2 NP (2). Interpret A as a graph of a function f 2 NPMV (2). By assumption, f 2 coNPMV, thus A 2 coNP. Thus, we have NP (2) coNP, which implies the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy <ref> [Kad88] </ref>. The proofs for the other inclusions are completely analogous. 2 8 Theorem 4.5 is striking. Even though coNPMV is "very close" to NPMV NP , there is an infinite hierarchy of complexity classes between them. 4.6 Theorem. <p> Then FP NPMV NP [k] = FP NPMV NP [k+1] . By a theorem of Fenner et al. [FHOS93], this implies that FP p 2 [k] = FP p 2 [k+1] , which, by a relativization of Kadin's theorem <ref> [Kad88] </ref>, implies that the polynomial hierarchy collapses. 2 Thus we see, combining Theorems 4.5 and 4.6, that all classes of the difference hierarchy over NPMV are included in the query hierarchy over coNPMV, in fact already in its first level.

Reference-contexts: This is surprising, for function oracles, just as set oracles, provide knowledge about both their domains and their co-domains. We will define many-one reductions between multivalued functions, (This will be a straightforward adaptation of the many-one metric reducibility of Krentel <ref> [Kre88] </ref>.) and we will consider many-one complete functions for NPMV and coNPMV. <p> In particular, these definition templates define such classes of multivalued partial functions as FP NPMV , and NPMV NPMV . We will use the following generalization of the many-one metric reducibility of Krentel <ref> [Kre88] </ref> in order to discuss complete functions for classes of multivalued functions. 2.2 Definition. <p> Obviously, f P m g implies f P T g. The classes that we have been considering relate in interesting ways to studies of the complexity of optimization problems. In order to capture the complexity of optimization problems Krentel <ref> [Kre88] </ref> defined the complexity classes MaxP and MinP to contain the functions computable by taking the maximum, minimum, respectively, over sets of feasible solutions of problems in NP. Further, Krentel extended these classes to hierarchies of classes of optimization functions [Kre92].

Reference-contexts: Further, Krentel extended these classes to hierarchies of classes of optimization functions <ref> [Kre92] </ref>. These functions are best understood using Krentel's notion of metric Turing machine, which we now recall.

Reference-contexts: The more interesting question is whether these inclusions are strict. This is quite unlikely. 4.7 Theorem. Max P NPMV if and only if Min P NPMV if and only if NP = coNP. Proof. If NP = coNP, then NPMV = F p 2 <ref> [Sel94] </ref>, thus especially NPMV = Max P = Min P. Now suppose Max P NPMV (the case for Min P is analogous). Let A be any set from 2 = P NP .

Vollmer and Wagner <ref> [VW93, VW95] </ref> gave a detailed structural examination of Krentel's hierarchy, as did Ramachandran [Ram94]. <p> Vollmer and Wagner [VW93, VW95] gave a detailed structural examination of Krentel's hierarchy, as did Ramachandran [Ram94].

Let A be any set from 2 = P NP . In their paper on complexity classes of optimization problems, Vollmer and Wagner <ref> [VW95, Corollary 5.10] </ref> showed that there exists a function f 2 Max P such that the least significant bit of f is equal to the characteristic function c A of A. Thus, for all x, x 2 A if and only if f (x) is odd. <p> This implies MaxP NPMV, and since the hypothesis also implies NPMV = coNPMV, that MaxP coNPMV. 2 The previous two results relativize.
