Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning methods to learn domain-specific heuristics for job shop scheduling. A repair-based scheduler starts with a critical-path schedule and incrementally repairs constraint violations with the goal of finding a short conflict-free schedule. The temporal difference algorithm T D() is applied to train a neural network to learn a heuristic evaluation function over states. This evaluation function is used by a one-step looka-head search procedure to find good solutions to new scheduling problems. We evaluate this approach on synthetic problems and on problems from a NASA space shuttle payload processing task. The evaluation function is trained on problems involving a small number of jobs and then tested on larger problems. The TD sched-uler performs better than the best known existing algorithm for this task|Zweben's iterative repair method based on simulated annealing. The results suggest that reinforcement learning can provide a new method for constructing high-performance scheduling systems.

Reference-contexts: The resulting scheduling system provides an efficient and flexible facility for scheduling space shuttle ground operations. It is in regular use at the Kennedy Space Center <ref> [ Deale et al., 1994 ] </ref> . The challenge for a learning approach is to discover scheduling heuristics that can match or exceed the quality and efficiency of this iterative repair method. In the remainder of the paper, we describe the scheduling task in greater detail.

Reference-contexts: The 8 output units encode the predicted RDF using the technique of overlapping gaussian ranges <ref> [ Pomerleau, 1991 ] </ref> as follows. Each output unit represents one assigned RDF value, v j (j = 1; : : :; 8). For the artificial problems, these RDF values are v 1 = 0:8; v 2 = 1:0; : : : ; v 8 = 2:2.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, T D () will still converge under these conditions <ref> [ Sutton, 1988 ] </ref> . There are five further modifications that we made to this algorithm based on preliminary experiments. First, for any reinforcement learning algorithm it is critical to perform some kind of exploration to discover new and better ways of getting from the start state to the goal.

Reference-contexts: Of particular interest to NASA are scheduling methods that can also be used to repair a schedule when some unforeseen difficulty arises. In previous work on this task, Zweben and colleagues <ref> [ Zweben et al., 1994 ] </ref> developed an iterative repair-based scheduling procedure that combines a set of heuristics with a simulated annealing search procedure. The resulting scheduling system provides an efficient and flexible facility for scheduling space shuttle ground operations.
