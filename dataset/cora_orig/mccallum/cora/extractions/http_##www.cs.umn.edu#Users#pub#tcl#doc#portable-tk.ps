Title: Cross Platform Support in Tk  
Author: Ray Johnson Scott Stanton 
Affiliation: Sun Microsystems Laboratories  
Abstract: Tk currently supports a wide variety of X based platforms. In this paper we describe work in progress at Sun Microsystems Laboratories to make Tcl and Tk support non-X platforms. The changes described here will allow script writers to migrate Tk applications to Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh systems with little effort. In addition, scripts running on these systems will have the appropriate look and feel for each system.

Reference-contexts: M o s t W i n d o w s a n d Macintosh users are not familiar with the Motif look and feel, and there is strong evidence that users would reject a nonstandard interface <ref> [Apple92] </ref>. Second, we would like to have a script written on one pl at for m run unm odi fi ed on th e ot her platforms.

Reference-contexts: Menus Menus present an interesting problem for t h o s e c r e a t i n g p o r t a b l e a p p l i c a t i o n s <ref> [Nicholson91] </ref>. Various platforms have different models of where pull down menus belong and what they might contain. UNIX applications often do not have menu bars.

Reference-contexts: In the future, advanced font attributes could be supported without any loss of backward compatibility <ref> [White95] </ref>. This mechanism has an additional benefit. Right now, a script that needs to change the si ze of the font used by it s widgets is re q ui r e d t o se t th e -font configuration option on every single widget using the font.
