Abstract: This study reports the analysis of data collected during the execution of a reverse engineering process in a real environment. Essentially, the analysis assessed productivity aspects. The experience showed the need for automatic tools which can be adapted to the context the process is performed in and the possibility of anchoring the effort required for the reverse engineering to the desired product quality.

Reference-contexts: would help to make more specific analyses aiming to solve the problems of assessment of the process characteristics For the above reason, future work in this field will aim to introduce process formalization and enactement tools for automatic data collection and analysis of the data collected using the GQM model <ref> [Bas92] </ref>. Highest priority will be given to analyses providing econometric assessment of the RE process.

Reference-contexts: In fact, in view of the data presented here, it does not seem to be possible to base the estimates of cost of realization effort exclusively on the number of equivalent LOCs as in <ref> [Jar94] </ref> but becomes necessary to consider distinct models for the data and for the programs. Nor is it possible to use the model proposed in [Sne91a], where the productivity levels are weighed against factors derived from the characteristics of the system to be reversed.

Reference-contexts: In particular, there is very little information on the effort required to execute a RE process. A few authors have introduced some econometric information on the application of the process to real environments <ref> [Sne91a] </ref> but noone, so far as we know, has described the experimentation and analyzed the data collected so as to enable the experience acquired to be used, at any rate as a guide, by those intending to carry out a RE process. <p> Nor is it possible to use the model proposed in <ref> [Sne91a] </ref>, where the productivity levels are weighed against factors derived from the characteristics of the system to be reversed. For our process, it is impossible to formulate an econometric model to forecast the restoration effort because this depends on the restoration depth the project manager wishes to obtain.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Although there have been many publications concerned with the processes, methods and techniques of reverse engineeering (RE), few have taken into account experimental metrics which could provide some guides for researchers <ref> [Sne91b] </ref>. In particular, there is very little information on the effort required to execute a RE process.

Reference-contexts: The process model The process model on which the experimentation was based includes the RE activities described in the literature [Chi90] and the restoration activities described in the continuation of this paper and in greater detail in <ref> [Vis94a] </ref>. The process model is shown in fig. 2 and briefly outlined below. Inventory Software System . In this phase, all the elements composing the system are individuated and the source code is prepared for analysis in the MVS environment.

Reference-contexts: To complete the picture, it must be pointed out that the effort spent on the reverse engineering process is repaid by the consequent economical management of the application, as illustrated in detail in <ref> [Vis94b] </ref>. Many types of data on real case studies may be collected and many other results obtained from analysis but, as is well known, the data collection should be oriented towards more specific objectives.
