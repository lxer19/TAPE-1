Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations with an effective Hamiltonian parametrized from first principles are performed to study the dielectric response of BaTiO 3 as a function of temperature, with particular emphasis on the behavior of the dielectric constant near the transition from the ferroelectric tetragonal phase to the paraelectric cubic phase. The peculiar dielectric properties of ferroelectric materials stem from the coupling of the electric field to polar distortions of the crystal lattice. In one common scenario, the progressive softening of a lattice vibrational mode in the neighborhood of a phase transition brings about a dramatic rise in the value of the dielectric constant. The resulting very large relative permitivities (in the thousands range) have found important technological applications. From a practical point of view, however, the development of materials with a desired response faces the difficulty of trying to separate experimentally the influences of many effects: composition, structure, domain configuration, etc. There are also open theoretical issues such as whether the relevant phase transitions are indeed associated to the above-mentioned "soft-mode" (and are thus of "displacive" character) or exhibit "order-disorder" characteristics. The use of first-principles calculations can help in both fronts. They allow the study of the response of a system under "controlled" conditions that would be very difficult or impossible to realize in the laboratory. Besides, they provide a microscopic view of the materials which is simply not available experimentally and, unlike simplified models, they are tailored to the detailed chemical composition of the system. In the last few years much progress has been made in the computational study of ferroelectric materials through the use of effective Hamiltonians which contain the physically relevant degrees of freedom of the structure. The effective Hamiltoni-ans are constructed on the basis of first-principles calculations, and the statistical mechanics of the system is then studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Calculations

In conclusion, we have shown how the temperature-dependent dielectric response of a system can be computed from first principles using an effective Hamiltonian and Monte Carlo simulations.

Reference-contexts: This extended framework has recently been used to study the piezoelectric response of BaTiO 3 as a function of temperature, and to illustrate the influence of electric fields on the phase diagram of this material <ref> [6] </ref>. Here, we use this approach to compute the dielectric response of the cubic and the tetragonal (ferroelectric) phases of BaTiO 3 . The tetragonal phase is stable from approximately 278K to 403K and exhibits a spontaneous polarization that we take to be along the z axis.
Reference: 7. <editor> The linear change in volume is strictly zero by symmetry in the cubic phase, </editor> <title> and in the tetragonal phase for fields perpendicular to the ferroelectric axis. If an electric field is applied along the ferroelectric axis, the longitudinal elongation and the transverse contraction are such that the net change in volume is very nearly zero (the piezoelectric coefficients satisfy d 33 ' 2d 31 </title> ). 
Reference-contexts: Average polarization vs. electric field for the cubic phase of BaTiO 3 at a rescaled temperature of 500K. Solid triangles and open circles and squares represent the z, x, and y components of the polarization, respectively. The approximate equality reflects the neglect of the field derivative of the volume <ref> [7] </ref>. Here the averages are to be computed using the extended Boltzmann factor defined above [8].
Reference: 8. <editor> The relationship between and the polarization correlations can be simply obtained by differentiation of the expression flhXi = P j X j Prob j , where Prob j is the extended Boltzmann factor, </editor> <title> fl is the extended partition function, and X is any component of the net polarization. </title>

The approximate equality reflects the neglect of the field derivative of the volume [7]. Here the averages are to be computed using the extended Boltzmann factor defined above <ref> [8] </ref>. According to these equations, one could either compute the linear dielectric response from direct calculations of the average polarization as a function of electric field ("direct approach"), or from an analysis of the statistical correlation between polarization components ("correlation approach").

Reference-contexts: For each field value, the simulation box (a cube with 10 fi 10 fi 10 = 1000 unit cells) was allowed to equilibrate for 2fi10 4 Monte Carlo sweeps (MCS) <ref> [9] </ref> and polarization averages were taken over another 2fi10 4 MCS. A fit to the P z vs. E z curve in the linear region corresponding to field strengths up to approximately 150 kV/cm can be used to extract the dielectric susceptibility. For higher fields, nonlinear effects are clearly present.

Reference: 11. <institution> Another possible source of the error in the computed values of transition temper-atures is the underestimation by the LDA of the equilibrium lattice constant. </institution> <note> The simulations are run at a negative effective pressure to compensate for this effect (see Ref.

Reference-contexts: be related to the neglect of higher order terms in the interaction between local modes in H eff , as transition temperatures depend basically on the details of the interaction (as a simple example, recall the Ising model, for which T c is proportional to the spin-spin coupling J ) <ref> [11] </ref>. In order to provide a better comparison of our results to experiment, we have therefore linearly rescaled the theoretical temperatures so that the end points of the range of stability of the tetragonal phase coincide with the experimental T c 's.
