Abstract: Animals and humans exhibit many kinds of behavior where the frequencies of gestures are related by small integer ratios (like 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1). We show that speakers who repeat a short phrase to a metronome have a strong tendency to place the onsets of stressed syllables at temporal harmonic fractions of the metronome cycle (like 1/2, 1/3 and 2/3). Studies of errors by early language learners also show that some metrical patterns are easier than others. All these effects support a view of meter as an abstract dynamical system on the state space of two or more oscillators.

Reference-contexts: The notorious difficulty with these units is that they do not seem to be quite as regular as one might hope. Attempts to find isochronous stresses in English <ref> (as predicted by Abercrombie, 1967) </ref> have not been judged to be very successful (Lehiste, 1977; Dauer, 1983). Of course, what counts as success will necessarily depend on what method is employed to make measurements and on the computational theory that is presupposed.

Reference-contexts: For example, most joggers notice that during steady-state jogging, one's breathing tends to lock into a fixed relationship with the step cycle|with, say, two or three steps to each inhalation cycle, or perhaps three steps to two inhales <ref> (Bramble and Carrier, 1983) </ref>. To the runner it feels easier and less effortful and it probably is (Diedrich and Warren, 1995).

Reference-contexts: Of course, what counts as success will necessarily depend on what method is employed to make measurements and on the computational theory that is presupposed. A clock measuring in milliseconds is probably not an appropriate mechanism <ref> (Port, Cummins, McAuley, 1995) </ref>. But can self-entrainment be observed in speech? If so, then perhaps an alternative "clock" for speech timing can be created. A second place to look for entrainment would be in performance of songs or poetry (see, for example, Boomsliter and Creel, 1979). <p> In this case, we employed an automatic "beat extractor" that measured beat location (quite close to vowel onset) by seeking points of maximum energy increase in a rectified, smoothed energy measure over the formant frequency region (250-2500 Hz) of the speech signal <ref> (see Cummins, 1995) </ref>. The basic results, across the three rate conditions, are shown as a histogram of observed phases for the onset of "bush" in Figure 3. This subject showed a preference for placing the onset of "bush" at phase of either 0.47 (near 1/2) or at 0.62 (near 2/3). <p> For example, in another variant of the Speech Cycling task <ref> (Cummins, 1995, Cummins and Port, 1997) </ref>, subjects were asked to repeat the phrase "take a pack of cards" while listening to a periodic signal. But in this case, the signal was not a simple metronome beep, but rather a voice in synthetic speech saying both "take" and "cards".

Reference-contexts: Measurements of the location of one or more prominent syllable onsets, or `beats', can be made and interpreted as phase angles relative to the repetition cycle of the text fragment <ref> (Cummins and Port, 1997) </ref>. The basic task can be elaborated in various ways and various kinds of text fragments can be cycled in any language we wish. <p> From these data it is not clear whether there might be other modes near 0.3 and 0.6, but other experiments in our laboratory demonstrate that modes can often be found near 1/3 and 2/3 as well <ref> (Cummins and Port, 1997) </ref>. Of course, the preferred phase in both Figures 1 and 2 is not exactly 0.5. It appears to be closer to 0.46. <p> The effect of the rate condition (Increasing, Decreasing, Randomly-ordered) was inconclusive in these data, although a hysteresis effect (where the system tends to remain in the same attractor as the control parameter, rate, is changed) has been found in other experiments using variants of this task <ref> (Cummins, 1997) </ref>. The strongly bimodal distribution of Figure 3 confirms the observation from Experiment 1 that, when speaking along with a periodic signal, these speakers exhibit a preference to locate stress onsets at certain integral fractions of the phrase repetition period. <p> The preferred values were clearly 1/2, 1/3 and 2/3|the three largest harmonic fractions of 1. These and other experiments <ref> (see Cummins and Port, 1997) </ref> encourage confidence that the harmonic timing effect in speech cycling tasks is highly robust. In fact, the effect is not limited to English speakers, but is also found among Japanese speakers (Tajima, 1997). <p> Each panel reveals multiple preferred internal phases for the medial stressed syllable. 14 panel a) and 3B (in panels b-e). The scale at the top and bottom divides phase into 12 equal parts. Syllable onsets were obtained from the beat extraction procedure <ref> (Cummins and Port, 1997) </ref>. alternating stress pattern of the phrase does not simply result in a weakening of overall stability. Instead, it apparently yields several stable modes, some of which are weaker in their degree of stability than in the unimodal case in the previous experiment.

Reference-contexts: However, various kinds of temporal units have been proposed for speech in various languages: inter-stress intervals in English (Martin, 1972), the mora in Japanese (Port, Dalby, and O'Dell, 1987; Han, 1994), the bisyllabic foot in Finnish and Estonian <ref> (Lehiste, 1990) </ref>, etc. The notorious difficulty with these units is that they do not seem to be quite as regular as one might hope.

Reference-contexts: And any particular meter is defined by statements like "A waltz has three beats per measure". It then follows from universal principles that the first one of the three will be the accented or special beat <ref> (Lerdahl and Jackendoff, 1983) </ref> . The rate or period of basic beats happens to be close to the motions that can be made by swinging a human finger, hand, arm or leg. In linguistics too, meter has become a standard notion over the past 30 years.

Reference-contexts: These and other experiments (see Cummins and Port, 1997) encourage confidence that the harmonic timing effect in speech cycling tasks is highly robust. In fact, the effect is not limited to English speakers, but is also found among Japanese speakers <ref> (Tajima, 1997) </ref>. Accordingly we conclude that the Harmonic Timing Effect is a remarkably strong set of constraints on the timing of speech under conditions that encourage settling. Such conditions include our speech cycling task, as well as chanting, poetry reading, singing while working together, group recitation, etc. <p> One of the most striking of these similarities is the tendency to get locked into synchronization with one or another meter. Our expectation is that related effects will be found in the speech of any natural language <ref> (see, for example, Tajima, 1997) </ref>. It is possible that oscillator entrainment is one of the primary methods for global timing control in complex activity by animals. Self-entrainment may be the most basic and easily observable evidence of this method of timing. <p> Experiment 3B is part of a larger investigation on cross-linguistic comparisons of speech rhythm <ref> (Tajima, 1997) </ref>, but here we will look closely at data from two typical English phrases, shown in Table I. These two phrases, "Betty forgot the bag" and "bake the beans in a den", each contain three stressed syllables.

Reference-contexts: Gerken asked children to produce simple sentences and noted the effect of phonological and metrical details on their ability to perform the task. It turns out that the metrical structure of the sentences had a large effect on performance <ref> (cf. also Wijnen, Krikhaar and den Os, 1994) </ref>. For example in one experiment, children averaging around 24 months of age played with small plastic models of animals and people with personal names.

Reference-contexts: But in this case, the signal was not a simple metronome beep, but rather a voice in synthetic speech saying both "take" and "cards". Thus the phase of the second foot onset was specified as a target phase angle and the repetition rate was kept constant <ref> (cf. Yamanishi, Kawato and Suzuki, 1980) </ref>. The target phase for cards ranged from 0.3 to 0.65. Again here, an automatic beat extractor was employed to locate syllable onsets in subjects' productions.
