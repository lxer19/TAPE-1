Abstract: Health care is a complex and transnational task of societies. The various institutions and individuals involved are not and should not be governed by one central authority, but have legitimate and sometimes diverging interests. Balancing these interests has been subject to organizational and legal procedures traditionally. Today, institutions like hospitals and practices are no longer employers of isolated ITsystems, but they increasingly collaborate by means of a transnational network of various highly efficient database and datatransfer components, etc. Balancing all legitimate interests demands too much of organizational measures and, thus, requires direct support by the ITsystems themselves. The most important implication for the specification of such systems is that it must explicitly allow different parties to distrust different components of the system. We start from a simple specification of a secure system and unfold it with respect to typical requirements of health care. Health and life are a basic value of a society. E.g., the potential of personal development strongly depends upon a person's state of health and sanity, upon one's own and other people's knowledge about it. The elementary relationship of health care is the one between patient and physician. Naturally, it is characterized by the patient's trust into the physician's personal skills and the physician's obligation to use his skills, his knowledge and the technology available for him to cure the patient, at reasonable cost. In these respects the patient-physician relationship differs from most other relationships, e.g., in business or military, which are potentially less individual. Essential prerequisites for effective patient care are professional secrecy of physicians (oath of Hippocrates) and informational self-determination of patients, physicians and medical staff. The informational self-determination of physicians and medical staff, however, must be carefully balanced against the society's interest in preventing misuse. Generally, informational self-determination is another basic value of a society. A lot of institutions like hospitals, health insurances, regional, national, and international authorities are supporting the patient-physician relationships. Accordingly, financial clearing between all patients, physicians, and institutions involved is a tremendous task which gives rise to consider a third basic value of a society: property.
