Abstract: For a polyhedral terrain , the contour at z-coordinate h, denoted C h , is defined to be the intersection of the plane z = h with . In this paper, we study the contour-line extraction problem, where we want to preprocess into a data structure so that given a query z-coordinate h, we can report C h quickly. This is a central problem that arises in geographic information systems (GIS), where terrains are often stored as Triangular Irregular Networks (TINs). We present an I/O-optimal algorithm for this problem which stores a terrain with N vertices using O(N=B) blocks, where B is the size of a disk block, so that for any query h, the contour C h can be computed using O(log B N + jC h j=B) I/O operations, where jC h j denotes the size of C h . We also present an improved algorithm for a more general problem of blocking bounded-degree planar graphs such as TINs (i.e., storing them on disk so that any graph traversal algorithm can traverse the graph in an I/O-efficient manner), and apply it to two problems that arise in GIS.
