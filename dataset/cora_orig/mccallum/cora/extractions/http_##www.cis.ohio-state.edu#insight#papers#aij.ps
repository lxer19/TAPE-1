Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Analysis of dynamical systems via phase-space geometric structures plays an increasingly important role in experimenting, interpreting, and controlling complex systems <ref> [1] </ref>. Nonlinear systems usually fall outside the domain of traditional analysis methods, such as Fourier analysis for linear systems. However, most of the important qualitative behaviors of a nonlinear system can be made explicit in phase space with a geometric analysis [19]. <p> Qualitative analysis of dynamics is concerned with deriving symbolic descriptions and constraints of the dynamics of a physical system from simulations. The MAPS program falls into this category. Abelson at al. described a collection of computer programs that automatically analyze dynamical systems at the level of expert dynamicists <ref> [1] </ref>. Yip has constructed a program, KAM, for automatically analyzing Hamilto- nian systems with two degrees of freedom in two-dimensional phase sections [27]. The program uses techniques from computer vision to cluster trajectory points in phase sections and classifies phase portraits into meaningful categories.

Reference-contexts: Another possible extension is to augment the current program with a bifurcation analysis, similar to Abelson's Bifurcation Interpreter <ref> [2] </ref>. 6.3 The use of MAPS in visualization The qualitative phase-space description can assist engineers in designing controllers for complex systems. We envision that a control engineer uses MAPS to observe qualitative changes of phase-space structures when varying control parameters. These changes include: 1.

Reference-contexts: The triangulation is computed with the Delaunay method on the set of points which results in a tessellation of the convex hull of these points with simplices. The polyhedral approximation is then extracted from the triangulation by a sculpture method used in visual information representation <ref> [3] </ref>, followed by a more expensive centroid method. <p> In order to extract the polyhedron, simplices exterior to the polyhedron have to be eliminated. For geometric structures with relatively smooth surfaces, i.e., small curvatures, the exterior simplices are eliminated with a relatively fast and inexpensive method using the circumsphere heuristics <ref> [3] </ref>. We observe that only certain type of sim- plices that satisfy the so-called "visibility conditions" can be exterior ones and are therefore candidates for elimination. We associate a value V with each candidate. <p> For example, more points are needed to approximate the boundary of a region with finger-like narrow parts, as shown in Figure 14 (b). The sculpture method is stated as follows: Algorithm 4.1 Sculpture method <ref> [3] </ref>: 1. Construct a set G of all simplices in the triangulation and a set H of candidate simplices satisfying "visibility conditions"; 2. Order the simplices of H according to their V values; 3. Consider the simplex s of H having the least V .

Reference-contexts: The partition respects the geometry of the phase space. Because of the hierarchical (top-down) nature of Hsu's method, it can be integrated with MAPS in refining an approximation for a stability region. Recently, Bradley uses an adaptive grid to explore phase-space chaotic features <ref> [4] </ref>; the program Perfect Moment identifies phase-space features like strange attractors and searches for useful trajectory segments in a gridded phase space. 7.2 Engineering Stability Analysis A well-known class of methods for engineering stability analysis is the so-called Liapunov-function based constructions for stability regions (domains of attraction).

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm for determining stability boundaries is based on a crucial theoretical result characterizing the stability boundaries of a fairly large class of dynamical systems 3 . Under certain weak conditions to be discussed in Section 6.1, the result of Chi- ang et al. <ref> [6] </ref> shows that the stability boundary for an attractor consists of the stable trajectories (stable manifold) of equilibrium points and limit cycles whose unstable trajectories (unstable manifold) approach the attractor. <p> In higher dimensions, the boundary surfaces are swept out by a set of trajectories on the boundary. The following theorem establishes the theoretical basis for the stability analysis of the algorithm. Theorem 4.1 Characterization of stability boundaries for attractors [Chi- ang et al. <ref> [6] </ref>]: For nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems satisfying certain conditions, the stability boundary for an attractor is the union of stable manifolds of equilibrium points and limit cycles, whose unstable manifolds approach the attractor. 3 Our algorithm does not use Liapunov functions to construct stability regions. <p> to which our method applies, further extensions to MAPS, and the role of MAPS in assisting control engineers in visualizing behaviors of dynamical systems. 6.1 Scope of the analysis We have stated that the theoretical basis of our algorithm for locating stability boundaries is the result of Chiang et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. Chiang et al. give a topological and dynamical characterization of the stability boundaries for a class of autonomous dynamical systems and show that the stability boundary of an attractor is formed by the stable trajectories of equilibrium points and limit cycles on the boundary.

The Work- bench is implemented on HP 700 series workstations. For moderately difficult problems, for example, the buckling steel column example, it takes the Workbench on the order of minutes to arrive at a control law. Internally, a point in phase space is a vector of the coordinates.

Reference-contexts: A Liapunov function is a family of closed surfaces such that a system trajectory remains in the region bounded by a surface after the trajectory 28 enters. The Liapunov function is difficult to construct. Numerous algorithms have been proposed for this construction. Reference <ref> [8] </ref> gives a survey of these algorithms. Most of the algorithms assume special forms of the Liapunov functions and determine the unspecified coefficients in the functions. They usually result in conservative estimations.

Reference-contexts: In general, the equilibrium points of a dynamical system dx = f (x; u), where u is a parameter, are the zeros of the vector field f (x; u) : R n ! R n . Structurally stable systems <ref> [9] </ref> can have equilibrium points of three types: attractor, repellor, and saddle, whose local behaviors in phase spaces are shown in Figure 8. An attractor is an equilibrium point that all nearby trajectories approach in forward time. In the pendulum example, the downward resting state is an attractor. <p> Conditions (1) and (2) are generic properties satisfied by almost all dynamical systems. The example in Section 5.4 that has a saddle connection violates condition (2). Structurally stable systems satisfy the generic conditions (1) and (2) (see [10, 24] for a definition of generic properties and <ref> [9] </ref> for discussions on structural stability of dynamical systems). Since many systems encountered in engineering applications are structurally stable, we further restrict ourselves to structurally 9 Consider the Jacobian of the vector field at an equilibrium point. <p> Structural stability implies the absence of quasi-periodic orbits. Condition (3) excludes some structurally stable systems. Our method applies to a fairly large class of autonomous dynamical systems as defined by the three conditions. We note that a periodic non-autonomous dynamical system can be converted into an autonomous system <ref> [9] </ref> and can also be analyzed by MAPS. In its current implementation, MAPS does not handle systems having chaotic attractors, in which stability regions and/or stability boundaries exhibit fractal structures.

Reference-contexts: For example, the geometries of stability regions are modeled in this representation; the sizes of the regions are directly linked to certain design parameters. Another related approach is Hsu's cell-to-cell mapping for approximating state spaces <ref> [11] </ref>. A continuous state space is discretized into regular cells forming a cell space. The associated map of a system becomes a cell-to-cell map which maps one cell to another cell.

Reference-contexts: The cir- cumsphere heuristic method terminates before all the boundary trajectory points are on the boundary of the polyhedral approximation. The centroid method is required to eliminate the remaining triangles. The centroid method is implemented by an unraveling algorithm, adapted from the cell-to-cell algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>, which links together simplices according to the mapping of their centroids under trajectory flows.

Reference-contexts: This polyhedron is not unique. We choose the one computed from the Delaunay triangulation to be discussed shortly. A polyhedral structure is a consequence of the so-called simplicial representation. The elements of a simplicial representation consist of simplices <ref> [13] </ref>. An n-dimensional simplex, or an n-simplex for short, determined by n + 1 geometrically independent points 5 is the convex hull of the points. These points act as vertices of the n-simplex. <p> The simplicial structure, on the other hand, is a much coarser representation for describing qualitative features of geometric pieces. The simplicial representation is independent of the dimensions, permits recursive decomposition, and is characterized by certain algebraic signatures such as fundamental groups <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The representation contains information about the geometries of stability regions. Nishida et al. described a program for analyzing second-order nonlinear systems in phase space <ref> [14] </ref>. The program uses a flow grammar to specify possible patterns of solution curves in the phase plane and is restricted to two-dimensional flows. Much of the difference between MAPS and the above cited work is due to the fact that the analysis MAPS performs is meant for control design.

Reference-contexts: It embodies theoretical knowledge about nonlinear dynamical systems and formulates in computational terms a significant amount of informal working knowledge of professional control engineers in analyzing complex control systems, in particular, in the form of the phase-plane method <ref> [15] </ref>. We will illustrate our techniques of extracting and representing the qualitative phase-space features with two- and three-dimensional systems. The techniques presented in this paper also apply to higher-dimensional dynamical systems. Complex systems are often nonlinear and high dimensional.

Reference-contexts: These numerical states could then be analyzed and clustered to form phase portraits. The phase space could also be reconstructed from a measured time series of just one state variable, using a technique called delay coordinates introduced in <ref> [16, 26] </ref>. We have presented the MAPS algorithm for determining stability regions of attractors; the algorithm remains essentially the same for those of attracting limit cycles, as we noted earlier that our geometric extraction technique is applicable to stability regions of attracting limit cycles.

Reference-contexts: eliminated first by heuristic rules and then by testing their membership in the stability region with trajectories emanating from the centroids of the simplices. 12 We have implemented the Delaunay triangulation in n dimensions that supports incremental insertion and deletion of points, adapted from an algorithm proposed for planar triangulation <ref> [17] </ref>. The time complexity of the algorithm grows exponentially with the dimensions, so does the number of simplices in the triangulation. For N points in n spatial dimensions, the time and space complexities scale as N O (n) [20].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the stable trajectories labeled "b" of the saddle form the stability boundary for the attractor. Figure 11 (b) shows a stability region with degenerate boundary labeled "b". Parker and Chua have generalized Theorem 4.1 to characterize stability boundaries for attracting limit cycles <ref> [18] </ref>. The corresponding result remains much the same as Theorem 4.1 except that the occurrences of "attractor" in Theorem 4.1 are substituted with the words "attracting limit cycle". Figure 12 schematically illustrates the stability boundary for an attracting limit cycle. The boundary is formed by two repelling limit cycles. <p> The second rule describes the separation property of multiple stability regions. The separatrices are stability boundaries that separate two stability regions. The first step of our algorithm is based on a numerical method proposed by Parker and Chua <ref> [18] </ref> for numerically determining stability boundaries of planar systems. We have augmented their method with the set of consistency rules they suggested to automate the locating of saddles.

Reference-contexts: Nonlinear systems usually fall outside the domain of traditional analysis methods, such as Fourier analysis for linear systems. However, most of the important qualitative behaviors of a nonlinear system can be made explicit in phase space with a geometric analysis <ref> [19] </ref>. MAPS is a program for understanding and representing qualitative structures of phase spaces. MAPS combines numerical, symbolic, and geometric computations with techniques of spatial reasoning.

Reference-contexts: For example, a triangulation on a set of points on a two-dimensional surface divides up the surface into triangular regions. Among possible triangulations over these points, the Delaunay triangulation <ref> [20] </ref> 5 A set of points fx 0 , x 1 , ..., x n g of R N (N n) is said to be geometrically independent, if and only if the vectors x 1 x 0 , ..., x n x 0 are linearly independent. <p> The time complexity of the algorithm grows exponentially with the dimensions, so does the number of simplices in the triangulation. For N points in n spatial dimensions, the time and space complexities scale as N O (n) <ref> [20] </ref>. Under the condition that the distribution of boundary points is reasonably dense and uniform on the boundary, the polyhedron approximating the stability region is contained in the triangulation of the convex hull. Furthermore, the union of all the circumspheres of interior simplices is a good approximation for the region.

Reference-contexts: The first step of our algorithm is based on a numerical method proposed by Parker and Chua [18] for numerically determining stability boundaries of planar systems. We have augmented their method with the set of consistency rules they suggested to automate the locating of saddles. Since the Newton-Raphson method <ref> [21] </ref> used in finding equilibrium points requires an initial guess, the Parker- Chua method uses a grid to set up initial guesses and is able to find all the stable and unstable equilibrium points under normal circumstances. <p> It uses a triangulation method to tessellate the phase space of the system and computes polyhedral approximations to the regions. MAPS internally represents a trajectory with a sequence of integration points. It uses an adaptive 4th-order Runge-Kutta method <ref> [21] </ref> to integrate trajectories and to generate the boundary points that approximate a stability boundary. The third step refines the triangulation from the second step and constructs flow pipes, using the information about the stability boundaries. The unstable trajectories of saddles connect the saddles with the attractors.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of these methods scales with the order of the systems and the order of the polynomials assumed for the Liapunov function. Manually computing the coefficients of the polynomials is very tedious. Macsyma-like symbolic packages employing computer algebra techniques can automatically determine these coefficients <ref> [22] </ref>. Much work remains in the area of applying symbolic methods to the construction of the Liapunov functions. 8 Conclusion We have developed a qualitative method for automatically analyzing phase-space structures of nonlinear dynamical systems and have constructed MAPS to demonstrate the method.

Reference-contexts: MAPS constructs a simplicial representation for the phase-space qualitative features based on geometric pieces, as required by the task of control design. KAM uses a point-set representation instead. Sacks' Poincare program analyzes planar systems through a partition algorithm on phase spaces and a bifurcation analysis on one parameter <ref> [23] </ref>. The partition algorithm determines flow patterns in the plane using the properties of two-dimensional flows. These properties are based on the Jordan Curve Theorem and the fact that trajectories are one-dimensional curves that do not intersect. However, the special properties about two-dimensional flows do not generalize to higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: The representation needs to preserve the gross features of shape of the structure with minimum complexity. Yip has used a point-set representation for the phase-space geometries and topologies in analyzing two-dimensional Hamiltonian maps <ref> [27] </ref>. While the point-set representation has been successfully used to recognize patterns of the phase portraits, it is not suitable for the purpose of cutting and pasting trajectory flows and synthesizing desired phase-space geometry and topology. <p> The MAPS program falls into this category.

The program uses techniques from computer vision to cluster trajectory points in phase sections and classifies phase portraits into meaningful categories. MAPS works in the domain of dissipative dynamical systems; it analyzes the systems in their continuous phase spaces regardless of their dimensions.
