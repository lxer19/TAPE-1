Abstract: We discuss several architectural choices possible in logical multiplexing, accommodating QoS dynamics, and functional divisions between senders and receivers. Our application requirements favor integration rather than channelization, supporting QoS dynamics with a renegotiation mechanism, and pushing complexity towards receivers. We are testing the choices via implementation of a telerobotics/teleoperation application. This application is particularly challenging due to its demand for multiple concurrent media streams with varied QoS requirements.

Reference-contexts: An important architectural implication is that admission control must take into account the ability to schedule activities associated with the hard real-time streams. 3 Application to Telerobotics 3.1 Why Teleoperation We are exploring our approach in the context of an actual application, that of telerobotics and distributed digital teleoperation <ref> [1] </ref>. The teler-obotics/teleoperation application is a non-trivial application and provides many challenges to network research. The reason is that the involved media sensory, data, audio and video, with their complex application requirements, fill different portions of the QoS parameter space as it is shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: Some negotiation protocols are proposed in the ISO 95 work, but application-to-network communication appears problematic due to the strictness of the OSI peer-to-peer architecture. Jung and Seret <ref> [2] </ref> have proposed a translation scheme for layer-to-layer communication, but have not exploited their scheme in either a broader distributed applications context or an experimental setting. 1.3 Organization of the Paper The description of our 'integrated' approach, which uses negotiation/ renegotiation, as well as activity scheduling based on QoS, is given

Reference-contexts: Differentiation was done with a control flag in the data unit [15]. The application-driven approach is based on an extensive body of work on real-time transport protocols, and architectures [6] for achieving real-time goals such as low jitter [5] and low delay <ref> [3] </ref>. Some negotiation protocols are proposed in the ISO 95 work, but application-to-network communication appears problematic due to the strictness of the OSI peer-to-peer architecture. <p> For the network QoS parameter 1 Figures 1-4 are at the end of the paper set, we have found the parameters used in the Berkeley Tenet protocol suite <ref> [3] </ref> to be suitable. The application QoS parameters and network QoS are clearly different ways of talking about the behavior of a system two different languages. <p> The specification and design of the QoS broker as well as negotiation/ renegotiation of application QoS are implemented as part of the telerobotics project. Currently we are working as on the implementation of network guaranteed services for our ATM network using ideas described in <ref> [3] </ref> and [4], as well as the extended connection and call management, (including negotiation/renegotiation of network QoS) described in section 2. 4 Conclusion The main contribution of this paper is an architecture for propagating an integrated sensory environment between elements of a complex distributed appli cation.

Reference-contexts: Renegotiated QoS values allow the dynamics of the application to be more precisely reflected in its demands on the network, and allow the network resources to be better managed through cooperation with applications <ref> [7] </ref>. 1.2 Related Work The multi-channel approach is implemented in the Distributed Multiparty Desktop Conferencing System (MERMAID) [14]. Video, voice and data are transmitted using two ISDN B-channels. Unfortunately, the ISDN B-channel bandwidth is insufficient for transmitting clear video images in real-time and the delay is unacceptable for many applications. <p> Thus, the connection set up is tied to negotiation of QoS parameters. The admission protocol performs actions to guarantee them (admission-reservation, admission-allocation) of resources at the end-points. Detailed translation examples and the functionality of the QoS broker, as well as dependencies between negotiation/renegotiation process elements are further described in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.3 QoS Guarantees Scheduling based on QoS It is clear that the computer system software must participate in service delivery. The negotiation and admission control can offer their guarantees only if scheduling based on QoS is available as a service for QoS guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the ISDN B-channel bandwidth is insufficient for transmitting clear video images in real-time and the delay is unacceptable for many applications. Another multi-channel system is the Bellcore Integrated Media Architecture Laboratory's (IMAL) system, called Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) <ref> [10] </ref>. CSCW is concerned with internetworking and integration of networked CAD/CAE resources, as well as net-worked facilities for multi-media teleconferencing and messaging, embedded in a multimedia environment. CSCW is implemented using three different networks. <p> CSCW is implemented using three different networks. Control data and text data are transmitted over a LAN, video transport is provided by analog coaxial cable carrying NTSC signals, and audio transport is provided by analog balanced-line low-impedance cabling <ref> [10] </ref>. There are efforts towards an interleaving approach for network transmission by the MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group). The activities cover video com pression, associated audio compression, audio-video synchronization and the issue of synchronization and multiplexing of multiple compressed audio and video bit streams [8].

Reference-contexts: The network QoS requirements have to be mapped further into a scheduler based on QoS. An extensive body of work on scheduling based on QoS in switches exists; an example scheme is described by Hyman, et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. We partition traffic at the end-points into three basic classes using deadline times as the partitioning relation: * hard real-time deadline media streams (tactile data & kinesthetic), * soft real-time deadline media streams (audio, video streams), * non-real time deadline media streams .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Modern high-speed computer communications networks <ref> [13] </ref> allow multiple high-bandwidth media applications on a single network fabric. These new networks are also characterized by their flexibility the combination of packet-switching and intelligent terminal equipment permits considerable customization of a channel. Customizations might include allocated bandwidths and controlled interarrival delays.

Reference-contexts: A BIT3 bus connector card connects the JIFFE processor with the IBM RS/6000 workstation. The hardware and device drivers on the RS/6000 are functional; we have achieved application-to-application bandwidths up to 130 Mbps <ref> [17] </ref> and feedback loops operating successfully at over 500Hz. This 500Hz figure is achieved at the interfaces between the robotics control/communication unit; and should be sustainable over small ATM networks.
