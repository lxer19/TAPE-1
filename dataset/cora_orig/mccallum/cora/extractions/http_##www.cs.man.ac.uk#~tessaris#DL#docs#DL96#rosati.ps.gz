Title: On the semantics of epistemic description logics (Extended Abstract)

Abstract: The modal description logic ALCK both constitutes a promising framework for reasoning about actions and allows for the formalization of several non-first-order aspects of KR systems based on DLs. However, other non-monotonic features of DL-based KR systems, in particular role and concept closure inside the knowledge base, lack an intuitive formalization in this modal framework. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a modification of the semantics for ALCK, which consists in allowing selective minimization of primitive concepts and roles, thus providing for a correct formalization of the notion of role and concept closure.

Reference-contexts: reasoning about actions [ De Giacomo et al., 1996 ] and allows for the formalization of several non-first-order aspects of KR systems based on DLs [ Borgida et al., 1989; MacGregor, 1988 ] , like procedural rules, defaults, a weak form of concept definition and some forms of closed-world reasoning <ref> [ Donini et al., 1994; 1995 ] </ref> . However, other nonmonotonic features of DL-based KR systems, in particular role and concept closure inside the knowledge base, lack an intuitive formalization in this modal framework. We illustrate such notions through two examples. Example 1 (Concept closure).
