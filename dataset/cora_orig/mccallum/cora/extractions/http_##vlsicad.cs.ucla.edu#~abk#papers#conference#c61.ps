Abstract: In this paper, we analyze coupled transmission lines and obtain a relationship between the moments of the coupled transfer functions. We then derive expressions for the first and second moments of the coupled transfer function which can be used to compute the response and threshold delays under various input excitations. We can compute the interconnect delay under parasitic coupling effects by using the analytic delay formulas given in [8, 9] for step and ramp inputs. We also present the analysis to compute the general k th moment for the coupled interconnect lines.
