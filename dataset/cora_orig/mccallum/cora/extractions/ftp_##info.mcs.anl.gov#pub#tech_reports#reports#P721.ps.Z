Reference-contexts: Computations show that the solution behaves like a traveling wave, u (x; t) tanh x x fl (t) as t ! 1: (1.12) The location of the transition layer varies with time and converges, albeit extremely slowly, to a limiting value x fl 1 <ref> [11] </ref>. Indeed, asymptotic analysis shows that x fl (t) varies on a time scale of order 1=ffi [12, 13]. This fact, combined with the supersensitive dependence of x fl (t) on the perturbation ffi, makes the accurate computation of x fl 1 extremely difficult and time-consuming.

Reference-contexts: An example from combustion theory shows that supersensitivity is of more than mathematical significance. A simple model of flame propagation in gaseous fuels involves a system of two coupled convection-diffusion equations, one for the temperature of the mixture, another for the concentration of the reaction-limiting component in the mixture <ref> [14, Section 3.2] </ref>. If one ignores exponentially small perturbations in the data, one finds that the Lewis number L, which is a measure for the ratio of heat and mass transfer in the mixture, has no effect on the location of the combustion front.

Reference-contexts: Note that the modified algorithm (2.8) treats the second-order derivative explicitly in the region where H j 0 and implicitly in the region where H j 1. The idea of using a cutoff function to construct a composite algorithm is described in detail in our article <ref> [23] </ref>. The procedure offers a very general tool for the design of heterogeneous domain decompositions in the framework of a finite-difference approximation.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is therefore not suitable for long-time integration. The alternative approach commonly taken is to use a fully implicit scheme in combination with a Newton algorithm <ref> [24] </ref>. However, an implicit scheme can be expensive, especially in two or three dimensions. For many singular perturbation problems, there is another choice, which is suggested by asymptotic analysis.

Reference-contexts: Additional parallelism can be introduced by decomposing the domain in the x direction. However, our experience with a similar algorithm for combustion problems indicates a potentially significant decrease (as much as 70%) in the efficiency of the algorithm <ref> [26] </ref>. In general, the algorithm (3.24) is very well adapted to the quasi one-dimensional structure of the transition layer.
