Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for the oxidation of silicon carbide in a crack or pore. The model consists of a nonlinear partial differential system that is solved by adaptive finite element software that automates many of the computational decisions. 1. INTRODUCTION

Reference-contexts: Phase transformations due to the oxidizing reactions are accompanied by a volume expansion that causes the viscous SiO 2 to flow and fill the crack [1-3]. This may reduce damage to the composite. The model, consisting of a nonlinear partial differential system, is solved by adaptive finite element software <ref> [4] </ref> with capabilities for unstructured mesh generation and combinations of automatic mesh refine 1 ment/coarsening (h-refinement), method-order variation (p-refinement), and mesh motion (r-refinement). Adaptivity helps control numerical accuracy and track moving material boundaries; hence, it provides an effective tool for solving oxidation and related [5] composite fabrication problems. <p> A dimensionless version of the partial differential system (4, 5, 7-10) is solved using adaptive finite element software that has capabilities for automatic h-, p-, and/or r-refinement [4,5]. Although p-refinement is very efficient <ref> [4] </ref>, we use hr-refinement with piecewise linear polynomials (p = 1). The r-refinement is used to follow evolving reaction zones and track the solid-gas interface as the matrix expands. The h-refinement is used to increase solution resolution near sharp transitions.

Reference-contexts: Adaptivity helps control numerical accuracy and track moving material boundaries; hence, it provides an effective tool for solving oxidation and related <ref> [5] </ref> composite fabrication problems. The model and its solution by the adaptive software produce an efficient way to predict and understand changes in the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of composites that will eventually lead to improved design and longer material life. 2. <p> Table I). Thus, aeY i =M i , is the concentration of species i in mol=cm 3 . Assuming that a control volume V contains only chemical constituents without voids between the compounds, Adjerid et al. <ref> [5] </ref> show that 3 r v = i=1 ^ae i [ _q i + r D i raeY i ]; x 2 ; t &gt; 0: (6) where ^ae i is the theoretical density of species i.

Reference-contexts: The h-refinement is used to increase solution resolution near sharp transitions. Adaptive h-refinement is guided by two elemental error indicators: j is a mean-square average of jumps in @aeY 4 =@n across the edges of element and i is a similar average of jumps in the components of @v=@n <ref> [6] </ref>. Letting j and i, respectively, denote averages of j and i over all elements, we refine those elements where j &gt; 1:8j or i &gt; 2:2 i. A vertex is scheduled for coarsening when the error indicators on all elements containing it are less than 0:3j and 0:7 i. <p> This eliminates elements and coarsens the mesh. Badly shaped elements that may result from r-refinement are eliminated by a combination of edge swapping (exchanging the diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by two triangular elements) and vertex collapsing <ref> [6] </ref>. The variable-step, variable-order time integration [4-6] was performed with a temporal error tolerance of 10 4 and was halted every five time steps to examine the error indicators and refine, coarsen, or move the mesh as necessary.

Reference-contexts: Using symmetry, we solve a problem on the upper half of the matrix shown in Figure 1. Those parameter values available in the literature <ref> [7] </ref> at an operating temperature of 1100 o C are D 1 = 6:6 fi 10 13 , D 6 = 3:6 fi 10 11 (m 2 =s), ^ae 4 = 3:2, ^ae 5 = 2:2 (g=cm 3 ), and 5 = 5 = 10 12 (N s=m 2 ).

Reference-contexts: When used with adaptive finite element software, the model predicted qualitatively correct chemical and mechanical behavior and quantitatively correct mass gain. Our model displays a closing crack, which should inhibit oxidation. We will integrate this software into an overall mechanism-based design system <ref> [8] </ref> that will simplify future analyses. Computational results will be compared with existing [1,2] and planned experiments. Several improvements are possible. We are testing a model for the gaseous flow in the crack that contains a combination of Fickian and Knudsen diffusion. <p> With these, it should be possible to predict the formation of cracks in the SiO 2 as oxidation progresses and stress patterns change. Coupling these micro-scale models with macro-mechanical models that anticipate the behavior of the composite structure are also envisioned <ref> [8] </ref>.
