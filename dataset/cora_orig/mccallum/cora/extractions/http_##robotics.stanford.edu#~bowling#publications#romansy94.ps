Abstract: Characterizing the acceleration properties at the end effector is crucial for the analysis, design, and control of robot manipulators. In previous efforts aimed at addressing this problem, the end-effector acceleration has been treated as a vector combining both the linear and angular accelerations. The methodology presented in this article provides characterizations of these two different types of accelerations and describes the relationship between them. This work is a extension of our previous studies on manipulator inertial and acceleration properties. The treatment relies on the ellipsoid expansion model, a simple geometric approach to efficiently analyze end-effector accelerations. Results of the application of this analysis to the PUMA 560 manipulator are discussed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The end-effector acceleration is an important measure of the dynamic performance of a manipulator. Yoshikawa <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid (DME) to characterize this acceleration. In order to deal with the differences between linear and angular accelerations, Yoshikawa used scaling factors to bring their magnitudes into range with each other.

Reference-contexts: Yoshikawa [1] proposed the dynamic manipulability ellipsoid (DME) to characterize this acceleration. In order to deal with the differences between linear and angular accelerations, Yoshikawa used scaling factors to bring their magnitudes into range with each other. In another study, Khatib and Burdick <ref> [2] </ref> proposed the hyper-parallelepiped of acceleration for the description of the end-effector acceleration characteristics. Their hyper-parallelepiped is obtained from the torque/acceleration relationship, which maps the hyper-cube of normalized torque bounds into accelerations. Inscribing a hyper-sphere in the acceleration hyper-parallelepiped yields a measure of the isotropic acceleration.

Reference-contexts: Scaling factors were also used to deal with the differences between linear and angular accelerations. The mapping of torque bounds into end-effector accelerations has been also analyzed by Kim and Desa <ref> [3] </ref>. However, rotational motions were not treated in their study. By their different natures, linear and angular accelerations are difficult to analyze as components of a single vector. The use of scaling to address this problem does not lessen the difficulty in practice.
