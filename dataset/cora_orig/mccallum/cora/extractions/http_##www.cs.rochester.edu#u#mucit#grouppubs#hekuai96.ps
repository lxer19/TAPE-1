Abstract: Uncertainty may be taken to characterize inferences, their conclusions, their premises or all three. Under some treatments of uncertainty, the inference itself is never characterized by uncertainty. We explore both the signiflcance of uncertainty in the premises and in the conclusion of an argument that involves uncertainty. We argue that for uncertainty to characterize the conclusion of an inference is natural, but that there is an interplay between uncertainty in the premises and uncertainty in the procedure of argument itself. We show that it is possible in principle to incorporate all uncertainty in the premises, rendering uncertainty arguments deductively valid. But we then argue (1) that this does not reect human argument, (2) that it is computa-tionally costly, and (3) that the gain in simplicity obtained by allowing uncertainty in inference can sometimes outweigh the loss of exibility it entails. keywords: uncertainty, inference, logic, argument, decision, premises.

Reference-contexts: This is the lottery "paradox." Carnap <ref> [Car68] </ref>, discussing the possibility of inductive logic using arguments conforming to schema II, argues that while people do seem to discuss arguments in the way suggested, it is to be understood as an abbreviation or shorthand for a more adequate view of induction, which should proceed strictly according to schema II.

Reference-contexts: For Carnap there is no place for arguments conforming to schema II. This seems to be true ofCheesman, as well <ref> [Che88] </ref>. Nevertheless, there are some arguments in favor of schema II playing a role in uncertain inference. 7 Arguments in favor of schema II.

Reference-contexts: There is a sense in 6 The general idea goes back to Dewey <ref> [Dew38] </ref>, and perhaps earlier. 9 which we can say that the need is illusory. Suppose that a certain premise, say P 21 is needed for an inference of the flrst sort.

Reference-contexts: In what follows, I shall try to ensure that nothing I say depends crucially on whether we express uncertainty by means of belief functions [Sha76, SK94], or probability functions, or classes of probability functions [Lev67, Lev80], or probability envelopes [Wal91], or by fuzziness [Zad75], or by possibility measures <ref> [DP85] </ref> , or any other way. However we construe uncertainty, though, we shall want tomake a distinction between a sentence expressing that uncertainty, and the sentence whose uncertainty may be being expressed. <p> Similarly, possibility theory <ref> [DP85] </ref> seems to satisfy this condition, as does the transferrable belief model [SK94]. 6 The eliminability of schema II.

Reference-contexts: The procedures of inference may be deductive, or inductive, or involve such inferential methods as hypothesis testing. The conclusion may be of categorical form, or may be qualifled by a measure of uncertainty. These possibilities can be captured with the help of a notation suggested by Hempel <ref> [Hem61] </ref> 2 : Schema I U ncertainty-P remise 1 P remise 2 P (Conclusion) = r This represents an argument in which there are two premises, one of which expresses uncertainty (probability, belief . . . ), and in which the conclusion is a statement expressing uncertainty explicitly. 3 Example: T

Reference-contexts: According to other views, these premises represent the application of a principle such as a principle of indifierence [Lap51] or a principle of maximizing entropy over a set of answers <ref> [Jay57] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: But when we reject these premises as certainties, and seek to incorporate the evidence for them into schema I, we must worry anew about lottery problems <ref> [Kyb61] </ref>, just as we must in schema II when what we are looking for is an argument for the conjunction in question. Example: We are considering inviting John to join our Frisbee team. Practise isn't important, but native athletic ability is.

Reference-contexts: An attempt to provide a general semantics for inferences conforming to schema II has been made in [Kyb96]. Speciflcally statistical inferences have been explored in <ref> [Kyb74] </ref>: what is sought there is exactly that middle ground referred to above, in which our knowledge about uncertainty is, like other knowledge, based on objective and public data, and methods of inference that may be characterized either as yielding the truth frequently or as succumbing to error rarely. 8 Conclusion.

Reference-contexts: But this is just the question of determining "the reference class" for the application of statistical knowledge; some of us do regard that as a serious problem, but it is not one I want to address here <ref> [Kyb83] </ref>. The example illustrates a fairly uncontroversial and simple bit of Bayesian inference. We examined it in some detail because we wanted to be very clear that the inference involved is pure, mathematical, deductive, truth-preserving inference.

Reference-contexts: This is combined with the knowledge that the chance of getting type I is 0.60 and the chance of getting type II is 0.40, i.e., that the probability that 5 with a little artiflciality it is easy to get the efiect of "Jefirey conditionalization" in the classical framework <ref> [Kyb86] </ref>. 7 the selected urn u is of type I is 0.60 and that it is of type II is 0.40. These two facts represent our knowledge of uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: But there are two crucial difierences. First, the procedure of inference is no longer assumed to be deductive. Inference, on this pattern; is not necessarily truth preserving. It could be inductive inference, what I have called `probabilistic inference' in other places <ref> [Kyb88b] </ref>, statistical inference in the classical form developed by Ney-man and Pearson [Leh59], and perhaps various other forms of inference such as inference by analogy.

Reference-contexts: First, the procedure of inference is no longer assumed to be deductive. Inference, on this pattern; is not necessarily truth preserving. It could be inductive inference, what I have called `probabilistic inference' in other places [Kyb88b], statistical inference in the classical form developed by Ney-man and Pearson <ref> [Leh59] </ref>, and perhaps various other forms of inference such as inference by analogy. Recall that the "procedure of inference" may involve many steps; all that is intended by this model is that at least some of the steps may not be truth preserving. <p> Uncertain inferences with categorical conclusions appear to be what have inspired those who work with nonmonotonic logic. They correspond to certain classes of classical statistical inference | confldence intervals, hypothesis testing <ref> [Leh59] </ref>. How to deal with the non-conjunctive character of such inferences is a problem that is under investigation in a number of areas, but it is one for which no general agreed-upon solution exists.

Reference-contexts: Example 1: "The probability of heads on a toss of a coin is 0:5 ." Barring the possibly question-begging occurrences of the indeflnite article "a," this is simply a factual assertion about the behavior of coins <ref> [Rei49] </ref>. It embodies uncertainty, because one of the facts about coins is that the results of their ips are uncertain, and in fact uncertain in the way described. For most of us there is little or nothing uncertain about the statement itself.

Reference-contexts: Example 2: "Albert's degree of belief in the occurrence of heads on the next toss of this coin is 0.5." Again, this is a factual assertion about Albert; presumably about his willingness to buy and sell chances based on the outcome of the toss in question <ref> [Sav54] </ref>. There is nothing special about Albert; we may in other contexts use the possessive pronouns "your," "our," and "my." A statement like this, in the context of reasoning or decision making, is a statement embodying uncertainty | perhaps in a difierent sense from that embodied in the flrst example.

In the probabilistic 6 framework, the procedure is nothing less than classical conditionalization. 5 For belief functions it may be "Dempster conditioning" <ref> [Sha76] </ref>. For other representations of probability, the procedure may be difierent again. The point is that each representation of uncertainty has its own "updating" procedures. <p> In terms of belief functions, for example, a "high" Bel value for P 21 must be associated with a low Bel value for :P 21 , and Bel applied to an exclusive disjunction must have at least as high a value as the sum of its values for the disjuncts <ref> [Sha76] </ref>. Similarly, possibility theory [DP85] seems to satisfy this condition, as does the transferrable belief model [SK94]. 6 The eliminability of schema II.
