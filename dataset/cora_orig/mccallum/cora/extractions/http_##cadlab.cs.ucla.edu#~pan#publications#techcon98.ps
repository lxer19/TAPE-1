Abstract: In this paper, we develop a set of delay estimation models with consideration of various interconnect optimization techniques, including optimal wire-sizing (OWS), simultaneous driver and wire sizing (SDWS), and simultaneous buffer insertion/sizing and wire sizing (BISWS). These models have been tested on a wide range of parameters and shown to have about 90% accuracy on average compared with running complex optimization algorithms directly followed by HSPICE simulations. Moreover, our models run in constant time in practice. As a result, these simple, fast, yet accurate models are expected to be very useful for a wide variety of purposes, including layout-driven logic and high level synthesis, performance-driven floorplanning, and interconnect planning.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, many interconnect optimization techniques, including wire sizing, driver sizing, buffer insertion and sizing, etc., have been proposed and shown to be very effective for interconnect delay reductions (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). However, in the current VLSI design flow, interconnect optimization is usually performed at very late stages. Consequently, accurate interconnect delay, especially that for global interconnects is not known to logic/high level syntheses. Since interconnect optimization may improve interconnect performance by a factor of 5 to 6 times [1], it is <p> reductions (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). However, in the current VLSI design flow, interconnect optimization is usually performed at very late stages. Consequently, accurate interconnect delay, especially that for global interconnects is not known to logic/high level syntheses. Since interconnect optimization may improve interconnect performance by a factor of 5 to 6 times [1], it is less likely for synthesis engines to make correct decision without proper modeling of the impact of interconnect optimization. <p> Section 2 states the problem formulation and parameters used for our study. Sections 3 to 5 present the DEMs under OWS, SDWS and BISWS respectively, and compare them with HSPICE simulations after running corresponding optimization algorithms from UCLA Tree-Repeater-Interconnect-Optimization (TRIO) package <ref> [1] </ref>. Section 6 presents concluding remarks and possible applications of our models. 2 Problem Formulation and Parameters The objective of our study is to quickly and accurately estimate interconnect delays with consideration of interconnect optimization. Fig. 1 shows such an interconnect wire of length l to be considered. <p> During interconnect optimizations, a long wire may be divided into a number of wire segments. Each wire segment is modeled by a -type RC circuit and each buffer is modeled as a switch-level RC circuit <ref> [1] </ref>. The well-known Elmore delay model is used to guide the delay optimization and estimation.

Reference-contexts: They are based on the 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS'97) <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Therefore, in practice, the procedure in Fig. 5 also runs in constant time. Table 2 shows the critical lengths for some typical buffer sizes under various NTRS'97 technology generations. It is interesting to observe that: (i) As l crit decreases and chip size increases <ref> [2] </ref>, more buffers shall be inserted for performance optimization as the technology scales down.

(3) 4 Delay Estimation Model under Simultaneous Driver and Wire Sizing (SDWS) This section presents the delay estimation model under SDWS, which sizes both the wires and the driver <ref> [6] </ref>. To obtain an accurate delay estimation model, we use the OWS delay estimation model from the previous section. Note that in our problem formulation, G 0 is fixed. But the driver G can be sized optimally to achieve the best performance from available driver set D.

Reference-contexts: The delay estimation model under SDWS is outlined in Fig. 3. To solve the root k fl of dT (k)=dk = 0, we can use the efficient numerical approach such as bisection method <ref> [7] </ref>. Let * 0 be the initial range that k fl lies in and * be the error tolerance for k fl . Bisection method basically cuts the root search range by half at each iteration. So the number of iterations will be log 2 (* 0 =*). <p> The critical length computation procedure is outlined in Fig. 5. Similar to SDWS, we use very fast bisection method <ref> [7] </ref> to obtain the root for Eqn. (6). Let * 0 be the initial root range and * be the error tolerance for l crit , the root can be computed in log 2 (* 0 =*) iterations in step 2.
