Title: Enhanced Certificate Revocation System  
Author: by Silvio Micali 
Note: ROUGH DRAFT  
Affiliation: Laboratory for Computer Science MIT  
Abstract: We apply off-line digital signatures to provide a novel approach to certificate revocation. Our approach dismisses with traditional CRLs and yields public-key infrastructures that are several-hundred times cheaper to run than traditional ones. More generally, our technology also yields effective methods to lengthen the validity of a digital signature.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the CA is the signer of an off-line/on-line signature scheme in the sense of Even, Goldreich, and Micali <ref> [2] </ref>: in an off-line step, she uses a first (traditional) signature scheme to sign the public key Y within the certificate, and then, in an on-line step, she uses the second signature scheme to sign a value in the interval [1,365] in a most fast way.
