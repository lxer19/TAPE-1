Abstract: Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months, and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material, or to cite them other than as a ``working draft'' or ``work in progress.'' Abstract This document describes issues and approaches related to aggregation of QoS requests, when RSVP [BZB + 97] is the protocol used to convey such requests. Aggregation is an important component to provide scalable QoS solutions, especially in the core of the backbone where the sheer number of flows mandates some form of aggregation. However, aggregation needs to be provided without impacting the ability to provide end-to-end QoS guarantees to individual flows. In this document, we review some of the main goals of aggregation and describe possible solutions, that do not preclude support for end-to-end QoS guarantees. Those solutions are targeted at unicast flows as we expect them to represent a large fraction of the flows requesting reservation, and hence to be the main contributors to potential scalability problems with RSVP.

Reference-contexts: Support for such aggregate requests is not available from the current RSVP specifications, and would require the definition of new filter specifications. One possible example are the CIDR prefix based filters suggested in <ref> [Boy97] </ref>. The introduction of such extensions is certainly key to increasing the applicability of RSVP as a generic reservation protocol, but in this document we instead focus on the second and more immediate aspect of QoS aggregation for RSVP.

Introduction As described in <ref> [Bra97] </ref>, there are several facets to the support of QoS in the Internet. The aspect of QoS aggregation with RSVP falls primarily in the areas of ``Control Model'', and to some extent ``Scope'', as they are identified in [Bra97]. Specifically, the focus of QoS aggregation is on both the granularity of QoS guarantees, and their extent, i.e., from where to where.

Reference-contexts: While this satisfies requirement R3, it does so at the cost of potentially unnecessary penalization of RSVP flows, e.g., out-of-order delivery, even in the absence of congestion in AS2. 3.2. TOS Field Based Aggregation A number of other approaches for aggregation have been brought forward, <ref> [CW97, BV97, Hei97, Kil97] </ref>, with several [CW97, Hei97, Kil97] proposing the use of fewer bits in the IP header for classification purposes. In particular, it has been suggested to use the TOS octet field [Pos81] to specify different service classes as well as drop precedence.

Reference-contexts: In RSVP, the granularity of a QoS request is determined through filters that specify destination address and port number, as well as source address and port number in some instances (see <ref> [BZB + 97] </ref> for details). This corresponds to a very fine granularity of QoS guarantees, i.e., per flow, and while this provides end-users with accurate control, it can also translate into a substantial overhead for the network.

Reference-contexts: As a result, some mechanism is needed to identify non-conformant packet even after flows have been merged.

Reference-contexts: Processing of RSVP (PATH) messages from individual flows in the backbone can be avoided simply by hiding the information used to trigger RSVP processing, i.e., turn the router-alert option <ref> [Kat97, KAPJ97] </ref> off at the ingress router. The problem is then that without the router-alert option on, the egress router will also fail to identify, and therefore intercept and process those PATH messages. Guerin et al.

Reference-contexts: In this document, we outline only one of several alternatives. The update of the ADSPEC can be done as described before, using the ADSPEC values of the tunnel. The determination of appropriate TSpec and RSpec values for the tunnel, essentially follows the method described in <ref> [RG97] </ref>. Specifically, the TSpec used for the tunnel needs to be at least the ``sum'' of the TSpec's of the individual flows. Similarly, the reserved rate R of the RSpec is determined using eqs. (6) and (7) of [RG97], with the only difference that the individual delay bounds used in eq. <p> and RSpec values for the tunnel, essentially follows the method described in <ref> [RG97] </ref>. Specifically, the TSpec used for the tunnel needs to be at least the ``sum'' of the TSpec's of the individual flows. Similarly, the reserved rate R of the RSpec is determined using eqs. (6) and (7) of [RG97], with the only difference that the individual delay bounds used in eq. (7) are only for the portion of the flows paths that coincide with the tunnel. <p> Guerin et al. Expires 26 May 1998 [Page 8] Internet Draft Aggregating RSVP-based QoS Requests 21 November 1997 It should be pointed out that as mentioned in <ref> [RG97] </ref>, the resulting aggregate reservation rate for the tunnel can be either smaller or bigger than the sum of the individual reservation rates.

Reference-contexts: From the point of view of aggregation of RSVP flows, this means that RSVP data packets are assigned a value for the TOS field in their IP header, that is a function of both their service class, e.g., Controlled Load [Wro97a] or Guaranteed Service <ref> [SPG97] </ref>, and whether the packet is conformant or not. Specifically, several (the exact number is tbd and a function of the number of distinct service classes that are deemed necessary) TOS bits are used to specify service classes. <p> The case of a Guaranteed Service Tunnel is somewhat more involved. There are two issues that need to be addressed. The first is the update of the ADSPEC in the PATH messages of individual flows at the egress router (see <ref> [SPG97] </ref> for details on the use of ADSPEC). The second is the selection of appropriate TSpec and RSpec for the tunnel, so that the delay bounds of all individual flows can be guaranteed. The handling of these two issues are not independent, and there are many possible solutions.
