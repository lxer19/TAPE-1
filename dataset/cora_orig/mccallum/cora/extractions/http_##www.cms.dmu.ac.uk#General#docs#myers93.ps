Abstract: Everyone knows that designing and implementing human-computer interfaces is difficult and time-consuming. However, there is little discussion of why this is true. Should we expect that a new method is around the corner that will make the design easier? Will the next generation of user interface toolkits make the implementation trivial? No. This article discusses reasons why user interface design and implementation are inherently difficult tasks and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

Reference-contexts: A usability lab may cost between $70,000 and $250,000 in capital costs to set up, plus professional staff. When contracted out to a consulting firm, a single usability test may cost between $10,000 and $60,000, and when performed in house, $3000 to $5000 <ref> [Abelow 93] </ref>. Nielsen provides a survey of the costs for various techniques [Nielsen 93a], and shows that the benefits still outweigh the costs. Furthermore, there are ``discount'' usability methods that are often sufficient [Nielsen 90].

Reference-contexts: Thus, usability is a do or die decision for developers, and is being cited with increasing frequency and explicitness in product advertisements. Although American industry has invested heavily in information technology, the expected productivity improvements have not been realized <ref> [Attewell 93] </ref>. Usability at the individual, group and firm level has been cited as a culprit in this productivity paradox. For instance, the ever-changing computer environments caused by new product introductions and upgrades make continual learning demands on workers [Attewell 93]. <p> in information technology, the expected productivity improvements have not been realized <ref> [Attewell 93] </ref>. Usability at the individual, group and firm level has been cited as a culprit in this productivity paradox. For instance, the ever-changing computer environments caused by new product introductions and upgrades make continual learning demands on workers [Attewell 93]. There is substantial empirical evidence that attention to usability dramatically decreases costs and increases productivity. A model of human performance, and a corroborating empirical study, predicted that a new workstation for telephone operators would decrease productivity despite improved hardware and software.

Reference-contexts: Other studies have shown that it is important to have HCI specialists involved in design. A formal experiment reported that professional HCI designers created interfaces that had fewer errors and supported faster user execution than interfaces designed by programmers <ref> [Bailey 93] </ref>. One reason is that training and experience in HCI design has a clear impact on the designer's mental model of interfaces and of the user interface design task [Gillan 90]. <p> Therefore, it is difficult to know when to stop iterating. Furthermore, ``... [experimental] data supports the idea that changes made to improve one usability problem may introduce other usability problems'' <ref> [Bailey 93] </ref>. The same data also showed that while iterating on a poor design does improve it, iteration never gets it to be as good as an interface that was originally well-designed. Thus iterative design does not obviate the need for good designers.

Reference-contexts: Thus iterative design does not obviate the need for good designers. Another important problem is getting ``real'' users with which to test. ``Too often ... testers have to extrapolate from `problem' users who bring a set of `hidden agendas' with them to the test session'' <ref> [Ballman 93] </ref>. The actual users of a product may be different from the buyers, so it is important not to use the buyers as subjects. Participants in tests are usually self-selected, so they are likely to be more interested, motivated, and capable than the actual end users.

Reference-contexts: New regulations, such as Directive 90/270 from the Council of European Communities, are being passed that require interfaces to be ``easy to use and adaptable to the operator'' <ref> [Billingsley 93] </ref>. ACM has started two new publications about HCI: Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction and the magazine Interactions. ARPA and NSF in the United States, ESPRIT in Europe and MITI in Japan have all initiated significant HCI initiatives. 3.

Reference-contexts: This is typically the province of professional graphic designers. 3. Documentation, Messages and Help Text: One study showed that rewriting the help messages, prompts, and documentation to increase their quality had significantly more impact on the usability of a system than varying the interface style <ref> [Borenstein 85] </ref>. Thus it is important to have good technical writers participating in the design. 4. Internationalization: Many products today will be used by people who speak different languages.

Reference-contexts: interface implementation tools such as toolkits and user interface management systems (UIMSs) will start "Because user interfaces are hard to implement...." But why are human-computer interfaces so hard to design and implement, and can we expect this problem to be solved? Like software in general, there is no ``silver bullet'' <ref> [Brooks 87] </ref> to make user interface design and implementation easier.

Reference-contexts: However: instead of reducing the absolute complexity of an interface, this approach seeks to increase the familiarity of the concepts....

Reference-contexts: Surveys of software in general show that the deep application-specific knowledge required to successfully build large, complex systems is held by only a few developers, and is hard to acquire <ref> [Curtis 88] </ref>. Furthermore, Don Norman reports: My experience is that the ... initial specifications ... are usually wrong, ambiguous or incomplete. In part, this is because they are developed by people who do not understand the real problems faced by the eventual users....
