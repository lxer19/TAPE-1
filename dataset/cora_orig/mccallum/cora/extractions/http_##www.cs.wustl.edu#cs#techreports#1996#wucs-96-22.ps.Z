Abstract: In the first part of this work we present a brief survey of the literature on resource allocation processes in which communication among agents plays a relevant role. Then, taking into account the results of AI research, we present a model of negotiation with a strong emphasis on the underlying linguistic structure. We use the properties of that structure to derive the conditions that message exchanges must obey in order to provide Pareto-optimal allocations.
