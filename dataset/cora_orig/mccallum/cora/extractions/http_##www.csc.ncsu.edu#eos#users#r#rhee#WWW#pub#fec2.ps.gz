Abstract: Real-time interactive video transmission in the current Internet has mediocre quality because of high packet loss rates. Loss of packets belonging to a video frame manifests itself not only in the reduced quality of that frame but also in the propagation of that distortion to successive frames. This error propagation problem is inherent in any motion-based video codec because of the interdependence of encoded video frames. Since packet losses in the best-effort Internet environment cannot be prevented, minimizing the impact of these packet losses to the final video quality is important. In this paper, we present a new forward error correction (FEC) technique that effectively alleviates error propagation in the transmission of interactive video. The technique is based on our recently developed error recovery scheme called Recovery from Error Spread using Continuous Updates (RESCU). RESCU allows transport level recovery techniques previously known to be infeasible for interactive video transmission applications to be successfully used in such applications. The proposed FEC technique can be very useful when the feedback channel from the receiver is highly limited, or transmission delay is high. Both simulation and Internet experiments indicate that our proposed FEC technique effectively alleviates the error spread problem and is able to sustain much better video quality than H.261 or other conventional FEC schemes under various packet loss rates.

Reference-contexts: Image distortion in a reference frame can propagate to its succeeding frames and becomes amplified as more bits are lost. Most of earlier work on loss recovery focuses on repairing packet losses before the scheduled display times of those video frames contained in lost packets (e.g., <ref> [31, 28, 21, 39, 1, 36, 20, 23] </ref>). However, this approach is ineffective for interactive video because data losses inevitably occur in packet-switched communication, and detecting and repairing losses incur latency. To handle this latency, existing techniques introduce additional delays in frame display times. <p> This latency can significantly impair the interactiveness of any video applications under the current Internet. Forward error correction is also commonly proposed for error recovery of continuous media transmission <ref> [20, 1, 17, 6, 3] </ref>. However, conventional FEC schemes do not work well for interactive video. <p> Since all the coded blocks are temporally independent, packet loss affects only those frames that are contained in lost packets. FEC has been successfully applied to audio transmission [5, 3, 29, 30]. There are only a few studies on applying FEC to video transmission. Priority encoding transmission (PET) <ref> [1, 20, 36] </ref>, encodes different segments of video data with different priority. Each packet contains relatively more redundant information about the higher priority segments of the data, so the information with a higher priority can have a higher chance of correct reception.

Reference-contexts: This n packets is called as a FEC block. The RSE decoder at the receiver side can reconstruct the source data packets using any k packets out of its FEC block. Efficient (n; k) RSE encoding and decoding algorithms have been developed and implemented to achieve real-time performance <ref> [2, 15, 34, 27] </ref>. For instance, the throughput of the software coder by Rizzo [34] can achieve 11 MB/s on a 133 MHz Pentium.

Reference-contexts: Thus, burst losses happen mostly for the original periodic data packets. Since high loss rate traces have AVLs around 1 to 3, 6 FEC packets in PTDD 6 can effectively recover these losses. The short AVLs we obtained for most traces are aligned with Bolot's experiments <ref> [4] </ref> which indicate that long sustained loss bursts are rare in the Internet. In order to further study the behavior of RESCU-FEC under high burst loss environments, we ran simulation experiments. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the impact of burst losses in the performance of RESCU-FEC.

Reference-contexts: This latency can significantly impair the interactiveness of any video applications under the current Internet. Forward error correction is also commonly proposed for error recovery of continuous media transmission <ref> [20, 1, 17, 6, 3] </ref>. However, conventional FEC schemes do not work well for interactive video. <p> The PET scheme is also incorporated into vic [26] and is reported a good performance [38]. This good performance is partially due to vic's intracoding which limits error propagation caused by loss of lower priority segments. Bolot and Turletti <ref> [6] </ref> proposed an interesting FEC technique for packet video where a packet contains the redundant information of some of previous packets. The redundant information is created by encoding the image blocks contained in the previous packets with a large quantization step. <p> For instance, loss of some header information affects all the data that tagged on the header although they are received correctly. The techniques minimizes this effect. Remarks A drawback of proactive techniques is that it wastes bandwidth under error-free transmission. Furthermore, in wireless mobile networks, the assumption made in <ref> [6] </ref> does not hold as long burst losses can be common due to fading and channel interference. Thus, the FEC schemes mentioned above are susceptible to burst errors because both data and FEC-encoded packets have to be transmitted at the same frame interval.

Reference-contexts: Although error concealment techniques can be combined with error recovery techniques, they are not strictly error recovery techniques <ref> [7] </ref>, so we do not discuss them.

Reference-contexts: MPEG-4's techniques can be used along with RESCU to further reduce the effect of data loss. 4.3 Hybrid recovery Hybrid techniques combine ARQ (retransmission) and FEC for better error resilience. There are two types of hybrid techniques: type-I hybrid ARQ <ref> [8] </ref>, and type-II hybrid ARQ [22]. Type-I hybrid ARQ transmits both error detection and 19 correction data at the initial transmission of data. If the receiver cannot recover lost packets using the transmitted parity data, it requests retransmission of the same data from the sender.

Reference-contexts: Since RESCU uses FEC packets to restore buffered reference frames (called periodic frames), FEC packets can be transmitted over a relatively longer period, interleaving with the packets of other (non-periodic) frames to help reduce the effect of bursty losses. Note that this interleaving is different from link-level symbol interleaving <ref> [41, 13] </ref> where symbols from multiple codewords are interleaved. The granularity of our proposed interleaving is much larger and thus, more effective.

Reference-contexts: They claimed that if the video source is not bursty, long burst losses are rare, and the proposed scheme would work well for video. H.263+ also includes a similar technique called independent segment decoding (ISD) <ref> [18] </ref>. In the ISD mode, each video slice is encoded as an individual picture (or subvideo) independent of other slices. In particular, each slice boundary is treated just like picture boundary. ISD does not eliminate error propagation, but limits the extent of error propagation to a slice.

Reference-contexts: The reference picture selection (RPS) mode allows the encoder to select one of several previously decoded frames as a reference picture for motion estimation.

Reference-contexts: Image distortion in a reference frame can propagate to its succeeding frames and becomes amplified as more bits are lost. Most of earlier work on loss recovery focuses on repairing packet losses before the scheduled display times of those video frames contained in lost packets (e.g., <ref> [31, 28, 21, 39, 1, 36, 20, 23] </ref>). However, this approach is ineffective for interactive video because data losses inevitably occur in packet-switched communication, and detecting and repairing losses incur latency. To handle this latency, existing techniques introduce additional delays in frame display times. <p> To handle this latency, existing techniques introduce additional delays in frame display times. However, delaying frame playout times greatly impairs the interactiveness of video communication. Many researchers <ref> [31, 28, 21, 39] </ref> have proposed using retransmission of lost packets by delaying frame playout times to allow arrival of retransmitted packets before the display times of their video frames. Any packets received after their display times will be discarded. <p> Packet 3 is now used to restore the R-frame of frame 3 (frame 1), so frame 3 can be decoded and displayed without an error. This retransmission technique is fundamentally different from other retransmission schemes <ref> [31, 28, 21, 39] </ref> in that it does not introduce any delay in frame playout times. <p> Since motion prediction is always based on the frames that are received by the receiver, error propagation is effectively eliminated. Retransmission has recently attracted much attention for packet loss recovery in video transmission. Ramamurthy and Raychaudhuri <ref> [31] </ref> applied a similar technique to video transmission over ATM. They analyzed the performance of video transmission over an ATM network when both retransmission and error concealment are used to repair errors occurring from cell loss.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, since FEC is applied to a block of packets, before FEC packets are computed and transmitted, large delay must transpire. In our earlier work <ref> [32, 33] </ref>, we proposed an entirely complementary approach to the above-mentioned approaches by focusing on eliminating error propagation when distortion on displayed images happens. <p> We named this approach Recovery from Error Spread using Continuous Updates (RESCU). RESCU has been shown effective for interactive video transmission when retransmission is used to recover lost packets and round trip delays are small <ref> [32, 33] </ref>. Retransmission tends to prolong error propagation because of the delay involved in detecting and retransmitting lost packets. Moreover, in some networks such as wireless cable modems and direct satellites, feedback channels are highly contentious, and bandwidth-limited. <p> For more details, see <ref> [32, 33] </ref>. We base our discussion on H.261, an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) video standard.

Reference-contexts: This n packets is called as a FEC block. The RSE decoder at the receiver side can reconstruct the source data packets using any k packets out of its FEC block. Efficient (n; k) RSE encoding and decoding algorithms have been developed and implemented to achieve real-time performance <ref> [2, 15, 34, 27] </ref>. For instance, the throughput of the software coder by Rizzo [34] can achieve 11 MB/s on a 133 MHz Pentium. <p> Efficient (n; k) RSE encoding and decoding algorithms have been developed and implemented to achieve real-time performance [2, 15, 34, 27].

Reference-contexts: They showed that using rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes [12, 14], one or two retransmission attempts achieve a low packet error rate under a perfectly interleaved Rayleigh fading channel. Hybrid ARQ techniques were also studied in reliable multicast <ref> [35, 27] </ref>. While FEC helps reduce occurrences of independent losses, retransmission repairs correlated packet losses. They showed that hybrid ARQ reduces the bandwidth overhead of repairing packet losses in reliable multicast involving many receivers.

Priority encoding transmission (PET) <ref> [1, 20, 36] </ref>, encodes different segments of video data with different priority. Each packet contains relatively more redundant information about the higher priority segments of the data, so the information with a higher priority can have a higher chance of correct reception.

Reference-contexts: In particular, each slice boundary is treated just like picture boundary. ISD does not eliminate error propagation, but limits the extent of error propagation to a slice. MPEG-4 adopted several error resilient techniques for wireless video transmission <ref> [37] </ref>. These include resynchro-nizations strategies, data partitioning, reversible VLCs, and header extension codes. Most of these techniques focus on preventing lost data from affecting the decoding of received data. For instance, loss of some header information affects all the data that tagged on the header although they are received correctly.

Reference-contexts: Each packet contains relatively more redundant information about the higher priority segments of the data, so the information with a higher priority can have a higher chance of correct reception. The PET scheme is also incorporated into vic [26] and is reported a good performance <ref> [38] </ref>. This good performance is partially due to vic's intracoding which limits error propagation caused by loss of lower priority segments. Bolot and Turletti [6] proposed an interesting FEC technique for packet video where a packet contains the redundant information of some of previous packets.

Reference-contexts: Since RESCU uses FEC packets to restore buffered reference frames (called periodic frames), FEC packets can be transmitted over a relatively longer period, interleaving with the packets of other (non-periodic) frames to help reduce the effect of bursty losses. Note that this interleaving is different from link-level symbol interleaving <ref> [41, 13] </ref> where symbols from multiple codewords are interleaved. The granularity of our proposed interleaving is much larger and thus, more effective.
