Abstract: Known results concerning the power of randomness are qualitative, in the sense that they only show that solutions exist or can be improved if randomness is allowed. We initiate a quantitative investigation of the power of randomness, in the context of communication complexity. We prove general lower bounds on the length of the random input of parties computing a function f, depending on the number of bits communicated and the deterministic communication complexity of f. Four standard models for Communication Complexity are considered: the random input of the parties may be shared or local, and the communication may be one-way or two-way. The bounds are shown to be tight. Namely, we demonstrate functions and protocols for these functions which meet the above bounds up to a constant factor. We do this for all the models, for all values of the deterministic communication complexity, and for all possible quantities of bits exchanged. Furthermore, we use an idea of [BN] to show that it is possible to reduce the number of random bits required by any protocol, without increasing the number of bits exchanged (up to a limit depending on the advantage achieved by the protocol). fl bitnet:canetti@techunix.bitnet

Reference-contexts: Section 3 contains the lower bounds for the four models. In section 4 we present functions and protocols for these functions that demonstrate the tightness of the bounds. Finally, we use an observation of Babai and Newman <ref> [BN] </ref> to show that the number of coin-tosses used in any protocol can be reduced up to a value depend ing only on the advantage over 1 2 achieved by the protocol. 2 Preliminaries Let f : f0; 1g n fi f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g and let P 1 <p> In the shared coins models, the resulting upper bound on * is trivial. Proof outline. The proof is based on an idea of Babai and Newman <ref> [BN] </ref>. We outline the proof for the shared coins case only.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, there are at least ( 1 2 + *)2 r entries of value 1 in this row. Therefore, the probability of having chosen less than ( 1 2 + * entries of value 1 is, according to the Hoefding inequality <ref> [ES] </ref>, less than e k* 2 8 . Summing this probability over all the 2 2n rows, and requiring that the total probability is less than one, we get that k = 16n * 2 is possible.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Yao [Y2] showed that n bits of communication are needed in or 1 der to deterministically compute the identity function (ID (x; y) = 1 iff x = y), and Paturi and Simon <ref> [PS] </ref> showed a randomized protocol that uses only two bits of communication and computes ID (with probability greater than 1 2 ). <p> Clearly, m RY = 2 log n log log n + 4, r 1 RY = 0. * The following protocol is a slight modification of a protocol presented in <ref> [PS] </ref>, and will be denoted PS .

Reference-contexts: A standard method for quantifying randomization is measuring the size of the sample-space, or in other words the length of the random input. We initiate a quantitative study of randomness in a computationally simple model: Communication Complexity. The communication complexity of a function f , as defined by Yao <ref> [Y2] </ref>, measures the minimum number of bits that have to be transfered between two parties in order to compute f (x; y), when one party has x and the other has y. <p> Although for most functions randomization does not help [AFR], a tremendous gap between the two models of computation exists for some functions.

We show a shared coins, two-way protocol for P O.
