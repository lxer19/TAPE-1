Title: The Case for Graph-Structured Representations  
Author: Kathryn E. Sanders and Brian P. Kettler and James A. Hendler 
Address: College Park, MD 20742  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Maryland  
Abstract: Case-based reasoning involves reasoning from cases: specific pieces of experience, the reasoner's or another's, that can be used to solve problems. We use the term "graph-structured" for representations that (1) are capable of expressing the relations between any two objects in a case, (2) allow the set of relations used to vary from case to case, and (3) allow the set of possible relations to be expanded as necessary to describe new cases. Such representations can be implemented as, for example, semantic networks or lists of concrete propositions in some logic. We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations efficiently. We make a "case-based argument" using examples from two systems, chiron and caper, to show how a graph-structured representation supports two different kinds of case-based planning in two different domains. We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, imple mented in caper.

Reference-contexts: We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, implemented in caper. The benefits of a graph-structured representation have also been demonstrated in plexus <ref> [1] </ref>, grebe [6], arcs [26], sme [10], and cookie [21].

Reference-contexts: PARADYME, for example, is a massively parallel frame system that has been used to implement a memory for a CBR system [20]. 3 In caper, the massively parallel mechanisms of the Parka Structure Matcher are used to match a probe graph to caper's semantic network memory <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 To evaluate the average-case behavior of matching a (labelled) probe graph to a subgraph of caper's (labelled) memory graph, we have done some preliminary experiments. <p> The complexity of the underlying subgraph-matching algorithm on actual casebases is much less than the worst case complexity (exponential in the number of binary constraints). For a detailed analysis of the algorithm, see <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.2 Case Acquisition The cost of case acquisition can be high, particularly if a CBR system uses many cases. Case acquisition includes the costs of representing and indexing individual cases. The time cost of acquiring cases can be lower in systems using feature-based representations.

Reference-contexts: Balancing the need for an expressive representation with efficiency considerations, most CBR systems have used representations that fall between feature-based and graph-structured. For example, several systems include some relational information but use the same structure for each case (e.g., <ref> [4, 8] </ref>,). Graph-structured representations are more expressive, but at a significant computational cost. We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations efficiently.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we adopt the term "feature-based," used to describe these simple IR representations <ref> [5] </ref>, and use it to denote any representation that expresses facts about individual objects in a case without relating them to each other.

Reference-contexts: For hybrid representations with fixed structures, it is also linear. Using a graph-structured representation increases the computational cost of matching. If cases were represented as unlabelled graphs, matching would be the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete <ref> [11] </ref>. If the graphs had node labels and no node label ever occurred more than once in a given case, matching would be linear in the sum of the number of nodes and the number of edges.
