Abstract: Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) technology has drastically reduced the development time and deployment cost for the synthesis of nonlinear controllers for dynamic systems. As a result we have experienced an increased number of FLC applications. We will illustrate our efforts in FLC technology transfer aimed at controlling a resonant converter power supply. We will discuss the development of FLCs for a Series-Resonant Converter (SRC) and a Single-Ended Parallel Multi-Resonant Converter (SEP-MRC). We will emphasize the role of fuzzy logic in the development and deployment of these applications, and will show how to meet their stringent throughput requirements by compiling the FLC into look-up tables.

Following this concept we implemented a hardware prototype of the fuzzy controller for the SEP-MRC, which is currently under testing.

Reference-contexts: Current Solutions Many methods have been proposed to control the output voltage of the series resonant converter. These range from a simple proportional-integral controller closed around the output voltage, to elegant control methods <ref> [5, 8, 9] </ref>. The lack of a low cost, good transient response control circuit is a major obstacle in the widespread use of resonant converters. <p> Our fuzzy logic control solution has the demonstrated advantage of very good control characteristics, while still maintaining low cost and allowing for use of inexpensive sensors. An example of a control method that provides good system response is that of <ref> [5] </ref>. This method provides good transient and steady state system response, but requires many expensive high frequency sensors. It is critical to properly tune the complex multiloop system. It is not very robust with respect to device characteristics that can change with operating conditions (e.g. resonant inductor saturation).

Reference-contexts: The intrinsic difficulty of this task has spurred the development of alternative control synthesis techniques, such as Fuzzy Logic Control. 3.2.3 FLC: A Knowledge Based System View: FLCs are knowledge based controllers usually derived from a knowledge acquisition process or automatically synthesized from self-organizing control architectures <ref> [6] </ref>. These controllers typically define a nonlinear mapping from the system's state space to the control space. Thus each FLC can be visualized as a nonlinear control surface reflecting a process operator's or a product engineer's prior knowledge.
