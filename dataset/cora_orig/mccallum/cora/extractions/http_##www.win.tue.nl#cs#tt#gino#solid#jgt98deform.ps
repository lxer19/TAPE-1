Abstract: We present a scheme for exact collision detection between complex models undergoing rigid motion and deformation. The scheme relies on a hierarchical model representation using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). In recent work, AABB trees have been shown to be slower than oriented bounding box (OBB) trees. In this paper, we describe a way to speed up overlap tests between AABBs, such that for collision detection of rigid models, the difference in performance between the two representations is greatly reduced. Furthermore, we show how to quickly update an AABB tree as a model is deformed. We thus find AABB trees to be the method of choice for collision detection of complex models undergoing deformation. In fact, because they are not much slower to test, are faster to build, and use less storage than OBB trees, AABB trees might be a reasonable choice for rigid models as well.

Reference-contexts: In order to comply with the structures and motions specified in VRML <ref> [1] </ref>, SOLID allows, besides translations and rotations, also nonuniform scalings on models. Note that a nonuniform scaling is not considered a deformation, and hence, does not require refitting. However, in order to be able to use nonuniformly scaled models, some changes in the AABB overlap test are needed.

Reference-contexts: For this experiment we used Gottschalk's RAPID package <ref> [2] </ref> for the OBB tree tests. For the AABB tree tests, we used a modified RAPID, in which we removed the unnecessary matrix operations.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that for any disjoint pair of convex three-dimensional polytopes a separating axis can be found that is either orthogonal to a facet of one of the polytopes, or orthogonal to an edge from each polytope <ref> [3] </ref>. This results in 15 potential separating axes that need to be tested for a pair of oriented boxes (3 facet orientations per box plus 9 pairwise combinations of edge directions). The SAT exits as soon as a separating axis is found.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Hierarchies of bounding volumes provide a fast way to perform exact collision detection between complex models. Examples of volume types that are used for this purpose are spheres [8, 5], oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) <ref> [4] </ref>, and discrete-orientation polytopes (DOPs) [6, 12]. In this paper, we present a collision detection scheme that relies on a hierarchical model representation using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). <p> In the AABB trees as we use them, the boxes are aligned to the axes of the model's local coordinate system, thus, all the boxes in a tree have the same orientation. In recent work <ref> [4] </ref>, AABB trees have been shown to yield a worse performance than OBB trees for rigid models. In this paper, however, we present a way to speed up overlap testing between relatively oriented boxes of a pair of AABB trees. <p> Software Library for Interference Detection (SOLID) version 2.0 1 . 1 Information on how to obtain the complete C ++ source code and documentation for SOLID 2.0 is available at http://www.acm.org/jgt/papers/vanDenBergen98. 2 2 Building an AABB Tree The AABB tree that we consider is, as the OBB tree described in <ref> [4] </ref>, a binary tree. The two structures differ with respect to the freedom of placement of the bounding boxes: AABBs are aligned to the axes of the model's local coordinate system, whereas OBBs can be arbitrarily oriented. <p> Since the local coordinate systems of a pair of models may be arbitrarily oriented, we need an overlap test for relatively oriented boxes. A fast overlap test for oriented boxes is presented by Gottschalk in <ref> [4] </ref>. We will refer to this test as the separating axes test (SAT). A separating axis of two boxes is an axis for which the projections of the boxes onto the axis do not overlap. <p> the boxes that are maintained high in the tree, whereas most of the boxes that are tested are the ones that are maintained close to the leaves. 5 Performance The total cost of testing a pair of models represented by bounding volume hierarchies is expressed in the following cost function <ref> [11, 4] </ref>: T total D N b fl C b C N p fl C p , 9 (a) X-wing (b) Teapot where T total is the total cost of testing a pair of models for intersection, N b is the number of bounding volume pairs tested for overlap, C b

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is worth mentioning that for AABB trees a larger percentage of the time is used for primitive intersection tests than for OBB trees (28% vs. 5%). In this respect, it might be good idea to use the triangle intersection test presented by Moller in <ref> [7] </ref>, which is shown to be faster than the one used in RAPID.

Reference-contexts: The random orientations of the models were generated using the method described by Shoemake in <ref> [9] </ref>. The models were positioned by placing the origin of each model's local coordinate system randomly inside a cube. The probability of an intersection is tuned by changing the size of the cube.

Reference-contexts: In fact, because they are not much slower to test, are faster to build, and use less storage than OBB trees, AABB trees might be a reasonable choice for rigid models as well. In comparison to a previous algorithm for deformable models presented in <ref> [10] </ref>, the algorithm presented here is expected to perform better for deformable models that are placed in close proximity. For these cases, both algorithms show a time complexity that is roughly linear in the number of primitives.
