Reference-contexts: One of them is the exchange based economy and the other is the price based economy <ref> [1, 2, 3, 15] </ref>. In the exchange based economy, each agent is initially endowed with some amounts of the resources. They exchange resources till the marginal rate of substitution of the resources is the same for all the agents. <p> The allocation at this point is pareto optimal. A fundamental problem in distributed control mechanisms which attempt to allocate resources in an efficient manner defined by pareto efficiency <ref> [1, 2, 3, 15] </ref> or Nash equilibrium [4] is that the distributed algorithms must converge to the equilibrium point. <p> The cost C k is composed of the cost of accessing service at processor P k and cost of to and fro communication bandwidth from the job origin to P k (here k 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>). min [C k ] (5) * Service time preference (ST): Jobs prefer the element of the budget set which gives the least response time (or service time). <p> This means that a minimum charge for a VC to access a link is * &gt; 0 (in spite of excess supply). In the economy, prices are updated using a tatonement process <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. The process changes the prices of resources if there is an imbalance in the supply and demand. <p> Processors also leased resources to other processors to make profit using the revenue they earned. The distributed system consisted of N processing nodes connected via links. Each processor P i ( i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>) has rate r i at which it can process operations on local data. A link e ij connects processor P i to P j . There are M data objects denoted by D 1 ; D 2 ; :::; D M . <p> The constraint for station i is: X i j i!j = 1. P succ i is the probability of transmission success for station i, p i!j is the price of transmission between station i and j, and w i is the wealth of station i (where i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref>). The actual allocation of resources is done via a pricing scheme which changes with the demand. The price adjustment scheme is a tatonement process (described earlier). Prices are adjusted to clear the market. The allocation in equilibrium is proven to be pareto-optimal. <p> a link. find: fc fl k ; b fl such that: min U k = min f (c k ; b k ; k ) constraints: p b b k + p c c k w k (12) c k 2 [0; C]; b k 2 [0; B]; 8k 2 <ref> [1; K] </ref> The resource constraints are P k=K P k=K k=1 b k = B, where C is the link capacity, and B is the switch buffer.

Reference-contexts: Let U (:) be a utility function which maps the resource space to a real number and let x and y be two resource allocation vectors. An agent prefers x y, when U (x) &gt; U (y). Debreu <ref> [2] </ref> has shown that if the preference ordering is complete, reflexive, transitive, and continuous, then a continuous utility function can represent this preference. In a simple computer system, each allocation of CPU and memory might define a response time for an application. <p> One of them is the exchange based economy and the other is the price based economy <ref> [1, 2, 3, 15] </ref>. In the exchange based economy, each agent is initially endowed with some amounts of the resources. They exchange resources till the marginal rate of substitution of the resources is the same for all the agents. <p> The allocation at this point is pareto optimal. A fundamental problem in distributed control mechanisms which attempt to allocate resources in an efficient manner defined by pareto efficiency <ref> [1, 2, 3, 15] </ref> or Nash equilibrium [4] is that the distributed algorithms must converge to the equilibrium point. <p> Here, c k ; b k are the allocation variables (link and buffer respectively) for class k, and w k is the wealth of class k. Each traffic class k has an arrival rate k . Numerical results were obtained using the first order conditions of multi-objective optimization techniques <ref> [2, 3, 15] </ref> for a single node with maximum link capacity C = 60 units 20 (a) (b) packets (or units) per second. The buffer space is B = 50 packets (or units). Utility Surface of T C 2 versus T C 1 in logscale (b). <p> In [17], it was shown that the utility function is decreasing convex with respect to c and b. In Figure 7 (a), the pareto surfaces for three different traffic arrival rates 3 are shown for two competing traffic classes in an Edgeworth box diagram <ref> [2, 3, 15] </ref>. Pareto surface is a collection of pareto optimal points. A point (x; y) in the Edgeworth box corresponds to an allocation fx; yg to traffic class 1 (T C 1 ) and an allocation fC x; B yg to traffic class 2 (T C 2 ).

Reference-contexts: The first modeling transformation eliminates the details of the resource and captures its relevant behaviors and optimization parameters. This paper discusses two types of economic models, and their applications to modeling computer systems. One of them is a non-pricing based approach which relies on game-theoretic <ref> [4] </ref> models to design decentralized control mechanisms for allocating resources [5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 22, 21, 11, 29]. The other is a pricing based approach where consumers and suppliers interact via market mechanisms which is based on resource prices and money. <p> The allocation at this point is pareto optimal. A fundamental problem in distributed control mechanisms which attempt to allocate resources in an efficient manner defined by pareto efficiency [1, 2, 3, 15] or Nash equilibrium <ref> [4] </ref> is that the distributed algorithms must converge to the equilibrium point.

Reference-contexts: The price system ensures that a realizable allocation of resources is achieved. The performance criteria of the system as a whole is determined by some combination of the performance criteria of the individual agents. Several papers apply versions of this model to decentralized resource allocation in computer systems <ref> [16, 12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 28, 17, 23, 25] </ref>. In an economic model of a computer system, the consumers are applications such as transactions, computational jobs, file transfer applications, multimedia teleconferences, and news distribution. <p> by [13, 12, 18, 19, 20, 5, 6, 22, 21, 29] several experiments based on simulations, and theoretical work were performed to verify the convergence properties of the algorithms. 3.2 Pricing Based Approaches A different economic approach based on pricing rather than non-pricing schemes is considered by Ferguson et. al. <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10] </ref>, Kurose et. al.

[17]. <p> to resource allocation in computer systems using the case studies of load balancing and data management in distributed systems, flow control and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in Integrated Services Networks, and Multiple Access Protocols in Broadcast Packet Networks. 3.2.1 Load Balancing Economy The load balancing economy was considered in <ref> [7, 10] </ref>. In this economy, there are N processors (P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 ; P 4 ; ::::; P N ) connected via a point-to-point network. A link e ij is a connection between P i and P j . <p> case study shows that for the load balancing problem, competitive economic concepts can achieve better levels of performance when compared to non-economic algorithms. 3.2.2 Flow Control Economy The problem of allocating network bandwidth among several virtual circuits (VCs) in a packet based computer network was considered by Ferguson et. al. <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. They used preference relations to model the heterogeneous requirements of the VCs. The relations modeled the trade-offs in average packet delay and over all throughput of each VC. They presented decentralized flow control algorithms to allocate link capacity to VCs with heterogeneous service requirements. <p> The second theorem states that there is at least one equilibrium price vector. There are several examples given by Ferguson <ref> [7, 9] </ref> where many equilibrium price vectors could exist in an economy. Theorem 1 Let ~p be an equilibrium price in the flow control economy. Then, the set of allocations ~ 1 (~p); ~ 2 (~p); ~ 3 (~p); ::: ~ N (~p) is pareto-optimal and unique. <p> Then, the set of allocations ~ 1 (~p); ~ 2 (~p); ~ 3 (~p); ::: ~ N (~p) is pareto-optimal and unique. Theorem 2 There is an equilibrium price vector ~p for the flow control economy. The proofs of these two theorems are given in <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. The flow control economy was also simulated to verify if the economy converged to an equilibrium. In each simulation, the network had 50 virtual circuits and 25 links. <p> The problem of data migration and replication was formulated in an economic setting by Ferguson <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. Transactions that entered the system for service were charged by the processors for read and write access to data objects. Processors also leased resources to other processors to make profit using the revenue they earned. The distributed system consisted of N processing nodes connected via links. <p> Recently, Stonebraker et. al. [23] have looked at the problem of efficient query processing and data migration in large database systems which involve thousands of data sites (nodes). They chose an economic paradigm similar to the one described in <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref> to design a 23 distributed database system: Mariposa, which can handle several thousand data sites. They designed efficient bidding mechanisms for clients to access the data sites. This is the first known working system which is based on an economic paradigm.

The average delay function on each link is the average delay introduced by an M=M=1 type queueing model <ref> [14] </ref>. Based on this link delay function, the utility function of VC a is given by, 12 U (x) = i2P a C i S i + x i fl a S i is the supply on link i and C i is the capacity of the link i. <p> Sessions that arrive are mapped to a traffic class based on similar traffic characteristics and QoS requirements. Each session arrives with some wealth and adds its wealth to the traffic class it joins. Traffic classes have M=M=1=B <ref> [14] </ref> type queueing models ( Figure 6 shows the link model) The utility function of each traffic class is the packet loss probability in the M=M=1=B system, which is given by: U = f (c; b; ) = &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; ( 1 c ) b c )

Reference-contexts: One of them is the exchange based economy and the other is the price based economy <ref> [1, 2, 3, 15] </ref>. In the exchange based economy, each agent is initially endowed with some amounts of the resources. They exchange resources till the marginal rate of substitution of the resources is the same for all the agents. <p> The allocation at this point is pareto optimal. A fundamental problem in distributed control mechanisms which attempt to allocate resources in an efficient manner defined by pareto efficiency <ref> [1, 2, 3, 15] </ref> or Nash equilibrium [4] is that the distributed algorithms must converge to the equilibrium point. <p> This means that a minimum charge for a VC to access a link is * &gt; 0 (in spite of excess supply). In the economy, prices are updated using a tatonement process <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. The process changes the prices of resources if there is an imbalance in the supply and demand. <p> Here, c k ; b k are the allocation variables (link and buffer respectively) for class k, and w k is the wealth of class k. Each traffic class k has an arrival rate k . Numerical results were obtained using the first order conditions of multi-objective optimization techniques <ref> [2, 3, 15] </ref> for a single node with maximum link capacity C = 60 units 20 (a) (b) packets (or units) per second. The buffer space is B = 50 packets (or units). Utility Surface of T C 2 versus T C 1 in logscale (b). <p> In [17], it was shown that the utility function is decreasing convex with respect to c and b. In Figure 7 (a), the pareto surfaces for three different traffic arrival rates 3 are shown for two competing traffic classes in an Edgeworth box diagram <ref> [2, 3, 15] </ref>. Pareto surface is a collection of pareto optimal points. A point (x; y) in the Edgeworth box corresponds to an allocation fx; yg to traffic class 1 (T C 1 ) and an allocation fC x; B yg to traffic class 2 (T C 2 ).

Reference-contexts: The price system ensures that a realizable allocation of resources is achieved.

This problem is considered in Sairamesh et. al. <ref> [17] </ref>, where economic models are applied to study allocation of link capacity and network buffers to various types of applications.

In Figure 7 (a), the pareto surfaces for three different traffic arrival rates 3 are shown for two competing traffic classes in an Edgeworth box diagram [2, 3, 15]. <p> The QoS economy provided valuable insight into the pareto optimal allocations of link capacity and buffer to traffic classes at a switch. A set of these allocations provided QoS guarantees to the traffic classes. In <ref> [17] </ref>, the equilibrium prices were determined for the resources under the QoS constraints. The impact on equilibrium prices and optimal allocations due to traffic load and variability was also investigated.

Reference-contexts: Computer systems are the primary suppliers and control local resources such a CPU time, memory, cache, disks, I/O bandwidth and communication resources. Suppliers also include servers which provide specific logical services such as network file servers, yellow pages servers, name servers, news servers and recently Web servers <ref> [24] </ref>. Suppliers control access to their resources via prices, and consumers buy resources from the suppliers to satisfy their computing needs (or service requirements). Prices are adjusted by the suppliers based on the demand placed by the consumers. <p> Economic models can also be used for service provisioning in the Internet (which is always growing). Internet currently connects millions of users and hundreds of sites. Several services exist on many of these sites, notably The World Wide Web <ref> [24] </ref>, which provides access to various information sources distributed across the Internet. Many more services (example: multimedia applications) are envisioned to be supported in the Internet. To access these large number of services, agents have to share limited network bandwidth and server capacities (processing speeds).
