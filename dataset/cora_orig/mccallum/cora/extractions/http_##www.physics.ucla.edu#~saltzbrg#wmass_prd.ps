Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Precise measurements of the mass of the W boson, the mass of the top quark, and the mass and other properties of the Z boson predict the Higgs mass precisely in the framework of the Standard Model <ref> [1] </ref>. Additional measurements at values of momentum transfer much lower than the electroweak scale, such as in atomic transitions, muon decay, and deep inelastic scattering, can further constrain and test consistency [2].

Reference-contexts: Additional measurements at values of momentum transfer much lower than the electroweak scale, such as in atomic transitions, muon decay, and deep inelastic scattering, can further constrain and test consistency <ref> [2] </ref>. The measurement of the W mass is unique among these measurements in its sensitivity to charged currents at large momentum transfer. Inconsistencies among any of these measurements could indicate the existence of new phenomena at or above the electroweak scale.

Reference-contexts: An elevation view of one quarter of the CDF detector is shown in Figure 2.2. 2 Pseudorapidity () is defined as ln (tan (=2)), where is the polar angle relative to the proton-beam direction. 6 2.2.1 Tracking Detectors A four-layer silicon microstrip vertex detector (SVX) <ref> [15] </ref>, used in this analysis to provide a precision measurement of the beam axis, is located directly outside the 1.9-cm radius beryllium beampipe. The four layers of the SVX are at radii of 3.0, 4.2, 5.7, and 7.9 cm from the beamline.

Reference-contexts: The four layers of the SVX are at radii of 3.0, 4.2, 5.7, and 7.9 cm from the beamline. Outside the SVX is a set of vertex time projection chambers (VTX) <ref> [16] </ref>, which provides r-z tracking information out to a radius of 22 cm for jj &lt; 3:25. The VTX is used in this analysis for finding the event vertex, necessary for event selection, lepton track reconstruction, and the calculation of missing E T .

Reference-contexts: The VTX is used in this analysis for finding the event vertex, necessary for event selection, lepton track reconstruction, and the calculation of missing E T . Both the SVX and VTX are mounted inside the central tracking chamber (CTC) <ref> [17] </ref>, a 3.2-m long drift chamber that makes up to 84 measurements per track over a range of radius from 31.0 cm to 132.5 cm. <p> momentum scale from a direct measurement of the magnetic field, the mass values of the ! peaks, and the Z ! mass are given in the following subsection. 3.1 Track Reconstruction The CTC is a cylindrical drift chamber with 84 sampling layers, organized in 5 axial and 4 stereo "super-layers" <ref> [17] </ref>. Axial super-layers have 12 radially separated layers of sense wires, parallel to the z axis, that measure the r- position of a track. Stereo super-layers have 6 sense wire layers, with a ~ 3 ffi stereo angle, that measure a combination of rand z informa 15 16 tion. <p> m (inner layers), to be compared with ~ 120 m expected from diffusion alone, and ~ 200 m resolution expected from test chamber results. 19 3.2.2 Wire and layer alignment The individual wire positions are taken from the precision survey performed during the CTC construction, described in detail in Reference <ref> [17] </ref>. In azimuth, CTC super-layers are divided into "cells," with each axial cell consisting of twelve sense wires and each stereo cell of six. Both sense and field-shaping wires are positioned by precision guide blocks attached to each endplate.

Reference-contexts: The energies of central electrons, used in the mass measurement, are measured from the electromagnetic shower produced in the central electromagnetic calorimeter (CEM) <ref> [18] </ref>. The central calorimeter is constructed as 24 "wedges" in for each half of the detector (1:1 &lt; &lt; 0 and 0 &lt; &lt; 1:1). <p> A proportional chamber measures the electron shower position in the two transverse dimensions at a depth of ~ 6 radiation lengths in the CEM <ref> [18] </ref>. For the purposes of triggering and dataset selection, the CEM calibrations are derived from testbeam data taken during 1984-85. To compensate for scintil-lator aging, the tower gains were corrected in March 1992 using Cesium-137 gamma-ray sources. <p> Approximately 20 towers without enough inclusive electrons to be calibrated are excluded from being seed towers for at least one of the halves of data-taking period. The variations in response ("response maps") due to the position of the shower within the tower were measured in the testbeam in 1984-85 <ref> [18] </ref>. The high statistics of the inclusive electron sample allows additional adjusting of the response maps with 0.5% sensitivity. <p> The CEM resolution is parameterized by ( ffiE E (13:5 0:7)% GeV 2 E T where the first term is the "stochastic term" due mostly to fluctuations in energy response among electron showers, measured with a 50 GeV/c electron testbeam <ref> [18] </ref>. 3 In the second term, accounts for residual gain variations not corrected by the calibration procedure. <p> Comparing to the data indicates that the best constant term to use in 3 Note that accounting for scintillator deterioration, a more accurate number might be (13:70:7)% which is close enough to make no difference. The denominator uses E T because of the tower construction <ref> [18] </ref>. 59 Equation 5.1 is = (1:0 +1:0 where the central value and the uncertainties have been determined to a precision of 0:1%. The lower bound is determined by the constraint that 2 be positive.

Reference-contexts: Each wedge has 10 electromagnetic 7 towers, which use lead as the absorber, for a total of 480 CEM towers. 3 Outside the CEM is a similarly segmented hadronic calorimeter (CHA) <ref> [19] </ref>. A proportional chamber measures the electron shower position in the two transverse dimensions at a depth of ~ 6 radiation lengths in the CEM [18]. For the purposes of triggering and dataset selection, the CEM calibrations are derived from testbeam data taken during 1984-85.

Reference-contexts: Details of the calibration of the CEM are given in Section 5. The central calorimeters also measure the energy flow of particles produced in association with the W . Gas-based electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters extend this coverage to jj &lt; 4:2 <ref> [20] </ref>. In this analysis, however, the recoil energy is calculated only in the region of full azimuthal symmetry, jj &lt; 3:6. Understanding the response of these devices to the recoil from bosons is problematic as it depends on details of the flow and energy distributions of these particles. <p> sections have described the charged-lepton energy and momentum responses in detail; this section describes the reconstruction of the recoil transverse momentum, including the corrections applied to avoid biasing the transverse mass measurement. 6.1 Recoil Reconstruction The CDF detector is instrumented with sampling calorimetry used over the range jj &lt; 3:6 <ref> [20] </ref>. The region 3:6 &lt; jj &lt; 4:2 is not used since some depth coverage is removed to make room for low-beta quadrupole magnets.

Reference-contexts: Details of the calibration of the calorimeters to recoil energy are given in Sections 6 and 7. 2.2.3 Muon Detectors Four layers of drift chambers, imbedded in the wedge directly outside (in radius) of the CHA, form the central muon detection system (CMU) <ref> [21] </ref>. 3 There are actually only 478 physical CEM towers; the locations of two towers are used for the cryogenic penetrations for the magnet. 8 The CMU covers the region jj &lt; 0:6. <p> Muon tracks in the CMU are reconstructed using the drift chamber time-to-distance relationship in the transverse () direction, and charge division in the longitudinal (z) direction. Resolutions of 250 m in the drift direction and 1.2 mm in z are determined from cosmic-ray studies <ref> [21] </ref>. Clusters of hits in at least three layers are found separately in the rand r-z planes. These two sets of clusters are merged and a linear fit is performed generating three-dimensional track segments.

Reference-contexts: At Level 2, electrons from W decay can satisfy one of a number of triggers. Some require a track to be found in the r- plane by a fast hardware processor <ref> [24] </ref> in conjunction with a calorimeter cluster; others have no track requirement but require an isolated high-E T cluster. The muon Level 2 trigger requires a high p T -track that matches to a muon chamber track.

Reference-contexts: Such a modulation, if left uncorrected, would worsen the tracking resolution but would not introduce a bias in the momentum scale measurement. However, a residual modulation with would introduce a scale bias as well as worsen the resolution. The bias arises from the forward-backward charge asymmetry in W decay <ref> [25] </ref>. <p> The longitudinal momentum distribution cannot be constrained by the Z data since Z production is sensitive to different parton distributions (uu + dd is different from ud). However, the CDF measurement of the charge asymmetry in W decay <ref> [25] </ref> can be used to constrain the longitudinal momentum distribution of the W . The W -decay charge asymmetry gets larger as the longitudinal 103 offset of u k as a function of M T for the W ! e- data.

Reference-contexts: The effect contributes a 0.02% scale uncertainty, corresponding to 15 MeV/c 2 on the W mass, common to both electron and muon analyses. 3.3 CTC Scale Calibration The momentum scale of the CTC is determined by normalizing the observed J/ ! peak to the world average value <ref> [26] </ref>. The invariant mass spectrum of 60,000 muon pairs from J/ decay is shown in Figure 3.5. A list of the systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the J/ mass is given in Table 3.1. <p> The correction is determined using Monte Carlo simulation (see Figure 3.5) and is 0:56 0:20 MeV/c 2 . Uncertainty in the World Average M J= : The uncertainty in the world averaged J/ mass, 0.1 MeV/c 2 , is included <ref> [26] </ref>. Extrapolation from M J= to M W : The momentum scale is set using muons from J/ decays in which the average muon p T is ~ 3 GeV/c. The average muon p T from W decay is ~ 38 GeV/c. <p> The final fit value for the J/ mass is 3095:1 1:7 MeV/c 2 . The momentum scale needs to be corrected by a factor of 1:00056 0:00054 for the J/ mass to agree with the world average of 3096:93 0:09 <ref> [26] </ref>. This correction is applied to set the nominal CTC momentum scale for this analysis. This translates into a correction of 4545 MeV/c 2 at the W mass. 36 T for the two muons. <p> by which each of the seven background processes are simulated and the effects on the mass measurement are addressed separately for the electron and muon channels in the following subsections. 8.1.1 W ! e- backgrounds The W ! t - ! e- process is included with its measured branching fraction <ref> [26] </ref>. The effect of polarizations on the decays are included. Few W ! t - ! e- events pass the kinematic cuts. For M W = 80:5 GeV/c 2 , the final sample is estimated to contain 0.79% of its 5718 events from this process as shown in Table 8.2. <p> The combined result is M (W + ) M (W ) (combined) = +625 240 MeV/c 2 ; (9:5) Indirect tests comparing the decay rates of + and <ref> [26] </ref> are about two orders of magnitude more sensitive to this mass difference. 9.4 Ultimate Fits The ultimate fits to the electron and muon data, from which the quoted masses are taken, are fits to the transverse mass spectra of each dataset 136 width fit of the W ! e- data.

Reference-contexts: Z ! sample. 4.4 Z ! Mass Spectrum To measure the mass of the Z boson and the track momentum resolution, Z events are simulated with a leading-order generator that includes the Drell-Yan and Z contributions and a parameterization of the radiative decay, Z ! fl, from Berends and Kleiss <ref> [28] </ref>, implemented by R. G. Wagner [29]. The Z in the Monte Carlo is boosted with a transverse momentum selected from the Z ! data (see Section 7). <p> This "radiative" simulation also includes the contribution from the three-body W decay matrix element for W ! e-fl, calculated by Berends and Kleiss <ref> [28, 29] </ref>. In the simulation, the electrons and photons are stepped through the material in front of the tracking volume; the processes of electron bremsstrahlung and photon conversion as described by Tsai [32] are included. <p> The modeling of the production and measurement of Z bosons is similar to that for W bosons described in Section 7. The Z simulation includes a Z + Drell-Yan [33] matrix element and includes a parameterization of the radiative decay, Z ! eefl as described by Berends and Kleiss <ref> [28] </ref>, and implemented by R. G. Wagner [29]. The mass shift from including the Drell-Yan term is negligible; including radiative decays in the simulation shifts the mass by 140 MeV/c 2 . A summary of the uncertainties in measuring the Z mass is shown in Table 5.8. <p> The observed shifts, listed in Table 8.3, are taken as corrections to the fitted mass. The uncertainties are due to the finite number of events generated and are comparable to the kinds of shifts seen between using two different radiative generators: the Berends and Kleiss calculation <ref> [28] </ref>, and that provided by Baur and Berger [47]. The slight differences are due to the handling of the effects of lepton mass and initial state radiation. The shifts used are from the Berends and Kleiss calculation.

Invariant mass lineshapes are generated at various values of Z mass and momentum resolution, with the Z width fixed to the world average. <p> This "radiative" simulation also includes the contribution from the three-body W decay matrix element for W ! e-fl, calculated by Berends and Kleiss <ref> [28, 29] </ref>. In the simulation, the electrons and photons are stepped through the material in front of the tracking volume; the processes of electron bremsstrahlung and photon conversion as described by Tsai [32] are included. <p> The Z simulation includes a Z + Drell-Yan [33] matrix element and includes a parameterization of the radiative decay, Z ! eefl as described by Berends and Kleiss [28], and implemented by R. G. Wagner <ref> [29] </ref>. The mass shift from including the Drell-Yan term is negligible; including radiative decays in the simulation shifts the mass by 140 MeV/c 2 . A summary of the uncertainties in measuring the Z mass is shown in Table 5.8.

Reference-contexts: The fitted mass is M Z = 91020 210 (stat:) 50 (syst:) 50 (scale) MeV=c 2 : (4:1) This value is consistent with the LEP value of 91187 MeV/c 2 <ref> [30] </ref>. <p> The constant term, , is extracted from the observed width of the Z ! ee peak assuming a stochastic coefficient of 13.5%. The main contributions to this width are the intrinsic width of the Z, Z = 2489 7 MeV <ref> [30] </ref>, radiative decays (Z ! eefl), and the smearing due to CEM resolution. The fractional RMS of the peak in the interval 81 &lt; M ee &lt; 101 GeV/c 2 is (3:45 0:18)%. <p> The measured Z mass using electrons is 90880 185 (stat.) 200 (syst.) MeV/c 2 This is 1.1 standard deviations below the LEP value of 91187 7 MeV/c 2 <ref> [30] </ref>. The data and best fit are shown in Figure 5.9. The uncertainty is dominated by limited statistics and the ability to measure a non-linearity, rather than the CEM scale uncertainty. <p> The CEM scale is determined with an uncertainty that contributes a 120 MeV/c 2 uncertainty to measurement of the W mass. As a check, the extracted mass of the Z, 90880270 MeV/c 2 is compared to the value from LEP, 911877 MeV/c 2 <ref> [30] </ref>. Section 6 RECOIL MEASUREMENT As discussed in Section 2, the only kinematic quantities relevant to the W mass measurement are the transverse momentum of the charged lepton and the total transverse momentum of the recoiling hadrons. <p> Fits to properties of the Z measured at LEP <ref> [30] </ref> may allow one to infer M LEP W = 80250 100 MeV/c 2 . The left-right asymmetry of the Z boson, measured at SLAC [49], may be used to infer M SLAC W = 80790 190 MeV/c 2 .

Reference-contexts: These electrons are predominantly produced from the decays of particles containing charm or bottom quarks and from the conversion of photons into electron pairs in the material close to the beamline. The trigger selection and electron identification are similar those described in Reference <ref> [31] </ref>. An additional requirement that E T +p T c &gt;22 GeV is applied so that the E=p distributions are minimally biased by the hardware trigger thresholds of E T &gt; 8 GeV and p T &gt; 9 GeV/c. <p> For muons, the corresponding uncertainty on the W mass is 60 MeV/c 2 and is 250 MeV on the width. 7.3.5 W width The value of the W width used in the simulation is the measured value of 2063 85 MeV/c 2 <ref> [31] </ref>, which agrees well with theoretical predictions. <p> Upper: juj &lt; 5 GeV. Lower: juj &gt; 5 GeV. 134 using the mass value from the ultimate fit. Upper: juj &lt; 5 GeV. Lower: juj &gt; 5 GeV. 135 measured value of 2063 85 MeV <ref> [31] </ref> and the directly measured value of 2040 320 MeV [48]. The shift in the measured mass from the W ! e-data when the width is unconstrained rather than fixed to its expected value is 79 MeV/c 2 .

Reference-contexts: These correlations between the fitted W mass and the W asymmetry are expected since a larger W asymmetry (a larger mean W longitudinal momentum) leads to a smaller average M T , and hence a larger fitted W mass <ref> [34] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, the low-p T part of the transverse momentum spectrum of W events, from which most of the events used in this measurement are drawn, is not known at sufficient precision to understand the W transverse mass measurement.

Reference-contexts: The p W T spectrum is derived from the Z ! ee data. The p T spectrum of Z ! ee events is theoretically expected be similar to the W p T spectrum <ref> [38] </ref>. Nevertheless, the equality of the W and Z transverse momentum spectra is not assumed. The measured Z ! ee p T spectrum is corrected to account for the electron resolutions and is then used for the p W T spectrum. <p> Rather than using the previous p W T measurement or a theoretical calculation, this W mass analysis uses the similarity of the p T spectra of W and Z bosons observed in direct measurements [37, 39] and in theoretical pre dictions <ref> [38] </ref> as a starting point.

Reference-contexts: spectrum from which the W is produced enter through mis-measurements of the W recoil transverse energy, u, and, to a lesser extent, through acceptance effects. 7.2 W Production Model The simulation is based on a leading-order W generator which simulates W events using the MRS D 0 parton distribution functions <ref> [41] </ref>. The simulated W is boosted in the center-of-mass frame of the quark-antiquark pair producing the W with a transverse momentum p W T . The p W T spectrum is derived from the Z ! ee data. <p> Lower: Same as a function of juj. 105 momentum distribution broadens. This measurement is directly sensitive to those components of the PDF which influence W production at the Tevatron, and is able to distinguish among parton distributions. The MRS D 0 set <ref> [41] </ref> is chosen to be our default PDF since this is one of the PDF sets most favored by the CDF asymmetry measurement, and also by the deep inelastic scattering experiments [42].

Reference-contexts: A Z ! ee event can mimic a W ! e- event if one of the electrons is either not observed or is mis-measured, creating significant 6 E T . The low rate of these "lost Z" events allows a correction calculated from ISAJET <ref> [44] </ref> and a CDF detector simulation to be adequate. The efficiency to detect an extra stiff track falls rapidly for jj &gt; 1:4 because the electron does not traverse enough layers in the tracking volume to be reconstructed.

Reference-contexts: All decay modes of each t are included. The effect of this process on the W mass is small and is summarized in Table 8.2 and Figure 8.1. The effect of direct W -pair production is calculated using a cross section of 10 pb <ref> [45] </ref>. The contribution to the observed event rate is 0.6 events in the sample (0.01%). Top-quark pair production with a top mass of 174 GeV/c 2 and cross section of 12.6 pb [46],[14] contributes 0.2 events.

Reference-contexts: Deep-inelastic neutrino scattering measurements may be used to infer M DIS W = 80240 250 MeV/c 2 [42]. These results can be combined with other electroweak data to yield a prediction for the top quark mass.

Reference-contexts: The largest uncertainty, other than that from the momentum scale, is the effect of radiative decay. It is estimated to be 40 MeV/c 2 , which comes from the differences between the Berends and Kleiss calculation, and that provided by Baur and Berger <ref> [47] </ref>. The differences are in the handling of initial state radiation and lepton masses. The choice of structure function contributes a negligible uncertainty. The uncertainty from the choice of the p Z T spectrum is shown to be negligible for variations constrained with the measured p Z T spectrum. <p> The uncertainties are due to the finite number of events generated and are comparable to the kinds of shifts seen between using two different radiative generators: the Berends and Kleiss calculation [28], and that provided by Baur and Berger <ref> [47] </ref>. The slight differences are due to the handling of the effects of lepton mass and initial state radiation. The shifts used are from the Berends and Kleiss calculation.
