Abstract: Massively parallel multicomputers require a high-performance interconnection network. The physical channels which connect nodes in the network are the components that most commonly impose restrictions on the amount of data which can be communicated between nodes of the network. Several different schemes for maximizing the bandwidth of physical interconnection channels are examined.

Reference-contexts: As this technology matures, it may become a common method of achieving high bandwidth communication in interconnection networks. 3.3 Fiber Optics Optical fiber communication techniques have been suggested as replacements for electrical communication schemes due to the large bandwidths of fiber optic lines, which can be as high as 32THz/fiber <ref> [Agrawal 92] </ref>. While this technology is very promising to larger-area networks, its applicability to multicomputer networks is not so clear. Since the data in a computer is stored in electrical form, it must be converted into a light-wave signal by means of a modulated source. <p> Semiconductor lasers are generally used for this purpose, as they provide much faster switching times than LED's do. Unfortunately, the signalling rate of semiconductor lasers is limited to approximately 10GBits/s due to parasitic electrical effects of the modulation circuitry <ref> [Agrawal 92] </ref>, so the full bandwidth of a fiber cannot be utilized using a single bit stream. Because the fabrication of semiconductor lasers requires GaAs technology [Agrawal 92], inte-gration with routing circuitry is more difficult. <p> Unfortunately, the signalling rate of semiconductor lasers is limited to approximately 10GBits/s due to parasitic electrical effects of the modulation circuitry <ref> [Agrawal 92] </ref>, so the full bandwidth of a fiber cannot be utilized using a single bit stream.

Reference-contexts: Typical values of v for common materials range from 0.1 to 0.2 m/ns <ref> [Bakoglu 90] </ref>. If the signal being propagated by the transmission line has short rise and fall times with respect to the time of propagation, it is possible to change the signal at its source before the original value has reached the receiving end of the line.

Reference-contexts: A straightforward protocol can be used if data is sent in bounded-sized packets. In this protocol, channel ownership is transferred whenever the end of a packet is transmitted <ref> [Bolding 93] </ref>. If one half of the channel gains ownership, but does not have data to transmit, it transmits a single-word "no-op" packet to the other side, yielding ownership back to the other side. <p> Thus, by using extra wires, full utilization of the data wires can be achieved with duplex channels. 2.1.2 Simulation Results Simulations were performed to gauge the performance of simplex and duplex channels. The reported results are based on simulations of 256-node torus networks using Chaotic adaptive routing <ref> [Konstantinidou & Snyder 90, Bolding 93] </ref> with a uniform random traffic load. Throughput results are normalized to the theoretical maximum throughput constrained by the bisection bandwidth of the network. Latency figures reported do not include source queueing.

Reference-contexts: For example, conventional 5V drivers implemented in 1:2m CMOS are limited to a data rate of about 66Mbits/s <ref> [Bolding et al. 93] </ref>. By using voltage swings of 0.25V and a 0:8m process, a data rate of around 500Mbits/s should be attainable [Dennison et al. 93]. A difficulty with low-voltage signalling is its susceptibility to noise.

Messages may be any size, and there is no packetization needed.

Reference-contexts: In general, data flows without interruption behind the head of the message. Modifications to the basic scheme introduce virtual channels <ref> [Dally 92] </ref> which allow messages to yield channel resources when blocked, while still holding all buffering resources. Effective utilization of duplex channels with wormhole routing faces two hurdles. The first is that the previously described channel arbitration scheme relies on bounded-length packets.

A difficulty with low-voltage signalling is its susceptibility to noise. Even a small spike in data can corrupt a signal with such a small voltage difference between its high and low levels. <p> Also, because there are two superimposed signals on a single wire, noise introduced at either source will be added together in the resulting signal, complicating the noise problem. Experimental results in <ref> [Dennison et al. 93] </ref> have demonstrated 100Mbits/sec (each way) concurrent signalling. The complexity of the design and noise problems curtailed performance from its expected levels in this experiment.

Reference-contexts: This, in turn, results in reduced network performance due to the under-utilization of resources. Therefore, due to the complexities of using wormhole routing with duplex channels, it is not effective to mix the two techniques. However, since packet-switched routing with virtual cut-through <ref> [Kermani & Kleinrock 79] </ref> is essentially equivalent to wormhole routing for small message sizes, the remainder of this paper will focus on packet-switched routing. 2.2 Transmission Line Wave Pipelining Because the wires which form the interconnections in a network are relatively long with respect to the speed of transmission of electro-magnetic

Reference-contexts: It is not currently clear which will scheme will achieve the highest bandwidth for a given technology. 3.2 Concurrent Full-Duplex Signalling A novel scheme which allows signals to travel concurrently in opposite directions on a single wire is presented in <ref> [Lam et al. 90] </ref>. This scheme relies on the superposition principle of electro-magnetic waves: two signals sent through the same wire will generate a wave in the wire which is the sum of the original signals.

Reference-contexts: Differential signalling, where each signal is transmitted on two wires: one for a reference voltage and the other for the actual signal, can overcome this problem. A system using 0.5V differential signalling and a 1:2m CMOS process was demonstrated to achieve a data rate of 1.2Gbits/sec <ref> [Svensson & Yuan 93] </ref>. Because differential signalling systems require two wires for every signal, though, their bandwidth must be twice that of conventional single-wire system in order to achieve the same effective bandwidth per wire. <p> The expense and area requirements of the multiple lasers needed for a routing chip are considerably greater than for the equivalent bandwidth using electrical signalling. For instance, differential signalling using 1:2m CMOS has been demonstrated to run at speeds of 1.2GBits/s <ref> [Svensson & Yuan 93] </ref>, corresponding to 0.6Gbits/s/wire.

Reference-contexts: Because duplex channels require low latency across the channel, their use becomes impractical after a certain point. If latency across a channel is reasonably small (1 - 2 cycles), duplex channels will still be of benefit, especially if arbitration can be done after long intervals <ref> [Wille 92] </ref>. As the latency across a channel grows, duplex channels quickly loose their advantage. Thus, the benefits of duplex channels will depend on the ability to design systems with short channels, especially as channel data rates increase.
