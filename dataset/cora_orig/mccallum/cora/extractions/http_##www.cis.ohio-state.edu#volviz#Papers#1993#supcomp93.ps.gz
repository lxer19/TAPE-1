Abstract: Rendering volumes represented as a 3D grid of voxels requires an overwhelming amount of processing power. In this paper we investigate efficient techniques for rendering semi-transparent volumes on vector and parallel processors. Parallelism inherent in a regular grid is obtained by decomposing the volume into geometric primitives called beams, slices and slabs of voxels. By using the adjacency properties of voxels in beams and slices, efficient incremental transformation schemes are developed. The slab decomposition of the volume allows the implementation of an efficient parallel feed-forward renderer which includes the splatting technique for image reconstruction and a back-to-front method for creating images. We report the implementation of this feed-forward volume renderer on a hierarchical shared memory machine with individual pipe-lined processors. Representation by spatial-occupancy enumeration methods allows a simple yet versatile method for the generation and display of three-dimensional objects. The most common spatial enumeration is obtained when a solid is decomposed into identical cells called voxels which are arranged in a fixed, regular, rectilinear grid. To ascribe visual properties, spatial occupancy functions and colors are assigned to voxels. Binary voxel [9] and variable-density voxel techniques ([2], [11],[12]) arise from the use of binary and continuous spatial occupancy functions, respectively. mine all the voxels of a volume which affect a given pixel on the screen. Hybrid methods exist in which the volume is traversed in both object and image order. Westover [24] employs the synonymous terms feed-forward and backward-feed for object and image order methods, respectively. We shall also use these terms to classify volume rendering methods. Feed-forward methods are also called projective or element tossing methods. The viewing transformation matrix is applied to all voxels enumerated in some order, thus providing an intermediate volume which is then projected onto a two dimensional screen. Feed-forward methods are easy to implement. However, such a direct application of the transformation matrix causes the appearance of holes (ab-sence of voxels) or doublings (presence of multiple voxels) in pixels of the image. Reconstruction in three-dimensions can be performed to annul the effect of these artifacts. Han-rahan proposed a method of decomposing the transformation matrix into a series of lower dimensional shears [8]. Such a decomposition would allow for the easier supersam-pling operation along a single dimension [19]. Splatting [24] is another reconstruction technique employed to reduce the impact of holing and doubling artifacts. Hidden volume elimination is used to determine the visibility order of the voxels. Several standard methods used for hidden surface elimination can be employed fruitfully. Z-buffer and front-to-back [18] and back-to-front [5] methods have been commonly employed, while the A-buffer [3] method has been used for rendering gaseous volumes.

Reference-contexts: The order of enumeration is usually determined by visibility considerations and is described in a following paragraph. Transformation of a voxel is effected by multiplying its coordinate vector with the transformation matrix.

In [14] and [15] ray-casting is used, while in [19] our template-based ray-casting [26] was implemented. Others, including <ref> [1] </ref>, [19], and [27] adopted a feed-forward method, wherein the multiple shear decomposition was implemented. Elvinss feed-forward method, on the other hand, included splatting as the reconstruction method of choice [4]. <p> If the grid lines are regularly spaced in all dimensions then the voxels form cubes. We denote a object space grid point P by a four-tuple <ref> [P x , P y , P z , 1] </ref> in the homogenous four-dimensional space XYZ1 of resolution n. <p> The image space is denoted by UVW1 and the coordinates for the same voxel in image space is represented by the four-tuple <ref> [P u , P v , P w , 1] </ref>. We now define some geometrical primitives which can be used as the units of computation on vector and parallel processors. A beam is the set of grid points with two of the three coordinates being fixed.

Westovers parallel implementation was not motivated by the geometry of the volume. Although, he did use incremental transformation of volumes there was no mention about the benefits of conducting incremental computations on vector and parallel processors. <p> Finally, no timings were provided. We feel that the implementation may not have provided small rendering times given the high latency of the ethernet-based network used. Elvins has also implemented a similar feed-forward renderer with splatting on a nCube <ref> [4] </ref>. However this implementation suffers from several drawbacks and is very slow. Elvinss parallel implementation was also not motivated by the geometry of the volume and did not employ any incremental methods. His implementation gave rise to a large amount of communication and was not scalable.

Reference-contexts: Real-time generation of intermediate quality images for most volumes severely taxes the capabilities of most sequential computers. It is therefore obvious that achieving real-time interaction with volumes calls for parallel processing. One option, which lacks generality, is based on special-purpose architectures <ref> [10] </ref>. Alternatively, increasingly available general-purpose parallel processors could be employed to reduce the total volume rendering time. In this paper we report the implementation of a parallel feed-forward renderer, which has been incorporated in the Denga system of renderers [21].

Reference-contexts: To get realistic images, shading is necessary. Shading requires the determination of the normal in either space. The normal can either be computed analytically for geometrical objects (spheres, cones, etc.) or estimated by using gray-level gradient schemes <ref> [16] </ref>. Reconstruction is achieved by splatting each voxel onto a two-dimensional image plane. Splatting requires the projection of a voxel onto a two-dimensional image plane of size m 2 , where m is the screen dimension.

Reference-contexts: Holes are not created in images rendered by backward-feed methods. However, some reconstruction is still needed to remove the effects of aliasing and is usually achieved through supersampling techniques. Backward-feed methods, although simple to describe, require sophisticated techniques for efficient im-plementation <ref> [26] </ref>. Efficient Feed-Forward Volume Rendering Techniques for Vector and Parallel Processors Raghu K. Machiraju and Roni Yagel Department of Computer and Information Science The Ohio State University Hybrid methods have been investigated and reported ([22], [25]). These methods can combine the advantages of both the forward and backward methods. <p> The viewing algorithms adopted in the afore-mentioned implementations are many and varied. Several are based on backward-fed methods. In [14] and [15] ray-casting is used, while in [19] our template-based ray-casting <ref> [26] </ref> was implemented. Others, including [1], [19], and [27] adopted a feed-forward method, wherein the multiple shear decomposition was implemented. Elvinss feed-forward method, on the other hand, included splatting as the reconstruction method of choice [4].
