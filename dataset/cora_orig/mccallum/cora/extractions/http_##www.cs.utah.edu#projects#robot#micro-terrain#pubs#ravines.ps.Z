Abstract: Current methods for generating terrain databases do a poor job of integrating drainage features into the terrain skin, and in arid areas leave out features such as ravines and dry washes altogether. This paper demonstrates a way to automatically extract ravines using a combination of hydrological analysis and image understanding techniques. A physically realistic hydrological analysis is run on 30-meter DEM data to generate initial estimates of ravine locations, which are then fine-tuned by an active contour (snake) method. The approach builds on standard tools, rather than being implemented as a standalone system.

Reference-contexts: representation of snakes (e.g., [ Menet et al., 1990, Wang et al., 1996 ] ), formulation of energy functions (e.g., [ Radeva et al., 1995, Lai and Chin, 1993 ] ), imposing constraints (e.g., [ Neuenschwander et al., 1995, Fua and Brechbuehler, 1995 ] ),and the method of solution (e.g., <ref> [ Wang et al., 1996, Amini et al., 1990 ] </ref> ). 3 Approach In our research, we begin with a hydrological analysis of a DEM to form estimates of ravine locations, and then use active contours to attach to the true location of the ravines. <p> and streamline to run a physically realistic hydrological analysis on the 10m interpolated data, in order to obtain our estimates for the location of the ravines. 3.2 Active Contours We use polyline (as opposed to B-spline) snakes, solving the energy equations using the discrete dynamic programming method introduced by Amini <ref> [ Amini et al., 1990 ] </ref> . <p> In this method, local minima are bypassed in favor of the global minimum for the snake, and the snake is guaranteed to converge to a final solution (a position in which it can not be modified and attain a lower energy) within a finite number of iterations <ref> [ Amini et al., 1990 ] </ref> . The hydrological analysis provides the initial estimate for the polyline snakes. The external energy function is created using a potential function approach based on edge elements computed from the aerial imagery, rather than using image gradients directly.

Reference-contexts: Those cells that accumulate drainage above a certain threshold are considered part of the drainage network. 2.2 Active Contours for Image Analysis The original paper on active contours (or snakes) was in 1988 by Kass, Witkin, and Terzopoulos <ref> [ Kass et al., 1988 ] </ref> . In it, snakes are introduced as energy-minimizing splines, whose energy is a weighted sum of internal and external energies. <p> This equation can be specified to favor various image properties, such as edges and lines.

Reference-contexts: There are two different internal energies which may be weighted in order to force a snake to act more like a membrane or string, in the sense of it resisting stretching, or more like a thin-plate or rod, in that it resists bending <ref> [ Leymarie and Levine, 1993 ] </ref> . The external energy equation is a function of the image on which it is acting. This equation can be specified to favor various image properties, such as edges and lines.
