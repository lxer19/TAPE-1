Reference-contexts: It is also difficult to accurately assess the homonymy rate in a given language as that depends on how one decides when two senses differ. The homonymy rate of 1.68 senses per word was chosen for the experiments presented here since the WordNet database <ref> (Beckwith et al. 1991) </ref> exhibits a homonymy rate of 1.68. Another series of experiments was run to determine the sensitivity of the algorithm to the various corpus construction parameters.

Reference-contexts: Finally, many words are homonymous; they can have several different senses. Children must determine which sense of each word is being used at a given time. Each of these difficulties is examined in greater detail below. Multi-word Utterances A common conjecture, dating as far back as St. Augustine <ref> (Bruner 1983) </ref> and Locke (1690), is that children hear single-word utterances in a context where the meanings of those words are made clear by ostention. If this were true, lexical acquisition would be trivial to explain. Children would simply be presented with the lexicon as input.

Reference-contexts: Siskind by the perceptual/conceptual faculty, and by the apple-to-apple mapping induced by the lexical acquisition faculty. In this view, lexical acquisition is simply a process of learning the mapping between two pre-existing mental representation languages <ref> (Fodor 1975) </ref>. It is conceivable that children do not adopt such a strict partitioning between the speech perception and perceptual/conceptual faculties on one hand and the lexical acquisition faculty on the other.

Reference-contexts: This stricter condition would make the semantic interpretation rule `linear' in the sense of linear logic <ref> (Girard 1987) </ref>. Tishby and Gorin (1994) adopt such a linear semantic interpretation rule. A linear semantic interpretation rule cannot copy information from a word or phrase so that the information appears more than once in the resulting utterance meaning.

Reference-contexts: Bootstrapping Numerous researchers have proposed strategies for how children might make use of word-to-meaning mappings to guide the acquisition of syntax <ref> (Grimshaw 1979, 1981, Pinker 1984, 1989) </ref>, or how they might use syntax to guide the acquisition of word-to-meaning mappings (Gleitman 1990, Fisher et al. 1994).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the lexical acquisition faculty might use limited semantic content, say, to distinguish between basic level and sub- or super-ordinate categories to prefer mappings to conceptual symbols representing basic level categories <ref> (Horton and Markman 1980) </ref>. The learning algorithm to be discussed, however, makes no use of the phonology of the word symbols or the semantic truth conditions of the conceptual expressions themselves. As far as it is concerned, these expressions are simply strings of uninterpreted symbols.

Reference-contexts: The word and conceptual symbols that pass between the two might not be totally devoid of phonological and semantic content. The lexical acquisition faculty might use limited phonological content, say, to distinguish nouns from verbs <ref> (Kelly 1992) </ref>, and accordingly bias words to map to objects versus events, thus using canonical structure realizations in a reverse fashion to that proposed by Grimshaw (1979, 1981) and Pinker (1984).

Reference-contexts: As normally viewed, the version-space algorithm generalizes the lower bound on the basis of observed positive instances of a class and specializes the upper bound on the basis of observed negative instances. It is generally believed, however, that children rarely, if ever, receive negative evidence of any linguistic phenomena <ref> (Lasnik 1989, Marcus 1993) </ref>. In the particular case of learning word meanings, this means that children might be told or shown examples of what a word like bicycle means, but they are never told or shown examples of what bicycle does not mean.

Reference-contexts: If this were true, lexical acquisition would be trivial to explain. Children would simply be presented with the lexicon as input. An examination of the corpus of adult speech to Nina (Sup-pes 1974) in the CHILDES database <ref> (MacWhinney and Snow 1985) </ref>, however, gives evidence that children receive insufficient input data in the form of single-word utterances to account for lexical acquisition. <p> measured the MLU of speech to children and the quantity of speech heard by children per unit time. (See, for example, Schachter et al. 1976, Snow 1977, Kaye 1980, Moerk 1983, and Wells 1986.) Furthermore, Bernstein-Ratner (p.c.) provided me with an unpublished analysis of her corpus in the CHILDES database <ref> (MacWhinney and Snow 1985) </ref>. These studies measured mostly short sample periods. Additionally Wagner (1985) measured the quantity of speech produced by children over fairly long sample periods. Table 1 normalizes these results to utterances per hour assuming an MLU of 4 to normalize Wagner's data.

Third, children must start this task without any prior language-specific knowledge. This is sometimes referred to as the bootstrapping problem <ref> (Pinker 1984, Gleit-man 1990) </ref>. Fourth, the input is noisy; it contains ungrammatical utterances and other forms of disfluencies. Children must determine which parts of the input to ignore. Finally, many words are homonymous; they can have several different senses.

Reference-contexts: Thus serious understanding of conceptual representation, and how it is grounded in perception, lies on the critical path to understanding language acquisition. This realization has motivated my own research <ref> (Siskind 1992, 1993a) </ref>, as well as that of others like Feldman et al. (1990), Suppes et al. (1991), and Torrance (1994), to study language acquisition computationally in the context of perception and action, and to focus on the requisite conceptual representations involved.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, it appears that the simultaneous approach is computationally much more expensive than a cascaded one. The approach taken in subsequent work <ref> (Siskind 1993b, 1993c) </ref>, and in this paper, of acquiring word-to-meaning mappings alone, without use of syntactic constraints, has scaled up to handle lexical acquisition problems 10,000 times larger than those solvable by the prior techniques. This gives some credence to the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis.
