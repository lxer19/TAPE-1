Abstract: We approach the problem of stock selection from the perspective of knowledge discovery in databases: given a database of several years of quarterly information on over a thousand companies, discover patterns in the data that will allow one to predict which stocks are likely to have exceptional returns in the future. The database includes measures of trends in the stocks' prices as well as fundamental data on the companies. For this task we employed the Recon system, which is able to induce a set of classification rules or a neural network to model the data it is given. To evaluate Recon's performance in the stock selection task, we paper-traded a portfolio of the fifty stocks ranked highest by Recon. When trading costs were taken into account, Recon's portfolio had a total return of 238% over a four-year period, significantly outperforming the benchmark, which returned 93.5% over the same period. The performance is not attributable to growth/value or size effects alone. We conclude that Recon is a valuable tool for stock selection. In Y. Abu-Mostafa, J. Moody, P. Refenes, and A.

Reference-contexts: Levin (1995) presents a study very similar to ours, using neural networks instead of rule induction to form a portfolio. In Levin's work, a portfolio optimizer was used to limit exposure to undesired factors and to contain turnover. Levin also used zero-investment strategy portfolios <ref> (Jacobs & Levy 1993) </ref>, which can be designed to have effectively zero exposure to certain kinds of risk by holding long and short positions. This would be an intriguing addition to our method. 6 Conclusion Any modeling tool used for stock selection should produce a comprehensible model.

Reference-contexts: The mean quarterly excess return over the benchmark for Recon was 3.47%. Recon's standard deviation was 11.8 versus 6.2 for the benchmark, so its portfolio was more volatile|were the excess returns worth the increased volatility? The Sharpe ratio <ref> (Sharpe 1994) </ref> for the Recon portfolio was 5.48, versus 1.85 for the benchmark (assuming a risk-free rate of 5.89% per annum, the average Treasury bill rate during the period).

Reference-contexts: Compared with the appropriate benchmark, Recon's portfolio generates a cumulative return of 238%, while the benchmark returns 93.5%. The key question in determining a benchmark is "If I didn't use this manager [Recon, in this case], what would I do?" <ref> (Sharpe 1995) </ref>. We obtained the data through an analysis contract with an equity management company, and were not given a description of the screening process used in creating the database. <p> The figure shows clearly that the portfolio of 50 stocks represented a good tradeoff of expected return and risk. (Of course, risk tolerance is ultimately a personal choice.) Over the out-of-sample period, the Recon portfolio had a Beta of 1.56 and Alpha of 1.24 <ref> (Sharpe, Alexander & Bailey 1995) </ref>. This means that the portfolio varied more widely than the benchmark, but also generated higher return.

If Recon's performance is attributable solely to one of these factors, then it has only discovered previously-known patterns. We will show that this is not the case.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we discuss our use of the Recon rule induction system <ref> (Simoudis, Livezy & Kerber 1994, Kerber, Livezey & Simoudis 1995) </ref> to find patterns expressed as understandable if-then rules, and the use of these rules to form portfolios of high-return stocks. <p> We perform traditional analyses of the Recon portfolio and also show how the style of the portfolio varied over time in Section 4. Section 5 discusses related work, and Section 6 presents our conclusions drawn from this experience with Recon and stock selection. 2 The Recon System Recon <ref> (Simoudis et al. 1994, Kerber et al. 1995) </ref> is an integrated system for the exploration and analysis of large databases.

Reference-contexts: Related and Future Work Much of the related work applying neural nets and other nonlinear modeling techniques to the capital markets has focused on a single asset (usually an index or derivative thereof), studying methods for using relatively high frequency timeseries data to predict future prices and generate trading signals <ref> (Trippi & DeSieno 1992, Hutchinson, Lo & Poggio 1994) </ref>. Levin (1995) presents a study very similar to ours, using neural networks instead of rule induction to form a portfolio.
