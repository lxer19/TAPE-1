Reference-contexts: We perform a topological sort on the inverse graph to impose an order on the regions of the planar subdivision. A topological sort can be implemented as a variation of the breadth first search algorithm and runs in time O (n). Refer to <ref> [3] </ref> for further details of the topological sort. Next we asociate the regions in the plane with the leaves of the binary tree, in the order produced by the topological sort.
