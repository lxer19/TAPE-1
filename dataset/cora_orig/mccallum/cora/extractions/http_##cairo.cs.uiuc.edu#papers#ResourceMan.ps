Abstract: The objective of error-free multimedia processing and communication it to manipulate and transmit media under time constraints by providing guaranteed services such as the colloquial telephone. Hence, the control-management level of the host and underlying network architectures has become a key issue of any distributed multimedia system. This paper discusses `resource management' at the host and network level, and their cooperation to achieve global guaranteed transmission and presentation services, which means end-to-end guarantees. The emphasis is on `host resources' (e.g., CPU processing time) and `network resources' (e.g., bandwidth, buffer space) which need to be controlled in order to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements set by users of a networked multimedia system. The control of the specified resources involves three actions: (1) to properly allocate resources (end-to-end) during the multimedia call establishment, so that traffic may flow according to the QoS specification; (2) to control resource allocation during the multimedia data transmission; (3) to adapt to changes when degradation of a system components' capacity occurs. These actions imply the necessity of: (a) new services, such as admission control, at the hosts and intermediate network nodes; (b) new protocols for establishing connections which satisfy QoS requirements along the path from sender to receiver(s), such as a resource reservation protocol; (c) new mechanisms for delay, rate, and error control; (d) new resource monitoring protocols for reporting system changes; (e) new adaptive schemes for dynamic resource allocation to respond to system changes; and (f) new architectures in the hosts and switches to accommodate the resource management entities.

Reference-contexts: Layering can be also found in compression and storage of data. Examples are the MPEG system's seven layers, or the data stored in a CD-ROM/XA format <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence, we encounter similar layering principles at various system components that should make use of the same techniques as described for communication protocols. (3) Different layers of the communication system may have different protocol data unit sizes. <p> With the expected services specific parameters can be connected. For example, the interstream synchronization can be defined through an `acceptable skew' relative to another stream or virtual clock <ref> [1] </ref>. The network QoS parameters describe requirements on network services. <p> Multimedia applications rely on discrete media as much as on continuous media. Therefore, not all resources should be occupied by real-time tasks and their management. There are several scheduling algorithms which are suitable for scheduling multimedia tasks <ref> [1] </ref>, but we reduce the discussion to the most relevant: * Earliest Deadline First Algorithm (EDF) The scheduler selects among tasks that are (1) ready and (2) not fully processed but with the earliest deadline. EDF produces a valid schedule whenever one exists. <p> protocols [6].

(4) The UC Berkeley's Tenet Protocol Suite provides network QoS negotiation, reservation, and resource administration through the Real-Time Channel Administration Protocol (RCAP) [8].

(7) Currently, widely used protocols for networked multimedia applications are application protocols for audio VAT and for video NV on top of Internet protocol suite UDP/IP <ref> [1] </ref>. Resource management, based on QoS requirements, has become an important part of multimedia communication systems across all system components because of the requests for resource guarantees.

Reference-contexts: for the application services possibly specified in terms of (1) media quality which includes the media source/sink characteristics, such as media data unit rate, and their transmission characteristics, such as end-to-end delay, and (2) media relations that specify the relations among media, such as media conversion, or inter/intra stream synchronization <ref> [2] </ref>. 5 The system QoS parameters describe requirements on the communication services and operating system services resulting from the application QoS. They are specified in terms of quantitative and qualitative criteria. <p> An important property of the translation service is that it must be bidirectional <ref> [2] </ref>. This requirement can cause problems because the translation mappings may be ambiguous. For example, consider video rate and video frame size application parameters. They together specify the throughput value for the network. <p> QoS Broker relies on the underlying network resource management <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The resources are reserved from the receiver to the sender and allocated from the sender to the receiver. It is assumed that a sender has sent a `path' control message before, providing information about outgoing data <ref> [4] </ref>. The reservation style refines the reservation protocol with respect to the communication scenarios and timing of reservation request: Possible communication scenarios are (1) Single Sender/Single Receiver, (2) Single Sender/Multiple Receivers, or (3) Multiple Senders/Multiple Receivers. <p> The style for sender-initiated reservation may be either that the sender creates a single reservation along the link to the receiver, or the sender creates a multicast reservation to several targets. The reservation style for receiver-initiated reservation is defined as follows <ref> [4] </ref>: (1) wildcard-filter style a receiver creates a single reservation, or resource `pipe', along each link, shared among all senders for the given session. (2) fixed filter style each receiver selects the particular sender whose data packets it wants to receive. (3) dynamic filter style each receiver creates N distinct reservations <p> continuous-media exchange with QoS guarantees, upcall structure, resource management and real-time mechanisms [1].

This means that proper services and protocols in the end-points and the underlying network architectures have to be provided.

Reference-contexts: There are several variations of negotiation among the service users (caller/callee) and the service provider <ref> [6] </ref>, where the most significant are: * Bilateral Peer-to-Peer Negotiation This type of negotiation takes place between the two service users (caller/callee), and the service provider is not allowed to modify the value proposed by the service user (Figure 6). * Bilateral Layer-To-Layer Negotiation This type of negotiation takes place only <p> We enumerate only few examples: (1) The OSI architecture provides QoS in the network layer and some enhancements in the transport layer.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we briefly outline some appropriate preventive error correction schemes to be considered in NMSs <ref> [7] </ref>: * Forward Error Correction (FEC) 19 In this mechanism the sender adds additional (redundant) information to the original data so that the receiver can locate and correct bits or bit sequences.

Reference-contexts: The advanced reservation service is essential in multi-party multimedia applications. There are two possible approaches to the advanced reservation: (1) a centralized approach where an advanced reservation server exists, and (2) a distributed approach where each node on the channel's path `remembers' the reservations <ref> [8] </ref>. 13 3.4 Resource Deallocation After the transmission of media data, resources are deallocated, which means, the CPU, network bandwidth, buffer space must be freed and the connections through which the media flow have to be closed down. <p> If load balancing can be attempted, the routing mechanism provides an alternative route and the transition from the primary route to the alternative route is accomplished using the dynamic re-routing mechanism <ref> [8] </ref>. An alternative approach is to adapt the source rate according to the currently available network resources (source adaptation). This approach requires feedback information from the network to the source which results in graceful degradation in the media quality during periods of congestion. <p> ATM-based networks [3].

Reference-contexts: This leads to a bottleneck because physically copying data is expensive. Hence, other protocol processing with virtual copying mechanisms has to be used. An example of an alternative protocol processing approach is Integrated Layer Processing, which uses the concept of Application Level Framing <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> If QoS parameter values are specified with either deterministic or statistical bounds, they require guaranteed services [11]. If QoS parameter values are estimated from past behavior of a service, they require predictive services <ref> [9] </ref>. If no QoS parameters are specified, best-effort services are employed. Services in a NMS need resources to perform their functions for manipulating data. Each resource has a set of distinguishing characteristics: * There are active and passive resources. <p> This provides the minimum and maximum delay guarantees. Some other disciplines, suitable for providing guaranteed services, are schemes such as the weighted version of the Fair Queuing (WFQ) algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>. In WFQ, each packet is stamped with a time-stamp as it arrives and then transmitted in increasing order of the time-stamps.

Reference-contexts: To each packet a virtual transmission time is allocated. It is the time at which the packet would have been transmitted, if the service provider would actually be doing Time Division Multiplexing <ref> [10] </ref>. * Delay Earliest-Due-Date (Delay EDD) The Delay EDD [11] is an extension of Earliest Deadline First scheduling where the service provider works according to a service contract negotiated with each source.

Reference-contexts: They can be specified in terms of: (1) network load, describing requirements on the ongoing network traffic, such as inter-arrival time; or (2) network performance, describing requirements which the network services have to guarantee, such as latency, bandwidth or jitter (the variance in delay across many packets) <ref> [11] </ref>. It is important to point out that network services depend on a traffic model (arrival of connection requests) and perform according to traffic parameters such as peak data rate or burst length. Hence, calculated traffic parameters are dependent on network QoS parameters and specified in a traffic contract. <p> The device QoS parameters typically specify timing and throughput demands for media data units. * Parameter values determine the types of service. If QoS parameter values are specified with either deterministic or statistical bounds, they require guaranteed services <ref> [11] </ref>. If QoS parameter values are estimated from past behavior of a service, they require predictive services [9]. If no QoS parameters are specified, best-effort services are employed. Services in a NMS need resources to perform their functions for manipulating data. <p> To each packet a virtual transmission time is allocated. It is the time at which the packet would have been transmitted, if the service provider would actually be doing Time Division Multiplexing [10]. * Delay Earliest-Due-Date (Delay EDD) The Delay EDD <ref> [11] </ref> is an extension of Earliest Deadline First scheduling where the service provider works according to a service contract negotiated with each source. The contract states that if a source obeys a peak and average sending rate, then the service provider provides bounded delay. <p> This actually is the expected arrival time added to the delay bound at the switch. By reserving bandwidth at the peak rate, Delay-EDD can assure each connection a guaranteed delay bound. * Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (Jitter-EDD) 17 Jitter EDD <ref> [11] </ref> extends Delay-EDD to provide jitter bounds. After a packet has been served by each switch, it is stamped with the difference between its deadline and actual finishing time.
