Abstract: This paper introduces the work of the Advanced Interfaces Group at the University of Manchester, which is applying recent innovations in the field of human-computer interaction to important real-world applications, whose present human-computer interfaces are difficult and unnatural. We begin with an analysis of the problems of existing interfaces, and present an overview of our proposed solution AVIARY, the generic, hierarchical, extensible virtual world model. We describe a users' conceptual model for AVIARY, implementation strategies for software and hardware, and the ap plication of the model to specific real-world problems.

Reference-contexts: We offer two particular examples which illustrate this situation. The first concerns the problems of three-dimensional design. 3D graphics has been researched and used for thirty years see, for example Tim Johnson's paper of 1963 <ref> [1] </ref> and efforts have continued to improve the interfaces for 3D display and direct manipulation [2, 3].

Reference-contexts: Much of this has been hampered * Author for correspondence, ajw@cs.man.ac.uk 1 by the central problem of interacting with a supposedly 3D world through a flat display screen. An exception to this was the pioneering work by Sutherland on head-mounted displays <ref> [4] </ref>, which was technologically too far ahead of its time to find general acceptance. During the same period there have been very big improvements in the computer's capabilities for storing and manipulating precise geometric descriptions of 3D designs, of which solid modelling systems are but one example.

Reference-contexts: For example, we can reach out and grasp a telephone almost without looking at it because we remember where the phone is positioned. These issues have been explored in spatial data management research <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, and more recently researchers have begun to consider whether it is possible to transfer some of the cognitive load to the perceptual domain [7].

Reference-contexts: These issues have been explored in spatial data management research [5, 6], and more recently researchers have begun to consider whether it is possible to transfer some of the cognitive load to the perceptual domain <ref> [7] </ref>. We may conclude, therefore, that humans have 3D perceptual and spatial skills which are largely ignored in today's user interfaces, partly because of technological limitations, and partly because some of the ideas are untested in real world applications. <p> By `well' here, we note that, for VR, the emphasis must be on maintaining seamless interaction rates, which implies keeping the closed loop feedback times low enough for perception of the world to be convincing. Although we know from our everyday experience that individual interactions may take significant time <ref> [7] </ref>, our overall perception of the world is smooth and immediate. Given this constraint, we conclude that any current VR model cannot simultaneously provide all the facilities desired for the range of applications we wish to support. This is a fact, and is unsurprising.

Reference-contexts: Because such practical issues are so important, little attention has been paid to other issues concerning the way we design and manipulate objects in three-dimensional space. There is a fundamental problem here, which is that human beings have very real difficulties in visualizing three-dimensional situations <ref> [10] </ref>. One of the major potential benefits of VR is that it opens up genuinely new ways to build and interact with designs which are not limited by flat display surfaces. For example, imagine a system in which it is possible to sketch in 3D [11].

Reference-contexts: In pilot training, for example, a completely enclosed environment may be acceptable. Equally, for some training tasks in which the user must move around, navigation techniques which permit a reasonable range of movement will prove appropriate <ref> [16] </ref>. But in other situations, users need to work in a normal office environment in which they can communicate with colleagues, drink coffee, read papers on their desk, and so on.

The basic support for time, space and causality would be appropriate here <ref> [19] </ref>. Beneath this we have a number of abstract worlds, which differ according to their fundamental spatial dimensionality. Below these are the broad classes of worlds that cover the most diverse world models (vector space, volume and 3D solid for example).

Reference-contexts: We have chosen a high performance, general purpose multicomputer the ParSiFal `T-Rack' - as the central processing resource. 5.1 The T-Rack The T-Rack was designed and built in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manch-ester as part of the Alvey sponsored ParSiFal (Parallel Simulation Facility) project <ref> [26] </ref>. It is a distributed memory machine, based upon the Inmos transputer [27]. The architecture of the T-Rack is shown in applications in this case the AVIARY software maybe implemented. These are collectively known as the `worker' transputer nodes. All inter-node communications within the T-Rack are performed via transputer links.

Reference-contexts: Problems such as this are alleviated by the ability of the T-Rack to dynamically re-arrange link connections at run-time, under the control of the distributed user application. This feature enables state data to be passed directly between arbitrary nodes in the network, wherever synchronism and latency are important issues <ref> [28] </ref>. 16 5.4 Peripherals Our virtual world model defines three fundamental types of peripheral: input devices (accepting data from users), output devices (supplying data to users) and external processing resources (supporting interaction with external applications).

Reference-contexts: Although individual transputer links do not have sufficient bandwidth to convey full screen pixel data at real-time rates, several such links may be used in parallel to write into a shared frame buffer <ref> [35] </ref>. An alternative solution is to use an off-board rendering subsystem, to which high-level graphical primitives are passed.

Reference-contexts: We have opted for this second strategy, because it reduces the number of external link ports needed to support graphical output, and allows special purpose hardware to be used for low-level rendering operations. This approach is similar to that of Division's ProVision system <ref> [36] </ref>. A custom graphics subsystem for the T-Rack is currently under development; its structure is illustrated in Figure 5. The hardware, as shown, provides stereoscopic output for a single user, and must therefore be duplicated if multiple users are to be supported.

Reference-contexts: The T-Rack is equipped with a high quality digital to analogue converter which accepts data from an outgoing transputer link, and generates 17 a stereo line signal. This facility was used in a recent research project which modelled the acoustic properties of 3D environments in real time <ref> [37] </ref>; such modelling techniques should be useful within a VR context. If the AVIARY system is to provide VR style interfaces for user applications, the machines on which these applications are hosted must be attached to the T-Rack in some way.
