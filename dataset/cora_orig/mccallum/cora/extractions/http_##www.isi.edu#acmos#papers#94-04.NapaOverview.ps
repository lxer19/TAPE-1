Abstract: This paper describes a framework for realizing low-power digital CMOS circuits using the principles of adiabatic switching. The starting point for all such systems is the observation that in CMOS circuits signal energies need not be dissipated but may be recycled or conserved under the appropriate conditions. From this observation to the point of demonstrating circuits that achieve low-power operation and do so at energy-dissipation levels which are competitive with other approaches to low-power design lie many challenges. This paper delves into the system design problems starting with the design of a simple reversible sequential logic chip that conserves signals energies into and out of the chip and finishes with the design of the necessary power supply elements for sequencing and powering the logic elements. Charge-control theory[1] analyzes the operation of electronic devices, such as amplifiers, from a modelling of the controlled versus controlling charges. Within this theory, the operation of MOSFET devices is distinguished by the fact that controlling charges can inuence controlled charges without requiring charges of opposite polarity to come into physical contact and consequently recombine. Action may occur as a result of the electric field across an insulator (SiO 2 in VLSI CMOS) with charges on one side of the insulator inducing a conducting channel on the other side of the insulator via an electric field. The controlling of charges from other charges is a fundamental mechanism to the operation of all digital circuits built from VLSI CMOS. Charge is injected from the power supply, steered through one or more MOSFET devices, and then returned to the power supply by the ground rail. This is the practice for realizing CMOS circuits that compute digital functions. The circuit topologies are driven by requirements of minimizing the number of devices required to compute a function and by requirements to maximize the speed at which computations can be performed. From an energy conservation standpoint, conventional practice represents a maximum of wastefulness. All charge is input to the circuit at voltage V and exits at voltage 0. The energy of the charge upon entry is CVV where C is the capacitance of the circuit and V the voltage. The energy of the charge upon exit is 0. Energy dissipation from delivery to removal of the charge is CV 2 . All of this energy is dissipated as heat. From a charge-control theory viewpoint, it is known that this does not have to be the case. Charges can be controlled without the controlling or controlled charge giving up their energy as heat. The well-known principle 1 , which we call the adiabatic charging principle, asserts that it is possible to cycle a signal through a resistance without dissipating CV 2 of energy by slowing down the speed of energy transport between the power supply and the circuits signal node. By doing so, energy that would otherwise be dissipated in the resistance is conserved for later reuse. The advantage can readily be understood by assuming a constant current source that delivers the charge CV over a time period T. The dissipation through a resistance R is then:

Reference-contexts: Practical circuits must include both a scheme for computing functions so that the energies of circuit nodes may be conserved, and a scheme for delivering and recovering the energy as charge moves between the power supply and the circuit. Our first chip, called the Adiabatic Line Driver Chip (ALDC) <ref> [3] </ref> was tested with a prototype power supply that could deliver and recover signal energies using an inductor and a tank capacitor (Figure 1).
