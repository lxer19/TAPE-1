Abstract: Knowledge-based cooperative query answering facilities have been introduced to the GIS for approximate query answering. We use context-sensitive spatial type abstraction hierarchies to provide such cooperative capabilities. As a result, the ranges of the approximate spatial operators can be automatically determined by STAHs, rather than specified by domain experts. Thus these operators are context-sensitive. Further, STAHs can be generated automatically from geographic databases and thus is scalable. A prototype system - CoGIS has been implemented to incorporate these cooperative capabilities.

Map-based spatial operators are later introduced to improve the query answering capabilities. Such operators are area, length, centroid, perimeter, located, within, contain, union, intersection, and difference <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. In addition, approximate spatial operators, such as near-to, between, and south-of, are also studied and implemented in some systems [9, 13]. The advent of knowledge based systems promises many new ways to enhance GIS.

To do so, it relaxes query conditions by utilizing the domain knowledge Type Abstraction Hierarchies (TAHs).

Reference-contexts: The query condition is relaxed by generalization (moving up the TAH) and specialization (moving down the TAH), e.g., from 6000ft to Medium-Range to 4000ft, 6000ft, or 8000ft. TAHs provide a structured way for query relaxation which is different from the rule-based approach [5]. Moreover, we have developed methodologies <ref> [3, 10] </ref> to automatically construct TAHs from databases. Thus, this knowledge structure for query relaxation is scalable to large information systems. 3.2 Cooperative Operators Although CoBase uses relaxation when no answer is found, query modification may also be specified explicitly by the user through a set of cooperative operators. <p> But it is impossible to provide context-sensitive ranges for every situation. To remedy this problem, we use the Spatial Type Abstraction Hierarchies (STAHs). 4.2 Spatial Type Abstraction Hierarchies In CoBase, we have developed a method to construct TAHs based on the data distribution <ref> [3] </ref>. We extend this method to create STAHs. A STAH differs from a regular TAH in that it is based on multiple attributes rather than a single attribute. For example, the spatial distance between objects can be more precisely represented by (; ).

CoGIS supports approximate spatial operators such as near-to, between, south-of, north-of, east-of, and west-of. The difficulty of implementing such approximate spatial operators is the impreciseness of these operators their meanings vary depending on contexts and domains <ref> [9] </ref>. For example a hospital near to LAX is different from an airport near to LAX. Likewise, the nearness of a hospital in a metropolitan area is different from the one in a rural area. A simple and common approach to this problem is the use of pre-specified ranges.

Reference-contexts: Thus, similar-to is a multiple-attribute operator with a weight assigned to each attribute in accordance with the relative importance of that attribute. The similarity of each object is evaluated against the given object by calculating the weighted mean-squared error over the list of the attributes <ref> [11] </ref>. The similar objects are listed in ranked order, along with their measures. * Nonrelaxable list specifies the query conditions that may not be relaxed. * relaxation-order specifies the order that query conditions should be relaxed.

Reference-contexts: Using spatial relationships can significantly enhance the querying capability. Some of the relationships are precisely defined and can usually be inferred or calculated from existing geographical information based on geometry theory <ref> [12] </ref>. Our system provides the following spatial operators to express these spatial relationships: * located: point vs point. * within: point vs line/area; line/area vs area. * contain: area vs point/line/area. * intersect: line/area vs line/area. * union: area vs area. * difference: area vs area.

But it requires experts to provide such information, thus making it difficult to scale up to larger applications or to be extended to different domains. Subramanian and Adam <ref> [13] </ref> propose an AI approach to automate this process. However, their analogical-reasoning approach transforms an approximate spatial operator into another equally-imprecise operator, such as near-to into short-drive or short-flight. As we discussed in Section 4, we have developed a method to cluster objects based on data distribution in STAHs.
