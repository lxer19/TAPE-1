Abstract: The concept of the global information infrastructure and specifically that of the World Wide Web (WWW) has led to users accessing data of different media including images and video data over a wide area network. These data objects have sizes the order of megabytes and communication time is very large. The data size can be reduced without losing information by applying loss-inducing techniques and this will lead to reduction in communication time. Several loss-inducing techniques have been developed and each image is treated differently by each technique. In some cases an acceptable quality of the image is obtained and in some cases it is not. In this paper we develop a color-based technique to quantify the data loss when a loss-inducing technique is applied to an image. This will result in estimating whether the resulting image is indistinguishable from the original with respect to the human eye. We illustrate its use to classify images according to the loss they can tolerate. This avoids redundant communication of a high quality image when a lower quality image can satisfy the application resulting in the conservation and better usage of network resources. We present the technique, the communication time saved, and an experimental evaluation to prove the validity of the technique.

Reference-contexts: The result of these techniques is the reduction of communication time and storage space. Visual data like images and video are rich in semantic content and careful manipulation will result in data so that no visible information is lost <ref> [1] </ref>. They can be stored, manipulated and viewed in multiple levels of quality. <p> Lossy compression techniques can result in an image which has less data and lower quality. For several applications it would suffice to get a lower quality image if the response time is lower <ref> [1] </ref>. School children accessing NASA's repository of image data is one such application. In such a scenario, a lower quality image which is visually indistinguishable from the original is sufficient. Another application is video-conferencing which has a realtime requirement of maintaining frame rate.

The technique we have proposed takes as input an image and its loss-induced version and outputs the col diff (color difference) between them.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Global Information Infrastructure brings about the integration, management, and communication of gigabytes of data in a parallel and distributed environment over national and international networks <ref> [3] </ref>. A global digital library should provide everyone in the world access to distributed stores of information at a reasonable cost. Digital library data objects are distributed; they are large in size, of the order of gigabytes. <p> Table 1 presents the communication times for the original image and the loss-induced image (the loss inducing technique here is compressing to 10% JPEG). In this example image data size is 480K. The evaluation of communication time was presented in an earlier paper <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.3 Granularity Granularity refers to the number of colors used to form the histogram and calculate col diff. Different file formats use different number of colors. GIF uses only 256 colors (8-bit) while JPEG uses 16 million colors (24-bit).

Reference-contexts: In such a scenario, a lower quality image which is visually indistinguishable from the original is sufficient. Another application is video-conferencing which has a realtime requirement of maintaining frame rate. A lower quality frame would suffice as long as the video-conferencing session is not disrupted <ref> [4] </ref> and the frame does not completely deteriorate in quality. Current techniques of communicating multimedia data over a wide area network function by transmitting all the data.

Reference-contexts: Different loss-inducing techniques operate on different images differently. No technique has an uniform method of operating on all images. For example, it is known that GIF performs better than JPEG when uniform color segments are involved but JPEG performs better than GIF for natural scene images <ref> [6] </ref>. Every technique exploits image content, or image properties like texture, color, repeated patterns differently to result in a lower image size. <p> Problem Statement: The purpose of this experiment was to verify the validity of our technique when JPEG lossy compression is used. JPEG works well on some material like photographs, naturalistic artwork, but not so well on certain other material like lettering, simple cartoons, or line drawings <ref> [6] </ref>. Method: We compressed the 150 images in our test set to 50%, 30% and 10% and applied our technique to compare the original image with the compressed image. As in the previous experiment, the users were required to rank the images according to the quality they perceived.

Reference-contexts: It does not reconstruct the original image bit-for-bit but reconstructs an image which to the human eye looks very similar to the original. JPEG primarily stores information on color changes, particularly variations in brightness, because the eye is very sensitive to this <ref> [7] </ref>. One can choose the extent of compression while choosing JPEG. The extent of compression decides how much data is lost. We use percentages to denote the compression level. A 10% JPEG file is one which has retained 10% of the original file.

Reference-contexts: This is mainly due to the prescence of text in the Red image. 4.2.2 Experiment 2: Lossy Compression Lossy compression is another loss-inducing technique. We chose JPEG as our lossy compression technique <ref> [11] </ref>. It does not reconstruct the original image bit-for-bit but reconstructs an image which to the human eye looks very similar to the original. JPEG primarily stores information on color changes, particularly variations in brightness, because the eye is very sensitive to this [7].
