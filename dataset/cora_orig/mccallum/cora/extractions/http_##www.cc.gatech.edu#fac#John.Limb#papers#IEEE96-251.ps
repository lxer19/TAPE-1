Abstract: We present here a MAC protocol that is without any framing structure in the control mechanism and built around a "sea of mini-slots". Most of the elements of the protocol have been previously described in one of more of the MAC proposals made to the subcommittee. The performance under both static and highly dynamic loads is close to optimum. The station implementation is particularly simple and the downstream control structure is also simple. It is consistent with most of the decisions so far made in the MAC draft specification. The results given here are for ATM framing, but the algorithm extends very simply to variable length MAC frames.

Reference-contexts: Herein we show that very efficient algorithms can be devised that use no control framing while at the same time being very simple to implement, stable under extreme conditions and flexible to various MAC frame structures such as fixed and variable length fames. 2 Description of the Method In <ref> [1] </ref> it is pointed out that the performance of the protocol depends more on the overall framing than the details of the Contention Resolution Algorithm (CRA). We have assumed that there is no larger frame structure used in the scheduling of data traffic.

Reference-contexts: As the load increases further, reservations may be made via the piggyback channel and hence the number of CMS's required will decrease. The solution to the number of CMS's to allocate is rather simple: allocate all slots that are not being used for data as CMS's <ref> [2] </ref>. At low load very many more CMS's will be allocated than are required. The surplus of CMS's reduces the probability of collision to a very low level which in turn reduces the access delay for the data; every collision adds one round-trip period to the access delay. <p> All the results obtained herein used the algorithm of Rivest as described in [3] and also used in <ref> [2] </ref>. The performance of the p-persistence algorithm is not very sensitive to the exact value of p. Ideally p would equal 1/N a , where N a is the number of users competing for each slot.
