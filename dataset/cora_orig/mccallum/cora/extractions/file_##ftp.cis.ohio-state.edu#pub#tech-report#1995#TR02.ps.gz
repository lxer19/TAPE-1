Title: Space Deformation using Ray Deectors  
Author: Yair Kurzion and Roni Yagel

Note: Submitted to SIGGRAPH95.  
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new approach to the deformation of surface and raster models in two and three dimensions. Rather then deforming the objects in the model, we deform the rays used to render the scene. The mechanism to specify the deformation, which we call a deector, is a vector of gravity positioned in space. This gravity vector bends any ray that travels through its field of gravity. Images generated by these curved rays give the impression of a deformed space. Unlike previous methods that deform all the objects in the scene, our approach deforms only those parts of the model that contribute to the final image. In addition, using deectors, our approach can deform any object type that can be rendered by a ray casting algorithm, providing a unified solution to space deformation.

Reference-contexts: When we deform space, neighboring rays may be distant after their deection into the deformed space. This can cause holes in space where none of the rays we shoot arrive. In order to solve that problem, we have to use a mip-mapped version of the volume <ref> [15] </ref>. We can then acquire each sample along a ray from the mip-map level corresponding to the distance between two neighboring rays. As in Section 4.4, we can calculate the local distance between two neighboring rays by deecting three additional points.
