Abstract: To design tools that will utilise the Internet's Multicast Backbone effectively requires an understanding of the processes that affect multicast traffic. In this paper we examine what can be discovered about mbone performance from the point of view of a single end-system. In so doing we derive a valuable insight into how packet loss in the mbone affects traffic flows. Based on this insight, we make suggestions as to how various classes of multicast application much be better designed and to the limits of some mechanisms that have been suggested.

Reference-contexts: stream in the face of persistent high levels of congestion as the dropped packets unnecessarily use up bandwidth between the sender and the bottleneck, and more well behaved traffic sharing the bottleneck will suffer significantly. 3 in as much as TCP receives a fair share of the bandwidth Layered encodings <ref> [1] </ref> have been suggested as one solution to this problem of heterogeneity, and indeed show great promise as a mechanism to allow different data rates to be delivered to different receivers depending on available resources.

Reference-contexts: If this data is extrapolated, it shows that multicast applications that attempt to adjust so that no receiver is suffering significant loss will almost inevitably adjust so that they send no data (or whatever their minimum data rate is configured to). Thus schemes such as <ref> [2] </ref> are unlikely to be useful in the wide area mbone as we see it today. Consecutive Losses The graphs in figure 10 (A-C) show the frequency of RTP sequence number increments as observed at UCL on each of several days.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately this extra gain comes at the expense of extra delay in the case of this audio coding scheme so may or may not be worthwhile depending on the purpose of the stream itself. Whilst these results agree with the conclusions of Bolot <ref> [3] </ref>, the two-stage Gilbert model used only provides a first order approximation to these results. Figure 10B shows a two-state Gilbert model (figure 11, p=0.083, q=0.823).

Reference-contexts: Thus we believe that queuing algorithms such as RED and Fair Queuing are necessary to allow such applications to obtain more meaningful feedback from the network about appropriate transmission bandwidths. Two other studies <ref> [5] </ref>[14] of this area have been performed. The work of Bolot et al [5] studies temporally correlated loss in fixed bit-rate audio streams, and finds results which are in general agreement with this study. Ya-jnik et al [14] study both spacial and temporal loss corre lation by using dedicated monitoring software at 17 sites.

Reference-contexts: Most current RMPs tend to rely on retransmission of missing packets, and the primary difference between such RMPs is in the mechanisms for scalably deciding who can report loss, and in who can perform the retransmission. For example, SRM <ref> [6] </ref> is based around both timer and probabilistic delay of NACKs, then multicasting NACKS which serve to suppress duplicate retransmission requests. <p> In such situations the majority of packets will be NACKed and retrans-mitted at least once. In the vanilla SRM described in <ref> [6] </ref> all NACKs and retransmissions are sent to all receivers, and this may result in very significant retransmission overhead. In [7] the possibility of local recovery mechanisms is discussed.

Reference-contexts: In such situations the majority of packets will be NACKed and retrans-mitted at least once. In the vanilla SRM described in [6] all NACKs and retransmissions are sent to all receivers, and this may result in very significant retransmission overhead. In <ref> [7] </ref> the possibility of local recovery mechanisms is discussed. These show promise to help this situation in the case of a small number of particularly congested links by dynamically discovering significant loss points and performing local retransmission across the lossy link to the downstream receivers.

Reference-contexts: Thus for such real-time adaptive streams, it appears that we need support from router forwarding engines such as would be provided by RED <ref> [8] </ref> and Fair Queuing [10][13] before we can design even receiver driven multicast congestion control mechanisms that will accurately sense appropriate network bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Such period loss patterns are likely to result from a periodic effect in the network itself. In the past, Van Ja cobson has attributed similar effects to a bug in certain routers, where they invalidate their interface routing cache while processing routing updates, and to synchronisation of routing updates <ref> [9] </ref>. Although these seem likely there is not enough data in these RTP or RTCP figures to verify either hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: In the case of applications such as UCL's Robust-Audio Tool <ref> [11] </ref> and INRIA's FreePhone audio tool that provide redundancy by carrying a highly compressed redundant copy of data one or more packets behind the primary encoding, these curves show that there is some gain from adding the redundant encoding more than one packet behind the primary. <p> of receivers for which very high loss rates and a lack of correlation with other receivers mean that unicast is still the best option. 4.3 Audio and Video For packet audio traffic without any form of loss protection or masking, the limits to comprehensibilty are reached at around 10% loss <ref> [11] </ref>, although it may become annoying at lower loss rates. Simple error correction techniques [11][4] exist that increase this comprehensibility limit, and make loss much less noticable at lower loss rates, although the distribution of consecutive losses shown in figure 10 mean that noticable artifacts are likely to occur at lower

Reference-contexts: Thus it is very unclear how techniques such as RLM <ref> [12] </ref> would fair in such scenarios.
