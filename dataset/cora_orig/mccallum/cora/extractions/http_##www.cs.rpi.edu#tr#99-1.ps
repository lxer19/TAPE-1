Abstract: This review paper will report on some recent discoveries in the area of Formal Languages, chiefly by F. Otto, G. Buntrock and G. Niemann. These discoveries have pointed out certain break-throughs connected with the concept of growing context-sensitive languages, which originated in the 1980's with a paper by E. Dahlhaus and M.K. Warmuth. One important result is that the deterministic growing context-sensitive languages turn out to be identical to an interesting family of formal languages definable in a certain way by confluent reduction systems.

Reference-contexts: Another was the family of CSL's with linear-bounded derivations (see, e.g., 1 Ron Book's dissertation [2]), i.e., languages having a CSG with a bound B such that every w 2 fl derived in the grammar has a derivation whose length is Bjwj.

Reference-contexts: The GrCSL's are just one of many studied families properly between the CFL's and the CSL's. Another was the family of CSL's with linear-bounded derivations (see, e.g., 1 Ron Book's dissertation <ref> [2] </ref>), i.e., languages having a CSG with a bound B such that every w 2 fl derived in the grammar has a derivation whose length is Bjwj. <p> In 1964 Gladkij proved in [1] that the CSL fwcw R cwjw 2 fa; bg fl g does not have linear-bounded derivations (see also the appendix to <ref> [2] </ref>). (w R means w written backwards.) More recently it has been proved that the GrCSL's are a proper subfamily of the family of CSL's with linear bounded derivations (see [12], and also [13], Corollary 5.4). However, the latter family will no longer be of concern in this paper.

Reference-contexts: In effect, the D-shrink is a suitable mechanism for reduction of the word in the reduction system; in fact, precisely suitable. This automaton is similar to the automaton conceived by Ron Book <ref> [4] </ref> to reduce a word according to a reduction system with the Church-Rosser property.

Reference-contexts: The insertion would be between the CFL's (context-free languages) and the CSL's (context-sensitive languages), in effect making a new family designated as the "type one-and-a-half languages". This family began to receive attention in 1986, when Dahlhaus and Warmuth published their result <ref> [5] </ref> that the complexity of its membership problem had a polynomial-time algorithm, in contrast to the P-space-complete membership problem for the larger family of context-sensitive languages. <p> Moreover, as mentioned, the membership problem for every GrCSL has a polynomial-time algorithm. (The proof in <ref> [5] </ref> goes over to our new definition of GrCSL.) Dahlhaus and Warmuth [5] prove that every GrCSL is log-tape reducible to some CFL. <p> Moreover, as mentioned, the membership problem for every GrCSL has a polynomial-time algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, the latter family will no longer be of concern in this paper. From the work of Lautemann <ref> [6] </ref> and Buntrock [12] it follows that the language fwwjw 2 fa; bg fl g is not a GrCSL. (See also [13], especially the penultimate paragraph of Section 1.) Thus we have an improvement on the Gladkij language for a paradigm CSL that is not a GrCSL.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, most interesting formal languages are not congruential. However, if we allow ourselves to supplement the alphabet of the reduction system to include some control characters along with the alphabet of the language, we get something that is more fruitful. The paper <ref> [7] </ref> investigated the question of which formal languages could be defined in this way. The results and conceptual development of that paper have recently been surpassed in a remarkable way by Niemann and Otto [14], whom the present exposition will follow. <p> These results settled questions left open in <ref> [7] </ref>. Furthermore, they make the characterization of DGrCSL's in terms of rewriting systems even more significant than they appear at first. They also strengthen our feeling that the DGrCSL's constitute an important family of languages. <p> They also strengthen our feeling that the DGrCSL's constitute an important family of languages. An interesting open question concerns the language fww R jw 2 fa; bg fl g, which is clearly a GrCSL, since it is context-free. I conjecture, however, that it is not a DGrCSL. In <ref> [7] </ref> there is a plausibility argument that it is not a CRL. In conclusion, I suspect there will probably be few theoreticians who will press for any modification of the Chomsky hierarchy.

As pointed out in <ref> [8] </ref>, the family of GrCSL's is an abstract family of languages, that is to say, this family is closed under union, concatenation, star iteration, intersection with regular languages, null-word-free homomorphisms and inverse homomorphisms.

Reference-contexts: But then the two reduction sequences must eventually come together. (For a good exposition of string rewriting systems, see the first two chapters of <ref> [9] </ref>.) Some languages can be defined by confluent reduction systems; if the alphabet of the system is the same as the alphabet of the language then the language is a congruential language, i.e., the union of some of the congruence classes of a congruence relation over fl .

Reference-contexts: the CSL fwcw R cwjw 2 fa; bg fl g does not have linear-bounded derivations (see also the appendix to [2]). (w R means w written backwards.) More recently it has been proved that the GrCSL's are a proper subfamily of the family of CSL's with linear bounded derivations (see <ref> [12] </ref>, and also [13], Corollary 5.4).

Indeed there is reason to regard the subclass of DGrCSL's as being more important than the larger family of GrCSL's.

All CFL's consisting of words of length 2 are GrCSL's. The easy proof is by a constructive modification of the Chomsky normal form. <p> We can get a corresponding 2 result for GrCSL's by modifying this automaton to one whose tape decreases in its weighted length at every move. The best way to work out this idea precisely is to follow Buntrock and Otto in Section 3 of <ref> [13] </ref>, stipulating an automaton with two pushdown tapes, representing the portions of the LBA tape to the left of the head and the right of the head, respectively. <p> Moreover, as mentioned, the membership problem for every GrCSL has a polynomial-time algorithm. (The proof in [5] goes over to our new definition of GrCSL.) Dahlhaus and Warmuth [5] prove that every GrCSL is log-tape reducible to some CFL.

As pointed out in [8], the family of GrCSL's is an abstract family of languages, that is to say, this family is closed under union, concatenation, star <p> The name for this automaton is rather long; let us call it a "D-shrink" for short. As it is an important concept, it deserves a formal definition. The following is adapted from the paper by Buntrock and Otto <ref> [13] </ref>: A D-shrink is a 7-tuple (Q; ; ; ffi; q 0 ; B; F ): Here Q is the set of states, the input alphabet, the tape alphabet ( ae and " Q = ;), q 0 is the initial state, B is the bottom marker of the two pushdown <p> As it now stands each family in the hierarchy is a subclass of the deterministic subclass of the family at the next level.

Whether or not it deserves a place in the Chomsky hierarchy, the family of GrCSL's is an important family.

As proved in <ref> [13] </ref> and [14], a language L is a GenCRL if and only if it is a DGrCSL. In effect, the D-shrink is a suitable mechanism for reduction of the word in the reduction system; in fact, precisely suitable.

Reference-contexts: The simple argument for intersection <ref> [14] </ref> is as follows: It is easy to see that the Gladkij language fwcw R cwjw 2 fa; bg fl g is equal to the intersection of two deterministic CFL's, which are therefore both DGrCSL's; but the Gladkij language itself is not a DGrCSL. <p> That this family is also not closed under union follows by the DeMorgan law, since the family is closed under complementation. Other such results can be found in Section 5 of <ref> [14] </ref>.) 3. Confluent string rewriting systems. Perhaps the greatest selling point for the family of GrCSL's is its link with the theory of rewriting systems as it has been developing since 1970. <p> More specifically, the selling point is for the family of DGrCSL's, which turns out to be identical to a family of languages definable in a certain way by confluent string rewriting systems, as discovered recently by Niemann and Otto <ref> [14] </ref>. Briefly, a string rewriting system is a semi-Thue system. We focus on systems in which the application of a rule to a word results in a simplification of the word: for example, it may be that jfij &lt; jffj holds for each rule ff ! fi. <p> The paper [7] investigated the question of which formal languages could be defined in this way. The results and conceptual development of that paper have recently been surpassed in a remarkable way by Niemann and Otto <ref> [14] </ref>, whom the present exposition will follow. <p> If we find that there is no such subword and the word at that point is not simply Y then we know that the original word w is not in L.

In effect, the D-shrink is a suitable mechanism for reduction of the word in the reduction system; in fact, precisely suitable. <p> In effect, the D-shrink is a suitable mechanism for reduction of the word in the reduction system; in fact, precisely suitable. This automaton is similar to the automaton conceived by Ron Book [4] to reduce a word according to a reduction system with the Church-Rosser property. In <ref> [14] </ref> it is demonstrated that every GenCRL is also a CRL; in other words the reduction system can be modified so as to allow the length function as the weighting function (i.e., for each x 2 , OE (x) = 1).
