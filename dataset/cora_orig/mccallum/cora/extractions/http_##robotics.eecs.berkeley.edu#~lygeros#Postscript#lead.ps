Abstract: We present longitudinal control laws for vehicles moving in an Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (IVHS) [1] [2]. In particular the scenario where cars move along the highway in tightly spaced platoons is considered. We present control schemes that perform the major longitudinal tasks that will be required from the lead vehicle of a platoon moving on an automated highway. More specifically schemes that maintain safe spacing, track an optimal velocity and perform various maneuvers (forming, breaking up platoons and changing lanes) are described. Simulation results are given in the Appendix.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The work presented here was carried out with the particular IVHS structure of <ref> [3] </ref> in mind. In this context it is assumed that traffic in a lane travels in platoons. Inside a platoon all the vehicles follow the leader with a small intra-platoon separation of 1 meter. <p> The inter-platoon spacing is assumed to be large so as to isolate the platoons from each other. Obviously the control of such a large scale system poses a formidable problem. The control structure suggested in <ref> [3] </ref> consists of three layers. <p> This is desirable as it guarantees that the disturbance will not be magnified as it propagates form one platoon to the next. * kH (j!)k &lt; 1; 8! This condition is required for disturbance attenuation and avoidance of the slinky effect between platoons. Refer to [8], <ref> [3] </ref> for details. <p> Apart from this default mode of operation, however, the leader of a platoon will occasionally have to engage in other maneuvers as the platoon moves along the automated highway. There are three such basic maneuvers: /em merge, split and change lane (see <ref> [3] </ref> and [13] for the motivation behind this choice of maneuvers and their coordination layer implementation). All three have some common features and therefore the design of the controllers that carry them out is very similar. Merge is the action taken by two platoons that want to become one. <p> So, apart from the obvious lateral action, change lane also involves longitudinal control. It is clear that all these maneuvers involve both coordination and regulation layer control. The protocols required in the coordination layer have already been developed and verified (see <ref> [3] </ref> and [13]). We will only deal with how the regulation layer responds to commands issued by the coordination layer requesting some maneuver. The coordination of the two layers will be the subject of further research.

Reference-contexts: Our work focuses on the regulation layer. Within the platooning framework the regulation layer operation can be divided into two main modes: leader and follower. Controllers for the latter have already been designed and tested both in simulation and in experiments (see <ref> [4] </ref>, [5], [6], [7]). We propose a controller for the leader mode. Such a controller should be able to perform three main tasks. The first is to follow the preceding platoon at a safe distance.

For small disturbances which keep the state close to the operating condition, we can use the following PID controller, suggested by S. Sheik-holeslam <ref> [6] </ref>: 3 = c i e i dt + c p e i + c v _e i Under this control law the closed loop transfer function relating the spacing error experienced by platoon i 1 to the spacing error experienced by platoon i is: H (s) = e i1 (s)

Reference-contexts: Section 4 outlines the design of specialized control laws for the individual maneuvers of merge, split and change lane. Simulation results are presented in the Appendix. 2 Model of the car The equations used to model the motion of the car are the same as the ones used in <ref> [8] </ref> and [9]. <p> This is quite a strong assumption as these quantities are usually known only approximately and might change with time, even for the same car. However it allows us to linearize the model by state feedback as discussed in the next section (see also <ref> [8] </ref>, [9]). An adaptive version of the controller may be designed at a later stage to relax this assumption somewhat (see [10]). 3 Intelligent Cruise Control De sign The controller design was carried out in 2 stages, as outlined in Figure 2. <p> This is desirable as it guarantees that the disturbance will not be magnified as it propagates form one platoon to the next. * kH (j!)k &lt; 1; 8!

Reference-contexts: The conditions that characterize this class of systems can be found in the literature ([11] and <ref> [12] </ref>). The system in question, however, is simple enough to allow us to obtain the linearizing state feedback law by inspection, without having to go into the details of nonlinear control theory.

Reference-contexts: This addition also helped to make the regulation layer as autonomous as possible and to highlight its interaction with the coordination layer. The analysis of this interface design is presented in <ref> [14] </ref>. The resulting combination of the coordinator and the controllers presented here is currently being tested in the framework of the SmartPath simulation package (see [15]). The complete regulation layer was used to introduce dynamics into SmartPath and therefore help with the design and testing of the link layer controller.
