Abstract: Industrial imaging systems used for product quality control often need to make an accurate estimation of an object's area. Usually the area is estimated by counting the number of pixels classified as belonging to the object. However, with a technique called decomposition, the number of pixels can be estimated more accurately at the same resolution, or as accurately at a lower resolution. Another way to reduce the hardware costs is to lower the spatial sampling rate. The negative effects on the area estimation accuracy can be counteracted by reconstructing the original image using interpolation. In this paper, we present the results of two experiments using HP ScanJet 4c images in which the capabilities and limitations of decomposition and interpolation were assessed quantitatively. It appeared that the resolution could be lowered with a factor 25 without decreasing the accuracy of the estimation. A reduction of the sampling rate, on the other hand, could not be compensated for as well. However, interpolation did seem to restrict the decrease in accuracy somewhat, although the results were not entirely conclusive due to hardware related reasons.

Reference-contexts: One of the differences between an along-track scanner and a flatbed scanner is that the first relies on solar radiation while the latter needs an separate light source to expose the original. As is shown in Figure 1 (b) (adopted from Bessner and Grant <ref> [1] </ref>), the radiation emitted by the light bar is reflected by the original, and the image is focused onto an array of CCD's using a lens and a couple of mirrors.

Reference-contexts: In horizontal direction this implies that 600 CCD's are placed on every inch of the sensor array, while in vertical direction the motor moving the light bar can take steps as small as 1 600 inch (see Bone <ref> [2] </ref>). It is assumed that at the maximum sampling rate the consecutively sampled IFOV's are just contiguous, so there is no gap between neighbouring image pixels, nor do they overlap. <p> The one-dimensional cubic convolution kernel r (x) must be (1) symmetric, (2) zero outside the interval <ref> [2; 2] </ref>, (3) continuous with a continuous first derivative, and (4) satisfy r (0) = 1, r (x) = 0 for x = 1; 2.

Reference-contexts: This strategy is possible only if the desired sampling rate is an integral factor of the maximum sampling rate, and is applied solely by the lower-end scanners for which speed is of great importance (see Bone <ref> [3] </ref>). High-end scanners utilise a computationally more expensive technique, which must also be used for sampling rates that do not fit the maximum sampling rate an integral number of times. <p> to decompose a mixed pixel using the spectral characteristics of its contributing objects, leading to a more accurate area estimation. 3 For some sampling rates it is possible to sample at a lower rate and resample to the higher frequency without noticeably different results but an increase in speed (Bone <ref> [3] </ref>). 3 (a) The effects of using a higher sampling rate.

Reference-contexts: not undersampled, it can be reconstructed by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum in the fundamental interval (grey rectangle). 4.1 Image sampling and reconstruction In a perfect image sampling system, a continuous, ideal image field is sampled by multiplying it by a spatial sampling function (Gonzalez and Woods <ref> [4] </ref>, Pratt [17]). The sampling function is composed of an infinite array of Dirac delta functions, which are arranged in a grid of spacing (x; y) as is shown in Figure 4 (a).

Reference-contexts: For remotely-sensed images the linear mixture model has shown to be a good abstraction for mixed pixels. Although there are many variants on this model (Pech et al. [16], Settle and Drake [19], Klein Gebbinck and Schouten [9]), the classical linear mixture model by Horwitz et al. <ref> [5] </ref> is still much used. Following the nomenclature of Settle and Drake, this model is given by x = Mf + e; (1) where vector x denotes the n-dimensional pixel, and vector f represents the proportions of the c objects that take part in the mixed pixel. <p> In theory e is also distributed multivariate normally, having a zero mean and a variance-covariance matrix N depending on the distributions as well as the fractions of the objects. However, it has been argued (Horwitz et al. <ref> [5] </ref>) that N can be approximated by the averaged variance-covariance matrices of the objects without much loss of accuracy, but resulting in a set of equations that is much more tractable.

Reference-contexts: The interpolation kernel that is needed is found by convolving the nearest neighbour kernel with itself. The cubic B-spline interpolation kernel (Hou and Andrews <ref> [6] </ref>), finally, is constructed by four convolutions of the rectangular kernel. As a result, the kernel spans four samples, two on each side of the point to be interpolated. <p> As a result, the kernel spans four samples, two on each side of the point to be interpolated. Although cubic B-spline interpolation gives the best results, it is also computationally expensive because for every four consecutive samples a matrix problem has to be solved (Hou andAndrews <ref> [6] </ref>). Nearest neighbour interpolation, on the other hand, does not suffice either, because samples are merely replicated. For the problem of area estimation this boils down to exact same situation as is reached by scaling the area per sample|see Figure 3. <p> The last name may give the reader the impression that cubic convolution is the same as cubic B-spline interpolation (Hou and Andrews <ref> [6] </ref>), but this is not the case. What they have in common is that they both use a cubic spline interpolation kernel, which by definition is a piecewise continuous function composed of third-order polynomials; the constraints imposed on these polynomials, however, are different.

Reference-contexts: Since only one flatbed scanner was available and its detector elements could not be changed, images captured with CCD's with larger IFOV's had to be simulated. The usual way to construct these images is to apply spatial degradation of high-resolution images of the same scene.

Reference-contexts: A way to suppress these ripples is to replace the truncated sinc by an approximating function having a continuous slope at x = 2. A well-known implementation of this idea is cubic convolution (Keys <ref> [8] </ref>), which is also known as parametric cubic convolution (Park and Schowengerdt [13]), (bi)cubic interpolation (MATLAB [12]), and high-resolution cubic spline interpolation (Parker et al.

Reference-contexts: Another option is truncating sinc (x) to a practical width, say jxj 2. However, just like cutting off higher frequencies of the spectrum causes ringing in the image, truncating the sinc function introduces ripples in the spectrum (Park and Schowengerdt <ref> [13] </ref>). A way to suppress these ripples is to replace the truncated sinc by an approximating function having a continuous slope at x = 2.

Figure 7 (a) shows the cubic convolution kernel for ff = 1 2 , while in Figure 7 (b) the corresponding spectrum is displayed. From the spectra it is clear that cubic convolution approximates the ideal low-pass filter much better than linear interpolation does.

According to Park et al. <ref> [14] </ref> this design is common for most sensor array systems, although to this date HP has not confirmed this. Most scanners, including the ScanJet 4c, are able to scan at a different sampling rate than is specified by the optical resolution.

Nearest neighbour interpolation (Parker et al. <ref> [15] </ref>) gives the point to be interpolated the value of the sample to which it is closest.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 (a), adopted from Sabins <ref> [18] </ref>, shows the operation of a typical multispectral along-track scanner. This scanner is equipped with three arrays of detectors, one for each spectral band, which are oriented perpendicularly to the flight direction. Associated with each detector is an instantaneous field of view (IFOV), subtending an area called ground resolution cell. <p> The Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4c is a flatbed single-pass color scanner of around $1000. The optical resolution of this scanner is 600dpi 2 in horizontal as well as in vertical direction. In fact, the term resolution is a bit confusing in this case. Sabins <ref> [18] </ref> defines spatial resolution as "the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects on an image." This definition shows that resolution is a subjective measure which depends on many factors, e.g. resolution cell size, spatial sampling rate, number of bits used for quantisation, etc.

Reference-contexts: It can be determined by making a low-resolution scan|about 75dpi is high enough| of a clean white surface. After equalising the histogram of the resulting image, spots that are too dark can be easily recognised (Sullivan <ref> [20] </ref>). The sweetspot of the scanner that was used is shown in Figure 9. To create a reference segmentation, the image of the IC was placed on the scanner's sweetspot and scanned at the maximum resolution of 600dpi 7 .

Reference-contexts: An approach which may give more accurate results can be found in the field of image registration, where the objective is to register a pair of images with subpixel accuracy. The intensity interpolation method (Tian and Huhns <ref> [21] </ref>) attempts to reconstruct one of the images as closely as possible before the displacement of the other image is calculated. If the same reconstruction technique is used before area estimation, the accuracy of the estimation may be higher as well|see Figure 3 (b).
