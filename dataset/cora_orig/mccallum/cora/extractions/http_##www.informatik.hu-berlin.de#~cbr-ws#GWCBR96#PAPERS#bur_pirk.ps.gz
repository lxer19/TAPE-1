Abstract: Case based reasoning (CBR) uses the knowledge from former experiences ("known cases"). Since special knowledge of an expert is mainly subject to his experiences, the CBR techniques are a good base for the development of expert systems. We investigate the problem for technical diagnosis. Diagnosis is not considered as a classification task, but as a process to be guided by computer assisted experience. This corresponds to the flexible "case completion" approach. Flexibility is also needed for the expert view with predominant interest in the unexpected, unpredictible cases.

Reference-contexts: Instead, different (usually small) sets of symptoms are relevant for different problems. 2. Diagnosis is a process: Starting with some known symptoms, further tests must be performed until enough knowledge about the problem is collected. A good diagnosis tool should guide this process (as in MOLTKE <ref> [1] </ref>). 3. Special facts in case descriptions (e.g. "engine defect") may be considered in some contexts as part of a problem description, while they may serve as the "solution" in other contexts. 4.

Reference-contexts: In our project are to be combined: Reasoning about time and space: The representations of facts and relations concerning time and space are investigated with special effort to similarity concepts. This is a part of common sense knowledge <ref> [2] </ref>. Reasoning about mechanics and electricity/electronics: Concepts, rules and physical laws have to be represented and prepared for the use of case description, indexing (determining the significant features of a new problem), case similarity and case adaptation. This is a part of domain specific background knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Each event is described by an information entity (IE), while a case is a chain of such information entities. Cases may overlap in their components, hence a case base is thought of as a net with IE-nodes and case nodes, which we call a Case Retrieval Net (cf. <ref> [3] </ref> in this collection, [6]). IE-nodes are connected by weighted "similarity-arcs": An activated IE-node can propagate activity via these arcs to other IE-nodes (denoting similar events). Thus, an initial activation of some IE-nodes (which are relevant for a query) can be propagated through the net to other IE-nodes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Diagnosis is a task which usually needs a lot of (human) experience. Hence it is considered as a domain, where CBR can be applied with great benefits. The following reasons are listed in the article <ref> [5] </ref>: * Experiences play a major role in nearly every domain.

Reference-contexts: This is a part of domain specific background knowledge. Knowledge about the concrete plant : The concepts have to be represented, and their relations (e.g. part-of, is-a) have to be explained (e.g. by a system like LOOM <ref> [7] </ref>). Furthermore, concrete functions and dependencies of the plant are described (using the terms of the com mon sense and the background knowledge, too) Linguistic knowledge: Some kind of linguistic knowledge is already part of other components (explanation of related concepts etc.).
