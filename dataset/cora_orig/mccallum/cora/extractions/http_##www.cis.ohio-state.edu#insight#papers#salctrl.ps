Abstract: Many important physical phenomena, such as temperature distribution, air flow, and acoustic waves, are described as continuous, distributed parameter fields. Controlling and optimizing these physical processes and systems are common design tasks in many scientific and engineering domains. However, the challenges are multifold: distributed fields are conceptually harder to reason about than lumped parameter models; computational methods are prohibitively expensive for complex spatial domains; the underlying physics imposes severe constraints on observability and controllability. This paper develops an ontological abstraction and an aggregation-disaggregation mechanism, in a framework collectively known as spatial aggregation (SA), for reasoning about and synthesizing distributed control schemes for physical fields. The ontological abstraction models physical fields as networks of spatial objects. The aggregation-disaggregation mechanism employs a set of data types and generic operators to find a feasible control structure, specifying control placement and associated actions that satisfy given constraints. SA abstracts common computational patterns of control design and optimization in a small number of operators to support modular programming; it builds concise and articulable structural descriptions for physical fields. We illustrate the use of the SA ontological abstraction and operators in an example of regulating a thermal field in industrial heat treatment.

Reference-contexts: Because of the rapid advance in micro-fabrication technology that can integrate and produce micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) devices on a massive scale, we are becoming increasingly reliant on large networks of sensors, actuators, and computational elements to augment our ability to interact with and control the physical environment <ref> (Berlin 1994) </ref>. However, there is enormous challenge in controlling and optimizing physical fields using networks of sensors and controllers. The difficulties arise from three sources. First, a distributed parameter field is conceptually harder to reason about and model than a lumped parameter system such as a circuit.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Bradley and Zhao presented several methods for synthesizing nonlinear control laws in phase spaces (Bradley & Zhao 1993); their methods partition phase spaces into manageable subspaces. SA can also describe adaptive aggregation in dynamic programming where states and their dependencies are grouped into meta-states according to residual errors <ref> (Bertsekas & Castanon 1989) </ref>. We have described steady-state control problems for a class of physical fields such as heat conduction, gravity, electrostatics, and incompressible fluid flow that are governed by elliptic partial differential equations.

In comparison to the above work, the SA framework focuses on structure recovery and control of spatial fields. It differs from relaxation labeling in that SA builds multi-layer spatial aggregates to exploit a variety of spatial and temporal constraints.

Reference-contexts: Unlike control design for lumped parameter linear systems, few analytic design techniques have been developed for distributed control of large physical fields <ref> (Sandell Jr. et al. 1978) </ref>. In practice, the design is often accomplished by brute-force numerical simulations. SA offers a powerful modeling framework and an alternative mechanism for synthesizing decentralized control. The multi-resolutional SA model is particularly useful for formulating structural design problems that are not well addressed by numerical methods.

Reference-contexts: Second, numerical methods developed for designing and controlling physical fields require solving large systems of equations and hence are prohibitively expensive for large, irregular geometric domains and highly non-uniform, nonlinear phenomena. Third, physical laws constrain the ability of spatially distributed, local agents to sense and affect the environment <ref> (Seidman 1996) </ref>. Local sensors and control elements measure and interact with small neighborhoods around them. Macroscopic consequences are aggregated from local actions.

Reference-contexts: An even more advanced strategy interleaves aggregation and disaggregation so as to exploit the advantages of both. The spatial aggregation language provides aggregate, classify, and redescribe operators for hierarchically building source aggregates <ref> (Bailey-Kellogg, Zhao, & Yip 1996) </ref>. For brevity, we omit the code for aggregation-based design, concentrating instead on the disaggregation-based approach. and disaggregating unsatisfactory sources. To disag-gregate a source, multiple possible disaggregations are considered, and the one with the best error profile is chosen.
