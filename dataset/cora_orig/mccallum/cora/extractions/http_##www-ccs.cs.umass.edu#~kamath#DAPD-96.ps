Title: Exotica/FMDC: Handling Disconnected Clients in a Workflow Management System

Abstract: Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) are a first generation of products that attempt to manage the execution of business processes by large numbers of users distributed over a wide area and using heterogeneous resources. They are a very promising venue for collaborative systems but, in most cases, the autonomy of the users is greatly restricted due to architectural and design considerations. This is a severe restriction, especially when considering the emergence of mobile computing, and the increase in use of laptops and small computers which are connected to a network only occasionally. In this paper, we discuss how disconnected workflow clients can be supported while preserving the correctness of the overall execution and allowing coordinated interactions between the different users. Disconnected client support provides a great deal of flexibility in the usability of a WFMS and enhances the system's resilience to failures.

Reference-contexts: Recently, several proposals for distributed work-flow management architectures have been made that address the issue of disconnected and unavail 10 able clients. In Exotica/FMQM <ref> [AAE + 94] </ref> and in the architecture discussed for the INCA model [BMR94], there is no central node that controls the execution of a workflow process.

Reference-contexts: However, the use of a workflow management system simplifies to a great extent the task of coordinating large numbers of users working on heterogeneous and distributed environments. Most WFMSs are based on a client-server architecture <ref> [AKA + 94] </ref> in which, though individual steps may be executed at geographically distributed nodes, the knowledge about the processes being executed is kept in a centralized database at the server. This centralization makes it easier to synchronize and monitor the overall execution.

Reference-contexts: Recently, several proposals for distributed work-flow management architectures have been made that address the issue of disconnected and unavail 10 able clients. In Exotica/FMQM [AAE + 94] and in the architecture discussed for the INCA model <ref> [BMR94] </ref>, there is no central node that controls the execution of a workflow process. Workflow control and the current status of workflows are distributed across a number processing nodes, which are considered to be disconnected or unavailable quite frequently.

Reference-contexts: Instead of putting the activity on a shared worklist or putting it on the individual worklists of multiple users like FlowMark does it, the activity is send to the worklist of a specific user. Hence, user flexibility to share the workload is lost. Bussler <ref> [Bus95] </ref> has recently proposed a system to support mobile clients in a workflow environment. This system requires the workflow designer to specify whether an activity can be executed in disconnected mode.

Reference-contexts: automatic execution is not allowed, and the program execution client must be able to deal with all the information about activities, containers and navigation, effectively performing the same task as the server and the database. 4 Related Work There is a considerable amount of reserach in the area of workflow <ref> [She94, Hsu93, GHM + 93, TAC + 93, WR92, DHL91] </ref>, however, both in research and in commercial systems, the issue of disconnected client support has not been fully addressed.

Reference-contexts: These containers also include the application to be invoked, that must be installed in the client by the WFMS before disconnection occurs. In addition to the above research projects, there are currently more than 70 products that claim to be workflow solutions <ref> [Fry94] </ref>. Many of these systems use store and forward messaging, since they are based on Lotus Notes or on e-mail. Some of them might claim themselves to support disconnected clients, however, they do not provide the full functionality of a real workflow system.

Reference-contexts: This mode of operation has been widely acknowledged as one of the main ways in which computers will be used in the future <ref> [IB94] </ref>. Note that this includes not only mobile terminals but also desktops or any other computer type connected to the server only occasionally via a modem. Disconnected operation greatly expands the scope of an organization's distributed computing infrastructure with an obvious benefit. <p> As stated in <ref> [IB94] </ref>, there is a tremendous potential in combining these technologies since it could provide an entire new outlook to cooperative workflow systems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces FlowMark and discusses its client-server architecture. <p> However, support for downloading a set of activities is not provided, although our approach could easily be adopted in this system. 5 Discussion The importance of disconnected operation in work-flow environments has been pointed out elsewhere <ref> [IB94] </ref>, however little has been done until now to analyze and determine its requirements and limitations. We have proposed a design for disconnected clients that is based on an existing work-flow management system and that takes into account the collaborative aspects of the technology.

Reference-contexts: These systems either do not support roles at all or role resolution is already done at the time the next activity is ready to send. As a consequence, each activity appears on the worklist of a single user, only. In more elaborated systems like X-Workflow from Olivetti <ref> [Oli94] </ref>, a central mediator controls the control and data flow of a business process by distributing semi-structured e-mail messages to all users eligible to execute an activity.
