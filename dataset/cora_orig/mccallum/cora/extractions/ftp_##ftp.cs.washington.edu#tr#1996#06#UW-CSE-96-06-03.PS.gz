Abstract: The traditional definition of planning in the field of artificial intelligence provides only a very narrow notion of plan quality, namely that a plan is good just in case it achieves a specified goal. For many applications, this black-or-white notion of quality is insufficiently expressive. This dissertations extends the definition of planning to provide a much richer conception of plan quality. We propose that a planning problem should be posed in terms of a decision-theoretic value function, and that planning should be seen as an optimization process. We present Pyrrhus, a planning system which uses a branch-and-bound technique to find optimal plans for a class of goal-directed value functions which is strictly more expressive than the kind of goal formulas used by classical planning. Such value functions allow one to express not just one's goals, but also how important those goals are, ways in which they may be partially achieved, and the worth of resources that may be consumed by a plan. We empirically explore issues of heuristic control that arise during the planning process, and compare the difficulty of value-directed planning to comparable classical planning problems.

Reference-contexts: metric effects describe the change in the levels of attributes. 3 Since an action schema represents 2 Disjunctive preconditions can be accomplished by duplicating the action schema for each disjunct. 3 There has been a significant body of work dedicated to the support of metric resources in planning systems (e.g. <ref> [Wilkins 88, Currie&Tate 91, Penberthy 93, Lansky&Philpot 94] </ref>. Pyrrhus does not constitute a significant advance in this area; many existing systems provide much richer representations for the production and consumption of metric resources. But, since metric attributes are central to the notion of plan quality, we deem them necessary.

Reference-contexts: As one might expect, more expressive frameworks make the problem more difficult. However even under very strong limitations on the problem representation, planning is still quite difficult (e.g. PSPACE-complete) <ref> [Erol et al. 92] </ref>. * Algorithmic Given the theoretical results, we cannot expect planning algorithms to be able to tractably solve all possible problems.

Reference-contexts: An overview of the major components of Pyrrhus, and their relationship, is shown in Figure 1.4. (The numbers in brackets are the chapters in which those modules are described.) Pyrrhus supports two different representations for value functions based on Had-dawy and Hanks' theory of goal-directed utility models <ref> [Haddawy&Hanks 93] </ref>. These value functions allow the representation of partially-satisfiable deadline goals and partially-satisfiable conjunctive goals. They also allow the expression of non-goal preferences in terms of resources that a plan might consume or produce.

Reference-contexts: For purposes of empirical comparison, Pyrrhus also includes SatisPlan, a classical, goal-satisfying planning algorithm for r-strips.
