Abstract: This paper examines the spatial resolution properties of penalized maximum-likelihood image reconstruction methods by analyzing the local impulse response. We show that for emission image reconstruction using the ordinary uniform quadratic regularization penalty, the local impulse response is spatially variant. Paradoxically, the local resolution is poorest in high activity regions. The analysis leads naturally to a modified quadratic regularization penalty that achieves nearly uniform resolution. The modified penalty also provides a very practical method for choosing the smoothing parameter to obtain a specified resolution.

Reference-contexts: If the geometric response G of the imaging system is approximately spatially-invariant, then (19) implies that the impulse response will also be approximately spatially invariant, i.e. the resolution will be uniform. In <ref> [12] </ref> we provide empirical results that confirm that, despite the many approximations in our development, the modified penalty function greatly improves the resolution uniformity of penalized maximum likelihood image reconstruction.
