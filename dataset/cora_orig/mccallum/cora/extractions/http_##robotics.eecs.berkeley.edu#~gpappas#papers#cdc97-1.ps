Abstract: In an effort to increase the efficiency and safety of air travel while accommodating the growing demand for air traffic, the aviation community is working towards designing next generation Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems. ATM will replace the completely centralized, ground based, Air Traffic Control procedures. Within ATM, the concept of Free Flight allows each aircraft to plan four dimensional trajectories in real time, thus replacing the rigid and inefficient discrete airspace structure. These changes are feasible due to GPS and various other technological innovations. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ATM architecture, where much of the current ATC functionality is moved on board each aircraft. Within this framework, we present various issues that arise in the emerging area of hybrid systems based on our work in conflict resolution strategies between aircraft, and in flight mode switching logic.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Air transportation systems are faced with soaring demands for air travel. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the annual air traffic rate in the U.S. is expected to grow by 3 to 5 percent annually for at least the next 15 years <ref> [1] </ref>. The current National Airspace System (NAS) architecture and management will not be able to efficiently handle this increase because of several limiting factors including inefficient airspace utilization, increased Air Traffic Control (ATC) workload, and obsolete technology.

Reference-contexts: In view of the above problems and in an effort to meet the challenges of the next century, the aviation community is working towards an innovative concept called Free Flight <ref> [2] </ref>. Free Flight allows pilots to choose their own routes, altitude and speed and essentially gives each aircraft the freedom to self-optimize.

Reference-contexts: Direct great circle routes, optimal altitudes, optimal avoidance of developing weather hazards and utilization of favorable winds will result in fuel burn and flight time operating cost savings. Free Flight is potentially feasible because of enabling technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Datalink communications <ref> [3] </ref>, Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) [3], Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) [4] and powerful on-board computation. The technological advances will also enable air traffic controllers to accommodate future air traffic growth by restructuring NAS towards a more decentralized architecture. <p> Free Flight is potentially feasible because of enabling technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Datalink communications <ref> [3] </ref>, Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) [3], Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) [4] and powerful on-board computation. The technological advances will also enable air traffic controllers to accommodate future air traffic growth by restructuring NAS towards a more decentralized architecture. The current system is extremely centralized with ATC assuming most of the workload.

Reference-contexts: Coastal Centers have jurisdiction over oceanic waters. Around large urban airports there are Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities (TRACONs) numbering over 150. The TRA-CONs are supported by control towers at more than 400 airports. The overall system is referred to as National Airspace System (NAS) <ref> [5] </ref>. The main goal of both the ARTCCs and the TRA-CONs is to maintain safe separation between aircraft while guiding them to their destinations.

Reference-contexts: In an effort to increase the runway throughput, airport capacity as well as reduce delays, fuel consumption and controller workload in the vicinity of highly congested urban airports, NASA has designed the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) <ref> [6] </ref>. CTAS is a collection of planning and control functions which generate advisories to assist, but not replace, the controllers in handling traffic in the Center and TRACON areas.

Reference-contexts: CTAS is currently being field tested at Denver and Dallas-Fort Worth. A similar ground system called User Request Evaluation Tool (URET) has been developed by MITRE Corp. <ref> [7] </ref> and is being field tested at Indianapolis. Currently, nominal trajectories through the airspace are defined in terms of waypoints, which are fixed points in the airspace defined by VOR (VHF OmniDirectional Range) points on the ground.

Reference-contexts: In Center airspace, the strategic planners of all aircraft involved in the potential conflict determine a sequence of maneuvers which will result in conflict-free trajectories, either using communication with each other through satellite datalink, or by calculating safe trajectories assuming the worst possible actions of the other aircraft <ref> [8] </ref>. Each strategic planner sends its most recently designed trajectory to the Tactical Planner in the form of a sequence of control points and/or a maneuver. <p> In our research, we differentiate between two types of conflict resolution: noncooperative and cooperative <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The flight modes represent different modes of operation of the aircraft and correspond to controlling different variables in the aircraft dynamics. A derivation of the flight mode logic necessary for safe operation of a CTOL (Conventional Take Off and Landing) aircraft is presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. The resulting trajectory, denoted y d , x d , and u d in Figure 1, is given to the regulation layer which directly controls the aircraft. The task of the trajectory planner is complicated by the presence of non-minimum phase dynamics [10], [11] and actuator saturation [12]. <p> Due to the complexity of the overall system and very nonlinear nature of the continuous dynamics it is unlikely that timed automata techniques will be adequate in this setting. More elaborate (possibly hybrid) techniques, such as those in <ref> [9] </ref> may be useful here. In addition, higher level of the hierarchy, utilize coarser system models or coarser abstractions. This raises the interesting notions of consistent abstractions or implementability, which is the ability of a lower level system to execute the commands of a higher level system. <p> Flight modes also exist in order to ensure safe aircraft operation. Each aircraft has various flight envelopes, or state constraints, which ensure safe and comfortable aircraft operation. In order to respect these constraints the aircraft may switch mode in order to remain within the envelope. For example in <ref> [9] </ref>, one of the goals of the FMS is to keep the state of the aircraft in a given subset of the state space dictated in principle by stall constraints. The task is complicated by input saturation which also dictates the flight mode switching.

Such hybrid phenomena arise, for example, from the coordination between aircraft at the strategic level when resolving a potential conflict.

Reference-contexts: In more complicated conflict scenario involving many aircraft, the design of the protocol is not obvious. In order to assist with the protocol design, we employ the method of potential fields which generate the resolution maneuvers <ref> [19] </ref>. These maneuvers are then discretized and modeled as linear hybrid automata. Computer aided verification techniques from computer science are then used in order to calculate the safe sets of initial conditions.
