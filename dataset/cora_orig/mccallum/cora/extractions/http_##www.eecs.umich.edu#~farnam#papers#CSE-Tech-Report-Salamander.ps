Abstract: The Salamander distribution system is a wide-area network data dissemination substrate that has been used daily for over a year by several groupware and webcasting Internet applications. Specifically, Salamander is designed to support push-based applications using attribute-based routing. This support provides a variety of delivery semantics ranging from basic data delivery, used by the Internet Performance Measurement and Analysis (IPMA) project, to collaborative group communication used by the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (UARC) project. The Salamander substrate combines both extensible text-based attribute routing with a version of tag switching to achieve high data throughputs. Moreover, the substrate is designed to accommodate the large variation in Internet connectivity and client resources through the use of application-specific plug-in modules. These modules provide a means for placing application functionality throughout the distribution network, thereby allowing the application to respond to network and processor resource constraints near their bottlenecks. The delivery substrate can be tailored by an application for use with a heterogeneous set of clients. For example the IPMA and UARC projects send and receive data from: Java applets and applications; Perl, C and C++ applications; and Unix and Windows 95/NT clients. This paper illustrates the architecture and design of the Salamander system driven by the needs of its set of current applications. The main architectural features described include: the attribute-based data routing mechanism, persistent data queries, negotiated push-technology, support for Application-level Quality of Service policies, and a lightweight temporal database.

Reference-contexts: In [7], Fox et.al. provide a general proxy architecture for dynamic distillation of data at the server. The use of hierarchically encoded data distributed over several multicast groups is discussed in [16] for the delivery of different qualities of audio and video data. Balachandran et.al target mobile computing in <ref> [1] </ref> and argue for adding active filters at base stations. Active network proponents [20] argue that Internet routers should be enabled to run arbitrary application-level code to assist in protocol processing.

Reference-contexts: A further optimization for space savings could be made by only keeping frequently used virtual channels' forwarding sets in memory. The mapping between an incoming data object's attribute set and its corresponding node in the forwarding graph is done using a form of tag switching <ref> [17, 2] </ref>. Initially, when a server sees a data object on an unknown virtual channel, it generates a tag for the channel and inserts it into both the forwarding graph and a hash table. This hash table maps the tag to the appropriate node in the forwarding graph.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea in anonymous push is that publishers package opaque data objects, or Application Data Units as termed in <ref> [3] </ref>, with text-based attribute lists. Subscribers place persistent queries to the Salamander substrate using lists of attribute expressions that can be used to match both current and future objects published to the Salamander space as described above. <p> Groups can stay anonymous where the suppliers have no knowledge of the receivers, or they can become more explicit where the suppliers keep a tally of their receivers. A persistent disk-based cache of data objects, in conjunction with the use of application level framing <ref> [3] </ref>, can be used to provide high-level delivery semantics. This includes: FIFO, causal, ordered atomic, etc [8]. 4 Salamander Interfaces There are two interfaces to the Salamander substrate: the application programmer interface (API) and the administration interface. The API has several layers and implementations, depending on the developer's needs.

Reference-contexts: Since the analysis of data in these experiments relies on this distributed timestamp information, a method for synchronizing the clocks on an experiment's hosts was applied. To compensate for the difference in the clocks, a probabilistic clock synchronization technique, similar to the protocols developed by Cristian <ref> [5] </ref> was used. 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 280 Number of receivers. 0.01 1.00 100.00 Mean latency (sec) 0 byte payload 1 Kbyte payload 10 Kbyte payload terms of both number of concurrent receivers and size of the data payload.

Reference-contexts: Extending netnews, the SIFT tool [23] has been used to redistribute netnews articles based on text-based user profiles. At a lower level the combination of native IP multicast support and specific Mbone <ref> [6] </ref> routers provides a mechanism for the dissemination of IP datagrams throughout portions of the Internet. Multicast datagrams are pushed based on a single attribute, namely the IP multicast group address. Recently, many commercial push-based companies have started: BackWeb, IFusion, InCommon, Inter-mind, Marimba, NETdelivery, PointCast, and Wayfarer. <p> Applet development has progressed for over a year and a half on the UARC project, and Web browsers are the de facto subscriber platform. In the absence of multicast support in Java 1.0.2, and the lack of universal Mbone <ref> [6] </ref> connectivity, the decision was made to create our own distribution topology using Salamander servers in place of existing Mbone infrastructure.

The use of hierarchically encoded data distributed over several multicast groups is discussed in [16] for the delivery of different qualities of audio and video data.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows several different data feeds displayed during a real-time campaign. The second project that uses Salamander is the Internet Performance Measurement and Analysis (IPMA) project <ref> [9] </ref>, a joint effort of the University of Michigan and Merit Network. The IPMA project collects a variety of network and interdomain performance and routing statistics at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), internal ISP backbones, and campus LAN/WAN borders. <p> These tasks include: acting as the data collection mechanism for the NetNow probes at the Internet Exchange Points, and as the webcasting delivery mechanism from a central server tree to a collection of Java applets available from its website <ref> [9] </ref>. The UARC project has gone through several week-long campaigns using Salamander as the data distribution substrate that connects the remote instrument sites to the scientists' Java applets. During these campaigns over sixty scientists have had multiple connections receiving many different types of data.

Reference-contexts: Although the terminology is relatively new, Push technologies have been around for many years. The seminal push technology is electronic mail. Email has been pushed from publisher to subscribers for decades through mailing lists. Moreover, USENET news <ref> [10] </ref> has been used to push data objects (articles) based on text attributes (group names). Extending netnews, the SIFT tool [23] has been used to redistribute netnews articles based on text-based user profiles.

Reference-contexts: In general, it supports a wide and extensible variety of application specific data flows. These flows can be addressed by an arbitrary hierarchy of channels that can be defined and dynamically extended by the application. This extensibility is lacking in fixed width integer-based approaches to data stream delivery <ref> [11] </ref>. The mapping of arbitrary length strings to integer tags provides for both extensibility and performance. 3.2 Channel Subscription Service The Salamander substrate provides an abstraction for the distribution of data from publishers to subscribers through its channel subscription interface with both anonymous and negotiated push techniques.

Reference-contexts: Both of these laboratories consist of Ultrasparc-1 140 workstations connected by 10 Mbps Ethernet LANs. During the experiments the single server and thirty of these laboratory workstations were controlled by an expect script <ref> [12] </ref>. The performance experiments highlight the scalability of the server in several dimensions: the number of simultaneous connections, and a throughput metric of objects per second. Both of these experiments characterize the substrate's performance in terms of a data object's end-to-end latency from a data supplier to a receiving client.

Reference-contexts: When two servers are initially connected, they exchange their knowledge of virtual channels and tags with one another. Together this sharing of mappings along with an incremental approach to channel availability dissemination is very similar to the incremental routing algorithm used in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 C = 5 X 1 To illustrate the use of tag switching in forwarding virtual channel data refer to Figure 5. This figure shows a portion of an example topology where two servers (1 and 2) have installed different tags for the same 6 channel C.

Reference-contexts: In this way, clients can maintain membership information within their groups. 3.3 Application-Level Quality of Service The Salamander architecture provides application-level Quality of Service policies to deliver data to clients as best fits their connectivity and processing resources <ref> [14] </ref>. These policies can rely on either best effort service or utilize network-level QoS guarantees [24] if available.

Reference-contexts: The Salamander data distribution substrate provides the systems support needed for two of these applications: groupware and webcasting. Participants in these wide-area distributed applications vary in their hardware resources, software support and quality of connectivity <ref> [15] </ref>. In an environment such as the Internet they are connected by network links with highly variable bandwidth, latency, and loss characteristics. In fact, the explosive growth of the Internet and the proliferation of intelligent devices is widening an already large gap between these members.

Reference-contexts: This database supports Salamander's needs by: storing a virtual channel's data as a sequence of write-once updates that are primarily based on time; and satisfying requests for data based on temporal ranges within the update stream. A temporal database <ref> [19] </ref> generally views a single data record as an ordered sequence of temporally bounded updates. In the Salamander database these records correspond to virtual channels. An administrator can determine which sets of virtual channels will be archived by the system.

This bandwidth was measured both informally using ftp latency and rigorously with the treno tool <ref> [21] </ref>. This explains the steep rise in the 10 Kbyte payloads between 40 and 50 receivers, that corresponds to 400 Kbytes and 500 Kbytes per second respectively.
