Abstract: This paper describes a new approach to layout compaction of analog integrated circuits which respects all of the performance and technology constraints necessary to guarantee proper analog circuit functionality. Our approach consists of two stages: a fast constraint graph critical path algorithm followed by a general linear programming algorithm. Circuit performance is guaranteed by mapping high-level performance constraints to low-level bounds on parasitics and then to minimum spacing constraints between adjacent nets.

Reference-contexts: Topological constraints and performance constraints are essential because analog circuit performances are extremely sensitive to parasitics. Variations in device symmetries (topological constraints) or interconnect length (performance constraints), for example, affect cross-coupling capacitances and stray resistances, which can dramatically degrade circuit performance. The symbolic layout compaction problem is NP-hard <ref> [1] </ref>. However, heuristics have been developed which provide good quality layouts. In particular, the use of mono-dimensional compaction phases alternately performed in orthogonal directions is one of the most popular approaches. <p> Special care must be taken during the compaction step to insure that those symmetries are preserved. 3. ALGORITHM 3.1. Technology Constraints If only technology constraints are considered, mono-dimensionalcompaction can be solved efficiently with the constraint graph longest path algorithm [10] <ref> [1, Ch. 10] </ref>. The pattern of component connectivity and minimum separations required by the technology is described as a weighted, directed graph. Each component is represented in the graph by a node.

Reference-contexts: However, not all analog circuit constraints can be expressed in a form which can be solved by a constraint-graph algorithm. Several approaches to specific portions of the general analog compaction problem have been previously described. In <ref> [2] </ref> symmetries are enforced by using an iterative graph perturbation technique. Unfortunately false overcon-straints frequently arise with this approach because of the order in which the symmetric objects are processed, especially when multiple symmetry axes are present. In [3] a linear programming (LP) algorithm was proposed.

Reference-contexts: In [2] symmetries are enforced by using an iterative graph perturbation technique. Unfortunately false overcon-straints frequently arise with this approach because of the order in which the symmetric objects are processed, especially when multiple symmetry axes are present. In <ref> [3] </ref> a linear programming (LP) algorithm was proposed. Objects not directly interacting with symmetric items in the layout are collapsed, thus generating super-constraints which are solved using linear programming. This technique is particularly appropriate when hierarchical compaction is performed [4]. <p> The use of the graph solution obtained in step 2 as the starting point for the LP solver in step 3 is the key to obtaining a significant speed-up in the solution of the LP, compared to previous approaches using pure LP <ref> [3] </ref>. In most observed practical cases the configuration yielded by step 2 is close enough to the final solution to require the LP solver to carry out only a small number of steps, yielding 20% to 50% reductions in cpu time over pure LP algorithms.

Objects not directly interacting with symmetric items in the layout are collapsed, thus generating super-constraints which are solved using linear programming. This technique is particularly appropriate when hierarchical compaction is performed <ref> [4] </ref>. Even after reducing the set of constraints considered in the LP problem, however, this algorithm is severely limited in the maximum circuit complexity which can be considered and in the classes of constraints which can be accommodated.

Reference-contexts: This technique is particularly appropriate when hierarchical compaction is performed [4]. Even after reducing the set of constraints considered in the LP problem, however, this algorithm is severely limited in the maximum circuit complexity which can be considered and in the classes of constraints which can be accommodated. In <ref> [5] </ref> symmetries are enforced with a combination graph and LP algorithm which uses constraint graph longest path techniques to arrive at a good starting point for an LP solver. <p> In this paper we propose an efficient approach to symbolic compaction which accounts for all analog constraints. The size and complexity of the circuits with which it can cope are large enough to make the algorithm suitable for industrial-strength applications. The work presented in <ref> [5] </ref> served as a basis for the results presented here, with the primary contributions of this paper being: 1) a new aggressive technique for controlling parasitics and 2) an original technique for global wire length minimization. Our approach is part of a general top-down, constraint-driven analog circuit design methodology [6]. <p> The range of cases that can be managed with acceptable computational complexity is therefore significantly expanded. The details of using the constraint graph and LP solver together to enforce symmetries are reported in <ref> [5] </ref>. With an LP solver it is also possible to perform global wire length minimization, which is described in section 4.5. 2. <p> Under these conditions the optimum solution to the LP problem contains only integer coordinates <ref> [5] </ref>. The LP solver used in this implementation is a simplex algorithm which finds the optimum solution by sequentially visiting the vertices of the polytope bounding the feasible region.

Reference-contexts: This methodology has been successfully used for placement <ref> [7] </ref> and routing [8, 9]. In this paper we extend the same methodology to compaction, thus ensuring that the results obtained from constraint-driven placement and routing are not spoiled during compaction. Not using constraint-driven compaction would cause the whole methodology to fail by permitting uncontrolled constraint violations.

Reference-contexts: A simple plane sweep algorithm is used to generate the minimum spacing constraints. The longest path in this graph provides the minimum width (height). 3.2. Coupling Constraints High-level performance specifications can be mapped efficiently onto a set of low-level bounds on parasitics <ref> [11] </ref>. If every parasitic is kept below its bound, all performance constraints are guaranteed to be met. Bounds are set so as to be feasible, on the basis of reasonable estimates of parasitic values drawn from analysis of the layout.

Reference-contexts: While not required by the analog design methodology, optimizing on this secondary objective improves circuit performance by further reducing wire resistances and parasitic capacitances. One alternative approach <ref> [12] </ref> performs heuristic local wire length minimization, but no previous approach addresses the issue of global wire length minimization. This important secondary optimization is only possible in this implementation because of the use of the LP solver as a post-processor of the constraint-graph solution. 5.
