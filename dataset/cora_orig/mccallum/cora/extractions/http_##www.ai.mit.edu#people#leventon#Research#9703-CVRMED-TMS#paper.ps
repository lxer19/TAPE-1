Abstract: We describe functional brain mapping experiments using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device. This device, when placed on a subject's scalp, stimulates the underlying neurons by generating focused magnetic field pulses. A brain mapping is then generated by measuring responses of different motor and sensory functions to this stimulation. The key process in generating this mapping is the association of the 3D positions and orientations of the TMS probe on the scalp to a 3D brain reconstruction such as is feasible with a magnetic resonance image (MRI). We have developed a system which not only generates functional brain maps using such a device, but also provides real-time feedback to guide the technician in placing the probe at appropriate points on the head for achieving the desired map resolution. Functional areas we have mapped are the motor and visual cortex. Validation experiments to date have consisted of repeatability and symmetry tests for mapping the same subjects several times. Applications of the technique include neuranatomy research, surgical planning and guidance, treatment and disease monitoring, and therapeutic procedures.

Reference-contexts: Thus the overall accuracy, including any tracking errors, should be within about 1 2mm, which is generally not much larger than the voxel resolution of the MRI scan.

Reference-contexts: Such guidance avoids redundant probings, reduces acquisition time, and supports accurate delineation of "hot spot" boundaries. 2 FUNCTIONAL MAPPING SYSTEM 2 In <ref> [4] </ref> we reported preliminary results of applying a TMS system to mapping the motor cortex. We have since extended the capabilities of the system to simplify the mapping process by providing real-time status feedback, thus allowing us to map a larger number of subjects. <p> Thus the overall accuracy, including any tracking errors, should be within about 1 2mm, which is generally not much larger than the voxel resolution of the MRI scan.

Peliz-zari et al <ref> [12] </ref> have developed a method that matches retrospective data sets, (MRI, CT, PET), to one another. This work also uses a least squares minimization of distances between data sets, although with a different distance function and with more operator guidance required.

Reference-contexts: By starting with large we achieve a large region of convergence and by gradually decreasing the value of we lock in on the well-localized minimum. In order to minimize this evaluation function we use the Davidon Fletcher-Powell (DFP) quasi-Newton method <ref> [13] </ref>. As a final step we use a rectified least squares distance measure to ensure we've reached an optimal solution and to derive an easily interpreted error measure.

One goal of their work was to register MRI/CT data with PET data to obtain functional mappings. Lavallee and Szeliski <ref> [15] </ref> also perform a least-squares minimization of a distance function to match data sets. Here, the distance is weighted by an estimate of the inverse variance of the measurement noise, and the Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to find the minimum.
