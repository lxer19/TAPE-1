Abstract: In this paper the problem of complexity of multiplication of a matrix with a vector is studied for Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde and Cauchy matrices and for matrices connected with them (i.e. for transpose, inverse and transpose to inverse matrices). The proposed algorithms have complexities at most O(n log 2 n) flops and in a number of cases improve the known estimates. In these algorithms, in a separate preprocessing phase, are singled out all the actions on the preparation of a given matrix, which aimed at the reduction of the complexity of the second stage of computations directly connected with the multiplication by an arbitrary vector. Incidentally, the effective algorithms for computing the Vandermonde determinant and the determinant of a Cauchy matrix, are given.

Denote by o (n) the complexity of solving one equation of the form (1.2).

According to Brent, Gustavson and Yun (1980), de Hoog (1987), Chun and Kailath (1991) Thus, if matrix A 2 C nfin is the inverse of the given Toeplitz matrix, then from the above arguments follows that after 2o (n) + 8OE (n) flops preprocessing the product of A by an arbitrary vector can be computed by (1.3) in 16OE (n) <p> Application to the vector.

Moreover, this algorithm does not restrict itself to Cauchy matrices and is valid for more general classes of matrices.

Reference-contexts: Formula (1.4) was obtained in Ammar and Gader (1990) for positive definite Toeplitz matrices and ' = 1; = 1, and was extended to the general case in Gohberg and Olshevsky <ref> (1992) </ref>. Note, in the latter paper one can also find other factor circulant decompositions for the inverses of Toeplitz matrices, which are useful in the fast computations with Toeplitz matrices.
