Reference-contexts: : HPSC Course Notes A Review of Selected Topics from Numerical Analysis fl Lloyd Fosdick December 30, 1994 The course "High-Performance Scientific Computing" assumes an introductory knowledge of numerical analysis such as you might gain from any of a number of textbooks; this includes the ones by Conte and deBoor <ref> [Conte & de Boor 80] </ref>, Dahlquist and Bjork [Dahlquist & Bjorck 74], or Ka-haner, Moler and Nash [Kahaner et al. 89]. These are referred to as CdB, DB, and KMN in the sequel. <p> There are also matrix norms consistent with the two vector norms k k 1 and k k 2 defined by equations (4) and (5). For more information on matrix norms, see <ref> [Conte & de Boor 80] </ref> or [Golub & Van Loan 89].

Reference-contexts: Many computers use the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic which is defined in the document An American National Standard & IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. It is informally described in the tutorial Elements of IEEE Arithmetic <ref> [Fosdick 94] </ref> 1 .

Reference-contexts: We do not discuss the FFT here, but it is worth pointing out that it takes advantage of the special structure of W . The elements of W 1 should be evident from this example. For more information on the FFT, see the Tomography tutorial <ref> [Jessup 94] </ref>. F is called the discrete Fourier transform of f , and f is called the inverse Fourier transform of F .

These are referred to as CdB, DB, and KMN in the sequel. The purpose of this review is simply to record definitions, formulas, and concepts you are expected to know; and to define the notation we will use.

Reference-contexts: For example, they may be written to show operations in terms of the columns of the matrix A instead of the rows of the matrix A. Such rearrangements are often helpful in devising efficient algorithms. For more information on alternative formulations, see, for example, <ref> [Strang 80] </ref>.
