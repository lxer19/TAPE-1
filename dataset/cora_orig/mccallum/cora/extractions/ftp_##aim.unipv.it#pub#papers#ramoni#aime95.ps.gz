Abstract: Bayesian Belief Networks (bbns) play a relevant role in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and they have been successfully applied to a wide variety of medical domains. An appealing character of bbns is that they easily extend into a complete decision-theoretic formalism known as Influence Diagrams (ids). Unfortunately, bbns and ids require a large amount of information that is not always easy to obtain either from human experts or from the statistical analysis of databases. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed a class of ids, called Ignorant Influence Diagrams (iids), able to reason on the basis of incomplete information and to to improve the accuracy of the decisions as a monotonically increasing function of the available information. The aim of this paper is show how iids can be useful to model medical decision making with incomplete information.

Reference-contexts: Since beliefs usually incorporate measures of certainty, several attempts have been made to include probabilities in tmss. tmss that are able to reason on the basis of probabilistic rather than binary truth values are called Belief Maintenance Systems (bmss) <ref> [3] </ref>.

A consumer is a forward-chained procedure attached to a proposition, that is fired when the truth-value of the proposition is changed. When a variable is defined in the ibn, for each proposition representing its states in the lbms, two different consumers are defined.

Reference-contexts: There are several criteria to rank convex sets of expected utilities. The most conservative criterion for ranking expected utilities is called Stochastic Dominance <ref> [6] </ref> and dictates that a strategy s i has to be preferred to a strategy s j if and only if U fl (s i ) &gt; U fl (s j ) (i.e. the intervals of the expected utilities do not overlap).

Reference-contexts: However, this criterion is unable to discriminate in a variety of decision situations. When the Stochastic Dominance criterion fails, we have to resort to a weaker condition of admissibility, able to discriminate among competing strategies when the expected utilities intervals are not disjoint <ref> [7] </ref>. This condition of admissibility is known as Hurwicz criterion. It suggests to rank the possible strategies according to a weighed average of their minimum and maximum expected utilities, using a constant ff , with 0 ff 1.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over the past 20 years, decision theory and analysis played a dominant role in the effort of modeling medical decision making, and they were successfully applied to a wide variety of difficult clinical problems <ref> [10] </ref>. It is therefore not surprising that decision analysis techniques have been deeply exploited by the attempts of mechanizing medical decision making: some of the pioneering work in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Medicine used Bayesian and decision-theoretic methods to develop medical diagnostic expert systems.

Reference-contexts: Most of this work has focused on the use of direct acyclic graphs to represent conditional dependencies among stochastic variables; the results of this efforts are the knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms known as Bayesian Belief Networks (bbns). The theory of bbns was summarized by Pearl <ref> [11] </ref>, but they have been independently developed by several researchers during the past few years. A bbn is a direct acyclic graph in which nodes represent stochastic variables and arcs represent conditional dependencies among the variables.
