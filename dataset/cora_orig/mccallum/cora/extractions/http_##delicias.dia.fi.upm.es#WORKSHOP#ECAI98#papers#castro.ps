Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to give tools to achieve negotiation to with more security and more freedom. The system that we built uses ontologies to describe the world of each negotiating agent and their communicative acts. When the agents are negotiating, the incoherent situations are used to cause agents to act. One of these actions is the ontology revision. We also tackle the problem of ontology fusion from a technical point of view. We use a problematic of the ontology building, under the framework of the different worlds (problem, solution, mediation), corresponding to the different roles of the actors of the interaction (locutor and interlocutor). Then, we will show the what the use of machine learning methods can bring to the ontology building.

Reference-contexts: A test is still in progress with geological data that permit the commercial exploitation of mineral water spring. A second application, named Hotel Booking Clerk, was proposed as a mockup of FIPA agents <ref> [FIP97] </ref>. It aims to be an informative application to specify the development of a Personal Travel Assistant Ontology. Two agents, a hotel booking clerk and a guest, are trying to connect problems (the guest wants a room) to solutions (an available room).

Reference-contexts: The sherpas second task is to prepare a future negotiation between the negotiators. 3 RATIONALITY AND PROBLEM SOL VING The principle of rationality takes the problem solving formalization from a behavioural point of view <ref> [Rus97] </ref> [Sim82]. Instead of giving general principles of construction of a world, it gives some principles of behaviour of agents. Agents are viewed as problem solvers influenced by their environments.
