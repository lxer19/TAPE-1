Abstract: The Scale transform is a new representation for signals, offering perspective different from the Fourier transform. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a scale periodic function. These functions are then represented through the discrete scale series. We also define the notion of a strictly scale limited signal. Analogous to the Shannon interpolation formula, we show that such signals can be exactly reconstructed from exponentially spaced samples of the signal in the time domain. As an interesting, practical application, we show how properties unique to the Scale transform make it very useful in computing depth maps of a scene.

Reference-contexts: That the discrete Fourier transform can be efficiently computed using the FFT algorithm, has also contributed to its popularity. A transform closely related to the Fourier transform is the Scale transform. The Scale transform was introduced by Cohen, in an operator theoretic framework <ref> [1] </ref>. In it, he defines a scale operator, and the corresponding eigen-functions which define the Scale transform. Uncertainty relations, notions of bandwidth, were also developed. The Scale transform has been shown to be related to the Fourier transform via an unitary transformation [5]. <p> Section 5 discusses a new technique for the computation of depth maps. 2 2 The Scale Transform A signal can be represented in a variety of ways, depending upon the attribute of the signal that we wish to emphasize. A transform defined in <ref> [1] </ref>, that is related via a unitary transformation to the Fourier transform is the Scale transform: f (t) = p Z 1 F (c) p dc (1) 1 2 0 e jc ln t t Where F (c) is defined to be the Scale transform of f (t). <p> Hence for arbitrary signals, the positive and the negative parts of the signal have to be treated separately. The function fl (c; t) = e jc ln t p 2t ; t 0 is actually the eigenfunction of the scale operator C <ref> [1] </ref>, defined as C = 2j d t + t dt : (3) Consider the following property of the Scale transform: f (fit) , p F (c)e jc ln fi : (4) Where F (c) is the Scale transform of f (t) and fi is a constant. <p> Where T is the fundamental period of the function. Fourier analysis, began as an attempt to represent such functions using sinusoids. The Scale transform was developed in an abstract operator theoretic framework <ref> [1] </ref>, and hence its usefulness in signal processing applications is not readily apparent. In order to appreciate the utility of the Scale transform, it is important to understand its origins. A class of signals, known as scale periodic signals leads naturally to the development of the Scale transform.

Reference-contexts: It can also be shown that in the limit t ! 1 that the discrete scale series tends to the Scale transform. The discrete scale series can be proven to be complete. The proof is similar in nature to the proof of completeness of the Fourier series <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 The Sampling Theorem Theorem: A function f (t) 2 L 2 (R) scale limited to C o can be exactly reconstructed (in the L 2 sense) from its samples in the time domain if the samples are spaced exponentially along the time axis as in ft n g 1
