Keyword: CR Category and Subject Descriptor: C.2.0 [Computer Systems Organization]: Computer-Communication Networks general; K.6.5 [Computing Milieux] Management of Computing and Information Systems security and protection General Terms: Management, Security, Standardization Additional Key Words: Corporate Network, OSI, Security Architecture

Abstract: The current, widespread use of computer networks has led to increased concerns about security. This paper deals with network security in general, and concentrates on corporate networks in particular. A method to develop security concepts for corporate networks is introduced, and stepwise refined.

Reference-contexts: A lot of research is actually being done in developping authentication and key distribution systems. Examples are Kerberos from MIT [SNS88], NetSP (former KryptoKnight) from IBM [MTVHZ92], SPX from DEC [TA91], and TESS from the European Institute for System Security (E.I.S.S.) <ref> [Bet91] </ref>. A Kerberos-like authentication system has been chosen by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) for its Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). Based on the key distribution functionality of an authentication system, data confidentiality, integrity, and non-repuiation services can be added straightforward.

Reference-contexts: Within a PKC each user holds a pair of keys, consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key can be given to anyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret <ref> [DH76] </ref>. With regard to OSI, it has to be distinguished, whether encipherment is being done in layer one or two (link encryption), or in a higher layer, typically the presentation or application layer (end-to-end encryption). With link encryption every trunk can use its own cryptosystem.

Reference-contexts: Security mechanisms need to be simple, cost-efficient, and secure. As a matter of fact, they have to be exchangeable; whenever better mechanisms are found or developped, they must be replaced. Security services and mechanisms are discussed in the following sections. The terminology of the OSI security architecture <ref> [ISO89] </ref> is needed for this discussion.

Reference-contexts: MACs protect the integrity of data units, they don't protect the integrity of data streams. Sequence numbers, and cryptological chaining can be used here. 4. Authentication exchange mechanisms are to provide entity authentication services. There are simple and strong authentication exchange mechanisms to be distinguished <ref> [ITU87] </ref>: Simple mechanisms depend on the transmission of some authentication information of a particular users, wheras strong mecha nisms are using cryptological protocols to hide this information. <p> The security of security mechanisms sometimes depend on the public availability of certain parameters, like public keys in a PKC. Notarization implies that these parameters can be certified and published by a trusted certification authority. ITU-T X.509 describes a hierarchical layering of certification authorities <ref> [ITU87] </ref>. 8. Access control mechanisms have to make sure that users can only access resources in a correct and predefined way. Discretionary and mandatory access controls are used in closed systems.

Reference-contexts: Authentication services are fundamental for any network; if authentication is not given, the discussion of further security services is useless. A lot of research is actually being done in developping authentication and key distribution systems. Examples are Kerberos from MIT [SNS88], NetSP (former KryptoKnight) from IBM <ref> [MTVHZ92] </ref>, SPX from DEC [TA91], and TESS from the European Institute for System Security (E.I.S.S.) [Bet91].

Reference-contexts: For long messages it is common to hash the message first, sign the result digitally, and send the message together with the digitally signed hash function result to the receiver. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published a Digital Signature Standard (DSS) back in 1991 <ref> [NIS91] </ref>. The discussion about this standard is not yet closed [RHA92]. 3. If the confidentiality of a message is protected through encipherment, its integrity is protected, too. But there are situations that require the unique protection of integrity.

Reference-contexts: Public services are offered in wide area networks; examples are leased lines, circuit switched lines, and services that are provided in packet switched data networks [OS94].
