Abstract: In mobile environments, a personal communication service (PCS) network must keep track of the location of each mobile user in order to correctly deliver calls. A basic scheme used in the standard IS-41 and GSM protocols is to always update the location of a mobile user whenever the mobile user moves to a new location. The problem with this approach is that the cost of location update operations is very high especially when the mobile user moves frequently. In recent years, various location management strategies for reducing the location update cost have been proposed. However, the performance issue of these proposed algorithms remains to be investigated. In this paper, we develop two Markov chains to analyze and compare the performance of two promising location update strategies, i.e., the two location algorithm (TLA) and the forwarding and resetting algorithm (FRA). By utilizing the Markov chain, we are able to quickly answer what-if questions regarding the performance of PCS networks under various workload conditions and also identify conditions under which one strategy can perform better than the others. Using the cost due to location update and search operations between two successive calls to a mobile user as a performance measure, we show that when the mobile user exhibits a high degree of locality and the mobile user's call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) is low, TLA can significantly outperform both FRA and IS-41. On the other hand, when CMR is high, FRA is the winner. Furthermore, unlike TLA which may perform worse than IS-41 at high CMR values, FRA at identified optimal conditions can always perform at least as good as IS-41, suggesting that FRA over TLA should be used as a generic scheme in reducing the location cost in the PCS network to cover all possible per-user CMR values.

Reference-contexts: Specific values of U , T and t above can be obtained by considering specific network coverage models (see for example <ref> [1] </ref>). In this paper, we fix the value of U at 1 as used in [7], but use different values of T and t to study their effects. Note that the range of T is between 0 to 0.5 since we fix U at 1.

Reference-contexts: A well known basic and simple scheme is to update the location of each mobile user as it moves to a new location. This scheme exists in IS-41 <ref> [2] </ref> in the United States and GSM [9] in Europe and is commonly known as the basic HLR/VLR location registration scheme. Under the basic HLR/VLR scheme, a mobile user is permanently registered under a location register called the home location register (HLR).

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows a hierarchical PCS network as discussed in <ref> [3] </ref> in which there is one HLR for each mobile user; the mobile user may go to different registration areas under different VLRs (marked R 0 , R 1 , R 2 , etc. in Figure 1). <p> When the frequency of the incoming calls is higher than the mobile user's mobility, that is, when call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) is high, the location cache scheme <ref> [3] </ref> is proposed to reduce the number of locating operations.

Reference-contexts: When CMR is low, on the other hand, it is reported that the forwarding and resetting algorithm (FRA) <ref> [4, 10] </ref>, the alternative location strategy (ALS) [12] and the two location algorithm (TLA) [7, 8] can be used to reduce the location update cost. <p> The time that a particular mobile user stays within a VLR before moving to another one, i.e., dwell time within a VLR, is characterized by an exponential distribution with an average rate of . Such a parameter can be estimated using the approach described in <ref> [4, 6] </ref> on a per user basis. The interarrival time between two consecutive calls to a particular mobile user, regardless of the current location of the user, is also assumed to be exponentially distributed with an average rate of .

Reference-contexts: This behavior is described by a hidden transition from state (1; i; j) back to itself with a transition rate of . This type of transition is not shown in Figure 2 since it does not need to be considered when solving a Markov chain <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that this implies that in state (1; i; j) the number of requests accumulated to locate the mobile user may be greater than one. <p> Therefore, there is no need to model the time needed to perform the registration operation in this case. 9 The Markov chain shown in Figure 2 is ergodic <ref> [5] </ref>, which means that all states have a non-zero probability. The probability that the system is found in a particular state in equilibrium depends on the relative magnitude of the outgoing and incoming transitions rates.

Recall that U corresponds to the basic search cost under IS-41. <p> The results correlate well with those reported in <ref> [7] </ref>. 16 outperform IS-41. For example, when CMR is 0.1 and is 0.3, TLA reduces 22% of the cost of IS-41; when CMR is 0.1 and is 0.7, TLA reduces the cost even further by 62%.
