Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 423 (submitted to ICCV'98) - April 1997 Abstract In this paper we develop a representation for the temporal structure inherent in human actions and demonstrate an effective method for using that representation to detect the occurrence of actions. The temporal structure of the action, sub-actions, events, and sensor information is described using a constraint network based on Allen's interval algebra. We map these networks onto a simpler, 3-valued domain (past,now,fut) network | a PNF-network | to allow fast detection of actions and sub-actions. The occurrence of an action is computed by considering the minimal domain of its PNF-network, under constraints imposed by the current state of the sensors and the previous states of the network. We illustrate the approach with examples, showing that a major advantage of PNF propagation is the detection and removal of situations inconsistent with the temporal structure of the action. We also examine a method to increase the robustness of

Reference-contexts: Kuniyoshi and Inoue ([10]) use finite automata to represent actions performing simple actions to teach a robot. Implicit in the model is the assumption of 1 between 2 intervals <ref> [2] </ref>. strictly sequential sub-actions, which, although adequate for the mapping into robot primitives, seems to be a strong restriction for the representation of generic human actions. Similarly, Nagel ([16]) uses transition diagrams to represent driver's maneuvers in a highway, but provides no means to represent overlapping activities. <p> are expressed using Allen's interval algebra (<ref> [2] </ref>) which employs disjunctions of the 13 possible primitive relationships between two time intervals: the relations equal (e), before (b), meet (m), overlap (o), during (d), start (s), finish (f), and their inverses, ib, im, io, id, is, and if (see fig. 1 and [2] for the definition of those relationships). Input Specification pick-up-bowl corresponds to the period where the action of picking up the bowl is occuring. This action is decomposed into two sub-actions corresponding to the intervals reach-for-bowl and grasp-bowl.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The majority of work on the machine understanding of motion sequences has focused on the recovery of the two-dimensional optic flow or the three-dimensional motion of the objects or camera. Recently, however, emphasis has shifted to the interpretation or classification of the observed motion. Bobick <ref> [4] </ref> provides a taxonomy of motion understanding problems labeled as movements, activities, and actions. One of the central differences between these levels is the degree to which time must be manipulated to recognize the motion.

Reference-contexts: Implicit in this constraint is the fact that the two sub-actions are mutually exclusive. Allen's algebra was chosen as the underlying temporal formalism because we consider essential the ability to express mutually exclusive actions; for this reason, we can not use temporal algebras based on relations between endpoints (like <ref> [6, 27] </ref>), in spite of the better performance of the reasoning methods they provide.

Reference-contexts: Typically, unary constraints are imposed on the intervals, as, for example, by constraining the duration of some of the intervals, or requiring that some of the intervals to be contained in pre-determined intervals (see <ref> [14] </ref> for an account of different methods). Using constraint propagation techniques ([14]) it is possible to determine if there is an assignment of time intervals to all the variables x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n of an IA-network X which satisfy both the original binary

Reference-contexts: We start by proposing the use of Allen's temporal primitives ([2]) to describe the richness of the temporal structure of human action. Unlike previous work on action recognition ([24, 16]) the proposed representation (evolved from <ref> [17] </ref>), enables multiple possibilities for the sequencing of sub-actions, including parallelism and mutual exclusion. <p> Inference of Stronger Constraints Notice that most of the relationships defined in this example do not involve "deep" common-sense reasoning. For instance, bowl-in-hands and bowl-out-of-hands are temporally mutually exclusive simply because by definition they represent logically opposite states of the bowl. In <ref> [17] </ref>, it is shown that it is possible to generate the decomposition of actions into sub-actions using "shallow" common-sense reasoning, using a representation scheme based on Schank's conceptualizations ([22]).

Reference-contexts: Table 1 displays the function fl which maps the 13 Allen's primitive relationships into their equivalent binary-constraints between PNF symbols. Details about how the function fl preserves the semantics of the original IA-network can be found in <ref> [18] </ref>. Given a binary constraint in an IA-network, i.e., a set of primitive relationships Q, we can define its projection by the function : (Q) = 2Q where the union of the primitive binary constraints is defined as their component-wise union.

Reference-contexts: Implicit in this constraint is the fact that the two sub-actions are mutually exclusive. Allen's algebra was chosen as the underlying temporal formalism because we consider essential the ability to express mutually exclusive actions; for this reason, we can not use temporal algebras based on relations between endpoints (like <ref> [6, 27] </ref>), in spite of the better performance of the reasoning methods they provide. <p> The result of the algorithm is an approximation of the temporal closure of the network, that is, the set of all temporal relations which follow from the initial constraints (see <ref> [27] </ref> for a discussion about how well Allen's algorithm approximate the temporal closure). Figure 3 shows part of the IA-network of "pick-up bowl" after path-consistency, where the intervals corresponding to detectors are omitted for clarity. <p> The temporal structure of each action is codified manually into an IA-network. The IA-networks are pre-processed using Allen's path-consistency algorithm (revised in <ref> [27] </ref>) and then converted into PNF-networks. To test the PNF formulation, we manually extract the values for the sensors by watching a video of the action being performed.
