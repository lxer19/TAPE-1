Abstract: We describe an efficient method for localizing a mobile robot in an environment with landmarks. We assume that the robot can identify these landmarks and measure their bearings relative to each other. Given such noisy input, the algorithm estimates the robot's position and orientation with respect to the map of the environment. The algorithm makes efficient use of our representation of the landmarks by complex numbers. The algorithm runs in time linear in the number of landmarks. We present results of simulations and propose how to use our method for robot navigation.
