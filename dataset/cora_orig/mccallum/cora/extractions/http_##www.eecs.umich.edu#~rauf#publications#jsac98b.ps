Abstract: Decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE), which is a reduced-complexity alternative to maximum likelihood sequence estimation, can be used effectively for equalization of inter-symbol interference as well as for multiuser detection. The algorithm performs very well for whitened (minimum-phase) channels. For non-minimum-phase channels, however, the algorithm is not very effective. Moreover, DFSE requires a noise-whitening filter, which may not be feasible to compute for time-varying channels like a multiuser DS-CDMA channel. Noise-whitening is also cumbersome for applications that involve bi-directional equalization such as the GSM system. In such conditions, it is desirable to use the Ungerboeck formulation for sequence estimation which operates directly on the discrete-time unwhitened statistic obtained from conventional matched filtering. Unfortunately, decision feedback sequence estimation based on matched filter statistics is severely limited by untreated interference components. In this paper, we identify the anti-causal interference components using an error probability analysis. This leads us to a modified unwhitened decision feedback sequence estimator (MUDFSE) where the components are canceled using tentative decisions. We obtain approximate error probability bounds for the proposed algorithm. Performance results indicate that the modified algorithm used on unwhitened channels with relatively small channel correlations, provides similar

Reference-contexts: In the GSM system, training sequences are inserted in the middle of the burst to aid channel estimation. Equalization over the data field is then performed bi-directionally starting out from the training sequence <ref> [5] </ref>. If the channel response is minimum-phase in one direction, it is maximum-phase in the other 2 . DFSE performs poorly in maximum-phase conditions and is thus unsuitable for equalization in this case. Besides channels with inter-symbol interference, decision feedback sequence estimation can be employed for multiuser detection. <p> However, the operation is computationally expensive. Ungerboeck's formulation for sequence estimation is better suited in conditions such as those mentioned above. A reduced-state Ungerboeck-type variant to DFSE, which we call unwhitened decision feedback sequence estimation (UDFSE), was derived in [8] 3 and <ref> [5] </ref>. It operates on discrete-time unwhitened statistics obtained from conventional matched filtering. UDFSE is thus insensitive to channel phase and does not require a noise-whitening filter. However, the scheme does not perform as well as DFSE on most channels.
