Abstract: We extend the conventional BDD-based model checking algorithms to verify systems with non-linear arithmetic constraints. We represent each constraint as a BDD variable, using the information from a constraint solver to prune the BDDs by removing paths that correspond to infeasible constraints. We illustrate our technique with a simple example, which has been analyzed with our prototype implementation.

Reference-contexts: We have been studying the practicality of model checking for specifications of large and complex reactive software systems of this type. Our major effort has been directed at the preliminary requirements of one such system, TCAS II, an airborne collision avoidance system used on many commercial aircraft. In <ref> [ABB + 96] </ref> we applied BDD-based model checking to about one third of the TCAS II specification, discovering a number of violations of desirable properties. The full specification expressed in RSML [LHHR94], a dialect of Statecharts [Har87]comprises about 400 pages.

Reference-contexts: The idea is that when the automobile is too close to the vehicle in front, the cruise control system will automatically deactivate itself. (In addition to TCAS, the example was influenced by the one used by Atlee and Gannon <ref> [AG93] </ref>.) Three numeric inputs to the system are s o , the velocity of the vehicle; s f , the velocity of the front vehicle; and d 0, the distance between the vehicles. (In reality, s f may be estimated from the current and previous values of s o and d.)

Reference-contexts: The high dependence between control and data paths also prevents us from separating them for verification, a technique that is sometimes used in microprocessor verification. Most work on handling non-linearity in verification has been focused on arithmetic circuits. One approach is to use BMDs or *BMDs <ref> [BC95] </ref> and their variants, such as HDDs [CFZ95]. Although they can represent the product xy concisely, representing the constraint xy = z still requires exponential size. In fact, Thathachar [Tha97] shows that small variations of these representations are not likely to solve the problem.

Reference-contexts: CTL* is strictly more expressive than CTL and LTL, commonly used in model checking.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Although symbolic model checking <ref> [BCM + 90] </ref> based on Binary Decision Diagrams [Bry86], or BDDs, has been remarkably successful for verifying finite state systems, it fails when complex arithmetic constraints are present. <p> In general, we have (S ^ Feas) Filter Feas S S (the inclusions refer to the sets represented by the Boolean functions). Although Filter Feas S still contains some infeasible states, we will show that it is sufficient for model checking. The algorithms for symbolic model checking <ref> [BCM + 90] </ref> involve four types of operations on sets of states: Boolean operations, emptiness checking, image (or pre-image) computation, and finding elements in non-empty sets (for counterexample traces).

Reference-contexts: For example, if the bits of the integers x, y and z are represented as BDD variables, any BDD for the non-linear constraint xy = z has exponential size <ref> [LS81, Bry91] </ref>. In this paper, we tightly couple a constraint solver with a BDD-based model checker to verify systems with possibly non-linear arithmetic constraints. A large class of embedded, reactive systems consist of a finite-state control component together with numeric data inputs that measure quantities such as velocity, temperature, etc.

Reference-contexts: Our approach can deal with not only integral multiplicative constraints but also arbitrarily complex (e.g., trigonometric) constraints over finite or infinite domains, provided an appropriate constraint solver is available. Abstracting a constraint as a single Boolean variable is not a new idea (e.g., <ref> [CDV96] </ref>). However, since infeasible combinations of constraints are not automatically detected, either the approach is incomplete for safety properties, or it requires substantial manual abstraction. Wang et al. [WME93] also represent certain timing constraints in distributed real-time systems as BDD variables.

Reference-contexts: We try to avoid a similar preprocessing by restricting the class of systems that we deal with and by pruning the BDDs on the fly. Note that the work on nonlinear hybrid systems <ref> [HH95] </ref> differs from ours because nonlinearity there refers to differential equations. 2 Models We first give the definitions of basic transition systems, bisimulation equivalence, and quotient systems.

The constraint solver used was QUAD-CLP (R ) [PB94], a less incomplete solver than CLP (R ) for quadratic constraints. We had access only to the executable of the solver, so it was integrated with SMV through interprocess communication.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, an observer sees the label of the current state, but not the state itself. Two states are indistinguishable if their labels are the same and their successors are again indistinguishable. Formally, we say that an equivalence relation of Q is a bisimulation (cf. <ref> [Mil80, p. 42] </ref>) if for all states q 1 and q 2 , we have that q 1 q 2 implies (1) L (q 1 ) equals L (q 2 ); (2) for all q 0 1 in Q with q 1 ! q 0 1 , there exists a q
