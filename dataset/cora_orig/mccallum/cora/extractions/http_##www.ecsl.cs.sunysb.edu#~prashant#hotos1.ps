Abstract: As network routers evolve towards supporting ever more higher-level networking functions beyond traditional network-layer and transport-layer protocols, programmability becomes a major design issue in network device OS (NDOS), which until very recently has been based on the type of OS used in embedded systems. On the other hand, it is now possible to build high-performance Internet routers from off-the-shelf PC-class hardware, particularly with the use of clustering technology. The goal of the Suez project is to build a cluster-based Internet router using general-purpose processors as input/output link controllers and packet schedulers, and a Gigabit/sec system area network as the switching fabric. This paper presents the design and initial implementation of the Suez OS, which features scalable real-time packet scheduling, cache-conscious routing-table lookup, intra-cluster distributed buffer memory management, and a highly efficient kernel extension mechanism for active networking using segmentation hardware.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the fact that Suez is built on PC clusters requires that the buffer memory distributed across the router cluster be managed as a global pool and packets be moved within the router buffer with minimal data copying. 2.1 Scalable Real-Time Packet Scheduling The fluid-fair queueing (FFQ) model <ref> [2] </ref> has been shown to be an ideal packet scheduling model to provide tight performance bounds on delay, bandwidth, and jitter, to real-time network connections. However, efficient implementation techniques that scale with the link speed to terabit/sec range remain elusive.

Reference-contexts: However, efficient implementation techniques that scale with the link speed to terabit/sec range remain elusive. The baseline implementation algorithm for FFQ is packetized weighted fair queueing (WFQ) <ref> [3] </ref>, which consists of two major steps: computing the target finish time for the head packet of each real-time connection, and selecting the packet with the earliest target finish time by sorting among head packets.

Reference-contexts: Suez trades memory requirement for performance by implementing a three-level table-indexing data structure that performs longest prefix match by indexing a bounded number of pre-determined tables. This data structure is essentially a three-level compressed trie. A more general formulation of such a data structure has recently appeared in <ref> [6] </ref>. A detailed description of this routing-table search scheme and its performance results based on trace-driven simulation as well as prototype measurement can be found in [7]. 2.3 Efficient Data Buffering and Movement Suez's hardware platform consists of a set of nodes connected by a Myrinet switch.

Each node has an external link connected to the outside world based on such high-speed links as OC-12 and an internal link to the rest of Suez using Myrinet. <p> Scheduling overhead of a batch is masked completely by the data transfer of the previous batch. 3.2 Routing Lookup Overhead To evaluate Suez's routing performance, the prototype is fed with the trace used in <ref> [7] </ref> which represents all traffic passing through the egress router serving Brookhaven National Labs. This trace was evaluated against a 16KByte 4-way associative cache on the Pentium-IIs. The result was 8.04 million lookups per second.

Reference-contexts: That is, the FGFFQ scheduling framework allows low-delay low-bandwidth real-time network applications such as Internet phones to enjoy low-delay-bound network service without reserving more bandwidth than necessary. For details on the FGFFQ algorithm and its performance bounds, please refer to <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.2 Cache-Conscious Routing-Table Lookup For best-effort packets, routing-table lookup is the most performance critical operation as they traverse through a network router. Recognizing the powerful memory hierarchy architected into general-purpose CPUs, we make the following design decisions to structure the routing-table lookup implementation.
