Abstract: We consider automatic target recognition (ATR) with high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in this paper. We present a prototype structural model-based system for SAR ATR. The system achieved a 98.9% recognition rate. Typical CPU time for an end-to-end recognition task is ~ 1.5 minutes in Matlab on a SGI Indy R4400SC 150 MHz. Studies of persistent scattering confirm the feasibility of structural model-based recognition with real SAR imagery. Target segmentation is based on image peaks and Delaunay triangulation. We define leading edges of a generic vehicle model for target azimuth estimation independent of target class. Leading edges also form a target coordinate frame. Measurements with respect to this coordinate frame are quasi-invariant under rigid body transformations. A two-step technique using hypothesis generation and iterative Newton-Raphson search is devised for efficient image alignment.

Reference-contexts: The topics include persistent scattering, target segmentation, generic vehicle model estimation, image alignment, and target recognition. Persistent scattering of ISAR (turntable data) and synthesized SAR (XPATCH) imagery were studied by Dudgeon et al. [Dudgeon et al, 1994] and Binford et al. <ref> [Binford et al., 1997] </ref> respectively. In this paper, we focus on the study of persistent scattering of real SAR (MSTAR) imagery. The results give evidence that there are enough scatterers with sufficient persistency for structural model-based recognition. Target segmentation is done using image peaks (bright points) and Delaunay triangulations.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on the study of persistent scattering of real SAR (MSTAR) imagery. The results give evidence that there are enough scatterers with sufficient persistency for structural model-based recognition. Target segmentation is done using image peaks (bright points) and Delaunay triangulations. We summarize our previous work <ref> [Wang, 1997] </ref> on target segmentation in Section 3. The indexing problem of selecting candidate templates or models for matching is addressed by estimation of a generic vehicle model. Parameters of a generic model, orientation, length and width are found using a weighted-amplitude ideogram and a weighting strategy. <p> Figure 2 shows that on the average there are 10 peaks that persist for more than 15 consecutive degrees. 3 Target Segmentation The segmentation module is an implementation (with minor modifications) of the segmentation technique developed by Wang and Binford <ref> [Wang, 1997] </ref> for SAR imagery. The technique involves peak detection, peak selection, Delau-nay triangulation, and breaking long links in the triangulations.

Reference-contexts: Note that the LLEs are pulled towards the SLEs. Since SAR images are the projection of targets onto the slant plane, the dimensions in the range direction will be foreshortened by a factor of cos <ref> [Keydel et al., 1996] </ref> as shown in Figure 8. On the other hand, the dimensions in the cross-range direction are unchanged. As a result, the angle of an edge will be increased or decreased slightly.
