Abstract: The term matching pursuits refers to a greedy algorithm which matches signal structures to a large, diverse dictionary of functions. The technique was proposed by Mallat and Zhang 1 with an application to signal analysis. In this paper, we show how matching pursuits can be used to effectively code the motion residual in a hybrid video coding system at bit rates below 20 kbit/s. One advantage of this technique at low bit rates is that bits are assigned progressively to high energy areas in the motion residual. The proper choice of a dictionary set can lead to other advantages. For instance, a large dictionary with a wide variety of structures can represent a residual signal using fewer coefficients than the DCT basis. Also, a dictionary which is not block-based can reduce block distortions common to low bit rate DCT systems. Experimental results are presented in which the DCT residual coder from a standard coding system is replaced by a matching pursuit coder. These results show a substantial improvement in both PSNR and perceived visual quality. Further improvements result when the matching pursuit coder is paired with a smooth motion model using overlapping motion blocks.
