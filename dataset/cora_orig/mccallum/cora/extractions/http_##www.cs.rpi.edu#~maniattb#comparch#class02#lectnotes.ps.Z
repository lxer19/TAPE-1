Maniatty 4 Performance and Throughput Dept. of Computer Science, Rensselaer 4 Performance and Throughput Hennessy and Patterson <ref> [2] </ref> denote response time of a job on a machine X as: Execution Time X . They call throughput performance, so: Performance X = 1 Execution Time X (5) Computer Architectures 75425 W. A.

Reference-contexts: 1 How To Choose a Mean? Dept. of Computer Science, Rensselaer 1 How To Choose a Mean? Jain <ref> [3] </ref> recommends that when the values being averaged are NOT a ratio: * Select the arithmetic mean when the sum of values is of interest. * Select the geometric mean when the product of values is of interest.

Jain <ref> [3] </ref> recommends that when averaging a ratio: 1. If the sums of numerators and denominators both have a physical meaning, the average of the ratio is the ratio of the averages. <p> A. Maniatty 3 Introduction to Performance Dept. of Computer Science, Rensselaer 3 Introduction to Performance Performance denotes computational speed measurements and is sensitive to scheduling efficiency. Jain <ref> [3] </ref> categorizes classic performance measures: 1. Time (e.g. response time) 2. Rate (e.g. throughput) 3. Resource (e.g. utilization) Computer Architectures 75425 W. A.
