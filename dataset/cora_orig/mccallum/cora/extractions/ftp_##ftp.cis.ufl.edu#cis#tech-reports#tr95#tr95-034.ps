Reference-contexts: It adapted a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) [OMG 1991] for achieving object interoperability. The interfaces of all objects of interest are specified in a common Interface Definition Language (IDL) <ref> [Acker 1993, OMG 1991] </ref>. An interface specification is compiled to generate program skeletons and stubs for inclusion into the server programs and the client programs, respectively. <p> They are being tested and refined. The compiler of K.3, which generates C++ code for application system development, and IDL specifications and C code for program bindings, has been implemented and demonstrated. We have used the IBM's implementation of ORB (i.e., SOM/DSOM <ref> [Acker 1993] </ref>) to verify the rule-based interoperability concept presented in this paper. The run-time and build-time supports provided by the OSAM*.KBMS are being tested in the NIIIP environment in which several VE servers interoperate. The IDL-NCL translator is yet to be implemented.

Reference-contexts: This condition is an object pattern specification expressed in an object-oriented query language OQL <ref> [Alashqur 1989] </ref>. It verifies if there exists an X object instance which is associated with some object instance of Y (* is the association operator) but is not associated with any object instance of Z (! is the non-association operator).

Reference-contexts: Section 5 gives a summary and a conclusion. 2 Description of NCL NCL is an integration of the language features of IDL, EXPRESS and K.3. K.3 is the version 3 of an implemented knowledge base programming language developed at the University of Florida <ref> [Shyy and Su 1991, Arroyo-Figueroa 1992] </ref>. NCL's underlying object model is the extensible object model of K.3, which is founded on the concept of objects and object associations introduced in the Object-oriented Semantic Association Model (OSAM* [Su 1989]) and its algebra and calculus ([Su 1993a, Kamel 1994]).

Reference-contexts: A triggered operation may in turn trigger other rules. The automatic enforcement of these rules makes the underlying system active. It has been widely recognized that the concepts and techniques of agents <ref> [Carver 1993, Finin 1993, Genesereth 1994, Lan 1992] </ref>, mediators [Wiederhold 1992, Wiederhold 1994, Wiederhold 1995] and negotiators [Lan 1993, Moehlman 1992] are very useful for achieving information and program sharing in a complex, heterogeneous computing environment.

Reference-contexts: Thus, much of the needed semantics have to be embedded in the application code. Recognizing the limitations of the object model underlying most of the existing object-oriented DBMSs, the Object Data Management Group (ODMG <ref> [Cattell 1995] </ref>) and others [e.g., [Florescu 1995]] have made some effort to extend the object model's capabilities to capture some semantic constraints of data such as "key" and "inverse attribute" constraints. However, these extensions are still far from meeting the actual needs for modeling complex manufacturing products.

Reference-contexts: The ISO/STEP community, on the other hand, emphasizes the development of standards for product modeling and product data exchange. One of its major efforts is the development of an information modeling language named EXPRESS <ref> [ISO 1992] </ref>. EXPRESS provides a rich set of constraint specifications by using keywords, functions, procedures and constraint rules. It is a powerful information modeling language. The language has been widely accepted and used by a number of product design and manufacturing communities.
