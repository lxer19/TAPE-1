Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic extraction and tracking of 2D contours of the tongue surfaces from digital ultrasound image sequences. The input to the system is provided by a Head and Transducer Support System (HATS), which is developed for use in ultrasound imaging of the tongue movement. We developed a novel active contour (snakes) model that uses several temporally adjacent images during the extraction of the tongue surface contour for an image frame. The user supplies an initial contour model for a single image frame in the whole sequence. Using optical flow and multi-resolution methods, this initial contour is then used to find the candidate contour points in the temporally immediate adjacent images. Subsequently, the new snake mechanism is applied to estimate optimal contours for each image frame using these candidate points. In turn, the extracted contours are used as models for the extraction process of new adjacent frames. Finally, the system uses a novel postprocess-ing technique to refine the positions of the contours. We tested the system on 11 different speech sequences, each containing about 25 images. Visual inspection of the detected contours by the speech experts shows that the results are very promising and this system can be effectively employed in speech and swallowing research.

Reference-contexts: E ext (v i ; I) = jrI (v i )j : In Equation (2), weighting parameter is set by using min-max principle <ref> [2] </ref>, which maximizes the equation with respect to and minimizes it over possible v i positions. The advantage of using min-max principle is that it will prevent the selection of a weighting parameter that represents E smo or E sim insufficiently in the minimized internal energy.

Reference-contexts: Figure 7 illustrates this process. Our usage of multiple snakes was motivated by the dual-snake approach proposed by Gunn and Nixon <ref> [3] </ref>, which uses closed snakes unlike our open-ended snakes. In their method, one snake expands from the inside of the region of interest and one snake contracts from the outside.

Reference-contexts: The image se quence of this frame is shown in Figure 9.) Our system uses a deformable model based on active contour models <ref> [4] </ref> as the main tool for detecting the contour of the tongue surface. Considering the problems listed above, snakes are attractive. First, snakes facilitate initial contours, so that an initial contour model can be given to the system by the user. <p> E smo (v i ) corresponds to the smoothness term in the original snake formulation <ref> [4] </ref>. It is estimated as (Figure 2), E smo (v i ) = 1 cos i = 1 v i1 v i : v i v i+1 jv i1 v i j jv i v i+1 j where i = 2 : : : (n 1). <p> If it is used as the only internal energy term, this smoothness term suffers from some of the problems with the original smoothness constraints <ref> [4] </ref>, e.g., tendency to shrink around strong edge points. However, this does not create a problem for our system because the internal energy of the snake uses this smoothness constraint in combination with the similarity constraint.

Reference-contexts: However, this does not create a problem for our system because the internal energy of the snake uses this smoothness constraint in combination with the similarity constraint. The similarity term E sim (v i ; S) is similar to the one proposed by Lai and Chin <ref> [5] </ref>. However, it is employed in a completely different way. Lai and Chin use this energy as the only internal energy for their deformable model. In our system, it is uniquely used in combination with smoothness term.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our system needs only one contour model for the whole image sequence. It is the task of the system to extract and use information from the adjacent frames in the sequence. Laprie and Berger <ref> [6] </ref> also use snakes to extract tongue surfaces from X-ray images. Although similarities exist between our systems, there are fundamental differences in terms of image modalities and deformable contour models.

Reference-contexts: In order to automatically extract and detect the tongue surface from an image sequence, we developed a system that uses ultrasound images of the tongue produced by HATS <ref> [7] </ref>. Although HATS solved several difficulties in taking reliable and accurate ultrasound tongue images, there are problems that should still be addressed. Some of these problems were listed in Unser and Stone [8](Figure 1). First, ultrasound images of the tongue are quite noisy.

Reference-contexts: Although in the literature there are some systems extracting 2D tongue surface contours, to the best of our knowledge, our system is the first one to automatically extract surfaces for a complete ultrasound speech sequence. Unser and Stone <ref> [8] </ref> developed a system that takes a single ultrasound tongue image and extracts the tongue surface for that frame. For each image, the user has to supply some parameters to the system, e.g., the region of interest. <p> Figure 9 shows the detected contours from the system on a speech sequence. Visual inspection of these contours shows that results are very promising and are virtually identical with the contours extracted manually with the help of previously developed software <ref> [8] </ref>. Currently, we are developing an optimization algorithm that uses a spatiotemporal surface to satisfy the coherence of tongue movement restrictions during speech and swallowing. We also are implementing a new version of this system that can run on a multiprocessor system.
