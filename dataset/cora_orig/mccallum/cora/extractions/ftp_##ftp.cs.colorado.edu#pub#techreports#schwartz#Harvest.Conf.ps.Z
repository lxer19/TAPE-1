Abstract: It is increasingly difficult to make effective use of Internet information, given the rapid growth in data volume, user base, and data diversity. In this paper we introduce Harvest, a system that provides a scalable, customizable architecture for gathering, indexing, caching, replicating, and accessing Internet information.
