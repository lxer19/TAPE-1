Abstract: We use a finite element software based on the stabilized Galerkin Least-Squares method to solve the Navier Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation coupled to an energy equation through the temperature. We study melt flows associated with a Czochralski crystal growth process with the goal of understanding the transition from a steady laminar regime to an unsteady one as the Grashof number increases.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Single crystals having specific electrical, mechanical, and optical properties are needed for high-performance electronic and opto-electronic applications involving, e.g., semiconductors and laser modulators. Mathematical modeling and numerical simulation have improved the ability to understand the bulk crystal-growth processes <ref> [1] </ref>. With powerful parallel computers, this can be advanced further to enhance and control these complex systems. The more limited goal of this investigation is an understanding of the transition from steady laminar, to transient, to turbulent flow of a molten liquid crystal with increasing Grashof number. <p> The flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and an energy equation [9] ae 0 U ;t + r (F adv F diff ) = S; ae 0 c p (T ;t + u rT ) r (rT ) = 0; (1) where U = <ref> [1; u T ] </ref> T ; F adv diff i = [0; oe 1i ; oe 2i ; oe 3i ] T ; (2) Here, u = [u 1 ; u 2 ; u 3 ] T is the fluid velocity, T is the temperature, p is the pressure, oe is

Reference-contexts: Such flows may be characterized by the Grashof number, which is a ratio of the buoyancy to the viscous forces. As the Grashof number increases, axially-symmetric solutions cease to be stable and the flow bifurcates from steady states to unsteady states and, eventually, to turbulence <ref> [3] </ref>. Computational methods used to simulate crystal growth processes include finite difference [4], finite volume [5], finite element [6, 7], and spectral [8] methods. Herein, we use a Galerkin Least-Squares finite element method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation 1 with an energy equation coupled through temperature.

Reference-contexts: An implicit, second-order accurate family of time integration routines has been developed for this application. This new time integration software extends Chung and Hulbert's <ref> [13] </ref> generalized alpha method. Time discretization results in a nonlinear algebraic problem that is solved as a predictor-corrector pair leading to successive linear algebraic problems. The solution of each linear system is notoriously difficult for incompressible flows, especially those at high Reynolds numbers and those associated with high aspect-ratio elements.
