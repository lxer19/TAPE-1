Abstract: The main goal of this article is the introduction of a special factorization algorithm of refinable vectors that generalizes the scalar case as closely (and unexpectedly) as possible: the original vector is shown to be `almost' in the form B k fl F , with F still compactly supported and refinable, and k the approximation order of S(): `almost' in the sense that and B k fl F differ at most in one entry. The algorithm guarantees F to retain the possible favorable properties of , such as the stability of the shifts of and/or the polynomiality of the mask symbol. At the same time, the theory and the algorithm are derived under relatively mild conditions and, in particular, apply to whose shifts are not stable, as well as to refinable vectors which are not compactly supported.

Reference-contexts: Proof: First, since we assume that S ( ) provides approximation order k, and since we further assume that b is bounded around the origin, then, must have a k-fold zero at each j 2 2ZZn0 (see <ref> [BDR1] </ref>). Let G 1 be the support function of O + 2ZZ, G 2 := 1 G 1 . <p> We then define the factor F to be (; D k (n 0 )). Note that B k fl F = ( 0 ; r k (n 0 )) =: 1 . Since (cf. e.g., <ref> [BDR1] </ref>) S ( 1 ) = S (), we conclude that the above process is indeed a `factorization of order k'. <p> For that we observe first that b 1 (0) 6= 0 (otherwise, since C (0) b F (0) = 0 by assumption, we get from the linear independence of the last n 1 columns of C (0) that b F (0) = 0.) Thus, <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, in order to prove that S ( 1 ) provides approximation order k, it suffices to show that P j22ZZn0 j c 1 (u + j)j 2 = O (juj 2k ), near the origin.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the [RS] method allows one to find separately the smoothness of each entry of F (previous results, such as that of <ref> [CDP] </ref> which incidentally is based on the [P] factorization, could find only the common smoothness of all the functions in ).

Reference-contexts: Thus (4:7) b F = b B 1 We state below the corollary that summarizes those observations. In that corollary we use the following (essentially known: cf. e.g. <ref> [DM] </ref>, Lemma 2.1, and the case k = 1 in Result 2.3) lemma: Lemma 4.8.

Reference-contexts: But t C is 2-periodic, and the vectors b F (j), j 2 2ZZ, span all of C F (due to the linear independence of b F over 2ZZ), hence it easily follows that t C vanishes to order k at the origin. 12 Example: Orthogonal GHM-scaling functions <ref> [GHM] </ref>.

In order to explain our motivation, we first note that the factorization outlined in the previous subsection `shu*es' the vector . <p> More precisely, in contrast with the unavailable `naive factorization' = B fl F (where there is a natural correspondence between the elements of and F ), no simple relation exists (in the method of <ref> [P] </ref>) between the original entries of and those of the factor F .

Using, e.g., the matrix factorization of Example 4.5 of <ref> [P] </ref>, we obtain P (u) = 4 1 ~ C (2u) ~ Q (u) ~ C (u) 1 with ~ C (u) = 2 (1 + e iu ) 2 2 1 5 (1 + e iu ) : The function vector ~ F = (ffi; ~ f 2 ) T <p> In fact, [RS] is the first article to tackle the regularity problem without the assumption of stability. We note that in one variable a factorization method (of a completely different nature compared to the one here or that in <ref> [P] </ref>) can still be used to overcome that particular problem (cf. [R3] for a discussion of that other factorization technique in the univariate scalar case). (iii) The attempt to find separate regularity estimates for each of the entries in .

(As a matter of fact, the [BDR4] results we use were tailored by the [BDR4] authors to help us in developing the present method.) We review those details in x2, and also prove in that section the extension of the <ref> [R1] </ref> result that guarantees the factorization of the superfunction into the form B k fl F . In x3, we provide a unified approach to factorization which is based on superfunction theory basics. <p> The only result that does not extend beyond the univariate setup is the next theorem. As mentioned before, the compact support case of this result (i.e., statement (a) here) can already be found in <ref> [R1] </ref>. Theorem 2.6. Let 2 L 2 (IR) and assume that, for some origin neighborhood O, b is k-times continuously differentiable on O + 2ZZn0, and is bounded on O. <p> This concludes the proof of the existence of satisfying = B fl . Now, we prove (a-c), and use for that a different argument (which applies uniformly well to all three cases, and which is an adaptation of the argument in <ref> [R1] </ref>). Firstly, note that the Fourier transform of D k has a k-fold zero at each j 2 2ZZn0, and also has a similar zero at the origin.

Reference-contexts: However, the property P 2 C is not inherited by Q. We turn our attention now to the proof of Theorem 4.1. For that, several preparations are needed. We start with the following definition from <ref> [R2] </ref>: Definition 4.3. Let k be a positive integer. <p> Thus, if the refinable S () satisfies the Property H (k) and has non-zero intersection with W k1 2 , it must provide approximation order k. The reference <ref> [R2] </ref> establishes simple sufficient conditions for the satisfaction of the H (k) property. For example, it shows that in the univariate case every local FSI space satisfies that property, regardless of the value of k. However, if the generators are not compactly supported, more should be assumed. <p> For example, it shows that in the univariate case every local FSI space satisfies that property, regardless of the value of k.

We mention that the results of that reference apply to refinable vector functions in several variables, however, aiming at combining those techniques with our univariate factorization results, we describe the results of [RS] in a univariate context only. The functions/distributions we study here are the components of a refinable vector F , particularly that of Theorem 4.1. However, this study is only the means for finding the smoothness of the entries of the original refinable . <p> We prove this result at the end of this section (since the only proof we know involves the transfer operator, and is, surprisingly, very technical and elaborate). The reference <ref> [RS] </ref> suggests two equivalent techniques for determining the smoothness of a refinable , the transfer operator approach, and the subdivision operator approach. <p> The problem can be solved without factorization (see below) but at the cost of the above-mentioned numerical instability. (ii) The shifts of are not stable/pre-stable. This grants the subdivision operator additional irrelevant eigenvalues (that may or may not be large), hence should be suppressed, too, if large. In fact, <ref> [RS] </ref> is the first article to tackle the regularity problem without the assumption of stability. <p> The use of the trigonometric polynomial u below is the way one suppresses the eigenvalues that arise from the positive smoothness of the entries of (cf. (i) above). Finally, componentwise estimates of the smoothness are obtained by choosing different initial seeds. We quote now two different results from <ref> [RS] </ref>: the first concerns the smoothness of L 2 -refinable , and the second concerns the smoothness of whose entries are not in L 2 . <p> For the converse we let T be the transfer operator defined as follows: let F be refinable with mask Q. Then T is defined on all F fi F matrices H whose entries are in L 2 (TT) as T H := m=0 + 2m ): Section 3 of <ref> [RS] </ref> proves that if is a sufficiently smooth compactly supported function with mean--value 1, and if u is a 2-periodic function which vanishes at the origin to a `high enough' order, and is positive in some punctured neighborhood of the origin, then, with G the Gramian of - fl F , <p> symbol of , then PHP fl = sin (s =2) 2k This implies, with T 1 the transfer operator associated with , that T 1 (u 0 G - ) = s 2k sin 2k (=2)T (uG - ); hence that T m Finally, since F and are compactly supported, <ref> [RS] </ref> shows that the matrices T m 1 (u 0 G - ) and T m (uG - ), m = 1; 2; : : : all lie in some finite dimensional space.
