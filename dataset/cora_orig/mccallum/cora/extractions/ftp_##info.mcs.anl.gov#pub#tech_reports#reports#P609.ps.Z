Abstract: We discuss an interactive environment for the visualization, analysis, and modification of computational models used in industrial settings. In particular, we focus on interactively placing massless, massed, and evaporating particulate matter in computational fluid dynamics applications. We discuss the numerical model used to compute the particle pathlines in the fluid flow for display and analysis. We briefly describe the toolkits developed for vector and scalar field visualization, interactive particulate source placement, and a three-dimensional GUI interface. This system is currently used in two industrial applications, and we present our tools in the context of these applications. We summarize the current state of the project and offer directions for future research.

Reference-contexts: The display device used for the applications in this article is the immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) developed at the University of Illinois at Chicago <ref> [1] </ref>. The three-dimensional visualizations in the CAVE provides insight and understanding of three-dimensional solution spaces not available when using a two-dimensional screen display mechanism.

Reference-contexts: We now briefly describe the ordinary differential equations governing these particles; a fuller description is available in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> In this section we describe the visualization toolkit for interactively placing particulate matter in the flow field and a three-dimensional graphical user interface used to increase application flexibility and control. We have discussed this work in some detail in <ref> [2] </ref>, and we give only a brief description here. The visualization environment is based on the CAVE technology developed at the Electronics Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. <p> Each streamline requires approximately 0.2 seconds to request, compute, and visualize when the visualization process and computational process are linked by a local ethernet or fast ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) connection <ref> [2] </ref>. Animated streamlines can also be used to demonstrate the large-scale structure of the flow fields in the geometry. Rather than choosing a single starting point, we interactively define a rectangular region of interest in the computational domain. <p> Once an initial configuration is selected, the position and orientation of each injector are communicated to the remote particle tracking process. The sprays are calculated by using a statistical model consisting of 500 massed evaporating particles for each injector <ref> [2] </ref>. The results for each injector are requested interactively and communicated back to the visualization process for display using continuous paths, which can be colored by source or by a user-defined scalar quantity. Injectors can be relocated by selecting them with the wand and dragging them to the new location.

Reference-contexts: For this system Diachin and Herzog have developed an analytic solution to the system of ordinary differential equations on linear tetrahedra <ref> [3] </ref>. This approach has the efficient implementation benefits of the modified fourth-order Runge-Kutte method described in [6] but is an exact solution using linear interpolation between spatial data points. Particle dynamics on hexahedral meshes are modeled by using the same techniques after decomposing the hexahedra into five tetrahedral elements. <p> Initial tests have been done on structured, Cartesian meshes, tetrahedral meshes, and body-fitted hexahedral meshes. Results show that this method eliminates one source of numerical error from the integration of Equations (1) and (2) and is more stable than standard numerical integration techniques <ref> [3] </ref> . It was further shown that for linear velocity fields this method is faster than forward Euler using a constant time step and is more accurate than fourth-order Runge-Kutte.

Reference-contexts: This package is linked to the CAVE visualization environment using the CAVEComm message-passing library developed at Argonne National Laboratory <ref> [4] </ref>. Using this interactive system, the engineer can easily define particle characteristics and sources from within the visualization environment and communicate these changes to a remote simulation process. The new results are calculated and returned for visualization and further modification in a matter of seconds.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we are building templates for typical CAVE application interactions, which should greatly reduce the start-up time required by each application. To increase the capabilities of the computational model, we are incorporating unstructured mesh techniques <ref> [5] </ref> and parallel processing to allow real-time interaction with more complex models. Advanced computational techniques such as boot-strapping the solution from a coarse grid to a fine grid and adaptive refinement methods are also being investigated.

This approach has the efficient implementation benefits of the modified fourth-order Runge-Kutte method described in <ref> [6] </ref> but is an exact solution using linear interpolation between spatial data points. Particle dynamics on hexahedral meshes are modeled by using the same techniques after decomposing the hexahedra into five tetrahedral elements. Thus, the method is designed to be independent of the particular volume discretization used.
