Abstract: One of the fundamental properties that both neural networks and the central nervous system share is the ability to learn and generalize from examples. While this property has been studied extensively in the neural network literature it has not been thoroughly explored in human perceptual and motor learning. We have chosen a coordinate transformation system|the visuomotor map which transforms visual coordinates into motor coordinates|to study the generalization effects of learning new input-output pairs. Using a paradigm of computer controlled altered visual feedback, we have studied the generalization of the visuomotor map subsequent to both local and context-dependent remappings. A local remapping of one or two input-output pairs induced a significant global, yet decaying, change in the visuomotor map, suggesting a representation for the map composed of units with large functional receptive fields. Our study of context-dependent remappings indicated that a single point in visual space can be mapped to two different finger locations depending on a context variable|the starting point of the movement. Furthermore, as the context is varied there is a gradual shift between the two remappings, consistent with two visuomotor modules being learned and gated smoothly with the context.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on spatial generalization, in a study restricted to one dimension, has led to the conclusion that the visuomotor map is constrained to generalize linearly <ref> (Bedford, 1989) </ref>. We test this conclusion by mapping out the pattern of generalization induced by one and two remapped points in two dimensions. <p> Harris, 1965) or linear constraints <ref> (Bedford, 1989) </ref> do not predict the decaying patterns of Cartesian generalization found.

Reference-contexts: However, our results do not rule out models in which a single visuomotor map is parametrized by starting location, such as one based on the coding of locations via movement vectors <ref> (Georgopoulos, 1990) </ref>. 5 Conclusions The goal of these studies has been to infer the internal constraints in the visuomotor system through the study of its patterns of generalization to local remappings.

Reference-contexts: A suggestive computational model for how such separate modules can be learned and combined is the mixture-of-experts neural network architecture <ref> (Jacobs et al., 1991) </ref>. Interpreted in this framework, the gradual effect of varying the context seen in Figure 4 could reflect the output of a gating network which uses context to modulate between two visuomotor maps.

Reference-contexts: The results from the spatial generalization study suggest that the visuomotor coordinate transformation is internally represented with units with large but localized receptive fields. For example, a neural network model with Gaussian radial basis function units <ref> (Moody and Darken, 1989) </ref>, which can be derived by assuming that the internal constraint in the visuomotor system is a smoothness constraint (Poggio and Girosi, 1989), predicts a pattern of generalization very similar the one experimentally observed (e.g. see Figure 5 for a simulation of the two point generalization experiment). 1
