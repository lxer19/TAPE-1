Abstract: This paper overviews the AA1 (Adaptive Algorithm 1) model of ASOCS the (Adaptive Self - Organizing Concurrent Systems) approach. It also presents promising empirical generalization results of AA1 with actual data. AA1 is a topologically dynamic network which grows to fit the problem being learned. AA1 generalizes in a self-organizing fashion to a network which seeks to find features which discriminate between concepts. Convergence to a training set is both guaranteed and bounded linearly in time.

Reference-contexts: Current ASOCS models are based on digital nodes. ASOCS also supports use of symbolic learning mechanisms, thus combining the parallelism and distributed nature of connectionist computing, with the potential power of AI symbolic learning. A proof of concept ASOCS chip has been developed <ref> [1] </ref>. ASOCS models have two significant advantages over other learning models; a) they are guaranteed to learn any arbitrary set of legal rules, and b) learning time is both fast and bounded (linear with the depth of the network, and logarithmic with the number of nodes).

Reference-contexts: In this paper, only single-output ASOCS are considered. The system is naturally extended to multiple-outputs <ref> [3] </ref>. The two main components of ASOCS AA1 are the adaption unit (AU) and the logic network of nodes. Figure 1 shows the overall system structure. <p> When a NI is input, the AU first makes the IT consistent and parsimonious. This is a simple bounded algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> which is not detailed here. The result of this process is a delete-list that contains the instances that are to be removed from the current instance set and an add-list that contains the instances that have been modified because of inconsistency with the NI.
