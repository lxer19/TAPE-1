Title: Approximate Medians and other Quantiles in One Pass and with Limited Memory  
Author: Gurmeet Singh Manku Sridhar Rajagopalan Bruce G. Lindsay 
Date: March 11, 1998  
Abstract: We present new algorithms for computing approximate quantiles of large datasets in a single pass. The approximation guarantees are explicit, and apply without regard to the value distribution or the arrival distributions of the dataset. The main memory requirements are smaller than those reported earlier by an order of magnitude. We also discuss methods that couple the approximation algorithms with random sampling to further reduce memory requirements. With sampling, the approximation guarantees are explicit but probabilistic, i.e., they apply with respect to a (user controlled) confidence parameter. We present the algorithms, their theoretical analysis and simulation results.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This article studies the problem of computing order statistics of large sequences of online or disk-resident data using as little main memory as possible. We focus on computing quantiles, which are elements at specific positions in the sorted order of the input. The -quantile, for 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is defined to be the element in position dN e in the sorted sequence of the input. Here, and in the rest of this paper N denotes the number of elements in the input. For = 0:5, the quantile is called the median. <p> However, there are no a-priori guarantees on the error. Agrawal and Swami <ref> [1] </ref> proposed another one pass algorithm. The idea here is to adjust equi-depth histogram boundaries on the fly when they do not appear to be in balance. Again, there are no strong and a-priori guarantees on error.

Reference-contexts: Agrawal and Swami [1] proposed another one pass algorithm. The idea here is to adjust equi-depth histogram boundaries on the fly when they do not appear to be in balance. Again, there are no strong and a-priori guarantees on error. Alsabti, Ranka and Singh <ref> [2] </ref> propose a data independent single pass algorithm with guaranteed error bounds. We describe this algorithm in more detail in Section 4.4. Random sampling can be a very useful tool in this context. It has been used by DeWitt et al [5] for distributed sorting. <p> Different buffer collapsing policies correspond to different algorithms. We now describe three interesting policies. 5 3.4 Collapse Policies Munro and Paterson [13] If there is an empty buffer, invoke New; otherwise, invoke Collapse on two buffers having the same weight. Alsabti, Ranka and Singh <ref> [2] </ref> Fill b=2 empty buffers by invoking New and then invoke Collapse on them. Repeat this b=2 times and invoke Output on the resulting buffers. New Algorithm Associate with each buffer X an integer `(X) that denotes its level.

Reference-contexts: The reader will judge the simplicity and understandability of our algorithms. 2 Antecedents 2.1 The Theory Literature The theory literature has primarily focused on counting the number of comparisons needed to find the exact median (quantile). The celebrated paper of Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest and Tarjan <ref> [3] </ref>, shows that selection of the kth largest element out of N can be done using at most 5:43N comparisons. This paper 2 also shows that at least 1:5N comparisons are required in the computation of the exact median.

Reference-contexts: Parallel database systems [4, 11] employ value range data partitioning that requires generation of splitters to divide the data into approximately equal parts. Distributed parallel sorting can also use splitter values to assign data elements to the nodes where they will be sorted <ref> [5] </ref>. 1 Approximate quantiles can be substituted for exact quantiles in all three applications, namely statis-tical data analysis, database query optimization and value range data partitioning. <p> Alsabti, Ranka and Singh [2] propose a data independent single pass algorithm with guaranteed error bounds. We describe this algorithm in more detail in Section 4.4. Random sampling can be a very useful tool in this context. It has been used by DeWitt et al <ref> [5] </ref> for distributed sorting. We discuss this idea and various applications in detail in Section 5. 2.3 Bridging the gap The ideas in the paper by Munro and Paterson can be applied to develop a one-pass algorithm for approximate quantiles.
