Abstract: The Unicode Standard, version 1.1, and ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993(E) jointly define a 16 bit character set (hereafter referred to as Unicode) which encompasses most of the worlds writing systems. However, Internet mail (STD 11, RFC 822) currently supports only 7-bit US ASCII as a character set. MIME(RFC 1521 and RFC 1522) extends Internet mail to support different media types and character sets, and thus could support Unicode in mail messages. MIME neither defines Unicode as a permitted character set nor specifies how it would be encoded, although it does provide for the registration of additional character sets over time. Although other transformation formats of Unicode exist and could conceivably be used in this context (most notably UTF-1 and UTF-8, also known as UTF-2 or UTF-FSS), they suffer the disadvantage that they use octets in the range decimal 128 through 255 to encode Unicode characters outside the US-ASCII range. Thus, in the context of mail, those octets must themselves be encoded. This requires putting text through two successive encoding processes, and leads to a significant expansion of characters outside the US-ASCII range, putting nonEnglish speakers at a disadvantage. For example, using UTF-FSS together with the Quoted-Printable content transfer encoding of MIME represents US-ASCII characters in one octet, but other characters may require up to nine octets.
