Reference-contexts: By contrast, programming languages can express conditional and repetitive actions very concisely. Alice uses Python <ref> [1] </ref> for its scripting language. Python is a very high level object oriented, extensible, interpreted language with a very clean syntax that is relatively easy to learn. Some observers have compared Pythons syntax to pseudocode that actually runs. Python is object oriented and extensible in C.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, a number of educators have commented on the promise of Alice for teaching object oriented concepts, and informed us that they plan to use Alice in their introductory programming classes. Alice has been compared favorably with Karel the Robot <ref> [2] </ref> and Rockys Boots [3], software packages that introduced students to programming concepts through fun and interactive activities. An important part of creating interactive 3D worlds is experimentation. This requires that people be able to quickly make changes and observe their effects. Development environments that use a compiled language (e.g.

Reference-contexts: For objects without an identifiable orientation (e.g. a sphere), the Forward and Up directions are no more arbitrary than X and Y. People have noted that this decision makes Alice feel like a 3D version of Logo <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition to providing abstractions that insulate the user from the implementation, we have made an effort to provide useful high level abstractions in the API. Examples are the Alice PointAt command that orients one object toward another, and the Place command that positions an object relative (e.g.
