Abstract: The coordination sequence fS(n)g of a lattice or net gives the number of nodes that are n bonds away from a given node. S(1) is the familiar coordination number. Extending work of O'Keeffe and others, we give explicit formulae for the coordination sequences of the root lattices A d , D d , E 6 , E 7 , E 8 and their duals. Proofs are given for many of the formulae, and for the fact that in every case S(n) is a polynomial in n, although some of the individual formulae are conjectural. In the majority of cases the set of nodes that are at most n bonds away from a given node form a polytopal cluster whose shape is the same as that of the contact polytope for the lattice. It is also shown that among all the Barlow packings in three dimensions the hexagonal close packing has the greatest coordination sequence, and the face-centered cubic lattice the smallest, as conjectured by O'Keeffe.

Reference-contexts: As in the work of Brunner and Laves [2], O'Keeffe [17], [18], Grosse-Kunstleve [15] and others, in our examples G will usually be the contact graph of a d-dimensional lattice packing <ref> [6] </ref> or net [29], formed by taking the vertices to be the points of the lattice or net and joining each point to its closest neighbors. <p> Although we will not study it here, there is another way to construct a graph from a lattice that has some advantages over the contact graph. This is the Voronoi graph: again the vertices represent lattice points, but now two vertices are joined if the corresponding Voronoi cells <ref> [6, p. 33] </ref> are adjacent. The contact graph is always a subgraph. <p> The contact graph has been used by the authors cited above as a way of defining the density of a lattice or net.

(iii) fl is well-placed if and only if the vertices on any face of the contact polytope span fl. <p> It follows from the work of Rajan and Shende ([20]; <ref> [6] </ref> , p. xxviii) that, except for root lattices, the Voronoi graph always properly contains the contact graph.

Reference-contexts: It is worth remarking that in this section we will see graphs in which the crystal ball numbers G (n) are equinumerous with centered simplices (the sodalite net), centered cubes (the generalized b.c.c. net), and centered orthoplexes (Z d ), representing all the regular polytopes in high dimensions (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). In Section 4 it is shown that among all Barlow packings, that is, those formed from layers of the hexagonal lattice, the hexagonal close packing (or h.c.p.) has both the highest coordination sequence and the highest crystal ball sequence, while the face-centered cubic (or f.c.c.) lattice has the lowest. <p> E 6 . The contact polytope for the root lattice E 6 is the polytope called 1 22 in Coxeter's notation ([4], p. 104; <ref> [9] </ref>, p. 201).

(ii) The fractional height of a lattice point in the cone above such a face is an integer if and only if the weight c i associated with that node is 1 (see [6], p. 483 and Fig. 23.1; <ref> [9] </ref>, p. 194). (iii) fl is well-placed if and only if the vertices on any face of the contact polytope span fl. The explanation for (ii) is that the c i 's give the index of the sublattice spanned by the vertices of the corresponding face.

Reference-contexts: The partial sums G (n) = S (0) + S (1) + + S (n) are called the crystal ball numbers.

Throughout this paper, if G is a distance-transitive graph with some fixed choice of origin, and u is a vertex of G, the height of u, ht (u), is the number of edges in the shortest path from u to the origin. <p> We call this the coordinator triangle: 1 1 2 1 1 4 6 4 1 In this case of course the coordinator triangle is simply Pascal's triangle of binomial coefficients d . O'Keeffe <ref> [17] </ref>, Table 6, gave the coordination sequences for d 10, but the present description is both simpler and holds for all d. It follows from (16) that the coefficient of n d1 in S (n) is 2 d =(d 1)!, as conjectured in [17]. <p> O'Keeffe <ref> [17] </ref>, Table 6, gave the coordination sequences for d 10, but the present description is both simpler and holds for all d.

Reference-contexts: The partial sums G (n) = S (0) + S (1) + + S (n) are called the crystal ball numbers. As in the work of Brunner and Laves [2], O'Keeffe [17], <ref> [18] </ref>, Grosse-Kunstleve [15] and others, in our examples G will usually be the contact graph of a d-dimensional lattice packing [6] or net [29], formed by taking the vertices to be the points of the lattice or net and joining each point to its closest neighbors. <p> lattices and nets that are related to the root lattices A d , D d , E d , the contact graphs and the associated coordination sequences are of considerable interest in their own right, and we shall investigate their properties in this paper, extending the work of O'Keeffe [17], <ref> [18] </ref>. Throughout this paper, if G is a distance-transitive graph with some fixed choice of origin, and u is a vertex of G, the height of u, ht (u), is the number of edges in the shortest path from u to the origin. <p> This establishes a conjecture made in <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> Theorem 6. Every lattice of dimension d at most 4 is well-coordinated. The cases d = 1 and 2 are easy. The case d = 3 follows from Theorem 5 and the fact (cf. <ref> [18] </ref>) that for a three-dimensional lattice, S (n) = (S (1) 2)n 2 + 2, n &gt; 0. The proof for d = 4 is longer and will be given elsewhere. <p> The proof for d = 4 is longer and will be given elsewhere. It follows from Theorem 4 that the coordination sequence for any four-dimensional lattice is given by S (n) = S (2) 3 n 3 S (2) 3 n ; (14) for n &gt; 0 (compare <ref> [18] </ref>, p. 906). On the other hand, the following five-dimensional lattice is not well-placed, and so not well-coordinated. <p> The lattice is well-coordinated, and G (n), S (n) (n &gt; 0) are polynomials in n of degrees d, d 1 respectively. The crystal balls are shorter ambo-diplo-simplices. O'Keeffe <ref> [18] </ref> empirically determined the coordination sequences for A d for d 7, in each case finding that S (n) is a polynomial in n of degree d 1. The correctness of these expressions is now justified. <p> Therefore h = P m i is an integer, and since (25) displays x as a sum of h minimal vectors, ht (x) = f ht (x) = h, showing that this lattice is well-coordinated. O'Keeffe <ref> [18] </ref> gave polynomials for the coordination sequences for d 7, and the preceding argument now justifies these formulae. <p> We had already determined the coordination sequence for D 4 some years ago (see Sequence M5182 of [24] 2 , and also (1)), and it was given independently by O'Keeffe <ref> [18] </ref>, who also found the coordination sequences for D 5 and D 6 . <p> The dual lattice D fl d and the generalized b.c.c. net As was pointed out in <ref> [18] </ref>, the contact graph for D fl d , for d 5, is simply the union of two disjoint copies of the contact graph for Z d . <p> The root lattices E 6 , E 7 , E 8 and their duals The coordination sequences for E 6 and E fl 6 were found experimentally by O'Keeffe <ref> [18] </ref>, so for these lattices we give only enough information to justify his results. E 6 . The contact polytope for the root lattice E 6 is the polytope called 1 22 in Coxeter's notation ([4], p. 104; [9], p. 201). There are 54 faces, all 5-dimensional hemicubes. <p> This is an integer, so E 6 is well-placed, and it is also easy to see that x = ht (x). Thus we have proved: Theorem 10. E 6 is well-coordinated. This establishes the coordination sequence S (n) = 5 63 n; (n &gt; 0) (36) found empirically in <ref> [18] </ref>. Also G (n) = 10 117 n 5 + 4 267 n 2 + 10 E fl 6 . The contact polytope for the dual lattice E fl 6 is a diplo-Schlafli polytope ([4], p. 104), and coincides with the Voronoi polytope for E 6 . <p> All faces are of this type. From this it is easy to obtain: Theorem 11. E fl 6 is well-coordinated. This establishes the coordination sequence S (n) = 18n 5 + 30n 3 + 6n (n &gt; 0) (38) found empirically in <ref> [18] </ref>. Also G (n) = 3n 6 + 9n 5 + 15n 4 + 15n 3 + 9n 2 + 3n + 1 : (39) The remaining three lattices are not well-placed, although they are well-rounded. E 7 . <p> Theorem 7). For n 4 our values for the coordination sequence S (n) do not agree with those given in <ref> [18] </ref>; we believe the latter are incorrect. Again, the fact that E 8 is not well-coordinated is responsible for the complicated formula in (52). <p> Remarks. We established (but did not publish) this result in Dec. 1993. It is stated as a conjecture by O'Keeffe <ref> [18] </ref>. The assertion on p. 801 of [16] that any Barlow packing has G (2) = 57 is plainly incorrect. See also Section 3 of [8]. 23 Proof.

Reference-contexts: The lattice is well-coordinated, G (n) and S (n) (n &gt; 0) are polynomials of degrees d and d 1 respectively, and the crystal balls are ambo-orthoplexes. We had already determined the coordination sequence for D 4 some years ago (see Sequence M5182 of <ref> [24] </ref> 2 , and also (1)), and it was given independently by O'Keeffe [18], who also found the coordination sequences for D 5 and D 6 .

Reference-contexts: As in the work of Brunner and Laves [2], O'Keeffe [17], [18], Grosse-Kunstleve [15] and others, in our examples G will usually be the contact graph of a d-dimensional lattice packing [6] or net <ref> [29] </ref>, formed by taking the vertices to be the points of the lattice or net and joining each point to its closest neighbors. Although we will not study it here, there is another way to construct a graph from a lattice that has some advantages over the contact graph.
