Abstract: Current navigation mechanisms for the World Wide Web promote a depth-first search for information on pages in hyperspace. This search strategy frequently results in the unintentional and often undesirable behavior of web surfing a user starts off in search of some information, but is sidetracked by tangential links. We propose a set of mechanisms based on breadth-first traversal that are better suited for directed searching. We have implemented our ideas as a scratchpad by augmenting an existing browser. Such a system makes web navigation both faster and easier.

Reference-contexts: Another technique commonly supported by browsers involves spawning a new browser window for each spoke of interest. The new browsers quickly become very difficult to manage, and even more quickly consume the user's most important resource: screen real estate. DeckScape <ref> [1] </ref>, an experimental browser, seeks to avoid this problem by using the concept of decks. Every deck is a linear stack of pages that the user can leaf through.

Reference-contexts: This process is repeated until either the needed information is found or the current search path is abandoned. When a search path is abandoned, the user jumps to a previous page using some history mechanism such as a Back button. Catledge and Pitkow <ref> [2] </ref> refer to this process as the hub-and-spoke strategy, where the user follows a path from the start page or the hub, ending at a spoke, and then returns to the hub to start another spoke. <p> Many researchers have focused on efficient history mechanisms to enable the user to get back to the hub with a low number of user actions [13]. Catledge and Pitkow <ref> [2] </ref> also state that these complex history mechanisms are often not used; 41% of the user actions involve the browser's Back button. This large number of user actions could be avoided altogether by having a navigation mechanism that eliminates the need to revisit the hub.

Reference-contexts: Backtracking is often difficult since the context in which that page was being viewed has been forgotten. Frequently, entire sub-trees are accidentally skipped because users do not remember what their intentions had been when an earlier hub was last being viewed [4]. Chang and Chi <ref> [3] </ref> point out that using a depth-first strategy, the user loses more overall perspective the further he/she goes down through the layers. Visiting any more than a few pages before revisiting some hub page may mean that the context for that page has been forgotten.

Its main drawback is that it occupies a large portion of the screen. WebNet <ref> [4] </ref> is a browser extension that displays a graphical representation of the hyperspace being explored. It does so dynamically, and independent of the content provider. In fact it can do so across many sites.

Reference-contexts: In fact there are several problems with the Chimera user interface that prevent it from being suitable for extended use. We plan to reimplement our modifications by building a new prototype based on the Netscape Open Source browser <ref> [6] </ref>. In this system the scratchpad and the browser will be more tightly coupled. The resulting system should be robust enough to be tested by users, and will provide a better environment in which to evaluate our techniques.

Reference-contexts: It is a challenge, however, to present the graph in such a way that the contextual information is highlighted. More generally, it is not clear how much is gained by a graphical representation, or how easy it would be to internalize that information. Fisheye mechanisms <ref> [7] </ref> are among those techniques used to prevent information overload, but in any case, they are only able to show syntactic information, not semantic information. Elastic Windows [8] also provides a mechanism that illustrates graphically the hyperspace in which a user is navigating, but it does so more interactively.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, none of the existing methods address other characteristics of the underlying medium such as highly scattered information and user-perceptible network latencies. A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM In this section we describe our prototype system. We have incorporated the breadth-first mechanism and dogears into Chimera-1.70 <ref> [9] </ref>. The browser is written in C and runs under X-Windows using the Athena widget set. We also demonstrate the use of the system by describing a sample web browsing session.

Reference-contexts: We assert that it is important for web navigation techniques to facilitate efficient hypertext traversal of a fundamentally different sort. MOTIVATION AND GOALS Most current web navigation techniques are based on the paradigm of depth-first traversal <ref> [10] </ref>; users select a link on the current page which loads a new page, and displays it. This process is repeated until either the needed information is found or the current search path is abandoned.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, web surfing is an example of undirected web browsing. While surfing, the user simply selects interesting links as they appear, obtaining new information without any firm goals regarding the target information.

Reference-contexts: Two types of systems present graphical maps through which a user may navigate. Some are like HTML frames in that they are created once by the content provider. Others are created on the fly by the web browser. WebTOC <ref> [12] </ref> is an automated system for creating table of contents (TOC) frames for sets of web pages. The TOC frame can be quite useful, and having that frame actually run a Java program allows it to more dynamically present the desired information.
