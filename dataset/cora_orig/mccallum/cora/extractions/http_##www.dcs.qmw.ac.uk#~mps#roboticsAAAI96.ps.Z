Title: Noise and the Common Sense Informatic Situation for a Mobile Robot  
Author: Murray Shanahan 
Address: Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, England.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary and Westfield College,  
Abstract: Any model of the world a robot constructs on the basis of its sensor data is necessarily both incomplete, due to the robots limited window on the world, and uncertain, due to sensor and motor noise. This paper supplies a logical account of sensor data assimilation in which such models are constructed through an abductive process which hypothesises the existence, locations, and shapes of objects. Noise is treated as a kind of non-determinism, and is dealt with by a consistency-based form of abduction.

Reference-contexts: Incompleteness is a consequence of the robots limited window on the world, and uncertainty results from noise in its sensors and actuators. This section deals with noise. Both noisy sensors and noisy actuators can be captured using non-determinism. (An alternative is to use probability <ref> [Bacchus, et al., 1995] </ref>). Here well only look at the uncertainty in the robots location that results from its noisy motors. The robots motors are noisy for various reasons.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm forms the core of an implementation in C, which runs on data acquired by the robot in the real world. Some preliminary experiments have been conducted in which the robot, under the control of a behaviour-based architecture <ref> [Brooks, 1986] </ref>, explores an enclosure, and makes a record of its actions and sensor data for subsequent processing using the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The Cognitive Robotics approach is in marked contrast to that of Brooks and his followers. According to Brooks, work in the style of Shakey is flawed because, it [relies] on the assumption that a complete world model [can] be built internally and then manipulated. <ref> [Brooks, 1991a] </ref> A complete model of the world is hard for a robot to construct because, as Brooks points out, the data delivered by sensors are not direct descriptions of the world as objects and their relationships [and] commands to actuators have very uncertain effects.

Reference-contexts: This definition is very liberal, and the full paper utilises a boundary-based representation of shape to render the space of possible explanations more manageable (see <ref> [Davis, 1990, Chapter 6] </ref>). 3 Noise as Non-Determinism The hallmark of the common sense informatic situation for a mobile robot is incomplete and uncertain knowledge of a world of spatio-temporally located objects. <p> These theorems have been used to prove the correctness, with respect to the abductive specification given, of an algorithm for sensor data assimilation which constructs an occupancy array <ref> [Davis, 1990, Section 6.2.1] </ref>. This algorithm forms the core of an implementation in C, which runs on data acquired by the robot in the real world.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The aim of Cognitive Robotics is to design and build mobile robots based on the idea of logical representation [Lesprance, et al., 1994]. By reinstating the ideals of the Shakey project <ref> [Nilsson, 1984] </ref>, Cognitive Robotics has reinvigorated a research programme that has been largely dormant for the past twenty years.

Reference-contexts: Develop a formalism for representing action, continuous change, space and shape. 2. Using this formalism, construct a theory of the robots interaction with the world. 3. Consider the process of sensor data assimilation as a form of abduction, following <ref> [Shanahan, 1989] </ref>. This section concerns the first of these steps. For more details, see [Shanahan, 1996b]. To begin with, we have a formalism for reasoning about action and continuous change, based on the circumscriptive event calculus of [Shanahan, 1995b].

Reference-contexts: Displace (g,x,y) denotes the region obtained by displacing g by x units east and y units north. x1,y1 Displace (g,x2,y2) (Sp7) x1x2,y1y2 g For reasons set out in <ref> [Shanahan, 1995a] </ref>, a means of default reasoning about spatial occupancy is required. This is done by minimising the predicate AbSpace in the presence of the following axiom. AbSpace (w) Initially (Occupies (w,g)) (Sp8) Let O denote the conjunction of (Sp1) to (Sp8).

Reference-contexts: This section concerns the first of these steps. For more details, see [Shanahan, 1996b]. To begin with, we have a formalism for reasoning about action and continuous change, based on the circumscriptive event calculus of <ref> [Shanahan, 1995b] </ref>. A many sorted language is assumed, with variables for fluents, actions (events), and time points. We have the following axioms, whose conjunction will be denoted CEC. Their main purpose is to constrain the predicate HoldsAt. HoldsAt (f,t) represents that fluent f holds at time t.

Reference-contexts: However, care must be taken when domain constraints and triggered events are included. The former must be conjoined to CEC, while the latter are conjoined to N. A detailed account of this solution is to be found in <ref> [Shanahan, 1996a, Chapter 16] </ref>. To construct a theory of the robots interaction with the world, a means of representing space and shape is required. Space is assumed to be ~ 2 . Objects occupy regions, which are open, path-connected subsets of ~ 2 . <p> There will, naturally, be many explanations for any given Y which meet this definition, even using the boundary-based representation of shape adopted in the full version of the paper. A standard way to treat multiple explanations in abductive knowledge assimilation is to adopt their disjunction <ref> [Shanahan, 1996a, Chapter 17] </ref>. This has the effect of smothering any explanations which are stronger than necessary, such as those which postulate superfluous obstacles. The disjunction of all explanations of Y is the cautious explanation of Y. A variety of preference relations over explanations can also be introduced.

Reference-contexts: Section 1 presents a generic formalism for reasoning about action and space. Section 2 applies this formalism to the mobile robot under consideration, and presents an abductive characterisation of sensor data assimilation. A more detailed presentation of the material in these two sections is to be found in <ref> [Shanahan, 1996b] </ref>. The next two sections focus on the issue of noise. <p> Using this formalism, construct a theory of the robots interaction with the world. 3.
