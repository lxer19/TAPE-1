Reference-contexts: A cohesive and comprehensive theory is necessary to manage this vast collection of interoperable objects. The theories and algorithms that will support this paradigm are the key research issue of the Infospheres Group at Caltech <ref> [1] </ref>. 1 The Internet of Today The Internet of today evaluates and adopts technologies at a amazingly rapid pace given it is a collective of several million souls. Technologies are accepted if they are useful, easy to understand and operate, and empower users and developers.

Reference-contexts: We now have worldwide sharing of documents, object request brokers that support distributed object-based client-server applications, enterprise-wide collaboration systems and, most importantly, network-centric computing has come to a head. Companies like Microsoft, Sun and Netscape have made networking-aware products their primary mission <ref> [2] </ref>. However, a worldwide network of persistent objects, akin to today's worldwide network of telephones, cannot be made a reality merely by deploying current technology; basic research remains to be done.

Reference-contexts: The solutions we propose are based on open standards and software. Our implementation uses Java <ref> [3] </ref>, widely available network protocols, and the Web, but the ideas apply immediately to many software platforms. 2 Relevant Technologies A number of existing and developing technologies will play key roles in the creation of a Worldwide Object Network. 2.1 Fully-Deployed Technologies Those technologies that we would call "fully adopted" are

Reference-contexts: The software messiahs are, for the most part, in the form of standards and frameworks. We have the epic battle for the object-playground: DCOM, COM, and OLE <ref> [4] </ref> against CORBA [5]. The component battlefield is similar: ActiveX, Java Beans, and OpenDoc being the primary contenders. There are solid technologies that have never caught on (DCE) and vague ones that everyone seems to want to adopt (Netscape ONE).
