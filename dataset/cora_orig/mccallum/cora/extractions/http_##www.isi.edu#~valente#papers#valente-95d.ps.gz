Title: ON-LINE: An Architecture for Modelling Legal Information

Abstract: This paper describes ON-LINE (ONtology-based Legal INformation Environment), an architecture for a legal workbench which combines two major functions: legal information serving and legal analysis. Some of the main features of ON-LINE are: the integrated storage and representation of legal text and knowledge by using interconnected knowledge and text repositories; a representation of legal knowledge based on a functional ontology of law; the emphasis on legal modelling as a central task in legal practice. ON-LINE comprises three main modules. The Legal Information Server is able to retrieve legal information based on either textual or conceptual search. The Legal Information Modelling Toolkit is a collection of integrated tools to transform legal text into legal knowledge. The Legal Analysis Environment contains reasoning tools to perform two of the central legal tasks: assessment and planning. The architecture is intended to be a basis for experimentation, and it is therefore highly extensible. ON-LINE is partially implemented in Common Lisp and it is supported by the LOOM system.

Reference-contexts: These two main types of architectural facilities actually correspond to two major types of AI & Law applications. Legal information retrieval systems store legal sources in textual form, and offer a number of mechanisms for their retrieval <ref> [2] </ref>. AI techniques can be used in the retrieval process, e.g. by using a representation of legal concepts as a basis for search (see e.g. [11]). Legal analysis systems are abundant in the literature, and they comprehend most known legal expert systems.

This "world model" specifies which types of agents and objects are considered, how these are related in terms of types/sub-types (i.e. taxonomically), which behaviors may occur, etc. This type of knowledge is usually recognized as a terminological one, because it is specified through the definition of terms.

Reference-contexts: Most AI & Law systems belong to either one of these categories. One of the major (and innovative) functions of ON-LINE is to integrate legal information systems and legal analysis through modelling (see also section 3). 2.2 Ontological basis for legal knowledge represen tation Many legal information systems (e.g. <ref> [11, 7] </ref>) have employed a representation of the concepts used in a law as a twin representation of the text which was used for both searching and reasoning purposes | a technique named conceptual information retrieval. <p> The main extra of this Legal Information Server is that it is also able to search for information using the knowledge base. One can search for the term `software' (in the text base) or for the concept `software' (in the knowledge base). That is, ON-LINE enables conceptual retrieval (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). <p> However, there are many legal information systems and architectures which incorporate conceptual models of the underlying domain, i.e. of the world (and mainly definitional) knowledge. This has been called conceptual information retrieval. Some examples are the systems by [11] and <ref> [7] </ref>. These systems usually employ some sort of conceptual representation such as semantic networks and conceptual graphs which are very similar to the terminological knowledge representation used here. This can be viewed as a convergent view that this type of knowledge should be represented concept based. <p> This can be viewed as a convergent view that this type of knowledge should be represented concept based.

Reference-contexts: A conceptualization is a description of the objects, concepts and other entities which exist in a certain part of the world, as well as the relations between them. By identifying these terms and relations, one commits oneself to some domain of discourse <ref> [10] </ref>. AI has borrowed from philosophy the term ontology to mean a specification of of a conceptualization. 1 An ontology can be a conceptualization of an abstract concept, such as time, action, space, or of a domain. <p> What is called ontology in AI is perhaps closer to what has been called in philosophy an ontological theory: "a theory that contains and interrelates ontological categories, or generic concepts representing components or features in the world" [6, pag. 11].

The use of LOOM is a key factor in the implementation, since it provides sophisticated facilities for concept definition and search for free. Most ON-LINE facilities rely heavily on the corresponding LOOM facilities. For example, all the elements in the knowledge and text repositories are LOOM objects.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper presents ON-LINE (ONtology-based Legal INformation Environment), an architecture for storing and retrieving legal information and reasoning with legal knowledge. ON-LINE is partially implemented in a research prototype system, and is used to integrate and test proposed and formalized conceptualizations of legal knowledge representation and reasoning methods <ref> [15] </ref>. The representations are based upon an abstract ontology (summarized in section 2.2) that covers the legal domain [15, Chapter 4]. Part of the legal knowledge consists of the description of norms which are expressed as deontic functions. <p> ON-LINE is partially implemented in a research prototype system, and is used to integrate and test proposed and formalized conceptualizations of legal knowledge representation and reasoning methods [15]. The representations are based upon an abstract ontology (summarized in section 2.2) that covers the legal domain <ref> [15, Chapter 4] </ref>. Part of the legal knowledge consists of the description of norms which are expressed as deontic functions. A formal account of these deontic functions, which provides an alternative for (standard) deontic logic approaches, has been presented in [16]. <p> Moreover, an algorithm which draws conclusions about the normative status of a case (allowed; not-allowed) has been developed as a core method for analyzing legal consequences [16]. Also representational solutions for other types of legal knowledge (world knowledge, causal/responsibility knowledge) have been developed <ref> [15] </ref>. In this paper, we focus on the multiple functions which these elements support when integrated into the architecture proposed. <p> In this paper, we focus on the multiple functions which these elements support when integrated into the architecture proposed. ON-LINE contains reasoning modules based on the models for legal assessment and legal planning developed in <ref> [17, 15] </ref>, as well as on supporting tools for legal modelling and design (drafting regulations). This integration of functions and support makes ON-LINE a legal workbench, rather than a legal expert system annex data-base. The key for the integration is the theoretical framework provided by the ontology. <p> These two parts specify how the world is `divided', i.e. which basic types of things are distinguished. 2.2.2 The Functional Ontology of Law The functional ontology of law, which is used as a representational foundation for ON-LINE, has been described in <ref> [15, Chapter 4] </ref>. Its description in the formal language 1 In philosophy, an ontology is a systematic account of existence. <p> The functional ontology of law has foundations in legal theoretical concepts from theorists and philosophers like Hart, Kelsen, Bentham and Lindahl. It is outside the scope of this paper to describe the ontology in full detail; the interested reader is referred to <ref> [15, Chapter 4] </ref>. Below, we will briefly characterize the main primitive categories of legal knowledge distinguished in the ontology: * normative knowledge consists of all knowledge, which role it is to specify which behaviours in the world are to be allowed, and which disallowed. <p> The categories discussed above are but the primitive ones. Other important categories of legal knowledge, such as rights and legal procedures, are defined in terms of the primitive ones, either as compositions or variations in form (see <ref> [15] </ref> for details). 2.3 Text and concepts: dual representation of legal information One of the ways to integrate information retrieval and legal analysis is a dual representation of legal information. ON-LINE stores this both as text (in a text base) and as knowledge (in a knowledge-base). <p> An important question is how these modules are integrated with the rest of the architecture. A complete discussion of the issue is outside the scope of this paper; the interested reader can find the complete discussion in <ref> [15] </ref>. Briefly, the solution to this problem is based on the use of knowledge-level models adapted from the CommonKADS Library [4] to specify the tasks implemented by the reasoning modules. These models describe the tasks using (functional) inference steps, and roles that domain knowledge plays in problem solving. <p> The adaptation corresponds to a mapping between the problem-specific roles to law-specific roles, i.e. we must verify which types of legal knowledge play these roles (for more details on the methods and the adaptation see [17], or <ref> [15, Chapter 7] </ref>). For instance, one of the steps in assessment in general is to abstract the description of a case by translating some terms into more abstract terms (commonly those used in a set of norms at hand). <p> All other categories of legal knowledge have their own languages which are not (directly) supported by LOOM. That the knowledge representation language of LOOM is used for world knowledge is not a coincidence. In <ref> [15, Chapter 6] </ref> we show that terminological knowledge representation, a type of concept-based representation of the family of semantic nets and conceptual graphs, is the most adequate type of formalism to represent legal world knowledge. The current version of the prototype system does not contain all facilities described. <p> Both forms are linked. The basis for the knowledge representations is a functional ontology of law <ref> [15, Chapter 4] </ref> as well as the specific formalisms proposed for normative [16] and world knowledge [15]. It also contains reasoning modules based on the models for legal assessment and legal planning [14] as well as supporting tools for legal modelling and design. <p> Both forms are linked.

The main features of ONLINE are the following: * Integrated storage and representation of text and knowledge. <p> The classes of documents are arranged in a hierarchy which can be extended by the user. The text base supports the storage of any tex tual source used in legal practice. * Ontology-based knowledge representation. The knowledge base is structured based on the proposed ontology <ref> [15, Chapter 4] </ref> | that is, the main classes of constructs are the ones proposed in the ontology. The knowledge representation of the legal information is used for both information retrieval and reasoning. * Information retrieval services.
