Abstract: We show that if there exists a p-selective set that is NP-hard under truth-table reductions, then every function that is computable in polynomial time by truth-table access to an NP oracle is computable in polynomial time by making at most O(log n) queries to an NP oracle. As a consequence, it follows that if there exists a tt-hard p-selective set for NP, then for all k &gt; 0; NP DT IME[2 n=log k n ]. Reporting progress on the question of whether every function that is computable in polynomial time by truth-table access to an NP oracle is computable in polynomial time by making at most O(log n) queries to an NP oracle, we show that if there is a constant k such that

Reference-contexts: It was shown by Selman [Sel92] that if PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)], then P = FewP and R = NP. Jenner and Toran <ref> [JT93] </ref> showed that if PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)], then for all k &gt; 0, NP DT IME [2 n= log k n ]. The question of whether PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)] implies P = NP is still open. <p> This is not a coincidence, for we prove the following assertion: If there is a p-selective set that is truth-table hard for NP, then PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)] 1 . As a corollary, it follows <ref> [JT93] </ref> that if every set in NP truth-table reduces to a p-selective set, then for all k &gt; 0, NP DT IME [2 n= log k n ]. We also report our progress on the question of whether PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)] implies P = NP. <p> This implies that v fl is not a valid string, which is a contradiction. 2 This completes the proof of the theorem. 2 Jenner and Toran <ref> [JT93] </ref> proved that PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)] implies that for all k &gt; 0, NP DT IME [2 n= log k n ].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As NP-hard problems continue to resist polynomial time solutions, researchers in computational complexity have investigated sets for which some partial information can be extracted in polynomial time. The class of p-selective sets, introduced by Selman <ref> [Sel79] </ref>, is an example of such a class of sets.

Our first result connects the question of whether there exist p-selective tt-hard sets with the following question about function classes <ref> [Sel92] </ref>: Is the class of functions computable in polynomial time by nonadaptive access to an NP oracle included in the class of functions computable by at most O (log n) queries to an NP oracle? (in notation, is PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)]?). <p> It was shown by Selman <ref> [Sel92] </ref> that if PF NP tt PF NP [O (log n)], then P = FewP and R = NP.
