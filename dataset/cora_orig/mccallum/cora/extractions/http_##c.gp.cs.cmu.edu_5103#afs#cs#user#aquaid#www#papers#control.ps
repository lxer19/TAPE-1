Abstract: Planar linear motors (Sawyer motors) have been used in industry as open-loop stepping motors, but their robustness and versatility has been limited. Using a sensor recently integrated into such a motor, a closed-loop 3-DOF controller has been implemented. The software-based control system consists of a commutator for computing amplifier currents from actuator forces, a force resolution function for solving the redundant actuation and saturation problems, and an observer for producing a velocity estimate, together with a PID controller. Experiments are performed using a 2-axis laser interferometer to show that the controller has sub-micron resolution, 2 m peak-to-peak repeatability, and settling times after trajectories of about 20 ms. Limitations of the PID controller are discussed and ideas for improvements are presented.

Reference-contexts: They can move with velocities of several meters per second and accelerations of several g's. However, due to the lack of a suitable position sensor, they have been operated as open-loop stepping motors. It was recognized early that performance could be enhanced through sensing <ref> [1] </ref>, but early attempts to develop sensors were not very successful. Recently, prototype sensors have been designed and developed. In [2] a 1-DOF magnetic platen sensor was mounted on an outrigger off a commercial planar motor, and a PID controller was implemented, although few results are presented.

Reference-contexts: Recently, prototype sensors have been designed and developed. In [2] a 1-DOF magnetic platen sensor was mounted on an outrigger off a commercial planar motor, and a PID controller was implemented, although few results are presented. In <ref> [3] </ref> a 1-DOF sensor of a different design was similarly mounted, and preliminary results for PD control suggested improved resolution, stiffness, and settling times. Our group has recently completed development of a compact 3-DOF magnetic platen sensor.

Reference-contexts: It has been integrated into the center of a commercial planar linear motor, in space that was otherwise wasted, and has a linear resolution (1) of 0.2 m and an angular resolution of 0:0014 ffi . With sensing (described in a companion paper <ref> [4] </ref>) and closed-loop control (the subject of this paper), planar linear motors have the potential for much wider application. Guarded moves, fault detection, automatic registration, compliant motions, and cooperative manipulation are some of the Four linear motors combine to provide a 3-DOF force capability. <p> Note that points with jy t j = 75 mm correspond to the edge of the forcer. Because the sensor measures angle by differencing two parallel position measurements that are close together (see <ref> [4] </ref>), there is a low-noise sweet spot in the middle of the forcer, where the sensor is located.

An integral platen sensor provides 3-DOF sensing for closed-loop control. abilities possible with closed-loop control. In <ref> [5] </ref>, an adaptive controller for a 3-DOF planar motor is presented with simulation results, although sensor noise and actuator saturation appear to be neglected.

Reference-contexts: The coil currents can also be microstepped by applying a sine wave to one coil and a cosine wave to the other. A more detailed presentation of open-loop operation can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 1 Here, motor refers to one of the four actuators on the forcer, and planar linear motor refers to the entire device. 2488 the motor coils generate magnetic flux (dark flux path) that sums with the permanent magnet flux (light flux path) to produce forces.

Reference-contexts: An inversion of this model is then used for commutation. As described more fully in <ref> [7] </ref>, each linear motor segment generates forces according to the equation: f x1 = f (i x1 ; x 1 ; x1 ) p where x 1 is the motor position in its direction of force generation, p is the pitch of the motor, and x1 is the motor phase commanded <p> There are an infinite number of solutions, but as introduced in <ref> [7] </ref>, two interesting possibilities are a fixed amplitude solution, where i x1 is set to a constant value and x1 is varied according to f x1 , and a fixed phase solution, where x1 is chosen constant relative to the motor position and i x1 is varied. <p> At high speeds, it is also important to add phase advance to compensate for the latency between the sensor reading and the control output <ref> [7] </ref>. 2489 This term requires a velocity estimate.

Reference-contexts: For comparison, the tracking experiment was repeated under open-loop control. However, it would be unfair to have the open-loop controller attempt to track the same bang-bang acceleration trajectories. Instead, the trajectory described in <ref> [8] </ref> was implemented. This trajectory is identical to the bang-bang acceleration trajectory, except for burst (step changes applied to the desired position) and acceleration rolloff as the velocity increases.
