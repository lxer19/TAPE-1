Title: Sensor Based Motion Planning: The Hierarchical Generalized Voronoi Graph  
Author: Howie Choset, Joel Burdick,

Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University,  California Institute of Technology,  
Abstract: The hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (HGVG) is a roadmap that can serve as a basis for sensor based robot motion planning. A key feature of the HGVG is its incremental construction procedure that uses only line of sight distance information. This work describes basic properties of the HGVG and the procedure for its incremental construction using local range sensors. Simulations and experiments verify this approach.

Reference-contexts: In [16], an incremental approach to create a Voronoi diagram-like structure, which is limited to the case of a plane, was introduced. Prior work (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) describes the Voronoi graph, an extension of the Voronoi diagram into higher dimensions. The Voronoi graph is the locus of points in m dimensions equidistant to m point sites. <p> A point c is within line of sight of x if there exists a straight line segment that connects x and c without penetrating any obstacle. That is, c is within line of sight of x if for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, (x (1 t) + ct) is a point in FS. Let ~ C i (x) be the set of points on an object C i that are within line of sight of x, i.e., ~ C i (x) = fc 2 C i : 8t 2 [0; 1]; x <p> t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, (x (1 t) + ct) is a point in FS. Let ~ C i (x) be the set of points on an object C i that are within line of sight of x, i.e., ~ C i (x) = fc 2 C i : 8t 2 [0; 1]; x (1 t) + ct 2 FSg: Let c i = argmin d X i (x), i.e., c i is the closest point on the convex obstacle C i to x.

Reference-contexts: One class of heuristic algorithms is a behavioral based approach in which the robot is armed with a simple set of behaviors such as following a wall <ref> [2] </ref>. A hierarchy of cooperating behaviors forms more complicated behaviors such as exploration. An extension of this type of approach is called sequencing [11]. Since there are strong experimental results indicating the utility of H. Choset and J.

Reference-contexts: Though the GVG introduced in this work appears to be new, a disconnected GVG-like structure for SE (3) is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. The GVG can be thought of as the natural extension of the GVD into higher dimensions. However, unlike the GVD, the GVG is not necessarily connected in dimensions greater than two, and thus, in general, is not a roadmap.

Reference-contexts: Roadmaps are one of the complete classical methods. An example of a complete roadmap scheme is Canny and Lin's Opportunistic Path Planner (OPP) <ref> [4] </ref>. Rimon adapted this motion planning scheme for sensor based use [17], but, connectivity of the roadmap in [17] cannot be guaranteed without "active perception." Furthermore, from a practical point of view, there are two detractions to Rimon's method. <p> Furthermore, we have found that our incremental construction procedures are not only sensor implementable, but numerically efficient. Finally, the incremental construction techniques described in this section can be adapted to other sensor based planning methods such as the OPP (described in <ref> [4, 17] </ref>). The HGVG's properties of accessibility, departabil-ity and connectivity translate to incremental accessibility, incremental departability, and traceability, respectively, in the incremental construction procedure. This section describes how to move onto (incremental accessibility) and trace along (traceability) the GVG using only local information. Incremental departability is described in Section 8. <p> Gradient ascent would then be used to move back onto the local edge. The OPP Sensor Based Motion Planning: The Hierarchical Generalized Voronoi Graph <ref> [4] </ref> method and its sensor based adaptation [17] use this strategy with a fixed stepping direction. However, gradient ascent can be a computationally expensive procedure because of its slow convergence. Also, the constant step direction leads to undesirable roadmap artifacts [5].

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [5] </ref>, it was shown that D is not smooth, and thus does not have a conventional gradient.

Reference-contexts: See obstacles, then SS ij = S ij for all i; j. Using the Pre-image Theorem, it can be shown that SS ij is an (m 1)-dimensional manifold in R m (i.e., SS ij has co-dimension one) <ref> [6] </ref>.

With this link, the boundary of the second order generalized Voronoi region is connected. In prior work <ref> [6] </ref>, it is assumed that all GVG edges must have at least one meet point, and thus no GVG cycles can exist. This assumption is met in "cluttered" environments, which are the ones of most interest for sensor based planning.

Reference-contexts: The proof of the above appears in <ref> [7] </ref>. In general, this "prediction" step will take the robot off the GVG. Next, a "correction" method is used to bring the robot back onto the GVG. <p> The following proposition, whose proof appears in <ref> [7] </ref>, guarantees that Equation (12) is well defined: Proposition 2 (Equidistant Surface Full Rank Property) The matrix r y G (y; ) has full rank (i.e., has rank (m 1)) in a neighborhood of the GVG on the correcting plane.

Reference-contexts: A GVG edge may also terminate at a floating boundary point, denoted F C i 1 :::i m . At a floating boundary point, two distance function gradient vectors become collinear. The following proposition, whose proof appears in <ref> [9] </ref>, guarantees that the only terminating conditions for a GVG edge are meet points, boundary points, and floating boundary points. <p> We assume the sensors measure distance to nearby obstacles, along a fixed direction termed the sensor measurement axis. The sensor measurement axis is a function of the robot's position and orientation (See Figure 10). It is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that the distances to individual obstacles correspond to local minima in the sensor array. The distance gradient is the unit vector pointing along the sensor measurement axis. An example is depicted in H. Choset and J. Burdick the distances to the two closest obstacles. measurements is drawn. <p> It can be shown that on each two-equidistant face, F ij , the GVG 2 fi connects the boundaries of F ij if and only if the boundaries of the individual second order generalized Voronoi regions are connected (or can be readily connected with a link). <ref> [9] </ref> The rest of this section is now devoted to careful consideration of the structures on the boundary of a second order generalized Voronoi region. Furthermore, we show that these boundary structures are defined in terms of line of sight information and can be incrementally traced using range sensor data. <p> Furthermore, we show that these boundary structures are defined in terms of line of sight information and can be incrementally traced using range sensor data. A rigorous proof enumerating all of the structures in the boundary of a second order generalized Voronoi region is contained in <ref> [9] </ref>, but this result can be seen via inspection of Equation (14). The first inequality in Equation (14) is associated with the structures that exist on a common boundary of two second order generalized Voronoi regions on the same two-equidistant face.
