Abstract: The following two important features of human experts' knowledge are not realized by most evolutionary algorithms: one is that it is various and the other is that the amount of knowledge, including infrequently used knowledge, is large. To imitate these features, we introduce an activation value for individuals and a new variation-making operator, splitting, both of which are inspired by ecological systems. This algorithm is applied to the game of Go and a large amount of knowledge evaluated as appropriate by a human expert is acquired. Various kinds of Go knowledge may be acquired such as patterns, sequences of moves, and Go maxims, part of which has already been realized.

Reference-contexts: Human beginners also learn simple rules first and then gradually learn exceptions and more complicated rules. Food might be compared with the memory capacity of humans. While novices have much less memory capacity, their capacity gradually increases; experts have much larger capacity than novices <ref> [ Chase and Simon, 1973 ] </ref> . In this algorithm, the amount of food given for one training datum is determined by the F OOD parameter. As mentioned in Section 3.2, F OOD increases as the iteration continues.

Reference-contexts: One is that it is inflexible; knowledge representation is uniform such that the length of all strings is unique. The other is that in most cases acquired knowledge is limited to one kind; all rules tend to be similar <ref> [ Goldberg, 1989 ] </ref> in most algorithms. Moreover, algorithms can only acquire knowledge which is frequently used. These two characteristics of algorithms are far from those of human experts.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, our algorithm is appropriate for acquiring a large number of rules that can be described by Horn clauses, while GP is appropriate for acquiring a small number of optimal rules that are too complex to be described by Horn clauses. Classifier Systems Classifier Systems (CS) <ref> [ Holland et al., 1986 ] </ref> use many classifiers to solve problems, as does our algorithm. However, CS do not acquire the thousands of rules, which our algorithm does.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm may help us to build a learning model in an evolutionary way which learns as people do. This algorithm is applied to the game of Go, which has recently attracted considerable attention from AI researchers as the target next to chess <ref> [ Kitano and others, 1993; McCarthy, 1990 ] </ref> . Games have been used as a testbed for AI algorithms because they are well-defined and easy to use to test the algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In Go, a search space is so huge and moves are so sensitive to situations that most of the knowledge used by human players is the heuristic knowledge. In our previous studies <ref> [ Kojima et al., 1994; Kojima, 1995 ] </ref> , we built a system that deductively acquires Go patterns. Although the system acquires reliable patterns, it can only acquire strict rules, not heuristic ones.

Reference-contexts: Since our purpose is to acquire various rules, we adopted splitting. 4.3 Comparison with Other Evolutionary Algorithms Since our algorithm is a kind of an evolutionary algorithm, we compare it with other evolutionary algorithms in this section. Genetic Programming Among major evolutionary algorithms, only Genetic Programming (GP) <ref> [ Koza, 1992 ] </ref> admits flexible knowledge representation. It admits more flexible knowledge representation than our algorithm; while our algorithm admits only Horn clauses, GP admits any type of programs in describing rules.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, recent cognitive studies on Go players <ref> [ Saito and Yoshikawa, 1996 ] </ref> have revealed that human experts use Go knowledge such as "patterns" and also search a game tree a little; this shows the importance of Go knowledge to human players. Therefore, studying acquisition of Go knowledge may help Go playing systems to play better.

Reference-contexts: Thus, another approach in AI, the knowledge-intensive approach, should be considered. Go playing systems of this approach have a large amount of knowledge and search a small space resembling human experts <ref> [ Saito, 1996 ] </ref> . Thus, Go is considered to be an appropriate testbed for the knowledge-intensive approach. The knowledge-intensive approach is difficult to take because of the difficulty of acquiring a huge amount of knowledge. <p> Since this algorithm is flexible, other kinds of rules may be acquired. Human players are said to have not only patterns but also sequences of moves, which they consider important <ref> [ Saito, 1996 ] </ref> . Since the condition part of this algorithm can take any predicates, indexes of previous moves (for example, two moves before) can be a part of the condition. Thus, sequences of moves have already been acquired, although they are not mentioned in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Although the system acquires reliable patterns, it can only acquire strict rules, not heuristic ones. The two big problems in the present systems that acquire heuristic knowledge are that the acquired knowledge is localized and small, and that the knowledge representation is fixed. For example, one system <ref> [ Sei and Kawashima, 1994 ] </ref> collects from master's game records patterns, which are fixed diamond shape and whose area is within five Manhattan distances of the center. Our algorithm makes it possible to acquire more flexible knowledge; patterns with any shapes and of unlimited size can be acquired.

Reference-contexts: The other is that it can be a large amount; it is estimated that a chess master has between 10,000 and 100,000 chunks of knowledge <ref> [ Simon and Gilmartin, 1973 ] </ref> . As a consequence, experts also have knowledge which is infrequently used. In contrast, knowledge acquired by most evolutionary algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), has two features.
