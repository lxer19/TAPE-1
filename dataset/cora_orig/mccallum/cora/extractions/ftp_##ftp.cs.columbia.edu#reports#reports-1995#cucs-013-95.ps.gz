Reference-contexts: Hence there may be a large number of different possible paths leading to any one node in the composite rejector. Connections can also be drawn between our results and the large body of work on computationally motivated nearest neighbor classifiers [Friedman et al. 77] <ref> [Bentley 80] </ref> [Yianilos 93]. Though the problem we address is somewhat similar, namely, efficient classification, our setting is more general. The major novelty of our approach is the central role played by the pattern classes.

Reference-contexts: The step edge is the simplest and most widely explored feature. Efficient edge detectors have been proposed, however, the more sophisticated detectors (for instance, complete implementations of the Canny edge detector <ref> [Canny 86] </ref> and the Nalwa-Binford detector [Nalwa and Binford 86]) are less efficient. Furthermore, elaborate detectors are unavoidable in the case of more complex features, such as lines and corners, as shown in [Nayar et al. 95]. <p> This makes feature detection a prime candidate for the application of rejection theory. The major methods of edge detection are categorized in [Nalwa 93] by how they define the set, W f . Difference operators, such as the Canny edge operator <ref> [Canny 86] </ref> and the Marr-Hildreth operator [Marr and Hildreth 80], implicitly define W f in terms of the magnitude of the gradient (or the Laplacian), of the underlying image intensity function.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the widespread use of the K-L expansion allows us to argue that the class assumption can be expected to hold extensively. 4.4 Verifying the Class Assumption Since the K-L expansion may be computed efficiently (see for example <ref> [Chittineni 81] </ref> or [Murakami and Kumar 82]), we use it to validate the class assumption and moreover to find L i and c i .

Reference-contexts: The efficiency is shown to be a substantial improvement over the technique used in [Murase and Nayar 95], which similarly achieved perfect recognition. We also empirically illustrate logarithmic growth in the time complexity of the composite rejector. Further, when compared with Fisher's discriminant analysis <ref> [Duda and Hart 73] </ref>, the composite rejector is seen to be both significantly more efficient as well as more accurate. Discriminant analysis, even at its peak performance, has an error rate of slightly over 3%, in contrast to the error-free performance of the composite rejector. <p> A relationship can be established between our technique for rejector construction and Fisher's discriminant analysis [Fisher 36] <ref> [Duda and Hart 73] </ref>. In particular, our rejection vector will be seen intuitively to maximize between-class scatter, while keeping within-class scatter fixed at a low level. The major differences between rejection theory and discriminant analysis are the following: 1. Discriminant analysis is presented as a single level of processing. <p> This paper, in part, illustrates the relationship between the two. Pattern rejection can be regarded as an attempt to bring together ideas from the nearest neighbor literature, which is 1 A brief discussion on decision trees can also be found in <ref> [Duda and Hart 73] </ref>. 3 primarily concerned with complexity issues, and the pattern recognition literature, which is more concerned with representational issues. 3. A weakness of discriminant analysis is that there is little known about when it can be expected to work. <p> Since probabilistic models are meaningless in isolation and without a decision theory, we can regard the classes, W i , as being defined by, say, the Bayes decision rule <ref> [Duda and Hart 73] </ref>. 3 There are a number of ways in which the classes can be obtained [Fukunaga 90]. <p> from a normal distribu tion, projecting out the component in L n i=1 L i , and then normalizing to obtain a rejection vector that lies on the unit sphere, B. 10 This choice of rejection vector may be seen to be closely related to Fisher's discriminant analysis [Fisher 36] <ref> [Duda and Hart 73] </ref>. By working in a space orthogonal to L n i=1 L i , we are limiting the within-class scatter of each class, W i . Spreading out the points hr; c i i, maximizes the between-class scatter. <p> The graph is plotted using a log scale on the abscissa, implying a logarithmic growth rate in the time complexity. same test procedure, namely, setting aside half of the data, and using the other half to construct the classifier. Then, we constructed the Fisher spaces <ref> [Duda and Hart 73] </ref> of different dimensions. In Fisher space the classes consist of tight clusters, which we model as multivariate normal distributions. We computed the mean and covariance matrix of each of these distributions.

Reference-contexts: A relationship can be established between our technique for rejector construction and Fisher's discriminant analysis <ref> [Fisher 36] </ref> [Duda and Hart 73]. In particular, our rejection vector will be seen intuitively to maximize between-class scatter, while keeping within-class scatter fixed at a low level. The major differences between rejection theory and discriminant analysis are the following: 1. <p> d coordinates from a normal distribu tion, projecting out the component in L n i=1 L i , and then normalizing to obtain a rejection vector that lies on the unit sphere, B. 10 This choice of rejection vector may be seen to be closely related to Fisher's discriminant analysis <ref> [Fisher 36] </ref> [Duda and Hart 73]. By working in a space orthogonal to L n i=1 L i , we are limiting the within-class scatter of each class, W i . Spreading out the points hr; c i i, maximizes the between-class scatter. <p> This equation predicted that the required number of rejectors would be a logarithmic function of the number of objects. Using the same image database, we now compare the performance of the composite rejector against that of Fisher's discriminant analysis <ref> [Fisher 36] </ref>. Again, we followed the 16 and is labeled with the set of objects that it is designed to act on. At each node, only one inner product and a couple of comparisons need to be performed. Each leaf denotes a possible output of the composite rejector.

The major novelty of our approach is the central role played by the pattern classes. <p> The key is the number of possible outputs of the rejectors and the amount of intersection between them. This growth, rather than the time complexity, may well turn out to the limiting factor in the scalability of rejection. A comparison with the much less conservative k-d trees <ref> [Friedman et al. 77] </ref> would probably throw light on what is essentially a time-space tradeoff. 3. The class assumption is at the heart of our technique for constructing rejectors. As expected, it holds for some classes far more than for others.

One possibility is that the classes are derived using an analytical model of the underlying physical process, such as is the case in parametric feature detection [Nalwa 93] [Nayar et al. 95]. In many applications, however, modeling the underlying physical process proves extremely difficult. <p> Its true generality can be demonstrated by noting that it is approximately equivalent to assuming that the application of the K-L expansion <ref> [Fukunaga 90] </ref> [Oja 83] results in a compact and accurate representation of the class, W i .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We address the efficiency of pattern recognition, which is known to be vital when the number of classes involved is large. An example application in computational vision is object recognition, which in many cases can be reduced to a classical pattern recognition problem <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref>. Of particular importance in this context, is the growth rate of the recognition time as a function of the number of classes (objects). High efficiency also proves critical when the recognition algorithm must be applied a large number of times. <p> Hence, we expect the proposed rejection technique to be applied successfully in any application for which the K-L expansion is beneficial. We demonstrate the significance of pattern rejection via experiments on applications in appearance matching based object recognition <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref> and feature detection [Nayar et al. 95]. First, we constructed a composite rejector for a widely used image database of 20 objects, each of which constitutes a pattern class. The appearance of each object changes considerably as the pose of the object varies. <p> The appearance of each object changes considerably as the pose of the object varies. However, the composite rejector was able to completely, and without error, discriminate between all 20 objects. The efficiency is shown to be a substantial improvement over the technique used in <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref>, which similarly achieved perfect recognition. We also empirically illustrate logarithmic growth in the time complexity of the composite rejector. Further, when compared with Fisher's discriminant analysis [Duda and Hart 73], the composite rejector is seen to be both significantly more efficient as well as more accurate. <p> The data set is the same as used in <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref>. 5 Experiments The theory of pattern rejection is general and hence should find use in a variety of applications. Here, our objective is to demonstrate the generality, efficiency, and effectiveness of composite rejectors. <p> Recently, an alternative approach called appearance matching has gained popularity, where objects are modeled as collections of 2-D views [Edelman and Weinshall 91] [Poggio and Edelman 90] <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref>. The main advantages and limitations of appearance matching are described in [Murase and Nayar 95]. Similar view-based recognition techniques have also been applied to the problem of face recognition [Pentland et al. 94] [Brunelli and Poggio 93] [Sirovich and Kirby 87] [Turk and Pentland 91]. <p> Recently, an alternative approach called appearance matching has gained popularity, where objects are modeled as collections of 2-D views [Edelman and Weinshall 91] [Poggio and Edelman 90] <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref>.

Similar view-based recognition techniques have also been applied to the problem of face recognition [Pentland et al. 94] [Brunelli and Poggio 93] [Sirovich and Kirby 87] [Turk and Pentland 91]. <p> Also, we assume that the illumination of the environment remains more or less unchanged. Under these conditions, appearance matching, as described in <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref>, reduces object recognition to a classical pattern recognition problem. We first segment the object, and then scale by resampling the image so that the larger of the two object dimensions fits a preselected image size. In our implementation, the image size was 128 fi 128 pixels. <p> Since at each node there are at most 4 possible paths to take, making the decision consists of only two comparisons. This efficiency compares very favorably with the results obtained by Murase and Nayar <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref> on the same data. Their implementation based on the Karhunen-Loeve expansion required 20 inner products, followed by a sophisticated search procedure. <p> Further, given dedicated hardware to compute inner products, the rejector will yield even better improvement in performance since we require no complex search procedure. In cases where the composite rejector has leaves with multiple objects, tuned verifiers of the type used by Murase and Nayar <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref> can be used at the leaves to complete classification. We investigated the growth rate of the number of rejectors required as a function of the number of classes by considering subgraphs of the composite rejector. <p> Further study of when and why it holds would be useful. Given the derived relationship between rejection and the K-L expansion, this is equivalent to asking how well the K-L expansion can be expected to perform. This question was raised in the context of object recognition in <ref> [Murase and Nayar 95] </ref> and still remains unanswered in that application. 4. We have compared pattern rejection with Fisher's discriminant analysis and demonstrated rejection to be superior. Although discriminant analysis is formally "optimal," its optimality is more with respect to representation and not efficiency.

High efficiency also proves critical when the recognition algorithm must be applied a large number of times. This is the case in local feature detection <ref> [Nalwa 93] </ref> [Nayar et al. 95], where the detector needs to be applied at every pixel in an image.

The main advantages and limitations of appearance matching are described in [Murase and Nayar 95].

Reference-contexts: The main advantages and limitations of appearance matching are described in [Murase and Nayar 95]. Similar view-based recognition techniques have also been applied to the problem of face recognition [Pentland et al. 94] [Brunelli and Poggio 93] <ref> [Sirovich and Kirby 87] </ref> [Turk and Pentland 91]. In our experiments, we use appearance matching simply as an example of the large class of problems for which efficient rejectors can be constructed. For simplicity we assume a constrained environment.

Reference-contexts: A complete survey of work that use such a structure is well beyond the scope of this paper, but a small selection 1 is [Henrichon and Fu 69] [Payne and Meisel 77] <ref> [Weng 94] </ref>. In general, a composite rejector has a directed acyclic graph structure, as opposed to simply a tree structure, because there are many different orders in which classes may be rejected. <p> In particular, the relative performance is accounted for by the fact that child rejectors are individually constructed for reduced subsets of classes. Further, the second and subsequent Fisher vectors can be regarded as suboptimal when compared to the rejection vectors of the children in the composite rejector. Weng <ref> [Weng 94] </ref> uses a similar hierarchical structure which also takes advantage of this. 2. Whereas rejection is geared towards the computational efficiency of recognition, discriminant analysis is concerned with representational compactness. This paper, in part, illustrates the relationship between the two.

Reference-contexts: Hence there may be a large number of different possible paths leading to any one node in the composite rejector. Connections can also be drawn between our results and the large body of work on computationally motivated nearest neighbor classifiers [Friedman et al. 77] [Bentley 80] <ref> [Yianilos 93] </ref>. Though the problem we address is somewhat similar, namely, efficient classification, our setting is more general. The major novelty of our approach is the central role played by the pattern classes.
