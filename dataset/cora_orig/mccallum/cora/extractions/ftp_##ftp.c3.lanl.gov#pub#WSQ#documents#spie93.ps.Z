Abstract: The FBI has recently adopted a standard for the compression of digitized 8-bit gray-scale fingerprint images. The standard is based on scalar quantization of a 64-subband discrete wavelet transform decomposition of the images, followed by Huffman coding. Novel features of the algorithm include the use of symmetric boundary conditions for transforming finite-length signals and a subband decomposition tailored for fingerprint images scanned at 500 dpi. The standard is intended for use in conjunction with ANSI/NBS-CLS 1-1993, American National Standard Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint Information, and the FBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System.

The invertible linear transformation x ! fa 0 ; a 1 g induced by the analysis filter bank is called a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). <p> This is accomplished by using linear phase filters designed so that the downsampled SWT subbands will also be symmetric and can therefore be windowed (or truncated) with no loss of information.

The logarithmic factor was determined empirically to give good qualitative results when quantizing fingerprint images.

Reference-contexts: The compression algorithm selected by CJIS is based on adaptive uniform scalar quantization of a wavelet transform subband image decomposition and is referred to as the wavelet/scalar quantization (WSQ) standard. This particular approach was chosen on the basis of follow-up studies to the investigation reported in <ref> [3] </ref>, and the WSQ algorithm's suitability for fingerprint image data has been verified in tests performed by FBI fingerprint examiners. Testing has shown that the algorithm's compressed image quality is high enough to be acceptable for archival purposes at compression ratios of around 20:1. <p> Testing has shown that the algorithm's compressed image quality is high enough to be acceptable for archival purposes at compression ratios of around 20:1. The WSQ standard contains some elements of the LANL wavelet/vector quantization algorithm described in <ref> [3, 4] </ref> and has been developed jointly by CJIS and LANL. 2 OVERVIEW OF THE WSQ ALGORITHM An overview of the WSQ algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The syntax for compressed data is modelled closely on the syntax employed in the JPEG still image compression standard <ref> [5] </ref>. Two-byte markers are included to enable the decoder to parse the compressed bit-stream and locate side information|like table specifications|before decoding the compressed image data. The WSQ decoder parses the compressed data and extracts the tables needed in the decoding process. <p> Note that if C = 1=2 then the reconstructed value corresponding to each quantization bin is the bin's midpoint.

In much of the signal processing literature on amplitude quantization, however, the term "quantizer" is used for the composite quantizer characteristic function, F . <p> Transmission of the Huffman tables is accomplished by transmitting the array of codeword lengths and a corresponding list of symbols. The method employed for Huffman coding was adopted from the JPEG specification <ref> [5] </ref>, which contains many relevant suggestions that are helpful to the WSQ implementer.

Reference-contexts: The composite function F = D ffi E, which maps analog floating-point input to quantized floating-point output, is known as the quantizer characteristic <ref> [7] </ref> (e.g., see Figure 5). Within a single subband, the quantization intervals, or bins, are of equal width with the exception of the bin containing the origin (the zero bin), which is somewhat wider based on noise threshold estimates. <p> the decoding process doesn't undo the quantization of the coefficients effected by the encoder but merely maps discrete quantizer indices to discrete floating-point values, the terms "quantization decoder" and "quantized signal" seem more appropriate for D and ^a than "dequantizer" and "dequantized signal."

For realistic values of Q k , far fewer than this number of quantization levels will actually be needed; this implies the absence of quantizer overload distortion <ref> [7] </ref>.
