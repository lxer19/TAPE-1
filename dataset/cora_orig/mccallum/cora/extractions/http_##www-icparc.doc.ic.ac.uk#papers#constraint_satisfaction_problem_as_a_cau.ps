Title: Constraint Satisfaction Problem as a Causal Theory  
Author: Robert Rodosek 
Address: Theresienstrae 39, 80333 Munich, Germany  
Affiliation: University of Munich, Department of Computer Science  
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to identify and to characterize the features that render one class of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) computationally more efficient. Our approach is to search for a causal structure not only in the topology of the subsets of variables upon which the constraints are specified, but also in the nature of the constraints. Basically, there should exist an ordering of variables in the system such that an assignment of the variables can be reached without backtracking. First, an approach of a causal structure is formulated, and second, an efficient procedure is provided (i) for deciding if such an ordering of variables exists and, (ii) for identifying such an ordering whenever possible.

Reference-contexts: To investigate some different classes of the CSP we propose a more general representation, called a CT-graph. First, we introduce a k-cyclic hypergraph. For a classical definition of graphs and hypergraphs see <ref> [BERG 73] </ref>. Second, a formal definition of the CT-graph as a special 2-cyclic hypergraph is given and then 4 is examined what properties of the underlying relation are characterized by the topology of the CT-graph. Definition 7 (Hypergraph).

Reference-contexts: For such networks there exist a lot of results about sufficient conditions which are required by different search methods to solve the problem efficiently ([FREU 82], <ref> [DECH 88] </ref>). In this paper a causal model is proposed. Some conditions for CSP by discovering causal structures in constraint networks heve been found. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) ([DECH 91]) are used to represent the constraint network topology.

Reference-contexts: Some conditions for CSP by discovering causal structures in constraint networks heve been found. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) ([DECH 91]) are used to represent the constraint network topology. The main topic is the influence of the constraint network topology on the efficiency of the computation ([BEER 83], <ref> [PEAR 91] </ref>). Cause-effect relationships represent a certain class of the CSP and permit us to construct a solution in an efficient way. An example is the task of computing the output of an acyclic circuit, consisting of a large number of logical gates.

Reference-contexts: Given a CSP , a CT-graph G () is called legal if it satisfies the properties (p1),(p2),(p3) and (p4). In the scheduling applications we usually allow no overlapping of the tasks by using the same resource. For a definition of scheduling problems see [SADE 90], <ref> [RODO 93] </ref>. A typical scheduling constraint C (x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ) where x 1 and x 2 represent possible start times for two tasks and x 3 describes the decision if the tasks use the same resource or not, is a separate-hills constraint.
