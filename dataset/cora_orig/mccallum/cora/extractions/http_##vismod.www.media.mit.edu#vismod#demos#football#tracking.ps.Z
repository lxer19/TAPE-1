Title: Closed-World Tracking

Abstract: A new approach to tracking weakly modeled objects in a semantically rich domain is presented. We define a closed-world as a space-time region of an image sequence in which the complete taxonomy of objects is known, and in which each pixel should be explained as belonging to one of those objects. Given contextual object information, context-specific features can be dynamically selected as the basis for tracking. A context-specific feature is one that has been chosen based upon the context to maximize the chance of successful tracking between frames. Our work is motivated by the goal of video annotation - the semi-automatic generation of symbolic descriptions of action taking place in a contextually-rich dynamic scene. We describe how contextual knowledge in the football domain can be applied to closed-world football player tracking and present the details of our implementation. We include tracking results based on hundreds of images that demonstrate the wide range of tracking situations the algorithm will successfully handle as well as a few examples of where the algorithm fails.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, accurate motion estimates are difficult to obtain because they are compounded with camera motion and it is hard to define a reference point on a non-rigid, blob-like object from which to compute velocity. Finally, football players frequently collide. Color data, discussed in <ref> [7] </ref> provides more information that can be used for tracking, but it does not fundamentally solve the tracking problem. In this paper, we begin by presenting some previous approaches to tracking and we argue that they are severely inadequate for the low-resolution, amorphous, multiple-object tracking required. <p> present results of tracking football players that demonstrate the application of the technique on examples consisting of hundreds of frames. 2 Previous approaches for tracking Visual tracking usually employs one or some combination of the following methods: (1) correlation or 1 The entire sequence, results described in this paper, reference <ref> [7] </ref>, and more current work can be viewed at: http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod/demos/football/football.html. from pan/zoom video of a college football game. adaptive template correlation [19] that can create drifting templates, (2) energy-based deformable models [2, 21] that require good support from data and slowly changing objects (3) differential motion estimators [15, 6, 3] that <p> The difficulties of applying these methods to the football tracking problem are discussed in more detail in <ref> [7] </ref>. The use of high-level domain knowledge is not widespread in the tracking literature. Toal's work touches on the idea that non-geometric information can be used to improve vehicle tracking [18]. <p> Other field markings (such as the mid-field decal) are completely arbitrary. While there may be no simple way to obtain an exact geometrical specification of these objects, it is possible from the football video to reconstruct approximate pixel-based models for the given field (details available in <ref> [7] </ref>). Finally, amorphous objects are those that cannot be well-defined visually. In the football domain, the players are the amorphous objects since they change rapidly over time in complex ways that are hard to model, especially given the low-resolution, discretized data. <p> This is simple to do using a homographic transform (perspective four-point transform). This rectification was achieved automatically by tracking many line intersections and computing a least squares solution. Details can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. Once this is accomplished, at any player position we know which field objects are nearby. 4.2 Initialization Before tracking can begin, the position of each player in the original imagery must be identified so that closed-worlds can be localized and so that features can be chosen for tracking. <p> If no motion blob exists in the region around player, the player is assumed to be static and the player's previous closed-world is used at the current frame. For the details of the motion-based closed-world region finding algorithm, see <ref> [7] </ref>. 4.4 Pixel assignment and template formation for isolated players The goal is to construct a template of the player using information about other objects in the closed-world. <p> There are fourteen such test sequences with an average length of 113 frames and a maximum length of 240 frames. The test sequence, some frames of which are shown in Figure 1, has significant camera motion and zoom. A simple adaptive template tracker, described in <ref> [7] </ref>, will tend to drift from the player as the player moves over field objects, as shown in Figure 6-a. In comparison, Figure 6-b and Figure 6-c illustrate 200 frames of successful tracking of the same player using the closed-world technique. <p> A difficult field object for the tracker is the helmet field logo. However, the algorithm can successfully track players running over the helmet despite the similarity between the helmet intensities and the player. See <ref> [7] </ref> for this example and more results. The closed-world tracking, as described in this paper, will fail when (simultaneously) models are imprecise, spatial resolution is low, and the player being tracked is unusually close in appearance to some nearby object. One example is shown in Figure 6-g. <p> For two player closed-world tracking, we use pixel intensities as our discriminating features where we weight pixels based upon the most distinctive intensity ranges of offensive and defensive players and the officials. For details, see <ref> [7] </ref>. In short, the algorithm works as follows. When players are in separate closed-worlds and closed-world image region partitioning is good, all player pixels are used for tracking as described in section 4.

Reference-contexts: The Condor system treats objects as component parts of larger contexts from which they cannot be separated; objects have no independent existence. Strat notes that it is easier to design visual routines that work within some specified context than to construct general purpose algorithms. Finally, Mundy's MORSE system <ref> [11] </ref> will operate using a closed-world assumption that all data in a modelboard scene should be consistent with all the rules and objects known to exist in the domain. MORSE assumes a simple explanation for the closed space and then gradually works up to the most complicated examples.

Reference-contexts: Closed-worlds circumscribe the knowledge relevant to tracking and therefore reduce the complexity of the tracking problem. We note that a few other authors developed systems that use contextual information and approaches similar to our closed-worlds. Nagel <ref> [12] </ref> has hinted at using a closed-world assumption when building systems that extract conceptual descriptions from image sequences. He speculates that one way to improve motion recovery is to exhaustively model all types of motion expected within the given do main.
