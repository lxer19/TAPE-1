Abstract: In a simple cooperative MAS model where a collection of querying agents can send queries to a collection of information agents, we formalize the problem of designing strategies so that the expected completion time of the queries is minimized, when every querying agent uses the same strategy. We devise a provably optimal strategy for the static case with no query arrivals, and show via simulations that the same strategy performs well when queries arrive with a certain probability. We also consider issues such as whether or not the expected completion time can be reduced by sending multiple copies of queries, or by aborting copies of answered queries.

Reference-contexts: Such algorithms are therefore likely to play an important role in a MAS context. Despite this important difference, some of the techniques in stochastic scheduling research are useful for our purposes. For instance, we have used the concepts of ma-jorization and Schur convexity <ref> [1, 3, 9] </ref> to design our optimal randomized algorithm in Section 4. Several researchers in MAS have approached the problem of designing decentralized strategies from an economics viewpoint.

In all such work, the goal has been to design a centralized scheduling algorithm so that job completion times are reduced.

Reference-contexts: Researchers taking the economic viewpoint have proposed that pricing internet access can lead to a resolution of this dilemma [12, 14, 17, 18]. Some researchers [10, 15, 19, 20] are pursuing the design of decentralized strategies using models based on market equilibrium <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper we are formulating the decentralized strategy-design problem purely from a performance viewpoint: if each agent uses a strategy that leads to degraded performance for every agent, then that strategy is perhaps not an optimal one.
