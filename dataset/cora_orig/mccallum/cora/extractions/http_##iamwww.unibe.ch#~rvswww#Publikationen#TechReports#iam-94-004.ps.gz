Reference-contexts: A message which shall be sent by a tester must have concrete parameter values. Figure 24 presents the default constraint for an Information message which is send by a tester. The constraint refers to other parameter constraints. It has no Display parameter. The standard <ref> [3] </ref> requires that an Information message which is send by a subscriber has no Display parameter. Therefore the Information message definition declares Display as optional parameter.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to define several other operators to combine MSCs, but for test case specification we only need the operators sequence and alternative. However, a discussion on MSC operators can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. It is intended to include such operators in the MSC standard Z.120 [13].

Reference-contexts: introduction to the MSC language can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. The MSC in Figure 7 describes a part of the general message flow in Figure 4. The two SAPs of the ISDN system are represented by the individual axes A SAP and B SAP. The dependencies between events on different instance axes are defined explicitly by the SYNCHRONIZATION messages.

Reference-contexts: The TTCN notation for the sequences (1) and (10) can be found in Figure 18. For the complete understanding of step 3 more knowledge concerning the TTCN semantics might be necessary. But, in this chapter we only want to give an overall view. The details can be found in <ref> [11] </ref> and [18]. 4.2.3 Assigning test verdicts A TTCN test case assigns one of three test verdicts to a complete test run. We only assign the two verdicts pass and fail. This is due to the fact that industrial testing presupposes University of Berne, Institute for Informatics, Technical report no.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to define several other operators to combine MSCs, but for test case specification we only need the operators sequence and alternative. However, a discussion on MSC operators can be found in [6]. It is intended to include such operators in the MSC standard Z.120 <ref> [13] </ref>. One may argue that it is not necessary to structure test cases in a whole set of MSCs, but even the two possible postambles of our example show that it is necessary to include alternative MSCs in one test case description. <p> Within an MSC the statements of RL are related to messages. They can be found in parenthesis near the corresponding message name, or message arrow (cf. Figure 10). This is no extension of the MSC language, because the MSC standard <ref> [13] </ref> proposes to use expressions in round brackets to assign parameter information to messages. An RL statement consists of several parts. The parts are separated by semicolons. Each part may consist of several subparts which are separated by commas.

Reference-contexts: The dynamic part of a TTCN test case description specifies the control flow of the executable test case. In order to understand the algorithm we have to introduce the TTCN language briefly. 11 11 A more complete tutorial on TTCN can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter we do not want to describe the details of RL, but an example shall give an impression of the reference mechanism. The details can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. The MSC in Figure 26 is the testbody of the test case EDSAOUX (cf. Figure 10). The inscription of the Information messages ( ; Display:DisplayEDSAOUX) states that University of Berne, Institute for Informatics, Technical report no.
