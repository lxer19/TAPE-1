Abstract: Today's large and complex telecommunication networks produce large amounts of alarms daily. The sequence of alarms contains valuable knowledge about the behavior of the network, but much of the knowledge is fragmented and hidden in the vast amount of data. Regularities in the alarms can be used in fault management applications, e.g., for filtering redundant alarms, locating problems in the network, and possibly in predicting severe faults. In this paper we describe TASA (Telecommunication Alarm Sequence Analyzer), a novel system for discovering interesting regularities in the alarms. In the core of the system are algorithms for locating frequent alarm episodes from the alarm stream and presenting them as rules. Discovered rules can then be explored with flexible information retrieval tools that support iteration. The user interface is hypertext, based on HTML, and can be used with a standard WWW browser.

Reference-contexts: Rules can be pruned and ordered according to various attributes of the rules, e.g., the alarm type, severity, rule confidence and frequency, and statistical significance of the rules. Additionally, rules can be pruned with templates <ref> [5] </ref>, i.e., simple regular expressions that describe the form of rules that are to be selected or rejected. This technique is surprisingly powerful.

Reference-contexts: Just like episode rules, all association rules are found in one run, and then the rule presentation tools are used to browse the set of discovered associations. The algorithm for discovering association rules is described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Visualization of information is obviously an important part of knowledge discovery applications. Currently, the TASA system offers only simple facilities for this. For instance, a histogram of the distances between alarms of a certain type can be useful in understanding the distribution of alarms, e.g., their periodicities.

Reference-contexts: Episode rules A ! B (0:8) | -z - &lt;60 sec AB; C D 15 sec ! E (0:6) TASA discovers so called episode rules. Intuitively they state that when there occurs a certain combination of alarms there will soon occur a specified alarm <ref> [7] </ref>. For instance: 1. If alarm A occurs, then alarm B occurs within 30 seconds with probability 0.8. 2. If alarms A and B occur within 5 seconds, then alarm C occurs within 60 seconds with probability 0.7. 3. <p> The minimum frequency of rules has ranged from ten occurrences per day to two per week. Note that TASA finds all rules that fulfill the given criteria. The idea is then to let an expert interactively explore the large set of rules. For the algorithms and experimental results see <ref> [7] </ref>. Rule presentation What kind of rules are useful or interesting varies from one situation to another, and it is often impossible for an expert to specify what is interesting before seeing what the results are like.
