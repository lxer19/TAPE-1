Abstract: Since scalp EEG recordings are measured in microvolts, electrical interference may easily interfere during an experiment. As Spehlmann discusses, such interference may be introduced through the lights in the recording room, a nearby television, or even a computer monitor [Spehlmann, 1991]. Thus, when we considered performing EEG/EP/ERP experiments within a virtual reality helmet containing an eye tracker, electrical interference became a real possibility which needed to be explored. We tested the effects of wearing a VR4 virtual reality (VR) helmet containing an ISCAN eye tracker while asking subjects to do a continuous performance task. The results of this task were then analyzed in the frequency domain and compared to results from the same experiment while looking at a two different kinds of computer screen. Results indicate that the vertical refresh of a computer monitor may add more noise to the signal than wearing the VR helmet and eye tracker.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The use of virtual reality (VR) and eye tracking during EEG experiments promises to be beneficial. Virtual reality can provide dynamic and controllable experimental environments and eye tracking allows a comparison between cognitive behavior as associated with eye movement and through the EEG signal. While <ref> [Nelson et al., 1997] </ref> recorded EEG signals in a virtual environment, the environment in question consisted of a large screen in front of the subject. This screen posed less of a problem with noise than we assumed a virtual reality helmet sitting on the head of a subject would.

Reference-contexts: The analog frequency range was from 0.3 Hz to 300 Hz. While this is a rather large range, our interest in examining noise justifies the range. A Neuro Scan Acquisition system was then used to digitally record the signals at a rate of 1000 Hz. Discovered in the 1960's <ref> [Sutton et al., 1965] </ref>, the P300 is an easily evoked positive waveform around 300 ms after infrequent task-related stimuli. We decided that subjects should perform a task to evoke a P300 in order to make sure that the recorded EEG signal epochs were comparable in the frequency range.

Reference-contexts: After carefully reading the manual for the helmet, it was discovered that the helmet signal was sent at a rate of 60 Hz due to its use of the NTSC timing format <ref> [Systems, 1994] </ref>. While recording during the first experiment, the 60 Hz notch filter was on and thus a potential problem with the VR helmet signal was avoided.
