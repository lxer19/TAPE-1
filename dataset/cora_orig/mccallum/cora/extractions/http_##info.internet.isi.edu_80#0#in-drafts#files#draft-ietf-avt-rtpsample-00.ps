Reference-contexts: Obtaining a group size estimate generally requires a participant to maintain a list of group members. As this can require significant memory, particularly for embedded systems, RTP <ref> [1] </ref> has been revised to allow for a statistical sampling procedure which allows the memory size to be bounded for all group sizes. This algorithm operates by applying an SSRC mask with m bits equal to one to each packet received. Initially, m starts at 0.
