Abstract: An approach to integration of the analytical and empirical learning strategies for solving the theory-based concept specialization problem is proposed. The emphasis is on learning correct concepts within conjunctive description language isolated from supplied domain theory. In order to overcome expressive limitations of such language, the analytical learning component is guided by a speciflc empirical version space technology. The approach learns incrementally a correct pure conjunctive or DNF concept deflnition in dependance on the domain theory.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The theory-based concept specialization problem (TBCS), deflned in <ref> [1] </ref> and [5], requires a more general formulation for practical applications. <p> Most of the previous works deal only with speciflc cases of the above TBCS problem and solve these cases by integrated empirical-after-analytical learning approaches: IOE <ref> [1] </ref>, MECEA [5]. They produce a complete and consistent pure conjunctive concept deflnition of SC when the domain theory determines a suf-flciently expressive concept description language. When the language expres-sivenes is insu-cient ( i.e., the deflnition of SC is DNF ), these approaches fail. <p> Second, when the boundary sets are not focused, an incompletely learned deflnition of the concept SC is generated. Depending on the power of the set S, the resulting concept deflnition is pure conjunctive or DNF. 4 Comparisons and Relevance to Other Works MESFA and IOE <ref> [1] </ref> are two approaches to solving the TBCS problem. IOE uses domain theory to build an explanation only from the positive examples and forms deflnitions of SC by an empirical technique over the explanation.

Reference-contexts: It is proven 1 that all subsets C of CDL DT possess the properties convexity and deflniteness <ref> [2] </ref>. Therefore, the subsets of CDL DT are representable by boundary sets and admit version space learning. MESFA distinguishes by supporting all hypothetical concept deflnitions in form of a disjunctive version space: Deflnition 3.

Reference-contexts: A shortcoming of IOE is that it is not capable of learning from negative examples, and therefore it cannot be applied in real domains where the concepts are DNF rather than pure conjunctive. MESFA is close to the Hirsh 0 s combination of empirical and analytical learning with IVSM <ref> [3] </ref>. His integrated approach syntactically processes analytically generalized deflnitions of the examples. This and the kinds of learned concept deflnitions suggest that MESFA proposes a more general form of learning. 5 Conclusion A novel approach, called Multiple Explanation-based learning guided by the Space Fragmenting Algorithm (MESFA), was presented.

Reference-contexts: When the language expres-sivenes is insu-cient ( i.e., the deflnition of SC is DNF ), these approaches fail. This situation arises when in the process of incremental learning either of the two anomalies occurs <ref> [4] </ref>; (1) incompleteness: a positive example is encountered, but the current concept deflnitions cannot be generalized to admit it without admitting negative training; (2) inconsistency: a negative example is encountered, but the current concept deflnitions cannot be specialized to reject it without also rejecting positive training. <p> The novelty is that all hypothetical concept deflnitions within the language are considered as a disjunctive version space. The disjunctive version space is representable by its boundary sets and admits incremental learning with the Space Fragmenting algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> Space Fragmenting forms a correct, complete and consistent, pure conjunctive or DNF deflnition of the concept under study. 2 Representation and Ordering of the Concepts The concept deflnitions in MESFA are expressed in a concept description language (CDL DT ) isolated from supplied domain theory DT : Deflnition 1.
