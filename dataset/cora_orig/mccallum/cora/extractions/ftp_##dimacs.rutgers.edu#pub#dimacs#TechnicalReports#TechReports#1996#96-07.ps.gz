Reference-contexts: Some of these results can be extended to geometric graphs to yield the existence of certain non-crossing subgraphs and subgraphs satisfying some other geometric conditions. In [KPT96], we settled a problem of Bialostocki and Dierker <ref> [BD94] </ref> by proving the following theorem. For any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete geometric graph with 3n 1 vertices, there exist n pairwise disjoint edges of the same color.

Reference-contexts: Here we present an O (n log log n+2 )-time algorithm for finding these edges, based on a different proof. The analogous theorem for abstract graphs (that is, when the geometric constraints are ignored) was found by Gerencser and Gyarfas <ref> [GG67] </ref>. It is easy to see that the above results are false for graphs with fewer than 3n 1 vertices.

Reference-contexts: In fact, in this case classical Ramsey-theory works to our advantage by ensuring that either G or G contains a large clique and many other large subgraphs <ref> [GRS90] </ref>. Some of these results can be extended to geometric graphs to yield the existence of certain non-crossing subgraphs and subgraphs satisfying some other geometric conditions. In [KPT96], we settled a problem of Bialostocki and Dierker [BD94] by proving the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: The n segments determined by n points in the plane, no three of which are collinear, form a complete geometric graph with n vertices (see <ref> [PA95] </ref>). Does a given geometric graph contain a non-crossing subgraph of a certain type? It is conjectured that essentially all such problems are NP-hard, regardless of the complexity of their non-geometric analogues. This conjecture is supported by several striking examples.
