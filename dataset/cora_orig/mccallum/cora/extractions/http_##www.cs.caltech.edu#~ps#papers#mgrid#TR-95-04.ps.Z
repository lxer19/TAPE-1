Reference-contexts: But for an SSOR-splitting the multiplication of F 1 AG 1 with a vector can be carried out at the cost of one matrix-vector multiplication and three multiplications of vectors with a scalar <ref> [AB84] </ref>. Usually this is much more efficient than one matrix-vector multiplication plus one inversion of the preconditioner, as required in the non-transforming variant. ILU Preconditioning An incomplete factorization of A can be carried out by using the sparse matrix solver MA28 (see section 8).

Reference-contexts: The classes in question have been given the suffix TR (indicating TRansient). If a mesh is to be refined adaptively, all elements with an error above a certain level are marked by the error estimator. The way of subdivision in 2D is that of PLTMG <ref> [Ban88] </ref> or the bisection strategy of Rivara [Riv84], which does not need irregular `green closures'. In three dimensions, an approach similar to the former one has been chosen: regular (red) subdivision of the marked tetrahedra and a green closure. <p> L is stored row-wise, whereas U is stored column-wise. Thus for symmetrically populated matrices the column vector contains the column indices for the entries of L and the row indices for those of U. This structure is similar to the one used in PLTMG <ref> [Ban88] </ref>. The type MLSparseMatrix maintains lower and upper triangle by linear lists. The class NodeNeighbour contains the column index of the entry and one or two off-diagonal terms (one in the symmetric case).

Reference-contexts: Adaptive Time Step Control The adaptive Rothe-Method is employed for the time-stepping algorithm <ref> [Bor91] </ref>. This approach completely separates time and space discretization: we first discretize (2) with respect to the time variable by choosing a step width t . Then the resulting spatial elliptic subproblem may be solved adaptively like problem (1). <p> The correction n is given by <ref> [Bor91] </ref> (M + t n A) n = 2 n u n1 ) (f (t n ) f (t n1 ))g This formulation preserves the structure of the first-order system (3). The second order correction n yields an estimate of the time error " t n .

Reference-contexts: Cascadic Iterations For positive definite systems and single-level preconditioning this stopping criterion may be quite efficient if the user is merely interested in the energy norm of the solution. The convergence test arises from the lately developed `cascadic iteration' concept <ref> [Bor94, Deu94] </ref>. Instead of monitoring the residual, here the iterative process is stopped if the estimated energy norm of the iteration error u ~u is below a certain limit.

Reference-contexts: Here is the declaration of the additive multigrid preconditioner with symmetric Gauss-Seidel smoothing: class AMGSGS : public AMGPreconditioner - public: virtual void initialize (SystemMatrix* A, Vector&lt;Num&gt;& x, Vector&lt;Num&gt;& b); protected: virtual void smooth (int level, Vector&lt;Num&gt;& e, SystemMatrix& A, Vector&lt;Num&gt;& r); -; The AMLJacobi type is also called BPX-preconditioner <ref> [BPX90] </ref>. If the smoothing pattern is restricted to the new nodes on each level, it is equivalent to the hierarchical basis preconditioner in [DLY89]. 10 THE GRID TRANSFER 30 9.3 Preconditioners for Nonlinear Problems These preconditioners are applied to the nonlinear relaxation-type solvers.

Reference-contexts: A simple, but usually quite satisfying choice is to set to a fixed percentage of the maximum error encountered on the mesh: = 4 T The factor 1 4 is empirical. An attractive alternative is to use extrapolated local errors for the determination of the limit <ref> [BR78] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The most important member functions of the sparse matrix classes carry out the following operations: multiplication with a vector forward and backward Gauss-Seidel and SOR smoothing - LU-decomposition - forward-backward substitution of a decomposed matrix For LU-decomposition and forward-backward substitution we have added the Harwell-MA28 sparse matrix solver <ref> [Duf80] </ref>. A drop tolerance parameter may be set to get 7 THE SPARSE MATRICES 20 in vectors. For a symmetric matrix the upper triangle vector U is identified with L and does not need extra space. L is stored row-wise, whereas U is stored column-wise. <p> Its main members are the system matrix A and the right-hand side vector b. A is always stored as a sparse matrix. The equation system can be solved via LU-Decomposition of A, which is carried out by a sparse matrix routine <ref> [Duf80] </ref>, or by an iterative procedure. The class LinSystem is also used in the context of nonlinear problems. Here the relevant preconditioners supply the updates for nonlinear terms (see section 9). 8.1 The Direct Sparse Matrix Solver We employ the Harwell-MA28 sparse matrix solver [Duf80] for an LU-decomposition. <p> out by a sparse matrix routine <ref> [Duf80] </ref>, or by an iterative procedure.

It is based on a nested dissection approach and thus achieves optimal complexity for a direct solution procedure. It is also possible to generate incomplete LU-factorizations, which may be used as preconditioners for an iterative solver. The incomplete factorization works with a user-specified drop-tolerance.

Reference-contexts: Thus we wanted to be able to handle problems for one, two, or three space dimensions within one single program. Of course, the capabilities of the predecessors, the KASKADE family version 2.0 <ref> [ELR93] </ref>, had to be included as well. The purpose of multilevel techniques is to combine reliability and numerical efficiency. Therefore we implemented besides the routines which carry out adaptive mesh refinement abroad framework for the solution of the arising equation systems.

Reference-contexts: Nonlinear Single-Grid Gauss-Seidel Preconditioning The preconditioner NonLinearSGGS realizes the classical nonlinear Gauss-Seidel iteration. Nonlinear Multilevel Gauss-Seidel Preconditioning Here the coarse grid problems are substituted by linear approximations, which are constructed such that the monotone decrease of the energy functional is guaranteed. Thus the procedure is globally convergent <ref> [Kor93] </ref>. In every iteration the coarse grid problems are set up due to the result of one nonlinear Gauss-Seidel step on the fine grid. It determines the free boundary and the obstacle functions for the coarse-grid corrections.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding variational inequality yields a nonlinear system, which is solved by a single-level Gauss-Seidel or a monotone multigrid method <ref> [Kor95] </ref> (see sections 8 and 9). 4 THE MESH AND ITS COMPONENTS 12 3.3.2 Stefan Problems and Related Nonlinear Equations These problems may be regarded as degenerate parabolic initial value problems of the form @ H (u) rkru = f in u (x; 0) = u 0 (x) in (5) combined <p> Such a nonlinearity can be handled very efficiently in the solution procedure for the equation system. Other nonlinear problems may be formulated in a similar way, e.g. the porous media equation (see <ref> [Kor95] </ref>). Of course, we may have additional obstacle functions like in (4). 4 The Mesh and its Components All our finite element meshes exclusively comprise simplexes, which are derived from the base class PATCH (see figure 4). <p> In an alternative approach we solve the complete extended system in the nodal basis by one nonlinear Gauss-Seidel step including a multigrid V-Cycle (see section 9). Usually this costly procedure does not yield significantly better results <ref> [Kor95] </ref>. 11.2 Residual-Based Error Estimators These estimators directly evaluate the residuals in the interior of the elements and on their boundaries [BM81, ZKGB82].

Reference-contexts: For the code development we used the GNU C++ -compiler (up to version 2.6.3), which is public domain software and one of the best compilers we encountered. We also want to mention the excellent (and witty!) book of Scott Meyers <ref> [Mey92] </ref>, which tells more about the principles of object-oriented programming than many heavy tomes. We close this section with some general remarks on the text: - C++ -language conventions are used for code descriptions. Class names are set in typewriter style.
