Title: Intonational Boundaries, Speech Repairs and Discourse Markers: Modeling Spoken Dialog  
Author: Peter A. Heeman and James F. Allen 
Address: Rochester NY 14627, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Rochester  
Abstract: To understand a speaker's turn of a conversation, one needs to segment it into intonational phrases, clean up any speech repairs that might have occurred, and identify discourse markers. In this paper, we argue that these problems must be resolved together, and that they must be resolved early in the processing stream. We put forward a statistical language model that resolves these problems, does POS tagging, and can be used as the language model of a speech recognizer. We find that by accounting for the interactions between these tasks that the performance on each task improves, as does POS tagging and per plexity.

To allow the decision tree to ask about the words and POS tags in the context, we cluster the words and POS tags using the algorithm of Brown et al. (1992) into a binary classification tree.

Reference-contexts: We introduce null tokens between each pair of consecutive words W i-1 and W i <ref> (Heeman and Allen, 1994) </ref>, which will be tagged as to the occurrence of these events. The boundary tone tag T i indicates if word w i-1 ends an intonational boundary (T i =T), or not (T i =null).

Reference-contexts: The third column adds in silence information. Unlike the case for boundary tones, adding silence does not have much of an effect. 4 The fourth column adds in speech repair correction, and shows that taking into account the correction, gives better detection rates <ref> (Heeman, Loken-Kim, and Allen, 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, speech repairs disrupt the context that is needed to determine the POS tags <ref> (Hindle, 1983) </ref>. Hence, speech repairs, as well as boundary tones and discourse markers, must be resolved during syntactic disambiguation. Of course when dealing with spoken dialogue, one cannot forget the initial problem of determining the actual words that the speaker is saying.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, adding in silence information to help detect the boundary tones and speech repairs results in a further improvement, with the overall POS tagging error rate decreasing by 8.6% and reducing perplexity by 7.8%. In contrast, a word-based trigram backoff model <ref> (Katz, 1987) </ref> built with the CMU statistical language modeling toolkit (Rosenfeld, 1995) achieved a perplexity of 26.13. Thus our full language model results in 14.1% reduction in perplexity. Table 3 gives the results of detecting intonational boundaries.

Reference-contexts: However, for detecting and correcting speech repairs, and identifying boundary tones and discourse markers, we need to augment the model so that it incorporates shallow statistical analysis, in the form of POS tagging. The POS tagset, based on the Penn Treebank tagset <ref> (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993) </ref>, includes special tags for denoting when a word is being used as a discourse marker. In this section, we give an overview of our basic language model that incorporates POS tagging. Full details can be found in (Heeman and Allen, 1997; Heeman, 1997).

Reference-contexts: One of the most critical challenges is simply determining the speaker's intended utterances: both segmenting the speaker's turn into utterances and determining the intended words in each utterance. Since there is no well-agreed to definition of what an utterance is, we instead focus on intonational phrases <ref> (Silverman et al., 1992) </ref>, which end with an acoustically signaled boundary tone. Even assuming perfect word recognition, the problem of determining the intended words is complicated due to the occurrence of speech repairs, which occur where the speaker goes back and changes (or repeats) something she just said.
