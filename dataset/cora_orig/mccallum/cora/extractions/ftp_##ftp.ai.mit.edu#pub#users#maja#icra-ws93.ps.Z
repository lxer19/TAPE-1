Abstract: In addition to its computational and sensory hardware, the architecture of an autonomous robot determines how that robot will behave by imposing key constraints on the way it can sense, reason, and act in order to achieve its task. In this paper we define the basic types of control architectures: purely reactive, behavior-based, and planner-based. We clarify the fundamental differences between the first two approaches, which are commonly confused in the literature. Next we describe the properties of behavior-based systems in detail and compare them to the two alternative approaches. Finally, we describe the application of the behavior-based paradigm in two very different domains.

Reference-contexts: The information in the world model is used by the planner in order to produce the most appropriate sequence of actions, i.e. a plan. At the other extreme lie purely reactive approaches which implement a control strategy as a collection of condition-action pairs (e.g. [Brooks and Con-nell 87], <ref> [Agre and Chapman 87] </ref>, [Connell 90]). The systems consists of a collection of purely reactive rules, containing minimal internal state. These systems maintain no internal models, perform no search, and merely lookup and command the appropriate action for each set of sensor readings.
