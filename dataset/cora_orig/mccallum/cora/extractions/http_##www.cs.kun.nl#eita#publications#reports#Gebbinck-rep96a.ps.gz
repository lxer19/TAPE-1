Abstract: There are many image processing applications where the area of an object has to be estimated as accurately as possible. A well-known example is the area estimation of agricultural fields, which is of great importance for the management of the agricultural subsidy system of the European Union. The area of an object can be estimated using both classification, which allocates a pixel to a single class, and decomposition, which divides a pixel between several classes. Since decomposition is better at handling mixed pixels|pixels comprising multiple classes|which are often found at object boundaries, area estimation by decomposition is expected to be more accurate. To test this hypothesis, a data-driven decomposition method was developed and applied to a series of artificial satellite images of increasing complexity. Data-driven decomposition was able to estimate the percentage of each component of a pixel with an average error of 5%. Narrow structures were processed correctly, and isolated pixels were detected using a simple threshold. A quantitative comparison with the results of three other methods found in the literature showed that the area estimates of data-driven decomposition were significantly more accurate. This study suggests that data-driven decomposition is an accurate area estimation method which is worth further research using real satellite images.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, with the use of a linear mixture model it is possible to estimate the fractions of the ground cover types a mixed pixel is composed of.

The purpose of this study was to develop a data-driven decomposition method and to investigate whether its area estimates are more accurate than the results of an area estimator based on classification.

Reference-contexts: Although there are many variants on this model (Pech et al. [6], Settle and Drake [10], Klein Gebbinck and Schouten [4]), the classical linear mixture model by Horwitz et al. <ref> [2] </ref> is still much used. Following the nomenclature of Settle and Drake, this model is given by x = Mf + e; (1) where vector x denotes the n-dimensional pixel, and vector f represents the proportions of the c objects that take part in the mixed pixel. <p> In theory e is also distributed multivariate normally, having a zero mean and a variance-covariance matrix N depending on the distributions as well as the fractions of the objects. However, it has been argued (Horwitz et al. <ref> [2] </ref>) that N can be approximated by the averaged variance-covariance matrices of the objects without much loss of accuracy, but resulting in a set of equations that is much more tractable.

Reference-contexts: Two approaches that have been suggested in the literature are pixel-based (model-driven) and region-based (data-driven) classification. The first method classifies each pixel individually, whereas the second method first partitions the image into spectrally similar regions and then classifies each region <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. Although the segmentation requires a considerable computational effort, the region-based approach is usually preferred because misclassifications due to the within-crop variation are reduced.

Reference-contexts: Although there are many variants on this model (Pech et al. [6], Settle and Drake [10], Klein Gebbinck and Schouten <ref> [4] </ref>), the classical linear mixture model by Horwitz et al. [2] is still much used. <p> To evaluate the unreliability of each decomposition, a measure was used which was based on the Mahalanobis distance. An exact description of the measure as calculated by the decomposition method can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Similar to the accuracy of the decomposition process, the unreliability of each decomposition was also presented using both a histogram and an image. <p> Due to the many neighbouring regions, the possibilities for spectral confusion were numerous. One suggestion for future work is to investigate the use of a different decomposition method. Instead of the shortcut method which was used for this work, the classical or alternative method could be used|see <ref> [4] </ref>. However, considering the high computational complexity of these methods and the good results already achieved, little gain is to be expected. A more interesting line of research is to use the output of a segmentation program instead of a perfect segmentation.

Reference-contexts: These images were needed because model-driven decomposition could handle no more than five classes at the same time. This number was determined from own experiences but has also been confirmed by Mather <ref> [5] </ref> who stated that the number of Landsat-TM wavebands can be reduced to four without any significant reduction in separability. Since the number of classes model-driven decomposition could handle simultaneously was one more than the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, five classes was the maximum.

Mixed pixels are not only difficult to classify, they also pose a problem for the segmentation algorithm. Fortunately, with the use of a linear mixture model it is possible to estimate the fractions of the ground cover types a mixed pixel is composed of. <p> These techniques do not only find the pure pixel regions, but they also suggest which pixels are mixed and need to be decomposed. For further information on the segmentation of optical satellite images is referred to <ref> [8] </ref> since an in-depth discussion of this subject is considered to be beyond the scope of the present report. Every ground cover class that is to be distinguished must be characterised by a mean vector and a variance-covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: A method which preserves both first- and second-order statistics has been described by Schouten et al. <ref> [9] </ref> and will be briefly summarised in this section. The basis of the artificial image was a binary edge image of high resolution, obtained by scanning and processing a hand-drawn sketch.

If no ancillary information (e.g. cadastral) is available, the regions have to be found through segmentation of the image.
