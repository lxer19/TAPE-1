Abstract: Myrinet is a new type of local-area network (LAN) based on the technology used for packet communication and switching within "massively-parallel processors" (MPPs). Think of Myrinet as an MPP message-passing network that can span campus dimensions, rather than as a wide-area telecommunications network that is operating in close quarters. The technical steps toward making Myrinet a reality included the development of (1) robust, 25m communication channels with flow control, packet framing, and error control; (2) self-initializing, low-latency, cut-through switches; (3) host interfaces that can map the network, select routes, and translate from network addresses to routes, as well as handle packet traffic; and (4) streamlined host software that allows direct communication between user processes and the network. In order to understand how Myrinet differs from conventional LANs such as Ethernet and FDDI, it is helpful to start with Myrinet's genealogy. Myrinet is rooted in the results of two ARPA-sponsored research projects, the Caltech Mosaic, an experimental, fine-grain multicomputer [1], and the USC Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI) ATOMIC LAN [2, 3], which was built using Mosaic components. Myricom, Inc., is a startup company founded by members of these two research projects. Multicomputer Message-Passing Networks. A multicomputer [4, 5] is an MPP architecture consisting of a collection of computing nodes, each with its own memory, connected by a message-passing network. The Caltech Mosaic was an experiment to "push the envelope" of multicomputer design and programming toward a system with up to tens of thousands of small, single-chip nodes rather than hundreds of circuit-board-size nodes. The fine-grain multicomputer places more extreme demands on the message-passing network due to the larger number of nodes and a greater interdependence between the computing processes on different nodes. The message-passing-network technology developed for the Mosaic [6] achieved its goals so well that it was used in several other MPP systems, including the medium-grain Intel Delta and Paragon multicomputers, the Stanford DASH multiprocessor, and the MIT Alewife multiprocessor.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if there is an error on any link on a routing path, the error can be detected at the destination. Myrinet Switches. Myricom is currently shipping 4- and 8-port switches, and developing 16- and 32-port switches. These switches employ exactly the same blocking-cut-through (wormhole) routing <ref> [6] </ref> used in the message-passing networks of such MPP systems as the Intel Paragon and the Cray T3D. The worst-case (path-formation) latency through an 8-port switch is 550ns. The core of the switch is a pipelined crossbar, which introduces no internal conflicts between packet flows.

Reference-contexts: The all-zeros character is the IDLE control symbol, which is discarded by not being detected. The receiver circuits are asynchronous; a character may arrive at any time relative to the clocks in the receiving system, and is later synchronized to those clocks by pipelinesynchronizer circuits <ref> [9] </ref>. Delay variations and crosstalk between cable pairs and delay variations between line drivers and receivers skew the transitions at the receiving end of a channel. The receiver circuits employ a sampling window technique that tolerates skew up to half the 12.5ns character period.
