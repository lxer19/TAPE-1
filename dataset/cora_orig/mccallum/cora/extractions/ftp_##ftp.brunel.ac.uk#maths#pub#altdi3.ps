Title: Note on alternating directed cycles  
Author: Gregory Gutin Benjamin Sudakov Anders Yeo 
Keyword: Alternating cycles, even cycles, edge-coloured directed graphs.  
Abstract: The problem of the existence of an alternating simple dicycle in a 2-arc-coloured digraph is considered. This is a generalization of the alternating cycle problem in 2-edge-coloured graphs (proved to be polynomial time solvable) and the even dicycle problem (the complexity is not known yet). We prove that the alternating dicycle problem is N P-complete. Let f (n) (g(n), resp.) be the minimum integer such that if every monochromatic indegree and outdegree in a strongly connected 2-arc-coloured digraph (any 2-arc-coloured digraph, resp.) D is at least f (n) (g(n), resp.), then D has an alternating simple dicycle. We show that f (n) = fi(log n) and g(n) = fi(log n).

Reference-contexts: Therefore D 1 contains a cycle, which is alternating by the construction of D 1 . 2 Remark. As pointed out to us by N. Alon a similar approach was used in <ref> [1] </ref>. It would be interesting to find better bounds for the functions f (n) and g (n) as well as to investigate these functions for tournaments.

Reference-contexts: A hypergraph is k-uniform if each of its edges has size k. We say that H is 2-colourable if there is a 2-colouring of V such that no edge is monochromatic. The following result was proved by J. Beck <ref> [3] </ref>. Proposition 3.5 There exists an absolute constant c such that any k-uniform hypergraph with at most ck 1=3 2 k edges is 2-colourable. Now we are ready to prove an upper bound for g (n). Theorem 3.6 Let D=(V,A) be a 2-arc-coloured digraph on jV j = n vertices.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction, terminology and notation We shall assume that the reader is familiar with the standard terminology on graphs and digraphs and refer the reader to <ref> [4] </ref>. We consider digraphs without loops and multiple arcs. The arcs of digraphs are coloured with two colours: colour 1 and colour 2. By a cycle in a digraph (in a graph) we mean a directed simple cycle (a simple cycle).

Proof: To show that the ADC problem is N P-hard, we transform the well-known problem 3-SAT ([6], p. 46) to the ADC problem.
