Abstract: We propose a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design builds on a previously designed control architecture that works under normal conditions of operation. The faults that are considered in our design are classified according to capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. Information about these capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the extended control strategies that are needed by these supervisors of each layer of the hierarchy and, in certain cases, give examples of their detailed operation.

Reference-contexts: The framework will partition the task into more manageable parts and formalize the requirements that each of them will need to satisfy. Our framework will be modeled on the control architecture proposed in <ref> [1, 5] </ref> for normal modes of operation. Before presenting the framework we will give a brief overview of this design to fix the terminology and notation. <p> The main idea is that the control problem posed by the AHS is too large to be dealt with by means of a single controller. Therefore a hierarchical control structure is introduced. The design of the control hierarchy outlined in <ref> [1] </ref> centers around the notion of "platooning". It is assumed that traffic on the highway is organized in groups of tightly spaced vehicles, called platoons. <p> Clearly implementation of such a scheme will require automatic control of vehicles, as human drivers are not fast and reliable enough to produce the kinds of inputs necessary for forming platoons. In the architecture outlined in <ref> [1] </ref> the system is organized in five layers. The block diagram of figure 1 shows different layers of the control hierarchy. The top layer, called the network layer, is responsible for the flow of traffic on the entire highway system 2 . <p> Thus, according to this structure, our controller at each level of the hierarchy will consist of a number of control laws and a supervisor to pick the strategy that minimizes the cost function for that level. 3 Fault handling In the control scheme of <ref> [1] </ref>, sensors, actuators and communication equipment will be added to the vehicles and infrastructure for automatic control of vehicles. The additional instrumentation along with the basic mechanical (moving) parts of the vehicle are prone to failure. A comprehensive list of faults, considered in this study, is given in the Appendix. <p> In the next section, we present a way of modeling the capabilities of the controller. This information will then be used in section 3.2 for fault classification. 7 3.1 Quantitative Capability Structure The control scheme for normal operating conditions presented in <ref> [1] </ref> relies on a number of sensors, actuators and communication devices, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. All this additional hardware as well as the standard mechanical parts of the vehicles are prone to failure.

Reference-contexts: The definition of "normal" may vary from case to case, but, in general, it means benign environmental conditions and faultless operation of all the hardware, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. Some studies to deal with "abnormal" conditions have been made (for example <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref>), but they have been in the form of specific faults rather than a general framework. Our goal is to propose an AHS design that will perform well under almost any condition. <p> A possible design for the link layer is described in <ref> [2] </ref>. It is based on a "fluid flow" traffic model similar to the ones developed for manual traffic. The next level of hierarchy below the link layer is the coordination layer. It resides in each vehicle and its task is to coordinate the operation of platoons with their neighbors. <p> They have proven to perform well, mostly under the assumptions that the conditions of operation are "normal" (in the sense discussed above). Some laws also exist for operation under degraded conditions. For example <ref> [2] </ref> contains a link layer control law to divert traffic when a lane is closed (because of an accident for example). [3] describes a regulation layer control law for steering in case of a tire burst. <p> The part of F C dealing with normal operation is shown in figure 6. Similar maps have to be constructed for any strategy introduced to deal with degraded conditions of operation. 3.1.5 Link Layer Supervisor Predicates The link layer design of <ref> [2] </ref> makes use of information about the density and average velocity of traffic in a link to come up with control inputs (in the form of suggested paths, platoon sizes etc), that will maximize the throughput of the highway. <p> The velocity law includes a relaxation term to capture dynamics of tracking the desired aggregate velocity and an anticipation term, to model headway keeping of vehicles. For implementation purposes the link is spatially discretized into 1km long sections. Details of this strategy can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. Given a fluid flow model as the basis for control of the link layer, in the normal mode, the link layer control strategy is to balance density and regulate velocity, while also ensuring that all vehicles make their exits.

Reference-contexts: The current design <ref> [6] </ref> uses protocols, in the form of finite state machines, to organize the maneuvers in a systematic way. They receive the commands of the link layer and aggregated sensor information from the individual vehicles (of the form "there is a vehicle in the adjacent lane"). <p> The design of the supervisor induces a mapping between the capability vectors of the regulation layer and its supervisor.

Being an emergency maneuver, it can abort some of the normal mode maneuvers. Forced split is typically 23 used by a faulty vehicle to become a free agent. A follower can request the leader of the platoon to initiate a forced split . <p> For this case, we will need an additional platoon lane change 24 lateral controller in the regulation layer. Front Dock: This maneuver is initiated by a platoon leader that wants to join the vehicle in front but, because of a fault, it can not execute the join maneuver of <ref> [6] </ref> (which requires accelerating to close the gap and then decelerating to match the speed). The initiating vehicle requests the leader of the preceding platoon for a front dock .

Reference-contexts: The law proposed in <ref> [7] </ref> for the followers in a platoon, on the other hand, makes use of additional information about the state of the leader of the platoon. It is assumed that this information will be transmitted to all the followers using an infrared communication link.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the applicability of a regulation layer controller can be modeled by a predicate whose value depends on the values of the predicates for the physical layer. Consider, for example, the Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Controller proposed in <ref> [10] </ref> as the default law for the leader of a platoon. This longitudinal control law uses sensor readings 8 of velocity and acceleration of the vehicle, as well as readings of the spacing and relative velocity of the preceding vehicle to calculate values for the throttle and and brake inputs. <p> a mapping from the vector coding the capabilities of the physical layer to the vector coding the capabilities of the regulation layer: F R : f0; 1g n s +n a +n c ! f0; 1g n long +n lat figure 4 shows this mapping for the control designs in <ref> [8, 9, 10, 12] </ref> 9 3.1.3 Regulation Layer Supervisor Capability Predicates From the point of view of the coordination layer, the regulation layer control laws represent resources that can be used to carry out maneuvers (such as merging and splitting platoons and changing lanes). <p> The design of the supervisor induces a mapping between the capability vectors of the regulation layer and its supervisor.
