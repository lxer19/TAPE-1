Abstract: Homology-based modeling, or more simply homology modeling, is becoming increasingly important. Models accurate to within 1-2 RMS deviation from the actual three-dimensional structure can be produced by homology modeling in favorable cases. With the number of known three-dimensional structures projected to grow to more than ten thousand structures by the end of the decade, it will be possible to model a significant fraction of all sequences using these approaches. In homology modeling, a known three-dimensional structure is used as a template from which a three-dimensional model of a novel sequence is calculated. In the first stages of this procedure, the critical steps are the location of an appropriate homologous structure to use as the template, and the correct mapping of the novel sequence onto the known structure. The detection of a homologous structure involves the inference that the structure is indeed homologous based on a sequence or structure-based comparison. This inference is based on the assumption that if the sequence and structure are, by some measure, significantly similar, they are homologous. Unfortunately, for many extant methods, the influence of various parameters on the significance of the similarity is not well understood. In particular, the influence of variables such as the scoring system, and penalties for insertions and deletions in dynamic programming based approaches are still not theoretically understood and can be determined only by empirical approaches. This work examines the effects of scoring system and affine gap penalties on the ability of a localsimilarity dynamic programming algorithm to discriminate between homologous and unrelated sequences.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The prediction of the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on the known structure of homologous proteins is becoming increasingly successful, often producing modeled structures accurate to within 1-2 RMS deviation from the actual three-dimensional structure (for a recent comprehensive review see <ref> [1] </ref>). The continuing exponential growth of both sequence and structural databases makes it increasingly likely that a homologous protein with known three-dimensional structure can be found for a novel sequence.

Reference-contexts: Similar or identical algorithms are often used for steps 1 and 2. When the matching is based on sequences, the method of choice is usually a localsimilarity dynamic programming approach (Smith-Waterman algorithm) <ref> [2] </ref>, or a fast approximation to it [3,4]. More recently, approaches that attempt to match the target and template based on the local structural environment of the template structure [5] or an empirical energy function [6,7,8] have been developed. <p> Methods 2.1. MPSRCH Sequence comparisons were performed using a local similarity dynamic programming algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, as implemented in the MPSRCH program (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View CA). Results were normalized for systematic dependence on sequence length using the ranking function method implemented in this package.

Reference-contexts: MPSRCH was used in the affine gap scoring mode in which a length dependent (gap initiation) and a length dependent (gap extension) penalty are used. Query sequences were compared to the Swiss-Prot database release 28.0 <ref> [9] </ref> which contains 1.25x10 7 residues in 36,000 sequences. 2.2. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) The receiver operating characteristic is widely used in clinical fields to evaluate both treatments and the predictive success of clinical tests (for a review see [10]). It is the latter use that concerns us here.

An example of a clinical use of ROC analysis might be to evaluate the success of a test, for instance serum cholesterol level, in predicting the future presence of a disease condition, for instance heart attack.

Reference-contexts: It may be contrasted with other approaches such as simply counting the number of true positives in a fixed number of the top scores from a database search <ref> [11] </ref> which measures the sensitivity of the search but doesnt measure the specificity, or examination of the fractions of true positive and true negatives above a specified threshold [12,13] which measures both sensitivity and specificity, but is very sensitive to the threshold.

Reference-contexts: The ROC 50 value is thus the probability that a homologous sequence will have a comparison score higher than one of the highest scoring false positives. 2.3. Definition of Positives Initial groups of positive sequences were defined based on the entries in the PROSITE database <ref> [14] </ref>. A group of five to ten sequences were picked from this initial group that, based on the sequence annotation, did not appear to be closely related.

Reference-contexts: For each family, four to six sequences representative of the range of sequences in the entire family were selected as queries based on initial database searches. The ROC 50 was then determined for each query sequence using four different PAM scoring tables <ref> [15] </ref> and a range of both gap initiation and gap extension values. These results therefore represent a condensation of approximately 5400 complete searches of the protein sequence database. 3.1. 4Fe-4S Ferredoxins The 4Fe-4S ferredoxins are small proteins involved in electron transfer [16].

Ferredoxin like molecules also function in photosynthesis, and are found as independent domains in a variety of enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions. These ferredoxins bind a 4Fe-4S cluster at a highly conserved 26 residue sequence.

Reference-contexts: The plot (Fig 1f) for the gap extension penalty is again nearly flat suggesting the relative irrelevance of this parameter. 3.3. Bacterial Sigma Factors Bacterial sigma factors are a widespread group of proteins with a distinctive pattern of conserved and variable regions (for a recent review see <ref> [19] </ref>). The proteins vary greatly in length, from approximately 280 residues to more than 600. This variation in length is both due to variation in the length of the variable regions and to the lack of some of the conserved regions in the smaller proteins.
