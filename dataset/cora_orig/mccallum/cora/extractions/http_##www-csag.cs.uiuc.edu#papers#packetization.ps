Reference-contexts: A number of commercial systems incorporate some form of packetization [13, 4, 8]. Fig. 1. Network latency versus load and message length. The load rate is normalized to the network's wire capacity. There have been many studies evaluating the performance of wormhole-routed networks <ref> [6, 1, 11] </ref>. Both Mailhot [11] and Agarwal [1] found that network performance degrades as message length increases; closer examination shows that the performance decrease is caused by increased channel coupling due to longer messages. The results in Figure 1 illustrate this phenomenon. <p> Fig. 1. Network latency versus load and message length. The load rate is normalized to the network's wire capacity.

Reference-contexts: Within these networks, we examine impacts of packetiza-tion on two types of routers. First, we examine packetization in dimension-order routers, similar to those in most existing multicomputer networks. Second, we extend our study to next-generation networks which are likely to incorporate advanced routing techniques such as adaptive routing <ref> [12, 2] </ref> and virtual lanes 3 Chittor and Enbody studied the Symult 2010 system [13] in which long messages are split into packets of 256 bytes. [7] . The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. <p> In the following sections, we investigate the impact of packetization on the performance of advanced routing networks. 4 Packetization and Multipath Networks Several routing techniques that eliminate the intermessage interference in wormhole-routed networks have been proposed. For example, multipath routing techniques such as adaptive routing <ref> [12, 2] </ref> and virtual lanes [7] reduce intermessage interference by circumnavigating congestion and multiplexing resources respectively. In this section, we investigate the impact of packetization on the advanced routing networks which incorporate both adaptive routing and virtual lanes. <p> In such networks, much of the intermessage interference is eliminated, so packeti-zation may not enhance network performance as much as in the dimension-order router. For our studies, we use a planar-adaptive router <ref> [2] </ref>, a minimal adaptive router. Its details are not important as for the two-dimensional networks considered, the planar-adaptive router is a fully adaptive, minimal router. The acronyms, DOR, PAR and VL are used for the dimension-order router, the planar-adaptive router and virtual lanes, respectively in the figures.

Reference-contexts: We consider hardware support to be a requirement because performing packetization and reassembly in software not only degrades processor performance, it also increases communication latency. For example, Chittor and Enbody's studies showed packetization overheads (24.6 sec) for each packet, much larger than the typical routing delays (14.8 sec) <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Second, packetization increases the network load; each packet must contain routing and sequencing information in its header. For smaller packet sizes, the overhead increases proportionally.

Reference-contexts: Packetization, breaking large messages into sets of smaller messages for transmission, has been suggested as a technique for improving the performance of wormhole routed networks. A number of commercial systems incorporate some form of packetization <ref> [13, 4, 8] </ref>. Fig. 1. Network latency versus load and message length. The load rate is normalized to the network's wire capacity. There have been many studies evaluating the performance of wormhole-routed networks [6, 1, 11]. <p> The routers modeled are quite similar to those in the Intel Paragon <ref> [4] </ref> and the Symult 2010 [13]. In the nonpacketizing network, the messages are transmitted in the traditional fashion. In the packetizing network, each message is broken into packets of 16, 32, or 64 flits and queued in the network input queue.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the simulation models and metrics used for the exploration.

In this paper, we examine in depth the question, is packetization desirable in wormhole-routed networks? For the remainder of the paper, we consider only k-ary n-cube networks.

Reference-contexts: Another potential advantage of packetization is an improvement in the distribution of short message latencies. Our simulations show that under bimodal traffic loads (short and long messages), long messages not only increase the average latency of short messages, but also disperse the latency distribution significantly <ref> [10] </ref>. This dependence is shown in Fig. 2. The dispersion is reflected in increased variance of short message latencies. <p> Adaptive routing allows short messages to get around blockage by selecting alternate paths. Since virtual lanes and adaptive routing both improve short message performance in very different ways, they complement each other to improve the short message latency distribution <ref> [10] </ref>. Fig. 7 shows that adaptive routing and virtual lanes can eliminate the effects of long messages on short messages almost completely. The distribution of short message latencies is improved dramatically. Comparing the advanced (a) (b) Fig. 7.
