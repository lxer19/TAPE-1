Reference-contexts: Crash types provide a way to identify the highway safety problem. A suitable set of crashes is suggested by the target crash problem classification in <ref> [6] </ref>: (i) Rear-end, (ii) Single vehicle road departure (SVRD), (iii) Intersection crossing path (ICP), (iv) Lane change/merge (LCM), (v) Backing, (vi) Opposite direction (OD), and (vii) Other, which includes crashes induced by obstacles and vehicle failures. <p> According to the 1994 GES crash database, the first three crash types account for the majority (approx. 75%) of police reported crashes in the U.S. <ref> [6] </ref>. The methods described in this paper are applicable to the rear-end and lane change induced rear-end crashes. We illustrate the methodology using highway driving environment, although it is applicable to more general scenarios.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the controllers of all vehicles can be designed so as not to execute unsafe lane changes and engage in coordinated braking, such as in case of platooning <ref> [7, 3] </ref>. We illustrate some of these ideas by analyzing effect of different automation systems in mitigating rear-end and LCM crashes. <p> Feedback control laws can then be used to generate throttle and brake commands to track the desired acceleration trajectory. Such feedback control laws have been successfully designed and tested experimentally <ref> [7] </ref>. Note that a vehicle can respond to downstream traffic disturbances either by braking or lane changing. Out of these choices, lane changing depends on the traffic in the adjacent lanes. <p> The use of spatial preview has been highly successful in (i) designing lateral controllers for lane keeping [20] where steering commands are generated based on information about the curvature of the upcoming road, and (ii) designing longitudinal controllers for platooning <ref> [7, 18] </ref> where the acceleration of the lead vehicle is communicated to all followers to execute coordinated maneuvers. It is clear that preview information has the potential to improve the tradeoff between safety and comfort in other longitudinal control and warning system applications.

Reference-contexts: We model the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle by a second order system with a pure time delay ffi d and lag ffi l representing lumped sensing, actuation, processing delays, and driver reaction time. Experimental testing of the brake actuation systems developed at PATH <ref> [8] </ref> show that the step response of the brake actuator is adequately modeled by a dead time in series with a first order lag.

Reference-contexts: Characterization of safe vehicle following Assuming that vehicle 1 (i) does not go backwards, (ii) does not collide with the vehicle ahead, and (iii) has a bounded value for acceleration given by a min 1 , it can be shown that <ref> [9] </ref>: 4 * the worst disturbance generated by vehicle 1 is to brake as hard as it can (a 1 = a min 1 ), until it comes to a stop, and * the optimal control that vehicle 2 can apply is to brake hard. <p> Note: Similar analysis has been used in [15] and the CalSpan PSA studies for vehicle following under type 1 disturbances. Our method (originally proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>) provides a formal approach that can be used for parameter sensitivity analysis as in [13], or to include more severe disturbances such as type 2 disturbances including collision [9, 16], or type 3 and 4 disturbances as in [17]. <p> Our method (originally proposed in [9]) provides a formal approach that can be used for parameter sensitivity analysis as in [13], or to include more severe disturbances such as type 2 disturbances including collision <ref> [9, 16] </ref>, or type 3 and 4 disturbances as in [17]. Naturally with disturbances of types 2, 3 and 4, we can no longer demand that vehicle 2 will be safe under all possible disturbances. The analysis can still be applied by appropriately restricting the disturbance values in each set. <p> Naturally with disturbances of types 2, 3 and 4, we can no longer demand that vehicle 2 will be safe under all possible disturbances. The analysis can still be applied by appropriately restricting the disturbance values in each set. Refer to <ref> [9, 16, 13, 17] </ref> for details. <p> Safety could be achieved by ensuring that the initial condition begins inside the safe set and the vehicle applies maximum braking on the boundary of the safe set. In the interior of the safe set, the controller can be optimized for comfort and efficiency. Refer to <ref> [9] </ref> for an example of such a multi-objective controller design. It can be shown that controllers so designed will be string stable, i.e., in a string of vehicles following such a control law, spacings errors will not amplify.

Reference-contexts: Note that the disturbance parameter (a min 1 ) should be chosen to set the conservativeness of the design. The result is obtained by formulating the vehicle following problem as a two player-zero sum dynamic game <ref> [10] </ref> and solving for its saddle solution. The solution of the game provides a characterization of the worst disturbance and the optimal control. Even though solution to this particular game is intuitively obvious, this formulation of the vehicle following problem has provided us with some interesting insights.

Reference-contexts: For such a situation (i.e., reduce severity as against avoid collisions completely), we can show that for certain parameter combinations, it is optimal for vehicle 2 to accelerate and hit vehicle 1 before the relative velocity builds up <ref> [11] </ref>, instead of braking. This result can be used to induce a partition in the (v; r; _r) space of vehicle 2 separating the safe states from the unsafe ones, where the set of safe states is defined as follows.

Reference-contexts: Vehicle 2 is assumed to maintain constant speed during the pure time delay ffi d .

Refer to <ref> [9, 16, 13, 17] </ref> for details. <p> Vehicle 2 knows its own acceleration capability in addition to v; r; _r: In this case, vehicle 2 can substitute the actual capability instead of the end points of the capability distribution in calculating hard braking safety separation. In <ref> [13] </ref>, a braking capability distribution for pas senger cars on highways was created by using new car braking capability data from Consumer Report tests along with North American production figures during a calendar year. The distribution is shown in Figure 3. <p> of itself as well as vehicle 1 in addition to v; r; _r (vehicle 1 can communicate the estimate of its own braking capability): In this case, actual braking capabilities for both vehicles can be substituted instead of the end points of the distribution in calculating hard braking safety separation <ref> [13] </ref>. Again, assuming that both vehicles can estimate their own braking capability within 0:05g, the average spacing drops to 7m. 6. <p> It can be seen that as the information available for control increases, average safe inter-vehicle spacing reduces, resulting in higher capacities for the highway with the same level of safety. Some of these information structures are analyzed in <ref> [13] </ref> to identify different AHS concepts and quantify the safety and capacity of each information structure. In case of an AHS, where every vehicle is automatically controlled, the inter-vehicle spacing numbers directly translate to the AHS lane capacity. <p> The methodology was applied to designing safe sets for vehicle following. The design tools and methods have been successfully used for design and evaluation of Automated Highway System (AHS) concepts <ref> [13] </ref>. Interesting safety-comfort tradeoffs were identified in this paper for longitudinal vehicle following based on different information structures.

For a comprehensive discussion of string stability of different vehicle following concepts, the reader is referred to <ref> [18] </ref>. If a partially or completely automated vehicle 2 is operating with the manually driven vehicles, it can experience an unsafe cut-in by vehicle 3. <p> The use of spatial preview has been highly successful in (i) designing lateral controllers for lane keeping [20] where steering commands are generated based on information about the curvature of the upcoming road, and (ii) designing longitudinal controllers for platooning <ref> [7, 18] </ref> where the acceleration of the lead vehicle is communicated to all followers to execute coordinated maneuvers. It is clear that preview information has the potential to improve the tradeoff between safety and comfort in other longitudinal control and warning system applications.
