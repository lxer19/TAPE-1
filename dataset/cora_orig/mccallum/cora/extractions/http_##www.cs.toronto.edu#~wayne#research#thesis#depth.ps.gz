Reference-contexts: The question of what kind of integrator to use to integrate N -body systems is one that has had plenty of attention. No discussion of stellar system N -body integrators would be complete without mention of Aarseth's classic integration scheme for collisional systems <ref> [1] </ref>, which includes regularization. Makino [55] derived formulae for optimal order and timestep criteria for Aarseth-type integrators. For collisionless N - body systems, and indeed many non-astronomical Hamiltonian systems, symplectic integrators have enjoyed widespread popularity. Recent years have also seen a growing interest in exactly conserving integrators. <p> We are interested in the case that a and b are finite integers. For a discrete map, f may be a simple equation, such as the logistic equation f (x) = 1 2x 2 , which maps the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref> onto itself. For an ODE system like the N -body problem, f (x) represents the one-timestep flow through x. <p> Next we offer a taste of the proof of an almost "trivial" theorem: if a 1D map is contracting, then noisy orbits are shadowed. First we prove a lemma. LEMMA [1D Fixed Point Lemma]: Let f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] be a continuous map. Then there exists a fixed point x fl 2 [0; 1] of f , i.e., f (x fl ) = x fl . PROOF [44]: If f (0) = 0 or f (1) = 1 we are done. <p> Next we offer a taste of the proof of an almost "trivial" theorem: if a 1D map is contracting, then noisy orbits are shadowed. First we prove a lemma. LEMMA [1D Fixed Point Lemma]: Let f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] be a continuous map. Then there exists a fixed point x fl 2 [0; 1] of f , i.e., f (x fl ) = x fl . PROOF [44]: If f (0) = 0 or f (1) = 1 we are done. <p> First we prove a lemma. LEMMA [1D Fixed Point Lemma]: Let f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] be a continuous map. Then there exists a fixed point x fl 2 [0; 1] of f , i.e., f (x fl ) = x fl . PROOF [44]: If f (0) = 0 or f (1) = 1 we are done. Thus, assume 0 &lt; f (0) and f (1) &lt; 1. Consider g (x) = x f (x). <p> Consider g (x) = x f (x). Clearly g (0) = 0 f (0) &lt; 0 and g (1) = 1 f (1) &gt; 0. Since g (x) is continuous, it must cross 0 as x increases from 0 to 1. Hence, there is some x fl in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for which g (x fl ) = 0 = x fl f (x fl ), so f (x fl ) = x fl : 2 A slightly more complex argument is required to prove the existence of a fixed point for an arbitrary interval X. <p> For our purposes we will assume the above lemma holds for an arbitrary closed finite interval, not just <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. THEOREM [1D Contracting Map Shadowing Theorem]: Let X be a continuous 1-dimensional interval and let f : X ! X be a continuous, uniformly contracting scalar map 3 , i.e., 8 x; x+ffi 2 X; jf (x+ffi)f (x)j aejffij; ae &lt; 1. <p> Thus we want f to be as expansive as possible when iterated forward, i.e., we want f 01 to be as small as possible, to facilitate shadowing.) Let fy n g N+1 n=0 be a pseudo-orbit of a C 2 continuous map f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1]. They define the "expansiveness" as oe = sup N X jf 01 n+1 f 01 Each f 01 i measures how contractive the map is when applied backwards at step i, so that smaller is "better". <p> Thus we want f to be as expansive as possible when iterated forward, i.e., we want f 01 to be as small as possible, to facilitate shadowing.) Let fy n g N+1 n=0 be a pseudo-orbit of a C 2 continuous map f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1]. They define the "expansiveness" as oe = sup N X jf 01 n+1 f 01 Each f 01 i measures how contractive the map is when applied backwards at step i, so that smaller is "better". <p> The description is similar to that of oe. For example, the n = 0 term measures by how much all the 1-step errors are contracted when they are propagated backwards to step 0. THEOREM [14]: Let f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] be a C 2 function with M = supfjf 00 (x)j : 0 x 1g: Let y = fy n g N+1 n=0 be a pseudo-orbit of f such that 2M oeo 1: Then there is an exact orbit x = fx n g N n=0 <p> The description is similar to that of oe. For example, the n = 0 term measures by how much all the 1-step errors are contracted when they are propagated backwards to step 0. THEOREM [14]: Let f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] be a C 2 function with M = supfjf 00 (x)j : 0 x 1g: Let y = fy n g N+1 n=0 be a pseudo-orbit of f such that 2M oeo 1: Then there is an exact orbit x = fx n g N n=0 with o 2 <p> Multiple star systems form an integral part of the evolution of globular clusters, and thus cannot be ignored. Without special treatment the integration of tight binary star systems can soak up the majority of your CPU time and slow the simulation immensely <ref> [1] </ref>. Regularization is the process of speeding up the simulation of these orbits by solving them analytically as perturbed two-body systems. Here are some more terms that are not to do with stellar dynamics, but astronomy in general.

Reference-contexts: Second, backward error analysis should never be offered as more than a partial justification: it is still necessary to show, for example, that errors in the force field do not seriously effect the quantities of interest. A very interesting, but overly pessimistic, paper is one by Adams et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. They note that a numerical solution to an ODE always remains close to a true solution of the problem for some length of time. The interesting quantity is the typical length scale of each of these sections of the numerical solution. <p> Finally, there may be the possibility of proving rigorously that a shadow does not exist. The literature on this subject seems rather sparse; it is mentioned briefly in Adams et al. <ref> [2] </ref> and Iserles et al. [42]. Glossary Like most groups of technical people, stellar dynamicists have a language all their own. This glossary is informal, and constitutes an exceedingly brief and fleeting crash course in stellar dynamics for those members of my committee not familiar with the terms.

Reference-contexts: Shadowing was first discussed by Anosov <ref> [3] </ref> and Bowen [10], in relation to hyperbolic systems. In a 2-dimensional hyperbolic system, there are two special directions called the unstable (or expanding) and the stable (or contracting) directions, which may vary with time and generally are not orthogonal.

Reference-contexts: shadowing is identical to the concept of dichotomy in BVPs [60, 16]: Definition: For positive constants K; , the system @ t (t; o ) = f z (z (t); t)(t; o ); (o; o ) = I is said to be (K; )-hyperbolic [16] or to have exponential dichotomy <ref> [5, p.116] </ref> on the interval [a; b] if for a given s 2 [a; b] there exist linear subspaces S (s) and U (s) such that, if y 0 2 S (s), j (t; a) 1 (s; a)y 0 j Ke (ts) jy 0 j j (t; a) 1 (s; a)y <p> It is related to Green's functions, in the sense that if there are bounds, exponential in time, on the Green's functions, then there is a dichotomy <ref> [5, section 3.4.3] </ref>. The splitting of the solution components into the stable and unstable subspaces is called decoupling in the BVP literature, and standard algorithms exist to handle decoupling. <p> Many topics of potential interest to the study of shadowing, including multiple shooting, are discussed in Ascher et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. Enright [24] suggests ways to improve the performance of multiple shooting, based on clever ways of choosing the sub-interval endpoints.

Reference-contexts: Thus, no true solution exists that remains close to the noisy solution for both t 0 and t 0. 5.3 Shadowing non-hyperbolic systems For non-hyperbolic systems, we may have to be satisfied with finite-length shadows. The first studies of shadows for non-hyperbolic systems appear to be Beyn <ref> [8] </ref> and Hammel et al. [31]. Grebogi, Hammel, Yorke, and Sauer [32, 28] provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of a shadow for a non-hyperbolic system over a non-trivial length of time.

For example, methods for a posteriori, rigorous error bounds on 2PBVPs existed in 1981 [50], six years before GHYS.

The fact that they could shadow the Lorenz equations 10 4 times longer using a rescaling of time is remarkable.

Reference-contexts: Although their results with the Lorenz attractor are interesting and worthy of further study, their conclusions are misguided. Corless <ref> [19] </ref> argues that perhaps too much emphasis is put on exponential magnification of numerical errors. <p> Corless [19] argues that perhaps too much emphasis is put on exponential magnification of numerical errors. He bases this conclusion on the observation that even real systems have perturbations that, for practical and even fundamental purposes, we necessarily ignore <ref> [19, p.32] </ref>: Mathematical modelling of real phenomena always requires approximation and neglect of small effects. One neglects, for example, the effect of the gravitational attraction of Jupiter on one's earthbound experiment. . . . <p> The measures of error for shadowing are the distance between the numerical trajectory and the shadow, and the length of time the two remain near to each other. This is different from more common forms of backward error analysis for ODEs (see, eg., <ref> [19] </ref>) and also the argument used in favour of symplectic integrators, in which it is shown that the numerical solution lies along the exact solution of an ODE system whose governing equation has been slightly perturbed.

Reference-contexts: This means that the shadowing distance is about 10 5 times the size of the 1-step errors, giving a shadow distance of about 10 10:5 . This "magnification factor", the ratio between shadow distance and local error, is termed the "brittleness" of an orbit by Dawson et al. <ref> [20] </ref>. They show that if the number of positive and negative Lyapunov exponents changes, or if a particular one fluctuates about zero, then this magnification factor can blow up.

Reference-contexts: Discreteness noise can also introduce spurious heating of a collisionless cold disk, so that artificial disk-cooling mechanisms must be introduced [68, 57]. Dyer and Ip <ref> [22] </ref> note that equation (2) is physically inconsistent: particles act like Plummer distributions when they are contributing to the field, but are points when the field acts upon them, leading to a violation of Newton's Third Law and thus a violation of conservation of momentum.

Reference-contexts: Many topics of potential interest to the study of shadowing, including multiple shooting, are discussed in Ascher et al. [5]. Enright <ref> [24] </ref> suggests ways to improve the performance of multiple shooting, based on clever ways of choosing the sub-interval endpoints.

Reference-contexts: However, since energy is not the only quantity conserved in most systems, there is still the possibility of building a symplectic integrator that conserves other quantities, although there are limits to what the integrator can conserve in comparison to the real system <ref> [25] </ref>. Furthermore, if the system is not Hamiltonian, then a symplectic integrator provides no added benefit, whereas a conserving integrator may still be of great value. One must be careful, however, how one enforces energy conservation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, although the "orbit" may be reproduced correctly by the numerical solution, the time at which the real particle and simulated particle pass a certain point may differ. This is the case even if the integrator is symplectic <ref> [76, 26] </ref>. Thus, when attempting to shadow a numerical solution, it may be necessary to "rescale" time [16, 17, 18, 80].

Reference-contexts: The e-folding time t e of the exponential divergence seems to be of order the crossing time, t cr , although it increases (i.e., the rate of exponential divergence decreases) as the system becomes less collisional.

In contrast, Goodman, Heggie, and Hut <ref> [27] </ref> argue that the exponential divergence is solely a result of encounters, and is greatest in particles that undergo the strongest encounters. They postulate that a completely smooth gravitational potential would display no exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, i.e., t e = 1. <p> Heggie [37] studied many aspects of chaos in stellar N -body systems. He provides yet another derivation of t e Kt cr , similar to Goodman et al. <ref> [27] </ref>, and uses numerical experiments to estimate K 1 6 for large N .

Bi-shadowing studies not only the existence of a true solution close to a numerical solution, but the existence of possible numerical solutions close to arbitrary true solutions. Many authors have demonstrated that the rate of exponential divergence decreases as a system becomes less collisional <ref> [47, 48, 49, 27, 63] </ref>. Hayes [33] demonstrates that a simple scaling of the N -body problem gives a shadow length inversely proportional to N , which seems rather disappointing.

Reference-contexts: The total force on particle i is the sum of the forces exerted on it by all the other particles. We study the reliability of direct numerical simulation of the large N gravitational N -body problem. A partial list of errors introduced in such simulations includes <ref> [33] </ref>: finite-N sampling, or discreteness noise, because the N used in simulations usually is much smaller than the N of the system being modelled; force softening, which eliminates the singularity at r = 0 and lessens spurious collisional effects introduced by finite-N sampling [9]; using fast but approximate force algorithms such <p> The interesting quantity is the typical length scale of each of these sections of the numerical solution.

They argue that diversions may be detectable if some first integral is violated at that point; however, as was shown in the errata to Hayes <ref> [33] </ref>, glitches in N -body solutions, for example, do not appear to be detectable via violations of energy conservation alone. One very interesting observation made by Adams et al. concerns integration of the Lorenz equations using a "classical Runge-Kutta method" (they do not specify exactly which one). <p> If we let D be the dimension of the problem, then the resolvent has O (D 2 ) terms in it, and it takes O (D 3 ) time to compute.

First, from the more rigourous study of simpler systems, glitches are known to exist and are not just a failure of any particular refinement algorithm. Second, QT's results are consistent with a conjecture by GHYS on the frequency of glitches. However, Hayes <ref> [33] </ref> frequently saw cases in which the algorithm failed to find a shadow for noisy orbits of length S, but succeeded in finding a shadow for the superset of length 2S. Hence, the algorithm failed to find a shadow of length S, even though one exists.

Finally, there may be the possibility of proving rigorously that a shadow does not exist.

For collisional systems this may mean that timescales and statistics are distorted by some approximately computable amount <ref> [38] </ref>, but for collisionless systems this spurious collisionality is simply a source of error [39]. The effect of close encounters can be moderated via force softening, but the granular effect of the gravitational potential is strong even for particles that are separated by large distances ([75, section 1.3a], [68]). <p> Thus, there is little use in attempting to measure statistics any more accurately than this limit dictates <ref> [74, 73, 35, 38] </ref>. <p> However, Lecar [53] chose to measure different statistics, and found them to vary widely depending on which machine or algorithm was used to integrate the problem. This will be further discussed below. 2.2.1 Efficiency of many small vs. one large simulation Smith [73] and Heggie <ref> [38] </ref> have noted that n simulations each with N=n particles is much less expensive than 1 simulation with N particles, and is also completely trivial to parallelize. <p> Unfortunately, this scaling is non-trivial because different processes scale differently with N , so it is possible that they interact differently in current simulations than they do in real clusters <ref> [38] </ref>. <p> Although this method is less effective at modelling some processes that really do need a large N , such as gravothermal effects, it may be reliable enough to study processes such as core collapse rates, escape rates, binary star formation rates, density profiles, and gradients of velocity dispersion with radius <ref> [38] </ref>. However, this does not mean that we can learn everything there is to learn about these statistics by running millions of simulations with N = 64, because discreteness noise is still a factor. <p> For example, theoretically predicted phenomena in globular clusters such as mass segregation, core collapse, binary star formation rates, and relaxation times all seem to be reproduced reasonably faithfully by good N -body simulations <ref> [38] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Chow and Van Vleck [16] show explicitly how shadowing is related to multiple shooting. The field of 2PBVPs is comparatively mature in comparison to the study of shadowing. For example, methods for a posteriori, rigorous error bounds on 2PBVPs existed in 1981 <ref> [50] </ref>, six years before GHYS. Clearly, the study of shadowing may benefit from interaction with the study of 2PBVPs. 22 7 Discussion and future directions In this author's opinion, the most exciting recent prospect is the application of rescaling of time discussed above, particularly by Coomes et al. [18].

Reference-contexts: Many topics of potential interest to the study of shadowing, including multiple shooting, are discussed in Ascher et al. [5]. Enright [24] suggests ways to improve the performance of multiple shooting, based on clever ways of choosing the sub-interval endpoints. Krogh, Keener, and Enright <ref> [51] </ref> show how it is possible to reduce the size of the resolvent matrix since there are really only k unknowns at one end and N k at the other, instead of integrating the entire variational equation.

Reference-contexts: They discuss several other examples of unpredictable behaviour of a numerical solution in comparison with the solution produced by enclosure methods. Based on these results, they question whether true solutions of the Lorenz equations, or even of celestial mechanical systems that are generally believed to be chaotic <ref> [81, 78, 52] </ref>, are in fact chaotic. They further use this result to claim that shadowing results for ODEs are practically useless since, they (erroneously) claim, there is no iron-clad guarantee of a bound on local error.

Reference-contexts: He concluded that the statistics taken are reliable unless energy conservation is grossly violated. However, Lecar <ref> [53] </ref> chose to measure different statistics, and found them to vary widely depending on which machine or algorithm was used to integrate the problem. <p> Thus they were able to measure divergences larger than could be represented by the floating point system.)

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to see if a 4th order version of their method would also give comparable results to Hut et al. [40]. The error of this method is analyzed more fully in Littell, Skeel, and Zhang <ref> [54] </ref>, where they come to the unsurprising conclusion that the smallest stepsize times the highest frequency of the "quickly" changing components must be small. In other words, their method still needs an adequate sample of the highest frequency changes in order to integrate them.

Reference-contexts: The question of what kind of integrator to use to integrate N -body systems is one that has had plenty of attention. No discussion of stellar system N -body integrators would be complete without mention of Aarseth's classic integration scheme for collisional systems [1], which includes regularization. Makino <ref> [55] </ref> derived formulae for optimal order and timestep criteria for Aarseth-type integrators. For collisionless N - body systems, and indeed many non-astronomical Hamiltonian systems, symplectic integrators have enjoyed widespread popularity. Recent years have also seen a growing interest in exactly conserving integrators.

Reference-contexts: The popularity of symplectic integrators stems from the fact that the time-t flow of any Hamiltonian system is a symplectic or canonical mapping. One consequence of this is that the mapping is volume preserving in phase space. This is a consequence of Liouville's Theorem (see, for example, <ref> [56] </ref>), which states that the phase-space density of trajectories inside an ensemble remains constant with time. A symplectic integrator also preserves phase space volume to within the machine precision.

Discreteness noise can also introduce spurious heating of a collisionless cold disk, so that artificial disk-cooling mechanisms must be introduced <ref> [68, 57] </ref>. Dyer and Ip [22] note that equation (2) is physically inconsistent: particles act like Plummer distributions when they are contributing to the field, but are points when the field acts upon them, leading to a violation of Newton's Third Law and thus a violation of conservation of momentum.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, this exponential magnification of small errors led one astronomer to exclaim, "This view calls into question the very need for accurate simulation." [36] Miller <ref> [58] </ref> seems to have been the first to demonstrate that N -body systems display exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, even though all first integrals were well conserved and the evolution of the systems appeared plausible. <p> The fact that they could shadow the Lorenz equations 10 4 times longer using a rescaling of time is remarkable.

Reference-contexts: Most practitioners of physical simulation are optimistic that their results are at least statistically valid, but "even optimists need criteria to decide how accurate the integration has to be to yield valid statistical results." <ref> [62] </ref> We start with some definitions. The terms orbit, trajectory, and solution are used interchangeably.

Reference-contexts: A simple example of a shadowable system is provided by Quinlan and Tremaine <ref> [63] </ref>. Let x 00 = x, i.e., x 0 = v; v 0 = x in phase space, and let x (1) = v (1) = 0. The true solution is x = v = 0 8t. Now introduce "noise" v = " at t = 0. <p> GHYS presented their algorithm for the two dimensional case.

The basic idea is as follows. <p> In fact, even if some refinements are successful, numerical refinement alone does not prove rigorously that a true shadow exists; it only proves the existence of a numerical shadow, i.e., a trajectory with less noise than the original. QT <ref> [63] </ref> argue that if the refinement algorithm fails, there is good reason to believe that no shadow exists. They apply two arguments. First, from the more rigourous study of simpler systems, glitches are known to exist and are not just a failure of any particular refinement algorithm. <p> It is already known that glitches in N -body simulations occur most frequently near close approaches <ref> [62, 63, 33] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The discussion of symplectic integration for Hamiltonian systems in this section draws heavily from Sanz-Serna <ref> [66] </ref>, which is a very readable introduction to the subject. Another seminal paper is Channel and Scovel [13]. The question of what kind of integrator to use to integrate N -body systems is one that has had plenty of attention. <p> In general, even for non-smooth Hamiltonians, the discrete solution lies exponentially close in " to an exact solution to a nearby Hamiltonian problem, where " is the local error <ref> [66] </ref>. Non-symplectic integrators generally turn a conservative system into a dissipative one, while a symplectic integrator, on average over time, preserves the conservative nature of the system. Earn and Tremaine [23] point out that roundoff error actually destroys the exact symplecticness of a time- and/or space-continuous system. <p> However, symplectic integrators are often implicit, and require more function evaluations and smaller timesteps to produce the same computational accuracy as compared to standard non-symplectic integrators <ref> [66] </ref>. Thus, for short-term integrations where accuracy is paramount, a standard non-symplectic integrator may be more efficient. <p> For example, it is not clear precisely why one couldn't use their method to force conservation of phase space volume as well as energy, which we know to be impossible [71]. We will close our discussion of integrators with a remark by Sanz-Serna <ref> [66, p.278] </ref> (d is the dimension of configuration space): Conservation of energy restricts the dynamics of the numerical solution by forcing the computed points to be on the correct (2d 1)-dimensional manifold H = constant, but otherwise poses no restriction to the dynamics: within the manifold the points are free to

Reference-contexts: A true trajectory of a dynamical system lying near an approximate trajectory is called a shadow. A pleasant introduction to the shadowing idea is provided by Sanz-Serna and Larsson <ref> [67] </ref>. Although there exist other methods of global error analysis, shadowing is unique in that it demands that the equation governing the ODE remain fixed, while the initial conditions are perturbed in an effort to find a nearby true solution that remains close to the computed solution.

Reference-contexts: The effect of close encounters can be moderated via force softening, but the granular effect of the gravitational potential is strong even for particles that are separated by large distances ([75, section 1.3a], <ref> [68] </ref>). A common force computation method for collisionless systems is the particle-mesh method (eg., [61]), in which softening is implicit and equal to the distance between mesh points. <p> For particle-particle or tree methods for force computation, softening is added explicitly by modifying the gravitational force as jF ij j = G r 2 soft ; (2) where * soft is the softening parameter. It is usually chosen to approximate the average inter-particle distance. However, Sellwood <ref> [68] </ref> notes that if a disk is being simulated in two dimensions, then the softening parameter * soft can instead be used to approximate a disk of thickness * soft . <p> This structure is clearly visible in a disk of 2,000 particles after only 1 revolution, and is visible even in a disk with 20,000 particles after a few revolutions. Discreteness noise can also introduce spurious heating of a collisionless cold disk, so that artificial disk-cooling mechanisms must be introduced <ref> [68, 57] </ref>. Dyer and Ip [22] note that equation (2) is physically inconsistent: particles act like Plummer distributions when they are contributing to the field, but are points when the field acts upon them, leading to a violation of Newton's Third Law and thus a violation of conservation of momentum. <p> Astronomers have also been successful in producing realistic-looking spiral structure in collisionless disks, but it is not clear that the simulations produce this structure for the same reason that real spiral galaxies do <ref> [68] </ref>. One of the strongest reasons for suggesting caution in the interpretation of results of N -body simulations is that N -body systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: In addition to symplectic integration, there is an active and quickly blooming body of literature on exactly conserving algorithms. In general, there does not exist an integrator that is both symplectic and exactly energy conserving for Hamiltonian systems <ref> [69, 71] </ref>. However, since energy is not the only quantity conserved in most systems, there is still the possibility of building a symplectic integrator that conserves other quantities, although there are limits to what the integrator can conserve in comparison to the real system [25]. <p> One must be careful, however, how one enforces energy conservation. It is plausible that a method which naively enforces global energy conservation may introduce spurious mechanisms of energy transport within the system <ref> [69] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Using frequency analysis, for example, chaotic motion is associated with a broad spectrum while periodic motion is associated with peaks. Poincare's surface-of-section method turns periodic orbits into points, quasi-periodic orbits into lines, and chaotic motion into an irregular distribution of points.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for short-term integrations where accuracy is paramount, a standard non-symplectic integrator may be more efficient. Another drawback of symplectic integration is that any integration scheme which is symplectic for constant timestep does not remain symplectic if the timestep is changed based solely and explicitly on the state vector <ref> [71] </ref>. Recall that the time-t map produced by a symplectic integrator lies exactly (or exponentially close to) the true time-t flow of a slightly perturbed Hamiltonian problem. However, if t changes, then 6 the problem we are close to also changes. <p> In addition to symplectic integration, there is an active and quickly blooming body of literature on exactly conserving algorithms. In general, there does not exist an integrator that is both symplectic and exactly energy conserving for Hamiltonian systems <ref> [69, 71] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This seems very impressive. They do not mention any theoretical results on the symplecticness of their method, however.

Reference-contexts: Thus, there is little use in attempting to measure statistics any more accurately than this limit dictates <ref> [74, 73, 35, 38] </ref>. <p> However, Lecar [53] chose to measure different statistics, and found them to vary widely depending on which machine or algorithm was used to integrate the problem. This will be further discussed below. 2.2.1 Efficiency of many small vs. one large simulation Smith <ref> [73] </ref> and Heggie [38] have noted that n simulations each with N=n particles is much less expensive than 1 simulation with N particles, and is also completely trivial to parallelize. <p> Again, we are led to the conclusion that increasing N is the most desirable way of increasing the reliability of N -body simulations. 2 That is, no finite list of statistics completely describes a full phase-space trajectory. 3 Smith <ref> [73] </ref> continued his previous study ([74]) to ascertain the effects of different numbers of particles on statistical measurements.

Reference-contexts: Thus, there is little use in attempting to measure statistics any more accurately than this limit dictates <ref> [74, 73, 35, 38] </ref>. <p> Also, a disadvantage of using direct N -body simulation to collect statistics is that only a small amount of the wealth of information in a full N -body simulation is ever extracted. 2 Thus direct N -body simulation is not a particularly information-efficient method of gathering statistics [35].

This is the case even if the integrator is symplectic <ref> [76, 26] </ref>. Thus, when attempting to shadow a numerical solution, it may be necessary to "rescale" time [16, 17, 18, 80].

Reference-contexts: They discuss several other examples of unpredictable behaviour of a numerical solution in comparison with the solution produced by enclosure methods. Based on these results, they question whether true solutions of the Lorenz equations, or even of celestial mechanical systems that are generally believed to be chaotic <ref> [81, 78, 52] </ref>, are in fact chaotic. They further use this result to claim that shadowing results for ODEs are practically useless since, they (erroneously) claim, there is no iron-clad guarantee of a bound on local error.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is this author's opinion that much interesting work remains in the area of integration of conservative systems. 4 Miscellaneous comments concerning dynamical systems Szebehely <ref> [79] </ref> quotes Poincare's definition of a non-integrable system as one in which "no analytical and globally valid integrals (invariant relations between variables) exist besides energy, momentum, and center of mass." He notes several formal ways of recognizing a chaotic system.

Reference-contexts: That is, one explicitly constructs a subspace around the numerical orbit which must contain a true orbit. This is essentially an interval arithmetic, or enclosure method (see, eg., [59]). In contrast, shadowing lemmas are capable of proving the existence of a shadow non-constructively <ref> [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 60, 80] </ref>. <p> This is the case even if the integrator is symplectic [76, 26]. Thus, when attempting to shadow a numerical solution, it may be necessary to "rescale" time <ref> [16, 17, 18, 80] </ref>. <p> This linear growth of errors is due to a lack of hyperbolicity in the direction of the flow in phase space <ref> [80] </ref>. For large t, this can be a significant difference, so a shadowing algorithm which does not take the re-scaling of time into account is likely to grossly underestimate the length of the shadow.
