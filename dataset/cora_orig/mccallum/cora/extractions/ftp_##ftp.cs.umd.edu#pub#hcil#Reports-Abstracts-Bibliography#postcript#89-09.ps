Title: Incidental Learning During Information Retrieval: A Hypertext Experiment  
Author: Tricia Jones

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland  
Abstract: A study was conducted in a hypertext environment in order to examine the effects of the type of fact-retrieval search (browsing vs. index-using) on incidental learning. It was hypothesized that browsing would lead to more incidental learning; from a cognitive viewpoint, it would appear that browsers would have more opportunity to make connections between the various articles, which would result in a more complete understanding of the material. No significant results were found at the level of overall performance; however, by examining individual questions and the log files of various subjects, insight was gained into the search process. These trends were discussed in terms of implications on the use of hypertext for education. Many suggestions for designers of hypertext databases were given, along with suggestions for further research.

Reference-contexts: Many studied the effects due to age differences (generally attributed to the development of selective attention). Many, including Craik and Tulving, lean towards an elaboration of encoding theory, and examine the effects of depth of processing and episodic memory <ref> (see Lindberg and Wickens, 1979) </ref>. Dixon studies the effect of personality factors such as motivation and locus of control on incidental learning conditions (see Dixon and Cameron, 1976). <p> Barker and Hapkiewicz <ref> (1979) </ref> also attempted to account for various types and levels of behavioral objectives. The two types they focused on were knowledge level (e.g. the learner will accurately define X) and evaluation level (e.g. the learner will effectively compare and contrast the theories of Y and Z).

Reference-contexts: His main finding was that giving behavioral objectives, learning directions, or questions before an in structional text is read leads to some improvement in the learning of goal relevant material; however, these preinstructional acts impede the learning of goal irrelevant material (i.e. incidental learning) <ref> (Klauer, 1984, p.323) </ref>. Barker and Hapkiewicz (1979) also attempted to account for various types and levels of behavioral objectives.

Reference-contexts: Questions which are more complex and less focused may lead to more incidental learning, as more information must be processed in order to obtain the correct answer. It is conjectured that such questions might be better explored through browsing than by use of an index <ref> (Wang, Liebscher, and Marchionini, 1987, pp. 6, 14) </ref>. One recent study involving incidental learning from a full-text environment (as opposed to word lists) investigated the effects of text features on vocabulary acquisition (Herman, Anderson, Pearson, and Nagy, 1987). <p> _ 2 _ ______________________________________________________________________________ Table 2: Taxonomy Rankings for Incidental Questions According to Wang, et al., "complexity and specificity are generic [system-independent] and objective; focus is generic but subjective; path is objective but system-based; accessi bility describes the interaction of the user's knowledge base, the search task, and the system". <ref> (1987, p. 6) </ref> All questions generated were ranked independently by the experimenters. Agreement on the ratings was checked before selecting a question. Target questions were chosen by examining the rankings and attempting to mix levels of difficulty.

Reference-contexts: Most literate people feel quite comfortable with the concept. Browsing, on the other hand, does not seem to be as well-defined or concrete. Browsing can be defined as an exploratory, information-seeking strategy that depends on serendipity. It is especially appropriate for ill-defined problems and for exploring new task domains. <ref> (Marchionini and Shneiderman, 1988, p. 71) </ref>. Marchionini defines browsing as a highly interactive process with multiple decision points which depend on feedback to help determine what to do next. He goes on to explain various browsing techniques, ranging from random and informal to systematic and formal.

Reference-contexts: Dixon studies the effect of personality factors such as motivation and locus of control on incidental learning conditions (see Dixon and Cameron, 1976). Another study investigated pupillary dilation as a possible index of task difficulty for various orienting tasks during incidental learning <ref> (Krinsky and Nelson, 1981) </ref>. Educational psychologists seem to have a less diverse range of research experiments, but more diverse results. Their research tends to focus on the impact of behavioral objectives and pre-organizers on the amount of intentional and incidental learning.
