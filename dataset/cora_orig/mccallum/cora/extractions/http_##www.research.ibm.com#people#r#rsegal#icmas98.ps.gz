Abstract: We explore the dynamic behavior of information economies: very large open economies of automated information agents that will exist on the Internet. Such large interacting systems are likely to exhibit emergent phenomena not straightforward to anticipate. We model a simple information economy that revolves around economically-aware news-filtering brokers to whom consumers choose to subscribe. Our analyses and simulations reveal interesting emergent phenomena. One negative phenomenon we observe is price war instability manifested as limit-cycle behavior, looping among substantially suboptimal states. One positive phenomenon we observe is fairly efficient niche specialization by brokers in which the market effectively self-organizes.

Does this mean that agent economies are doomed to failure? Certainly not. For example, the second limit cycle we observed can be broken if a broker includes a certain amount of foresight into its price-setting algorithm.
