Reference-contexts: For the system to run a user's job, the user must supply the system with enough "money" to cover the cost of running the job. "Money" in this context refers to an electronic currency represented as coins <ref> [1] </ref>. Coins are available in various denominations, and are represented as an encrypted serial number. Coins are issued by a system-wide bank, which keeps track of the serial numbers that have been issued. <p> All verification transactions between servers and the bank are encrypted, and a multiple-key public-key protocol is used to verify the validity of coins <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, the bank's public keys must initially be distributed to all members of the system. <p> (t; Cost (t) in the simplest case (assuming a piecewise linear cost function between those points), or, in an expanded version of the system, it could be a representation of a continuous mathematical function. 4.1.4 Coins Coins in this system are represented as described in the DigiCash electronic money system <ref> [1] </ref>. Essentially, a coin is a bank-issued serial number that has been digitally signed by the bank's private key. The bank has a number of private keys, each one representing one possible denomination for a coin.

Reference-contexts: Thus, all interactions between the server and user agent take the form of requests from the agent and responses by the server. Because the HTTP 1.1 specification <ref> [2] </ref> allows arbitrary delay between request and response, it is possible to simulate server-initiated contact by having the user agent keep an open connection to the server while its job is running (if the client dies, it can later reconnect to the server using the global PID for its job).
