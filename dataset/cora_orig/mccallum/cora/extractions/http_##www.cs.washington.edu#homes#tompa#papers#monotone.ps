Abstract: We present direct proofs of the following results of Shamir and Snir [Mathematical System Theory, 13, 301-322, 1980] on the depth of monotone arithmetic circuits over rings of characteristic 0: (1) an ((log p)(log n)) lower bound for computing the product of p n fi n matrices; and (2) an (n) lower bound for computing the permanent of a n fi n matrix.

Reference-contexts: Since there are at least log 2 p multiplication nodes on , m log 2 p, it follows that a (log 2 p)(log 2 n). 2 The following problem is the arithmetic analogue of Boolean matrix transitive closure, for which Karchmer and Wigderson proved lower bounds on monotone Boolean depth <ref> [1] </ref>. Corollary 7 Let C be a monotone arithmetic circuit for raising an n fi n matrix to the n th power. Then C has depth (log 2 n). Proof: First consider the case in which n = p (p + 1) for some integer p.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to give a similar simple proof of Shamir and Snir's lower bound for computing the symmetric polynomials. Establishing similar lower bounds for general nonmonotone circuits seems difficult. Using a noncommutativity assumption, Nisan <ref> [2] </ref> has established an (n) lower bound on the depth of nonmonotone circuits for computing the permanent.

Reference-contexts: Using a noncommutativity assumption, Nisan [2] has established an (n) lower bound on the depth of nonmonotone circuits for computing the permanent. Finally, it should be pointed out that the notion of saturation used in this paper is a refinement of complement and content used by Snir and Shamir <ref> [3] </ref> to prove lower bounds on monotone circuit size.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we give short and direct proofs of the following lower bounds due to Shamir and Snir <ref> [4] </ref>. 1. Any monotone circuit for computing the product of p n fi n matrices must have depth ((log p)(log n)). 2. Any monotone circuit for computing the permanent of an n fi n matrix must have depth (n).

Reference-contexts: , and it can increase at most by a factor of two at an addition gate, there must be at least n 1 addition gates on the path . 2 4 Conclusion The model used in these proofs can be extended to allow certain constant gates, as suggested by Valiant <ref> [5] </ref>. In particular, let C be the set that results from closing the circuit's constants together with 1 under + and fl.
