Abstract: In distance learning and self-paced instruction, student evaluation with prompt feedback has always been a critical issue. Instructors and teaching assistants are often confronted with scores of email messages per day from students, the need to work night and day to grade exams, and heavy workloads late in the term. This paper describes the design of an automatic evaluation system that aims to eliminate some of the workload on instructors, by providing a convenient way of authoring interactive quizzes while addressing issues of reuse, portability and immediate feedback to students. We build on the standard models of Computer-based Training (CBT) and Web-based Training (WBT) systems, showing how we can combine their best features and overcome some of their problems, keeping in mind the specific requirements of our educational environment.

Reference-contexts: Although presentation is very important, when authoring specific types of documents like online quizzes, much of the presentational syntax carried by HTML-type languages can be omitted in exchange for better standardization (e.g., predefined styles) and higher consistency. Secondly, if we concentrate instead on structural or descriptive markup <ref> (Coombs, Renear, & DeRose, 1987) </ref>, the contents are emphasized (as opposed to the presentation), leading to a more usable and well-defined authoring process, and better document integration with searchable digital libraries and test banks.

Reference-contexts: Probably the most interesting feature, nevertheless, is the ability to write adaptable quizzes (also called sequential quizzes) <ref> (Hansen, 1967) </ref>, i.e., quizzes that provide remedial or progressive questions depending on the students performance on previous quizzes. Suppose, for example, that student Lucio achieves zero points on question 1 and ten points on question 2.

Reference-contexts: We opted for MSQL because it provides a powerful API, database administration commands (including access control), and locking capabilities. Additionally, MSQL is freeware, very popular among CGI script developers, and used in many groupware and database applications <ref> (Rowe, 1996) </ref>. 3.2 The SGML compiler On the interface side, we developed a compiler that takes quiz markup and generates the answer files and HTML pages necessary for the runtime system. This compiler is completely independent, and can be run on any machine.

Reference-contexts: Conclusion and Future Developments It is our primary goal to distribute the QUIZIT system to instructors in different departments on campus and in other universities. While we acknowledge that the use of multiple-choice-type exams as an assessment tool has many pitfalls <ref> (Shlechter, 1991) </ref>, we think of our system as a complementary evaluation tool for instructors, specially in distance learning and self-paced education.

Reference-contexts: Table 1: Strengths and Weaknesses of CBT/WBT systems This paper describes the design and implementation of an automatic WWW-based quiz system called QUIZIT, currently being developed in the Virginia Tech Computer Science Department <ref> (Tinoco, 1996) </ref> , that will be used in several online courses available for distance and self-paced instruction. The following sections will present the technical features that distinguish QUIZIT from other systems. <p> We hope to see if the use of QUIZIT reduces the grading overhead on instructors, and if the system is easily usable by students. A training plan is already in place to help instructors getting started with the authoring language <ref> (Tinoco, 1996) </ref>, but further recommendations on how to apply QUIZIT in the classroom still have to be organized. During the design of the authoring interface and the DTD, a participatory design proved to be very effective in identifying potential usability problems.
