Abstract: Tech Report GIT-COGSCI-97/04 Abstract This paper identifies goal handling processes that begin to account for the kind of processes involved in invention. We identify new kinds of goals with special properties and mechanisms for processing such goals, as well as means of integrating opportunism, deliberation, and social interaction into goal/plan processes. We focus on invention goals, which address significant enterprises associated with an inventor. Invention goals represent seed goals of an expert, around which the whole knowledge of an expert gets reorganized and grows more or less opportunistically. Invention goals reflect the idiosyncrasy of thematic goals among experts. They constantly increase the sensitivity of individuals for particular events that might contribute to their satisfaction. Our exploration is based on a well-documented example: the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. We propose mechanisms to explain: (1) how Bell's early thematic goals gave rise to the new goals to invent the multiple telegraph and the telephone, and (2) how the new goals interacted opportunistically. Finally, we describe our computational model, ALEC, that accounts for the role of goals in invention.

Reference-contexts: The whole invention process may be driven sometimes only by experimentation (i.e., tinkering). This requires specific inference mechanisms which distinguish invention goals from knowledge goals. The role of social interaction was in general minimized in cognitive models of invention. Both IMPROVISER (Wills and Kolodner, 1993) and IDeAL <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1993) </ref> propose an oracle for modeling external interaction. In IDeAL, an oracle supplies the needed information when the system itself fails to solve a problem and the system assimilates the new information so as not to fail for the same reason in future. <p> Previous event-driven architectures (Hayes-Roth & Hayes-Roth, 1979; Wilensky, 1983) emphasized the opportunistic aspect of control and goal generation, but did not provide enough specific tools for balancing the deliberative aspect. Other cognitive models for invention, like IDeAL <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1993) </ref>, ignore completely the opportunistic aspect of control, but rely on the existence of an oracle, which provide the right information at the right time.

Reference-contexts: The essential aspect of invention goal generation is that it is a deliberative process in invention. Let's exemplify the above ideas with the episode when Bell decided to approach the invention of the multiple telegraph <ref> (Bruce, 1973) </ref>. In October 1872, Bell read a newspaper article 6 describing the impact of a new telegraph system able to transmit simultaneously two telegraphic messages over the same wire (Stearn's duplex system).

Reference-contexts: The whole invention process may be driven sometimes only by experimentation (i.e., tinkering). This requires specific inference mechanisms which distinguish invention goals from knowledge goals. The role of social interaction was in general minimized in cognitive models of invention. Both IMPROVISER <ref> (Wills and Kolodner, 1993) </ref> and IDeAL (Bhatta & Goel, 1993) propose an oracle for modeling external interaction. <p> Namely, if invention goals cannot be pursued due to the lack of expertise, they may spawn expertise goals (broader learning goals) to get that expertise. In our view, two complementary and interacting processes are responsible for incrementally evolving an invention <ref> (Kolodner & Wills, 1993) </ref>: (1) Artifact Generator, which proposes new design solutions to the current design specification, and (2) Evaluator, which critiques the current design solution, by updating the design specification. Both processes rely heavely on the previous experience of the inventor.

Reference-contexts: Before that, an inventor must also estimate if he has the prerequisite knowledge and cognitive resources to pursue the idea successfully. In this respect, invention goals are similar to knowledge goals <ref> (Ram & Hunter, 1992) </ref>. Once an invention goal is generated, what processing mechanisms are relevant for pursuing it further? Once Bell decided to pursue an invention, he allocated significant cognitive resources to it.

Reference-contexts: Our model builds on the blackboard model of WM (Hayes-Roth & Hayes-Roth, 1979) and on the dynamic memory model of LTM <ref> (Schank, 1982) </ref>. Basically, changes in the WM generate events used to activate or generate new goals in the AGENDA. A Strategic Control process selects the next CURRENT GOAL from the AGENDA, based on a CONTROL PLAN. Let's elaborate the LTM of our architecture.

Reference-contexts: Once an invention goal is generated, what processing mechanisms are relevant for pursuing it further? Once Bell decided to pursue an invention, he allocated significant cognitive resources to it. But a recently processed invention goal may still remain active in background for a while <ref> (Simina & Kolodner, 1995) </ref>. By strategically choosing the current invention goal, an expert reasoner (e.g., inventor) may maintain a relevant network of active goals in the background.

Reference-contexts: the idea of the telephone, even if it was not in his thematic expertise domain (i.e., acoustics): If I could make a current of electricity vary in intensity, precisely as the air varies in density during the production of a sound, I should be able to transmit speech telegraph ically <ref> (Watson, page 8, 1913) </ref>. Social interaction, a phenomenon neglected in traditional accounts of goal/plan behavior, played an important role for the invention of the multiple telegraph and telephone. By social interaction, Bell learned new plans to achieve his invention goals.
