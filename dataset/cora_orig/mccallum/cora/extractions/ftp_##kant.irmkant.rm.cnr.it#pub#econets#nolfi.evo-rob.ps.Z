Reference-contexts: Different learning algorithms can be used for this purpose: i.e. backpropagation learning ( Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986); reinforcement learning <ref> (Barto, Bradtke & Singh, 1995 ) </ref>; classifier systems ( Booker, Goldberg & Holland, 1989); Kohonen Self- Organized Maps ( Kohonen, 1982), etc. These algorithms impose different constraints on the type of architecture that can be used and on the quantity and quality of the supervision required from the designer.

Reference-contexts: The fact that behavior is an emergent property of the interaction between the robot and the environment has the nice consequence that simple robots can produce complex behavior <ref> (see Braitenberg, 1984) </ref>. However it also has the consequence that, as in all dynamical systems, the properties of the emergent behavior cannot easily be predicted or inferred from a knowledge of the rules governing the interactions. <p> exceptions should be mentioned. 4 This does not imply that connectionism is the only possible way for studying behavior and cognition with an uniform conceptual framework. 8 Braitenbergs vehicles are probably the first clear demonstration that a simple agent can produce complex behavior by exploiting the complexity of the environment <ref> ( Braitenberg, 1984) </ref>. Pfeifer and Scheier showed how the problem of perception could be greatly simplified if the agents own movement and interaction with the environment is taken into account (Scheier & Pfeifer, 1995).

Reference-contexts: its characteristics with other approaches such as Behavior-Based Robotics, Robot Learning, and Artificial Life. 2 The Behavior-Based Robotics approach is based upon the idea of providing the robot with a range of simple basic behaviors and letting the environment determine which basic behavior should have control at any given time <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>. Basic behaviors are implemented in separate subparts of the control system and a coordination mechanism is responsible for determining which basic behavior should be activated or inhibited at any particular time.

Reference-contexts: By using real robots, several additional factors due to the physical properties of the robot and of the environment must be taken into account (e.g. friction, inertia, ambient light, noise, etc.) <ref> (Brooks, 1992) </ref>. Moreover, only realistic types of sensors and actuators (instead of idealized ones that may not respect all the physical constraints or may have infinite precision) can be used.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Evolutionary Robotics is the attempt to develop robots and their sensorimotor control systems through an automatic design process involving Artificial Evolution <ref> (Cliff, Harvey & Husband, 1993, Nolfi, Floreano, Miglino & Mondada, 1994) </ref>. Evolutionary Robotics approaches are based on genetic algorithms (Holland, 1975). An initial population of different "genotypes", each coding the control system (and possibly the morphology) of a robot, are created randomly.

Reference-contexts: For an example in which they can be successfully used to learn goal directed behavior in conjunction with evolution see ( Floreano and Mondada, 1996). 3 actuators <ref> (Cliff & Miller, 1996) </ref>, the shape of the robot ( Lund, Hallam & Lee, 1997 ), and the architecture of the control system (see Kodjabachian & Meyer, 1998) can be included into the evolutionary process. <p> I do not think that this can be claimed. Evolutionary Robotics has also a number of drawbacks, the most serious being the time needed to conduct the evolutionary process on the real robot <ref> (see Mataric & Cliff, 1996) </ref>. These drawbacks may prevent this approach from scaling up to the study of more complex forms of behavior. Moreover different approaches, by having different constraints and different characteristics, may be more effective in different circumstances.

Reference-contexts: Although I think that Evolutionary Robotics may be relevant for many different fields, I will restrict my analysis to Engineering, Ethology, and Biology. By doing so, it will become clear that the key characteristic of this approach is the possibility to rely largely on a self-organization process <ref> ( Floreano, 1997) </ref>. 2. An engineering perspective That behavioral systems such as mobile robots are difficult to design is undisputed. <p> However, in most of the experiments conducted in Evolutionary Robotics, the mapping is more complex than 6 Preliminary evidence that evolving individuals that are also allowed to adapt through lifetime learning may be able to adapt their strategy to the current competitor are described in <ref> ( Floreano and Nolfi, 1997) </ref>. 13 that.

Reference-contexts: By only varying the selection criterion, all other conditions being the same (i.e. number of individuals, mutation rate, lifetime length, architecture of control system, genotype-to-phenotype mapping, coding of the sensory-motor information, robot body) quite different forms of behavior can be obtained: (a) obstacle avoidance <ref> ( Floreano & Mondada, 1994) </ref>; (b) exploration (Lund & Hallam, 1996); (c) navigation ( Nolfi & 14 Miglino, in press); (d) discrimination of different objects ( Nolfi, 1997c); (e) escaping predators (Nolfi & Floreano, in press).

Reference-contexts: Pfeifer and Scheier (1997), for example, proposed a list of design principles which should help researchers both to design artificial agents and to understand natural organisms. Another possibility, of course, is to use evidence from neurophysiology when it is available at a sufficient level of detail <ref> (see, for example, Franceschini, 1997) </ref>. We will return to this issue in the last section. 9 sensory information coming from two pixels of the camera. Clearly the two targets cannot be discriminated by using only two pixels without relying on sensory-motor coordination. 4. <p> By carefully studying the vision system of the fly he came up with a model so detailed that it was easy for him to implement it in a mobile robot able to navigate in an environment by visuo-motor coordination <ref> ( Franceschini, 1997) </ref>. For another example in the case of rat navigation see Burgess, Donnett, & O'Keefe (1998). In cases like this, there is no need of self-organization processes at all. We just need to understand what emerged from natural evolution.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, in trying to evolve robots able to reach the upper right hand or bottom left hand corner of a rectangular box starting from eight different positions <ref> (an experimental task studied by Gallistel with rats, see Gallistel, 1990) </ref>, it was found that evolved robots were able to solve the task by carefully selecting the speed of the two wheels in the absence of stimulation.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, only realistic types of sensors and actuators (instead of idealized ones that may not respect all the physical constraints or may have infinite precision) can be used. Similarly, the sensory inputs and the motor outputs should necessarily correspond to physical measures or forces <ref> (i.e. they are grounded representation, see Harnad, 1990) </ref> and cannot include any abstract information provided by the experimenter, even unconsciously. Finally, only information truly available in the environment can be used for training.

Reference-contexts: that they are applied to their own results in a way that resembles the process of cell duplication and differentiation (see Kodjabachian & Meyer; this special issue ); (c) plasticity (i.e. the likelihood of being influenced by the external environment (see the previous Section)); (d) genotypes which vary in length <ref> (Harvey, 1992) </ref>. The opportunity to study these features of development in isolation, to manipulate the way they are modelled, to generate huge amounts of data easily, may allow Evolutionary Robotics to help to understand the importance and the role of development from an evolutionary perspective.

Reference-contexts: The main strategy followed in order to overcome these difficulties has been that of Divide and Conquer: i.e. divide the problem into a list of hopefully simpler sub-problems <ref> (Harvey et al , 1997) </ref>. Classical approaches to robotics have often assumed a primary breakdown into Perception, Planning, and Action. However, this way of dividing the problem has produced limited results and has been criticized by a number of researchers.

Reference-contexts: A similar result can be obtained by evolving neural networks with a topology which may vary evolutionarily and which learn throughout lifetime by using unsupervised learning <ref> (Miller & Todd, 1990) </ref> or an architecture in which evolution selects different learning rules for different connections ( Floreano and Mondada, 1996). In these cases the constraints on the architecture, which are evolved, channel the changes driven by the sensory states in the right directions.

Introduction Evolutionary Robotics is the attempt to develop robots and their sensorimotor control systems through an automatic design process involving Artificial Evolution <ref> (Cliff, Harvey & Husband, 1993, Nolfi, Floreano, Miglino & Mondada, 1994) </ref>. Evolutionary Robotics approaches are based on genetic algorithms (Holland, 1975). An initial population of different "genotypes", each coding the control system (and possibly the morphology) of a robot, are created randomly. <p> It can be shown, for example, that it is impossible to train a controller for a Khepera robot <ref> ( Mondada, Franzi & Ienne, 1993) </ref> placed in a rectangular arena surrounded by walls and containing a target object (a small cylinder) to find and stay close to the target by decomposing the desired behavior into basic behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it has been shown how, after training, it is not possible to find a simple correlation between module switching and basic behaviors (from the point of view of a distal description), rather, module switching is correlated with low-level sensory-motor mappings <ref> (Nolfi, 1997a) </ref>. 3. <p> For complex tasks, all individuals of the first generations are scored with the same null value, and as a consequence the selection process cannot operate <ref> ( Nolfi, 1997a) </ref>. I will refer to this problem as the bootstrap problem. One possible solution to this problem is to increase the amount of supervision. <p> I will refer to this problem as the bootstrap problem. One possible solution to this problem is to increase the amount of supervision. The insights of the experimenter can be used to include in the selection criterion also rewards 10 for subparts of the desired task <ref> (see Nolfi, 1997a) </ref>. Another possibility is to start the evolutionary process with a simplified version of the task and then progressively increase its complexity by modifying the selection criterion (the latter technique is usually referred to as incremental evolution, see Harvey et al., 1997).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, while in the Behavior-Based approach the breakdown of the desired behavior into simpler basic behaviors is accomplished intuitively by the designer, in the Evolutionary Robotics approach this is often the result of a self- organizing process <ref> (Nolfi, 1997b) </ref>. Indeed, the entire organization of the evolving system, including its organization into subcomponents, is the result of an adaptation process that usually involves a large number of evaluations of the interactions between the system and the environment (I will return to this issue in section 2).

Reference-contexts: One interesting approach, for example, is based on the identification of a set of designed principles which should guide the researcher in designing behavioral systems and, in doing so, to understand natural systems <ref> ( Pfeifer & Scheier 1998, in press) </ref>. The authors point out that models and experimental tools often rely on the implicit intuition of the designer and on her or his view of intelligence. <p> For example, if we want to achieve wall-following behavior we should not design a module for wall-following within the agent, but we should define basic processes which together, in the interaction with the environment, lead to this desired behavior. This is called design for emergence <ref> ( Pfeifer & Scheier, 1998, p.15) </ref>. Evolutionary Robotics fully shares this view of intelligence. Indeed design principles may provide a theoretical background for Evolutionary Robotics and help the researcher to understand the results of the evolutionary process.

Reference-contexts: However, as shown by <ref> ( Scheier and Pfeifer, 1995) </ref>, the task can be solved by using a control systems organized into separate layers (modules) if additional sensory information (the current and the previous state of the motors) is provided. 7 Biological molecules, cells, organs, organisms, and ecosystems are all entities at different levels which are <p> Pfeifer and Scheier showed how the problem of perception could be greatly simplified if the agents own movement and interaction with the environment is taken into account <ref> (Scheier & Pfeifer, 1995) </ref>. They described how a Khepera robot, by relying on three simple pre-designed basic behaviors (i.e. move-forward, avoid-object, and turn-toward object) can learn to discriminate between small and large cylinders.

Reference-contexts: This idea was previously proposed in the context of classifier systems by Dorigo & Colombetti (1994, 1997) who named it shaping, borrowing the term from the experimental psychology techniques used to train animals to produce predefined responses <ref> (Skinner, 1938) </ref>. These techniques, by requiring more supervision, increase the risk of introducing inappropriate constraints (see section 2). However, from an engineering perspective, it is easier to use the insight of the experimenter for shaping the selection criterion than for designing the control system itself.

Reference-contexts: It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem <ref> (Wagner & Altenberg, 1996) </ref>. The simplest genotype-to-phenotype mapping is the one-to-one mapping in which each gene codifies for a single character of the robot.
