Abstract: Symmetry Results for Reaction-Diffusion Abstract This article is concerned with symmetry properties of the solutions of the reaction-diffusion equation u + f(u) = 0 in a bounded connected domain in R N (N = 2; 3; : : :). Of especial interest are nonlinear source terms f of the type f(u) = u p u q with 0 q &lt; p 1. Two results are presented. The first result concerns the solution of a free boundary problem, where the domain is unknown and u and its normal derivative @ n u are required to vanish on the boundary @ of . It is shown that, if f is the sum of a continuous nondecreasing function and a Lipschitz continuous function on [0; 1), then the free boundary problem does not have a positive solution unless is a ball; in this case, any positive solution is radially symmetric around the center of the ball and decreasing with the radial distance from the center. The second result concerns the solution of the Dirichlet problem on a ball in R N , when the nonlinear source term f is continuous, but not necessarily Lipschitz continuous at 0. It is shown that, if f is the sum of a locally Lipschitz continuous function on (0; 1) that is nonincreasing near 0 and a function that is Lipschitz continuous on [0; 1), then any positive solution u is radially symmetric around the center of the ball and decreasing with the radial distance from the center.

Reference-contexts: general form of the free boundary problem is 8 &gt; : u (x) &gt; 0; x 2 ; (1:3) where the domain ae R N is unspecified and f is a nonlinear function that is defined and continuous on [0; 1), but generally not Lipschitz continuous at 0. 2 In <ref> [3] </ref>, Kaper and Kwong investigated the free boundary problem for the radially symmet-ric case, assuming that is a ball of (unknown) radius R centered at the origin, where the solution u depends only on the distance r = jxj from the origin.

Reference-contexts: The solution of (1.4) is unique if f satisfies the additional condition (F5) With fi as in (F2), u 7! f (u)=(u fi) is nonincreasing for u &gt; fi. The uniqueness follows immediately from an earlier result of Kaper and Kwong <ref> [4] </ref>, which is itself an extension of an earlier result of Peletier and Serrin [5].

Reference-contexts: Without loss of generality, we may assume that the ball is centered at the origin, so = B R (0). According to the celebrated result of Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg <ref> [6, Section 1.1, Theorem 1, and Section 2.3, Remark 1] </ref>, any classical solution of the Dirichlet problem, 8 &gt; : u (x) &gt; 0; x 2 B R (0); (1:8) is necessarily radially symmetric about the origin if f is the sum of a function that is continuous and nondecreasing and <p> If such a decomposition of f is not possible, then it is an open problem whether classical solutions of (1.8), if they exist, are indeed radially symmetric. Actually, the examples given in <ref> [6, Section 2.4] </ref> show that these cases could be very delicate. We prove the following theorem. <p> This is the result expressed in Theorem 2. Theorem 1 bears an interesting relationship to the celebrated result of Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg <ref> [6] </ref> quoted in the beginning of Subsection 1.2. <p> Suppose, furthermore, that P 2 @D lies on the boundary of a ball B in D. If u is continuous in D [ P and u (P ) = 0, then @ u (P ) &lt; 0 for any outward direction . Proof. See <ref> [6, Section 1.3, Lemma H] </ref> and [9, Chap. 2, Theorem 8]. The derivative @ u is defined as the derivative in the direction = ( 1 ; : : : ; N ); that is, @ = i @ i . <p> Proof. See <ref> [6, Section 1.3, Lemma S] </ref> and [10, Lemma 2]. The following lemma is a nonlinear generalization of the Hopf Boundary Lemma. <p> The assertion of the lemma follows from the Hopf Boundary Lemma (Lemma 2). The final lemma covers reaction-diffusion equations where f (0) is negative. It requires more smoothness of the solution u; cf. <ref> [6, Section 2.2, Lemma 2.1] </ref>. Lemma 5 Let f be continuous on [0; 1), with f (0) &lt; 0. Suppose that u 2 C 2 (D) satisfies the inequality u &gt; 0 on D and that u + f (u) = 0 on D.
