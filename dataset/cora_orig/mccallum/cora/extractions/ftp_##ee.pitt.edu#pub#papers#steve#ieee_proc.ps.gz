Abstract: Modern computer buses are typically organized by the three functions of data transfer, addressing, and arbitration/control. In this paper we present a fiber based bus design which provides optical solutions for each of these functions. The design includes an all optical addressing system, based on coincident pulse addressing, which eliminates the latency contribution and bandwidth limitation associated with electronic address decoding. The control system uses time of flight relationships between a priority chain and a feedback waveguide to implement fully distributed asynchronous and self-timed bus arbitration. fl Copyright (c) IEEE, This paper appeared in IEEE Proceedings 82(11):1701:1710

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a synthesis of several investigations into the key issues of optical bus design. Separate solutions have been previously devised for the problems of data transfer <ref> [1] </ref>, device addressing [2], and arbitration/control [3] of an optical bus. We present here a complete and operational bus design, which verifies the compatibility of these techniques and analyzes their combined performance. The presentation is organized as follows, Section two, outlines previous research on both networks and optical bus implementations.

When such an implementation is not practical, multi-level taps can be used to reduce losses <ref> [2] </ref>, or fiber amplifier segments can be introduced to restore power [64] respectively. An analysis of the limits on power distribution in tapped fiber is presented in section 7.

Reference-contexts: However, there are there are obvious limitations to such substitution. For example, any interface between electronics and optics limits the speed of that interface to the speed of electronics. Even though optical pulses as short as few femto-seconds may be generated and detected <ref> [32, 33, 34, 35] </ref>, such short pulses may not be useful to transmit data on an optical bus without an electro-optic interface of comparable speed. In other words, the speed of electronics bounds the transmission speed of optical buses.

Reference-contexts: This retains the favorable power distribution characteristics of the star coupler. When such an implementation is not practical, multi-level taps can be used to reduce losses [2], or fiber amplifier segments can be introduced to restore power <ref> [64] </ref> respectively. An analysis of the limits on power distribution in tapped fiber is presented in section 7. <p> There are three solutions to this problem. First, is the use of more sophisticated taps that use cladding modes to give tapping ratios as small as 36db [68]. Second is the use of non-linear fiber 18 amplifiers to restore power on the bus <ref> [64] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Assuming that tolerances for electronic components and errors in fiber length measurements can be compensated for by tuning the system, the primary sources of synchronization error will be thermal variations in both the optical characteristics of the fiber and in the performance of electronic components. For the former, studies <ref> [65] </ref> have shown that the variability of the index of refraction of the fiber versus temperature is on the order of 40ps/kilometer-degree C, and that this is the dominant temperature effect. This represents a very minor variation in effective time delay.

In this analysis, we use passive, bidirectional, 2 fi 2, symmetric fiber couplers <ref> [66, 67] </ref> and assume no excess loss in the couplers. Since the couplers are symmetric and bidirectional, either side can be considered the input or the output.

Reference-contexts: There are three solutions to this problem. First, is the use of more sophisticated taps that use cladding modes to give tapping ratios as small as 36db <ref> [68] </ref>. Second is the use of non-linear fiber 18 amplifiers to restore power on the bus [64].
