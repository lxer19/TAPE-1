Reference-contexts: We propose that these problems can be solved by assimilating governed gerunds to bare IPs, much like the exceptional bare IP arguments of raising and ECM predicates. This hypothesis allows us reduce the contrasts in (6) and (7) to the fact that IPs cannot be extraposed <ref> (Baltin 1981) </ref>. We can also account for the possibility of subject-aux inversion over gerunds seen in (8)a as deriving from the stipulation that IP sentential subjects may appear in the spec (IP) position of a clause, while CP sentential subjects may not (cf. Koster 1978).

Reference-contexts: This difference has no obvious significance for a transformational analysis; but, as we will see, if we state our grammatical analysis of these constructions in the formalism of Tree Adjoining Grammar <ref> (Joshi 1985) </ref> and use, with some refinements, the analysis of wh-movement in Kroch (1989b), we can derive the differences between nominalizations and gerunds from differences in the formal operations by which they are incorporated into a syntactic derivation: gerunds through simple TAG adjoining, and nominalizations through substitution and multi-component adjoining. 3

Reference-contexts: Hence, the empirical support we garner for our TAG-based linguistic analysis adds further interest to the use of TAG in developing computational learning and processing models <ref> (Joshi 1990, Frank 1992, Rambow 1994) </ref>. 1 Gerunds are ing forms, as in (i) below, while nominalizations are nouns related more indirectly to verbs, as in (ii): (i) Eating pickles is fun. (ii) Discussion of pickles is not fun. 4 2 The Problem of Gerunds The phrase structure and categorial status

Koster 1978) </ref>. Finally, the lack of wh-movement to the initial position of gerunds shown in (9)a is explained by the absence of a spec (CP) position necessary to license the appearance of a wh-element.

Reference-contexts: Under theoretical assumptions in which the effects of a raising to object transformation are disallowed by the projection principle <ref> (but see Lasnik and Saito 1991) </ref>, this sentence poses an apparent problem since there is licensed not as an argument of the verb prevent but rather as a part of the copular construction expressed by the gerund.
