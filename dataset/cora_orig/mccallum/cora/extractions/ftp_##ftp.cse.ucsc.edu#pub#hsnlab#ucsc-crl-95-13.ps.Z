Abstract: We study the performance of TCP/IP on a multi-hop ATM network by simulation in an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of various congestion-control schemes at the ATM layer. The congestion control schemes considered are the ATM-Early Packet Discard (ATM-EPD) and link-level flow control. The performance of these schemes are compared against that of an ATM layer with no congestion control, as well as TCP/IP over a datagram network. We compare the schemes in terms of the throughputs obtained by long and short connections, number of retransmissions, end-to-end delays, and fairness in bandwidth allocation between connections with unequal round-trip delays. Our results show that significant unfairness in the amount of bandwidth allocated to connections may result in a large ATM network if no congestion control policies are used at the ATM layer. The ATM-EPD scheme is able to remove some of the unfairness, providing performance close to that of a datagram network, but can still provide unacceptable performance if the buffer sizes in the switches are small. Link-level flow control provided the best performance among the schemes studied.

Reference-contexts: The simulation results do not include the first 0.5 second of simulation time to avoid the effects caused by the simultaneous opening of all the TCP connections. For the simulations of TCP over ATM networks, we used the ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (AAL 5) <ref> [1] </ref>. AAL 5 performs segmentation and re-assembly between IP packets and ATM cells. Each IP packet is extended by eight bytes at the AAL layer to accommodate the AAL header.

Based on the insights gained, further improvements of the algorithms continue to be made [2]. Modifications of the congestion control algorithms for use in high-speed networks have also been proposed [6]. <p> Thus, TCP may no longer be able to rely on the congestion control policies in IP gateways to provide fairness in usage of network resources among competing connections. TCP congestion control algorithms are already known to favor connections with shorter round-trip delays over those with longer delays <ref> [3] </ref>, and ATM may exacerbate the problem. A third difficulty in controlling congestion is caused by the connection-oriented nature of ATM. The ATM layer confines all the traffic in a TCP connection to a fixed path, making it difficult to cure long-term congestion by routing traffic away from congested spots. <p> This led to a faster convergence of TCP parameters to their actual values. We also added a small random component to the RTT of each segment in order to avoid phase effects in our simulations <ref> [3, 18] </ref>. The maximum size of the TCP congestion window was set to 64 Kbytes and was not a simulation parameter. The 3.

We used the TCP-Reno version for our simulations. However, since the TCP model supported by the OPNET tool is based on RFC 793, we made extensive modifications to support the congestion control mechanisms described by Jacobson <ref> [5] </ref>, exponential back-off, enhanced round-trip-time (RTT) estimation based on both the mean and the variance of the measured RTT, and the fast retransmit and fast recovery mechanisms. However, some adjustments had to be made to the TCP timers.

With the recent popularity of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), interest has risen on studying the behavior of TCP over ATM-based networks and internetworks. In these networks, all communication at the ATM layer is in terms of fixed-size packets, called "cells" in ATM parlance. <p> TCP seems to adjust well and to operate efficiently over this scheme. However, problems may arise if some of the proposed changes are incorporated to TCP to make it work more efficiently over networks with high bandwidth-delay products <ref> [6] </ref>. The TCP timing algorithms can fall into a periodic behavior which can cause unacceptably large number of early retransmissions. This problem needs to be investigated further.

Reference-contexts: Explicit congestion notification schemes are based on feedback, which sometimes make them too slow in reacting to congestion or changes in the available bandwidth, resulting in unacceptably high cell-loss rates <ref> [7] </ref>. An alternate approach is to use link-level (or, hop-by-hop) flow control for each virtual channel. This approach can completely eliminate packet losses due to congestion. Kung and Chapman proposed a number of schemes for flow-controlled virtual channels (FCVC) based on this approach.
