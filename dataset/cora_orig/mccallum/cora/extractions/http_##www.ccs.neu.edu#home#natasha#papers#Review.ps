Title: The State of the Art in Ontology Design: A Survey and Comparative Review

Abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for comparing ontologies, and place a number of the more prominent ontologies into it. We have selected 10 specific projects for this study, including general ontologies, domain specific ones, and one knowledge representation system. The comparison framework includes general characteristics such as the purpose of an ontology, its coverage (general or domain-specific), its size, and the formalism used. It also includes the design process used in creating an ontology and the methods used to evaluate it. Characteristics that describe the content of an ontology include taxonomic organization, types of concepts covered, top-level divisions, internal structure of concepts, representation of part-whole relations, and the presence and nature of additional axioms. Finally we consider what experiments or applications have used the ontologies. Knowledge sharing and reuse will require a common framework to support interoperability of independently created ontologies. Our study shows there is great diversity in the way ontologies are designed and the way they represent the world. By identifying the similarities and differences among existing ontologies, we clarify the range of alternatives in creating a standard framework for ontology design.

Reference-contexts: This distinction is also very pronounced at all levels in Cyc and (Lenat & Guha 1990) devotes a lot of discussion to this issue. Lack of correspondence between ontologies in their top-level division poses an obstacle to integration of different ontologies. A. Campbell and S. Shapiro in <ref> (Campbell & Shapiro 1995) </ref> discuss an idea of a "mediation interface" that will translate statements made in one ontology to another ontology.

Reference-contexts: Logical constraints, for example, would rule out triangles with four sides, and empirical constraints would rule out talking birds. Constraints are represented as axioms and are inherited through the hierarchy to lower levels. Dahlgren's Ontology Kathleen Dahlgren in <ref> (Dahlgren 1988) </ref> presents a linguistically motivated ontology. One of the main points made by Dahlgren is that ontology should be closely linked to language and her ontology is based on extensive linguistic and psycholinguistic research. The primary construction principle in the ontology is cross-classification hierarchy. <p> These are assumed to be essentially parallel divisions. Then something is Individual and Real (COW) and something is Collective and Real (HERD). Figure 5 shows parallel portions of the ontology from <ref> (Dahlgren 1988) </ref>. Note that not all the links in the ontology are the of the same type (which makes it somewhat confusing): although most of the links are IS-A ones, some of the links used in the Collective part of the hierarchy are not.

Reference-contexts: Generalized-UM is used in a multilingual text generation system that uses stock phrases for each concept to generate text. Dahlgren's ontology was a basis for a text understanding system that reads newspaper articles to produce a cognitive model of the text content <ref> (Dahlgren 1990) </ref>. Plinius' application also falls into the class of natural-language systems: it is designed for extracting knowledge from titles and abstracts of articles in its domain and creates an interim knowledge base where the knowledge is associated with a particular abstract.

Reference-contexts: In GENSIM, each object, such as Protein, represents not a single molecule, but a homogeneous population of such molecules. The process knowledge base describes the potential behavior of objects in the system. The author uses a Qualitative Process Theory <ref> (Forbus 1984) </ref> approach to represent processes, and each process has a very detailed frame that includes not only such parameters as inputs and outputs of reactions, but also preconditions for a reaction to occur and effects of a reaction.

Reference-contexts: It is unclear how this approach can be extended beyond chemistry, or how processes and properties would be represented. Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) The Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a language for defining ontologies <ref> (Genesereth & Fikes 1992) </ref>. It provides for the definition of objects, functions and relations. KIF has declarative semantics and it is based on the first-order predicate calculus. It provides for the representation of meta-knowledge and allows for the representation of non-monotonic reasoning rules.

Reference-contexts: Being an interchange format, it is very tedious to use for specifications of ontologies per se, but there are systems built on top of it which allow an ontology to be specified in the familiar terms of classes, relations, etc. An example of such a system is Ontolingua <ref> (Gruber 1992) </ref> which is a set of tools for analyzing and translating ontologies. <p> We have also considered KIF which is a knowledge representation system since it also embodies an ontological framework: it provides ways (and limitations) for representing knowledge. A system called Ontolingua <ref> (Gruber 1992) </ref> is built on top of KIF and provides a common ontology-definition language. This of course is a first step in knowledge sharing and reuse: if different ontologies are to be shared they should at least be translatable into the same formalism.

Reference-contexts: Conceptualization consists of a set of objects, concepts and other entities about which knowledge is being expressed and of relationships that hold among them. Every knowledge model is committed to some conceptualization, implicitly or explicitly. An explicit specification of this conceptualization is called ontology <ref> (Gruber 1993) </ref>. Formally, an ontology consists of terms, their definitions and axioms relating them (Gruber 1993); terms are normally organized in a taxonomy. <p> Every knowledge model is committed to some conceptualization, implicitly or explicitly.

Formally, an ontology consists of terms, their definitions and axioms relating them (Gruber 1993); terms are normally organized in a taxonomy. <p> Most projects, however, envision various applications that would use the ontology and, thus, prove its conceptual coverage and practical usefulness (see the discussion on various applications ontologies were used for below). 5 Taxonomy Formally, an ontology consists of terms, their definitions and axioms relating them <ref> (Gruber 1993) </ref>; terms are normally organized in a taxonomy. This is where some disagreement among ontology researchers arises. Some say that axioms are central to ontology design and a complete or high-level taxonomy does not even have to exist (maybe only for visualization).

Reference-contexts: Within each of these ontologies, there are a number of small hierarchies (two or three levels deep) that represent small clusters of knowledge. Figure 7 gives an example of such a cluster. Axioms and relations are used to link knowledge from various clusters. GENSIM GENSIM <ref> (Karp 1993) </ref> is a genetic simulation system that represents and models enzymatically-catalyzed biochemical reactions whose substrates include macromolecules with complex internal structures, such as DNA and RNA. There are two sub-ontologies in GENSIM (called Knowledge Bases): class knowledge base and process knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Another frequently-found top-level categorization is Individual versus Collection. Both of these are top-level distinctions in Dahlgren's and Sowa's ontologies.

Reference-contexts: GENSIM employs override inheritance in its process hierarchy (property values in a subclass can override the corresponding values in a superclass), which leads to non-monotonicity, too. Sowa uses conceptual graphs which themselves use higher-order logic. Here are some cases when Cyc goes beyond first-order logic <ref> (Lenat 1995) </ref>: Certainty: each assertion is assumed true by default but one can make statements like "Assertion A is less likely than assertion B" Reification: turning a predicate or function into an object in the language.

Reference-contexts: Generalized-UM is one of the multilingual projects (it is based on English, German and Italian). One of the very interesting things that was done as part of the Plinius project, was implementing their ontology in several different knowledge representation formalisms <ref> (Speel 1995) </ref>. This was a substantial step in showing experimentally the independence of the ontology itself from the formalism that is used. The TOVE project made a significant step in an underdeveloped area of ontology research: formal evaluation.

Reference-contexts: them in categories; or should it be built top-down by identifying the most general concepts and creating categories at the most general level first? Or should some middle layer of concepts serve as a starting point and then the development goes in both direction from there - middle-out approach (see <ref> (Uschold & Gruninger 1996) </ref> for the argument for the third alternative)? More ontologies in the study used a bottom-up approach in constructing a hierarchy than top-down.

Reference-contexts: This is the issue of part-whole relations. There are several types of part-whole relation that may require different reasoning. For example, <ref> (Winston, Chaffin & Hermann 1987) </ref> differentiates the following types of part-whole relation: component-object (branch/tree); member-collection (tree/forest); portion-mass (slice/cake); stuff-object (aluminum/airplane); feature-activity (paying/shopping); place-area (Princeton/NJ); phase-process (adolescence/growing up). We were looking for different categorizations of part-whole relations and treatment for them.
