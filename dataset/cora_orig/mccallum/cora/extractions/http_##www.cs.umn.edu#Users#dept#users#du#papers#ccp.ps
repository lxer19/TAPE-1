Abstract: The IEEE 802.6 Standard Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) * for Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) has been proposed. It is based on a uni-directional twin bus architecture. The DQDB protocol lays more emphasis on the overall channel utilization than the fair sharing of channel bandwidth by all the stations. In this paper, we first describe the unfairness problem in which the upstream stations occupy most of the channel bandwidth while the downstream stations get fewer chances to transmit their packets. Many proposed possible fixes are also discussed. We propose a protocol called Cycle Compensation Protocol (CCP) which ensures fairness regardless of the ratio of end-to-end propagation delay to the slot-size and also achieves almost the same throughput and delay as those of DQDB. CCP also guarantees that the channel bandwidth acquired by a station is inversely proportional to the number of busy stations and will reach this state within a limited time delay. * A new version of DQDB has been adopted by the IEEE 802.6 Standard Committee. In this paper the original version of DQDB is considered.

Reference-contexts: There are multiple paths between each pair of source and destination. The routing overhead is minimal and no intermediate buffering is necessary. The standard protocol for MAN has been proposed by the IEEE 802.6 committee <ref> [DQDB88, Hull88, Moll88a, Moll88b, Newm88] </ref>. The Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) protocol describes the physical layer and the medium access layer for MANs. It is based on a twin bus architecture as shown in Figure 1. It consists of two counter-flowing unidirectional busses (Channels A and B). <p> The BUSY bit will be set to one by a station if it is transmitting a segment in that slot. The Distributed Queue is a mechanism for forming a global First In First Out (FIFO) transmission queue among ready stations <ref> [DQDB88] </ref>. Every station has a request_counter , a countdown counter (cd_counter ) and a local request queue counter (local_request_queue_counter ) as shown in Figure 3. They are initialized to zero when the stations are first brought up to operation. When a station is in operation, it continuously monitors both channels.

Reference-contexts: After all ready stations have been served, the head station will read REQ=0 and initiate a new cycle. The average intercycle gap is now equal to the round trip propagation delay from the head end station to the last active station, plus half a slot time. Du and Ghanta <ref> [Du88] </ref> proposed a similar improved scheme. It can guarantee 100% utilization if there are no less than R J T P J +2 stations ready in each cycle. (3) An additional bit REQUEST bit is added to the access control field.

Reference-contexts: That is, when a is large, the situation of unfairness still exists. However, for small to medium a the fairness of DQDB can be easily improved. We will only briefly introduce these approaches in Section 3. Other schemes to fix the unfairness problem have also been proposed <ref> [Hahn89, Khal89, Limb89, Mukh88, Fili89, Mull90] </ref>. We will also briefly discuss these schemes in Section 3. However, these schemes are designed to compensate certain stations based on the estimated traffic. <p> A small a (=0.25) would have created the unfair situation already. 3. Possible Approaches to Fix the Unfairness Problem There have been several proposed fixes to solve the unfairness problem <ref> [Hahn89, Khal89, Leu89, Limb89, Mukh88, Fili89, Mull90] </ref>. These proposals can be classified into two major categories based on the way the system load is calculated by each station : (i) statistics based and (ii) non-statistics based.

These proposals can be classified into two major categories based on the way the system load is calculated by each station : (i) statistics based and (ii) non-statistics based. <p> Also since a station needs to make an announcement before it becomes active, the delay to transmit the first segment can be longer. The problem is even worse when a station only transmits very few segments each time. 3.2.2. Bandwidth Balancing Scheme Hahne, Choudhury and Maxemchuk <ref> [Hahn89] </ref> proposed the Bandwidth Balancing Scheme. Instead of allowing a station to transmit a segment whenever its countdown-counter is zero and empty slots become available, it requires that a station transmits only a fraction a of the available empty slots during a period of time. <p> Note that only segments which have been transmitted are counted in the average delay computation. - 20 - 10-(b) - 21 - In Figures 10 (a)-(c), we present how quickly the Cycle Compensation Protocol responds to the traffic condition in the network and compare with the results in <ref> [Hahn89] </ref> (i.e., Bandwidth Balancing Scheme). These simulations assume three stations S 1 ,S 2 ,S 3 each becoming active at times 0, 5600 and 1680 respectively. Each finishes transmission (becomes idle) at times 12000, 9960 and 7840 respectively. The propagation delay between any two neighboring stations is 28 slot-times. <p> The curves may be vibrating or be completely flat depending on when the statistics are collected. In essence, with the CC Protocol, the average throughput has converged to a fair share of the total bandwidth. In summary, comparing with the Figure from <ref> [Hahn89] </ref>, the Cycle Compensation Protocol is more responsive to the traffic conditions on the network. It can reach fair state sooner than the Bandwidth Balancing Scheme. To compare the channel utilization of CCP with DQDB as shown in Table I, we carried out the same simulation on CCP. <p> We investigate four different configurations and in each configuration these five busy stations are in different relative locations.

Reference-contexts: That is, a station should be allowed to transmit several segments continuously if it has been transmitting less number of segments than it should and a station should temporarily stop transmitting if it has been transmitting more than it should. The cycle concept used in FASNET <ref> [Limb82] </ref>, which allows only one segment to be transmitted by each station in one cycle, seems a simple way to know how many packets a station should be compensated. <p> Cycle Compensation Protocol Before introducing the Cycle Compensation protocol, we first present the FASNET protocol which uses the cycle concept and is also based on the uni-directional twin-bus architecture. In FASNET <ref> [limb82, Limb83] </ref> the two end stations coordinate in synchronization to allow all ready stations transmit in a round-robin fashion. The slot format is as shown in Figure 5. Station S 1 initiates a cycle by setting the Start bit to 1.

These proposals can be classified into two major categories based on the way the system load is calculated by each station : (i) statistics based and (ii) non-statistics based. <p> In order to increase the channel utilization and to be fair to all the stations each individual station needs to modify its P i based on the channel activities, the estimated number of active stations and their traffic loads. 3.1.2. Load Controlled Scheduling of Traffic Limb <ref> [Limb89] </ref> proposed the Load Controlled Scheduling of Traffic (LOCOST) scheme. Every ready station measures the traffic intensity on the channels and then based on this measurement, it determines its transmission rate until the next measurement is made. <p> The g (Y) is then used to update the packet allowance X i used in the ith period. A decay factor, b, is applied to 'drag' X i toward a decay value X d to prevent X i of individual stations from diverging. The main idea in these approaches <ref> [Mukh88, Limb89] </ref> is requiring each station to monitor the traffic on the channels and based on the statistics observed to throttle its transmission rate accordingly. They indeed can improve the fairness of the protocol. However, there are two potential problems associated with these schemes.
