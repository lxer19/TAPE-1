Title: On the Correlation of Symmetric Functions  
Author: Frederic Green Clark University Thomas Thierauf 
Affiliation: University of Buffalo  Universitat Ulm  
Abstract: The correlation between two Boolean functions of n inputs is defined as the number of times the functions agree minus the number of times they disagree, all divided by 2 n . In this paper, we compute, in closed form, the correlation between any two symmetric Boolean functions. As a consequence of our main result, we get that every symmetric Boolean function having an odd period has an exponentially small correlation (in n) with the parity function. This improves a result of Smolensky [12] restricted to symmetric Boolean functions: the correlation between parity and any circuit consisting of a Mod q gate over AND-gates of small fan-in, where q is odd and the function computed by the sum of the AND-gates is symmetric, is bounded by 2 (n) . In addition, we find that for a large class of symmetric functions the correlation with parity is identically zero for infinitely many n. We characterize exactly those symmetric Boolean functions having this property.

Reference-contexts: The use of exponential sums points to the possibility of applying more sophisticated techniques. There is a strong connection between our sum and the (generalized) Gauss sum or Kloosterman sum (see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>) which we briefly illustrate below. Consider a polynomial f (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) with integer coefficients and degree d on n boolean variables. We consider the correlation between, e.g., this polynomial modulo 3 and the parity function .
