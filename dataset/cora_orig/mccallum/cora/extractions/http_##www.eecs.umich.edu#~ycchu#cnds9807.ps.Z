Abstract: The ATM network analysis tool (NetMod ATM) uses analytical models to provide the designers of large interconnected local and wide area networks with an in-depth analysis of the potential throughput capacity of these systems. The user interface of NetMod is implemented in Tcl/Tk and is compatible with any platform. The objectives of NetMod, the analytical models, and the user interface are described in detail.

Reference-contexts: For those desiring to estimate the throughput and delays associated with large scale networks (numbering in the thousands of nodes or higher), analytical (queuing) models became the logical alternative. One of the more prominent of those tools was NetMod, developed at the University of Michigan in 1991 <ref> (Bachmann 1991) </ref>. The principal application of the NetMod tool was to help the campus network designer to configure a potential users data network using proposed hardware and software components. <p> For the rest of this section we will discuss several important issues in NetMod ATM, such as new network elements, nodal models, and analysis methods. 2.1 Building Elements in ATM Networks In the original NetMod <ref> (Bachmann et al. 1991) </ref>, the user can build a large and complicated network model from network elements like the Ethernets, token rings, FDDI rings, and point-to-point links. NetMod ATM adds new elements for building ATM networks. <p> This assumption is reasonable whenever the input is a superposition of many independent renewal processes; this is typical in the systems being modeled. Previous studies also indicated the Poisson approximation is quite reasonable in network built with original NetMod elements <ref> (Bachmann et al. 1991) </ref>. We plan to test the validity of this assumption in ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: There are several simulation-based tools that allow the designer to layout the network as a system of Ethernets, token rings, and routers; e.g., NETWORK II.5 <ref> (Garrison 1990) </ref>, PLANS (Nishida et al. 1984), and BONES (Frost). While simulation models could provide more detailed statistics about the performance of the networks, they are very time consuming and do not scale well beyond a few dozen nodes.

Reference-contexts: The majority of analytic tools require the user to describe a physical network in terms of a network of queues; e.g., QNAP2 (Veran and Potier 1984), RESQME <ref> (Gordon et al. 1986) </ref>, NUMAS (Mueller 1984), and MANUPLAN II (Suri and Tomsicek). Consequently, this requires a more sophisticated user.

Reference-contexts: Most algorithms determine the route by choosing the shortest or least expensive path (Tanenbaum 1996). For native ATM application, the cost of path is defined by the QoS requirement (delay, delay jitter or cell loss) of each traffic flow instead of simply distance <ref> (Prycker 1995) </ref>. Without considering any QoS requirements, NetMod ATM uses the Bellman-Fords minimal spanning tree algorithm (Tanenbaum 1996) to determine the actual routing paths from a border switch to the rest of border switches. <p> The merit of this approach is that the routing path is optimized according to the distance (switch count) metric which is suit able for ATM traffic without specific QoS requirement like the IP and IPX traffic <ref> (Prycker 1995) </ref>.
