Reference-contexts: MSTs have been objects of interest in computer science research for a very long time (See <ref> [Graham et al 85] </ref> for an excellent history of MST research). Many robust and efficient algorithms are available to compute MSTs.

Reference-contexts: EMSTs in two dimensions can be constructed in an optimal O (N logN ) time and O (N ) space, by constructing the Delaunay triangulation of the points <ref> [Preparata et al 85] </ref>. Unfortunately, this result does not gracefully upgrade to higher dimensions, because then the size of the Delaunay triangulation can itself become exponential (in the number of dimensions).

Reference-contexts: Not much is known of optimal computation of EMSTs in higher dimensions. 2.2 Algorithm for EMST Computation We use the simple algorithm in Fig. 2.2 due to Dijkstra <ref> [Dijkstra 59] </ref> to construct the EMST of a set S of points. The algorithm builds the EMST incrementally. At any stage in the running of the algorithm, there is a partially formed EMST (of S 0 S).

Reference-contexts: MIN CLUSTER SIZE) cut all edges E 0 pivoted at v1 such that jE 0 if (count2 MIN CLUSTER SIZE) cut all edges E 0 pivoted at v2 such that jE 0 g 2.3 Clustering using EMSTs There have been many efforts to use EMSTs as a basis for clustering <ref> [Zahn 71, Johnson 67] </ref>. It can be understood is easily how EMSTs can be a basis for clustering. By definition of EMSTs, each edge in the EMST of a set of points S is the smallest edge connecting two partitions A and S-A of S.

Reference-contexts: Both our algorithms do not have this dependency. 3. Many EMST-based clustering procedures for astronomical datasets use a fixed "cluster radius" as a parameter <ref> [Battinelli 91] </ref>. All points lying in a circle of this radius are marked as a cluster. Though various clever techniques have been employed to compute the appropriate cluster radius for a dataset, these methods have an inherent disadvantage. <p> Stellar associations as sites of present and/or recent star formation can informally be defined as OB associations. The identification of a stellar association is a difficult task even in resolved galaxies. The problems in this task can be summarized as: subjectivity and mutual inconsistency of different identification techniques <ref> [Battinelli 91] </ref>. The former consists of investigator dependence of all published methods, and the latter stems from the fact that comparison of associations obtained using different identification methods may lead to spurious conclusions.

Reference-contexts: The program can be improved to work with different data formats (eg. symbolic features). * Alpha Shapes : As the clusters produced by this algorithm are similar to the alpha shapes of the dataset <ref> [Edelsbrunner et al 83] </ref> (CR being comparable to ff), we would like compare these two methods, to gain some insights into clustering procedures.
