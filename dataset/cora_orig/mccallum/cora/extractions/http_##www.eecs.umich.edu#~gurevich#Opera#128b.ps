Title: Monadic Simultaneous Rigid E-Unification and Related Problems  
Author: Yuri Gurevich Andrei Voronkov 
Date: June 20, 1997  
Abstract: We study the monadic case of a decision problem know as simultaneous rigid E-unification. We show its equivalence to an extension of word equations. We prove decidability and complexity results for special cases of this problem.

Reference-contexts: We shall sometimes write the left side of a rigid equation as a sequence of equations, for example x'a ` 8 g (x)'x instead of fx'ag ` 8 g (x)'x. In <ref> [2] </ref> it is shown that the decidability of SREU is equivalent to the de-cidability of some other fundamental problems, for example the following ones: Problem 1 (Formula Instantiation) Given a quantifier-free formula '(x), is there a term sequence t such that the formula '( t) is provable? Problem 2 (Existential Intuitionistic)

Reference-contexts: This result implies that Problems 1-4 are undecidable. * SREU with ground left sides is undecidable (Plaisted [11]). * SREU with ground left sides and two variables is undecidable (Veanes [14]). * SREU with one variable is DEXPTIME-complete (Degtyarev, Gure vich, Narendran, Veanes, and Voronkov <ref> [3] </ref>). The last two results imply a complete classification of decidable prenex fragments of intuitionistic predicate calculus with equality: the 99 fragment is undecidable and the 8 fl 98 fl fragment is decidable. All the above mentioned undecidability results require that the signature contain a function symbol of arity 2. <p> We prove Theorem 4 Monadic SREU is decidable if and only if the ideal membership problem is decidable. 3 We also prove the decidability of some special cases of monadic SREU. In Section 4 we prove a result similar to the result of <ref> [3] </ref>: Theorem 3 Monadic SREU with one variable is PSPACE-complete. As we already mentioned, Plaisted [11] proved that SREU with ground left sides is undecidable. The corresponding monadic case is shown to be decidable in Section 3: Theorem 2 Monadic SREU with ground left sides is decidable. <p> Then E (c); E (r) ` s (r) ' t (r). By Lemma 2.2 we can substitute r for c obtaining E (r) ` s (r) ' t (r). 2 Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 also hold for non-monadic signatures <ref> [3] </ref>. Lemma 4.3 Monadic SREU with one variable is in PSPACE. Proof. We shall give a non-deterministic algorithm reducing monadic SREU with one variable to the DFA intersection nonemptiness problem. Let R be a system of rigid equations of one variable x whose signature is (F ; C).

Reference-contexts: When all function symbols have arity 1, Problems 1-4 are equivalent to monadic SREU, i.e. SREU in the signature where all function symbols have arity 1. The decidability of monadic SREU is an open problem. The following facts are known about monadic SREU (Degtyarev, Matiyasevich and Voronkov <ref> [4] </ref>). * The word equation problem is effectively reducible to monadic SREU. * Monadic SREU with one function symbol is decidable (this fact has a non-elementary proof). * Monadic SREU is decidable if and only if it is decidable in the signature with two function symbols.

Reference-contexts: Problem 4 (Skeleton Instantiation) Given a formula ' and a derivation skeleton, is there a derivation of ' having this skeleton? 2 Some known results on SREU are the following. * SREU is undecidable (Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [5] </ref>). This result implies that Problems 1-4 are undecidable. * SREU with ground left sides is undecidable (Plaisted [11]). * SREU with ground left sides and two variables is undecidable (Veanes [14]). * SREU with one variable is DEXPTIME-complete (Degtyarev, Gure vich, Narendran, Veanes, and Voronkov [3]).

Reference-contexts: In addition, R can be effectively constructed from A using a polynomial-time algorithm. Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume that I consists of one state (see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>). By renaming states, we can assume that I = fcg. Let F be a unary function symbol fresh for F and d be a constant fresh for Q.
