Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: In this paper the simulation language ExSpect is described. This language is based on a formal framework closely related to Coloured Petri Nets (CPN). The fact that systems can be combined into larger systems is a very powerful feature and allows a structured top-down design. The module concept combined with the possibility to customise a system encourages the reuse of already specified components and the creation of `toolboxes'. One of the applications of this language is the description and simulation of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS).

Reference-contexts: MODELLING FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS We have used ExSpect to specify a broad class of systems. protocols information systems logistic systems flexible manufacturing systems Examples of logistic systems we have specified are a distribution centre, a transport system and a production unit <ref> (Aalst, Voorhoeve and Waltmans 1989) </ref>. Especially flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) appear to be an interesting area of application. These systems are char-acterised by flexible, concurrently operating and mainly automated elements, such as a production controller, a machine, an automated guided vehicle and a conveyor.

Reference-contexts: Therefore an urgent need exists for a (formal) framework which makes it easy to model complex production systems. Such a framework, called discrete event systems (DES), has been developed at Eindhoven University of Technology (Hee, Somers and Voorhoeve 1989a and 1989b). It is related to Coloured Petri Nets <ref> (Jensen 1987) </ref> and therefore we can use Petri Net theory to verify structural properties (Genrich and Lautenbach 1988). Every complex system that fits into this framework is called a discrete event system (des).
