Abstract: The Pierre Auger Project is an international collaboration to study the highest energy cosmic rays. With installations in the northern and southern hemispheres, the Auger Observatory will achieve uniform exposure to the entire celestial sphere, with the enormous collecting power needed for definitive studies of the extremely low cosmic ray intensity near the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin suppression. This note reviews the reasoning that has led to the hybrid design of a vast surface array of particle detectors along with air fluorescence detectors that observe the atmosphere above the array.

Reference-contexts: It is the only spectral feature that is suggestive of a transition from one population to another. To study the extragalactic population above the ankle requires an observatory of enormous collecting power, since the integral intensity above 10 EeV is only 0.5/(km 2 sryr). In 1992, Jim Cronin <ref> [1] </ref> suggested an international effort to construct a giant detector for this purpose, and that suggestion has been developed through a series of workshops into the specific Auger Observatory design proposal that is now under review.

Reference-contexts: An all-fluorescence observatory with a duty factor of 0.1 would need an aperture of 140,000 km 2 sr to achieve the same exposure rate. The most direct information about the extragalactic cosmic ray sources above 10 EeV should come from anisotropy studies. Fly's Eye data analysis <ref> [2] </ref> suggests that those particles are not highly charged heavy nuclei.

Reference-contexts: The hypothesis of 10 ffi smearing is a crude guess, which might be overestimating the dispersion. Recent analysis of AGASA data <ref> [3] </ref> suggests that there might be much tighter clustering. Even for 120 equally contributing sources with 10-degree smearing, a clumpy deviation from isotropy is evident in figure 1. The AGASA event clusters above 40 Eev [3] are suggestive of persistent discrete sources. <p> Recent analysis of AGASA data <ref> [3] </ref> suggests that there might be much tighter clustering. Even for 120 equally contributing sources with 10-degree smearing, a clumpy deviation from isotropy is evident in figure 1. The AGASA event clusters above 40 Eev [3] are suggestive of persistent discrete sources. Of the 36 events, there are 3 pairs of events whose directions cannot be resolved by the detector. <p> The observed celestial distribution is shown in 3 different coordinate systems. The lower right figure is a simulation of isotropy for comparison. AGASA data suggest a narrow excess at the supergalactic equator with no polar deficit <ref> [3] </ref>. In each case, the number of events is too small for confidence in the suggested anisotropy. the broad equatorial excess suggested by the Haverah Park data is real and there are no discrete sources observed.

Reference-contexts: Above about 50 EeV, therefore, one expects a prominent (l=2,m=0) spherical harmonic component when analyzed in supergalactic coordinates. There have been some tantalizing suggestions of cosmic ray anisotropy relative to the supergalactic plane in analyses of Haverah Park and AGASA data. The H.P. data suggest a broad equatorial excess <ref> [4] </ref> that can be described as a supergalactic polar deficit, whereas the 2 of showers is 1165. The bottom right is a simulation of isotropy. The other 3 figures simulate a number of equally strong discrete sources, and each source is smeared with a 10-degree Gaussian. Top left: 15 sources.

Reference-contexts: The sparse surface array is completely satisfactory while being the most economical detection method. 2 Energy spectrum Independent of any anisotropy that may or may not be observed, the energy spectrum of cosmic rays can provide important information about their sources and their propagation <ref> [5] </ref>. The details of the energy spectrum may depend on properties of the population of sources (e.g. the distribution of maximum rigidity of produced particles and magnetic confinement at the sources). It also is affected by the GZK suppression and therefore is sensitive to the distribution of source distances.

Reference-contexts: Although the aperture is smaller than at 10 EeV, there will be ample statistics due to the higher cosmic ray intensity. Detailed simulations have confirmed that the detector will make quality shower measurements at the lower threshold in hybrid mode <ref> [6] </ref> It was recognized [7] prior to the first Paris workshop in 1992 that measuring a shower with a single fluorescence detector along with the ground array would provide good geometrical reconstruction, so stereoscopic fluorescence measurements are not necessary.

Reference-contexts: This suggested that the hadronic interaction model used to map from (E em ,X max ) to (E,A) was unsatisfactory. The Gaisser-Stanev-Tilav minijet model (similar to Sibyll) was adopted to bring the scatter plot into the physically sensible region <ref> [11] </ref>. It has been argued [12] that any plausible model which is physically acceptable in this sense will preserve the observed feature of the scatter plot points moving to lower A-values with increasing energy.
