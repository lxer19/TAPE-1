Abstract: There are striking parallels between ecological psychology and the new trends in robotics and computer vision, particularly regarding how agents interact with the environment. We present some ideas from ecological psychology, including control laws using optic flow, affordances and action modes, and describe our implementation of these concepts in a small mobile robot which can avoid obstacles and chase or flee moving targets solely using optic flow. The properties of these methods were further explored in simulation. This work ties in with that of others arguing for a methodological approach in robotics which foregoes a central model/planner. Ecological psychology may not only contribute to robotics, but robotic implementations may in turn provide a test bed for ecological principles and a source of ideas which could be tested in animals and humans. Keywords: ecological psychology, behavior-based robotics, optic flow, obstacle avoidance, tag.

Reference-contexts: ECOLOGICAL ROBOTICS 26 Conclusion We have discussed behaviors like obstacle avoidance, the game of tag, and maze navigation which can be produced in a robot with no reconstruction of the visual scene <ref> (Aloimonos, 1993) </ref>. In addition, we have recently begun exploring the use of these behaviors as a basis for navigating a maze (Duchon, 1996). At a minimum, this work points to an approach eschewing a central model in favor of a tighter binding between action and perception.

Reference-contexts: More recently, it has evolved into purposive or animate vision (Aloimonos, 1993; Ballard & Brown, 1992), which attempts to go one step further by posing the question, "What is vision for?" <ref> (Ballard, 1991) </ref>. The first purpose of vision is to create those relationships between the animal and its environment which are necessary for survival. It may be that the animal does not need to model its environment to achieve these relationships.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the new approach <ref> (Brooks, 1991a) </ref> attempts to build up robots through networks of simple, fully functional behaviors mapping sensors to actuators, with no central model. Complex behavior emerges from the dynamic interaction between the agent, with its simple mappings, and the environment, producing what appears to be goal-directed action.

Reference-contexts: We have successfully implemented the Balance Strategy on two mobile robots. The small robot, named Louie, is an RWI B-12 (30.5 cm) base with a single camera with a 60 ffi horizontal field of view (FOV) placed about 75 cm off the ground. A fast patch-matching optic flow algorithm <ref> (Camus, 1994) </ref> provides a dense 128fi32 flow field at 4 frames per second, allowing us to control Louie moving at a speed of 4 cm/s.

Reference-contexts: Though not stated explicitly, the latter type of sequence seems inherent in the male hoverfly which only "rapes" another fly (male or female) after shadowing the target and the target lands on a flower or hovers for a period of time <ref> (Collett & Land, 1975) </ref>. That is, it only attempts to attack a motionless fly, thus the shadowing will have brought it to a standstill. <p> Within the foveal region (about 8 ffi in radius), the fly is able to maintain smooth tracking and keep the target well fixated <ref> (Collett & Land, 1975) </ref>. As will be described below, Equation 11 appears to have this same effect when a higher sampling density is used for the center of the FOV. <p> This is a problem of "reflex interaction" and has been noted in some types of flies, where the background flow does influence the ability to fixate the target <ref> (Collett & Land, 1975) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our work in ecological robotics has followed a series of steps from the concrete to the abstract. First, we dealt with the problem of a real robot wandering and avoiding obstacles using optic flow <ref> (Duchon & Warren, 1994) </ref> in a similar manner to that of others implementing ideas from the insect literature. Then we made some progress on a robot playing tag with a hand-held target without needing to segment the scene (Duchon, Warren, & Kaelbling, 1995). <p> These two operations have been transferred easily to a new, larger robot with little change, attesting to their generality. Recently, we have taken the strategies which were implemented in the robots and explored in simulation their utility and limits. ECOLOGICAL ROBOTICS 7 Obstacle Avoidance Control Laws Our first work <ref> (Duchon & Warren, 1994) </ref> investigated the use of control laws for the most crucial ability of a mobile agent: avoiding obstacles.

As with the obstacle avoidance, rotations were made every few frames.

"The affordance of anything is a specific combination of the properties of its substance and surfaces taken with reference to an animal" <ref> (Gibson, 1977, p. 67) </ref>. Strictly speaking, the "affordances" of surfaces in the environment are constant for a particular animal (Gibson, 1979) and are discovered in the course of learning. Every action mode constrains which affordances of an environment an animal might use on a particular occasion.

Reference-contexts: The similarities between these approaches and ours based independently on Gibsonian ideas suggests that the application of the theories and results from fifty years of ecological psychology will surely enhance this endeavor. Our work also ties in with recent physiological studies and lesion cases <ref> (Milner & Goodale, 1995) </ref> that suggest separate "what" and "how" pathways in the brain. The lesion cases have indicated a difference between knowing what an object is, and knowing how to maneuver it.

Reference-contexts: Upper Right: The Watcher fixates the Wander, detects an expansion, so escapes momentarily. Lower Left: The Wanderer moves away and the Watcher gives chase. Lower Right: The Watcher captures the Wanderer as the latter avoids a wall. zagging as an effective escape mechanism <ref> (Tinbergen, 1951) </ref>: this not only allows them to see their attacker (since they don't have a 360 ffi field of view), it also confuses the predator by making it think it is doing better than it is.

Reference-contexts: is the "fundamental hypothesis" of the ecological approach to vision: Optic structure specifies its environmental source and ... therefore, mobile organisms with active visual systems that can pick up this information will see their environments and suitably adjust their activity, if and when they detect that information, and only then <ref> (Turvey, Shaw, Reed, & Mace, 1981, p. 253, emphases ours) </ref>. Now, if we replace "mobile organisms" with "mobile robots," or more generally, "agents," this hypothesis is just as applicable to behavior-based robots as it is to animals.

Reference-contexts: It is possible that these control laws alternate [(Srinivasan & Bernard, 1977); a subsumption architecture would support this kind of behavior] or are all acting simultaneously with varying thresholds, constants (Virsik & Reichardt, 1976; Reichardt, 1986), time-scales <ref> (Wagner, 1986b) </ref>, dynamics (Schoner, Dose, & Engels, 1995), or schemas (Arkin, 1990). We have begun looking into these issues in the realm of maze navigation (Duchon, 1996).
