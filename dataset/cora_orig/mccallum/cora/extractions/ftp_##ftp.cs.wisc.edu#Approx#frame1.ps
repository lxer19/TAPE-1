Abstract: This paper considers the above three properties for subspaces H of L 2 (IR d ), and for sets X of the form with either a singleton, a finite set, or, more generally, a countable set. The analysis is performed on the Fourier domain, where the two operators T T fl and T fl T are decomposed into a collection of simpler "fiber" operators. The main theme of the entire analysis is the characterization of each of the above three properties in terms of the analogous property of these simpler operators.

We provide here a complete characterization of frames and tight frames in FSI spaces, and draw interesting connections between these notions and the notions of quasi-stability and quasi-orthogonality of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. We further give a comprehensive analysis of infinitely generated SI spaces, and employ in that course two complementary approaches termed here as "Gramian Analysis" and "dual Gramian Analysis". 1 1.2. <p> to a null-set) as := S () := fw 2 TT d : J (w) 6= 0g: An equivalent definition of the spectrum is: (1:4:5) := fw 2 TT d : [ b ; b ](w) 6= 0; for some 2 g: For a FSI space, it was proved in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> that the spectrum of S only relies on the space and is independent of any particular selection of the generators of the space. That proof can be carried on to infinitely generated SI spaces. Next, we want to decompose the operator T fl . <p> Frames in PSI spaces Throughout this subsection, S is a PSI subspace of L 2 (IR d ) generated by some (fixed) function. Motivated by the search for an explicit representation for the orthogonal projection onto shift-invariant spaces, <ref> [BDR1] </ref> introduces and studies the notions of quasi-stable and quasi-orthogonal bases for FSI spaces. For PSI spaces, in the terminology used in the present paper, its definitions are as follows: Definition 2.2.5. ([BDR1]) Let 2 L 2 (IR d ), and let T be the operator T : ` 2 (ZZ <p> Corollary 2.2.6. Let 2 L 2 (IR d ). Then E is a frame if and only if is a quasi-stable generator of S (). Further, this frame is tight if and only if is a scalar multiple of a quasi-orthogonal generator of S (). Thus, implicitly, <ref> [BDR1] </ref> contains an extensive discussion of frames in PSI spaces. Furthermore, as we had learnt from the referee of this paper, frames for PSI spaces were (explicitly) studied by Benedetto and Li [BL]. <p> Proof. By Corollary 2.2.6, the shifts of form a frame (tight frame) if and only if is a quasi-stable (quasi-orthogonal) generator of S (). Therefore, the theorem follows from the corresponding results in section 2 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. We observe that the above (d) and (e) imply that S contains an orthonormal basis E if and only if S = TT d . That case was termed regular in [BDR1]. <p> Therefore, the theorem follows from the corresponding results in section 2 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. We observe that the above (d) and (e) imply that S contains an orthonormal basis E if and only if S = TT d . That case was termed regular in [BDR1]. Thus (e) above shows that the notions of a stable basis and a frame coincide for a principal shift-invariant E , provided that S () is regular. It is worth mentioning that, in case is compactly supported, S () is always regular. <p> It is worth mentioning that, in case is compactly supported, S () is always regular. The spaces ker T and C T were described explicitly in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> as follows: ker T := fc 2 ` 2 (ZZ d ) : supp bc (TT d nS)g; and hence (2:2:8) C T := fc 2 ` 2 (ZZ d ) : supp bc Sg: Next, we need the following characterization of the Fourier transforms of the elements of S <p> Hence bc is defined by bc = [ b ; b ] and R is given by (2:2:13) c R = b =[ b ; b ]: This representation of R is detailed in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (using a different approach) and is well-known in the special regular case mentioned above (in which a frame becomes a stable basis). The redundancy offered by frames does not really exist for principal shift-invariant ones. <p> The proof can be then completed by a routine argument (cf. e.g., the proof of Theorem 2.16 in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>). The final theorem of this subsection provides the details concerning the dual frame of the above E and a complete description of ker T and C T : Theorem 2.2.16. Let be a countable subset of a PSI space S, E its corresponding shift-invariant set. <p> Frames in FSI spaces In order to lift the results of the previous section from PSI spaces to FSI spaces, we need first the following FSI analog of Result 2.2.9 (cf. Theorem 1.7 in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>): Result 2.3.1. Let be a finite subset of L 2 (IR d ). <p> Prior to proving the lemma, we state our theorem and show how it follows from that lemma. Part (d) of the theorem is due to <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (and was previously proved, under certain decay conditions on , in [JM]). For the special case of quasi-regular FSI spaces (a notion that will be defined in the next subsection), Theorem 2.3.6 in its entirety was already proved in [BDR1] (cf. Corollary 3.30 there. <p> Part (d) of the theorem is due to <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (and was previously proved, under certain decay conditions on , in [JM]). For the special case of quasi-regular FSI spaces (a notion that will be defined in the next subsection), Theorem 2.3.6 in its entirety was already proved in [BDR1] (cf. Corollary 3.30 there. In a quasi-regular FSI space S, + = on S, and hence the [BDR1]-analysis, which is based only on the functions and fl, can still go through). Theorem 2.3.6. <p> This completes the inductive step, thereby the proof of the lemma. Incidentally, the proof of Theorem 2.3.6 shows that every FSI space can be written as a finite orthogonal sum of PSI spaces. This fact was established before in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (cf. Theorem 3.5 there). It leads to the following interesting corollary. Corollary 2.3.8. Given any FSI space S, there exists a finite subset S whose corresponding shift-invariant set E is a tight frame for S. Proof. <p> Frames in quasi-regular FSI spaces We had proved in the last subsection that every FSI space contains a shift-invariant tight frame. However, not every FSI space contains a shift-invariant stable basis. A partial solution to 22 that difficulty was offered in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> via the more general notion of quasi-stable generating sets. That notion was defined in (3.16) of [BDR1], and is closely related to the notion of frames. In fact, Definition 1.3.5 here allows us to rephrase Definition 3.16 of [BDR1] as follows: Definition 2.4.1. <p> However, not every FSI space contains a shift-invariant stable basis.

Let be a finite generating set for the FSI space S. <p> Even with this weakening of the stability notion, <ref> [BDR1] </ref> shows that not every FSI space has a quasi-stable basis (we have proved, in Corollary 2.3.8, that every FSI space has a shift-invariant frame, and even a tight one, therefore, the existence of a quasi-stable basis really relies on the structure of C T ). <p> Spaces that do have quasi-stable bases are termed in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> as quasi-regular. We discuss here several properties of frames in quasi-regular FSI spaces, which may not be valid in more general FSI spaces. One of these is an explicit representation for the orthogonal projector onto S: [BDR1] obtains such formulas for quasi-regular spaces by a Cramer-rule-like expression (see (1.9) there). <p> Spaces that do have quasi-stable bases are termed in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> as quasi-regular.

One of these is an explicit representation for the orthogonal projector onto S: [BDR1] obtains such formulas for quasi-regular spaces by a Cramer-rule-like expression (see (1.9) there). <p> Before we state our first result, we recall the definition of a quasi-basis from <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: The finite is a quasi-basis for the FSI space S if det G is non-zero a.e. on S. We mention, [BDR1], that the existence of a quasi-basis for S is equivalent to the quasi-regularity of S, and that every quasi-stable basis is also a quasi-basis but not vice versa. <p> Before we state our first result, we recall the definition of a quasi-basis from <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: The finite is a quasi-basis for the FSI space S if det G is non-zero a.e. on S. We mention, [BDR1], that the existence of a quasi-basis for S is equivalent to the quasi-regularity of S, and that every quasi-stable basis is also a quasi-basis but not vice versa. The cardinality of the quasi-basis is the length lenS of S and is shown in [BDR1] to depend only on S. <p> We mention, <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, that the existence of a quasi-basis for S is equivalent to the quasi-regularity of S, and that every quasi-stable basis is also a quasi-basis but not vice versa. The cardinality of the quasi-basis is the length lenS of S and is shown in [BDR1] to depend only on S. Proposition 2.4.2. Let be a finite quasi-basis for the (quasi-regular) FSI space S. Assume that E is a Bessel set. Then, (2:4:3) C T = fc = (c ) 2 2 ` 2 (E ) : supp bc Sg: Proof. <p> Since C T is the orthogonal complement of ker T , (2.4.3) would then follow from (i) and (ii) combined. The required (ii) was proved in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: Corollary 3.11 there asserts that, since is a quasi basis, the map ` 2 (E ) 3 c 7! d T c = 2 is 1-1 on C . As for (i), given f 2 S, supp b f lies in the 2-periodic extension (S) ffi of S. <p> Then is a quasi-stable generating set if and only if it is a quasi-basis and its corresponding shifts E form a frame for S. Proof. If E is quasi-stable, then, by definition, it is a frame, and it is also a quasi-basis by virtue of Proposition 3.18 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. Conversely, if is a quasi-basis and E is a frame, then, for the quasi-stability of , it remains to show that C T has the required structure. This follows from Proposition 2.4.2 and the assumption that is a quasi-basis. <p> However, since G (w) is invertible a.e. on S (since is a quasi-basis), it follows that (w) = + (w), a.e. on S, where (w) is the smallest eigenvalue function. Thus fl (w) is essentially bounded above and (w) is bounded below on S. By Corollary 3.30 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, is a quasi-stable generating set. In the rest of the subsection, we consider frame-dual frame representations of the orthogonal projector onto a quasi-regular FSI space S. <p> This, together with (2.4.6), shows that E R is fundamental in S, and hence S (R) = S (). Since is a quasi-basis for S, its cardinality is the length, lenS, of S. Therefore, #(R) # = lenS. However, as asserted by Theorem 3.12 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, every generating set of a quasi-regular FSI space S that contains no more than lenS elements must be a quasi-basis. Theorem 2.4.7. Assume that the shifts E of the finite form a quasi-stable basis for the FSI space S. <p> Instead, we could have solved the equation G d R = b by applying Cramer's rule. That attempt would have resulted in the form for P S that was discussed in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. 3. Infinitely generated SI spaces 3.1. General The study of FSI subspaces of L 2 (IR d ) is pertinent to Approximation Theory, where one attempts to approximate from small, simple spaces of approximants.
