Title: An Integrated Global GIS and Visual Simulation System

Abstract: This paper reports on an integrated visual simulation system supporting visualization of global multiresolution terrain elevation and imagery data, static and dynamic 3D objects with multiple levels of detail, non-protrusive features such as roads and rivers, distributed simulation and real-time sensor input, and an embedded geographic information system. The requirements of real-time rendering, very large datasets, and heterogeneous detail management strongly affect the structure of this system. Use of hierarchical spatial data structures and multiple coordinate systems allow for visualization and manipulation of huge terrain datasets spanning the entire surface of the Earth at resolutions well below one meter. The multi-threaded nature of the system supports multiple windows with independent, stereoscopic views. The system is portable, built on OpenGL, POSIX threads, and X11/Motif windowed interface. It has been tested and evaluated in the field with a variety of terrain data, updates due to real-time sensor input, and display of net-worked DIS simulations.

Reference-contexts: Systems such as VGIS place a high priority on real-time, highly interactive 3D visualizations of the spatial data.

A number of visualization systems have been implemented which integrate 3D visualization techniques with large spatial geographic information and terrain data. Some systems stress accurate rendering of global images, or accurate modeling of environmental processes, often sacrificing interactivity of the system [21, 24]. <p> Hence, we do not require additional compute time to triangulate the height fieldthe different discrete levels of detail of the geometry are rather represented by the pyramidal regular grid structure, and further refinement is employed on-the-fly by the run-time system. See <ref> [20] </ref> for a detailed discussion of the height field level of detail algorithm. <p> As such, it relies heavily on a multithreaded, fine-grained task distribution. Since the display update rate is often of higher importance than the scene update rate, including level of detail selection and animation, more resources are allocated towards satisfying a minimum frame rate. In <ref> [20] </ref>, we propose a terrain geometry level of detail algorithm that generates continuous levels of detail on-the-fly. <p> Hence, the height field LOD algorithm, which is based on vertical error in the triangulation, does not have to be modified significantly to take the curvature of the Earth into account. The delta values (see <ref> [20] </ref>) are however computed in Cartesian rather than geodetic coordinates to avoid over-simplification of flat areas such as oceans. Figure 2 illustrates the local coordinate systems for a few quadrants. labeled axes correspond to the conventional Earth Centered, Earth Fixed Cartesian XYZ global coordinate system. <p> Both of these techniques guarantee to meet an upper bound on the screen space simplification error, and the error bounds can be manipulated interactively by the user until sufficiently high frame rates are obtained. The terrain geometry LOD algorithm is presented in <ref> [20] </ref>, but we will give a brief overview of it here. The algorithm proceeds in two stages; a coarse-grained simplification in which quadnodes are selected at the appropriate resolution, followed by a fine-grained simplification in which individual vertices within each node are decimated.

Reference-contexts: Since there will usually be semantic information such as object type and behavior associated with the clustered objects, the clusters can be evaluated for importance. Stytz et al. <ref> [29] </ref> have shown this is possible using fuzzy logic methods. We are applying and extending these methods to the dynamic clusters within VGIS. The Stytz approach sets static watch areas and evaluates only units that enter these areas whereas our approach handles dynamic clusters wherever they occur.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION This paper reports on significant progress in our efforts to design and construct a real-time visual simulation and geographic information visualization system, named VGIS (Virtual Geographic Information System) <ref> [17, 30] </ref>. VGIS supports the accurate depiction of terrain elevation and imagery, in addition to features such as ground cover and trees, moving vehicles, buildings and other static objects, roads, and atmospheric effects. Thus an entire environment composed of heterogeneous parts must be simulated and integrated at rendering time. <p> Since hundreds to thousands of objects may appear in certain scenarios, the object manager must accept and handle multiple levels of detail. Individual objects will have levels of detail, and there will also be grouping strategies. We have reported previously on hierarchical grouping for sets of moving units <ref> [30] </ref>. In general moving and static objects should be managed differently since they will have different grouping strategies and different ways to handle object detail (e.g. building textures). This is our eventual goal for the object manager.

NASA's Virtual Planetary Exploration project [16] supported virtual exploration of planetary terrains such as Mars at interactive frame rates.
