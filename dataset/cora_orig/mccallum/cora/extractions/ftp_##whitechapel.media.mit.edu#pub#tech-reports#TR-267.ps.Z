Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 267 Appeared in Proc. of the 2 nd IEEE CAD-Based Vision Workshop, Champion, PA, Feb. 1994 (pp. 258-265) Abstract Recently we have proposed a new method for establishing correspondences and computing canonical descriptions [6], based on the idea of describing objects by their generalized symmetries, as defined by the object's vibration or deformation modes. In this paper we extend this method to the problems of object recognition and categorization. Examples of recognizing hand tools and airplanes are shown.

Reference-contexts: In addition, high-frequency eigenvectors can be discarded to obtain overcon-strained, canonical descriptions of the equilibrium solution. Cootes, et al. have also proposed a method for obtaining canonical descriptions. They parameterize a deformable model based on a snake's principal variations over a given training set <ref> [1] </ref>. In the Cootes method, we are limited to measuring only the principal deformations revealed in the training phase, and therefore cannot easily build general models for recognition. 1 Both approaches are limited by the requirement that every object be described as the deformations of a single prototype object.

By describing deformation in terms of the eigenvectors of the prototype object's finite element stiffness matrix, we were able to obtain a robust, frequency-ordered shape description.

Given this equilibrium solution in the two images, point correspondences can be obtained directly. By discarding high frequency modes the amount of compu tation required can be minimized without significantly altering correspondence accuracy. <p> Moreover, such a set of modal amplitudes provide a robust, canonical description of shape in terms of deformations applied to the original elastic body. This allows them to be used directly for object recognition <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 2.3 A New formulation Perhaps the major limitation of previous methods is that the procedure of attaching virtual springs between data points and the surface of the deformable object implicitly imposes a standard parameterization on the data. <p> The resulting matrices are then decomposed into eigenvectors i and eigenvalues ! i as described in <ref> [5; 6] </ref>.The resulting eigenvectors are ordered by increasing eigenvalue, and form the columns of the modal matrix = 1 j : : : j 2m = 6 6 6 4 1 . m 1 . v T 3 7 7 7 ; (9) where m is the number of nodes used

Reference-contexts: This has the effect of implicitly imposing an a priori parameterization upon the sensor data, and therefore implicitly determining the correspondences between data and the prototype. Recently, therefore, we have generalized our finite element formulation so that we can obtain the modal shape invariants directly from the sensor data <ref> [6] </ref>. This has allowed us to both solve correspondence problems and compute robust, canonical descriptions for data of any dimensionality. <p> To accomplish this we use the data itself to define the de-formable object, by building stiffness and mass matrices that use the positions of image feature points as the finite element nodes. In <ref> [6] </ref> we introduced a new finite element formulation which uses Gaussian basis functions as Galerkin interpolants; these inter-polants are used to obtain generalized FEM mass and stiffness matrices. Because of space limitations, we will forego a review of this mathematical formulation; readers are referred to [6].We will, however, review our correspondence <p> The resulting matrices are then decomposed into eigenvectors i and eigenvalues ! i as described in <ref> [5; 6] </ref>.The resulting eigenvectors are ordered by increasing eigenvalue, and form the columns of the modal matrix = 1 j : : : j 2m = 6 6 6 4 1 . m 1 . v T 3 7 7 7 ; (9) where m is the number of nodes used
