Abstract: This report considers the expected combinatorial complexity of the Euclidean Voronoi diagram and the convex hull of sets of n independent random points moving in unit time between two positions drawn independently from the same distribution in R d for for fixed d 2 as n ! 1. It is proved that, when the source and destination distributions are the uniform distribution on the unit d-ball, these complexities are fi(n (d+1)=d ) for the Voronoi diagram and O(n (d1)=(d+1) log n) for the convex hull. Additional results for the convex hull are O(log d n) for the uniform distribution in the unit d-cube and O(log (d+1)=2 n) for the d-dimensional normal distribution.

Reference-contexts: Our results, which may be regarded as generalizations of recent results for the plane derived by Basch et al. <ref> [4] </ref> (although the distributions differ somewhat) can be summarized in the following three theorems: Theorem 1 For any fixed d 2, the expected combinatorial complexity of the Euclidean Voronoi diagram of n random points moving between source and destination chosen from the uniform distribution on the unit d-ball is fi (n

Reference-contexts: If k = m = d and d i = 1 for all i : 1 i k, then K is a d-cube and the bound is O (log d n). This family of distributions has been investigated previously in the context of convex hulls of static point sites <ref> [5] </ref>. Although the particular distributions analyzed here may be unlikely in practice, they are almost certainly more indicative of "typical" complexity than the worst-case bounds.
