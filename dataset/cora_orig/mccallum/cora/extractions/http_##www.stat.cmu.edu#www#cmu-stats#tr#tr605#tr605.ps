Reference-contexts: For condition (b), set &gt; 0 and t 0. Each component of x K (t), being a proportion, is in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, for every K. <p> Since along every convergent subsequence (3.7) and (3.8) are easily seen to converge to the integrands in (3.4) and (3.5), it suffices to show that along every convergent subsequence the sequence n M K converges weakly to the 0 process. A standard martingale central limit theorem, such as <ref> [1] </ref>, theorem 7.1.4, can be used. <p> Jumps of M K are O K so (3.9) follows easily. (3.10) follows by noting that h i ; M K i K for each i; j and t. Thus, by the continous mapping theorem (see, for example <ref> [1] </ref>, Corollary 1.9, p.103), every convergent subsequence of n x K ; y K K=1 , and hence the entire sequence, satisfies the integral equations (3.4) and (3.5), which have a unique solution in for a given initial value since the integrands are Lipschitz continous there.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. In this paper retrials are incorporated into L-symmetric networks and the effect of retrials on network performance is studied for this case. Hunt <ref> [2] </ref> has defined L-symmetric as follows: Definition 1.1. <p> A special case of a 1-symmetric network is the symmetric star network, which has been studied by Whitt [5] and Hunt <ref> [2] </ref> (see also [3] and [6]). An example of a 3-symmetric network is one consisting of two separate symmetric star networks connected by a set of identical links joining the two central hubs. <p> In section 2, a sequence of networks that are L-symmetric is described; notation, due to Hunt <ref> [2] </ref>, used to describe the evolution of calls on the network, plus extra notation for the incorporation of retrials, is introduced. A functional law of large numbers, for fl Queens University, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Kingston, Canada K7L3N6. <p> Blocking and loss probabilities can be obtained by calculating a fixed point of the equations (3.4) and (3.5), and for this purpose the equations (3.5) for y r (t) are more convenient to work with than the explicit solution (3.11). In the next section an example due to Hunt <ref> [2] </ref> with the incorporation of retries is considered in detail. 4. An Example. Consider a 1-symmetric star network with 2 types of calls. Type 1 calls are high priority and require 1 circuit from just 1 link. Type 2 calls require 1 circuit from each of 2 different links. <p> (u) y 1 (u) du; y 2 (t) = y 2 (0) + 0 2 p 12 1 i+j+k&lt;Cs 2 2 1 p 22 1 i+j+k&lt;Cs 2 y 2 (u) du: It may be noted here that the equation for x (t) is exactly the equation obtained by Hunt in <ref> [2] </ref>, except with 1 + 1 y 1 (u) in place of 1 and 2 + 2 y 2 (u) in place of 2 .

Reference-contexts: A special case of a 1-symmetric network is the symmetric star network, which has been studied by Whitt [5] and Hunt [2] (see also <ref> [3] </ref> and [6]). An example of a 3-symmetric network is one consisting of two separate symmetric star networks connected by a set of identical links joining the two central hubs. <p> This is an example of a capacity reservation scheme known as trunk reservation (see <ref> [3] </ref>). The parameter s is a trunk reservation parameter, with s = 0 corresponding to no control being applied. In the notation of section 2, L = 1, C 1 = C and R = 2.

Reference-contexts: In section 4, an example is given illustrating the approximation and a capacity reservation control scheme known as trunk reservation. The following lemma is used to prove relative compactness for the processes of interest in section 3, and is stated without proof. For a proof see <ref> [4] </ref>, chapter 2. Lemma 1.1. Let (E; r) be a complete, separable metric space, where r is the metric, and let fX K g K=1 be a sequence of pure jump processes with sample paths in D E [0; 1). Suppose : 1.
