Reference-contexts: Several articles in the recent past ([5, 4, 3] etc.) have studied the question of optimality of the genetic code. In <ref> [3] </ref> Di Giulio estimated that the natural code has achieved 68% minimization of polarity distance, by comparing the natural code with random block respecting codes (those codes obtained by relabeling the 20 amino acids in the natural table by a permutation thereof). <p> In contrast to the block respecting codes of <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, Goldman [4] considered more general shu*ed codon codes, which maintain the same number of codons per amino acid as in the natural code, but do not require the block structure of the natural code table. <p> Conclusion and further work When iterating 500, 5000 and 5 million steps before changing temperature in M C, we found that the natural code is extremely fault tolerant, in contrast to the results of <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. <p> How does the F T (c) measure using WAC cor respond to the measures mean and M S 0 ? 3. Can one measure the extent to which the natural code is optimized against general (not necessarily block respecting or shu*e codes)? Using Lagrange multipliers Di Giulio <ref> [3] </ref> computed an approximation of 68% optimality for block respecting codes. Unfortunately, the method of [3] changes polarity values to unrealistic values. To rectify this, we plan to apply techniques from constraint programming languages. 4. <p> Can one measure the extent to which the natural code is optimized against general (not necessarily block respecting or shu*e codes)?

Reference-contexts: To what extent is opt a continuous map (i.e. if c c 0 then is opt (c) opt (c 0 ), where one defines an appropriate metric on the space of codes? Is the landscape of codes rugged? In analogy to <ref> [7] </ref>, one can define neutral networks of codes as the set of codes which optimize to the same optimal code. What is the structure of such neutral networks?
