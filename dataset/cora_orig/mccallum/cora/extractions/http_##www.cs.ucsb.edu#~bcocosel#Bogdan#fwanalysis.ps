Abstract: Firewalls are one of the most used security enforcement methods used these days to protect internal company networks from intruders. But can a firewall be "penetrated" or "destroyed" by a sophisticated and/or concentrated attack? In this paper, a general evaluation of the firewall technology will be made (with its strengths and weaknesses) an also a case study over two well-known firewall-protected sites: AT&T Bell Laboratories ( @research.att.com ) and Digital Equipment Corporation ( @dec.com ) will be done. The reliability of firewalls was proved in past few years but, there are still some potential weaknesses of this security technology which can have a dramatic impact on industry in the future. Revealing the risks involved by using firewalls is necessary now, more than ever.

Reference-contexts: This can be achieved by adopting multiple mechanisms that provide backup and redundancy for each other: network security (a firewall), host security (particularly for the bastion host) and human security (user education, careful system administration etc.) <ref> [1] </ref> 1 Check [1] for a excellent evaluation of security strategies 2 For example, if we have a project under development, on which we need the following access rights: the testers should have r-x rights, the developers should have -wx rights, the project manager needs rwx rights. <p> This can be achieved by adopting multiple mechanisms that provide backup and redundancy for each other: network security (a firewall), host security (particularly for the bastion host) and human security (user education, careful system administration etc.) <ref> [1] </ref> 1 Check [1] for a excellent evaluation of security strategies 2 For example, if we have a project under development, on which we need the following access rights: the testers should have r-x rights, the developers should have -wx rights, the project manager needs rwx rights. <p> All other users should be denied access. No matter how we play with the groups and the ownership of the file, the least privilege principle is violated at least once. 3 2.1.3 Bottleneck A Bottleneck (also referred as Choke Point <ref> [1] </ref>) forces attackers to use a narrow channel (which can be thoroughly monitored and controlled), to perform their attack. However, a bottleneck is useless if there is an effective way for an attacker to go around it. <p> Here are some of the security advantages of using firewalls 5 : * Focus for security decisions. All traffic (in and out) must pass through a single, narrow checkpoint. This way, the system administrator can con 5 For an extensive presentation of this issue see <ref> [1] </ref>. A short, but clear image of firewall strengths can be found in [7] 5 centrate the security measures on this point of high traffic. * Enforce security policy. For many companies, a firewall helps enforcing the security policy. <p> Although many firewalls scan all incoming traffic, the scanning is mostly for source and destination and port numbers, not for the details of the data. Detecting a virus in a random packet of data passing through a firewall is very difficult; it requires (see <ref> [1] </ref>): Recognizing that the packet is part of a program Determine what the program should look like Determine that the change is because of a virus * Inherently unsecure services. <p> Besides addressing the security problems involved with this protocol, this paper offer a practical solution of securely "tunneling" X-Windows packets through the gateway 9 An excellent coverage of how to securely configure Internet services, with strengths and weaknesses of each widespreaded protocol is made in <ref> [1] </ref> 7 3.3 Architecture Variations As firewalls are usually a combination of hardware and software with various structures (the actual implementation and enforcement of a firewall remains the decision of the system administrator), many of the firewalls are slight deviation from the standard "accepted" architectures. <p> However, many of this modifications are dangerous and have to be taken into account when designing a new firewall. A more exhaustive analysis of those variations can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 Case Studies Many sites are these days protected by firewalls. However, none of those firewalls are as well-known as those from AT&T Bell laboratories (@research.att.com) or Digital Equipment Corporation (@dec.com).

Reference-contexts: Often, the firewall is installed in order to protect proprietary information as it is the case for AT&T (see [3] and [4]) and DEC (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Even if an employee can disclose sensitive information by carrying offsite a DAT or a floppy disk, the Internet is an immediate threat. Not only that data can be transfered at a high, constant rate to the outside world, but international transfer is also available. <p> No restrictions to incoming data are imposed. 4.2.1 Design The gateway is actually made up of three hosts, acting together as a single system. These systems are referred as Gatekeeper, Gate and Mailgate <ref> [2] </ref>. The first two hosts are on a short network segment that supports the router connecting to the Internet. This is known as the "red" network and considered untrusted.

Reference-contexts: Some institutions opt for convenience and choose a simple router, but this is a dangerous approach <ref> [4] </ref>. Every machine on the internal network can be reached and probed, and, in a complex network, there are many hosts not under the direct supervision of a professional system administrator. Such hosts may carry well-known uncorrected security holes or weak/missing passwords. <p> A new (slower) connection was added to the site which, until protected by the firewall, was a backdoor entrance for the security of the internal network <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 Which is a well known war strategy, as a matter of fact! 4 * Default Permit: That which is not expressly prohibited is permitted Most users and managers prefer the default permit stance. However there are some inherent problems with it. <p> Often, the firewall is installed in order to protect proprietary information as it is the case for AT&T (see [3] and <ref> [4] </ref>) and DEC (see [2]). Even if an employee can disclose sensitive information by carrying offsite a DAT or a floppy disk, the Internet is an immediate threat. Not only that data can be transfered at a high, constant rate to the outside world, but international transfer is also available. <p> Even important, "visible", sites like AT&T have experienced a strange situation like this <ref> [4] </ref>. A special attention must be paid to the so-called indirect connections ie. connections to a site (considered secure) which has an Internet link.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, installing and maintaining a firewall system should be the top priority of any network security design. 2 Firewall Philosophy To simplify the problem, a firewall is a system or group of systems that enforces an access control policy between two networks <ref> [9] </ref> More specifically, a firewall is a collection of components or a system that is placed between two networks and has the following properties: * all traffic from inside to outside, and vice-versa, must pass through it; * only authorized traffic, as defined by the local security policy, is allowed to

Reference-contexts: system that is placed between two networks and has the following properties: * all traffic from inside to outside, and vice-versa, must pass through it; * only authorized traffic, as defined by the local security policy, is allowed to pass through it; * the system itself is immune to penetration <ref> [10] </ref>. In other words, a firewall is a mechanism used to protect a trusted network from an untrusted network. Typically, the two networks in question are an organization's internal network (trusted) and the Internet (untrusted).

Reference-contexts: One of the most mediated attacks which exploited Sendmail's security holes was the Internet Worm <ref> [11] </ref>, a malicious program that spreaded himself across the Internet and whose incredible efficiency in successful attacks gave a great impulse to improve network security in general. There are two common problems with enforcing the least privilege principle.
