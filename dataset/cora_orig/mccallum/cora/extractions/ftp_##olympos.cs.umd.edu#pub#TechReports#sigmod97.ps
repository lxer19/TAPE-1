Abstract: In this paper we consider a very large dataset comprising multiple distinct time sequences. Each point in the sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress such a dataset into a format that supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the data is uncompressed. Experiments on large, real world datasets (AT&T customer calling patterns) show that the proposed method achieves an average of less than 5% error in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5% of the original space (i.e., a 40:1 compression ratio), with these numbers not very sensitive to dataset size. Experiments on aggregate queries achieved a 0.5% reconstruction error with under 2% space requirement.

Reference-contexts: In many practical signals, it is the case that most of the "energy" (or "information") is concentrated in the first few Fourier coefficients [21]. One can then throw away the remaining coefficients. This effect has also been observed in the data mining context <ref> [1] </ref>. The DFT and other associated methods (e.g., DCT, DWT) are all linear transformations, which effectively consider an M -long time sequence as a point in M -d space, and rotate the axes.

Reference-contexts: However, these have only been tried for M =2 dimensions. They will probably suffer in high dimensionalities (e.g., M 100), if they are based on R*-trees [6] or any other related spatial access method [28].

The method is quadratic on the number of records N , and it builds a cluster-hierarchy, which we truncate at the appropriate levels, to obtain the desirable number of clusters.

Reference-contexts: This application of clustering is known in the signal processing literature as vector quantization [16]. Clustering has attracted tremendous interest, from diverse fields and for diverse applications: in information retrieval for grouping together documents represented as vectors [20]; in pattern matching, for grouping together samples of the training set <ref> [3] </ref>; in the social and natural sciences for statistical analysis [9]. Excellent surveys on clustering include [18, 13, 26]. Although useful in numerous applications, in our setting clustering might not scale-up. <p> SVD is a popular and powerful operation, and it has been used in numerous applications, such as statistical analysis (as the driving engine behind the Principal Component Analysis [11]), text retrieval under the name of Latent Semantic Indexing [4], pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction as the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform <ref> [3] </ref>, and face recognition [25]. SVD is particularly useful in settings that involve least-squares optimization such as in linear regression, dimensionality reduction, and matrix approximation. See [24] or [15] for more details.

For stocks prices, which are modeled well as random walks <ref> [21] </ref>, it is believed to be the best among the spectral methods, exactly because successive stock prices are highly correlated. 15 storage space SVD (abs error) SVDD (abs error) SVD (normalized) SVDD (normalized) 5% 1794.917 53.745 465.4% 13.93% 15% 635.456 16.8 164.7% 4.35% 25% 404.824 10.546 104.9% 2.73% Table 3: Worst-case
