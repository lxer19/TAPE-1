Author: Dejan Mircevski, 
Address: Houston, Texas, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, Rice University,  
Abstract: This paper describes an AAL-5 and ATM protocol implementation that allows ATM networks to be used in an internet as Logical IP Subnetworks (LIS). The implemented protocols may be run either on real networking hardware or on a software simulator.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Ethernet protocol identifies hosts by their Ethernet addresses, and the ATM protocol can only deal with virtual connections to certain remote hosts, not the host addresses. For Ethernet and similar data-link-layer protocols, the address resolution is performed using the ARP [8] and InARP <ref> [2] </ref> protocols. For the ATM networks, the recommended protocols are ATMARP and InATMARP [7]. Our system does not, however, use these protocols. AT-MARP is not required for PVC-only ATM networks, and InATMARP is used exactly once, when a host attempts to find its own IP address.

Reference-contexts: This is the responsibility of the ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL-5, <ref> [5] </ref>). AAL-5 performs a reliable, low-overhead transfer of IP packets, with the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of 64KB. The functioning of the AAL-5 is depicted in figure 2. The last ATM cell contains the overhead information: packet size, CRC code, and padding to 48 bytes.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The effort of integrating local-area networks (LAN's) based on the ATM technology into the existing wide-area networks (WAN's) is well under way. Several standardization groups are currently working on specifying the ways in which the TCP/IP protocol stack is to run over ATM networks <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. As always, an effort in defining an emerging standard must be accompanied by an effort in practical implementation of the standard elements. <p> This section describes our design of the protocol stack beneath the TCP/IP. It delineates our solutions to the problems faced by this level, and evaluates their compatibility with the IETF recommendations <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.1 CONVENTIONS The ATM technology is currently in its earliest stage of development. Consequently, the role of an ATM network within a classical IP network is usually the one of a logical subnet. <p> Consequently, the role of an ATM network within a classical IP network is usually the one of a logical subnet. Although the ATM model is much more general and powerful, today it merely replaces the old Ethernet-based LAN technology. As <ref> [7] </ref> points out, the reasons for ATM being confined to traditional IP boundaries stem from the fact that IP is an old and well-established technology, while ATM is not. This paper also treats ATM networks as logical subnets. <p> For Ethernet and similar data-link-layer protocols, the address resolution is performed using the ARP [8] and InARP [2] protocols. For the ATM networks, the recommended protocols are ATMARP and InATMARP <ref> [7] </ref>. Our system does not, however, use these protocols. AT-MARP is not required for PVC-only ATM networks, and InATMARP is used exactly once, when a host attempts to find its own IP address. We decided that this single use does not justify an implementation of a whole protocol. <p> This link is used to connect IP hosts to other IP hosts. A number of hosts connected by such links comprises an ATM network. Such ATM networks are treated by the rest of the internet just like Ethernet networks, as <ref> [7] </ref> requires. It may be noted that we are using hosts to do the ATM switching, instead of dedicated switching elements. This is mandated by the original system's inflexibility: it is impossible for the user to specify which protocols are running on a network routing element.
