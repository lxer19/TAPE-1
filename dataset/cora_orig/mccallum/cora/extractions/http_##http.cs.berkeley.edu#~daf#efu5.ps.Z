Abstract: A recognition strategy consisting of a mixture of indexing on invariants and search, allows objects to be recog-nised up to a Euclidean ambiguity with an uncalibrated camera. The approach works by using projective invariants to determine all the possible projectively equivalent models for a particular imaged object; then a system of global consistency constraints is used to determine which of these projectively equivalent, but Euclidean distinct, models corresponds to the objects viewed. These constraints follow from properties of the imaging geometry. In particular, a recognition hypothesis is equivalent to an assertion about, among other things, viewing conditions and geometric relationships between objects, and these assertions must be consistent for hypotheses to be correct. The approach is demonstrated to work on images of real scenes consisting of polygonal objects and polyhedra. Keywords: Recognition, Computer Vision, Invariant Theory, Indexing, Model-based Vision

One main disadvantage of this approach is that objects are identified only up to either an affine or a projective ambiguity. This paper argues that this ambiguity is a consequence of considering recognition hypotheses in isolation, and is not intrinsic to the approach.

Reference-contexts: Following Hartley <ref> [4] </ref>, we partition P as where t is the focal point (since the focal point projects as PX = 0). Provided the first 3 fi 3 matrix, M, is not singular (i.e. the focal point is not on the plane at infinity), P can always be partitioned in this way.

Indexing using projective invariants (as in <ref> [9] </ref>) associates with each group of image features a collection of object models (labels), which are projectively equivalent, but Euclidean inequivalent. If only one known object is present, the task is possible only if there is just one possible label for that object. <p> ambiguities; for example, a sequence of scaled versions of several different objects will certainly give rise to ambiguities. 2.3 Implementation details and experi ments A system implementing the approach described has been demonstrated on real images of simple scenes, using a stripped-down version of the system described in detail in <ref> [9] </ref> to perform early vision and fitting. Indexing, though performed in a reimplementation of that system, follows essentially the same pattern, but in the present system a successful indexing attempt returns a collection of Euclidean models.

Reference-contexts: It is known that the projective geometry of a range of polyhedra can be recovered partially or completely from a single perspective view with an uncalibrated camera (see <ref> [10, 11] </ref>). In turn, projective invariants coplanar plane objects (five sides), and an unknown object, imaged with a projective camera. 1, superimposed on the backprojected outlines of the objects, which are five-sided plane polygons. <p> However, for most situations, the resulting projective ambiguity is too great. To proceed, it is necessary to assume that that, for each generic view of every polyhedron in the modelbase, a distinctive projective structure can be recovered (details appear in <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> An alternative construction, due to Mohr, is also possible [7]. Labelling an image with a consistent Euclidean labelling proceeds as follows: * Determine a set of projectively equivalent, Euclidean inequivalent labels for each polyhedron visible, using the indexing methods of <ref> [10] </ref>. * For each labelling of each item, compute the focal point and an appropriate cone of rays in the object's frame. * Construct the largest pairwise consistent labelling of the scene, where pairwise consistency is checked by determining that the focal point and cone of rays constructed by assuming one
