Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The FSW1 program enables a user to set up a wide variety of tasks for the CFS-C classifier system <ref> [Riolo, 1988a] </ref>, each modeled as a finite Markov process in which a payoff is associated with some states. The classifier system's input interface provides a message that indicates the current state of the Markov process. <p> This document describes the FSW1 task domain, an example of the domain-dependent part of a classifier system designed to be linked to the CFS-C classifier system <ref> [Riolo, 1988a] </ref>. For general information about the CFS-C package of subroutines which implements the domain-independent parts of a learning classifier system, see the cited documentation.

Reference-contexts: Th CFS-C documention also describes how to design your own task domains for the CFS-C system, and it describes all the commands and features provided by that system. For another example domain, see <ref> [Riolo, 1988b] </ref>. Note well: While I do attempt to keep this document up-to-date, that is note always possible. So if you have any questions or problems, please look at the FSW1 source files for the definitive answers about the version you have.
