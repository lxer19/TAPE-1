Reference-contexts: Experimentation with the use of sound to present data has been underway since the early 1980's, when technology made applied research in this area economical <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the sonifications have often been limited to simple mappings between data values and primitive sound characteristics, such as volume, pitch, and waveshape. In this way it is possible to represent discrete data points as notes.

Reference-contexts: Familiarity with MIDI programming is helpful for reading this section; see <ref> [2] </ref> and [4] for background. Low-level functions to access a serial-to-MIDI interface already exist for the SPARCstation, eliminating the first step in writing a new sound device server. These routines are in the file Shared/MIDIDevice.c, in the directory where you placed the distribution source code.

Reference-contexts: However, like visualization and graphics, sonification and music differ in important ways; sonification idioms are only beginning to emerge. As examples, Scaletti [7], Rabenhorst et al [5], and Francioni <ref> [3] </ref> have begun exploring the use of new idioms and abstractions for mapping data to sound. Scaletti and Craig treat the data set as a stream of audio samples, transforming the new sound created this way, or using it to control other sounds.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, CD quality sound is 44.1K samples per second at 16-bit precision per channel. A better compromise is instruments that conform to the Musical Interface Digital Interface (MIDI) <ref> [4] </ref>. Using a variety of built-in synthesis techniques, most MIDI instruments can play notes in many voices (timbres), ranging from traditional voices like a piano or trumpet to interesting sound effects, such as rush-hour traffic in the city. <p> Familiarity with MIDI programming is helpful for reading this section; see [2] and <ref> [4] </ref> for background.

Reference-contexts: Portability is achieved by separating the sound hardware interface from the sonic "mapping" (i.e., the algorithm that creates sound to display the data). Although this software was written to complement the Pablo performance analysis and visualization environment <ref> [6] </ref>, it is general enough to be used independently by a variety of other applications, or by itself. 3 1 Sun SPARCstation is a trademark of Sun Microsystems Incorporated. 2 In contrast, the Sun SPARCstation plays sampled audio data, which can require a long time to synthesize and a lot of
