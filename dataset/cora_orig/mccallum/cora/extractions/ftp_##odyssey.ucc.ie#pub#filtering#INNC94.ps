Abstract: With the increasing availability of information in electronic form, it becomes more important to have automatic filter methods so that potential recipients are not flooded with irrelevant details. In the following paper we present a design for a system to filter news articles on the Internet. The design consists of a two-layer connectionist model in which both connections and nodes are created dynamically. This model evolves as a user's specific interests evolve, so that it effectively acts as an intelligent user agent for information filtering.

Reference-contexts: Information filtering has been defined as "a name used to describe a variety of processes involving the delivery of information to people who need it" <ref> [Belkin92] </ref>. The problem, however, is reaching alarming proportions for those people utilising perhaps one of the biggest and most far reaching information sources of the current day - the Internet. It has been estimated that traffic on the Internet is growing at a rate of about 9% per month. <p> information retrieval (IR) and information filtering (IF) - for example, the former is generally driven by a specific query while the latter is based on a history of previously identified relevant documents - it has been noted that many techniques of IR can be applied within the domain of IF <ref> [Belkin92] </ref>. One of the primary principles of IR which is relevant here is the word frequency model for indexing articles, based on the observation that "the frequency of word occurrence in an article furnishes a useful measurement of word significance" [Luhn58].

Reference-contexts: To permit people with similar interests to communicate selectively with others around the world, the Usenet newsgroup hierarchy came into being. As successful as the hierarchy model is, it is far from a complete solution. In <ref> [Fischer91] </ref>, the authors describe an empirical study they carried out with a collection of users. Their findings demonstrated that reading just a few newsgroups requires perusing megabytes of information each month. <p> Because of this, readers of newsgroups must locate articles relevant to their interests by "browsing an information space with semantic classifications of different message senders." In this paper, we discuss our design of a model which, in common with <ref> [Fischer91] </ref>, filters incoming articles from a range of newsgroups into a virtual newsgroup containing only those which have been judged to be of a significantly high interest to the user.

Reference-contexts: Then (i) the very low frequency words can be excluded as being not much on the writer's mind and (ii) the very high frequency words can be discarded on the grounds that they are almost always insignificant <ref> [Forsyth86] </ref>. Although simplistic, this work led to the birth of a large collection of IR approaches based on applying statistical modelling techniques to textual documents. One such approach is the vector space model, of which the SMART system [Salton83 (a)] is perhaps one of the most famous representatives.

Reference-contexts: To attempt to capture and integrate this information, we looked to the works and theories of some of the leading exponents of what have come to be known as dynamic or episodic memory architectures. 2.2 Episodic Memory In <ref> [Kolodner84] </ref>, Kolodner explains episodic mem ory as follows: "The episodic view of memory claims that memory is organised around personal experiences or episodes, and not around abstract semantic categories.

Reference-contexts: One of the primary principles of IR which is relevant here is the word frequency model for indexing articles, based on the observation that "the frequency of word occurrence in an article furnishes a useful measurement of word significance" <ref> [Luhn58] </ref>. The reasoning here is based on the fact that writers tend to repeat certain words as they advance and elaborate their argument on some subject. <p> F = 3 if both frequencies are between the two cut-off points <ref> [Luhn58] </ref>; ii. F = 2 if only one of the frequencies is between the limits; iii. F = 1 if they are both outside the limits. Finally, when all the contributions have been calculated, they are normalised so that they will all add up to 100.

Reference-contexts: In effect, we shall build a user profile based on a history of those articles previously deemed to be interesting by a user. This profile will then act as an intelligent user agent <ref> [Maes94] </ref> for the filtering of subsequent articles, while adapting to user feedback regarding its success in filtering those articles. 2.

Reference-contexts: All in all, about 5 - 10 variables exist which need to be pre-set by the programmer. The effect of these variables manifests itself in the recall and precision (see <ref> [Malone90] </ref> for a good description of these terms) of the model - basically how specific or general it is going to be. Ideally, each user could set these parameters in accordance with their needs but, clearly, this would require expert knowledge on the part of the user.

Reference-contexts: These scripts are then analysed for reliability and the best serve to guide the model during the filtering stage in selecting those articles which compare favour-ably to our experience gathered in the learning phase. 2.2.2 Minds and Minsky In "The Society Of Mind" <ref> [Minsky87] </ref>, Minsky proposed that the mind was a vast society of interacting agents which co-operated and competed with each other to produce intelligent behaviour. To co-ordinate these agents, he put forward a scheme not altogether different from the way events are organised by Schank's scripts.

Reference-contexts: Before we discuss this architecture, two key concepts need to be introduced - scripts and K-lines. 2.2.1 Schank's Scripts Schank describes a script as a "standard event sequence" <ref> [Schank77] </ref>. He argues that each one of us possesses a multitude of scripts 'inside our heads', so to speak, which guide us in our actions in stereotypical situations. These scripts are said to form from repeated occurrences of events during a given scenario.
Reference: [Schank82] <author> Schank, R., </author> <title> Dynamic Memory, </title> <publisher> Cambridge Univ. Press, </publisher> <year> 1982. </year>
Reference-contexts: When we are faced with a typical everyday situation we simply follow a script that has formed in our head from previous repeated dealings with this situation. When following a script, and something occurs which was not accounted for in the script, an "expectation failure" <ref> [Schank82] </ref> occurs. <p> In other words, more often than not, if we come across C, we should expect to find D following it as the next event. If, instead, we come across F then we find that this possibility was already there as an "expectation failure" <ref> [Schank82] </ref> and are 'reminded' of this previous episode. In the reminding process the link between C and F becomes stronger (to the detriment of that between C and D).
