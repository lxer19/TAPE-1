Title: Word-Sense Disambiguation Using Decomposable Models  
Author: Rebecca Bruce and Janyce Wiebe

Abstract: Most probabilistic classifiers used for word-sense disambiguation have either been based on only one contextual feature or have used a model that is simply assumed to characterize the interdependencies among multiple contextual features. In this paper, a different approach to formulating a probabilistic model is presented along with a case study of the performance of models produced in this manner for the disambiguation of the noun interest. We describe a method for formulating probabilistic models that use multiple contextual features for word-sense disambiguation, without requiring untested assumptions regarding the form of the model. Using this approach, the joint distribution of all variables is described by only the most systematic variable interactions, thereby limiting the number of parameters to be estimated, supporting computational efficiency, and providing an understanding of the data.

Reference-contexts: In the furture, we will investigate other goodness-of-fit tests ([18], <ref> [1] </ref>, [22]) that are perhaps more appropriate for sparse data. The Experiment Unlike several previous approaches to word sense disambiguation ([29], [5], [7], [10]), nothing in this approach limits the selection of sense tags to a particular number or type of meaning distinctions.

Reference-contexts: The worse the fit, the more informative the feature is judged to be (similar to the approach suggested in <ref> [9] </ref>). Only features whose values can be automatically determined were considered, and preference was given to features that intuitively are not specific to interest (but see the discussion of collocational features below).
