(This is true even for logspace-uniformity, since it follows from <ref> [BCH86] </ref> and [RT92] that division can be done in uniform TC 0 if the number N is given, where N is the product of the first n 2 primes.

The strategy of <ref> [CRS93] </ref> is to use probabilistic bits to define a way of assigning a "weight" to each set A 2 F so that if F is not empty, then with high probability there is a unique element of F having minimum weight. The next paragraph explains how this is done. <p> Finally, define w i to be equal to P t1 j=0 b i;j r j . The weight of a set A k is then P i2A k w i . By Proposition 2 of <ref> [CRS93] </ref>, if F is not empty, then there is a unique minimal weight set in F . This paragraph explains how to implement this system as a constant-depth circuit.

More specifically, f is logspace many-one reducible to the determinant 3 iff it is the difference of two #L functions (see <ref> [Vi91a, Da91, To91a] </ref>; an essentially equivalent result is also proved in [Va92, Theorem 2]).

For example, there is an explicit construction in [BT91] of a polynomial P k of degree 2k 1 such that P k (y) mod 2 k = y mod 2. (A nice alternative construction is presented in <ref> [Ko94] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: Motivated by this question, <ref> [Ko90] </ref> and [Ni91] showed that commutativity is crucial for the results of [VSBR83, MRK88]. <p> Motivated by this question, [Ko90] and [Ni91] showed that commutativity is crucial for the results of [VSBR83, MRK88]. Namely, it was shown in <ref> [Ko90, Theorem 1] </ref> that for the particular semiring of 2 fl with fi denoting concatenation and + denoting union, there is a circuit with linear size and degree that is not equivalent to any circuit with sublinear depth. An essentially equivalent example is presented in [Ni91, Theorem 4]. <p> We investigate below the extent to which OptLOGCFL itself can be characterized in terms of circuits of small depth. No parallel algorithm for OptLOGCFL is presented in [Vi91a], and in fact this is explicitly listed as an open problem there; instead, attention is drawn to the negative results of <ref> [Ni91, Ko90] </ref> showing that depth reduction is not possible in general for non-commutative semirings. 5.2 Depth Reduction for (max,concat) Circuits In this section we show that (max,concat) circuits of polynomial size and degree can be simulated by (max,concat) circuits of polynomial size and logarithmic depth, when unbounded fanin gates are allowed. <p> In the non-commutative case, we know of one semi-ring where this holds (the (max,concat) circuits, described in Section 5), and another where it does not (the (union, concat) circuit lower bounds from <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref>). Where exactly does the proof of Theorem 3.1 break down in this setting? Let us say that a circuit is "right-lopsided" if at each fi gate, the degree of the left child does not exceed the degree of the right child. <p> Polynomial size circuits of polynomial degree, with short-right-paths. 3. Polynomial size semi-unbounded circuits of logarithmic depth. In particular, for left-skew or right-skew circuits, depth reduction is always possible. This cannot be extended to skew circuits, since the linear depth lower bound given by <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref> is for a function with skew circuits. 6.2 The Generalized LOGCFL model In the case of the Boolean ring and computation over integers, we know the relationship between SAC 1 circuits and LOGCFL machines (AuxPDAs) [Ve91, Vi91]. <p> This result cannot be further improved to circuits which have linear intertwining but sub linear depth, because, referring back to the function cited in <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref>, the corresponding skew circuit has O (n) intertwining depth. 6.4 A New Optimization Class and its Circuit Characterization Consider a restricted version of OptLOGCFL, where the underlying AuxPDA transducer's pushdown height is bounded by O (log n). (Recall that each stack symbol is assumed to be O (log n) <p> The reason we are interested in (union,concat) generators is that the only explicit depth lower bounds known for non-commutative computation have been shown for such generators <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref>. In particular, in [Ko90] and [Ni91] it is shown that the language L 1 = fww R jw 2 f0; 1g fl g has no sub-linear-depth generator of any size. <p> The reason we are interested in (union,concat) generators is that the only explicit depth lower bounds known for non-commutative computation have been shown for such generators [Ko90, Ni91].

Reference-contexts: The results of [VSBR83] were extended in <ref> [MRK88] </ref> by providing fast parallel algorithms for evaluating arithmetic circuits. However, these algorithms involve a component that is hard for NLOG, so no logspace uniform construction was known. One of the first uniform depth reductions was shown in [Ve91] (improving [Ru81]) for the Boolean ring. <p> what can be viewed as essentially a degree-reduction result: every function in AC 1 can be reduced to a function computed by a polynomial size arithmetic circuit of degree n O (log log n) over the natural numbers, improving the trivial degree upper bound of n O (log n) . <ref> [MRK88] </ref> also raised the question of whether analogous results could be proved in the presence of non-commutative multiplication.

In <ref> [Ni91] </ref>, Nisan shows lower bounds on the size of left-skew circuits generating certain languages. (The lower bounds are proved for size of Algebraic Branching Programs; it is easy to see that these programs correspond exactly to left-skew circuits.) He further shows that if a set is hard to generate in left-skew <p> We investigate below the extent to which OptLOGCFL itself can be characterized in terms of circuits of small depth. No parallel algorithm for OptLOGCFL is presented in [Vi91a], and in fact this is explicitly listed as an open problem there; instead, attention is drawn to the negative results of <ref> [Ni91, Ko90] </ref> showing that depth reduction is not possible in general for non-commutative semirings. 5.2 Depth Reduction for (max,concat) Circuits In this section we show that (max,concat) circuits of polynomial size and degree can be simulated by (max,concat) circuits of polynomial size and logarithmic depth, when unbounded fanin gates are allowed. <p> In the non-commutative case, we know of one semi-ring where this holds (the (max,concat) circuits, described in Section 5), and another where it does not (the (union, concat) circuit lower bounds from <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref>). Where exactly does the proof of Theorem 3.1 break down in this setting? Let us say that a circuit is "right-lopsided" if at each fi gate, the degree of the left child does not exceed the degree of the right child. <p> Polynomial size circuits of polynomial degree, with short-right-paths. 3. Polynomial size semi-unbounded circuits of logarithmic depth. In particular, for left-skew or right-skew circuits, depth reduction is always possible. This cannot be extended to skew circuits, since the linear depth lower bound given by <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref> is for a function with skew circuits. 6.2 The Generalized LOGCFL model In the case of the Boolean ring and computation over integers, we know the relationship between SAC 1 circuits and LOGCFL machines (AuxPDAs) [Ve91, Vi91]. <p> This result cannot be further improved to circuits which have linear intertwining but sub linear depth, because, referring back to the function cited in <ref> [Ko90, Ni91] </ref>, the corresponding skew circuit has O (n) intertwining depth. 6.4 A New Optimization Class and its Circuit Characterization Consider a restricted version of OptLOGCFL, where the underlying AuxPDA transducer's pushdown height is bounded by O (log n).

Let us denote this by (u; v) = m. The results in this section extend Nisan's results on non-commutative computation <ref> [Ni91] </ref>, and thus it is necessary to express his framework using the circuit models we have used thus far in this paper. Nisan's work is motivated by the desire to understand the extent to which efficient computation of the permanent and determinant rely on commutativity. <p> Thus all coefficients in f L are 0 or 1 (; or feg). Now we follow notation and definitions from <ref> [Ni91] </ref>. Definition 7.5 ([Ni91]) An Algebraic Branching Program (ABP) is a directed acyclic graph with one source and one sink. <p> Matrix M k; (f ) has rows indexed by monomials of degree k, and columns indexed by monomials of degree n k. The entry at hu; vi is the coefficient of the monomial (u; v) in f . The following lemma is an easy extension of Theorem 1 from <ref> [Ni91] </ref>. Lemma 7.6 The size of the smallest -clone-skew circuit generating L unambiguously is exactly d k=0 rank (M k; (f L )). It is worthwhile observing that we can strengthen Lemma 7.6 slightly by deleting the word "unambiguously". <p> Theorem 7.8 The class of languages generated unambiguously by left-skew circuits is strictly contained in the class of languages generated unambiguously by clone-skew circuits. Proof: Consider the language L 1 = n o . In <ref> [Ni91, Theorem 4.2] </ref> it is shown that any left-skew circuit generating this language unambiguously must have exponential - 44 - size. <p> For instance, let L 3 be the Dyck language of balanced parentheses, where 0 (1) is interpreted as an opening (closing) parenthesis. This set is easily seen to be in 1-DLOG, and thus has polynomial-size unambiguous left-skew circuits. Lemma 2 of <ref> [Ni91] </ref> indicates that computing the permanent or determinant in a noncommutative setting via left-skew circuits requires at least exponential size. We show that this lower bound holds even if arbitrary skew circuits are allowed. <p> Proof: Consider any skew circuit computing the permanent. By treating the gates as commutative gates, the circuit can trivially be converted into a left-skew circuit of the same size. The function computed by such a circuit is clearly weakly equivalent to the permanent. By Theorem 2 of <ref> [Ni91] </ref>, any function weakly equivalent to the permanent has exponential size.

One popular model (for instance, the model studied in <ref> [VSBR83] </ref>) allows a circuit with n input variables to compute a function defined on S n ; that is, an input variable can be assigned the value of any element from the semiring; and thus a single circuit may compute a function on an infinite domain. <p> For the original definitions of "surface configuration" and "realizable pair," see [Co71].

To extend the analogy to the general setting, we consider a generalized definition of LOGCFL machines. <p> Thus effectively the stack holds O (log 2 n) bits.) We denote this class by R-OptLOGCFL. If we consider the Boolean or counting versions of LOGCFL, then restricting the pushdown to logarithmic depth does not make the class any weaker; see <ref> [Vi91, Lemma 3.1] </ref>. However for the optimizing functions it may make a difference. - 35 - From the resource bounds on the transducers computing these optimizing functions, it is clear that OptL R-OptLOGCFL OptLOGCFL.

Reference-contexts: It is known that the complexity of the determinant is roughly determined by #L. More specifically, f is logspace many-one reducible to the determinant 3 iff it is the difference of two #L functions (see <ref> [Vi91a, Da91, To91a] </ref>; an essentially equivalent result is also proved in [Va92, Theorem 2]). Also, this class of functions is precisely the class computed by polynomial-size skew arithmetic circuits over the integers [To92]. For additional related results, see [AO94]. <p> In [Vi91] it was claimed that OptLOGCFL coincides with OptSAC 1 , but this claim was later retracted <ref> [Vi91a] </ref>. Instead, the following is easy to show (using the techniques of e.g., [Vi91, Ve91]): - 17 - Proposition 5.2 OptLOGCFL is the class of functions computed by uniform families of arithmetic circuits of polynomial degree over ( fl ; max,concat). <p> Thus the entire running time is polynomial. Since OptSAC 1 has polynomial degree, it is contained in OptLOGCFL. We investigate below the extent to which OptLOGCFL itself can be characterized in terms of circuits of small depth. No parallel algorithm for OptLOGCFL is presented in <ref> [Vi91a] </ref>, and in fact this is explicitly listed as an open problem there; instead, attention is drawn to the negative results of [Ni91, Ko90] showing that depth reduction is not possible in general for non-commutative semirings. 5.2 Depth Reduction for (max,concat) Circuits In this section we show that (max,concat) circuits of
