Abstract: We present an expanded mixed finite element approximation of second order elliptic problems containing a tensor coefficient. The mixed method is expanded in the sense that three variables are explicitly approximated, namely, the scalar unknown, the negative of its gradient, and its flux (the tensor coefficient times the negative gradient). The resulting linear system is a saddle point problem. In the case of the lowest order Raviart-Thomas elements on rectangular parallelepipeds, we approximate this expanded mixed method by incorporating certain quadrature rules. This enables us to write the system as a simple, cell-centered finite difference method, requiring the solution of a sparse, positive semidefinite linear system for the scalar unknown. For a general tensor coefficient, the sparsity pattern for the scalar unknown is a nine point stencil in two dimensions, and 19 points in three dimensions. Existing theory shows that the expanded mixed method gives optimal order approximations in the L 2 and H s -norms (and superconvergence is obtained between the L 2 -projection of the scalar variable and its approximation). We show that these rates of convergence are retained for the finite difference method. If h denotes the maximal mesh spacing, then the optimal rate is O(h). The superconvergence rate O(h 2 ) is obtained for the scalar unknown and rate O(h 3=2 ) for its gradient and flux in certain discrete norms; moreover, the full O(h 2 ) is obtained in the strict interior of the domain. Computational results illustrate these theoretical results. 1. Introduction. We consider mixed finite element approximations of second

The difference is that in [29] the TM rule for the last integral in (4.1c); whereas, here we use the trapezoidal rule to maintain symmetry in the case that K is not diagonal. If a uniform mesh and a constant K are used, we obtain a standard finite difference procedure.

Reference-contexts: Many other O (h 2 ) finite difference schemes can be constructed that vary mainly in how K is treated and the second order derivatives are approximated (see standard texts of finite difference methods, e.g., <ref> [31] </ref> or [24]). We show in the next section that our scheme has global convergence properties. Moreover, it is symmetric and locally conservative, and it has a compact 9 or 19 point stencil and connections to mixed finite element methods.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, Russell and Wheeler showed that in fact their quadrature rules turned the mixed method into a cell-centered finite difference scheme with a five point stencil (or "computational molecule") if d = 2, or seven if d = 3. Weiser and Wheeler <ref> [32] </ref> showed that the modified scheme converges at the rate of the unmodified scheme. This is true also of the superconvergence that is obtained for the velocity u and pressure p in certain discrete norms [25], [16], [17], [19]. <p> If the grids are generated by a C 2 map, then r = 2 for points strictly in the interior of that lie on an edge or face e such that e " D = ;.

A similar formulation was considered by Chen [11] to approximate a nonlinear problem, using only the BDM spaces [9].
