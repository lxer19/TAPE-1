Title: McColm's Conjecture  
Author: Yuri Gurevich Neil Immerman Saharon Shelah 
Date: LICS (1994), 10-19  
Affiliation: U of Michigan U of Massachusetts Hebrew U and Rutgers  
Abstract: Gregory McColm conjectured that positive elementary inductions are bounded in a class K of finite structures if every (FO + LFP) formula is equivalent to a first-order formula in K. Here (FO + LFP) is the extension of first-order logic with the least fixed point operator. We disprove the conjecture. Our main results are two model-theoretic constructions, one deterministic and the other randomized, each of which refutes McColm's conjecture.

Reference-contexts: Recall that (FO + ITER), is first-order logic plus an unbounded iteration operator (equivalent to the "while", and "partial fixed point" operators). It is known that the language (FO + ITER) captures PSPACE on ordered structures [I82, V]. Abiteboul and Vianu <ref> [AV] </ref> showed that P = PSPACE if and only if, (FO + LFP) = (FO + ITER) on all sets of finite structures.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, S is still not recognizable in FO over C. 2 One special case of McColm's conjecture remains open. This is a fascinating question in complexity the ory and logic related to uniformity of circuits and log ical descriptions, cf. <ref> [BIS] </ref>. Consider the structures B = fB 1 ; B 2 ; : : :g where B i = hf0; 1; : : : ; i 1g; ; BITi. <p> Equivalently, the answer to Question 3.15 is "Yes," iff deterministic log--time uniform AC 0 is equal to polynomial-time uniform AC 0 , cf. <ref> [BIS] </ref>. A resolution of this question would thus answer an important question in complexity theory. 4 The Randomized Construction We now sketch a quite different construction that also disproves McColm's conjecture. Throughout this construction, P is a binary predicate.

Reference-contexts: This in turn depends on the fact that L ! 1;! on unordered structures is not expressive enough to count. In <ref> [CFI] </ref> a lower bound was proved on the language (FO + COUNT + LFP). This is a language over two-sorted structures: one sort is the numbers: f0; 1; : : : ; n1g equipped with the usual ordering. <p> The least fixed point operator may be applied to relations over a combination of number and vertex variables. Define the language (L + COUNT) ! 1;! to be the superset of (FO + COUNT + LFP) obtained by adding counting quantifiers to L ! 1;! . In <ref> [CFI] </ref> it is shown that the language (FO + COUNT+LFP) and in fact even (L+COUNT) ! 1;! - does not express all polynomial-time properties, even over structures of color class size four. <p> Such structures are "almost ordered": they consist of an ordered set of n=4 color classes, each of size four. Only the vertices inside these color classes are not ordered. We glean the following fact from <ref> [CFI] </ref>. Fact 3.11 ([CFI]) For each n &gt; 0 there exist noni- somorphic graphs T n and f T n each with O (n) vertices, such that T n and f T n are indistinguishable by all formulas with at most n variables from (FO + LFP + COUNT), or even
