Title: BUFFER REQUIREMENTS IN ATM NETWORKS WITH LEAKY BUCKETS  
Author: Ljiljana Trajkovic and Shlomo Halfin

Abstract: For an ATM network with guaranteed Quality of Service, we present traffic scenarios showing that the buffer size allocation requirements at various hops through the network may grow unexpectedly high for a zero loss Quality of Service. This occurs even if one uses Peak Load Allocation and the traffic patterns entering the network are well regulated and conform to the agreed rates.

Reference-contexts: Interleaving fast and slow cells in the MUXing points would prevent clustering of fast cells. This, in turn, will alleviate the need for buffering the fast cells in the DMUX network pints. One way to implement such interleaving would be a Weighted Fair Queueing <ref> [2] </ref> of cells belonging to VCs of different bandwidths. F L 1 L 2 B 2 14.976 x 5 = Multiple 74.88 Mb/s 14.976 x 5 = A 2 74.88 Mb/s Multiple 74.88 Mb/s A and B arrive to MUX points and travel through links of ATM bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: The sources on the outskirts of the network have shaped traffic patterns with parameters that conform to a leaky bucket <ref> [13] </ref> traffic control scheme. We show that the buffer size allocation requirements at various hops through the network may grow unexpectedly high for a zero loss QoS even if the traffic entering the network is well regulated and conforms to the agreed rates.
