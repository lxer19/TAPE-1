Abstract: Over the past several years, a number of wide-area information navigation and discovery tools have been introduced, including WAIS[1], Gopher[2], World-Wide Web[3], etc. In this paper, we describe a graphical query interface to remote bibliographic databases that can be found on the internet. A library query client, called LibSearch, has been designed and implemented using a set of APIs based on Z39.50 protocol standard[4]. Z39.50 is an application-layer protocol within the OSI reference model designed to allow library users to remotely access the bibliographic records in the library systems. As increasing number of OPAC systems are being established as Z39.50 servers on the internet, Libsearch provides a user-friendly environment to specify search requests and retrieve bibliographic information from these servers. LibSearch supports: (1) the use of window icons to enable users to easily carry out their search activities, (2) remote accesses to diverse library catalogue systems through a simple and uniform interface, (3) the browsing of search results and storing them in files, and (4) simple user customization.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The advances in wide-area information sharing and access in recent years have resulted in a variety of public accessible information servers, such as WAIS <ref> [1] </ref>, Gopher [2] and World-Wide Web [3]. By storing information on these servers, information owners provide an easily means for anyone to access the information. Most of these popular servers are set up as independent processes and they support the construction of new and general information sources.

Reference-contexts: For example, RDA (Remote Data Access)[5] is a protocol standard designed to allow internet access to databases, and Z39.50 <ref> [4] </ref> is another protocol standard for remote bibliographic information retrievals. The major architectural difference between servers operating on a pre-existing information sources and servers operating on a newly setup information sources is illustrated by Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The development and improvement of LibSearch are included as parts of a larger digital library project known as Harp <ref> [7] </ref>. 1.1 Related work In this section, we summarize some ongoing work in building a user-friendly remote client to pre-existing library OPAC systems.

Reference-contexts: Readers can refer to [13] for frontends designed to visualize and query remote document servers. A Z39.50 client called DRA Find has been developed by the DRA organization <ref> [8] </ref>. Like LibSearch, it runs on in the PC windows environment. On one hand, DRA Find demonstrates some interesting features such as annotating the returned search bibliographic records with appropriate icons representing different record types e.g. books, technical reports, video tapes, etc.

Reference-contexts: The searches that can be specified are also limited. Being a propriety software, the DRA Find's APIs to use Z39.50 services are not available for future research prototyping effort. Willow is an information retrieval tool developed at the University of Washington <ref> [9] </ref>. It also provides a single, easy-to-use graphical user interface to Z39.50 compliant bibliographic database systems. On the whole, the functionality provided by Willow is similar to that of LibSearch except that the former only operates in the Unix X Window environment.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, servers can be removed from the list. To further ensure that users are well assisted during the search activities, LibSearch provides a comprehensive help window as shown in Figure 10. The help messages are organized in a document with hyperlinks <ref> [12] </ref>. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a user-friendly frontend to remote library OPACs based on the Z39.50 protocol. This prototype frontend, known as LibSearch, consists of a client driver and a user interface layer.
