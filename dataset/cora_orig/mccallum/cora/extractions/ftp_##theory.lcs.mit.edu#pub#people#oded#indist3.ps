Abstract: We consider the existence of pairs of probability ensembles which may be efficiently distinguished given k samples but cannot be efficiently distinguished given k 0 &lt; k samples. It is well known that in any such pair of ensembles it cannot be that both are efficiently computable (and that such phenomena cannot exist for non-uniform classes of distinguishers, say, polynomial-size circuits). It was also known that there exist pairs of ensembles which may be efficiently distinguished based on two samples but cannot be efficiently distinguished based on a single sample. In contrast, it was not known whether the distinguishing power increases when one moves from two samples to polynomially-many samples. We show the existence of pairs of ensembles which may be efficiently distinguished given k+1 samples but cannot be efficiently distinguished given k samples, where k can be any function bounded above by a polynomial in the security parameter. In course of establishing the above result, we prove several technical lemmas regarding polynomials and graphs. We believe that these may be of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding (to the length function `) uniform ensemble, denoted U = fU n g n2N , has each U n uniformly distributed over f0; 1g `(n) . A function, : N 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is called negligible if for every positive polynomial p and all 1 sufficiently large n's, (n) &lt; 1=p (n). <p> A "strong" negation of the notion of indistinguishability is presented by the notion of distinguishability. A function, : N 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is called noticeable if there exists a positive polynomial p so that for all sufficiently large n's, (n) &gt; 1=p (n). <p> We stress that the two notions do not complement one another, but rather leave a gap in-between, since the underlying notions of negligible and noticeable are not complementary. Clearly, a negligible function is not noticeable, but there are functions : N 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> which are neither negligible nor noticeable (e.g., (n) = 1 if n is even and 0 otherwise). Definition 2.2 (distinguishability by k samples): Let k : N 7! N, P = fP n g n2N and Q = fQ n g n2N be as in Definition 2.1 above. <p> Motivating Discussion.

For every finite field F and every k &lt; p jFj=10 there exists a (polynomial-time computable) function f : (F k ) 2 7! [0; 1] so that no degree k 1 polynomial is (f; k; 0:4)-typical. (See Proposition 3.5.) Using the above, Theorem 2.3 is proven by standard diagonalization. The high level plan is as follows. <p> For details see Section 3.4. 3.2 Almost all degree k polynomials are k-typical The most involved technical part of this work is proving that for any f : (F k ) 2 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> most degree k polynomials are (f; k; jFj (1) )-typical. That is, Lemma 3.2 There exists a constant c &gt; 0 so that for every f : (F k ) 2 7!

Lemma 3.3 Let f : (F k ) 2 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and def = E x;y2F k (f (x; y)). <p> In showing the latter we will use the fact that the x 's are "almost pairwise independent" (as in <ref> [1, Sec. 4.3] </ref>). <p> For such a random polynomial, p, the sequence p (x 1 ); :::; p (x k ); p (y 1 ); :::; p (y k ) is uniformly distributed over F 2k .)

We claim that for any f : (F k ) 2 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, for almost all p 2 F k the average of f over the neighbors of p approximates the average of f over all (F k ) 2 . 2. <p> Lemma 4.2 [12]: Suppose that a regular bipartite graph with edge set E U fi V is an (*; ffi)- extractor.

This, however, contradicts our setting of * = 1=3 .
