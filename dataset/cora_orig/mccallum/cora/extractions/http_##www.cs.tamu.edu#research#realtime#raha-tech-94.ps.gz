Abstract: In this paper we study the effect of the output link scheduling discipline of an ATM switch on the ability of an ATM LAN to admit real-time connections. Three output link scheduling policies are studied: First Come First Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), and Packet-by-packet Generalized Processor Sharing (PGPS). We derive connection admission criteria for the three scheduling policies. To evaluate the performance of the three scheduling policies, we introduce the metric of admission probability. The admission probability gives the probability that a randomly chosen set of real-time connections will be admitted into the network. The admission probability allows system designers to study the performance of different scheduling policies over a wide range of network loads. We observe that the performance of the three scheduling policies is sensitive to message deadlines. When the deadlines are small, PGPS outperforms both RR and FCFS, and RR outperforms FCFS. When the deadlines are large, all three scheduling policies perform the same. We also note that although PGPS is better than RR and FCFS most of the time, its improved performance is achieved at the cost of high implementation complexity and run time overheads.

The principle advantages of FCFS are its simple implementation and its low run time overheads. The main shortcoming of FCFS is its inability to provide isolation between connections <ref> [4] </ref>. The lack of isolation means that the worst case delay experienced by the connections being served by a FCFS scheduler is the same for all connections. Thus, in the worst case, short messages have to wait a longer time relative to their length than do long messages.

Reference-contexts: Class A traffic in ATM is given a guaranteed share of the bandwidth and its maximum delay is guaranteed not to exceed a given bound. ATM is a connection oriented technology, requiring a connection setup phase before a new connection is admitted to the network <ref> [5] </ref>. During connection setup, an admission control policy is invoked. The admission control policy will admit the new connection only if the quality of service (QOS), e.g., delay bounds, desired by the new connection can be met without violating any of the QOS guarantees given to the already established connections.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to FCFS, RR is not biased against short messages, and provides a certain isolation for each connection. Furthermore, RR results in a smaller average delay as compared to FCFS. RR can be implemented with low run time overheads <ref> [11] </ref>, although it has a higher complexity than that required for FCFS. RR scheduling has been analyzed in [18, 21], which give probabilistic bounds on the average waiting time of a message.

The methodology developed in this paper can also be extended to other scheduling policies. <p> Before proceeding, we need to introduce some notation. An interval of time for which the server is busy is defined as busy interval. Let the maximum possible length of a busy interval be denoted by B. The following lemma, which follows from work in <ref> [15] </ref>, gives an upper bound on the length of a busy interval (see Appendix A for an alternative proof to this lemma). <p> From Theorem 2, an admission criterion for RR can be given as, for 1 i N , d max where d max i is calculated from (16). 4.3 Packet-by-packet Generalized Processor Sharing Packet-by-packet Generalized Processor Sharing (PGPS) is an approximation of Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS). In GPS <ref> [15] </ref>, a scheduler serving N connections is characterized by a set of weights 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; N . The weights are positive real numbers. <p> This enables GPS to provide a higher degree of isolation to each connection as compared to FCFS and RR. In practice, GPS cannot be implemented because of its fluid traffic model and because of its assumption that messages from different connections can be transmitted simultaneously. Parekh <ref> [15] </ref> has developed a packet based approximation to GPS, known as Packet-by-packet GPS, or PGPS, which works as follows. When choosing a packet to send, PGPS sends the packet that would be the next packet to finish its transmission if GPS were being used and no new packets arrive. <p> When choosing a packet to send, PGPS sends the packet that would be the next packet to finish its transmission if GPS were being used and no new packets arrive. PGPS must timestamp every new message and maintain a sorted queue of the messages at the output link <ref> [15] </ref>. Thus, the run time overhead of PGPS is significantly higher than that for FCFS or RR. In our study, we consider an idealized implementation of PGPS with no run time overhead. <p> Thus, we set the weight i associated with connection M i as i = min (D i ;P i ) i=1 min (D i ;P i ) The behavior of GPS when used for network scheduling has been studied extensively by Parekh <ref> [15] </ref>. In his analysis, the input traffic from a connection M i to the switch is assumed to be constrained by a leaky bucket with bucket size i and arrival rate i . <p> First, we need to introduce some notation that will be useful in the following discussion. Suppose that messages from all connections arrive together at time t = 0. This situation gives the worst case delay for all connections when using GPS scheduling <ref> [15] </ref>. Let A i (0; t) denote the number of bits of connection M i traffic that have arrived by time t. <p> The normalized service curve for the GPS server is defined as S (0; t) = S j (0; t)= j . The following lemma, which follows from <ref> [15] </ref>, relates the normalized service curve to the service curves of all connections. 1 The analysis in [15] assumes a fluid traffic model, in which bits arrive continuously. Hence, in discussing GPS we will also assume that bits arrive continuously. <p> The normalized service curve for the GPS server is defined as S (0; t) = S j (0; t)= j . The following lemma, which follows from <ref> [15] </ref>, relates the normalized service curve to the service curves of all connections. 1 The analysis in [15] assumes a fluid traffic model, in which bits arrive continuously. Hence, in discussing GPS we will also assume that bits arrive continuously. <p> switch with GPS scheduling, the maximum delay of a message from connection M i , denoted d max i GPS , is given by d max where t 0 is a moment of time which satisfies the following: S (0; t 0 ) = A 0 i : (27) Parekh <ref> [15] </ref> has shown that the maximum delay experienced by a message under PGPS scheduling is no more than the delay under GPS plus C max , where C max is the maximum packet length. Therefore, we have the following theorem.

The switch consists of four parts: input and output controllers at the input and output ports, respectively, the control unit, and the switching fabric. When a cell arrives at an input controller, it is assigned an output port address.
