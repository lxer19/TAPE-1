Abstract: Traditional image compression techniques seek the smallest possible file size for a given level of image quality. By contrast, network-conscious image compression techniques take into account the fact that a compressed image will be transmitted over a network that may lose and reorder packets. We describe GIFNCa, a network-conscious revision of the popular GIF89a standard. 1 As with GIF89a, GIFNCa compresses an image using LZW encoding 2 , however GIFNCa does so using an Application Level Framing approach. The data is segmented into path MTU-size data units, each of which can be independently decompressed and displayed on its own. Under lossy network conditions, when used in combination with an unordered transport protocol, GIFNCa permits faster progressive display at the receiver than GIF89a over an ordered transport protocol. This advantage comes in exchange for a small penalty in overall compression. This paper defines GIFNCa, and presents preliminary experimental data concerning this tradeoff. The overall goal of this research is to illustrate (1) the value of considering network characteristics in designing image formats, and (2) the value of unordered transport service.

Reference-contexts: Using GIFNCa, the same tank image was compressed to 56.5K, 50K, and 45K for the three path MTU sizes 292 bytes, 576 bytes and 1500 bytes, respectively. These path MTU sizes are typical for: PPP links, the minimum size required for all Internet hosts <ref> [1] </ref>, and Ethernets, respectively. The GIFNCa compression ratios are 1.13, 1.29, and 1.41, respectively. These ratios are 24.7%, 14.1%, and 6.1% lower (i.e., worse) than the compression achieved using GIF89a. Similar measurements are presented in Table 1 for the other eight images.

Reference-contexts: Hence GIFNCa images can be transported across the Internet with transport services that offer an unordered reliable service rather than an ordered service (see Figure 4). Unordered protocols can offer shorter delays than ordered protocols such as TCP <ref> [2] </ref>. Case (2) exists when the application can tolerate some image loss. Then the communication channel can be unordered and either unreliable (e.g., UDP/IP), or partially reliable [4, 9, 13].

Reference-contexts: The tradeoff between GIFNCa and GIF89a is one of compression vs. progressive display performance. GIF89a's advantage is its expected better compression. GIFNCa's advantage is its expected faster progressive display at the receiver. The principle behind network-conscious image compression is Application Level Framing <ref> [5] </ref>. At the application layer, an image is divided into units no larger than the connection's path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) 3 . Each unit is independent and "carries its semantics".

Reference-contexts: TCP enhances the unreliable IP network service into a totally reliable, ordered transport connection (see Figure 3), but at the cost of extra delay and throughput.

Reference-contexts: Therefore each unit can be delivered to the receiving application out-of-order to be immediately decompressed and displayed, thereby enabling faster progressive image display. An excellent description of the issues of out-of-order processing and some general simulation and experimental results can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. Depending on whether or not an application can tolerate loss, there are two cases. Case (1) exists when the application must eventually receive the entire image without loss. Here the communication channel between the compressed GIFNCa file and the display must be reliable, although not necessarily ordered.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Although the GIF89a compression standard <ref> [8] </ref> is intended for the on-line transmission and interchange of images, the file format is defined with the assumption that the channel between the storage of the file and the display of the image is totally ordered and reliable (i.e., no bit errors, no loss, no duplicates). <p> The reader uninterested in these specific differences can skip to Section 3. 2.1 GIFNCa Field Descriptions Some level of detail is necessary to fully understand what issues were confronted when transforming the existing GIF89a standard into a network-conscious one. Additional details on GIF89a can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. In the following writeup, a prefix of [NEW] indicates a field introduced from the GIF89a version. A prefix of [MODIFIED] indicates a change. Essentially, there are two types of ADUs that comprise a GIFNCa image: (1) color map ADUs, and (2) data ADUs.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, wireless networks, which are becoming more available, motivate network-conscious image compression because they suffer from high bit error rates and hand-off 11 problems resulting in even more packet losses <ref> [11] </ref>. * As transmission delay between end points increases, so too will the expected time between image updates thereby favoring a network-conscious approach.

Reference-contexts: But presuming an underlying reliable, ordered channel is a costly assumption when the channel is the Internet. In this case, the foundation channel is the IP network layer protocol <ref> [14] </ref> which is inherently unreliable; packets are regularly lost and misordered. Applications such as Web browsers that communicate GIF89a images over the Internet's unreliable service are required to use TCP [15] on top of IP.

Reference-contexts: Since GIFNCa tries to eliminate network layer fragmentation/reassembly, it restricts the ADU size to the path MTU. Therefore, the LZW compression <ref> [19, 20] </ref> on a single image within an image file must be interrupted at some point not to exceed this maximum ADU size. <p> In Section 4, we discuss future experiments that will take into account TCP-compatible congestion control. 3.1 GIFNCa's Compression Disadvantage Past experiments show that the highest efficiency point for LZW compression is around 6K of compressed data <ref> [19] </ref>. Blocks smaller than 6K are penalized by LZW's start-up overhead. Blocks larger than 6K suffer a loss of efficiency because they lack stable statistics. Since a typical path MTU size is usually 500-1500 bytes, GIFNCa is expected to result in a lower compression ratio.
