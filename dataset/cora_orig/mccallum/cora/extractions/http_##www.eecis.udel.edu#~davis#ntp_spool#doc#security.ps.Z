Abstract: DRAFT Report to the PSRG Page 1 of 20 A Security Analysis of the NTP Protocol ABSTRACT The Network Time Protocol is being used throughout the Internet to provide an accurate time service. This note examines the security requirements of such a service, analyzes the NTP protocol to determine how well it meets these requirements, and suggests improvements where appropriate. My comments are in this style(with change bars to the left). They will be gone from the final report, but I do have some questions and/or comments Id appreciate help on. Of course, all comments, criticisms, and suggestions are always welcome, but these comments are things Id especially like your thoughts on.

Reference-contexts: These messages do not normally cause synchronization, but instead indicate the peers variables associated with the host, or change the variables associated with peer or the remote system, or indicate exception events have occurred. They are designed for use when no other network management facilities (such as SNMP <ref> [1] </ref>) are available, and these commands may be sent by other than NTP peers. Further, they need not be supported by conforming NTP implementations. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: This is summarized in Figure 6. The checksum is currently computed using the Data Encryption Standard based DEA-1 algorithm (that is, DES in CBC mode) <ref> [2] </ref>.
Reference: [3] <institution> Information Sciences Institute, Internet Protocol, </institution> <note> RFC 791 (Sep. </note> <year> 1981). </year>
Reference-contexts: This provides some protection in the case of one portion of the network (or one intermediate host) being untrusted. Unfortunately, it provides no protection against someone forging a packet with a good route. Routing information added using the IP record route option <ref> [3] </ref> (which causes intermediate nodes to insert their address into the IP datagram) is not checksummed cryptographically, and so can be altered in transit without detection. 3.2.
Reference: [4] <author> B. Kaliski, Jr., R. Rivest, and A. Sherman, </author> <title> Is the Data Encryption Standard a Group? (Results of Cycling Experiments on DES), </title> <journal> Journal of Cryptography 1(1) pp. </journal> <month> 3-36 </month> <year> (1988). </year>
Reference-contexts: In particular, if any n hosts have the same key, then it will not be possible to determine which of them sent the message. No key distribution mechanism is defined. The integrity checking algorithm used is subject to various cryptanalytic attacks which have been discussed in the literature <ref> [4] </ref> because the check is only 64 bits long; however, as these attacks are probabilistic in nature, changing the keys periodically will defeat them.
Reference: [5] <author> S. Kent and J. Linn, </author> <title> Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail: Part II -- Certificate-Based Key Management, </title> <address> RFC-1114 (Aug. </address> <year> 1989). </year>
Reference-contexts: Further, the different keys do not affect the time needed for authentication, but merely the time needed to administrate the key distribution. As key distribution is out of the scope of the NTP protocol, we merely note that a certificate-based mechanism as used in <ref> [5] </ref> could be used to distribute keys on a per-peer path basis.

Reference-contexts: The first is that none of the major security-oriented protocols allow broadcast, because broadcasting unforgeable, authenticated packets would imply the use of a public-key checksumming scheme, and no such scheme runs quickly enough to be used in that context (the best-studied, RSA, runs at 1150 bits/second on a Sun 3/60 <ref> [6] </ref>; given that the checksum should be on the order of 512 bits, this would mean that at most only 2 packets could be processed per second). 25 The second is that few such protocols are in widespread use.
