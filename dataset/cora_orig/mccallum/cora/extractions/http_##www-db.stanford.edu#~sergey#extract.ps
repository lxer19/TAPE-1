Title: Extracting Patterns and Relations from the World Wide Web  
Author: Sergey Brin 
Address: Stanford University  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department  
Abstract: The World Wide Web is a vast resource for information. At the same time it is extremely distributed. A particular type of data such as restaurant lists may be scattered across thousands of independent information sources in many different formats. In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting a relation for such a data type from all of these sources automatically. We present a technique which exploits the duality between sets of patterns and relations to grow the target relation starting from a small sample. To test our technique we use it to extract a relation of (author,title) pairs from the World Wide Web.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in these we only made passes over subsets of the repository on any given iteration. An important note for this project is that the repository contains almost no web pages from Amazon <ref> [Ama] </ref>. This is because their automatically generated urls make crawling difficult. 5.2 Pattern Relation Expansion Isaac Asimov The Robots of Dawn David Brin 3 Startide Rising James Gleick Chaos: Making a New Science Charles Dickens Great Expectations William Shakespeare The Comedy of Errors Fig. 1. Initial sample of books. <p> The current one is available online [Bri]. 5.3 Quality of Results To analyse the quality of the results, we picked twenty random books out of the list and attempted to verify that they were actual books by searching on Amazon <ref> [Ama] </ref>, the Visa Shopping Guide for books [Vis], the Stanford online library catalog, and the Web. 4 As a measure of the quality of the results, 19 of the 20 were all bonafide books.

Reference-contexts: Many more experiments are in progress. 5.1 Web Data Used in Experiments For data we used a repository of 24 million web pages totalling 147 gigabytes. This data is part of the Stanford WebBase and is used for the Google search engine <ref> [BP] </ref> and other research projects. As a part of the search engine, we have built an inverted index of the entire repository. The repository spans many disks and several machines.

Reference-contexts: These in turn generated 346 patterns. Scanning over the same set of documents produced 15257 unique books with very little bogus data. (See Figure 4) This experiment is ongoing and hopefully, a larger list of books will be generated soon. The current one is available online <ref> [Bri] </ref>. 5.3 Quality of Results To analyse the quality of the results, we picked twenty random books out of the list and attempted to verify that they were actual books by searching on Amazon [Ama], the Visa Shopping Guide for books [Vis], the Stanford online library catalog, and the Web. 4

Reference-contexts: In this case, the user may also provide an R 0 , a list of counterexamples. 6.2 Implications of Automatic Extraction One of the most surprising results of this experiment was finding books which were not listed in major online sources such as the book "Disbanded" by Douglas Clark <ref> [Cla] </ref> which is published online or "The Young Gardeners' Kalendar" by Dollie Radford [Rad04] an obscure work published in 1904.

Reference-contexts: A generated pattern is assigned a weight based on the weights of the tuples which match it. If this is done linearly, this technique breaks down to a singular value decomposition of the tuple-pattern matrix (multiplied by its transpose). This is analogous to Latent Semantic Indexing <ref> [DDF + 90] </ref> which is done on the document-word matrix. In this case, the eventual steady state is the dominant eigenvector. Unfortunately, this is independent of the initial sample which is clearly not desirable. Nonetheless, the relationship to LSI is compelling and bears further investigation.

If the book list can be expanded and if almost all books listed in online sources can be extracted, the resulting list may be more complete than any existing book database.
