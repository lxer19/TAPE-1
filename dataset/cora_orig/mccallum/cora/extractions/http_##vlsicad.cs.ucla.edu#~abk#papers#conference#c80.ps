Abstract: Increasingly popular reuse-based design paradigms create a pressing need for authorship enforcement techniques that protect the intellectual property rights of designers. We develop the first intellectual property protection protocols for embedding design watermarks at the physical design level. We demonstrate that these protocols are transparent with respect to existing industrial tools and design flows, and that they can embed watermarks into real-world industrial designs with very low implementation overhead (as measured by such standard metrics as wirelength, layout area, number of vias, routing congestion and CPU time). On several industrial test cases, we obtain extremely strong, tamper-resistant proofs of authorship for placement and routing solutions.

Reference-contexts: Region constraints are transparent to top-down placers, since iterative partitioners accomodate fixed preassign-ments (see [2] for a review). Annealing placers (see [10] for a review) also support such constraints by restricting move generation, and analytic placers support region constraints via inequalities or center-of-gravity constraints (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a review). Grouping constraints are typically enforced by inducing contracted netlists over clustered representations of the design.

Reference-contexts: Refined constraints can often be viewed as created by a budgeting or allocation process, e.g., when a global path delay constraint is broken up into separate edge delay constraints. 5 This has been generally characterized as a big valley <ref> [3] </ref> or massif central [6]; the phenomenon has also been specifically documented for standard-cell placements under the minimum wirelength objective [4]. 3 Watermarking Standard-Cell Place and Route We have considered a variety of mechanisms by which standard-cell physical design can be constrained.

Reference-contexts: We center on the physical design phase for several reasons. * Physical design is traditionally viewed as a difficult domain, where even a small percentage variation in solution quality can make or break a design, and where high-quality solutions are known to have strong structural resemblance to each other <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> a budgeting or allocation process, e.g., when a global path delay constraint is broken up into separate edge delay constraints. 5 This has been generally characterized as a big valley [3] or massif central [6]; the phenomenon has also been specifically documented for standard-cell placements under the minimum wirelength objective <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 Watermarking Standard-Cell Place and Route We have considered a variety of mechanisms by which standard-cell physical design can be constrained.

Reference-contexts: As a result, development of intellectual property protection (IPP) techniques and tools has emerged as a very prominent open research topic. In this work, we develop the first protocols for IPP at the physical design level, using the concept of constraint-based watermarking. As defined in <ref> [5] </ref>, a design watermark is an invisible (i.e., imperceptible to human or machine analysis) identification code that is permanently embedded as an integral part within a design. <p> In <ref> [5] </ref>, we list other watermarking desiderata, and describe a canonical approach to watermarking-based IPP where additional constraints encoding the IP author's signature are added into a given design optimization instance. <p> The solution of the optimization instance, in satisfying these constraints (which would be unlikely in a random solution to the original instance), implicitly contains a proof of authorship. The approach described in <ref> [5] </ref> is transparent to existing design flows in that it relies on preprocessing (of inputs) or fl Work by M. Potkonjak and G. Wolfe supported in part by DARPA under grant N66001-97-2-8901. Work by A. B. Kahng, S. Mantik, I. L. Markov, P. Tucker and H. <p> tools is, in our experience, a very nontrivial task. 2 When preprocessing is used, two designs (one without additional signature constraints, and one with) must be realized in order to determine the hardware overhead incurred by IPP. 2 Related Work Related work in artifact watermarking and cryptography is reviewed in <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 We therefore focus our survey of related concepts within the physical design realm. No previous work in the literature deals with watermarking of physical design solutions. However, constraint specification and management now receive close attention through all phases of chip implementation, including physical design. <p> row assignments (let alone the locations) of existing cells during routing; hence, our proposed watermarking scheme will remain intact. * It allows the watermark to be realized completely during the placement phase. (For schemes such as the watermarking of budgeted timing constraints, the realization remains incom plete until after routing <ref> [5] </ref>.) 6 The impact on solution quality is even worse when the design is performance-constrained. <p> threshold rank at the 40th percentile, i.e., p = 0:4. (Stronger results can be obtained by more carefully choosing the value of p; this is noted below.) 4.4 Resistance to Tampering Attacks Another way to evaluate the strength of a given watermark is to assess its resistance to attacks (see <ref> [5] </ref> for a survey of prototypical attacks).

Reference-contexts: A static timing analysis engine may operate directly from the clock cycle times/offsets and I/O boundary timing to evaluate timing correctness, without explicit enumeration of timing path constraints. For purposes of layout design, path delay constraints are typically budgeted into individual constraints on source-sink edges <ref> [11] </ref>. * Physical (floorplanning) constraints. To improve timing convergence of the design process, assumptions made during RTL floorplanning or block floorplanning must be propagated to downstream flow stages (e.g., placement and global routing).
