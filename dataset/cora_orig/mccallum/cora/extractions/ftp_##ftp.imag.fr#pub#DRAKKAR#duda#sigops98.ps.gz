Reference-contexts: Currently, we use a simple method of distillation images are converted to JPEG and degraded according to the user requested quality using ImageMagic package <ref> [1] </ref>. The volume is reduced substantially, much more then by a loss-less compression process. Table 1 shows how much the size of images is reduced when converted with different quality (this value corresponds to JPEG quality setting: quality is from 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 75).

Reference-contexts: Another solution to the bandwidth bottleneck is based on distillation: the quality of media objects is degraded according to the needs of the user before an object is downloaded to a nomadic host. Several projects such as Daedalus <ref> [3] </ref> and Odyssey [7] have investigated this approach. Distillation reduces the volume of the information to be transported over low bandwidth wireless links, however, this operation is done when the user awaits the data, so its overhead is a part of the user response time.

Reference-contexts: An example of such an approach is Rover that adapts the client-server model to nomadic environment. By using queued remote procedure calls, it provides a uniform distributed object architecture for code shipping, object caching, and asynchronous object invocation <ref> [4] </ref>. Our approach is based on a different paradigm|delegation by means of mobile agents that an application activates to execute tasks on remote nodes. Mobile agents can move from node to node, perform useful operations and report results.

Reference-contexts: Previous work in this domain has shown that performance can be improved by using a specialized transport protocol instead of TCP|the useful application bandwidth attains 8.7 Kbit/s <ref> [5] </ref>. Another solution to the bandwidth bottleneck is based on distillation: the quality of media objects is degraded according to the needs of the user before an object is downloaded to a nomadic host. Several projects such as Daedalus [3] and Odyssey [7] have investigated this approach.

Reference-contexts: The paradigm is intrinsically asynchronous|an application can disconnect after agent activation and retrieve results later on. We have developed an application called Alycta that allows efficient access to WWW from mobile hosts connected via GSM.
