Abstract: A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint Logic). In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems, examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal form. We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems, and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical approaches.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Present work on inductive concept-learning is usually classified as belonging to either the attribute value learning paradigm (see <ref> [ Quinlan, 1986; Michalski, 1983; Clark and Niblett, 1989 ] </ref> , etc.) or the inductive logic programming paradigm [ Mug-gleton and De Raedt, 1994; Muggleton, 1992 ] . The differences between the two paradigms are due to the representation formalism employed.

Reference-contexts: A possible explanation for this comes from the fact that in attribute value learning examples are true and false interpretations (i.e. models and non-models, or positive and negative examples) of a target theory, whereas in inductive logic programming, examples are true and false facts (or clauses). Recently, <ref> [ De Raedt and Van Laer, 1995 ] </ref> have defined a notion of concept-learning in first order logic, in which examples are true and false interpretations of a target theory, and the target theory is a set of clauses. <p> So whenever we say an example e is true (false) for a clause (or theory), we mean that M (B [ e) is true (false) for that clause (theory). This setting is illustrated in Examples 1 and 2 (taken from <ref> [ De Raedt and Van Laer, 1995 ] </ref> ). Example 1 The well-known autolander problem (from the Irvine database) is described by a table (see figure 1) in attribute value representation (only a part is shown). This attribute value learning problem can directly be specified in terms of the framework. <p> This relationship between CNF and DNF will be illustrated in the mutagenesis experiments. 2.4 Practical aspects For a complete overview of the algorithm, we refer to <ref> [ De Raedt and Van Laer, 1995 ] </ref> . There is a working implementation in ProLog by BIM. ICL uses a covering approach, and uses beam search as search strategy.

Reference-contexts: First, notice that ICL is meant to learn binary concepts from examples. As such it addresses the same task as propositional learners (but in a more expressive framework) and it does not learn logic programs from examples as Progol, FOIL and many other ILP systems do, cf. <ref> [ Muggleton and De Raedt, 1994 ] </ref> . In these systems, examples are usually true and false ground facts of a target predicate, and the result is a logic program.

Reference-contexts: This corresponds to learning a conjunc-tive normal form instead of a disjunctive normal form. Furthermore, as examples are interpretations, most of the other attribute value learning techniques, such as noise handling heuristics, can be nicely upgraded towards the ICL framework. Some experiments on the mutagenesis problem <ref> [ Srinivasan et al., 1994 ] </ref> show that the current implementation of ICL already works quite well (i.e. almost as well as Progol, and better than FOIL), but also indicate a number of possible improvements to ICL. <p> Furthermore, for many complex and structural induction problems the view that examples are interpretations is a very natural one, cf. for instance the bongard problems (see example 2), the drug activity problem [ King et al., 1992 ] , the mutagenesis problem <ref> [ Srinivasan et al., 1994 ] </ref> and Michalski's classical eastbound westbound train problem [ Michalski and Stepp, 1983 ] , which was recently used as the basis for a machine learning competition. 2.3 CNF and DNF Class Descriptions Classical ILP systems learn a logic program that enables one to discriminate between

Reference-contexts: First of all, we have run it on the same data on which Progol and FOIL have been run (see <ref> [ Srinivasan et al., 1995a ] </ref> ), to have a means of comparing ICL with these systems. In [ Srinivasan et al., 1995a ] , four different background theories are used, and the results of FOIL and Progol compared. <p> First of all, we have run it on the same data on which Progol and FOIL have been run (see <ref> [ Srinivasan et al., 1995a ] </ref> ), to have a means of comparing ICL with these systems. In [ Srinivasan et al., 1995a ] , four different background theories are used, and the results of FOIL and Progol compared. In the experiment we discuss here, we use background B3 of the above paper, which consists of knowledge about atoms, bonds, log P and * LUMO . <p> Also, ICL does not show the strong bias towards numeric equations that is apparent in FOIL's theories (with this background knowledge, FOIL uses only equations on log P and * LUMO values in its theory, and no structural conditions; see <ref> [ Srinivasan et al., 1995a ] </ref> ). The theories found by ICL are therefore closer to Progol's than to FOIL's.
