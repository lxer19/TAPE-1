Abstract: DRAMs contain a very wide datapath internal to the chip which can deliver orders of magnitude greater memory bandwidth inside the chip than through the pins. The dilemma lies in deciding what to connect to the other end of this wide pipe to memory. We compare two alternatives: microprocessors (including MIMD multiprocessors) and SIMD processors. Microprocessors are better accepted and are suited to more applications. SIMD processors can better utilize the memory bandwidth available internal to the DRAM chips. These approaches can coexist.

Reference-contexts: Energy Efficiency When the computing is done in the memory, less energy is consumed in sending data between chips. Energy can also be saved if each memory row access is better utilized <ref> [3] </ref>. CRAM PEs consume 10-25% of the chip power. The sensing energy per memory row access dominates.
