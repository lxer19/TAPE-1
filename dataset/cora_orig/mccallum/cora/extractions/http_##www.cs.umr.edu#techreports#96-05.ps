Title: Fast Algorithms for Maze Routing on an RMESH  
Author: F. Ercal and H. C. Lee

Abstract: The routing problem is one of the most widely studied problems in VLSI design. Maze-routing algorithms are used in VLSI routing and robot path planning. Efficiency of the parallel maze routing algorithms which were mostly based on Lee's algorithm is poor. In this paper, we propose time-efficient algorithms to solve the maze-routing problem on a reconfigurable mesh architecture. The constant-time algorithms presented include: (i) testing the existence of specific types of paths between two terminals, (ii) finding an absolute shortest path (ASP) and a shortest duplex-path (SDP). In addition, fast algorithms are presented for finding the shortest triplex-path (STP) and the single shortest path (SSP). The simulation results indicate that a large percentage of the shortest paths that exist between two randomly selected terminals fall into one of the categories studied in this paper.

Since the wavefront expansion in Lee's algorithm is sequential in nature, the efficiency of the proposed parallel algorithms is limited.

Then, the Lee's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> was run repeatedly to find the shortest paths between 100 randomly selected source and target cells. Each time a path was found, it was analyzed and put into one of the following categories: ASP, DASP, TASP, and PolyPath.
