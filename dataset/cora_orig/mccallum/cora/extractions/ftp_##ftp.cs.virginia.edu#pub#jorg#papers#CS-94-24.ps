Abstract: New network applications which involve transmission of continuous media data, such as audio and video conferencing, introduce immense challenges for the design of packet-switching internetworks. Existing flow and congestion control mechanisms have been shown to be ineffective for supporting the real-time requirements of continuous media data transfers. We propose a novel bandwidth regulation mechanism which improves the ability of the network to cope with multiple real-time and non real-time traffic classes. The mechanism achieves regulation of link bandwidth at two levels. At one level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between different traffic classes. We introduce the concept of inter-class regulation which enforces that the bandwidth left unused by some traffic classes is assigned equally to traffic classes with high bandwidth demands. At the second level, bandwidth regulation is enforced on packet flows from the same class. Each end-to-end packet flow from the same class has identical bandwidth constraints if their routes share the link with the smallest capacity for this class. This concept is referred to as intra-class regulation. We show that a bandwidth assignment which provides both intra-class and inter-class regulation without unnecessary waste of bandwidth is uniquely determined. We present a simple distributed protocol that achieves intra-class and inter-class regulation in a general internetwork. The protocol does not require network gateways to maintain state information on individual traffic flows, and adapts quickly to changes in the traffic load. The effectiveness of the protocol is demonstrated by simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Until recently, traffic on the Internet was dominated by applications for file transfers, electronic mail, electronic bulletin boards, and remote login <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. This type of traffic requires reliable transport service at the user level, but is only moderately sensitive to the amount and the variance of end-to-end delays. With the availability of audio/video hardware, numerous applications have been developed which enable the participation in audio and video-conferencing over the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Currently, research on bandwidth regulation mechanisms is conducted in two domains. In the previous section, we have discussed the need for new traffic control methods in internetworks. The second domain of research is B-ISDN, where new bandwidth control algorithms are needed for efficient implementations of connectionless data services <ref> [2] </ref>. One approach to bandwidth regulation is based on scheduling algorithms at the gateways. Fair Queueing and its variations [5, 6, 18], and Round-Robin [11], have shown to satisfy certain fairness criteria for either individual flows or flow classes, however, not for both.

Reference-contexts: In yet another approach, each overloaded flow source periodically transmits its state to the bottleneck gateways, and the gateways periodically reset their information on overloaded flows. This solution, if properly implemented, keeps only soft-state information at gateways <ref> [3] </ref>, and provides robustness in the presence of gateway failures. * Selection of Update Periods and Sensitivity During State Transitions The stability of the bandwidth regulation scheme is sensitive to the size of the update interval. The sensitivity should be similar to the selection of update periods in routing protocols.

Reference-contexts: Resources can be allocated such that the requirements of flows are guaranteed even in worst-case situations. A different approach to resource reservation with admission control in internetworks is given in <ref> [4, 16, 20] </ref>. Note that resource reservation with admission control, if implemented in the Internet, will have serious implications. First, since network resources are dedicated to a particular flow, the network can no longer be viewed as a shared resource.

Reference-contexts: This effect is due to the asynchronous nature of our protocol, and can be prevented by slowly increasing the transmission rates of new flows, similar to slow start in TCP <ref> [14] </ref>. * Non-Cooperative Sources and Gateways Our protocol assumes that all sources are well-behaved in that they properly adjust their rate control parameters. Also we assume that all network gateways execute the bandwidth regulation protocol.

Reference-contexts: In these studies, the objective of the regulation mechanisms is referred to as link sharing. Link sharing approaches provide some notion of inter-class regulation, but do not address at all bandwidth regulation of flows from the same class (intra-class regulation). For example, Steenstrup <ref> [21] </ref> proposes a hierarchical structure of flow classes with bandwidth guarantees for each class. Guarantees can be allocated statically or dynamically. Regulation of link bandwidth is performed exclusively at the gateways. Traffic measurements are used to adapt the throughput guarantees to actual transmitted traffic. <p> A third hierarchical and highly flexible approach to link sharing is presented by Floyd [9].

For example, by using exponential moving averages as in <ref> [21] </ref>, load and state changes will not have immediate consequences 21 in the network. If new flows start transmission, the throughput of existing flows can degrade temporarily for the duration of one update interval.
