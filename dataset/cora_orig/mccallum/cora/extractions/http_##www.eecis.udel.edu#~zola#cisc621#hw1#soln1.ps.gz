Abstract: We know that: P n i=1 x i = x x n 1 x1 ; with x 6= 1 (this is the sum of gemetric series) Dioeerentiating we get both sides we get: Multiplying both sides by x we get: We now substitute a for x and we get: For a = 1, back to our original formula, we have: n X ia i = i=1 n(n + 1) ; f or a = 1
