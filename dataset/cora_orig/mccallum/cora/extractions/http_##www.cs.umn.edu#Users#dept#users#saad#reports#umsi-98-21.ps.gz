Title: Eigenvalue bounds from the Schur form  
Author: Thierry Braconnier Yousef Saad 
Keyword: Fike inequalities.  
Date: February 12, 1998  
Abstract: Computing the partial Schur form of a matrix is a common kernel in widely used software for solving eigenvalues problems. Partial Schur forms and Schur vectors also arise naturally in deflation techniques. In this paper, error bounds are proposed which are based on the Schur form of a matrix. We show how the bounds derived for the general case simplify in special situations such as those of Hermitian matrices or partially normal or nearly normal matrices. The derived bounds are similar to well-known bounds such as the Kato-Temple and the Bauer

Reference-contexts: Estimating fl is clearly harder in the non-normal case. However, it is important to separate the difficulty inherent in estimating the condition number from that of estimating errors. Condition numbers can be estimated by heuristics <ref> [1] </ref>. A trivial point in case, would be to perturb data slightly in certain ways and recompute approximate eigenvectors.

Except for the denominator term this is very similar to the Bauer-Fike inequality. In fact the denominator should be close to one if the eigenvector is accurate enough.
