Reference-contexts: The performance of deterministic routing schemes have been widely studied, and unlike adaptive routing several analytic models of these systems have been developed [AV92, KD91, Dal90, CE91, Dal92]. In our comparisons of adaptive versus deterministic routing, we use the model presented and analyzed in <ref> [Aga91] </ref>, in which infinite queues associated with output channels are used. The most general adaptive routing schemes can make use of any path in the network, regardless of length, the presence of loops, or any other factors. <p> Thus, although deadlock avoidance schemes will indirectly affect performance, they have been excluded from the scope of the study presented here. Instead, as in <ref> [Aga91] </ref>, deadlock is avoided in our model by the use of infinite buffer stores. 3 System Model The communication network being modeled is composed of processing nodes which send messages over unidirectional communication channels. <p> message, is given by = n (k 1)=2 If the source and destination or a message must always be distinct, which is assumed in our model, then the expression is: = n 2 (k n 1) (k 1) The relation between the channel utilization and other network parameters, as in <ref> [Aga91] </ref>, is given by: c = n In order to analytically derive the expected latency of a message by modeling the behavior of the queues at each node, we first determine the probabilities governing the arrival and routing of messages at the queues, and then use these probabilities to predict their

Reference-contexts: In [LDT93], Liu et al evaluated expected channel utilization for a class of deadlock-free algorithms, again in mesh networks. Kim and Chien [KC93] assessed the effects of packetization on adaptive routing performance, Nowatzyk [Now89] has investigated a communication architecture using an adaptive algorithm, and recently Boppana and Chalasani <ref> [BC93] </ref> presented a comparative study of several deadlock free adaptive routing schemes. Almost all of the performance evaluation 3 studies of direct networks, however, have made use solely of simulation experiments. In contrast to studies of deterministic routing, very little analytic work has been done.

Reference-contexts: Often a message will have a choice of channels on which to exit a node, and arbitrating among choices is made on the basis of an output selection policy. For instance, one scheme that has been investigated extensively is the use of random routing [Val82]. Other researchers such as <ref> [LH91, CK92, DG92] </ref> have investigated adaptive routing as a means of adding fault-tolerance. In this study, we will focus on adaptive routing which makes use only of minimal distance paths. <p> Thus, we choose to compare the two in an idealized situation, where routing overhead is ignored. 2.4 Deadlock Deadlock is another important consideration in designing a network system, and one that has been the subject of numerous studies. Various avoidance techniques have been proposed, such as in 7 <ref> [LMN93, SS93, CK92, GN92b, SJ93, LH91, LGS92] </ref>. In general, deadlock avoidance is achieved either by restricting routing or by the addition of hardware such as virtual channels, as proposed in [DS87]. A recent study describing a new model of deadlock freedom can be found in [Dua93].

Reference-contexts: This is a general family of graphs which has become increasingly popular among researchers and has been implemented in a number of existing machines <ref> [Dal89, Com85, Hay86, Res93] </ref>. A k-ary n-cube is a direct network with N = k n nodes; k is called the radix and n the dimension. A k-ary 1-cube is a ring, and a k-ary n-cube can be built be connecting k copies of k-ary (n 1)-cubes in a ring. <p> Moreover, this eliminates the problem of livelock, in which messages travel around the network without progressing towards their destinations. Deterministic routing is simple and easily implemented, with minimal overhead. It has been implemented in various machines such as the N-cube <ref> [Com85] </ref> and the Cray T3D [Res93]. Adaptive routing, on the other hand, allows for more flexibility at the cost of additional complexity in the algorithm and its implementation. The study presented here will focus on evaluating the potential improvement of adaptive routing over deterministic routing.

This is similar to the use of virtual channels for performance improvement as proposed in <ref> [Dal92] </ref>, where the virtual channels are used as passing lanes to overtake blocked messages. Another approach would be to devise a buffer organization scheme which incorporates the best features of input and output channel buffering.

There are two techniques that do this: wormhole and virtual cut-through. In these systems, messages are divided into flow control units or flits <ref> [DS87] </ref> with the head flit being distinguished. Only the first flit contains the routing information, and messages traverse the network in train-like fashion with all flits using the same channels as the header flit. <p> Various avoidance techniques have been proposed, such as in 7 [LMN93, SS93, CK92, GN92b, SJ93, LH91, LGS92].

A recent study describing a new model of deadlock freedom can be found in [Dua93]. The issue of deadlock, however, is orthogonal to that of performance in the sense that, unlike the three parameters described previously, avoidance mechanisms are not usually designed with the goal of improving communication time.

Reference-contexts: In order to accurately assess the tradeoff and benefits of adaptive routing, we must be able to evaluate the performance potential of these systems. Recent research studies have begun to address this issue, but as yet the problem has not been fully explored. In <ref> [GN92a] </ref>, Glass and Ni compared partially adaptive deadlock free routing schemes to dimension ordered schemes in mesh networks. In [LDT93], Liu et al evaluated expected channel utilization for a class of deadlock-free algorithms, again in mesh networks. <p> Input selection can be random, use schemes such as round-robin, or use state information such as the distance of a message from its destination. See <ref> [GN92a] </ref> for a study which addresses input selection policy. The flow control policy then determines how these waiting messages are managed. In wormhole flow control, the non-header flits of a message are not allowed to advance, and each flit is buffered on a different node.

Reference-contexts: The flow control mechanism also determines the structure of the buffers. For instance, buffers may be queues processed in FCFS order, or they may be pools which use some other criteria to prioritize departure. Studies which have investigated this issue include [TF88] and <ref> [KHM87] </ref>. The flow control mechanism used in the study presented here is virtual cut-through, with buffers associated with input channels. <p> At higher channel utilizations the ratio of maximum queue length is often a factor of two. Note that the deterministic model makes use of output queues (since output channels are statically known when the message arrives). Output queueing strategies are known to have shorter queue sizes <ref> [KHM87] </ref>. This result suggests that an adaptive routing scheme with an output queue strategy would have even smaller maximum queue sizes and that adaptive routing is better at balancing communication load among channels.

Reference-contexts: In virtual cut-through, deadlock can be avoided by using ordered buffers, while in wormhole, buffer management as well as channel management is necessary in order to avoid deadlock. Most research on network performance assumes wormhole flow-control, an excellent survey of which can be found in <ref> [NM93] </ref>. The flow control mechanism must also include the decision on buffer placement. In general buffers can be associated with the input channels, the output channels, or they can be intermediate. Associating buffers with input channels means that messages are buffered before the routing algorithm is applied.

A k-ary 1-cube is a ring, and a k-ary n-cube can be built be connecting k copies of k-ary (n 1)-cubes in a ring. <p> Moreover, this eliminates the problem of livelock, in which messages travel around the network without progressing towards their destinations. Deterministic routing is simple and easily implemented, with minimal overhead. It has been implemented in various machines such as the N-cube [Com85] and the Cray T3D <ref> [Res93] </ref>. Adaptive routing, on the other hand, allows for more flexibility at the cost of additional complexity in the algorithm and its implementation. The study presented here will focus on evaluating the potential improvement of adaptive routing over deterministic routing.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we choose to compare the two in an idealized situation, where routing overhead is ignored. 2.4 Deadlock Deadlock is another important consideration in designing a network system, and one that has been the subject of numerous studies. Various avoidance techniques have been proposed, such as in 7 <ref> [LMN93, SS93, CK92, GN92b, SJ93, LH91, LGS92] </ref>. In general, deadlock avoidance is achieved either by restricting routing or by the addition of hardware such as virtual channels, as proposed in [DS87]. A recent study describing a new model of deadlock freedom can be found in [Dua93].

Reference-contexts: The flow control mechanism also determines the structure of the buffers. For instance, buffers may be queues processed in FCFS order, or they may be pools which use some other criteria to prioritize departure. Studies which have investigated this issue include <ref> [TF88] </ref> and [KHM87]. The flow control mechanism used in the study presented here is virtual cut-through, with buffers associated with input channels.

Reference-contexts: More importantly, because it has been designed to meet the objectives of minimal waiting time and maximal throughput, the strategy has a very good potential for high performance. Optimizing the mapping of messages to channels at a node is analogous to the bipartite graph matching problem <ref> [Tuc84] </ref> by means of the following association: Represent each message and each output channel by a vertex in the graph, with an edge between two vertices whenever the associated message can proceed along the corresponding output channel (i.e., the route tag field for that channel is non-zero). <p> The bipartite matching problem is a well-known combinatorial problem, and various algorithms exist to solve it. The implementation we have chosen in our simulator is based on the Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm, adapted to the case of an unweighted bipartite matching <ref> [Tuc84] </ref>. The complexity of this algorithm is O (jV j 1 2 jEj), where jV j = number of vertices and jEj = number of edges [PS82]. If n is the dimension of the network, then V 2 (n+1) and E (n + 1) 2 .

Reference-contexts: Often a message will have a choice of channels on which to exit a node, and arbitrating among choices is made on the basis of an output selection policy. For instance, one scheme that has been investigated extensively is the use of random routing <ref> [Val82] </ref>. Other researchers such as [LH91, CK92, DG92] have investigated adaptive routing as a means of adding fault-tolerance. In this study, we will focus on adaptive routing which makes use only of minimal distance paths.
