Abstract: Can We Eliminate Certificate Revocation Lists? Abstract. We briefly consider certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and ask whether they could, and should, be eliminated, in favor of other mechanisms. In most cases, the answer seems to be "yes." We suggest some possible replacement mechanisms.

In any case, a certificate typically specifies the issuer, the subject, an issue date, and an expiration date. Certificates are an essential component of any infrastructure to support digital signatures.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notion of a "digital certificate" was introduced by Kohnfelder in his 1978 MIT bachelor's thesis <ref> [2] </ref>. The idea, now common, was that a certificate is a digitally signed statement binding the key-holder's name to a public key. The signer (or issuer) is often called a certificate authority (CA).

Reference-contexts: Proposition 3.The simplest form of "recency evidence" is just a (more-) recently-issued certificate. While this may seem to require an on-line CA, we note that a two-level scheme such as the elegant one suggested by Micali <ref> [4] </ref> can be used to allow an on-line agent to re-validate certificates previously issued by an off-line CA. Naor and Nissim [5] and Kocher [this proceedings] have related proposals. This structure seems to give the right sort of behavior.

If Bob is willing to take a month-old employment certificate, even if it might now be inaccurate, fine.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that such a framework would be an improvement over the use of CRL's. Acknowledgments I'd like to thank Stuart Stubblebine for useful comments and suggestions. The reader might profitably refer to some of his very relevant related work <ref> [7] </ref>.
