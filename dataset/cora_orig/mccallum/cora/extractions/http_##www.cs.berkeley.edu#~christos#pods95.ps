Abstract: The last database theory column initiated a series of articles on the relationship between database theory and practice with a guest column by David Harel: Will I be Pretty, Will I be Rich? Some Thoughts on Theory vs. Practice in Systems Engineering. We continue with an article by Christos H. Papadimitriou, based on his invited talk at PODS '95. Is "database theory" an oxymoron? Or is it a platitude? What is the fitness measure that decides the survival of ideas (and areas) in mathematics, in applied science, and in computer science? Which ideas from database theory during the past twenty-five years have influenced research in other fields of computer science? How many were encapsulated in actual products? Was the relational model the only true paradigm shift in computer science? Is applicability the only and ultimate justification of theoretical research in an applied science? Are applicability pressures really exogenous and unwelcome? Are negative results appropriate goals of theoretical research in an applied science |or are they the only possible such research goals? If scientific theories must be refutable, what are the "hard facts" that provide the possibility of refutation in the case of computer science?

Reference-contexts: This function of theory is what we usually mean by "synthesis" or "positive results." Such results must be actually verified by experiments. The Berkeley-IBM experiment in the middle 1970s <ref> [As, SWKH] </ref>, which established the feasibility of relational databases, was implicitly suggested in database theory's most celebrated positive result, the formulation of the relational model [Co1]. (c) Theoreticians analyze the mathematical models to predict the outcome of the experiments (and calibrate the models).

Reference-contexts: After all, delimitation (discovering that "that's all there is!") is the ultimate success in exploration. Identifying the limitations of a model is valuable information for further model-building, and for crystalizing the subject. For example, the prevalence of a few simple algorithms in concurrency control <ref> [GR, BHG] </ref> is supported by negative results severely delimiting the feasibly implementable solutions and establishing lower bounds on their informational cost [Pa1].

Reference-contexts: Concurrency control is of course inevitable, but most database products seem to have adopted the simplest solutions [GR] (two-phase locking, and occasionally optimistic methods or tree-based locking). And the PODS community contributed much to the dissemination of object-oriented database ideas and systems <ref> [BDK] </ref>. The major disappointment is perhaps the absence of database products that incorporate some of the beautiful ideas our community has developed for the implementation of recursive queries.

Reference-contexts: In my view this is one of the major intellectual achievements that sets computer science apart from other applied sciences. There is a growing body of research <ref> [BPT, PY] </ref> whose goal is to export this "negative methodology" to applied sciences (such as applied mathematics, game theory, and mathematical economics) that are less so endowed. 2 I realize that this sounds like a very sweeping statement.

Reference-contexts: But I highly recommend the obvious prevention: doing your own experiments. issue of negative vs. positive results is confused in a most deliberate and ingenious way. In contrast, Codd's Theorem <ref> [Co2] </ref>, another celebrated result identifying two important concepts (this time relational algebra and relational calculus) is solidly positive because of its double implication that the calculus is implementable and the algebra expressive. 4 What is "Good Theory"? The reader who expects to find in this section rules to be obeyed by <p> The introduction of the relational model was as clear a paradigm shift as we can hope to find in computer science. 7 It fulfills the requirements: (1) It was a powerful and attractive proposal (whose plausibility was expertly supported by theoretical arguments such as Codd's Theorem <ref> [Co2] </ref>); (2) it was explicitly open-ended, a whole framework for research problems, applications, and experiments; (3) it came as the result of a crisis [DBTG] (or was it "immature science", recall Figure 1?); (4) it was indeed followed by a period of normal science.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to know whether, in the case of concurrency control, the negative theoretical results influenced the direction of practice, or simply chronicled and justified ex post facto its choices. I strongly suspect the latter |theory often plays this role. Is Cook's Theorem <ref> [Cook] </ref> a negative result? It makes an ingenious and unexpected connection between two theretofore unrelated ideas: nondeterministic polynomial-bounded computation and Boolean satisfiability (the related result due to Ron Fagin [Fa] makes such a connection between computation and logic even more directly).

Reference-contexts: reality as existent as universe and life, or an artifact consisting of artificial axioms, definitions, and their consequences (or, even more intriguingly, the result of complex interactions between innate ideas and stimuli from social life and the natural sciences). depicts a rather healthy situation: As in any decent random graph <ref> [ER] </ref> there is a giant component (in fact, one with reasonably small diameter) that spans most of the practical-theoretical spectrum.

It makes an ingenious and unexpected connection between two theretofore unrelated ideas: nondeterministic polynomial-bounded computation and Boolean satisfiability (the related result due to Ron Fagin <ref> [Fa] </ref> makes such a connection between computation and logic even more directly). Therefore, it is positive as a metatheorem, in that it reduces the complexity not of the artifact, but of the mathematical landscape.

Reference-contexts: And it has recently become fashionable in computer science to criticize theory and belittle its contributions.

Reference-contexts: calculus is implementable and the algebra expressive. 4 What is "Good Theory"? The reader who expects to find in this section rules to be obeyed by anyone who wants to do good theory will be disappointed immediately, for on this subject I am influenced by the thought of Paul Feyerabend <ref> [Fe] </ref>: "Science is an essentially anarchic enterprise. [: : :] There is no idea that is not capable of improving our knowledge. [: : :] The only principle that does not inhibit progress is `anything goes'." Feyerabend's argument is that such major scientific advances as the defense of the Copernician model

Reference-contexts: It is much harder, but very rewarding and worthwhile, to do work that genuinely contributes to the advancement of another science, while at the same time being proud of its position in computer science <ref> [Ka] </ref>. Applicability by association. "Circular arc graphs are important in compilers." This could very well be a true statement, but it is irrelevant if we go on to solve an obscure and alien to the compiler application problem (my favorite: minimum cover by circular arc graphs).

Reference-contexts: crisis But the ultimate success of a scientific idea is, of course, the launching of a victorious scientific revolution; this is my next subject. 5 On Paradigms and Revolutions Perhaps the most influential idea in the philosophy of natural science has been that of a paradigm, proposed by Thomas Kuhn <ref> [Ku] </ref>. Kuhn argues that natural science evolves roughly as shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The real and appropriate defense here is that Kuhn's ideas have themselves paradigmatic power, and it is hard to think outside their framework; indeed, most philosophers of science since Kuhn work largely within his framework. 6 Lakatos <ref> [La] </ref> briefly discusses the same question for the case of mathematics, arguably also a science of the artificial; my thoughts have been somewhat influenced by his argument.

Reference-contexts: Polynomial-time and NP-completeness is another example of a powerful, open-ended research idea with a long wake that sprang out of something like a crisis |the broadly perceived inability of computability and formal language theories to discern between feasible and infeasible computation| and it is sometimes called a paradigm <ref> [Pa2] </ref>. 8 But remember that it is very difficult to answer such queries on-line. During several famous political and social upheavals, very few of the participants (sometimes only one) had the right answer. For my personal perspective, see the last section.

Simon <ref> [Si] </ref> observes that this complexity is not innate, but it is the result of the adaptation of the artifact to the complexities of the environment. <p> Theory and practice collaborated gloriously if uneasily for two centuries, with theory dominating important domains in applied science due to its academic prowess and prestige (borrowed from the natural sciences, see the introduction of <ref> [Si] </ref> for a discussion of this topic). Serious and systematic ideological attack against the value and necessity of theory in applied science seems to be a novel and disturbing phenomenon of the last decade or so.
