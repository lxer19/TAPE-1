Abstract: Chapter 3: Children as Our Technology Design Partners ++ Technology: How We Design, What We Design and Why , edited by Allison Druin. ABSTRACT Thats silly! Im bored! I like that! Why do I have to do this? What is this for? These are all important responses and questions that come from children. As our design partners in developing new technologies, children can offer bluntly honest views of their world. They have their own likes, dislikes, and needs that are not the same as adults (Druin, Stewart, Proft, Bederson, & Hollan, 1997). As the development of new technologies for children becomes commonplace in industry and university research labs, childrens input into the design and development process is critical. We need to establish new development methodologies that enable us to stop and listen, and learn to collaborate with children of all ages. In the chapter that follows, a discussion of new research methodologies will be presented. Interestingly enough, the one environment for children that has typically been well-researched is the school environment (e.g., Collis & Carleer, 1992; Kay, 1996; Norton, 1992; Ringstaff, Sterns, Hanson, & Schneider, 1993; Tinker, 1993). We believe that this has been the case because school activities lend themselves to the existing observation and participation methodologies. Schools are generally places where children are asked to carry out

Reference-contexts: When children are given the chance to use technology in ways they would like, many times they do not have a defined task and their activities are open-ended and exploratory <ref> (Druin, 1996a) </ref> . Interestingly enough, the one environment for children that has typically been well-researched is the school environment (e.g., Collis & Carleer, 1992; Kay, 1996; Norton, 1992; Ringstaff, Sterns, Hanson, & Schneider, 1993; Tinker, 1993).

Reference-contexts: These children varied in age (3-13 years old) as well as ethnic background (e.g., Native American, Hispanic, African American, Caucasian, and children of recent immigrants from Vietnam, China, and Korea). 2.0 ADAPTING THREE DESIGN METHODOLOGIES Based upon a review of the literature and some initial exploratory studies <ref> (Druin, 1996b) </ref>, we found it necessary to collect data with children in three different ways. The first methodology was adapted from Contextual Inquiry techniques (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1997; Holtzblatt & Jones, 1992; Holtzblatt & Jones, 1995; Holtzblatt & Beyer, 1997).

Reference-contexts: In addition, an example of how these methodologies have been used to develop a prototype drawing tool for children will also be discussed. This work is based upon a year and a half of frequent and intensive direct contact with children <ref> (Druin, Boltman, Miura, Platt, Uscher, & Knotts-Callahan, 1997) </ref>. Hundreds of children were observed in a wide range of activities in diverse southwestern sites: from urban middle class homes, to isolated nonEnglish speaking rural farmhouses, to an intensive 5-day technology camp experience at an international conference. <p> We found that three to five-year old children can be at times nonverbal or less self-reflective in discussing the world around them. Therefore, in order to understand what these childrens needs may be, our observation techniques had to capture childrens exploratory activity patterns <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. We found that a modified form of contextual inquiry could serve this purpose. The second methodology that we developed came to be called Technology Immersion (Boltman, et al., 1998; Druin, et al., 1996). <p> This methodology grew out of our need to see how children use large amounts of technology. We found that if we only observed what children did with what they currently had, we missed what children might do given better circumstances <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. Many times, children had minimal contact with technology in their homes or public places. Therefore, by using the observation techniques of contextual inquiry in a technology-rich environment, we found that many patterns emerged in childrens use of technology. <p> The interactor would avoid asking questions that might steer the activities of the child (e.g., Could you show me this? How about doing that?). For research purposes, we found it important that the interaction be lead by the child user, not the adult researcher <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. With this form of CI, notes were never taken by the interactor. Children clearly felt uncomfortable and distracted if the interactor was taking notes while talking to them. <p> Note-taking seemed to make children feel that they were in school, being tested by a teacher for wrong or right answers. Instead, we found that the interactor should become a participant observer, talking naturally to children and becoming a part of their active experience <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. On the other hand, different researchers acted as the note-takers who recorded what the children did and said. One 3 note-taker recorded the activities (what the user does) and the other note-taker recorded quotes (what the user says). <p> Both note-takers recorded the time so that the quotes and activities could be synchronized in later data analysis. It should be understood that at the time of this research, video cameras were not found to be successful in capturing data <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. We found that children tended to perform when they saw a video camera in the room. In addition, even with small unobtrusive devises, video was still difficult to use in small bedrooms and large public spaces. The sound quality was inaudible in public spaces. <p> In general, children are used to seeing teachers and their parents work in more formal clothes. By wearing informal clothes, researchers had a easier time of developing a more relaxed relationship with their users <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. In the chart that follows a summary of the specific techniques we found to be successful with children are described [See Table 1]. Following a CI session with children, we found it extremely useful to discuss our quick impressions of the research experience (Druin, et al., 1997). <p> with their users <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. In the chart that follows a summary of the specific techniques we found to be successful with children are described [See Table 1]. Following a CI session with children, we found it extremely useful to discuss our quick impressions of the research experience (Druin, et al., 1997). Many times we would discuss the activity patterns we saw emerging, or the process of the research itself. With this technique of quick self-reflection, our research methodology was refined. These discussions were captured in quick notes and used during diagramming sessions. <p> We found children may start a task without finishing it, start another and yet another. Then without pause they might go back to the task they started at the beginning and then start something else anew <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. Thanks to these exploratory activities, we found it more understandable to diagram these experiences based on Patterns of Activity and Roles the Child Played , rather than by task. In this way, a more complete picture emerged of the child. <p> In this way, a more complete picture emerged of the child. We developed a spreadsheet or cell-based diagram [see Table 2] in which the information is broken up into six columns: Time, Quotes, Activities, Activity Pattern, Roles, and Design Ideas <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. The Time column is used to synchronize quotes with activities. The Quotes column contains phrases and sentences said by the child or children during a session. The Activities column contains the observed actions of the child or children during a session. <p> A sample activity pattern that we witnessed was user tells a story about what is on the screen ; a sample role was child as storyteller ; a sample design idea was more user-initiated storytelling activities need to be developed in our technology <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. 2.2 Technology Immersion with Children The second research methodology that we refined to be used with children is Technology Immersion. With this methodology, children were provided with a technology-rich environment where they were decision-makers. <p> Interestingly enough, we have found that children ages 7-10 years old can be productive technology designers even when developing software for older or younger children <ref> (Druin et al., 1997) </ref>. What we have also found is that two to four children paired with two to three adults create an productive brainstorming experience (Druin & Solomon, 1996; Druin et al., 1997). <p> For a summary of the Participatory Design techniques that we have found to work with children, see Table 3. To gain a better understanding of this research methodology, below is an example Participatory Design session. It occurred in April 1997, at the University of New Mexico <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997) </ref>. During this session four design teams were asked to prototype a computer of the future which could help children understand some aspect of the human body. Each group contained two adults and two or three children, ages seven or eight. <p> An adult from the crowd asks, What does it do? The boy responds, You talk to Roger. You ask him what the body does and he tells you. Girl kid joins in, And you touch body parts, like the eyes and Roger tells you what the eyes do. <ref> (Druin, et al., 1997, pp. 17-23) </ref> For photographs showing examples of these Participatory Design sessions and the final prototypes see: http://mtsnmc.unm.edu/intel97. 4.0 RESULTS OF OUR FIELD RESEARCH All too often, we hear, Thats a nice story about a kid, but how does that tell me what technology to design?

Reference-contexts: Generally, children do not have this kind of unlimited access to technology in schools. Many children are lucky if they can use a computer for a 45-minute session a day <ref> (Fulton, 1997) </ref>. It is becoming more common for children to have technology at home, but again their time with technology is limited. Generally, children will have access to a home computer after school and it may be shared 4 with other family members.
