Abstract: Existing routing problems for delay minimization consider the connection of a single source node to a number of sink nodes, with the objective of minimizing the delay from the source to all sinks, or a set of critical sinks. In this paper, we study the problem of routing nets with multiple sources, such as those found in signal busses. This new model assumes that each node in a net may be a source, a sink, or both. The objective is to optimize the routing topology to minimize the total weighted delay between all node pairs (or a subset of critical node pairs). We present a heuristic algorithm for the multiple-source performance-driven routing tree problem based on efficient construction of minimum-diameter minimum-cost Steiner trees. Experimental results on random nets with submicron CMOS IC and MCM technologies show an average of 12.6% and 21% reduction in the maximum interconnect delay, when compared with conventional minimum Steiner tree based topologies. Experimental results on multisource nets extracted from an Intel processor show as much as a 16.1% reduction in the maximum interconnect delay, when compared with conventional minimum Steiner tree based topologies.

Reference-contexts: The result in [11] showed convincingly that interconnect topology optimization has a considerable effect on interconnect delay reduction when the resistance ratio is small. A number of optimized interconnect topologies have been proposed, including bounded-radius bounded-cost trees [9], AHHK trees <ref> [1] </ref>, LAST trees [21], maximum performance trees [7], A-trees [11], low-delay trees [5], and IDW/CFD trees [18]. These methods consider both the traditional concern of low total wire length, and also the path length or Elmore delay between the source node and the timing-critical sink nodes. <p> We assume that the first objective has higher priority than the second one. For simplicity, one may assume that W (p i ; p j ) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, i.e. non-critical pairs of points have weight zero and critical pairs have weight one. Values between 0 and 1 provide a greater degree of freedom in "tuning" for performance optimization, although the heuristic presented here can make only limited use of this. <p> We are interested in the use of path length bounds for critical pairs while minimizing total wire length, possibly through the extension of previous bounded radius bounded cost algorithms such as BRBC [9] and AHHK <ref> [1] </ref>. Driver and wire sizing has proven effective for single source routing problems, and we are extending these to the multiple source domain. For practical VLSI routing applications, we are also considering routing in the presence of obstacles and non-tree topologies with low total tree length.

Reference-contexts: Delay times with respect to the driving nodes are shown in Table 1. Note that the second routing tree, which minimizes the maximum linear delay, does not fall entirely on the Hanan grid [16]. For the single source model under Elmore delay, <ref> [4] </ref> showed that an optimal tree which minimizes the maximum delay to any sink may not be contained by the Hanan grid, but also observed that these cases were rare. <p> The transistor model used for both 0:5m CMOS IC and MCM technologies was the 0:5m CMOS IC technology "nominal" model supplied by MCNC. Interconnect resistance and capacitance parameters are shown in Table 5; these values are the same as those used in [11] and <ref> [4] </ref>. For each technology, we generated 100 test sets for each set size of 4, 8, and 16 randomly placed nodes. <p> Note that existing performance driven interconnect optimization algorithms, listed in Section 1, assume a fixed single driver, making comparisons with these methods inappropriate. As the optimal multisource routing solution does not lie entirely on the Hanan grid in general, the branch and bound method (as used in <ref> [4] </ref>) is difficult to apply. We are unaware of any existing multisource routing algorithm which can be used for a fair comparison. Also, there is no known method to compute an optimal multisource routing solution to evaluate the optimality of our algorithm.

For the MCM experiments, the surface area spanned was 10cm square, with a grid size of 100 microns (resulting in a 1000 by 1000 grid). Segments longer than 10000 microns were broken into smaller segments. <p> Transistor sizes for the inverters were 200:0m fi0:5m and 170:0m fi0:5m for NMOS and PMOS, respectively; these sizes were selected to provide roughly equal rise and fall times, and to provide delay values that were comparable to that of a 25 resistor (as was used in <ref> [11, 5] </ref>). Delay for all cases was measured as the time between the input of the driver reaching 50% of the target value and the sink reaching 50% of its final value. Rise and fall times for the inputs to the drivers were 0:1ns for all tests.

Reference-contexts: This shift produces a situation where the length of the path between a driver and sink can have comparable resistance to that of the transistor channel. Thus, changes to the interconnect length and topology can have a significant impact on delay. The result in <ref> [11] </ref> showed convincingly that interconnect topology optimization has a considerable effect on interconnect delay reduction when the resistance ratio is small. A number of optimized interconnect topologies have been proposed, including bounded-radius bounded-cost trees [9], AHHK trees [1], LAST trees [21], maximum performance trees [7], A-trees [11], low-delay trees [5], and <p> The result in <ref> [11] </ref> showed convincingly that interconnect topology optimization has a considerable effect on interconnect delay reduction when the resistance ratio is small.

These methods consider both the traditional concern of low total wire length, and also the path length or Elmore delay between the source node and the timing-critical sink nodes. <p> We treat the sources and sinks of the routing problem as nodes in a graph, or points on a plane, and restrict path weighting to f0, 1g. Our approach to this problem is through the construction of minimum diameter trees with minimized total wire length. The analysis in <ref> [11] </ref> indicated that total wirelength minimization under a shortest path constraint is an appropriate objective for single source routing problems in submicron design. <p> The second step is to construct a shortest path tree rooted at r with low tree length. A rectilinear shortest path Steiner tree is also called a rectilinear arborescence [22], or an A-Tree in short. Since the A-Tree algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> has proven to be very effective in generating a shortest path Steiner tree on the Manhattan plane with near minimum total wirelength, it is used in the second step of our algorithm. <p> The transistor model used for both 0:5m CMOS IC and MCM technologies was the 0:5m CMOS IC technology "nominal" model supplied by MCNC. Interconnect resistance and capacitance parameters are shown in Table 5; these values are the same as those used in <ref> [11] </ref> and [4]. For each technology, we generated 100 test sets for each set size of 4, 8, and 16 randomly placed nodes. <p> Transistor sizes for the inverters were 20:0m fi0:5m and 19:0m fi0:5m for NMOS and PMOS, respectively; these sizes were selected to provide roughly equal rise and fall times, and to provide delay values that were comparable to that of a 270 resistor (as was used in <ref> [11, 5] </ref>).

Rise and fall times for the inputs to the drivers were 0:1ns for all tests. <p> Tree lengths were comparable. Note that performance improvements for multisource routing problems are not as dramatic as was observed with single source problems <ref> [11] </ref>. An optimization which may be beneficial for source p i may result in poor performance for a second source p j ; thus, the multisource problem has a greater number of constraints, resulting in less improvement in general.

Reference-contexts: The second step is to construct a shortest path tree rooted at r with low tree length. A rectilinear shortest path Steiner tree is also called a rectilinear arborescence <ref> [22] </ref>, or an A-Tree in short. Since the A-Tree algorithm [11] has proven to be very effective in generating a shortest path Steiner tree on the Manhattan plane with near minimum total wirelength, it is used in the second step of our algorithm. <p> Alternatively, for large problems where run time is a consideration, a simpler heuristic by Rao et al. <ref> [22] </ref> (which was the basis for the A-Tree algorithm) may be used instead of the A-Tree algorithm. The most basic variation of our algorithm is called the Minimum Diameter A-Tree (MD A-Tree) algorithm. <p> In cases where n is large, it may be desirable to use a low complexity method to construct a shortest path tree (i.e., <ref> [22] </ref>). In the next subsection, we will present a method for linear time computation of these regions, preventing feasible region construction from dominating the run time. Note that in general, the feasible region defines an area. <p> We can easily show that points which are not candidate root points, but are in the feasible region, do not need to be considered as possible roots (for linear delay and tree length objectives). It was shown in <ref> [22] </ref> that an optimal arboresence can be found on the Hanan grid lines, and we assume that all trees considered are so constrained. We define a Hanan cell to be a rectangular region bounded by a pair of vertically-adjacent Hanan grid lines and a pair of horizontally-adjacent Hanan grid lines. <p> is O (n 3 ), and the total complexity of the step is O (kn 3 ), where k is the number of candidate root points (at worst O (n 2 )). 15 If we use a faster A-Tree heuristic such as a variation of that by Rao et al. <ref> [22] </ref>, the complexity of each A-tree construction is reduced to O (nlog n).
