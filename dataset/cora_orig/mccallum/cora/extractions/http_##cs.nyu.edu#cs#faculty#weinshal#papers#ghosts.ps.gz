Abstract: I have studied particular ambiguous random dot stereograms where multiple matches (that are equally possible) are available at each point. The human visual system resolves these ambiguities in two qualitatively different ways. In some cases a few transparent surfaces are perceived corresponding to all the ambiguous matches. In other cases a single dominant opaque surface is perceived. The conditions under which each behavior occurs are described. Additional experiments, designed to explore whether a number of modified stereo matching algorithms can predict human perception, are described, and their theoretical implications are discussed. keywords: binocular vision, matching, uniqueness, smoothness, multiple matching, double nail illusion, disparity gradient.

Reference-contexts: Most of the existing stereo algorithms, as well as most of the theories of human stereo vision, incorporate these two constraints, e.g. Marr and Poggio (1979), Mayhew and Frisby (1981), Nishihara (1984). <ref> [7, 8, 9, 6] </ref> The double-nail illusion (Krol and van de Grind (1980))[5] illustrates the use of these constraints by human stereo vision. In figure 1, the two bars in the left image can be matched to the two bars in the right image in four different ways.

Reference-contexts: Obviously 0 should support 0, but 0 may not support -2 if the algorithm restricts support when the difference in disparities is large. To implement this idea, Pollard and Frisby (1990) used their PMF matching algorithm (Pollard et al., 1985 <ref> [10] </ref>) with disparity-gradient limit 0.5. The performance of the modified algorithm agrees with human perception for both experiments 1 and 2 (see figure 13b,d).
