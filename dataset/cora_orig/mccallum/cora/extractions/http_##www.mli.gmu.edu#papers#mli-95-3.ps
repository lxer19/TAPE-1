Abstract: The East-West Challenge is the title of the second international competition of machine learning programs, organized in the Fall 1994 by Donald Michie, Stephen Muggleton, David Page and Ashwin Srinivasan from Oxford University. The goal of the competition was to solve the TRAINS problems, that is to discover the simplest classification rules for train-like structured objects. The rule complexity was judged by a Prolog program that counted the number of various components in the rule expressed in the from of Prolog Horn clauses. There were 65 entries from several countries submitted to the competition. The GMU teams entry was generated by three members of the AQ family of learning programs: AQ-DT, INDUCE and AQ17-HCI. The paper analyses the results obtained by these programs and compares them to those obtained by other learning programs. It also presents ideas for further research that were inspired by the competition. One of these ideas is a challenge to the machine learning community to develop a measure of knowledge complexity that would adequately capture the cognitive complexity of knowledge. A preliminary measure of such cognitive complexity, called Ccomplexity, different from the Prolog-complexity (P-complexity) used in the competition, is briefly discussed. The authors thank Professors Donald Michie, Steve Muggleton, David Page and Ashwin Srinivasan for organizing the West-East Challenge competition of machine learning programs, which provided us with a stimulating challenge for our learning programs and inspired new ideas for improving them. The authors also thank Nabil Allkharouf and Ali Hadjarian for their help and suggestions in the efforts to solve problems posed by the competition. This research was conducted in the Center for Machine Learning and Inference at George Mason University.

Reference-contexts: There is a tremendous number of classification rules that are complete and consistent with the given training example set in each problem. (If the data contained noise, the best solutions may not be consitent and/or complete with regard to the input examples <ref> (Bergadano 7 et al., 1992) </ref>. An important issue then is how to decide which of the many logically acceptable solutions is the most desirable. This calls for some metric for evaluating solutions. The nature of the domain often has an impact on the ranking of rules.

Reference-contexts: Inductive logic programming is therefore a particularly suitable approach to such problems. The original TRAINS problem was first proposed by R.S. Michalski over 20 years ago, and was used to test the INDUCE program for learning structural descriptions <ref> (Michalski, 1980) </ref>. 2.

Applying AQ Programs to West-East Challenge 3.1 General Comments The MLI research team applied three programs from the AQ family: AQDT (Michalski & Imam, 1994), INDUCE <ref> (Hoff, Michalski & Stepp, 1980) </ref> and AQ17-HCI (Wnek & Michalski, 1994b) to the problems of the competition. The programs and results obtained from their application are briefly described in the following sections.

Reference-contexts: The trains have a variable number of cars; cars are of different shapes and can carry different loads. A natural characterization of such structures requires a language for representing relational descriptions, such as first order predicate logic or annotated predicate calculus <ref> (Michalski, 1983) </ref>. Inductive logic programming is therefore a particularly suitable approach to such problems. The original TRAINS problem was first proposed by R.S. Michalski over 20 years ago, and was used to test the INDUCE program for learning structural descriptions (Michalski, 1980). 2.

AQDT-2 System 4.1 Program description The AQDT-2 system <ref> (Michalski & Imam, 1994) </ref> learns task-oriented decision structures from decision rules or from examples. This approach was motivated by the need to build a learning and discovery system able not only to generate and store knowledge, but also to use it effectively for decision making.

AQ17-HCI 6.1 The Method The AQ17-HCI system implements the AQ-HCI method for combining an inductive rule learning algorithm with a hypothesis-driven constructive induction (HCI) procedure for iteratively transforming a representation space <ref> (Wnek & Michalski, 1994b) </ref>. In each iteration, the method changes the representation space by adding new attributes determined on the basis of detected patterns, and removing insufficiently relevant attributes. The quality of the hypothesis generated in each iteration is evaluated by applying the hypothesis to a subset of training examples.

Reference-contexts: Initial research on this approach, and the first system implementation, AQDT-1, is described in (Imam & Michalski, 1993). AQDT-2 generates a goal-oriented decision structure from examples or decision rules learned by either the AQ15c <ref> (Wnek et al., 1995) </ref> or AQ17 (Bloedorn, et al, 1992) rule learning system, the latter of which has extensive constructive induction capabilities. 4.2 Problem Formulation Because the examples in the train problems were originally described in terms of Prolog clauses, it was necessary to translate these clauses into representations suitable for
