Abstract: A systematic comparison is carried out between some standard finite difference schemes, regarding their costs and dispersion properties. To be more specific, given a precision threshold to be imposed on the velocity error and a finite difference scheme, it is possible to determine a time-step and a grid-spacing in an optimal manner, i.e. so as to minimize the computational cost. Using this optimal cost as a criterion, it becomes easy to single out the most economical scheme for the purpose of a synthetic seismic campaign. This survey represents the preliminary part of the larger project Marmousi 3-D, the purpose of which is to create a synthetic database corresponding to one-parameter media. In this paper, one's attention is focused on the 2-2m family of schemes. Since both homogeneous and heteregenous cases are investigated, the study is expected to provide realistic figures for future simulations.

Reference-contexts: This discrepancy in velocity is all the more noticeable as the propagation time is long.

For a given propagation time, it is always possible to lessen the effects of dispersion by choosing smaller values for the sampling intervals.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The use of numerical methods to produce synthetic seismograms dates back to the seventies with the paper by Kelly et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. Undeniably, its advantage over other traditional approaches like asymptotic expansion or Kirchhoff integral is that by directly dealing with the acoustic wave equation, it takes into account all physical phenomena.

The key feature which accounts for this situation lies in the number of elementary operations of the schemes, which implies that the greatest attention should be paid to the family of schemes under study. 20 W.
