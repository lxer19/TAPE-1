Abstract: We have analyzed characteristics of sharable resources and developed techniques for intelligently sharing resourcesspecifically, communication channelsamong agents in multiagent systems. Our techniques allow agents to nearly optimize their communication behavior in a self-organizing and distributed fashion, involving the use of a microeconomic pricing system based on economic laws of supply and demand and trading among agents in real-time. Our analyses are based on three measures of performance: fairness of resource allocation, waiting time for resources, and utilization of resources. Our initial analysis indicates that fairness and utilization are conflicting, in that the best utilization with a fair allocation is equivalent to the worst utilization with an unfair resource allocation, assuming the allocation policy is statically defined. To strike a balance in performance, we have developed mechanisms that establish an artificial economy, where agents can dynamically reallocate goods (resource access) using a competitive market pricing mechanism. However, unlike more common market-oriented methods, our approach does not demand convergence to equilibrium, but permits more rapid, heuristic trading, leading to near optimal performance where both buyers and sellers of resources can benefit. Our studies show that agents employing our mechanisms can dramatically improve utilization while still providing fair access to the resources.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, mobile robots that use similar active sensors (such as sonar) could be confused by crosstalk (sensing others' signals) unless they somehow avoid the simultaneous use of their sensing resources <ref> (Kortenkamp, Huber, Koss, Lee, Wu, Belding, Bidlack, and Rodgers 1994) </ref>. In essence, then, the problem we must address is how agents might make intelligent decisions about the use of shared resources such that each can have a better chance of using the resources when they are really needed.

Reference-contexts: Second, our analysis here is based on interactions between two agents, for simplicity. With more agents, the trading heuristics will become more complex, but the underlying philosophy will continue applying. Third, in highly competitive settings, protocols for revealing less information, or that enforce truthful revelation <ref> (Rosenschein and Zlotkin 1994) </ref>, must augment or replace the BCM information exchange presented here.

Reference-contexts: More specifically, the domain we are exploring involves port-based communications and ppersistent CSMA protocols <ref> (Tanenbaum 1981) </ref> with multiple channels with different communication delays. In this domain, agent a has ports 1 to N connected to the corresponding ports of agent b . When an agent becomes ready to send, it senses the channel. If the channel is idle, the agent transmits with probability p. <p> This process is repeated until either the message has been transmitted or another agent has begun transmitting. For our analyses, we further assume that: (1) all messages are of constant length; (2) there are no errors except those caused by collisions; (3) there is no capture effect <ref> (Tanenbaum 1981) </ref>, so a collision leads to the loss of all colliding messages; and (4) the state of the channel can be sensed instantaneously. 2.1 The Need to Trade Resource Access At first, let us consider only one channel shared by two agents, agent a and agent b . <p> Using the simulation program, we have been testing the correctness of our algorithms and analyzing the pricing and trading heuristics. We are also planning to conduct comparative experiments with other knowledge-poor, systematic approaches such as the simple turn-taking method and the binary exponential backoff protocol heuristic <ref> (Tanenbaum 1981) </ref>. Such comparative experiments have proven problematic because of the many communication parameters that need to be specified, including message generation characteristics, message utilities and deadlines, channel service rates, etc.
