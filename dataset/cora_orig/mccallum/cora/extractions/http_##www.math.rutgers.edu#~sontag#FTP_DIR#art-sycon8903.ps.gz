Abstract: Report SYCON-89-03 ABSTRACT This note presents an explicit proof of the theorem -due to Artstein- which states that the existence of a smooth control-Lyapunov function implies smooth stabilizability. More- over, the result is extended to the real-analytic and rational cases as well. The proof uses a "universal" formula given by an algebraic function of Lie derivatives; this formula originates in the solution of a simple Riccati equation.

Reference-contexts: More relevant to the topic of this paper, it was shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that if there is a clf, smooth as above, then there must be a feedback law u = k (x); k (0) = 0; which globally stabilizes the system and which is smooth on IR n In general k may fail to be smooth everywhere, but under certain conditions, which <p> the existence of a weak kind of Lipschitz feedback is in fact equivalent to the existence of smooth feedback), and the result is true for general multi-input systems, not necessarily affine in controls, provided that one allows a certain type of "chattering" feedback law; for details the reader should consult <ref> [1] </ref>. Perhaps more importantly, his partition of unity construction permits dealing with arbitrary closed control value sets.

Reference-contexts: conditions are necessary as well as sufficient, the necessity following from the by now standard Lyapunov function inverse theorems due to Massera, Zubov, Kurzweil and others.) Allowing nonsmoothness at the origin was emphasized in [9], and has since been recognized as desirable by many authors (see e.g. [10], [4], and <ref> [2] </ref>, the first of which in particular also proved a version of Artstein's theorem). From the point of view of Lyapunov techniques, this is more natural than global smoothness, because it can be characterized precisely in terms of Lyapunov functions.

Reference-contexts: The general theory is surveyed in [7], and the result in the smooth and analytic cases is 3 due to Delchamps (see for instance <ref> [3] </ref>), but in this very simple case (the family is one-- dimensional), the construction of k can be carried out directly without explicit recourse to the general result. Indeed, one can show directly that the following feedback law: k := p b works.

In [8] we showed that in general it is desirable to study a somewhat different, and more "robust" problem than stabilization, namely the problem of input to state stabilization.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show that the existence of such a clf implies that the system is asymptotically controllable (from any state one can asymptotically reach the origin); in the paper <ref> [6] </ref> we showed that the existence of a clf is in fact also necessary if there is asymptotic controllability, provided that one does not require smoothness (in which case equation (2) must be replaced by an equation involving Dini derivatives).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this k can be chosen to be analytically or rationally dependent if the original family is, that is, if the original system and clf are. The general theory is surveyed in <ref> [7] </ref>, and the result in the smooth and analytic cases is 3 due to Delchamps (see for instance [3]), but in this very simple case (the family is one-- dimensional), the construction of k can be carried out directly without explicit recourse to the general result. <p> Then (x; 1 kxk 2 ) 2 T , so (6) holds and the proof is complete.

For completeness, we provide here a precise statement and proof.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [8] </ref> we showed that in general it is desirable to study a somewhat different, and more "robust" problem than stabilization, namely the problem of input to state stabilization. <p> To be more accurate, a mild technical condition is needed for the result in <ref> [8] </ref>, which in this case becomes the assumption that lim a 2 + fi 2 = 1 : If this would not hold, that reference shows how to slightly modify the construction. 11
