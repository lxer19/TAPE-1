Abstract: Previous work has described teleporting, an approach to mobile computing in which it is the user's personal application environment which is mobile rather than the hardware on which the applications run. In this paper we describe an extended teleporting system which makes the user's environment available on any machine in the world running a Java-compliant web browser. We present some preliminary experimental results together with discussions of security and performance issues.

Reference-contexts: JavaTel is a step in that direction insofar as it makes available on virtually any internet-connected machine a computing environment completely determined by the user. Another X-based architecture for mobile applications on the web is presented in <ref> [3] </ref> together with a good overview and analysis of the central issues in designing such an architecture. The approach taken is similar to ours, although it relies on X on the browser side as well as the application side.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps this can be achieved by designing browsers which interpret web documents and applets in ways suitable to these different devices, as is apparently the thrust of Netscape's Navio Communications venture. Such an approach has been mooted elsewhere, e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>, although typically without the wide range of computing devices which we have in mind.
