Abstract: Five things have to happen for a planar bipedal robot to walk. Height has to be stabilized. Pitch has to be stabilized. Speed has to be stabilized. The swing leg has to move so that the feet are in locations which allow for the stability of height, pitch, and speed. Finally, transitions from support leg to support leg must occur at appropriate times. If these five objectives are achieved, the robot will walk. A number of different intuitive control strategies can be used to achieve each of these five objectives. Further, each strategy can be implemented in a variety of ways. We present several strategies for each objective which we have implemented on a bipedal walking robot. Using these simple intuitive strategies, we have compelled a seven link planar bipedal robot, called Spring Flamingo, to walk. The robot walks both slowly and quickly, walks over moderate obstacles, starts, and stops. Video, photographs, and more information on Spring Flamingo can be found at http://www.leglab.ai.mit.edu/

Reference-contexts: All of Spring Flamingo's motors are located in its upper body, with power being transmitted to the joints via cable drives. Series Elastic Actuation <ref> [11] </ref> is employed at each degree of freedom, allowing for accurate application of torques and a high degree of shock tolerance. The maximum torque that can be applied to the hips and ankles is approximately 18 Nm, while approximately 24 Nm can be applied to the knees.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe intuitive control strategies which can be used to meet these five objectives and hence compel a robot to walk. We describe how these control strategies can be implemented with Virtual Model Control <ref> [12] </ref>, a robot control language which itself appeals to intuition. We introduce a simple technique, called the "virtual toe point" constraint for dealing with feet and actuated ankles. The virtual toe point is the point along the foot at which zero torques are commanded. <p> A simple method which does not require high gain feedback is to push upwardly on the body a little harder than gravity. This will cause the robot to increase its height until the knee hits its joint limit (knee cap). The first strategy was used with Spring Turkey <ref> [12] </ref>, our previous walking robot. We successfully applied both strategies on Spring Flamingo but embraced the second one because it is much more efficient and more similar to biological walking. By walking with fully extended legs, there is a low torque requirement on the knee. <p> We used the first strategy in the control of Spring Flamingo. 3 Virtual Actuator Implementation for a Planar Biped With Feet and Ankles We use Virtual Actuators [13] and Virtual Model Control <ref> [12] </ref>, two techniques based on intuition, to implement some of the strategies of the previous section. <p> This insight in turn helps speed up the tuning process. We are currently investigating the possibility of using learning or adaptive techniques to tune the parameters automatically. Spring Flamingo gained several advantages over Spring Turkey <ref> [12] </ref> by the use of feet and actuated ankles. Since Spring Turkey had only point feet, it could not balance on one foot, had to walk with bent knees, and had large velocity fluctuations during each stride.

Reference-contexts: We used the first strategy in the control of Spring Flamingo. 3 Virtual Actuator Implementation for a Planar Biped With Feet and Ankles We use Virtual Actuators <ref> [13] </ref> and Virtual Model Control [12], two techniques based on intuition, to implement some of the strategies of the previous section. <p> In this section we present the mathematics to implement virtual components on Spring Flamingo for the support leg in single support or both legs in double support, following the procedure described in <ref> [13] </ref>. 3.1 Single Leg Implementation serial robot model that we use to represent a single leg of our walking robot. The toe joint and link do not exist on the real robot (Figure 2). They are used to represent the point on the foot in which no torque is applied. <p> Here we examine the double support case. As in <ref> [13] </ref> we could construct a constraint matrix and exactly solve for the force distribution between the two legs such that any arbitrary F x ; F z ; F force vector could be commanded.

Reference-contexts: Add the I (Integral) term and the controller keeps pushing harder and harder in the direction of the error until it finally goes away. Raibert's hoppers use a simple 3-part intuitive controller <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We introduce a simple technique, called the "virtual toe point" constraint for dealing with feet and actuated ankles. The virtual toe point is the point along the foot at which zero torques are commanded. This is similar to a static version of the zero moment point <ref> [16] </ref>. The virtual toe point constraint prevents the foot from over-rotating due to high ankle torques, while allowing the robot to go up on its toes in order to get an extended range of motion from the rear leg. <p> They are used to represent the point on the foot in which no torque is applied. We refer to this as the "virtual toe point". It is similar to the center of pressure on the foot or the zero moment point <ref> [16] </ref> except that it is a commanded quantity, not a measured one, and is based on static, not dynamic, considerations. The virtual toe point can be used for control in the following intuitive sense.
