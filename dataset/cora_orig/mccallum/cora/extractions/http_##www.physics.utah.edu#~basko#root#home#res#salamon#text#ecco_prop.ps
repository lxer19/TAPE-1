Reference-contexts: We confirm the low abundance of Pb measured by previous efforts, but with complete separation of Pb from the Pt-group. Our measurements are strongly inconsistent with the widely-held model of GCR origin in which GCR nuclei originate in the chromospheres of sun-like stars <ref> [7] </ref>, that is, our data are not consistent with a solar-like source with preferential acceleration of elements with low First Ionization Potential (the so-called "FIP bias"). <p> We show predicted abundances for: a young source ("rp"), as implied by the r-process enhancement model of Binns et al.[18]; a source of contemporary galactic composition ("lg"), as implied by the model of Meyer, Ellison, and Drury [11]; and an old source ("ss"), corresponding to material from preferentially late-type stars <ref> [7] </ref>. The bold box shows the expected confidence limits due to statistics, assuming a measured composition marked by the "+"; the dashed line shows the 1 upper limit expected if no Pu are observed. Both U/Th and Pu/Th readily distinguish between models.

Reference-contexts: The source composition was determined by maximum likelihood ( 2 = 39:2 with 39 d.o.f.). Most Ir decays to Pt and most Tl to Pb immediately after acceleration due to bound-state beta decay <ref> [23] </ref>, so the observed abundances of each pair are highly correlated; this causes a numerical instability in the derivation of source abundances. <p> A particularly interesting case is Ir. It turns out that in Nature there are precisely four isotopes which are completely or effectively stable as neutron atoms, but which can decay as fully or partially stripped ions. These isotopes, the bound-state fidecay (BSfiD) isotopes <ref> [23] </ref>, are fi emitters, but their Q-value is so small that they cannot emit the electron into the continuum. However, the electron may be emitted into a bound electronic state, if such a bound state is available.

This has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the predicted production of Pb by the r-process. Unfortunately, this revision has led to predictions of Hg and Pb production by both the r-process enhancement model and the grain-sputtering model which strongly overlap.

There properties are very unlikely to be different at the actinides; however, it is worthwhile to verify them using a 1 A GeV U beam at GSI. We plan to perform this test under this grant.
