Abstract: This paper describes a divide-and-conquer strategy for solving block Hessenberg systems. For dense matrices the method is a little more efficient than Gaussian elimination; however, because it works almost entirely with the original blocks, it is be much more efficient for sparse matrices or matrices whose blocks can be generated on the fly. For Toeplitz matrices, the algorithm can be combined with the fast Fourier transform to give a new superfast algorithm. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: Thus the problem of computing the product A ne x has been reduced to computing and summing the products C ij x j . Now the product of a Toelplitz matrix of order m and a vector can be computed in O (m log 2 m) <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. For definiteness let us say that it requires Km log 2 m operations. Hence we can compute the product A ne x s with Kp 2 m log 2 m operations.
