Abstract: We model an ATM virtual circuit as a tandem queueing system. At each queue, transmission of the virtual circuit traffic is interrupted by cross traffic, causing the scattering and coalescing of cells. We study this phenomenon using entropy as a traffic descriptor. We compute the entropy of traffic streams produced in simulation, via an estimation technique based on the Lempel-Ziv universal data compression method. The estimator modifies the Lempel-Ziv method to compute entropy rather than compress data. We show that the entropy of virtual circuit traffic at successive queues can either increase or decrease depending upon the types of input traffic. Even when bursty input is scattered, its entropy does not achieve maximum entropy within a reasonable number of queues. We also define a distance metric to compare the correlation structures of two output processes and observe this metric at successive queue outputs.

Reference-contexts: The compression ratio is given by the ratio of the length of the compressed string over the length of the original string. It is well known that the LZ algorithm asymptotically achieves a compression ratio proportional to the entropy of the dataset <ref> [3] </ref>. We are thus motivated to use LZ to determine the entropy of a dataset. The basic LZ method, and the variations on LZ compression, when used to compute entropy rather than compress data suffer from large error terms that are a function of the size of the dataset. <p> The entropy descriptor is one dimensional and also captures, although indirectly, frequently occurring patterns in traffic streams. However the entropy descriptor is limited in that different underlying traffic distributions can generate the same entropy. 3 Entropy We briefly review some basic definitions. (For a full coverage see <ref> [3] </ref>.) The entropy is a measure of the uncertainty of a random variable. <p> For a stationary Markov chain, the entropy rate is given by H (X i =X i1 ), or H (X 2 =X 1 ). Theorem 4.2.4 in <ref> [3] </ref> states that for a stationary Markov chain, fX i g, with stationary distribution and transition matrix P , the entropy rate is X i P ij log P ij (2) Using equation (1) the entropy of a Bernoulli traffic source with load p is given by H (p) = p

Reference-contexts: We study properties of these departure processes, but the main focus is on their entropy. The system we consider, with Q queues in tandem, is depicted in Figure 1. We use G/D/1-FIFO queues to represent network devices <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Each queue has two input classes. Input class 1 carries through traffic and input class 2 carries cross traffic. Each cross traffic stream enters a particular queue and departs the system after service by that queue.

Reference-contexts: Alternative traffic descriptors, such as peak-to-mean ratio of clusters of cells, are very sensitive to the time interval over which the peak and mean sizes are calculated <ref> [6] </ref>, and thus cannot serve as descriptors of "intrinsic" traffic properties. We discuss traffic descriptors further in x2. Since we do not know the underlying joint distributions of the queue departure processes, we cannot compute the entropy analytically.

They find conditions under which the distortion is negligible and the output is practically the same as the input process. Ohba et al. <ref> [7] </ref> find the stationary distribution for the interdeparture intervals of through traffic streams. Their description assumes that successive departure instants are independent. <p> In both cases, this data indicates that the average queue process is sensitive to the amount of correlation in the cross traffic (the load is the same in all tests). One of the results in <ref> [7] </ref> shows that average queue sizes decrease in successive queues. Our results demonstrate that actually average queue sizes can increase or decrease with successive queues depending upon the types of input traffic.
