Abstract: We present protocol extensions supporting real-time traffic performance guarantees for Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) implementations lacking a synchronous mode of operation. We provide a brief description of the FDDI protocol, with an emphasis on the synchronous mode and network parameter tuning to meet real-time application demands, and then discuss hardware limitations of some first-generation FDDI adapters which make the synchronous mode ineffective and unable to support the required performance guarantees. By modifying the operating system kernel we can regulate the flow of information to the FDDI adapters and implement guarantees in higher-level software. Specifically, we added a two-tiered regulation facility which, at the lowest level, would place an upper bound on asynchronous transmission rate from the device driver buffers to the adapter. The next level up added the notion of standard and guaranteed performance system queues which user - level traffic could be directed into. Finally, a distributed user-level software mechanism was added to monitor and appropriately regulate the throughput from each adapter on the LAN in response to varying bandwidth requirements.

Introduction The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is an American National Standard <ref> [1] </ref>, for a 100 Mb/s ring-based Local Area Network (LAN) architecture utilizing a This research has been supported by Digital Equipment Corporation and the UC MICRO program.

Reference-contexts: FDDI was designed as a second generation, highspeed LAN with parameters that are now considered appropriate for Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), e.g., covering distances of up to 100 Km. A good overview of FDDI can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The FDDI protocol combines the statistical multiplexing capabilities of packetswitching with the guaranteed performance features of circuitswitching. In particular, the FDDI timed token rotation protocol provides support for two types of traffic: synchronous and asynchronous .

Reference-contexts: Parameter tuning and the resulting performance of FDDI is discussed extensively in <ref> [3] </ref>. Proofs for the performance guarantees provided and related timing properties of FDDI are presented in [4] and [5]. Unfortunately, the synchronous mode of FDDI is considered an optional feature by manufacturers and it is not implemented in most FDDI equipment.

Reference-contexts: In addition, a synchronous bandwidth allocation (SBA) mechanism and network-wide manager were designed and implemented, the definitions of which are hinted at in the FDDI Station Management (SMT) proposed protocol standard <ref> [6] </ref>, yet left unspecified. To that end a distributed user-level software mechanism was added to monitor and appropriately regulate the throughput from each adapter on the LAN in response to varying bandwidth requirements.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the SMT standard leaves the SBA manager selection scheme totally unspecified. Note that SMT protocols, e.g., neighbor identification, synchronous bandwidth reservation, etc., use asynchronous transmissions. Agrawal et al. <ref> [7] </ref> present and analyze several synchronous bandwidth allocation schemes. During the bidding for T_Opr individual stations would bid a TTRT equal to half their desired CAT (so that the chosen T_Opr would satisfy their CAT requirement). FDDI parameter configuration is then straightforward and requires the following three steps.

Reference-contexts: Simulation Results In order to evaluate the performance limitations of the SingleQueueAdapter model, and demonstrate the operational characteristics of the OracleScheme , a symbol-level FDDI simulator was developed <ref> [8] </ref>. The following simulation results demonstrate the real-time traffic guarantees provided by the OracleScheme in relation to the synchronous mode service provided by StandardFDDI . To provide a fair comparison of the capabilities of each model, simulations were run using the same supplied traffic.

Reference-contexts: The former is identical to the original socket (2) call with the addition of two new parameters specifying the maximum number of bytes sent per access, and the maximum acceptable CAT (in milliseconds). See <ref> [9] </ref> for further details and examples. Incorporating adapter starvation and the OracleScheme into an existing asynchronous-only FDDI implementation required the following modifications. <p> A program must make a system call to explicitly set the flag, at which point all subsequent output will be routed through the faster queue. See <ref> [9] </ref> for a more detailed treatment of the modifications. 6. Conclusions Lack of support for real-time traffic guarantees is becoming a major stumbling block in the evolution of interactive, time critical network applications.
