Abstract: In this paper, we describe a temporal deontic logic that facilitates reasoning about obligations and deadlines. The logic is an extension of deontic dynamic logic, in which only immediate obligations can be specified. In our extension, we can also specify that an obligation starts at a certain time or event, that it must be done immediately, as soon as possible, before a deadline, or periodically. A practical application area are intelligent agents that must be able to reason about their agendas.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we take a different approach. We actually "add" the temporal operators to the deontic logic that is used as a basis. The formulas defined in (7) define the "classical" deontic formulas as introduced by v.Wright in <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. Finally, the formulas defined in (8) introduce a preference relation between actions. They state which action is preferred to be performed at a certain time. We assume a fixed set Prop of atomic propositions and sets Act and Tract of action expressions and transaction expressions respectively (see below).

Reference-contexts: To keep the logic as simple as possible the temporal operators only reach over action expressions and not over transaction expressions. The semantics of (trans)action expressions has two components. The first component is an algebra of uninterpreted actions (called a uniform semantics elsewhere <ref> [3] </ref>), which allows us to interpret equalities between action expressions without taking their effect into account. In the algebraic semantics, each action expression will be interpreted as a choice over possible steps. Due to a lack of space we refer to [7] for a formal account of this part.

Reference-contexts: For a thorough treatment of this type of logic we refer to <ref> [4] </ref>. Here we take the preference relation to be primitive. R O is the deontic relation that with respect to a state oe reached by trace fl indicates the ideal situation consisting of state oe 0 and trace fl 0 .

Reference-contexts: Although parameterized actions were not explicitly introduced in this paper, we use them in the examples in order to get a more realistic representation. The formal introduction of parameterized actions can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. The second example shows some combinations of different types of deadlines. After the stock of computers has fallen below 10 an order should be made before the stock is less than 6. If an order has been made the delivery should follow within 5 days.

Reference-contexts: In the algebraic semantics, each action expression will be interpreted as a choice over possible steps. Due to a lack of space we refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for a formal account of this part. Most important is that we have a formal semantics for the negation of (trans)actions as well. Informally the semantics of a (trans)action ff ([[ff]]) is given as a set of traces.

Reference-contexts: We will use this feature to define obligations on actions shortly. It should be noted that using the semantic definition of [any]OE we can express the usual temporal operators over static formulas as given in e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>. Points (7) and (8) define extra temporal operators reaching over action expressions! Point (9) defines what it means that one action is preferred over another action. Before we give a definition of the deontic operators in the next section, we will introduce a helpful operator.

Reference-contexts: The formulas defined in (5) involve a variant on the standard dynamic logic definition of the consequence of (trans)actions. The formulas defined in (6) all involve some type of temporal operations on actions. Allthough more approaches exist that combine temporal and deontic logics (e.g. <ref> [13, 11, 9] </ref>) these approaches tend to express the deontic concepts in terms of the temporal operators. In this paper we take a different approach. We actually "add" the temporal operators to the deontic logic that is used as a basis. <p> It resembles the "liveness" property as described in <ref> [9] </ref>, except that the obligated action cannot be postponed indefinite. It has to be performed before an action with lesser importance is performed. The last type of obligation that we will describe is the periodic obligation.

Reference-contexts: This language is a variant of dynamic logic ([10]), and was first used for this purpose in <ref> [12] </ref>. In the present paper we add a few "new" formulas to this language.
