Title: Retrieval Schedules Based on Resource Availibility and Flexible Presentation Specifications  
Author: K. Sel~cuk Candan B. Prabhakaran V.S. Subrahmanian 
Abstract: A distributed multimedia document presentation involves retrieval of objects from one or more document servers and their presentation at the client system. The presentation of the multimedia objects has to be carried out in accordance with the specification of temporal relationships between the objects. The retrieval of multimedia objects from the document server(s) is influenced by factors such as : temporal specification of objects presentations, throughput offered by the network service provider, and the buffer resources on the client system. Flexi- bility in the temporal specification of the multimedia document may help in deriving an object retrieval schedule that can handle variations in network throughput and buffer resource availability. In this paper, we develop techniques for deriving a flexible object retrieval schedule for a distributed multimedia document presentation. The schedule is based on flexible temporal specification of the multimedia document using the difference constraints approach. We show how the derived retrieval schedule can be validated and modified to ensure that it can work with the offered network throughput and the available buffer resources.

Suppose D is any document and T D is the set of temporal constraints associated with D.

Reference-contexts: The time available for presentation depends on the derived presentation schedule from the (flexible) temporal constraints specification. The retrieval schedule for a multimedia document presentation has to be derived based on the above four constraints. Related Work: Multimedia authoring and presentation schedule creation have been studied by many researchers <ref> [2, 5, 15, 16, 18, 19, 25] </ref>. Similarly, derivation of retrieval schedules for distributed multimedia presentation has also been studied in many works, such as [18, 16, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34]. In [18], the presentation schedule is based on Petri nets description of the temporal specification. <p> This specification includes, amongst other things, the temporal constraints used to generate the presentation.

Our approach is to use flexible temporal constraint specifications for deriving a possible presentation schedule <ref> [5] </ref>. Based on this presentation schedule, we suggest techniques for deriving the retrieval schedule. The derived retrieval schedule is validated by checking whether it satisfies all the system availability constraints. If it does not, we do the following: 1. Modify the retrieval schedule.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that solving a set of difference constraints is equivalent to finding the shortest path in the graph associated with those constraints <ref> [6] </ref>. The constraint graphs may contain edges with negative weights. As an example, consider the following constraint specification. 12 Example 2 Assume the following set of specifications: (1a) a b 0 (2a) b a 1 Here, (1a)-(2a), and (1a)-(3a)-(4a) are in conflict. <p> Similarly, finding priority-optimal removals is solvable in polynomial time. Presentation Schedule Generation Algorithms : Though most graph algorithms for computing shortest paths cannot handle negative edges in the graph, the well known Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm can deal with negative edges <ref> [6] </ref>. If there is no negative cycle, the algorithm produces the shortest paths and their weights. The shortest path along with the associated weights specify, in effect, the start times and durations of presentations of the objects composing the multimedia document.
