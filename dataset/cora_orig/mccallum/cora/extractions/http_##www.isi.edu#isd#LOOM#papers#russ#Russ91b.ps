Reference-contexts: Decision 4. This Advisor's decision was probably faulted for a combination of a potassium recommendation and its recommendation of a higher infusion rate for intravenous fluids. The potassium recommendation follows the aggressive rule derived from Alberti and Hockaday <ref> [1] </ref>. The fluid rule can be attributed to the deficit-estimation problem. The Advisor does not modify the deficit estimate based on other clinical signs. Since three liters of fluid were infused, blood pressure had risen, and pulse had dropped, the patient was most likely no longer dehydrated.

Reference-contexts: Although I had to add other parts to the Ketoacidosis Advisor, the work on dosage adjustment proved to be a good starting point for my own subcutaneous insulin adjustment algorithms. Like <ref> [2, 77] </ref>, I applied a computerized process to the implemetation of what were originally "paper" algorithms based on Skyler's work [81]. 8.3.2 Ventilation Manager The Ventilation Manager program vm [28] is the work most closely related to this thesis.

These systems provide a strict definition of temporal intervals and an algebra for manipulating them. This allows reasoning about the relationships among distinct intervals, for example, the determination of whether they overlap or not.

Reference-contexts: This allows reasoning about the relationships among distinct intervals, for example, the determination of whether they overlap or not. An application of this that is being pursued by Allen is the use of this algebra in planning <ref> [6] </ref>. It is interesting that there is a desire to avoid having both points and intervals together because that would destroy mathematical purity and introduce difficulties in interpretation.

Reference-contexts: These systems use data from several days of observations to adjust the regular insulin dosage of the patients. The degree of modelling varies from the simple [21] to the more complicated <ref> [9] </ref>. There are other data analysis systems that seek to identify trends in the data and detect when changes in regimens have taken place [38]. The Ketoacidosis Advisor differs in having to assimilate more types of data in a more dynamic environment.

Reference-contexts: I discuss blackboard architectures for decision-making and special languages and hardware architectures for real-time expert systems. 8.4.1 Blackboard Systems Blackboard systems <ref> [61, 62, 12] </ref> consist of a central database (the blackboard) that is shared by several independent reasoning units (knowledge sources). Each knowledge source (KS) is an independent unit which communicates with other units through messages placed in a commonly understood format on the blackboard.

Reference-contexts: This value is a little lower than would have been chosen in the absence of the desire to coordinate the two measuring systems, but it is consistent with published guidelines <ref> [15, 20] </ref>. Although it would involve more complicated programs, separate thresholds could be used, with appropriate safeguards to prevent "thrashing" between recommendations in the event that the two types of tests alternated.

Reference-contexts: A tms constrains the types of inference used to some specific method. Doyle's original tms system [23] used the presence or absence of specific nodes to determine the validity or lack of validity of a given result. Other organizational principles also exist in Doyle's and de Kleer's <ref> [16] </ref> systems, but the basic framework and system architecture are the same.

Reference-contexts: The use of such persistence modules is quite common in tcs-based systems. It also forms the core of reasoning in Dean's Time Map Manager <ref> [17, 19] </ref>. Returning to the pharmacokinetic example used above, it is clear that the simulation program, once started, could in principle (and very easily in programming 24 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: Tcs provides only the simplest form of persistence, namely the extension of data values for a fixed period of validity. Other researchers have investigated the deeper relation between causation and the notion of persistence that this simple model captures <ref> [18] </ref>, as well as having proposed more rigorous models of the probalistic nature of the resulting interval value [34]. In the experiments I have conducted so far, the simple approach used by tcs has been adequate. The expansion of the time covered can occur in both directions.

Returning to the pharmacokinetic example used above, it is clear that the simulation program, once started, could in principle (and very easily in programming 24 CHAPTER 2. REASONING MODEL practice as well!) calculate the serum concentration out to infinity. <p> The tractibility of the Time Map Manager's contradiction resolution algorithm depends on the absence of time-limiting constraints on the extent of persistences <ref> [19, Rule 3, p. 45] </ref>. 4.3. ABSTRACTORS 47 The internal execution time function f x must partition the initial execution interval into smaller pieces, each of which can be handled by f v and f s . <p> This provides a second indexing method for database query answering. The propagation method they use requires time to be a symbolic interval, so it is not able to handle metric information. Time Map Manager Dean and McDermott <ref> [19] </ref> have constructed a temporal extension of a tms system called a Time Map Manager. This augments a conventional tms with special constructs for handling the temporal extent of propositions. Time maps are designed to assist a reasoning program doing planning with time constraints.

Reference-contexts: The function of the tms is to guarantee a consistent state of the database. This type of architecture is shown 8.2. TRUTH MAINTENANCE 109 in figure 8.1a. The user program's decision units manipulate the tms database. A system based on this paradigm is described by Dhar <ref> [22] </ref>, in which he builds his domain-specific constraint satisfaction code on top of McAllester's tms package. The tms system is the substrate that is manipulated by a constraint-satisfaction problem-solver.

Reference-contexts: The action that a programmer wishes a reasoning system to take is usually fairly straightforward. 8.2 Truth Maintenance The idea of a Truth Maintenance System (tms) can trace its roots to the dependency-directed backtracking and constraint-propagation work of Stallman and Sussman [83]. This work was extended by Doyle <ref> [23] </ref> and McAllester [57]. The central idea was that a more efficient recovery from errors or false assumptions could be made by keeping a record of the dependencies among conclusions. This introduced intelligence into what had been a blind backtracking approach. <p> The tcs does not make any assumptions about the nature of the inference method that is used, and is therefore able to accommodate a wider range of methods. A tms constrains the types of inference used to some specific method. Doyle's original tms system <ref> [23] </ref> used the presence or absence of specific nodes to determine the validity or lack of validity of a given result. Other organizational principles also exist in Doyle's and de Kleer's [16] systems, but the basic framework and system architecture are the same.

Reference-contexts: Tcs thereby assures the module function that the input variables will only have a single value. The intersection of data intervals is quite common in other systems as well, either implicitly in the definition of rule application (see <ref> [24] </ref>) or as an explicit calculation in rules (for example [32]). This approach can also be used for the case of mixed interval and point value inputs. Because the point variables do not have specific time extents associated with them, they do not influence the scheduling. <p> Since the type of inference is limited in a tms, efficient algorithms for performing the updating can be implemented. Although the standard tms does not have special provisions for time-related reasoning, Dressler and Freitag <ref> [24] </ref> have produced a variant on an assumption-based tms which propagates temporal labels as well as the traditional assumption sets. This provides a second indexing method for database query answering.

Reference-contexts: By restricting information storage to statically allocated data areas, G2 can also avoid the need to garbage-collect. Given these constraints, it is not possible to have a general dependency-directed updating system, since the retraction of information can take arbitrarily long. Researchers at Yale <ref> [26, 27] </ref> have explored the use of a parallel architecture called a process trellis for processing real-time monitor data. The process trellis uses a hierarchy of processors, each of which handles a small part of the interpretation. The connections between processors form a directed, acyclic graph. <p> Since each module is complete and (except for its inputs) separate from all other elements of the system, one could create a distributed processing environment using 126 CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSION the tcs process structure. Outwardly, the dependency network of a tcs system resembles the process trellis architecture <ref> [26] </ref> developed at Yale. Tcs provides a more general architecture because there is no need for synchronization between individual modules, and because loops are allowed in the data dependency structure.

Reference-contexts: If arbitrary calculations are permitted, this guarantee cannot be enforced. Real-time expert systems such as G2 <ref> [29, 60] </ref> can guarantee response time by limiting the language to rules which can be easily interpreted. By restricting information storage to statically allocated data areas, G2 can also avoid the need to garbage-collect.

Reference-contexts: As the tcs experiments show, 8.1. TEMPORAL REASONING 107 there is great power in attaching a special interpretation to time. Unfortunately, this can be difficult to do in the general case. The major practical difficulty is that useful temporal logics are undecidable <ref> [31] </ref>. It is also often difficult to formalize certain types of common-sense reasoning that people find quite easy to do. The circumscription approach [51, 58, 86] minimizes logical predicates according to syntactic criteria. Similar minimization techniques can be applied to nonmonotonic logics [79].

Reference-contexts: The back-and-forth nature of the decision-making becomes more pronounced if more sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques are applied. The model parameters, which are derived from population standard estimates, can be refined or adapted to an indivdual patient by comparing the estimates to measured samples. <ref> [36, 37, 39] </ref> It is important to update even the past drug concentration estimates because of the potential effects on the current and future decision-making process.

Reference-contexts: The use of contextual information changes the rate "constants" of the model into variables whose values depend on the state of the patient. Certain aspects of the state can change over time. For example, a digitalis (another cardiac drug) model <ref> [37] </ref> uses a measured parameter, creatinine clearance, to calculate the value of one model parameter. Since the measured patient parameter can change over time, so can the model parameters. Complicating matters is the problem that not all of the contextual information will be available initially. <p> The back-and-forth nature of the decision-making becomes more pronounced if more sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques are applied.

In a situation where the output of the model is used in the process of designing the dosage regimen, as it was in the Arrhythmia Advisor [73] or in the extensions to the Oncocin project <ref> [39] </ref>, this dichotomy around the current time (or next feasible decision point) is essential to the correct functioning of the system. We can continue the expansion of this example by making the model parameters depend on the patient's state. <p> The back-and-forth nature of the decision-making becomes more pronounced if more sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques are applied. The model parameters, which are derived from population standard estimates, can be refined or adapted to an indivdual patient by comparing the estimates to measured samples. <ref> [36, 37, 39] </ref> It is important to update even the past drug concentration estimates because of the potential effects on the current and future decision-making process. <p> This will allow proper utilization of all available data.

Reference-contexts: Since the system knows the meaning of the inference rule or the logical combination rules, it can detect an inconsistent state. This triggers a backtracking procedure focused on the data which contributed to the contradiction. A tms provides one level of Boolean inference (see <ref> [56] </ref> for a more detailed discussion). A key feature of this strategy is the requirement that the system understand the inference procedure. This means that programming inside the tms is limited to use of the system-provided inference mechanisms. Other types of reasoning must take place outside the system.

Reference-contexts: It is also often difficult to formalize certain types of common-sense reasoning that people find quite easy to do. The circumscription approach [51, 58, 86] minimizes logical predicates according to syntactic criteria. Similar minimization techniques can be applied to nonmonotonic logics <ref> [79] </ref>. Hanks and McDermott [33] describe some of the difficulties of dealing with the frame problem using current nonmonotonic logics. The example which is used extensively in the literature is that of loading a gun, waiting and then shooting someone with the gun.

Reference-contexts: Pharmacokinetic Modeling System. This example can model the changing phar-macokinetics of drugs and adjust model parameters in response to changes in relevant clinical data. An argument for the importance of using models in treatment programs can be found in the Oncocin project <ref> [80] </ref> and in topaz [39]. The tcs provides a control environment in which the model can be executed. This demonstrates some of the control ideas and reasoning issues related to discrep ancies between system recommendations and actual user actions. 4. Disease Assessment Program.

Reference-contexts: For a complete description of the syntax and a discussion of the options the reader should consult the reference manual [70]. 2.1 Time and Data Model A distinction can be made between several types of time-related databases. This distinction, following terminology developed by Snodgrass <ref> [82] </ref> is made on the basis of the types of questions that can be answered. A conventional database storing only a set of facts without special support for time is called a snapshot database, because is holds only the currently believed value for each entry. <p> It is important to remember that only conclusions can be revised, whereas past actions cannot be undone. Different database designs and the types of queries that they can answer are discussed by Snodgrass in <ref> [82] </ref>. The ability to maintain a history makes the system capable of providing explanations that involve changes in the belief structure about the world, by maintaining two separate temporal markers with each piece of reasoning: The world time to which 9.3.

Reference-contexts: The action that a programmer wishes a reasoning system to take is usually fairly straightforward. 8.2 Truth Maintenance The idea of a Truth Maintenance System (tms) can trace its roots to the dependency-directed backtracking and constraint-propagation work of Stallman and Sussman <ref> [83] </ref>. This work was extended by Doyle [23] and McAllester [57]. The central idea was that a more efficient recovery from errors or false assumptions could be made by keeping a record of the dependencies among conclusions. This introduced intelligence into what had been a blind backtracking approach.

Reference-contexts: The output from a system using standard lidocaine parameters from Thomson <ref> [84] </ref> is shown in figure 3.5. The control variable used to limit the execution of the pharmacokinetic model can either be supplied as an input from outside the tcs, or it could be computed. <p> We can continue the expansion of this example by making the model parameters depend on the patient's state. For some drugs, estimates of the a priori effects of different medical conditions on the parameter values have been published <ref> [84] </ref>. In this study relevant parameters included the presence of congestive heart failure and liver disease. The use of contextual information changes the rate "constants" of the model into variables whose values depend on the state of the patient. Certain aspects of the state can change over time.

Reference-contexts: This example is shown in the reference manual. [70, p. 30f.] For efficiency reasons it is often desirable to put a temporal limit on the influence of any particular piece of data. Vere <ref> [85] </ref> demonstrates the practical utility of this concept in planning by using a temporal window to limit the time period that is examined by his reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this can be difficult to do in the general case. The major practical difficulty is that useful temporal logics are undecidable [31]. It is also often difficult to formalize certain types of common-sense reasoning that people find quite easy to do. The circumscription approach <ref> [51, 58, 86] </ref> minimizes logical predicates according to syntactic criteria. Similar minimization techniques can be applied to nonmonotonic logics [79]. Hanks and McDermott [33] describe some of the difficulties of dealing with the frame problem using current nonmonotonic logics.

Reference-contexts: The attempt to find a syntactic solution to a semantic problem is flawed. There is some recognition of this problem, since recent work in circumscription and nonmonotonic logic is 108 CHAPTER 8. RELATED WORK exploring ways of adding policies [52] or preferences <ref> [87] </ref> as a way of controlling the reasoning. These represent attempts to introduce semantic content to the default reasoning decisions. 3. Undecidability. In order to capture interesting temporal behavior, the logics used must be so complex as to become undecidable.
