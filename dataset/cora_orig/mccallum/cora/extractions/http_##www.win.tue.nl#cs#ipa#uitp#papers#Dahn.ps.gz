Reference-contexts: The equational prover Discount [De95], developed at the University of Kaiserslautern, was the first German prover used this way. Soon thereafter, it was followed by the provers Setheo [GL94] (Technical University Munich) and KoMeT [BB94](Technical University Darmstadt). Later, the provers Protein <ref> [BF94] </ref> (University Koblenz), Spass [WG96] (Max-Planck-Institute Saarbrucken) and CM (Humboldt University Berlin) have been added. The integration of the equational prover Waldmeister (University Kaiserslautern) and the tableau prover 3TaP (University Karlsruhe) has been recently completed.

Reference-contexts: Proofs can be loaded from the same menu for display with the Tree-Viewer or in natural language with L A T E X or HTML.

This sequence of transformations depends on the prover which has found the proof. It can be changed by the user.

This sequence of transformations depends on the prover which has found the proof. It can be changed by the user. Proof presentation technology was described in [DW96]. It is currently available for untyped proof problems for all integrated provers except Otter. Since anything can be proved correctly from an inconsistent theory, proof presentation has turned out to be a valuable tool to discover errors in formal specifications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the major aims of the German research program "Deduktion" (1992 - 1998) was to combine the power of several automated theorem provers. The ILF system <ref> [DG97] </ref> attempts to realize this. Moreover it intends to make current reasoning technology available to the non-specialist.

Reference-contexts: It was only natural to use the experience gained with the integration of Otter [MC90], to integrate other provers developed within the "Deduk-tion" program in very much the same way. The equational prover Discount <ref> [De95] </ref>, developed at the University of Kaiserslautern, was the first German prover used this way. Soon thereafter, it was followed by the provers Setheo [GL94] (Technical University Munich) and KoMeT [BB94](Technical University Darmstadt).

Reference-contexts: Thus prover-internal changes concerning these parts will not affect the integration of the prover into the ILF system. Recently, ILF has been extended by the DBFW tool <ref> [JW97] </ref> developed at the Technical University Munich. This tool extracts automatically statistical informations of runs of provers within ILF. These informations are regularly mailed to the developers of the prover for support purposes, provided that the ILF user has enabled this procedure.

Reference-contexts: This made it possible, to run several copies of Otter simultaneously in the background while the user could continue his work with an interactive theorem prover in the foreground. It was only natural to use the experience gained with the integration of Otter <ref> [MC90] </ref>, to integrate other provers developed within the "Deduk-tion" program in very much the same way. The equational prover Discount [De95], developed at the University of Kaiserslautern, was the first German prover used this way.
