Abstract: According to a remarkable re-interpretation of a theorem of E.M. Andreev (1970) by W.P. Thurston (1982), there is a unique (up to inversive transformations) packing of interior-disjoint circles in the plane, whose contact graph is any given polyhedral graph G, and such that an analagous "dual" circle packing simultaneously exists, whose contact graph is the planar dual graph G fl , and such that the primal and dual circle packin1qDgs have the same set of tangency points and the primal circles are orthogonal to the dual ones at these tangency points. Our result is obtained by generalizing and reformulating ideas found in the doctoral thesis of Walter Bragger [Math. Institut, Rheinsprung 21, CH-4051 Basel, Feb. 1991] to reduce our problem to maximizing a smooth convex function. This maximization problem is then solved by using Khachian's "ellipsoid method" or Vaidya's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Doyle pointed out Bragger's work to me and helped explain it. The present paper is really only a slight expansion of Bragger's ideas, which in turn (to some extent) depend on ideas found in a paper of Y. Colin de Verdiere's <ref> [4] </ref>. Specifically, the two new ideas found here are 1. the quadrangulation approach, which permits extending Bragger's results to non-simplicial polyhedra, and 2. the idea of applying the ellipsoid algorithm, which is rather old.

Reference-contexts: Most of the competing methods would be better in this respect. In view of these practical advantages, which cannot be matched by the algorithm of the present paper (although our algorithm can achieve ultimate quadratic convergence by switching from the ellipsoid algorithm to a conjugate gradient method <ref> [6] </ref>, say, at an apposite moment), we doubt our result will have much direct practical impact. 6 Acknowledgements Peter G.

Any planar graph is a subgraph of a polyhedral graph, if it isn't polyhedral itself, so theorem 1 of course shows the existence of circle packings whose contact graph is any planar graph.

Reference-contexts: How does this algorithm for conformal mapping compare with the competition the usual numerical methods?

Our method has the theoretical advantage that it comes with a proof of polynomial running time and a proof of accuracy, and also it has the psychological advantage that there are all these highly visible and reassuring circles lying about.

Reference-contexts: The integral, however, is somewhat more daunting. Integrals like Z log cot x dx (5) may be expressed as differences of Clausen integrals Cl 2 (u) = 0 x j dx (6) with appropriate linearly transformed arguments. These Clausen integrals are discussed at length in <ref> [12] </ref> although not from a particularly algorithmic point of view. For example the Fourier series Cl 2 (u) = n1 n 2 ; (7) given there, while convergent everywhere, is not of great utility.
