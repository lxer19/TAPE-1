Title: Position Paper: Designing Graphic Presentations Based on a Theory of Understanding  
Author: Michael Schiff 
Date: September 1, 1993  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California, Berkeley  
Abstract: Most existing intelligent visualization systems seem to be based choosing and combining members of a fixed set of graphic techniques. Although these systems can be fairly powerful, they are limited by the graphic techniques they have at their disposal. This paper outlines a new, more versatile approach to the problem: basing an intelligent visualization system on an explicit theory of graphic presentation understanding, without using a fixed set of graphic techniques. In essence, this allows the construction of new types of graphic presentations from first principles.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Previous attempts at constructing intelligent graphic presentation systems have often been based on choosing and combining members of a fixed set of graphical techniques or languages that can represent part of the data to be visualized. Mackinlay's APT [10, 11], Casner's BOZ <ref> [2] </ref>, and Roth et al's SAGE [14, 15, 16] all fall into this category. A fair amount of other research, aimed more directly at automating scientific visualization, also seems to be based on this general paradigm [7, 13, 17]. <p> knowledge about perception, conservative assumptions (e.g. about lack of interaction) should make this language-independent approach as least as accurate as others, and as further knowledge becomes available it should be easy to improve the system's performance. 5 Many authors have explicitly discussed various perceptual issues in context of graphic processing <ref> [2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon might be useful in designing graphic presentations. Storing knowledge about perceptual capabilities independently from graphic languages also has the potential to make a system more versatile, by describing the visual properties of complex graphic objects without reference to specific graphic techniques. For example, as discussed in <ref> [3] </ref> Weber's law predicts why it is easier to compare the lengths of two bars with scaling frames than the lengths of two bars without frames (see figure 2), but there is no way to use this knowledge in a language-based system without a specific framed-rectangle language. <p> knowledge about perception, conservative assumptions (e.g. about lack of interaction) should make this language-independent approach as least as accurate as others, and as further knowledge becomes available it should be easy to improve the system's performance. 5 Many authors have explicitly discussed various perceptual issues in context of graphic processing <ref> [2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These translate into assumptions that people make about graphs. These principles include consistency in the use of visual dimensions, non-redundancy, etc. Research with sixth graders has shown that even though they are unfamiliar with specific forms of representation such as line graphs, they have substantial meta-representational expertise <ref> [4] </ref>. That is, they have many reasonable ideas about what a graphic representation should be. Some researchers, developing cognitive models of graphical understanding, have relied on knowledge schemas for interpretation of various individual graphic forms [9, 12].

Reference-contexts: Along with the constraints formed by encodings, effectiveness metrics associated with perceptual rules for perceiving covaria-tion patterns, etc., these constraints might lead to a presentation looking like figure 3, similar to the gray-scale diagrams discussed in <ref> [5] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Intelligent visualization systems that rely on a fixed set of graphic languages can be useful, but are ultimately limited by the languages they incorporate. Furthermore, making decisions at the level of graphic languages tends to ignore certain types of interactions between those languages.

Reference-contexts: Of course, this interpretive process depends on experience as well as on perceptual capabilities. * There seem to be cases where different visual dimensions interact to form new dimensions which can be processed more quickly than either of the component dimensions. Garner <ref> [6] </ref> argues that the height and width of rectangles, for example, interact to produce a dimension of form. Experimental subjects can distinguish rectangles differing in both height and width 4 more quickly than rectangles varying in only height or width. This phenomenon might be useful in designing graphic presentations.

The most reasonable solution to this problem seems to be the use of a common unit of measurement for all the effectiveness metrics: time. This is attempted in Lohse's UCIE system <ref> [9] </ref> for determing the quality of graphic presentations. Although the problem is more difficult here, because interpretation as well as perception is described in general terms, it should be possible to at least roughly estimate global effectiveness.

Reference-contexts: As Pinker points out, particular values of configural properties (e.g. particular shapes of curves) may even be recognized as carrying distinct meanings <ref> [12] </ref>.
