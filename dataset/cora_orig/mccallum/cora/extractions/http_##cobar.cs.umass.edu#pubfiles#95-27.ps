Abstract: Recent explosion in networked information resources has been attracting much attention to the problem of automated methods for gathering information in response to a query from a user. However, most of this literature deals with locating, gathering and selecting the best response to a query from among a multitude of responses from different sources. In this paper, we deal with a different model of response to a query. No single source of information may contain the complete response to a query and hence may necessitate piecing together mutually related partial responses from disparate and possibly heterogeneous sources. We present a system for cooperative retrieval and composition of a case in which sub-cases are distributed across different agents in a multi-agent system. From a Gestalt perspective, a good overall case may not be the one derived from the summation of best subcases. Each agent's partial view may result in local cases that are best matches based on the local view. However, these local cases when assembled may not result in the best overall case in terms of global measures. We propose a negotiation-driven case retrieval algorithm as an approach to dynamically resolving inconsistencies between different case pieces during the retrieval process.

Reference-contexts: We draw upon our experience with these methods to extend them to case-based systems in a distributed environment. The issue of distributed casebases, to our knowledge, has not been studied in the multi-agent context. Barletta et al <ref> [2] </ref> and Redmond et al [23] deal with distributed cases in single agent systems. In these approaches, each case is divided into subcases or snippets and a snippet is indexed using both global goals and the local context of that snippet within the case. <p> This sort of representation is different from the the distributed casebase scenario we discussed in the paper. In a multi-agent system, there may be no monolithic case until the subcases are retrieved and assembled. Barletta and Mark <ref> [2] </ref> break cases into pieces where each piece is a sequence of actions used to recover from a hypothesized fault. JULIANA [25] and CELIA [23] implement a distributed case representation tha t is closer in spirit to the work described here.

Reference-contexts: Another scenario one could envisage is the existence of casebases spread across a communication network, like PARTNET on World Wide Web. A multi-agent system comprises a group of intelligent agents working towards a set of common global goals or separate individual goals that interact <ref> [3] </ref>. In such a system, each of the agents may not be individually capable of achieving the global goal and/or their goals have interactions and hence a need for coordination among the set of agents arises.

Reference-contexts: An agent has to obtain its components from manufacturer-specified catalogue casebases that may be distributed across the Internet. For example, it may treat WWW-accessible distributed component database system like PARTNET <ref> [5, 22] </ref> as its case-base from which to draw its component. In addition to the constraints arising from the overall design requirements, constraints on a component could also arise from the specifications of other components in the design.

Reference-contexts: This paper is concerned with this kind of cooperative retrieval of compatible distributed cases. In 1 our work on Negotiated Search [17] 1 and DRESUN <ref> [6] </ref>, we proposed certain general mechanisms for performing distributed search in multi-agent systems.

This paper deals with explicit detection of inconsistencies among the local solutions and subsequent focussed resolution of these inconsistencies <ref> [7] </ref>. In negotiated retrieval, feedback on the causes of conflicts detected leads to an improved retrieval in subsequent rounds where these conflicts are avoided. An agent which assimilates feedback from other agents enhances its view of global problem solving requirements leading to an improved retrieval process.

Reference-contexts: In addition, assimilation may be specialized based on context i.e. the feedback assimilated is applicable only in specific contexts at the local agent. For example, a particular constraint may be applicable only if certain features are within certain ranges of values <ref> [8] </ref>. In addition, assimilation process may also involve transformations where an agent uses the feedback from other agents to generate its own local constraints rather than directly incorporating the feedback. <p> Termination criteria depend on problem solving requirements. Various termination criteria ranging from simple heuristics to complicated decision theoretic methods have been proposed for multi-agent systems <ref> [8] </ref>. One simple criteria used in our DCBR systems to be discussed later is as follows: Any agent that detects a case that has subcase contributions by all the relevant agents and has been validated against their local constraints issues a termination message to all the agents.

Reference-contexts: Selectively sharing relevant partial results of a local search or data can enhance the global problem solving quality and efficiency without paying a large price for communication. In some recent studies, Decker and Lesser <ref> [12] </ref> further quantify these observations and discuss various trade-offs involved in communication vs enhanced problem solving efficiency.

There has been some work in breaking a single case into pieces and reasoning with these pieces in a single agent context. MEDIATOR <ref> [15] </ref> represents large cases monolithically with pieces embedded as parts which can be located within a larger case. A case is indexed both by its own indices and those of its pieces. This sort of representation is different from the the distributed casebase scenario we discussed in the paper.

Reference-contexts: However, this may not be the only way. In the case of a set of reusable agents <ref> [16] </ref>, each agent could have acquired its own independent problem-solving experiences by participating in different teams of agents. Or a Case-Knowledge Engineer could design each of the case bases by giving them episodes from his collection of cases. <p> The receiving agents assimilate this feedback, leading to an enhanced view of the global requirements for future operations. The subsequent initiation or extend or merge is more likely to avoid the same conflicts. Thus, our problem is cast as a distributed constraint optimization problem <ref> [16] </ref> implying that not all constraints need to be satisfied in a solution. As many constraints are satisfied as is possible. Constraints have differing amounts of flexibility. Some may be hard, meaning that they must be satisfied in any legal solution. <p> A partial case s, denoted by s , is composed of one or more locally retrieved cases (from different agents): s = i 1 i 2 : : : t z where 1 z jj 3 For example in TEAM <ref> [16] </ref>, from which our DCBR system draws its inspiration, an agent's sub-design possesses shared features with another agent's sub-design. Pump and Motor share a parameter required-power. Both agents have to arrive at the same value for the required-power parameter. <p> An agent recognizes particular features of the solution space and decides to use a more efficient customized search strategy. It can advise the other agent to play a particular role in this customized search. Lander <ref> [16] </ref> presents a good example of a customized search called linear compromise where agents, upon recognizing the linear nature of their solution space, decide to exchange end points and extrapolate between them to find the intersection point as a mutual compromise solution. <p> DENEGOT system [19] presents a distributed negotiation algorithm for distributed planning and TEAM presents a negotiated search algorithm for distributed search among a set of heterogeneous agents <ref> [16] </ref>. Negotiated retrieval is specifically tailored to distributed casebases with strategies for broadening and deepening a search in a casebase not necessarily applicable to planning domains dealt with in DENEGOT. In addition, negotiating over conflicts in subcases can be qualitatively different from negotiations over plans in DENEGOT. <p> Thus we resort to weak declarative constraint based knowledge to reason about possible interactions between subcases. The strategies in negotiated retrieval include the strategies in negotiated search as a subset. In this sense, negotiated retrieval is more general than negotiated search. In addition, negotiated search as discussed in Lander <ref> [16] </ref> imposes a sequentiality in search by giving an agent only two options either extend an existing solution or initiate a new solution which other agents sequentially extend. The following section presents a multi-agent system that incorporates a restricted form of negotiated retrieval (i.e. negotiated search as discussed in Lander [16]) <p> <ref> [16] </ref> imposes a sequentiality in search by giving an agent only two options either extend an existing solution or initiate a new solution which other agents sequentially extend. The following section presents a multi-agent system that incorporates a restricted form of negotiated retrieval (i.e. negotiated search as discussed in Lander [16]) and then shows a brief trace from the system. <p> In the section on experiments, we discuss an abstract DCBR system and show some early empirical results on the negotiated retrieval mechanism. 3 CBR-TEAM: A Multi-Agent Design System We now present a multi-agent system called CBR-TEAM whose core is derived from TEAM <ref> [16] </ref>. TEAM is a parametric design system that uses a cooperative heterogeneous set of reusable agents, each of which has the capability to produce a component of the overall design which is stored in a centralized blackboard. <p> The TEAM system has six domain agents for the design of six components in a steam condenser and a critic agent that checks for certain features in the assembled design. It is a multi-strategy inferencing system <ref> [16] </ref> in which different strategies are seamlessly integrated into a design framework. The interactions between the components generate constraints for these strategies leading agents to iteratively negotiate on their results to find an acceptable design. <p> Agents whose components do not match are said to be in conflict. The conflicting set of agents negotiate a resolution which involves a search guided by numerical-valued constraints on the mutually known parameters, or other strategies like linear compromise <ref> [16] </ref>. CBR-TEAM is a modification of the TEAM system and comprises a subset of the agents that retrieve and use suitable members from catalogues of manufacturer-specified models for designing their components.

Reference-contexts: Due to its partial view of the problem-solving situation, an agent may have access only to a part of the environment, and communication bandwidth limitations and heterogeneity of representations may limit its view of other agents' state. Given these uncertainties <ref> [18] </ref>, an agent may have to do evidential reasoning and focused negotiation to resolve them to the extent that it can make positive contributions to the on-going problem solving process. <p> This sort of broadening of allowed strategies upon failure is similar to the broadening of retrieval in our algorithm. The negotiated retrieval algorithm benefits from a long history of thought in DAI and Multi-agent systems. Lesser <ref> [18] </ref> discusses the importance of interactions among subgoals and data distributed across a set of agents in distributed problem solving. Selectively sharing relevant partial results of a local search or data can enhance the global problem solving quality and efficiency without paying a large price for communication.

Relaxing a soft constraint may only involve penalties in terms of loss of optimality in the desirable attributes. For example, relaxing a soft constraint in a multi-agent design system like CBR-TEAM (to be discussed below) leads to less reliable components. <p> DENEGOT system <ref> [19] </ref> presents a distributed negotiation algorithm for distributed planning and TEAM presents a negotiated search algorithm for distributed search among a set of heterogeneous agents [16].

Reference-contexts: However, in multi-agent systems the agent casebases may be developed in disparate situations making it impractical to follow this strategy. So negotiated retrieval tries to deal with incompatibilities between pieces by detecting and resolving them at the retrieval time. Rissland et al <ref> [24] </ref> discuss a CBR system called FRANK for report generation. Based on user's communicable constraint, then the corresponding agent can only reject a composite solution without being able to give any feedback, just as in the simple retrieval algorithm above.
