Abstract: This paper presents the current state of the logic that I am using to analyse entailment, implicature and presupposition in natural language. The logic is very fine-grained and is able to make distinctions that are outside the scope of classical logic. It is independently motivated by certain properties of natural human reasoning, namely partiality, paraconsis-tency, relevance, and defeasibility: once these are accounted for, the data on implicature and presupposition comes quite naturally.

Reference-contexts: Priest and Routley [PR89a, PR89b] give an overview of the issues raised by paraconsistency. 1.2.3 Relevance For a logic to be relevant there must be some connection between the antecedent and consequent to count as a legitimate instance of the entailment relation. 1 Anderson and Belnap <ref> [AB75] </ref> present a detailed analysis of the property of relevance that relies on both proof-theoretic and semantic definitions of relevant connection to filter irrelevant entailments.

Reference-contexts: Whilst it performed important ground work, there has been much criticism of the Anderson and Belnap approach to relevance, not least of which is that a natural semantics for the logics were not, initially, forthcoming: Avron notes that "the systems' construction was not guided by clear semantical ideas and notions" <ref> [Avr92, p.244] </ref>. More recently Read [Rea88] and Avron [Avr92] have investigated systems of relevance reasoning that, instead of generating the standard entailments and filtering out the irrelevant ones, attempt to restrict the entailment relation in principled ways to prevent the generation of irrelevances in the first place. <p> More recently Read [Rea88] and Avron <ref> [Avr92] </ref> have investigated systems of relevance reasoning that, instead of generating the standard entailments and filtering out the irrelevant ones, attempt to restrict the entailment relation in principled ways to prevent the generation of irrelevances in the first place. <p> But the connectives given here are clearly unambiguous and yet they capture this data. This is achieved, in part, by relaxing extensionality; however, as Avron has shown, the principles of relevance are not compatible with purely extensional connectives <ref> [Avr92] </ref>, so if we wish to include relevance as a principle of natural reasoning we must anyway, to some extent, give up extensionality. 4.2.1 Conjunction We are now in a position to model the data from the given compound sentences beginning with the conjunctive cases.

Reference-contexts: Many writers have used the paraconsistent logic F OU R: Belnap [Bel77] uses it to develop a computational model of an epistemic agent, Muskens [Mus88] employs it to handle propositional attitudes in Montague Grammar, Fitting [Fit89b] uses it to develop a semantics for negation in logic programming, and Escriba <ref> [BE92] </ref> applies a four-valued logic to analysing situation semantics.

Reference-contexts: An epistemic state is a set of first order setups. Multiple setups in a single epistemic state carry disjunctive information relative to each other, whilst within a setup, information is construed conjunctively. This is derived directly from the work of Belnap <ref> [Bel75, Bel77] </ref> who presents a propositional definition for setups in FOU R. 2.3.1 Evidential Links I begin by introducing evidential links. These form a part of the model structure and are used as the primitive for defining the semantics of the ebl implication operator.

Reference-contexts: Clearly most deductions are going to be unaffected by any particular inconsistency and this is what paraconsistency captures. Many writers have used the paraconsistent logic F OU R: Belnap <ref> [Bel77] </ref> uses it to develop a computational model of an epistemic agent, Muskens [Mus88] employs it to handle propositional attitudes in Montague Grammar, Fitting [Fit89b] uses it to develop a semantics for negation in logic programming, and Escriba [BE92] applies a four-valued logic to analysing situation semantics. <p> The system also adds a number of useful programming tools and, instead of using a tableau-based theorem prover, uses a rewrite-based approach. Within the Qlog2 environment, a system based on the work of Belnap <ref> [Bel77] </ref> has been imple 5 mented that uses a model-based inference engine to represent the epistemic states of an agent, and to capture how those states change with new input and inferences based on those inputs. <p> If S = f0; 1g then the resulting space corresponds to Belnap's logic F OU R <ref> [Bel77] </ref> (see Figure 2). If S = f0; 1 2 ; 1g then the resulting space gives the logic PRESU P that underlies my current model of defeasible inference (see Figure 3). <p> An epistemic state is a set of first order setups. Multiple setups in a single epistemic state carry disjunctive information relative to each other, whilst within a setup, information is construed conjunctively. This is derived directly from the work of Belnap <ref> [Bel75, Bel77] </ref> who presents a propositional definition for setups in FOU R. 2.3.1 Evidential Links I begin by introducing evidential links. These form a part of the model structure and are used as the primitive for defining the semantics of the ebl implication operator. <p> It provides a basic semantics for declarative sentences under which a 12 sentence is seen as a function from epistemic states to epistemic states (see Belnap <ref> [Bel77] </ref>). Let 2 ebl, and E be an epistemic state: then, in general, the result of updating E with will be denoted by + i (E). <p> This is a lexical property of the predicate that has to be specified on an individual basis. 3.2.3 The Recursive Propositional Clauses With the addition of the clauses for the `presumably' operator and Fitting's guard connective the following clauses are all derived from Belnap's work <ref> [Bel77] </ref>: Definition 16 (Propositional Assertion) For ; 2 ebl: i (E) = (b) (:) i (E) i (E) = + 2 i (E) i (E) is undefined 3.

Reference-contexts: Partiality is not a controversial feature of a logic: Kleene formalized it in 1952 [Kle52] and it is widely accepted in many contemporary semantic formalisms (e.g. Situation Semantics [Bar89]). I shall have nothing further to say on this matter here | Blamey <ref> [Bla86] </ref> gives a good overview of the topic. 1.2.2 Paraconsistency In terms of consequence relations, paraconsistency stands in contrast to explosiveness: Priest and Routley [PR89b, p.151] describe an entailment relation j= as explosive iff for all wffs A and B, fA; :Ag j= B. <p> Thijsse [Thi90] discusses a variety of entailment relations in the Belnap four-valued logic, and Veltman [Vel91] investigates entailments in a dynamic logic. The treatment given here draws on both these sources. Blamey <ref> [Bla86] </ref> notes that the standard classical definition breaks into two once a logic is partial.

Reference-contexts: Because of this I believe that the conservative position taken by many semanticists with respect to classical logic (e.g. Kempson [Kem75] and Burton-Roberts <ref> [BR89] </ref>) is misplaced and arises because of focusing on too narrow a range of data. Once one considers human reasoning in general it becomes clear that there are many properties that are outside the scope of classical logic but which can, and should, be captured within a semantic theory.

Reference-contexts: [[ * ]] s = ([[ ]] E 0 ) : [[ ]] E 0 :([[ ]] E 0 ) : F where E 0 = CLOS ( + 1 (fsg)) The clause for the semantics of the implication connective is a variation on that given by Cross and Thomason <ref> [CT92] </ref>, which in turn is based on the "Ramsay rule" for conditionals.

Reference-contexts: To put it another way, as de Kleer says, classical logic "insists that the presence of inconsistency renders all deduction meaningless" <ref> [dK86, p.131] </ref>. Clearly most deductions are going to be unaffected by any particular inconsistency and this is what paraconsistency captures. <p> Thus defaults and exceptions can break the property of monotonicity, for a reasoning system. Other approaches to defeasibility include: Konolige's Hierarchical Autoepistemic Logic or hael [Kon88], which relies on prioritizing inference rules into different levels and ordering the inference process accordingly; de Kleer's Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance System or atms <ref> [dK86] </ref>, which keeps track of the specific assumptions used to derive particular conclusions; and Veltman's Update Semantics [Vel91], which uses a notion of ordering worlds to model expectation patterns. In addition, some writers have attempted to determine the basic principles that underlie all of these disparate systems.

Reference-contexts: are prioritized according to their strictness. 3.3.1 Inference as Information Flow In this section I wish to consider a set of inference patterns where the relations are stipulated: these include the analytical truths of language such as the relation between "bachelor" and "married" which Montague used meaning postulates to capture <ref> [DWP81, p.224] </ref>. For example, if it is known that there is a relation between two arbitrary expressions and such that ) and it is further known that holds, then the inference that holds is sound.

Reference-contexts: A similarity to Fauconnier's work <ref> [Fau85] </ref> should be clear here: a disjunction introduces epistemic alternatives for an agent and these are represented as separate "spaces" within the overall epistemic state. I shall pursue this characterization when extending the logic to include the modal operators of necessity and possibility.

Fitting [Fit91] extends the logic programming theory to arbitrary bilattices. <p> These provide ways of combining evidence relating to a sentence from multiple sources, and are useful in the logic programming application of bilattices, as well as the specification of the semantic clauses of ebl. Fitting <ref> [Fit89b] </ref> has introduced a connective which he calls guard . The definition for this is: Definition 4 (Guard) ha; bi : hc; di = hb c; b di This connective is particularly useful when using bilattices as the basis for logic programming.

Reference-contexts: The Qlog2 language is based on the work of Fitting [Fit89b] who developed a tableau-based programming language called Q-Log that uses the bilattice logic F OU R to provide a paraconsistent programming system with a well-behaved monotonic negation. Fitting <ref> [Fit91] </ref> extends the logic programming theory to arbitrary bilattices. The Qlog2 system extends the implementation work of Fitting by allowing the specification of arbitrary evidential bilattices as the semantic space of the program; this allows for defeasible, as well as paraconsistent, logic programming.

Reference-contexts: The space of evaluation used by ebl is defined by an evidential bilattice. This is a well defined subset of the general space of distributive bilattices where a bilattice is distributive if each of the meet and join operators on the two ordering distributes over all of the operators <ref> [Fit92, Gin88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The order of application is defined by the strength of the links with the strongest links being applied first and the weakest links last. Gazdar's pragmatic theory of presupposition <ref> [Gaz79] </ref> also imposes an order on the application of inferences; however, he himself acknowledges this to be arbitrary and supported by no other reason than that it works.

Reference-contexts: At this level we gain the second property of paraconsistency and, through careful definition of the inference relation, the third property of relevance. At the final level we have two possible bilattices that introduce defeasibility: on the left is the bilattice suggested by Ginsberg <ref> [Gin88, p.270] </ref>, whilst on the right is the bilattice PRE SU P which I adopt. Whilst Ginsberg's bilattice is simpler, it lacks certain properties and is outside of the family of evidential bilattices. <p> I then define the syntax for ebl and finally present the data structure that the system uses to record its knowledge, i.e. the basis of the model-theoretic semantics for the language. 2.1 The Structure of the Evidential Space A bilattice <ref> [Gin88] </ref> is simply a lattice with two orderings defined over its structure, with each ordering generating its own meet and join operators. <p> The space of evaluation used by ebl is defined by an evidential bilattice. This is a well defined subset of the general space of distributive bilattices where a bilattice is distributive if each of the meet and join operators on the two ordering distributes over all of the operators <ref> [Fit92, Gin88] </ref>. I shall say that a bilattice is evidential if it can be defined as the pairwise product of a certain type of algebra with itself. <p> Definition 9 (Evidential-Weighting Function) f fl (ha; bi) = &lt; h0; bi if a &lt; b ha; bi otherwise This function corresponds to a non-homomorphic mapping onto the space of constants used in the bilattice DEF AULT as given by Ginsberg <ref> [Gin88, p.270] </ref> (see Figure 4). Although the mapping is onto the constants used in DEF AULT , it is not onto the lattice itself. Further, note that the bilattice DEF AULT is not an evidential bilattice. A further function of importance here is the semi-designation function.

Reference-contexts: In approaching the problem this way I take the same route as Mercer [Mer92a, Mer92b] who applies Reiter's default logic [Rei87] to presupposition, and Beaver [Bea93] who starts from considerations of anaphor and epistemic modality using a system of dynamic logic (see Groenendijk and Stokhof <ref> [GS91] </ref> and Veltman [Vel91]) which he then applies to presupposition.

Reference-contexts: It thus shares similar practical concerns with the work of Gunji <ref> [Gun82] </ref> who uses a formalism that he calls extended intensional LISP to implement a system that can handle implicatures and presuppositions in addition to traditional entailments. The system described here is implemented in a mixture of Prolog and the bilattice logic programming language Qlog2.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the inferences drawn will depend on what has been asserted. However, what has been asserted is taken as given: it is information provided by external agents, and the system is credulous in that it simply accepts everything that it is told. Kempson <ref> [Kem75, p.30] </ref> argues that speech act distinctions such as assertion/question/imperative are not part of semantics. In contrast, the distinction between assertion and evaluation in this logic makes a useful semantic base for distinguishing declarative meaning from interrogative meaning. <p> Because of this I believe that the conservative position taken by many semanticists with respect to classical logic (e.g. Kempson <ref> [Kem75] </ref> and Burton-Roberts [BR89]) is misplaced and arises because of focusing on too narrow a range of data. <p> For example, Kempson, on the basis of examples such as these, decided that a logical theory of presupposition would require ambiguous connectives <ref> [Kem75] </ref>. But the connectives given here are clearly unambiguous and yet they capture this data.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, an agent with a partial logic can answer "I don't know" to a question: this corresponds to allowing evaluations of propositions to be undefined in the semantics. Partiality is not a controversial feature of a logic: Kleene formalized it in 1952 <ref> [Kle52] </ref> and it is widely accepted in many contemporary semantic formalisms (e.g. Situation Semantics [Bar89]).

Reference-contexts: Some approaches need to invoke complex functions associated with each logical connective to determine which of its constituents' inferences get passed along (e.g. the Karttunen and Peters <ref> [KP79] </ref> system). However, such mechanisms seem ad hoc and external to the basic specification. If the facts of "projection" could be made to emerge from the basic logical specification of the inference relation without additional machinery then this would be a clear advance.

Reference-contexts: In approaching the problem this way I take the same route as Mercer <ref> [Mer92a, Mer92b] </ref> who applies Reiter's default logic [Rei87] to presupposition, and Beaver [Bea93] who starts from considerations of anaphor and epistemic modality using a system of dynamic logic (see Groenendijk and Stokhof [GS91] and Veltman [Vel91]) which he then applies to presupposition. <p> What is interesting here is that the same basic logical mechanism has been employed to handle three distinct types of data: entailment , implicature and presupposition. The ebl logic has this aim in common with Mercer's application of default logic to entailment and presupposition <ref> [Mer92b] </ref>. To this end, presupposition is treated as a form of inference. Further, this approach gives a novel insight into the debate as to whether presupposition is a unique logical relation in its own right or merely entailment augmented with pragmatics. <p> Entailment, implicature and presupposition are all seen as particular reasoning patterns distinguished by the component inferential links assigned in each case. The ebl system is thus in the same tradition as Mercer's work <ref> [Mer92b] </ref> in trying to provide a uniform formalism for encoding a range of different relations. An important point to note is that the logic can capture these linguistically motivated relations without any extra machinery.

Reference-contexts: Clearly most deductions are going to be unaffected by any particular inconsistency and this is what paraconsistency captures. Many writers have used the paraconsistent logic F OU R: Belnap [Bel77] uses it to develop a computational model of an epistemic agent, Muskens <ref> [Mus88] </ref> employs it to handle propositional attitudes in Montague Grammar, Fitting [Fit89b] uses it to develop a semantics for negation in logic programming, and Escriba [BE92] applies a four-valued logic to analysing situation semantics.

Reference-contexts: Situation Semantics [Bar89]). I shall have nothing further to say on this matter here | Blamey [Bla86] gives a good overview of the topic. 1.2.2 Paraconsistency In terms of consequence relations, paraconsistency stands in contrast to explosiveness: Priest and Routley <ref> [PR89b, p.151] </ref> describe an entailment relation j= as explosive iff for all wffs A and B, fA; :Ag j= B.

Reference-contexts: However, there are paraconsistent logics that are not relevant in any stronger sense, e.g. Priest <ref> [Pri79] </ref>. 3 Whilst it performed important ground work, there has been much criticism of the Anderson and Belnap approach to relevance, not least of which is that a natural semantics for the logics were not, initially, forthcoming: Avron notes that "the systems' construction was not guided by clear semantical ideas and

Reference-contexts: More recently Read <ref> [Rea88] </ref> and Avron [Avr92] have investigated systems of relevance reasoning that, instead of generating the standard entailments and filtering out the irrelevant ones, attempt to restrict the entailment relation in principled ways to prevent the generation of irrelevances in the first place.

Reference-contexts: In approaching the problem this way I take the same route as Mercer [Mer92a, Mer92b] who applies Reiter's default logic <ref> [Rei87] </ref> to presupposition, and Beaver [Bea93] who starts from considerations of anaphor and epistemic modality using a system of dynamic logic (see Groenendijk and Stokhof [GS91] and Veltman [Vel91]) which he then applies to presupposition. <p> Now, any formalization of an agent's knowledge of the world is going to be incomplete, but the agent must still be able to reason sensibly (thus we have a connection between default reasoning and the principle of partiality introduced above). Reiter says <ref> [Rei87, p.71] </ref> that "the role of a default is to fill in some of the gaps in the knowledge base". However, it must ensure that if assumptions are made to fill the gaps, and those assumptions later turn out to be incorrect, then corrections can be easily made.

Reference-contexts: In approaching the problem this way I take the same route as Mercer [Mer92a, Mer92b] who applies Reiter's default logic [Rei87] to presupposition, and Beaver [Bea93] who starts from considerations of anaphor and epistemic modality using a system of dynamic logic (see Groenendijk and Stokhof [GS91] and Veltman <ref> [Vel91] </ref>) which he then applies to presupposition. I have settled on four properties that I believe a theory of natural reasoning should account for 2 if it is to have legitimate claim to the title. <p> to defeasibility include: Konolige's Hierarchical Autoepistemic Logic or hael [Kon88], which relies on prioritizing inference rules into different levels and ordering the inference process accordingly; de Kleer's Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance System or atms [dK86], which keeps track of the specific assumptions used to derive particular conclusions; and Veltman's Update Semantics <ref> [Vel91] </ref>, which uses a notion of ordering worlds to model expectation patterns. In addition, some writers have attempted to determine the basic principles that underlie all of these disparate systems. <p> Thijsse [Thi90] discusses a variety of entailment relations in the Belnap four-valued logic, and Veltman <ref> [Vel91] </ref> investigates entailments in a dynamic logic.

Reference-contexts: In the theorem prover this behaviour is selectable so it is possible to set things so that all inferences are recomputed at each cycle, or conversely that default inferences are all permanently recorded. In this latter case we have a situation that is psychologically quite interesting (see <ref> [WL88] </ref>).
