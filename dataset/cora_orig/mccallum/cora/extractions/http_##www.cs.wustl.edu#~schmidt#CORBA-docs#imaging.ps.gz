Abstract: The proposed category addresses the needs of imagery application vertical markets. There are many important markets that are heavily dependent upon imagery applications, such as Medical, Defense, Publishing, Surveying, Photogammetry, Biology, Mapping, EOSDIS, Document Management and others. In most application domains, imagery is being migrated from hardcopy forms to electronic (softcopy) forms. This migration places new requirements on system performance and interoperability that are poorly addressed by general purpose (non-image-based) solutions. Imagery facilities is a specialty area with unique requirements. Handling of imagery is a primary concern in the design of the system, given the performance and storage consequences of moving, copying, and processing large images. Imagery applications have needs for special purpose component software algorithms, which may vary in implementation based upon the target platform, accelerator hardware, and deployed environment. For these reasons, many legacy image systems are highly customized, non-interoperable, "closed systems". In addition, there are many kinds of data attached to imagery. The diversity of this data is increasing with the increased availability of online information. Interoperability with applications that can browse and process the attached data is a primary concern in imagery applications. Interfaces to these applications need to be simple and cost effective, because new capabilities are often added to imagery applications over their long lifecycle. There is an emerging commercial market for imagery applications that would benefit greatly from standardization. Vendors such as Digital Equipment and Paragon Imaging are supportive of this effort to standardize imagery facilities and would be likely respondents/contributors to RFP or RFC proposals in this area. Vendors realize that the success of the commercial market is dependent upon the right standards being established to allow multi-vendor participation in imagery systems applications, and for the standards reducing the risk of suppliers and consumers to develop highly effective solutions to imagery interoperability issues.

Reference-contexts: Other models address the needs of a specific end-user community ; typically, they are supersets of the generic models with more detail in particular areas. The DISCUS project is using the CORNERSTONE ICIS as the standards profile <ref> [ICIS] </ref>. ICIS is often referred to as the "POSIX Reference Model with imagery extensions" because it utilizes many of the POSIX standards and adds to the reference model in the area of imagery-related 8 standards. Table 1 is a summary of how DISCUS supports the ICIS model.
