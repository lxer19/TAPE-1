Abstract: The human notion of incest is based solely on family tree. We introduce this idea into genetic algorithms to study its effect on performance. We show a simple implementation which can be added to any GA design. We find that, for our six traveling salesperson problems, prohibiting incest increases genetic diversity in the evolving population and im proves the quality of the final solutions.

Reference-contexts: The concept of "incest prohibition" as applied to GA's has been investigated previously and as with human cultures the definition varies. For Eshelman and Schaf fer the incest prohibition was based on the Hamming distance. <ref> (Eshelman and Schaffer, 1991.) </ref> In particular, they prevented solutions from mating if their Hamming distance fell below a certain threshold. While their approach more directly addresses the issue of diversity, it pays the cost of calculating Hamming distances.

Reference-contexts: Incest prohibition based on ancestry is similar to Glover's tabu lists except that each individual carries its own custom private tabu list <ref> (Glover, 1989) </ref>. We can see that family tree size grows as 2 g - 1 where g is the number of generations considered. By varying incest law as an experimental parameter we can study the effects of a range of incest prohibition.

Reference-contexts: One answer lies in the human practice of prohibiting incest. Human cultures practice enormously divergent customs. Yet one custom they all share is the prohibition of incest <ref> (Kottak, 1974.) </ref> They may define it in different ways, but they all define it in some way and prohibit it. It is generally held that the benefits such prohibition brings to society is, among others, greater diversity in the human gene pool.

Reference-contexts: Much of it has focused on maintaining diversity in the evolving population. Along that line Whitley suggests that population diversity is one of perhaps only two primary factors in genetic search (the other being selection pressure.) <ref> (Whitley, 1989) </ref> With this thought in mind we look to the natural world to see how Mother Nature encourages population diversity. One answer lies in the human practice of prohibiting incest. Human cultures practice enormously divergent customs.

Reference-contexts: This fraction represents the portions of the two solutions which do not match. A similar idea has been used in <ref> (Whitley and Stark-weather, 1990.) </ref> The diversity measure is intimately tied to TSP. However, it is not part of the incest prohibition system, itself.
