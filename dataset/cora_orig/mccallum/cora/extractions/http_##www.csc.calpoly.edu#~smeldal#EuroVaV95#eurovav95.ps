Abstract: This paper reports on an ongoing experiment whose main purpose is to investigate to what extent object orientation might solve the existing or potential problems inherent in the verification and validation of KBSs, when these investigations are carried out at a level higher than the implementation level. Techniques for specifying and reasoning about properties of KBSs have been described in previous literature. The main contribution of this paper consists of applying recent work on algebraic theory of objectoriented programming to the specification and design of KBSs. We argue that algebraic specification as a hybrid knowledge specification formalism together with the objectoriented design method provide the properties that can support formal reasoning for KBSs. We refer to the class of KBSs whose development start from an explicit model of expertise. We describe a framework where the explicit model can be formalized and then refined. Refinement proceeds from a high-level to a low-level specification in a correctness preserving manner, towards an implementation. We present a minimal theory of refinement which allows one to establish via formal argument that system requirements, class specifications and classes are connected by a series of refinements.
