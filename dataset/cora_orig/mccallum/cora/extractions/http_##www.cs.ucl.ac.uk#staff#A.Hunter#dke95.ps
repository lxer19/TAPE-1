Abstract: Classical logic has many appealing features for knowledge representation and reasoning. But unfortunately it is flawed when reasoning about inconsistent information, since anything follows from a classical inconsistency. This problem is addressed by introducing the notions of "argument" and of "acceptability" of an argument. These notions are used to introduce the concept of "argumentative structures". Each definition of acceptability selects a subset of the set of arguments, and an argumentative structure is a subset of the power set of arguments. In this paper, we consider, in detail, a particular argumentative structure, where each argument is defined as a classical inference together with the applied premisses. For such arguments, a variety of definitions of acceptability are provided, the properties of these definitions are explored, and their inter-relationship described. The definitions of acceptability induce a family of logics called argumentative logics which we explore. The relevance of this work is considered and put in a wider perspective.

Reference-contexts: Such labels can be used to facilitate selection of preferred subsets of the database, and if propagated by the 22 proof rules, they can be used to facilitate selection of preferred inferences. The use of labelling has been motivated by the approach of labelled deductive systems <ref> (Gabbay 1991) </ref>, and has been developed to capture the general notion of priorities in non-monotonic reasoning (Hunter 1992). Priorities allow for more sophisticated, and arguably more appropriate handling of inconsistent and default information.

Reference-contexts: The use of labelling has been motivated by the approach of labelled deductive systems (Gabbay 1991), and has been developed to capture the general notion of priorities in non-monotonic reasoning <ref> (Hunter 1992) </ref>. Priorities allow for more sophisticated, and arguably more appropriate handling of inconsistent and default information. Initial investigations indicate that priorities should provide interesting developments of argumentative structures and argumentative logics (Elvang-Goransson et al 1993).

Reference-contexts: Although, we use simple definitions of arguments and acceptability, these concepts carry many possibilities for further refinement. It remains to be seen whether there is a general taxonomy of argumentative structures <ref> (Pinkas and Loui 1992) </ref> and universal properties of the logics that they induce. 8 Acknowledgements Anthony Hunter is currently being funded by CEC ESPRIT BRA MEDLAR2 and CEC ESPRIT BRA DRUMS2 Projects.
