Abstract: Consideration of dynamics is critical in the analysis, design, and control of robot systems. This article presents an extensive study of the dynamic properties of several important classes of robotic structures and proposes a number of general dynamic strategies for their coordination and control. This work is a synthesis of both previous and new results developed within the task-oriented operational space formulation. Here we introduce a unifying framework for the analysis and control of robotic systems beginning with an analysis of inertial properties based on two models that independently describe the mass and inertial characteristics associated with linear and angular motions. To visualize these properties, we propose a new geometric representation, termed the belted ellipsoid, that displays the magnitudes of the mass/inertial properties directly rather than their square roots. Our study of serial macro/mini structures is based on two models of redundant mechanisms. The first is a description of the task-level dynamics that results from projecting the system dynamics into operational space. The second is a unique dynamically consistent relationship between end-effector forces and joint torques. It divides control torques at the joint level into two dynamically decoupled vectors: torques that correspond to forces at the end effector, and torques that affect only internal motions. The analysis of inertial properties of macro/mini-manipulator systems reveals another important characteristic: that of reduced effective inertia. We show that the effective mass/inertia of a macro/mini-manipulator is bounded above by the mass/inertia of the mini-manipulator alone. Because mini structures have a limited range of motion, we also propose a dextrous dynamic coordination strategy to allow full use of the high mechanical bandwidth of the mini-structures in extended-motion operations. Finally, a study of the dynamics of parallel, multi-arm structures reveals an important additive property. The effective mass and inertia of a multi-arm system at some operational point are shown to be given by the sum of the effective masses and inertias associated with the object and each arm. Using this property, the

Reference-contexts: However, the limitations of joint-space control techniques, especially in constrained motion tasks, have motivated alternative approaches for dealing with task-level dynamics and control (Takase 1977; Luh, Walker, and Paul 1980; Hogan 1984). The operational space formulation <ref> (Khatib 1980, 1987) </ref>, which falls within this line of research, has been driven by the need to develop mathematical models for the description, analysis, and control of robot dynamics with respect to task behavior. <p> This yields fl (x) = J T (q)A (q)J 1 (q): (2) The matrix fl (x), along with its partial derivatives with respect to the operational coordinates (coefficients of centrifugal and Coriolis forces), and the gravity forces acting at the operational point establish the equations of motion <ref> (Khatib 1980) </ref> for the effector subjected to operational forces, F. <p> With equation (9), the dynamics of the end effector is described with respect to linear and angular velocities. Therefore, a task transformation of the description of end-effector orientation is needed. Such a transformation involves the inverse of E (x) and its derivatives <ref> (Khatib 1980) </ref>. 2.2 Unified Motion and Force Control Equation (9) is the basis for the development of the unified framework for motion and force control. <p> Nevertheless, the dynamic behavior of the end effector itself can still be described, and its equations of motion in operational space can still be established. In fact, the structure of the effector dynamic model has been shown <ref> (Khatib 1980, 1987) </ref> to be identical to that obtained in the case of non-redundant manipulators (equation (3)).

Reference-contexts: We construct the potential function V Dextrous (q) = k d n X q i + q i ! 2 23 where k d is a constant gain. The gradient of this function Dextrous = rV Dextrous ; (54) provides the required attraction <ref> (Khatib 1986) </ref> to the mid-range joint positions of the mini-manipulator. The interference of these additional torques with the end-effector dynamics is avoided by projecting them into the null space of J T (q). <p> This is nd = I n J T (q)J (q) Dextrous : (55) In addition, joint limit avoidance can be achieved using an "artificial potential field" function <ref> (Khatib 1986) </ref>. It is essential that the range of motion of the joints associ ated with the mini-manipulator accommodate the relatively slower dynamic response of the arm. A sufficient margin of motion is required to achieve dextrous dynamic coordination. <p> Asymptotic stabilization (Khatib 1987), dextrous dynamic coordination, link collision avoidance <ref> (Khatib 1986) </ref>, and control of manipulator postures can all be integrated in the vector i 0 , which causes no acceleration at the operational point. 8 Summary and Discussion This article has presented a study of dynamics and control for robotic systems involving redundant series and parallel kinematic structures.

Reference-contexts: When the effector and manipulator have both the same degree of freedom (i.e., n = m), the operational coordinates, x, form a set of generalized coordinates for the mechanism <ref> (Khatib 1987) </ref> in a domain of the workspace that excludes the kinematic singularities. <p> The Jacobian matrix J (q) associated with a given selection, x, of operational coordinates can be expressed <ref> (Khatib 1987) </ref> as J (q) = E (x)J 0 (q); (4) where the matrix J 0 (q), termed the basic Jacobian, is defined independently of the particular set of parameters used to describe the end-effector configuration, whereas the matrix E (x) is dependent on those parameters. <p> Such tasks are described by the generalized selection matrix and its complement associated with motion control and force control, respectively <ref> (Khatib 1987) </ref>. Using equation (9), the end-effector/sensor equations of motion can be written as fl 0 (x) _ # + 0 (x; #) + p 0 (x) + F contact = F 0 : (10) The vector F contact represents the contact forces acting at the end effector. <p> The dynamic decoupling and motion control of the augmented object in operational space is achieved by selecting a control structure similar to that of a single manipulator <ref> (Khatib 1987) </ref>, F = b fl (x)F ? + b (x; _x) + b p (x); (68) where b fl (x), b (x; _x), and b p (x) represent the estimates of fl (x), (x; _x), and p (x). <p> Asymptotic stabilization <ref> (Khatib 1987) </ref>, dextrous dynamic coordination, link collision avoidance (Khatib 1986), and control of manipulator postures can all be integrated in the vector i 0 , which causes no acceleration at the operational point. 8 Summary and Discussion This article has presented a study of dynamics and control for robotic systems involving

Reference-contexts: Because of the actuator redundancy of multi-effector systems, there is an infinity of joint-torque vectors that correspond to this force. In tasks involving large and heavy objects, a useful criterion for force distribution is minimization of total actuator activities <ref> (Khatib 1988) </ref>. In contrast, dextrous manipulation requires accurate control of internal forces.

Reference-contexts: However, the high performance of a mini-manipulator is only available within the mechanically limited range of its joint motions. An effective coordination strategy between the macro and mini structures is therefore essential for extending this performance to tasks covering a wide range of motions <ref> (Khatib 1990) </ref>. This article analyzes the inertial properties of macro/mini-manipulator systems and present a general methodology for their coordination and control. 2 Another area in which dynamics plays a critical role is multi-arm robot systems. Multi--arm control has generally been treated as a motion coordination problem. <p> That is, for joint torques associated with the null space in equation (19) not to produce any operational acceleration, it is necessary that J (q)A 1 (q) I J T (q)J # T i A generalized inverse of J (q) satisfying the above constraint is said to be dynamically consistent <ref> (Khatib 1990) </ref>. THEOREM 1. Dynamic Consistency. A generalized inverse that is consistent with the dynamic constraint of equation (21), J (q), is unique and is given by J (q) = A 1 (q)J T (q)fl (q): (22) The proof is based on a straightforward analysis of equation (21). <p> The equality of the inertial properties in Theorem 2 is obtained for mechanisms that involve only prismatic joints <ref> (Khatib 1990) </ref>. 5.3 Dextrous Dynamic Coordination The dynamic performance of a macro/mini-manipulator system can be made comparable to (and, in some cases, better than) that of the lightweight mini-manipulator.
