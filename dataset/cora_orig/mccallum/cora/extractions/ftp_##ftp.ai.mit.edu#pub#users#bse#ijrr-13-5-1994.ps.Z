Abstract: The forces of contact during manipulation convey substantial information about the state of the manipulation. Textures, slip, impacts, grasping, and other contact conditions produce force and position signatures that can be used for identifying the state of contact. This paper address the fundamental problems of interpreting the force signals without any additional context on the state of manipulation. Techniques based on forms of the generalized sequential likelihood ratio test are used to segment individual strain signals into statistically equivalent pieces. The results of the segmentation are designed to be used in a higher level procedure which will interpret the results within a manipulation context. We report on our experimental development of the segmentation algorithm and on its results for detecting and labelling impacts, slip, changes in texture, and condition. The sequential likelihood ratio test is reviewed and some of its special cases and optimal properties are discussed. Finally, we conclude by discussing extensions to the techniques and lessons for sensor design. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: Asymptotically this is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood minus k 2 log n: For auto-regressive (AR) processes this procedure was shown to be strongly consistent (asymptotically) by Hemerly and Davis [11]. No such result exists for the still popular, and useful, alternative AIC procedure derived by Akaike <ref> [1] </ref>. Akaike suggested that the decision criterion should be based on maximizing the expected value of the log-likelihood. When all the models use the same underlying probabil ity distribution, the penalty becomes the difference in expected log-likelihood between two competing models when the actual signal is white noise.

Reference-contexts: This area has been an active area of research in statistics and signal processing since its initial development by Wald [28]. A mathematical review is given by Siegmund [25]. There have been a number of important results during the last decade <ref> [3, 29] </ref>. These methods are relevant to any signal processing task which can be modeled as a stochastic measurement process on an underlying system which undergoes discontinuous changes. The methods are particularly useful when accurate and rapid decisions about the time of change are required.

Reference-contexts: This problem is very important. Many problems can be reduced to this problem by appropriate preprocessing. In addition, all estimation procedures give rise to an asymptotically local procedure which looks like a test for change in mean <ref> [4] </ref>. Finally, we consider the problem of multiple parameterized distributions. This is the form of our dynamic sensing algorithm takes. The procedure requires a technique for uniformly penalizing the number of free parameters, and we adopt the minimum description length principle.

Reference-contexts: This research looked at labeling some simple events without context. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the discrimination of contact events and the first application of sequential decision theory to this problem. Although we applied the techniques to signals from an intrinsic contact sensor <ref> [5] </ref>, the ideas can be applied to any form of tactile sensor to enhance performance. Based on the experimental results in this paper, we are investigating a sensor that is a combination of the intrinsic contact sensor and a piezoelectric film.

Reference-contexts: They found that the piezoelectric sensor was very sensitive to the changes in tangential strain associated with slip, and that the accelerometer was fairly sensitive to the vibrations normal to the sensor associated with slip. Bicchi <ref> [6] </ref> used a six-axis fingertip force-torque sensor to estimate the onset of slip (figure 2). This sensor has a 1 Hz as a function of time. The signal was sampled at 2700 Hz. Sixty-four points windowed with a Hamming window were used for each fast fourier transform (fft).

Reference-contexts: Some research has looked at the information that can be acquired by actively moving the contact sensor and monitoring both the sensor and joint locations. This is termed haptic sensing. Primarily prior haptic research has focused on actively tracing the contours of objects to determine geometry and critical features <ref> [7, 27] </ref>. This work assumes that each measurement is taken with the force sensor in a quasi-static state so that normal forces and contact locations can be computed. All of this work essentially treats the tactile array sensor as a primitive form of vision.

Reference-contexts: In general, most robot programming has used an action centered paradigm. That is the programmer first determines the sequence of actions that should be performed and then determines how to use the available sensors to guide the actions. The guarded move is the typical sensing/action strategy that results. Brock <ref> [8] </ref> provides a recent study and review of this approach. This paper is based on a sensing centered programming paradigm. In this approach, the properties characteristic of the sensor signals alone are determined and then an event detector for changes in those properties is designed.

Reference-contexts: All of these sensing modalities are unique to contact force sensing. A few studies have been done on this type of sensing. By monitoring the acoustic emission from a metal gripper, Dornfeld <ref> [9] </ref> was able to detect the onset of slip for some metallic workpieces. Howe and Cutkowsky [12] constructed an instrumented latex covered finger. Piezoelectric sensors are embedded in the latex cover, and a miniature accelerometer is mounted on the inside surface of the cover.

Reference-contexts: At a fixed false alarm time, an increase in the signal to noise ratio will decrease the time to detection. The performance of the alternative test of lowpass filtering followed by thresholding can be bounded using the 9 following asymptotic approximation derived by Hall <ref> [10] </ref>. The approximations are valid in the limit of an increasing threshold and short sampling time. Consider a filter realized by a stable, linear, time invariant vector process x driven by a white, zero-mean, Gaussian noise w (k) with noise intensity Q.

Reference-contexts: Under his assumption the Bayes procedure chooses the a posteriori most probable model and parameter values. Asymptotically this is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood minus k 2 log n: For auto-regressive (AR) processes this procedure was shown to be strongly consistent (asymptotically) by Hemerly and Davis <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Based on the experimental results in this paper, we are investigating a sensor that is a combination of the intrinsic contact sensor and a piezoelectric film. This sensor, which is similar in design to <ref> [12] </ref>, has better dynamic characteristics and should give better performance. In the following sections, we first summarize the work that has been done on detecting grasping events and on human models of temporal tactile sensing. We then briefly discuss our experiments and the signal models. <p> All of these sensing modalities are unique to contact force sensing. A few studies have been done on this type of sensing.

Reference-contexts: We conclude by discussing the research issues in contact event perception, and our plans for future development. 2 Previous Work During the last decade, considerable research has been performed on tactile sensing. Howe <ref> [13] </ref> provides the most recent comprehensive review of current and past research. Most of this research has focused on designing surface array sensors and using these sensors for obtaining geometric information from static measurements. <p> All of this work essentially treats the tactile array sensor as a primitive form of vision. In contrast, a more recent type of contact sensor processing is the detection of information characteristic of the dynamic aspects of motion <ref> [13] </ref>. Mechanical properties of objects like mass, friction, and damping can only be determined by actively probing and manipulating the object. Similarly, the initial contact with an object, and slip between the sensors and environment require detecting relative motion. All of these sensing modalities are unique to contact force sensing.

A fair amount is known about the frequency response of these receptors to tightly defined inputs. The Merkel disks and the Meissner corpuscles are type I populations and are near the surface and closely spaced. These surface sensors are primarily sensitive to low frequency information.

Reference-contexts: The orthogonal parameter estimates are called the the reflection coefficients because they are related to the amount of energy reflected back at a changing impedance junction in an electrical transmission line <ref> [19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: All of these methods generally make decisions about the contact state based on the instantaneous values of the measured signals. In some cases, a lowpass filter may be introduced to reduce the "noise" in the signal. One exception is McCarragher <ref> [20] </ref>. McCarragher examined the planar assembly process and constructed a discrete event dynamic system controller to make decisions about the current configuration of the parts based on the history of force measurements.

Reference-contexts: The log of these prior probabilities adds to the likelihood calculation and essential creates an a priori model cost. What the likelihood approach requires is a principle for choosing these model costs.

This principle states that the cost of the model is related to the number of parameters or bits it takes to encode the model.

Reference-contexts: An equivalent result was derived by Schwarz <ref> [23] </ref>. Schwarz derived an asymptotic expansion to the optimal Bayes procedure by assuming a fixed error cost and fairly general conditions for the prior distribution and the sample distributions. Under his assumption the Bayes procedure chooses the a posteriori most probable model and parameter values.

Reference-contexts: When all the models use the same underlying probabil ity distribution, the penalty becomes the difference in expected log-likelihood between two competing models when the actual signal is white noise. For parameter estimation problems, this gives a penalty equal to the number of free parameters. For AR processes, Shibata <ref> [24] </ref> derived the distribution of the number of free parameters estimate, ^ k, using this penalty. The result shows that the most probable ^ k equals k but that the expected value of k is generally closer to k + 1.

The spatial distribution of the contact is of only secondary importance. Relative motion of very small raised dots (4 m high, 550 m diameter single dots, and 1 m dots spaced at 100 m center-to-center) on a smooth plate produced reliable activation of the fibers.
