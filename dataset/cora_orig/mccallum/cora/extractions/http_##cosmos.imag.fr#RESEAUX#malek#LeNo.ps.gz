Abstract: The goal of our work is to develop a computer assisted medical diagnosis system in the field of neuropathy (peripheral nervous system diseases). We believe that an efficient medical diagnosis system must integrate the divers reasoning capacities of physicians : logical, deductive, uncertain, and analogical reasoning. A neuropathy diagnosis system based on production rules, called Neurop, has already been developed in our laboratory. However, Neurop is poorly adapted to treat uncertain data or unusual cases. In this paper, we propose integration of a new module of analogical reasoning to compensate the drawbacks presented by Neurop. The idea is to memorise real treated cases and to construct what we call a memory of prototype cases. This memory is then used during retrieval phase. A learning phase is added to optimise the system reaction and to prevent future diagnostic failures. This is achieved by modifying the contents of the prototype memory. Three principal types of modifications are offered. They are : prototype construction, prototype specialisation and prototype fusion. The proposed reasoning system is planned to function in conjunction with another reasoning system (that could be a human expert) which supervises results and activates the learning mechanisms in case of failure.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen to introduce a new type of reasoning based on analogy and generalisation of examples. This resolves the problem of uncertain cases and completes the expert system by integrating another type of reasoning. We mention here that there exists in the literature several prototype-based systems like Protos <ref> [1] </ref> and ARC [7] which was applied to medical diagnosis and which used fuzzy logic. Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: To compensate for Neurop's shortcomings we propose adding a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) module. CBR is based on the recognition of similarity between a given problem, and one that has already been resolved <ref> [2] </ref>. The solution found must be adapted to the case under study. Case structure depends on the application domain and must include aspects allowing for measurement of similarities. A CBR system is composed of three main phases [11]: The retrieval phase, which permits retrieval of relevant cases from the memory.

Reference-contexts: An atypical case of analogical reasoning that was studied and applied to some specific diagnosis or planning problems is Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)[11]. Another type of reasoning that is strongly related to analogical reasoning is reasoning based on generalisation from examples and on inductive approaches <ref> [3] </ref>. Actually, we are interested in a specific medical field: the electromyography (cf. 2). A system of aid on neuropathy diagnosis based on production rules, has been designed and implemented. This system, called Neurop uses rule-based knowledge representation and deductive reasoning [9].

Reference-contexts: Resolving a new case, using this type of knowledge, is achieved by using analogical reasoning [6] which is based on the deduction of a behaviour in a new situation in function of mem-orised information.

Reference-contexts: Indexing methods determine important features of cases according to the knowledge domain. Unfortunately, this type of knowledge is not always available. Inductive approaches are more suitable when there is a large case memory. They allow the construction of classification tools or architectures, like decision trees <ref> [8] </ref> which allow an automatic analysis of the new case features with logarithmic complexity. Organising cases in some generalisation hierarchy is an important method for building the case memory [11].

Reference-contexts: Actually, we are interested in a specific medical field: the electromyography (cf. 2). A system of aid on neuropathy diagnosis based on production rules, has been designed and implemented. This system, called Neurop uses rule-based knowledge representation and deductive reasoning <ref> [9] </ref>. Being a rule-based system, Neurop presents two major drawbacks: Due to the absence of memorisation of real treated cases, Neurop repeats the same steps even if an already treated case is presented once more. - Neurop is not able to treat atypical or uncertain cases (Sect. 2). <p> In section four, we present our case and prototype structures, and in section five, we describe the learning methods: prototype construction, prototype specialisation and prototype fusion. 2 Application Field and Related Work Neuropathy is an important part of electromyography, a medical discipline that concerns the study of neuromuscular diseases <ref> [9] </ref>. Four pairs of nerves are particularly tested: the median, the ulnar, the peroneal and the tibial. For each nerve, sensory and motor fibres are studied independently. To localise lesions, we proceed by studying the nerve segment by segment. <p> The global patient diagnosis is a synthesis of all tested nerve diagnoses. Neurop is an expert system for neuropathy diagnosis aid. It contains rules that treat the following four levels of neuropathy diagnosis <ref> [9] </ref>: interpretation of parameters, segment diagnoses, nerve diagnoses and patient diagnosis. The electrophysiological parameters are continuous. They are interpreted by semantic values that take their values in one of the following sets: (normal, decreased very decreased) or (normal, increased, very increased).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this work, we aim to provide a medical diagnosis system that integrates divers reasoning capacities of physician's such as : logical, deductive, uncertain, and analogical reasoning. In fact, two main sources of knowledge are generally used by a physician when examining a new patient case <ref> [10] </ref>: Academic knowledge, where conclusions are deduced by applying certain production rules to an initial set of factors describing the examined case. Practical experience, where knowledge may be presented by an accumulation of conclusions about already treated cases.
