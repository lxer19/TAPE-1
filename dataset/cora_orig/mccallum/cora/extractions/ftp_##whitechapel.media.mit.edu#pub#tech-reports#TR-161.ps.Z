Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory Vision and Modeling Technical Report #161. Appears in: IEEE Trans. Information Theory, vol. 38(2), pp. 587-607, March 1992. Abstract Orthogonal wavelet transforms have recently become a popular representation for multi-scale signal and image analysis. One of the major drawbacks of these representations is their lack of translation invariance: the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal, and in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. We formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance that we call "shiftability". In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be considered in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. We explore "jointly shiftable" transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a one-dimensional transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a two-dimensional transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. We demonstrate the usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement.

Reference-contexts: These functions are therefore related by modulation in the frequency domain. In order to create representations more suited for analysis of scale, many authors in signal processing and computer vision as well as biological vision have advocated transforms with constant logarithmic-width (constant Q) frequency bands <ref> [19, 31, 48, 24, 1, 34, 28] </ref>. The basis functions of such a transform are related by dilation operations. <p> For example, consider convolution with the interval integration kernel, h (x) = 1; x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; 0; otherwise; followed by sampling at unit intervals. This system will clearly have flat basis function power, since the power of each basis function is one over its interval, and the functions do not overlap.

We can now see that the steerable pyramid transform is (approximately) self-inverting over the lowpass range of radial frequencies ! r 2 <ref> [0; 2 ] </ref>. When applying the oriented filters in two dimensions, the convolution results are not spatially subsampled. These subbands are therefore spatially shiftable. The lowpass radial filters were designed to prevent aliasing, and so the subsampled lowpass signal is also spatially shiftable.

Reference-contexts: For some applications, we need to employ quadrature pairs of filters that have the same frequency response but differ in phase by 2 radians (i.e. pairs of filters that are Hilbert transforms of each other <ref> [4] </ref>). Since the cos 3 () frequency response is odd-symmetric, its Hilbert transform is j cos 3 ()j.

The highpass portion may be subsampled as in wavelet pyramids, or left at full density as in the Laplacian pyramid <ref> [5] </ref>. A single stage of the transform may be written in the form of a standard analysis/synthesis filter bank [41] (although the Laplacian pyramid is typically not implemented using this architecture). The filters are chosen such that this single-stage system behaves like an identity operation.

Reference-contexts: These coefficients can be modified according to the likelihood that they represent signal rather than noise. The "cleaned" image can then be constructed by inverting the transform. (see, for example, <ref> [37, 23, 6] </ref>). Natural images tend to contain locally oriented structures such as lines, edges, and textures, while noise tends to be isotropic (i.e., without preferred orientation). <p> If the oriented energy is large, the pyramid coefficient at that orientation is left unchanged; otherwise it is be attenuated. To perform this operation, we use a soft threshold function similar to that described in <ref> [6] </ref>: ^c i = (1 + exp (S ( e i T ))) where c i is the coefficient at a particular orientation, e i is the energy at that orientation, and S and T are sharpness and threshold parameters that are chosen for each subband.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the term wavelet is usually assumed to refer to an orthonormal basis set. Prior to the development of wavelets, octave-width subband transforms based on quadrature mirror filters (QMFs) were developed in the signal processing community <ref> [7, 13, 45, 44, 46, 39, 29] </ref>. In the discrete domain, pyramids constructed from QMFs may be considered as wavelet transforms, although they are often only approximately orthonormal. They have been used for various tasks requiring multi-scale signal analysis, and have been found especially effective for data compression.

Reference-contexts: Self-Invertibility Orthonormal transforms are self-inverting, but self-inverting transforms need not be orthonor-mal. As we stated in section 2, orthonormality is the combination of self-inversion and linear independence. One can construct transforms which are self-inverting, yet overcomplete. Daubechies has termed these "tight frames" <ref> [8] </ref>. A trivial example serves to demonstrate that such transforms exist. A non-orthogonal, self-inverting transform may be formed from any orthogonal transform by duplicating every projection function and dividing the kernel weights by a factor of p 2.

Reference-contexts: However, the situation turns out to be rather complex. To illustrate this point, we consider the case of spatial translation. We take as our transform a three-level pyramid constructed using the discrete dyadic Daubechies wavelet kernel <ref> [9] </ref> of length four. The input signal is shown at the top of figure 1 (a). For illustrative purposes, we have chosen this signal to be equal to one of the wavelet basis functions in the second subband. Thus, its transform is a single impulse within that subband. <p> An advantage of their technique is the computational efficiency of the recursive pyramid structure. In an independent context, mathematicians developed a form of continuous function representation called wavelets <ref> [20, 9, 10] </ref>. The defining characteristic of a wavelet transform is that the basis functions are translations and dilations of a common kernel (see [42] for an introduction). Thus, the wavelet transform performs a scale decomposition similar to the Laplacian pyramid.

We do not, however, need to abandon the property of self-inversion. <p> The following proposition (adapted from <ref> [15] </ref>) describes a condition under which the transformation is shiftable, and gives an analytic expression for the interpolation functions. <p> Invertibility of the matrix places a lower bound on the number of samples, N , required for shiftability. In particular, the number of samples must be greater than or equal to the number of non-zero Fourier components of the function h (x), as discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>. For example, consider one stage of a discrete dyadic wavelet transform. If the original signal is of length (period) N samples, the highpass subband computed from this signal will contain N=2 samples. <p> Given a set of basis functions centered at the same spatial location and scale, and tuned to a finite number of orientations, we wish to interpolate measurements at all orientations. This problem has been studied in detail by Freeman and Adelson <ref> [15] </ref>, who described a general framework for continuously rotating filters. They discuss the number of rotated basis functions required to "steer" a given filter (i.e. the number of samples in the orientation domain), and derive the interpolation formula given in equation (5). <p> Figure 7 (f ) shows the zero-crossings of the scale-space function. Note that the horizontal density of zero-crossings decreases as the scale becomes coarser. 5 Two-dimensional Example: A Steerable Pyramid We have designed and implemented a two-dimensional transform that is jointly shiftable in orientation and position (see also <ref> [15] </ref>). The basis functions are translations, dilations, and rotations of a single kernel, and the transform is constructed as a recursive pyramid. Figure 8 contains an illustration of the frequency domain decomposition performed by the transform. <p> Therefore, by proposition 5, the pyramid is self-inverting. 6 Image Processing Applications Since the steerable pyramid is jointly shiftable in orientation and position, one can perform useful image analysis and manipulation directly on the transform representation. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the steerable pyramid representation was used to infer surface shape from image intensities (known as the "shape-from-shading" problem). Here, we demonstrate its use in two more applications. <p> We use the steerability of the image representation to ensure that the noise processing is independent of image orientation. At each scale and position, we analytically find the local dominant orientation from the quadrature pair of steerable filters <ref> [15] </ref>. For the case of a single oriented structure this is the orientation which maximizes the energy measure e i . We then steer each of the odd phase steerable pyramid filters so that one of them is aligned with the dominant orientation.

Reference-contexts: A function that is simultaneously tuned for several parameters is said to be jointly localized in those parameters. The concept of joint localization in space and spatial frequency was introduced by Gabor in 1946 <ref> [16] </ref>. He derived a lower bound for a particular measure of joint localization, and determined the unique set of functions (products of sinusoids and Gaussians) that achieve this limit 1 .

Reference-contexts: In this case, the interpolation functions are multi-dimensional. This is true, for example, in a wavelet transform: One can interpolate any point in the scale-position parameter space from a set of surrounding scale and position samples. This was done in a recent paper by Gopinath and Burrus <ref> [18] </ref>. In the present paper, however, we have emphasized the advantages of being able to shift independently, so that one parameter may be shifted while holding all others fixed. This property is important in many signal analysis applications, as we discuss in later sections.

For these reasons, the steerable pyramid representation described in the previous section is well-suited for image enhancement. Shiftability in orientation and space allow all orientations and positions to be treated uniformly. The multi-scale nature of the representation allows the processing to depend on the spatial frequency band.

Reference-contexts: We note that since the power spectra of both filters of the quadrature pair are identical, either set of filters can be used in the implementation of the pyramid. Two-dimensional Filter Design Using the frequency transformation method <ref> [26] </ref>, we converted the one-dimensional radial filters into two-dimensional filters. Figure 13 (b) shows the two-dimensional bandpass filter. 23 The frequency transformation method produces two-dimensional filters with only approximate circular symmetry, but the approximation is quite accurate over the passband of our filters.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the term wavelet is usually assumed to refer to an orthonormal basis set. Prior to the development of wavelets, octave-width subband transforms based on quadrature mirror filters (QMFs) were developed in the signal processing community <ref> [7, 13, 45, 44, 46, 39, 29] </ref>. In the discrete domain, pyramids constructed from QMFs may be considered as wavelet transforms, although they are often only approximately orthonormal. They have been used for various tasks requiring multi-scale signal analysis, and have been found especially effective for data compression. <p> Several other authors have developed non-orthogonal oriented multi-scale transforms in which the basis functions are translations and rotations of a common function [12, 19, 32, 47]. As mentioned in the introduction, one major drawback of using wavelets (or QMFs) for signal processing applications is their lack of translation invariance <ref> [29, 42] </ref>. In the next section, we address this problem by defining shiftability, a generalization of both the sampling theorem and the steerability property introduced by Freeman and Adelson [14, 15]. We discuss this property in the context of different image transform parameters: position, scale, and orientation.

Reference-contexts: Note the drastic change in the coefficients of the transform, both within and between subbands. 2 stereo matching problem, Mallat addressed this problem by building a translation-invariant representation from the zero-crossings of the full-density wavelet subbands <ref> [30] </ref>. The translation invariance issue serves as a starting point for our discussion, but one of the purposes of this paper is to show that this problem may also be considered in other domains. <p> Altering the coefficients in a coordinate system defined by the local dominant orientation ensures that the image will be processed in a rotation-invariant manner. intensity values are in the range <ref> [30; 224] </ref>. Figure 15 (b) shows the image corrupted by white noise uniformly distributed on the interval [20; 20]. The SNR for this image is 12.42 dB, 28 or 13.6 dB peak-to-peak.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, one should be able to compute (interpolate) the full convolution output from the set of retained samples. It is well-known that the lower bound on the sampling rate that meets this condition is the Nyquist rate: the frequency bandwidth of the kernel h (x) <ref> [33] </ref>. Thus, in the spatial domain, shiftability of a sampled representation corresponds to the lack of aliasing. We derive an alternative form of the sampling theorem that makes explicit a set of analytic interpolation functions that can be used to perform the shifting operation. <p> To construct a set of oriented filters, we subdivide the annular bandpass spectrum into orientation subbands. The angular variation is sufficiently slow to use the frequency sampling method <ref> [33] </ref>. We computed the Fourier transform of the bandpass kernel, multiplied by the four desired angular responses, cos 3 ( n ), and computed the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the basis filter impulse responses. Figures 13 (c)-(f) show the frequency responses of the bandpass filters.

Reference-contexts: They developed a technique to synthesize kernels of arbitrary orientation from linear combinations of a fixed set of oriented basis kernels, and they called these basis sets "steerable" filters. They describe the conditions under which a given set of rotated basis functions is steerable. Perona <ref> [35] </ref> has described an alternative formulation of the steerability property and recently extended this to the analysis of scale. Multi-scale analysis has been another important topic in signal processing. The basis functions of Gabor's original transform were chosen to cover equal-width frequency bands.

Reference-contexts: These structures may appear at any relative phase: even-phase (lines), odd-phase (edges), or contours of intermediate phase. A local "oriented energy" measure, formed by the sum of squares of a quadrature pair of even- and odd-phase filters, will treat structures of different phases uniformly (cf. <ref> [36] </ref>). Thus, we construct two steerable pyramids, one using odd-symmetric filters, and the other using their even-symmetric Hilbert transform counterparts, and use the sum of squares of the coefficients at each position, orientation and scale to measure orientation strength.

Reference-contexts: These coefficients can be modified according to the likelihood that they represent signal rather than noise. The "cleaned" image can then be constructed by inverting the transform. (see, for example, <ref> [37, 23, 6] </ref>). Natural images tend to contain locally oriented structures such as lines, edges, and textures, while noise tends to be isotropic (i.e., without preferred orientation).

Reference-contexts: Having specified the two lowpass filters, the bandpass filter is constrained by the recur sion relation given in equation (14). We designed a symmetric 15-tap bandpass filter that minimizes the maximum error amplitude. We used a simplex algorithm <ref> [38] </ref> to search the eight-dimensional space of free parameters.

A less trivial example of an overcomplete self-inverting transform based on an over-complete Gabor set is described by Simoncelli <ref> [39] </ref>. The "cortex" transform developed by Watson [47] is another example of an overcomplete self-inverting transform. The overcomplete steerable pyramid described in section 5 is also a self-inverting transform. Intuitively, the importance of self-invertibility is that it ascribes a natural meaning to the transform coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The highpass portion may be subsampled as in wavelet pyramids, or left at full density as in the Laplacian pyramid [5]. A single stage of the transform may be written in the form of a standard analysis/synthesis filter bank <ref> [41] </ref> (although the Laplacian pyramid is typically not implemented using this architecture). The filters are chosen such that this single-stage system behaves like an identity operation. The pyramid structure is achieved by applying this single-stage transform recur sively to the lowpass subband of the previous single-stage transform.

Reference-contexts: Since critically sampled subband transforms (such as wavelet transforms) typically violate the Nyquist criterion, the information moves from one band to another under translation. These issues have been raised elsewhere. Strang mentions the translation invariance problem as one of the primary weaknesses of the wavelet transform <ref> [42] </ref>.

The defining characteristic of a wavelet transform is that the basis functions are translations and dilations of a common kernel (see <ref> [42] </ref> for an introduction). Thus, the wavelet transform performs a scale decomposition similar to the Laplacian pyramid. Furthermore, it may be implemented in a recursive manner similar to the Laplacian pyramid. Finally, the term wavelet is usually assumed to refer to an orthonormal basis set. <p> Several other authors have developed non-orthogonal oriented multi-scale transforms in which the basis functions are translations and rotations of a common function [12, 19, 32, 47].

We discuss this property in the context of different image transform parameters: position, scale, and orientation.
