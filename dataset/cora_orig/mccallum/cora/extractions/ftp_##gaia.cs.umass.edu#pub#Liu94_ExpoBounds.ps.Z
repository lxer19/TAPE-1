Abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for computing upper and lower bounds of an exponential form for a large class of single resource systems with non-renewal inputs. Specifically, the bounds are on quantities such as backlog, queue length, and response time. The exponential upper bound is shown to exist if the process describing the system is stable. The optimum decay rate for the bound is obtained by establishing a large deviation result for this process. The paper concludes with several applications including admission control to multimedia systems such as high speed networks and video servers.

The previous work most closely related to ours is that of Duffield <ref> [9] </ref> which uses a martingale approach (similar to [26] for the G/G/1 queue) to obtain upper bounds similar to ours for the case of a Markovian environment. This approach does not appear easily to yield lower bounds or transient results, nor considers the problem of call admission. <p> For the first of these models, we present a more easily computable upper bound on buffer occupancy than previously reported in <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. These bounds can then be used to address the call 2 admission problem. For all of these cases, we also develop simple expressions for the effective bandwidths of a population of sources feeding the server.

First, a considerable amount of work has focussed on the development of algorithms for computing the response time distribution of a statistical multiplexer being fed by a Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) pioneered by Neuts [31] (see <ref> [14] </ref> for a recent survey of this area).

Reference-contexts: The call admission problem is then solved by checking whether the effective bandwidth of the aggregate user population, including the new user, exceeds the service capacity. The reader is referred to <ref> [16, 23, 17, 12, 5] </ref> for treatments of this problem. As an application of our model we will obtain results for the source models commonly encountered in the study of network and multimedia server performance. We apply our results to several systems that have received considerable prior attention. <p> This has been explored in a number of papers (see <ref> [17, 23, 12, 16] </ref>) where the notion has been formalized and established rigorously for several different QOS measures for a number of different application traffic models. In the following, we will only consider a buffer of infinite size.

Reference-contexts: These bounds can then be used to address the call 2 admission problem. For all of these cases, we also develop simple expressions for the effective bandwidths of a population of sources feeding the server. In the case of the MMPP, our results generalize those previously obtained in <ref> [12, 24] </ref>. The organization of the paper is as follows. Upper and lower bounds are derived in Section 2. This section includes a derivation of the largest exponential decay rate and a treatment of both transient and stationary regimes. It concludes with a demonstration of the tightness of the bounds. <p> Therefore, fi is an open set and Proposition 2.4 applies to give lim b!1 log P (X b)=b for 2 fi + if and only if 0 fl . Combining both results yields the proposition. | This result has been derived by Kesidis et al. <ref> [24] </ref> through a heuristic argument. <p> ! 1 implies that lim b!1 (log P (X b))=b if j=1 d j () c, which concludes the proof. | The above result has been obtained by Mitra and Elwalid [12] for the case that all service times are identically distributed exponential r.v.s, and also by Kesidis et al. <ref> [24] </ref> through an heuristic argument for a simpler traffic pattern. 3.3 Markov Modulated Fluid Processes Consider a single MMFP [12] with finite state-space S = f1; 2; : : :; Kg and irreducible infinitesimal generator Q = [q ij ], serviced by a channel of constant capacity c which is equipped <p> This result was first obtained by Gibbens and Hunt [17] in a special case, and later by Elwalid and Mitra [12]. It was also derived by Kesidis, Walrand and Chang <ref> [24] </ref> through an heuristic argument. 3.4 Call Admission We consider two applications of the above analysis to call admission in multimedia systems. The first is to the admission of voice calls to a single T1 (1.536Mbs) channel.

Reference-contexts: Appendices A Proof of Lemma 2.1 We already know from Kingman <ref> [25] </ref> that log (()) is convex in fi, so that () is convex fi. We show by contradiction that () is actually strictly convex in . Assume that () is not strictly convex in fi.

Reference-contexts: We also want the coefficients a, b and to be easily computable so that on-line computations may be carried out.

The previous work most closely related to ours is that of Duffield [9] which uses a martingale approach (similar to <ref> [26] </ref> for the G/G/1 queue) to obtain upper bounds similar to ours for the case of a Markovian environment. This approach does not appear easily to yield lower bounds or transient results, nor considers the problem of call admission.

Reference-contexts: This is a difficult problem and one approach taken is to divide the end-to-end QOS requirement among all of the hops and perform call admission at each hop (e.g., <ref> [16, 13, 30] </ref>). Thus, if any one hop decides not to admit the call, the call is not admitted end-to-end. Under this approach, it suffices to consider the call admission problem for a single channel.
