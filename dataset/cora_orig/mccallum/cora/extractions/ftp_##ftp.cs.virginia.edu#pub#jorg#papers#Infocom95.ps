Abstract: Many network applications that require Quality-of-Service (QoS) support, such as transmission of digital voice and video, tolerate a certain level of service degradation. In this study, a novel network service, referred to as service with bounded degradation (BD service), is presented that can take advantage of the delay tolerance of applications. Different from previous proposals for similar services, the BD service can guarantee hard lower bounds of the service degradation. This is achieved by strictly limiting the amount of traffic that is subject to service degradation. To implement a BD service, network traffic is partitioned into components with different delay requirements. Policing of the traffic components is achieved by multi-level leaky buckets. A novel scheduler, referred to as EDD-BD (Earliest Deadline Due Bounded Degradation) scheduler, performs switching of packets. Properties of the EDD-BD scheduler are presented and analyzed.

The network verifies if the requested QoS can be guaranteed. <p> Since many network clients do not require that service commitments be guaranteed for all packets of a connection, a QoS network architecture offers several levels of service commitments. At the highest level, a so-called deterministic service <ref> [2] </ref> guarantees that performance requirements are met for all packets at all times. <p> All architectures for QoS networks proposed in the literature offer a service with commitments that are weaker than a deterministic service, but stronger than a best effort service.

Probabilistically bounded QoS guarantees, similar to the statistical channel, have been studied in [3, 5]. <p> Admission control tests in the network must verify that the specified delay bounds can be supported <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. That is, the network must be able to determine if it can guarantee a maximum delay of d p for packets from the primary component, and a maximum delay of d s for packets from the secondary component.

Reference-contexts: As an example, transmission of digitized voice does not need reliable delivery, but can tolerate a limited number of packet losses. However, the amount of lost voice packets must be within application specific bounds; otherwise, the voice stream will be not intelligible at the receiver <ref> [4] </ref>. Therefore, for voice applications neither the highest nor the lowest level of 1 Note that the network may, however, reserve certain resources, e.g., link bandwidth, for the class of all best-effort connections. performance guarantees is ideal.
