Title: Session Directories and Scalable Internet Multicast Address Allocation  
Author: Mark Handley 
Affiliation: USC Information Sciences Institute  
Abstract: A multicast session directory is a mechanism by which users can discover the existence of multicast sessions. In the Mbone, session announcements have also served as multicast address reservations a dual purpose that is efficient, but which may cause some side-affects as session directories scale. In this paper we examine the scaling of multicast address allocation when it is performed by such a multicast session directory. Despite our best efforts to make such an approach scale, this analysis ultimately reveals significant scaling problems, and suggests a new approach to multicast address allocation in the Internet environment.

Reference-contexts: This provides redundant backbone links which can be exploited to form source-based shortest path trees to simulate DVMRP and sparse and dense mode PIM. The resulting graph is very similar to those generated by Doar <ref> [1] </ref> and has a hierarchical structure, with a variable number of multiple paths that together make this class of simulations a reasonable model of the real internet.

Reference-contexts: If no other site responds before this time interval elapses, then a site sends. To investigate how long this delay should be, we simulated such a generic multicast request-response protocol. Similar mechanisms are used in SRM <ref> [2] </ref> but in the address allocation case the group is likely to be larger, the delay matrix unknown, and even the size of the receivership unknown.

Reference-contexts: As Mbone session directories such as sdr <ref> [5] </ref> are already advertising the existence of multicast sessions and their addresses to the appropriate scope zones, we have traditionally leveraged this distribution process as a part of a multicast address allocation mechanism.

Reference-contexts: To support these distinct groups we would like to dynamically allocate new announcement addresses for certain categories of announcement, and only announce the existence of the category on the base session directory address. This would function in a similar way to dynamic adaptive naming in CCCP <ref> [7] </ref>, and would allow receivers to decide the categories for which they receive announcements, and hence the bandwidth used by the session directory.

Reference-contexts: Instead of adjusting the distribution from which members choose a random delay, we can also use other natural differences to avoid performance for both uniform and exponential random delay multiple responses. Additional examination of one such approach can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>, but for this application, the approach above yields the best results. 4 Conclusions The announcement mechanism in sdr is extremely robust, and can be very timely (compared to alternative mechanisms).

Reference-contexts: We shall examine what may be achieved by an entirely distributed multicast address allocation scheme based on the existing session announcement architecture. Afterwards in summary we will examine alternatives including how this may be combined with a dynamic hierarchical scheme. 2.1 IPRMA Van Jacobson has partially described <ref> [9] </ref> a scheme for multicast address allocation called Informed Partitioned Random Multicast Address Allocation (IPRMA). This is intended to allow a session directory instance to locally generate a multicast address with minimal chance that this multicast address will conflict with another multicast address already in use. <p> Deterministic Adaptive Address Space Partitioning The major failing of adaptive IPRMA, as described above and in <ref> [9] </ref>, emerges from one of two circumstances. One way is for two or more TTLs of sessions fall into the same IPRMA address partition.
