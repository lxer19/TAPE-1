Title: Duality between finite distributive lattices and finite posets 1 A lattice is a poset D
Author: d &gt; D and D 
Note: for all d 2 D d d 0 a iff d a and d 0 a.  Definition 2  ff D 0 D such that ff (d 0 d iff d 0 ff(d); for all d 0 2 D 0 d 2 D. Dually, a right-adjoint of ff is a map ff D 0 D such that ff(d) d 0 iff d ff (d 0 Exercise E.2 Show that the left-adjoint of ff, if it exists, is unique. Prove a  0 are complete. Then ff preserves all meets iff it has a left-adjoint. Dually, ff preserves all joins iff it has a right-adjoint.  
Abstract: We have obvious inclusion functors DLat fin ! cDLat ! DLat. The first one is full and faithful, the second faithful but not full (!). Exercise E.1 A distributive lattice is complete iff it has all meets iff it has all joins. Does a similar statement hold for maps? Does a map of distributive lattices that preserves all meets preserve automatically all joins (sups)?
