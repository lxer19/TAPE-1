Abstract: Many package routing problems involve routing one set of pins to another set of pins in a single layer without regard to how the pins in each set are connected. We call this type of problem a Planar Pin Assignment and Routing Problem (PPARP). Unlike general routing problems which correspond to the NP-complete multi-commodity flow problem, the pin distribution problem seems to have a natural formulation as a single-commodity flow problem, which suggests that it can be solved efficiently. In this paper, we show that the problem is surprisingly NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: This task is repetitious and a good target for automation. Unfortunately, most routing programs cannot handle pin assignment. Previous work has addressed the topic of generating fan-in and fan-out patterns for arrays of pads and rings of pads <ref> [DD94, YD95] </ref>. The previous approaches have three main deficiencies: 1. They rely on the symmetry of the problem to generate solutions and cannot cope with missing, skewed, or arbitrarily placed bumps. 2.
