Abstract: As a methodology, computational modeling has hardly given rise to experimental studies that actually implement the theoretical constructs invoked by and utilized in acquisition studies. Nevertheless, computer modeling is a powerful tool for studying highly complex phenomena such as the intricate interactions between the language acquisition data and the process of parameter setting. A notable exception to this situation is Dresher & Kaye's (1990) computational model YOUPIE that incorporates a UG approach to the acquisition of a phonological subsystem, i.e. stress assignment as it is treated in metrical phonology. We analyze this model focusing mainly on the learning theory incorporated in the model, i.e. the way in which UG mediates between the data and the grammar constructed by the learner. This investigation will focus on two aspects of the learning theory. First of all, the requirements formulated with respect to the learning theory will be evaluated against their implementation in the actual model. We will note several mismatches between the two. Secondly, we present an empirical test of the model. The model's production component is used to generate a 'language' for each possible parameter setting. Then, the model's learning component is used to acquire the grammar of each individual language. The outcome of the experiment reveals several problems in empirical coverage of the model, and relates some of them to inherent design choices.

Reference-contexts: This quote captures the tremendous impact of the theory of Universal Grammar (henceforth UG) on the study of natural language acquisition. The study of syntax has largely been cast in the terms of the Chomskyan Principles and Parameters approach <ref> (Chomsky 1981, 1986) </ref>. To a lesser extent, the same is true for phonology as well, where a number of parametrized theories of stress have been proposed (Halle & Vergnaud 1987, Hayes 1981, 1987).

Reference-contexts: A notable exception is Dresher and Kaye's implementation of a UG grammar approach to stress acquisition <ref> (Dresher & Kaye 1990, henceforth D&K, see also Dresher 1992) </ref>. They consider the problem of stress acquisition a major testing ground for parameter based theories, because "the parameters of metrical theory exhibit intricate interactions which surpass in complexity the syntactic parameters studied so far.

Reference-contexts: We will investigate to what extent these requirements are met in the actual implementation. Secondly, we will present the results of an empirical test of the model. In several publications <ref> (see Dresher 1992, Dresher & Kaye 1990) </ref> YOUPIE is described in considerable detail. However, the discussion of the actual success of the model in acquiring the stress systems of various languages is fairly limited.

Reference-contexts: To a lesser extent, the same is true for phonology as well, where a number of parametrized theories of stress have been proposed (Halle & Vergnaud 1987, Hayes 1981, 1987). Recently, these theories have provided the background for psycholinguistic studies of L1 and L2 acquisition <ref> (Fikkert 1994, Archibald 1993) </ref>. <p> In addition to the core grammar, a language may have languagespecific constraints that lie outside the core grammar. As a reflection of the metrical universals, the core grammar does not account for languagespecific constraints. The latter may well be parametrized <ref> (Fikkert 1994) </ref>, but languagespecific peculiarities may as well arise from other sources: (i) effects of phonology, i.e. phonological processes may obscure the underlying stress pattern of a language.

Reference-contexts: One of the major innovations of metrical phonology as it evolved 1 from work by i.a. Liberman (1975) is that stress is not a phonemic feature of 1 We will restrict our discussion here to the approach adopted by D&K, viz. an analysis in terms of metrical trees <ref> (see also Hayes, 1981, Giegerich 1985, i.a.) </ref>. Though the details of various alternative formalisms differ, this does not affect the arguments developed in this paper in any substantial way. Kager (in press) provides a state-of-the-art overview of the metrical literature.

Reference-contexts: By making the final syllable extrametrical, the word's final foot can consist of the penultimate and antepenultimate syllables, and hence, antepenultimate stress becomes a possibility. Extrametricality is restricted to peripheral elements and is further constrained by a number of conditions <ref> (see Kager 1995) </ref>. A Computational Model of P&P 8 Parameter P8A captures the fact that a language may or may not have an extrametrical peripheral syllable, and parameter P8 refers to the right and the left peripheral elements that may be extrametrical.
