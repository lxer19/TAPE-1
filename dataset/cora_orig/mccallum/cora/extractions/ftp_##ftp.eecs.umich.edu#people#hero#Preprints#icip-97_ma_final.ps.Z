Title: Detection of Curved Road Edges in Radar Images Via Deformable Templates  
Author: Bing Ma Sridhar Lakshmanan Alfred O. Hero 
Abstract: Three methods of detecting road edges in millimeter-wave radar images are presented in this paper. All of them are based on deformable template priors and random field likelihoods. The first method is formulated in a Bayesian setting and employs an adaptive MAP estimate. The second method is a modification of the first, using a novel weighting scheme. The third method is based on a three-region indicator matrix which is used to impose the non-linear constraints implicit on road geometry via addition of a sum of quasi-quadratic matrix forms to the log-normal likelihood. Unlike the first two methods, that employ the Metropolis algorithm to find the optimal road edges, the third method uses a deterministic recursive scheme designed to find the optimal indicator matrix. Experimental results are presented to show the advantages of these methods.

Reference-contexts: log-normal likelihood in Eqn.(3) is modified by re-substituting these estimated parameters back in, thereby making the method adaptive, (k fl ; m fl ; b fl R ) (k;m;b L ;b R ) The objective function in Eqn.(5) is non-concave with many local maxima, hence we employ the Metropolis algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> with a geometric annealing schedule [5] to per form this maximization, 1. Set i = 0, and initialize f k (0) ; m (0) ; b (0) (0) 2. Calculate L (i) = log P (k (i) ; m (i) ; b (i) (i) 3.
