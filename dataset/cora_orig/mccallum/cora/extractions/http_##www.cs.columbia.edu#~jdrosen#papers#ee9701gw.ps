Reference-contexts: In an international calling environment, the set of protocols and billing mechanisms supported by ITG's can be expected to vary. Some ITG's may support billing of IP hosts via credit cards or e-cash <ref> [1] </ref> on a per-usage basis. Others may require the IP hosts to have set up an account ahead of time. The ITG's will have to perform speech transcoding to convert the codec used by the IP host to either G.711 [2] (the standard used in the PSTN), or analog.

The ITG's will have to perform speech transcoding to convert the codec used by the IP host to either G.711 <ref> [2] </ref> (the standard used in the PSTN), or analog. There are many speech coders used by IP clients. These include the 8 kb/s G.729 standard [3], the 5.3/6.3 kb/s G.723 coder [4], the 16 kb/s G.728 LD-CELP coder [5], and any number of proprietary codecs.

There are also a whole host of higher rate, high quality speech coders, such as G.722 <ref> [6] </ref>. Since all ITG will not support all codecs, and since IP hosts may not all implement the same baseline codec, an IP host may need to select an ITG based on its speech coder support.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the speech coder, IP hosts may utilize a range of different signalling mechanisms for initiating and terminating calls, among other actions. ITG's must be able to recognize these protocols. H.323 <ref> [7] </ref> is gaining momentum as a popular standard for IP telephony. However, it is quite complicated, and other, more lightweight protocols exist. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [8] is an example of another signalling protocol for Internet telephony which is gaining acceptance.

Reference-contexts: of ITG services based on some database attributes, modification of these attributes by malicious parties can have huge business repercussions. 4 Alternatives Given these requirements, what are some possible protocol architectures which can meet the requirements? Here, we briefly discuss two: DNS and BGP. 4.1 DNS The Domain Name System <ref> [9] </ref> is used to map host names to IP addresses. It has also been used for mapping a service in a domain to a server which can provide that service [10]. Most relevant to ITG location problem is the tpc.int subdomain [11].

Reference-contexts: It has also been used for mapping a service in a domain to a server which can provide that service <ref> [10] </ref>. Most relevant to ITG location problem is the tpc.int subdomain [11]. The tpc.int subdomain allows a host to register a fax machine as providing fax service to a certain set of telephone numbers.

Reference-contexts: This relieves some of the network congestion and DNS processing requirements. It is also possible for DNS records to contain more than just the IP address of the ITG. In fact, resource records which can contain the "kitchen sink" including MIME data, ASN.1 data, and ASCII, are being defined <ref> [12] </ref>. These records can be used to contain compact descriptions of the protocol support, capabilities, and cost structure of the ITG.

Reference-contexts: It is extremely simple for clients and ITG's alike, as it is based on existing and well understood standards. 4.2 BGP BGP is the Border Gateway Protocol, and is specified in <ref> [15] </ref>. It is used for distribution of routes on a wide area network. It falls into the general class of routing protocols known as distance vector, based on the original distributed algorithm work of Bellman and Ford.

Reference-contexts: The architecture uses a scalable wide area multicast for distributing ITG advertisements. It builds upon the Service Location Protocol (SLP), recently released as RFC 2165 <ref> [16] </ref>. The architecture is divided into two parts. The first, which we call the front end, is the interaction between the client wishing to make the PSTN call and the server which will assist in discovering the right gateway.

Reference-contexts: In either case, the client unicasts a request for gateway service to the server. The client can obtain the address of the server in any of a number of ways. These include static configuration, through dynamic means such as DHCP <ref> [17] </ref>, or manually. Once received at the server, the request is processed. The server adds its own policy to the client request, and then accesses a database to find one or several gateways which satisfy the criteria. The results are then unicast back to the client.

RFC 1777, </type> <institution> Internet Engineering Task Force, </institution> <month> Mar. </month> <year> 1995. </year> <note> (Obsoletes RFC1487). 9 </note>
Reference-contexts: The protocol for the client-server interaction is based on the service location protocol (SLP) query protocol. This protocol provides a set of general filters which can be specified. It is similar in flavor to LDAP <ref> [18] </ref>, except that it is less complex. The main issue is then how the server builds up a database of gateways so that it can satisfy the query. To solve this problem, we rely on a scalable wide area multicast protocol.
