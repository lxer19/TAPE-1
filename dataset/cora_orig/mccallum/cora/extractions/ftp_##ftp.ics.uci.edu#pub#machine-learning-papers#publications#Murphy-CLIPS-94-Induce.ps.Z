Title: AUTOMATED RULE-BASE CREATION via CLIPS-INDUCE

Abstract: Many CLIPS rule-bases contain one or more rule groups that perform classification. In this paper we describe CLIPS-Induce, an automated system for the creation of a CLIPS classification rule-base from a set of test cases. CLIPS-Induce consists of two components, a decision tree induction component and a CLIPS production extraction component. ID3 [1], a popular decision tree induction algorithm, is used to induce a decision tree from the test cases. CLIPS production extraction is accomplished through a top-down traversal of the decision tree. Nodes of the tree are used to construct query rules, and branches of the tree are used to construct classification rules. The learned CLIPS productions may easily be incorporated into a large CLIPS system that perform tasks such as accessing a database or displaying information.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, a set of tests is evaluated to determine which test best partitions the set of cases down each branch. The metric used to evaluate the partition made by a particular test is know as information gain (for a more complete description of information gain and ID3, see <ref> [1] </ref>). Once a test is selected for a node, the cases are partitioned down each branch, and the algorithm is recursively called on the cases at the end of each branch.
