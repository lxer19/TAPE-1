Reference-contexts: One of the most significant dimensions for categorizing design tasks is the degree to which the design task can be recursively decomposed into separate subproblems, where each can be solved and the solution evaluated independently. If such decomposition is possible, we have what has been called a derivation problem <ref> [1] </ref>, and we can work in a systematic way from the specifications of the problem to its solution. Most work on AI in design (including our own [9]) has focused on tasks that can, to a first order approximation, be treated as decomposable into mostly independent subproblems. <p> Thus, when global constraints are important, there is no general way to reason from the specifications to the solution, and we have what has been called a formation problem <ref> [1] </ref>. The only obvious approach is to propose a complete candidate design, evaluate it, and, if it is not acceptable, modify it and try again.

Reference-contexts: seen as starting by identifying/characterizing an impasse in a given design, relative to desired specifications, and looking for ways of removing the impasse. 3 We believe it may be possible to automate this process of going from tradeoff to structural modification, perhaps using techniques like those of Sycara et al <ref> [2] </ref>, but we do not plan to work on this in the immediate future. 9 4.

Reference-contexts: FAD works by using (manually derived) methods for detecting places in a design where the approximate evaluators have misled the search in some abstraction space, and for inferring constraints that will correct this error. (See previous reports or <ref> [3] </ref> for details.) We have been testing FAD by using it to control the iteration in three existing systems: ASP, MACHINIST, and most recently BUD/DAA. ASP is a PROLOG based microprocessor synthesis system developed by our collaborator, Dr. Al Despain, from USC.

Reference-contexts: Designing a spoon, for instance, is quite different from designing a digital circuit. We believe that there are a number of dimensions along which design problems vary, and the appropriate techniques for a problem depend in systematic ways on where a problem falls along these dimensions <ref> [8, 4] </ref>. We can view these dimensions as inducing a space of design tasks.

Reference-contexts: A few pieces of work in AI and design have looked at problems with global constraints, e.g <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>, but these have looked at problems (e.g. designing a single gear pair), and where evaluating a design is a very cheap computation.
