Abstract: To support the diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of real-time (e.g. audio/video) applications in integrated services networks, several routing algorithms that allow for the reservation of the needed bandwidth over a Virtual Circuit (VC) established on one of several candidate routes have been proposed. Traditionally, such routing is done using the least-loaded concept, and thus results in balancing the load across the set of candidate routes. In a recent study, we have established the inadequacy of this load balancing practice and proposed the use of load profiling as an alternative. Load profiling techniques allow the distribution of "available" bandwidth across a set of candidate routes to match the characteristics of incoming VC QoS requests. In this paper we thoroughly characterize the performance of VC routing using load profiling and contrast it to routing using load balancing and load packing. We do so both analytically and via extensive simulations of multi-class traffic routing in Virtual Path (VP) based networks. Our findings confirm that for routing guaranteed bandwidth flows in VP networks, load balancing is not desirable as it results in VP bandwidth fragmentation, which adversely affects the likelihood of accepting new VC requests. This fragmentation is more pronounced when the granularity of VC requests is large. Typically, this occurs when a common VC is established to carry the aggregate traffic flow of many high-bandwidth real-time sources. For VP-based networks, our simulation results show that our load-profiling VC routing scheme performs better or as well as the traditional load-balancing VC routing in terms of revenue under both skewed and uniform workloads. Furthermore, load-profiling routing improves routing fairness by proactively increasing the chances of admitting high-bandwidth connections.

Reference-contexts: Both schemes are, however, based on pessimistic/deterministic analysis.

These traffic intensities may be known a priori (based on traffic forecasts) or dynamically estimated.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this scheme attempts to evenly distribute the load among the candidate routes. We call such scheme Least Loaded Routing (LLR). As an alternative to the load-balancing philosophy of LLR techniques, VC packing techniques were proposed in <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> Packing strategies achieve two desired properties: (1) They minimize the fragmentation of available bandwidth, resulting in an (2) improved fairness by increasing the chances of admittance for wideband VCs. A routing scheme based on this packing concept was proposed in <ref> [17] </ref>. The scheme attempts to pack class-s VCs in order to reduce blocking only for the next higher class of VCs. In [22], we extended the scheme in order to reduce blocking for all higher classes. Both schemes are, however, based on pessimistic/deterministic analysis. <p> This concept is often used to simplify network management and to increase the apparent direct connectedness of the network <ref> [8, 17, 30] </ref>.

We assume all VP links have the same total bandwidth. The network is used by a number of VC classes. <p> For simplicity, we will assume that all links have the same TR value. 14 Definition 1. An alternative route is said to be TR-permissible if its idle capacity minus the reservation threshold is greater than or equal to the requested bandwidth of the incoming VC <ref> [17] </ref>. Note that the idle capacity should then exceed a certain amount of bandwidth that varies depending on the class of the incoming VC. This further discourages higher VC classes (with higher bandwidth requirements) from using alternative routes. We thus refer to this as "class-dependent reservation".

Reference-contexts: Even if such reassignment is tolerable, achieving a perfect fit is known to be NP-hard. For these reasons, heuristics such as first-fit or best-fit are usually employed for on-line resource allocation. Asymptotically, both the first-fit and best-fit heuristics are known to be optimal for the on-line bin packing problem <ref> [23] </ref>. <p> According to our analytical characterization for equal class arrival rates (i.e. uniform request distribution) a 50% utilization would result in a 50% VC admission rate for LLR and in a 100% VC admission rate for a perfect packing heuristic. While MLR (i.e. best-fit packing) approximates perfect packing only asymptotically <ref> [23] </ref>, our results show that MLR's performance advantage is evident even at the small number of candidate paths we considered (namely 5 and 10). 7 * In terms of the distribution of VCs, LLR balances the load over the candidate paths. <p> Typically, this occurs when a common VC is established to carry the aggregate traffic flow of many high-bandwidth real-time sources. As an alternative to LLR, our simulations have shown that LPR's performance is competitive to the asymptotically optimal <ref> [23] </ref> most-loaded-based routing (MLR), while being much less susceptible to (more tolerant of) the inaccuracies in the feedback information inherent in a distributed network system because of its probabilistic selection of routes.

Reference-contexts: LPR performs especially well in a distributed network environment, where a router's local view of global knowledge is often imprecise. In such environments, LPR is particularly appropriate because of its probabilistic selection of routes, which compensates for inaccuracy in the feedback information <ref> [25] </ref>. This stands in sharp contrast to MLR, which is susceptible to even minor inaccuracies in knowledge about reserved bandwidth on various routes.

Reference-contexts: Over the last few years, several routing protocols based on the VC model have been proposed (e.g., <ref> [2, 27, 7] </ref>). We consider a network that supports S 2 classes of VCs. A VC of class s requires the reservation of a certain amount of bandwidth b s that is enough to ensure a given QoS.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case, a router may request a VC to another router to carry the packets of a particular class of applications over a backbone network that connects internet service providers and implements IP switching [26] or similar schemes such as tag switching [11], IP/ATM <ref> [28] </ref>, etc. Over the last few years, several routing protocols based on the VC model have been proposed (e.g., [2, 27, 7]). We consider a network that supports S 2 classes of VCs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Routing algorithms|allowing the selection of one out of many candidate source-to-destination paths for bandwidth reservation purposes|play a critical role in meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of real-time applications over high-speed integrated services networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks <ref> [29] </ref> and next generation Internet [6]. Routing Multi-Class Traffic under the VC Model To support real-time QoS we adopt the Virtual Circuit (VC) model for resource reservation.

Reference-contexts: This concept is often used to simplify network management and to increase the apparent direct connectedness of the network <ref> [8, 17, 30] </ref>. Typically, a VP is installed between two nodes (switches) over a sequence of physical links, and bandwidth is allocated to it. Thus a virtual fully-connected network can be overlayed over the physical network, where the VPs constitute the (virtual) links connecting the network nodes.

Reference-contexts: Routing with Trunk Reservation Optimal reservation thresholds have often been determined assuming a fixed (known) input traffic pattern (e.g. <ref> [31] </ref>). For simplicity, we assume all links have the same reservation threshold. We set the reservation threshold such that revenue is maximized. Figure 13 shows revenue versus reservation threshold for LLR under the skewed workload with = 11, where TR-permissibility is defined as given by Definition 1.

Reference-contexts: For a fully-connected network with N nodes, each pair of nodes has one direct route and N 2 two-link alternative routes. A number of such routing schemes were designed for telephone networks [13, 12, 3, 14] and recently for ATM networks <ref> [32, 17, 20, 21, 18, 19] </ref>. 3.1 Simulation Model and Setup We consider a fully-connected logical VP network, which could be carved out over an arbitrary underlying physical topology. We assume all VP links have the same total bandwidth. The network is used by a number of VC classes.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [33] </ref>, load balancing was found to reduce significantly the mean and standard deviation of job response times, especially under heavy or unbalanced workloads. For best-effort systems, reducing the mean and standard deviation of the metric used to gauge performance (e.g. job response times or throughput) is indicative of better performance.
