Abstract: An important problem in economics is finding the mathematical relationship between the empirically observed variables measuring a system. In many conventional modeling techniques, one necessarily begins by selecting the size and shape of the model. After making this choice, one usually then tries to find the values of certain coefficients required by the particular model so as to achieve the best fit between the observed data and the model. But, in many cases, the most important issue is the size and shape of the model itself. Finding the functional form of the model can be viewed as searching a space of possible computer programs for the particular computer program which produces the desired output for given inputs. This most fit computer program can be found via a recently developed genetic programming paradigm originally developed for solving artificial intelligence problems. This new genetic programming paradigm genetically breeds populations of computer programs in a Darwinian competition using genetic operations, such as crossover (sexual recombination). In this paper, we illustrate the process of discovering a model by rediscovering the well-known

Reference-contexts: John Holland of the University of Michigan presented the pioneering formulation of genetic algorithms for fixed-length character strings in Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems <ref> (Holland 1975) </ref>. Holland established, among other things, that the genetic algorithm is a mathematically near optimal approach to adaptation in that it maximizes expected overall average payoff when the adaptive process is viewed as a multi-armed slot machine problem requiring an optimal allocation of future trials given currently available information.

Reference-contexts: The structure of the individual mathematical objects that are manipulated by the genetic algorithm can be more complex than the fixed length character strings. For example, Holland's classifier system <ref> (Holland 1986) </ref> is a cognitive architecture into which the genetic algorithm is embedded so as to allow adaptive modification of a population of string-based if-then rules (whose condition and action parts are fixed length binary strings).

Reference-contexts: In the new genetic programming paradigm, populations of entire computer programs are genetically bred to solve problems. We have recently shown that entire computer programs can be genetically bred to solve problems in a variety of different areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and symbolic processing <ref> (Koza 1989, 1990a, 1991d) </ref>. In this recently developed genetic programming paradigm, the individuals in the population are compositions of functions and terminals appropriate to the particular problem domain. The set of functions used typically includes arithmetic operations, mathematical functions, conditional logical operations, and domainspecific functions.
