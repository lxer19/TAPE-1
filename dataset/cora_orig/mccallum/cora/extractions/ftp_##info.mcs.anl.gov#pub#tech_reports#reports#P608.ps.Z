Title: Tools for the Automatic Differentiation of Computer Programs  
Author: Christian Bischof and Andreas Griewank 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a methodology for developing sensitivity-enhanced versions of arbitrary computer programs. In this paper, we provide some background information on AD and basic implementation issues for the design of general purpose tools that can deal with codes from the Fortran and C family, address some frequently asked questions, and provide pointers for further study.
