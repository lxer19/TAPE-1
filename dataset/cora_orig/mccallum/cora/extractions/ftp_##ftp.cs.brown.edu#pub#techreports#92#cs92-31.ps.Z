Reference-contexts: From this result, the graphs used in Digital Topology, which represent the proximity between the pixels, are not induced by any topology. Some authors (Kovalevsky [10], Ankeney, Ritter <ref> [1] </ref>, Khalimsky [6]) consider either a special topology on the grid of the integer numbers or a combinatorial structure on the screen model. In some cases, these models have similar disadvantages as in the case that we have commented above.

Reference-contexts: But, in general, there is a basic structure for a wide range of problems. For example, the basic structure to the Plane Digital Topology is the one shown in the paragraphs above. But sometimes it is necessary to enlarge this structure. In <ref> [5] </ref> we enlarge the model E * , used in the Conceptual Level to prove the Digital Jordan Theorem, by another model E D in order to prove the Digital Schoenflies Theorem. <p> In [4] we present the mathematical structure which is used in the Logical and Conceptual Levels. And in <ref> [5] </ref> we present the basic properties of our architecture in order to develop the Plane Digital Topology. Acknowledgements. We would like to thank Julio Rubio for his very useful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

Reference-contexts: So it is natural to abstract the screen model as a graph whose vertices corresponding to the pixels and the edges represent the adjacency between the pixels. This is the most extended point of view (Rosenfeld [13], [14], [15], Kong, Roscoe <ref> [7] </ref>). But the problem is that this kind of models are far from the Euclidean plane (or space). So, from this point of view, it is needed to develop the Digital Topology without using the well-known results of Euclidean Topology.

Reference-contexts: Digital Topology plays a very important role in computer vision, image processing and computer graphics. But a complete theoretical foundation of a consistent theory for digital spaces is still missing. Kong and Rosenfeld give in <ref> [8] </ref> a very good survey about this subject. A digital image is an object in the computer screen where the smallest elements are pixels or, more abstractly, compact topological cells such that they only have intersection in their borders.

This is the most extended point of view (Rosenfeld <ref> [13] </ref>, [14], [15], Kong, Roscoe [7]). But the problem is that this kind of models are far from the Euclidean plane (or space). So, from this point of view, it is needed to develop the Digital Topology without using the well-known results of Euclidean Topology. <p> In it the curve becomes the subgraph induced by the vertices corresponding to black pixels. Because E 8 is not planar, it is well-known that we can not represent in it the topology of the Euclidean plane (see Rosenfeld <ref> [13] </ref>). To solve that problem we flatten out this graph 6 in a natural way and we get the planar graph E * represented in the Figure 4.a. In this graph there are two different kinds of vertices.
