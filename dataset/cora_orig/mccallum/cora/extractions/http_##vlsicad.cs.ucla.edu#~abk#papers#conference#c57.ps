Abstract: each run consists of 1000 passes of FM. LSMC outperforms the previous best reported results in the literature by 6.4% for unit area and averages 21.4% improvement over FMx50. With actual module areas, LSMC is 1% better than previous results, and averages 36% improvement over FMx50. We have presented an experimental study of several local perturbation strategies (kick moves) for the Large-Step Markov Chain (LSMC) heuristic applied to VLSI netlist bisection. Our experimental results show that the LSMC heuristic consistently outperforms the standard random multistart strategy, given the same computational resources. The quality of our results compare favorably to existing published results. We are currently pursuing the following extensions to our work: * [9] showed that for the TSP, the efficacy of the kick moves depends on the underlying greedy descent engine. This may be the case for netlist partitioning as well. We are currently studying whether implementation details such as lookahead [11] or the gain bucket tie-breaking scheme used [6] will significantly affect the choice of kick move. * Problem reduction techniques can significantly improve the performance of iterative improvement partitioning algorithms [7]. In such hierarchical approaches, it is possible to use LSMC in place of the standard FM algorithm to improve solution quality, at the cost of additional runtime. For example, in a 2-phase FM approach [3], the calls to the FM algorithm can be replaced with calls to LSMC. We are currently experimenting with this approach; preliminary experiments show that this is quite promising. * The LSMC heuristic can be straightforwardly generalized to k-way partitioning (each of the kick moves described in Section 2 has an obvious k-way generalization). In preliminary experiments, k-way LSMC with clustering kick move is promising, yielding better results than equivalent computational efforts with a multistart k-way FM. * Finally, [9] has shown that more elaborate variants of LSMC, e.g., using non-zero temperature schedules and population-based optimization can be effective on the TSP. Similar improvements may be found for netlist partitioning. . [1] C.J. Alpert and A.B. Kahng, "Geometric Embeddings for Faster and Better Multi-Way Netlist Partitioning", in Proc.
