Abstract: Spatial coherence is a very important topic in image Synthesis, particularly in the popular ray-tracing algorithm and all its expensive intersection computations, or the radiosity light modeling which involves huge visibility calculations to determine the form factors. Motion planning where objects are seen as obstacles to straight line trajectories deals too with visibility problems. In order to solve them, a data structure called the visibility graph has been widely used. In polygonal scene it links the vertices that can see each other, in a scene of convex objects, it is made of the bitangents which don't intersect any object (see [GM91], [OW88]). But its discrete structure does not allow taking efficiently into account the coherence between the intersections of two "very near" lines, typically like for the computation of a view from a point (visibility polygon). That's why the visibility complex of a set of a set of n pairwise disjoint convex objects in the plane was introduced by [PV93]. Working in a dual space that transforms lines into points allows to group the lines sharing the same visibility in faces, and the main computational structure is now the complex, instead of the scene as before with the graph. The aim of the video is to give a better understanding of various notions involved in the definition and use of the visibility complex. It starts with basic considerations on the duality in the plane, and shows visually the correspondance between the real and the dual space. Then it introduces the dual arrangement of a set of convex objects. It gives a graphical idea of what the visibility complex is by first using lines with origins, which then helps to introduce the notion of maximal free segments which are used for the visibility complex. We insist on the structure of a typical face of the complex. Then a sweeping algorithm that can build the complex in O(mlog(n)) where n is the size of the visibility graph is shown quickly. The video illustrates also the use of the complex to compute the view "around" a point. It consists in going through the complex along the curve defined by the set of segments originated at this point, which is a sine curve in the dual Time coherence is also taken into account, since when an object is moved, the modifications of the complex takes only place along its curve of tangency, and the topology of the complex is modified only when a line becomes tangent to three objects. This is shown in the video.
