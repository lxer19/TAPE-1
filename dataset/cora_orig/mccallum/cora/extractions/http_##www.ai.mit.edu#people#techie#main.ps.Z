Reference-contexts: We believe that a system redesign will yield much more interesting results. CAD tool deficiencies in the area of modeling OEIC designs were flagged as the downfall in the first design. The standard AT&T VLSI design tool package, MULGA, <ref> [ACW87] </ref> uses symbolic mask editing for custom layouts, and cannot easily adapt to handle photodetector devices nor parasitic extraction of such geometries, nor the creation of accurate models for simulation. <p> photodiode designs presented in Chapter 3, minimum wire widths were used throughout because the photocurrents are so small that they will not cause significant voltage drops to appear across interconnect wiring. 4.3 MULGA: AT&T's VLSI CAD tool set MULGA is AT&T's integrated MOS VLSI symbolic design and analysis tool set <ref> [ACW87] </ref>. It uses a symbolic intermediate circuit description language, icdl, which relieves the designer from having to know the process design rules. Icdl uses a virtual grid for design viewing, and it understands the following objects: devices (transistors), wires, pins (labels), and contacts.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 1.1 Overview The Digital Optics Group at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey has been investigating low-cost, massively parallel monolithic optoelectronic interconnect microsystems, specifically developing Optical Data Link (ODL) ICs, using an in-house Si CMOS VLSI process technology <ref> [AD88, DPC + 89] </ref>. Previous systems achieved very low communication rates (under 10 Mb/s per channel) | an order of magnitude slower than expected through simulation results |, and the cause for the low throughput has yet to be explored.

Reference-contexts: In the 200 to 1100 nm regime | which includes the visible spectrum | silicon is most sensitive, making it the most popular choice for optical sensor material. Also, many vendors offer competitive silicon detector solutions in high-speed packaging styles <ref> [Ham90, Sie90, Tex90, Adv90, Mot88, Opt90] </ref>. 35 3.2 Photosensor Types The three main categories of photosensors are depicted top-to-bottom in Figure 3-1. The various photodiode and phototransistor types all operate on the same basic principle. <p> Moreover, the intrinsic region thickness can be tailored to optimize responsivity and response time. Typical PIN photodiodes have been fabricated to have quantum efficiencies at or near 100 percent <ref> [Ham90, Adv90] </ref>. The capacitance of a PIN photodiode is lowered significantly because the effective "plates" of the capacitor have been spread apart by the length of the I region. The avalanche photodiode requires a huge 6 reverse-bias voltage to create the high electric field required for avalanche multiplication.

Reference-contexts: Not only are lateral dimensions reduced, but also many vertical distances, such as diffusion depths shrink as well. The reduction in many dimensions requires a corresponding reduction in the voltages used, assuming a constant E -field scaling constraint is imposed <ref> [All88] </ref>. In order for depletion widths of transistor channels to decrease proportionately, the doping in the bulk near the source/drain junctions must increase by the same factor. The CMOS process-compliant PN diode designs all rely upon the scaled doping densities, and hence, all diode depletion widths will decrease as well. <p> In order to facilitate a fast turn-around time of optoelectronic designs, standard design tools must be developed. Designs concerns could then shift from managing complexity toward improving costs and more developed testing procedures. A similar trend has occurred in traditional VLSI design tools in the past decade <ref> [All88] </ref>. The motivation for writing new CAD tools will be discussed in the context of AT&T's MULGA 1 VLSI design system.

Reference-contexts: An evaluation of these same types of photodiodes, except for a P-well process, can be found in the literature <ref> [AOV88] </ref>. Their findings are reported in Table 3.1 for a 4-m P-well technology. I rev is the reverse-bias photocurrent, and C J is the diode depletion capacitance. <p> For the AT&T process, the N+N/P diode type was chosen as the primary style to be implemented in the photogen program of Chapter 4 actually before outside work <ref> [AOV88] </ref> was known.

Reference-contexts: However, in the area of interconnections, where the communication distances are much less than long-haul, but sometimes not much more than on-chip distances, one must make careful selection of the medium of communication by being fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of using each technique <ref> [Cau90] </ref>. Electrical layering, thin film wiring, and bump bonding techniques have improved electrical interconnects, but often off-chip drivers must be slowed down in order to accommodate slow off-chip links. <p> Current electrical interconnect systems operate at rates up to several gigabits per second, whereas optical systems can easily operate in the terahertz range [CO90]. Moreover, the fastest electrical pulses are produced with light <ref> [Cau90] </ref>. Typically, the bandwidth available on an optical link is not limited by the link itself, but rather by the speed of the electronics. One approach to exploiting the available bandwidth on an optical link is to time-multiplex electrical signals. Another is to use wavelength-division multiplexing. <p> Bonding 10 5 connections is unwieldy for electronics, and is no concern for optics, however, mechanical alignment of the optical beams may be difficult. Some of the direct consequences of the mutability of optical interconnections include the following <ref> [Cau90] </ref>: * connections between removable objects * connections between remote objects * large number of connections * "smart" or selective connections: with the merger of optics and complex electronic logic, connections can adapt to meet system signal-to-noise requirements, to take advantage of redundant hardware for fault-tolerance, to monitor and output vital

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the tool developed will be designed for process-independence so that the standard MOSIS shuttle service may be used to lower costs. 1.2 The Need for Optical Interconnect Systems Many researchers are investigating different aspects of optoelectronic interconnection systems for use in high-speed computing. <ref> [LHH + 90, Hut86, Kim91, Wil91, CO90, KHK90, Ols93] </ref>. The ultimate speed of such systems is becoming limited not so much by processor speed, but rather by the speed of its inter-processor interconnects [CO90]. <p> The ultimate speed of such systems is becoming limited not so much by processor speed, but rather by the speed of its inter-processor interconnects <ref> [CO90] </ref>. The reason is simple: electronic integrated circuit line widths continue to decrease, and gate densities are increasing with low power techniques being exploited to achieve more computations with a given amount of power. <p> Interconnect technology development needs to improve at the same or better rate; however, it has become exceedingly difficult for electronics alone to meet the needs, and some sort of technology breakthrough is needed. <ref> [CO90] </ref>. The need for higher speeds, lower power dissipation, and greater packaging densities is the impetus for considering optics in an area where electronics currently dominates. <p> Thus, electrical interconnect wiring densities are not limited by current lithography, but are rather constrained by noise considerations [Rub90a]. Current electrical interconnect systems operate at rates up to several gigabits per second, whereas optical systems can easily operate in the terahertz range <ref> [CO90] </ref>. Moreover, the fastest electrical pulses are produced with light [Cau90]. Typically, the bandwidth available on an optical link is not limited by the link itself, but rather by the speed of the electronics. One approach to exploiting the available bandwidth on an optical link is to time-multiplex electrical signals. <p> reason behind this phenomena is due to the intrinsic responsivity of Si, which is explained in more depth in Chapter 3. 5 For instance, GaAs liftoff of lasers and flip-chip bonding techniques can be employed. 23 as a function of frequency for various types of optical and electrical transmission mediums <ref> [CO90] </ref>. 2.5 Fanin and Fanout Limitations The fanin and fanout of optical signals is huge because optical signals require very little power and can cross without interference, unlike their electrical counterparts. <p> Fiber-optic links, however, require more careful impedance matching so that reflected optical energy will not feed back into the source laser and degrade its performance <ref> [CO90] </ref>. Electrical interconnects are limited by the fact that they must drive inherently low-impedance transmission lines | typically around 50 . The low impedance drivers required for such a transmission line consume considerable chip area and power. <p> Photodiodes with over 80 percent quantum efficiency are also manufacturable. Electrical drivers, on the other hand, require about 10-20mA switching current which is an order of magnitude higher than their optical counterparts <ref> [CO90] </ref>. Communication energy is actually only less for optics than for electronics when the distances for communication are greater than some critical length.

Reference-contexts: Si optical links can replace a single ultra high-speed link, in order to reduce costs yet maintain all the other benefits of optics. 2.4 Attenuation Factors For high frequencies (in and above the GHz range), electrical interconnect bandwidth is limited by the resistance, skin effect, and dielectric dispersion of wires <ref> [DKR + 90] </ref>. The frequency-dependent dispersion of optical signals is much less than that of electrical signals over the range of distances used in interconnections because optics does not rely upon conduction. Absorption, scattering and misdirected light comprise the main loss factors in an integrated optical system. <p> If the gates were connected optically, however, then the irregular connections: some hybrid combination may be needed to produce low area and efficient logic utilization. 11 Cu deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be used to increase resistance to electro-migration and increase conductivity over traditional Al wiring <ref> [Shr90, DKR + 90] </ref>. 12 Threshold current also increases with laser temperature. 29 setup would work.

Reference-contexts: Free-space or planar imaging techniques using microlens arrays or holograms <ref> [Jah90, Fel90] </ref> can be employed to broadcast an individual optical signal to many destinations with low interarrival skews due to matched transmission distances and the low noise properties of optical propagation.

Reference-contexts: For a direct band gap material like GaAs, there is no constraint on the electron-hole creation process and the absorption coefficient increases rapidly for wavelengths less than the critical absorption wavelength <ref> [Gow84] </ref>. <p> The transit-time limited frequency response of a PIN diode assuming high-frequency operation, low light penetration depth, and generation of carriers all one end of the depletion layer has been shown <ref> [Lin89, Gow84] </ref> to be I (f ) = f t tr For the case where t tr = 0:2 ns, the 3 dB down-point in output power occurs when f 2:21 GHz.

The avalanche photodiode requires a huge 6 reverse-bias voltage to create the high electric field required for avalanche multiplication. <p> circuit, its total capacitance adds to the front-end (receiver) capacitance which can significantly impact receiver sensitivity. 3.3.4 Crosstalk (for arrays) Crosstalk between adjacent detector array elements is defined as the ratio of the pho-tocurrent generated in a dark detector to the photocurrent generated in an adjacent, 60-80 percent illuminated detector <ref> [Ham90] </ref>. The intensity of illumination is adjusted to achieve a specified output current in the illuminated detector. <p> generated photocurrent 24 by the square-root of the doping concentration 25 R sh is also commonly termed, source impedance, R so 26 some photodiode manufacturers specify the shunt resistance to be the slope of the dark current with respect to the applied voltage when the reverse-bias voltage is around 10mV <ref> [Ham90] </ref>. 61 a standard AT&T CMOS technology (0.9 m silicon gate length) are illustrated in internal interference patterns which degrade overall responsivity of the diode. Optical response can be enhanced by removing the protective nitride over photodiode surfaces and adjusting the oxide thickness.

Reference-contexts: For these two reasons, orders of magnitude more signals can be carried in optical form in a given volume than can be carried electrically <ref> [Hua91] </ref>. 2.3 Available Bandwidth Optics has a much higher available bandwidth than electronics primarily because optical wavelengths are much shorter than the free-space wavelengths associated with typical electrical circuits. <p> Fault-tolerance through optical interconnections and redundant electronics is easy to implement because of the unidirectional nature of free-space optical interconnections versus the bidirectional character of electrical wires <ref> [Hua91] </ref>. 2.12 Communication Energy Electrical interconnections can be modeled in two distinct manners [Kim91]: for short distances, a lumped RC model will suffice; for longer distances, a distributed transmission line model should be used. <p> Communication energy is actually only less for optics than for electronics when the distances for communication are greater than some critical length. Figure 2-8 based on Huang and Miller <ref> [Hua91, Mil90] </ref> depicts the critical communication distance where optics is more energy efficient than electronics for the same BER, ignoring cost 32 concerns.

Another is to use wavelength-division multiplexing. Figure 2-1 shows how time-division multiplexing can be used in optical interconnects <ref> [Hut86] </ref>. This method works well as long as the multiplexors can be built from low-cost components which also handle the bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2-2 shows such a configuration for 40 optical channels. Jurgen successfully demonstrated 1024 such optical channels using planar microlens arrays <ref> [Jah90] </ref>. In Figure 2-2, a separate laser array is used to transmit optical signals to an optoelectronic receiver chip. The microlens arrays are used to correct beam divergence for this free-space configuration. <p> Free-space or planar imaging techniques using microlens arrays or holograms <ref> [Jah90, Fel90] </ref> can be employed to broadcast an individual optical signal to many destinations with low interarrival skews due to matched transmission distances and the low noise properties of optical propagation. <p> Figure 2-5 depicts a monolithic optical approach to synchronous clock distribution in a digital system. In such a configuration, redundancy of emitters and receivers can increase reliability and reduce mechanical alignment problems. Another example of integrated optics comes from the work of Jahns <ref> [Jah90] </ref>. Figure 2-4 depicts an integrated optical imaging arrangement with 2-D microlens arrays. 2.7 Switching Noise Another effect which can degrade the performance of electrical interconnect systems is noise caused by high-frequency switching transients.

Reference-contexts: If an external voltage is applied across the device, the measured current will be proportional to the light intensity. In a real device, there are many processes that can degrade performance. Carrier trapping, recombination, and thermal generation of carriers can cause non-linearities <ref> [LHA + 93] </ref>. <p> For mathematical derivations of the parameters discussed below, please refer to Appendix A. A useful table containing important device design parameters may be found in Appendix B. 3.3.1 Active Area Two different photodetector diffusion types <ref> [LHA + 93] </ref> are shown in Figure 3-5. For the mesa type, the PN junction emerges on the sides of the device, so it is difficult to passivate this junction area with oxide. Therefore, it is often exposed and vulnerable to contamination and atmospheric degradation. <p> The N EP and Dfl parameters are useful figures of merit for photodiode sensitivity. However, in actual applications, the receiver amplifier design usually contributes much more total noise to the system, so the responsivity parameter of a photodiode is often a better indicator of performance <ref> [LHA + 93] </ref>. 3.3.8 Quantum Efficiency The quantum efficiency of a photodetector is defined to be the fraction of incident photons which are absorbed and eventually become current-producing carriers. <p> This feature gives the PIN diode better immunity to reverse breakdown. 117 Figure A-8: PIN Diode Characteristic Distributions 118 Appendix B Important Photodiode Parameters Table B.1 was developed from discussions in Chapter 3 and with the aid of the Photonics Handbook <ref> [LHA + 93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The dark-current component of shot noise is the major source of noise for the diode in sub-GHz operation <ref> [Lin89] </ref>. It has four contributing factors: trap-related thermally-generated carriers in the depletion region, diffusion current, tunneling, and surface leakage. Thermally generated minority carriers in the non-intrinsic region outside the depletion region can diffuse into the depletion region and contribute a diffusion current component to the dark current. <p> In thermal equilibrium these processes would balance out, but in the high-field depletion region, the emitted carriers are swept away by the electric field before they can be recaptured by traps. This component of the current can be modeled <ref> [Lin89] </ref> as 48 I gd = t e e ( qV where W is the depletion width and t e is the effective minority carrier lifetime. <p> This diffusion current component contributes a slow "tail" to the diode's response due to excess absorption outside the depletion region. Since the minority carrier lifetimes can easily be over 10 ns, in most materials <ref> [Lin89] </ref>, to minimize the rise and fall times, it is important to generate as many of the carriers as possible in the high-field, depleted region of the diode where the carrier velocities are fast, and to minimize the number of slow carriers generated outside this region. <p> The transit-time limited frequency response of a PIN diode assuming high-frequency operation, low light penetration depth, and generation of carriers all one end of the depletion layer has been shown <ref> [Lin89, Gow84] </ref> to be I (f ) = f t tr For the case where t tr = 0:2 ns, the 3 dB down-point in output power occurs when f 2:21 GHz.

Reference-contexts: In other words, an optoelectronic interconnect is a special type of optical isolator. It functions as an ideal transformer, isolating two separate voltages in circuits and performing well even down to DC frequencies <ref> [Mil90] </ref>. In this manner, it can handle arbitrarily long strings of "one" or "zero" in a non-return to zero (NRZ) digital system, though most systems require some means of coding to facilitate clock recovery on the receiver end. <p> Moreover, free-space optical interconnects do not experience back-loading effects, and are, thus, limited only by the available power and detector area that must be covered. In fact, thousands of interconnections can be easily accommodated with a single lens <ref> [Mil90] </ref>. These combined facts encourage using optical interconnections to solve many problems with high speed clock distribution. Figure 2-5 depicts a monolithic optical approach to synchronous clock distribution in a digital system. In such a configuration, redundancy of emitters and receivers can increase reliability and reduce mechanical alignment problems. <p> Communication energy is actually only less for optics than for electronics when the distances for communication are greater than some critical length. Figure 2-8 based on Huang and Miller <ref> [Hua91, Mil90] </ref> depicts the critical communication distance where optics is more energy efficient than electronics for the same BER, ignoring cost 32 concerns. <p> The critical distance of 200 m shown would be closer to about 200 cm if today's costs are taken into account, however, with optics prices dropping (especially due to integration) and optical efficiencies increasing rapidly, this critical dimension will continue to decrease <ref> [Mil90] </ref>. Notice that for communication distances beyond 4 cm (4000 m), the electronics energy curve remains constant.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the tool developed will be designed for process-independence so that the standard MOSIS shuttle service may be used to lower costs. 1.2 The Need for Optical Interconnect Systems Many researchers are investigating different aspects of optoelectronic interconnection systems for use in high-speed computing. <ref> [LHH + 90, Hut86, Kim91, Wil91, CO90, KHK90, Ols93] </ref>. The ultimate speed of such systems is becoming limited not so much by processor speed, but rather by the speed of its inter-processor interconnects [CO90]. <p> The approximation holds true for random failures (which as a result of being a Poisson process, have exponential first-order interarrival times), not those due to component wear out (which have a log-normal distribution) <ref> [Ols93] </ref>. For example, a system composed of 1000 lasers each having a random failure time of 10 5 hours will have a mean time between failure (MTBF) of about 100 hours. Wear out failures will only increase this rate. Many aspects of electrical connections can lead to system reliability problems. <p> of monolithic lasers used in optical interconnections follows the traditional "bathtub" curve, where in the early stages of use, the rate of laser attrition due to component failures is high, then the rate decreases for quite some time, and finally, the laser extinction rate increases again due to wear out <ref> [Ols93] </ref>. The wear out of a semiconductor laser results in an increased threshold current, 12 making driver feedback circuits necessary in order to adjust the laser bias current to achieve a constant BER over time (before final failure).

Reference-contexts: Thus, electrical interconnect wiring densities are not limited by current lithography, but are rather constrained by noise considerations <ref> [Rub90a] </ref>. Current electrical interconnect systems operate at rates up to several gigabits per second, whereas optical systems can easily operate in the terahertz range [CO90]. Moreover, the fastest electrical pulses are produced with light [Cau90]. <p> In typical low-noise electrical systems, the last three recommendations are usually employed. 2.8 Crosstalk Noise Electrical signals are also degraded by interference due to stray capacitances and mutual inductances that exist between nearby transmission lines.
