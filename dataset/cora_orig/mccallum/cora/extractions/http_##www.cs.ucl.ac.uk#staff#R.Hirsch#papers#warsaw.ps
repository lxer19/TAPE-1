Abstract: We investigate the class SRaCA n for 4 n &lt; ! and survey some recent results. We see that RA n | the subalgebras of relation algebras with relational bases | is too weak, and that the class of relation algebras whose canonical extension has an n-dimensional cylindric basis is too strong to define the class. We introduce the notion of an n-dimensional hyperbasis and show that for any relation algebra A the canonical extension A + has such a hyperbasis if and only if A 2 SRaCA n . We introduce techniques that can be used to show that the hierarchies RA 4 oe RA 5 oe : : : and SRaCA 4 oe SRaCA 5 oe : : : are strict and each step is not finitely axiomatisable. We outline a relativized semantics that characterises RA n and another one for the class of This abstract summarises our investigations into the connections between relation algebras and cylindric algebras. Necessarily the detailed proofs have been omitted. Fuller accounts of some of the material can be found in [HH98c, HHM98, HH98a, HH98b] though some of the work is still in progress. Algebraic logic is about relations considered algebraically. The simplest algebraic logic, boolean algebra, can be thought of as the algebra of unary relations. The correspondence between boolean algebras and fields of unary relations (or just fields of sets) is precise: every field of sets is a boolean algebra and every boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets [Sto36]. There are a number of algebras that are intended to correspond to relations of higher ranks, though the correspondence is less accurate. For binary relations, the most important kind of algebra is a relation algebra, based on the work of De Morgan, Peirce and Schroder and formalised by Tarski. But not every relation algebra is isomorphic to a field of binary relations (not every relation algebra is representable) and it requires infinitely many axioms to characterise the isomorphism class of the representable relation algebras [Lyn50, Mon64]. For higher-order relations there are alternative algebraizations: cylindric algebra, diagonal-free cylindric algebra, polyadic algebra and so on. The one which has received most attention is cylindric algebra. As with binary relations, not every n-dimensional cylindric algebra is representable as an n-dimensional generalised cylindric set algebra (which is a generalisation of a field of n-ary relations) and it requires infinitely many axioms to characterise this representation class. There is a well-known technique for obtaining a relation algebra Ra(C) from an n-dimensional cylindric algebra C. Ra(C) is constructed by taking the two-dimensional elements of C (i.e. the elements a 2 C such that c i a = a for 2 i &lt; n) and using the spare dimensions to define converse and composition [HMT85, 5.3.7]. Ra(C) is called the relation algebra reduct of C. The fact that n 4 is enough to ensure that Ra(C) is associative and hence a relation algebra [HMT85, 5.3.8]. For m &lt; n there is a similar (and rather easier) method of constructing an m-dimensional cylindric algebra Nr m (C) from an n-dimensional one C. The focus of this paper is to investigate the connections between cylindric algebras of dimension n 4 and relation algebras. In particular we will address the question: for which relation algebras subalgebras of relation algebras with n-dimensional cylindric bases.

Reference-contexts: A corollary of this is that there is no finite axiom schema that can be added to ` n to make it equal in power to ` n+1 . A different algebraic construction was used in <ref> [HH98c] </ref> to show that RA n+1 is not finitely axiomatisable over RA n (4 n &lt; !). Representation Theory Theorem 6 tells us that for any relation algebra A we have A 2 SRaCA n iff A + has an n-dimensional hyperbasis. <p> We can axiomatise the classes RA n ; SCB n in the same way.

Reference-contexts: SRaCA n 6= SRaCA n+1 for 3 n &lt; !. For this, we define a finite relation algebra 3 A n and show that A n 2 SRaCA n n SRaCA n+1 . An alternative construction is in <ref> [HHM98] </ref>. The atoms of A n are 1 0 and a r (p) : p &lt; n 1; r &lt; m 0 where m 0 is some large integer, say m 0 = n n . All atoms are self-converse. <p> Maddux points out that this solves [HMT71, problem 2.12] negatively: SNr n CA n+i 6= SNr n CA n+i+1 for 2 &lt; n &lt; !; i &lt; !. A corollary (see <ref> [HHM98] </ref>) is that a certain n + 1-variable proof system ` n+1 defined in [TG87] using only one binary predicate symbol is strictly stronger than its n-variable counterpart ` n .
