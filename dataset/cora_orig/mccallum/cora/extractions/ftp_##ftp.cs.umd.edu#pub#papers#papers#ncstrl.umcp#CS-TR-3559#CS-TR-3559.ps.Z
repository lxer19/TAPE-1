Title: PERTURBATION OF EIGENVALUES OF PRECONDITIONED NAVIER-STOKES OPERATORS

Abstract: We study the sensitivity of algebraic eigenvalue problems associated with matrices arising from linearization and discretization of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, for several choices of preconditioners applied to the system of discrete equations, we derive upper bounds on perturbations of eigenvalues as functions of the viscosity and discretization mesh size. The bounds suggest that the sensitivity of the eigenvalues is at worst linear in the inverse of the viscosity and quadratic in the inverse of the mesh size, and that scaling can be used to decrease the sensitivity in some cases. Experimental results supplement these results and confirm the relatively mild dependence on viscosity. They also indicate a dependence on the mesh size of magnitude smaller than the analysis suggests. fl Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, e-mail: elman@cs.umd.edu.

An alternative that was considered in <ref> [3] </ref> is to approximate the action of F 1 (i.e., compute an approximate solution to systems with coefficient matrix F ) using an inner iteration. Unless very stringent stopping criteria are used here, the resulting preconditioned operators can be viewed as perturbations of those of (6) - (7). <p> The submatrices on the right of (8) - (9) are G = BF 1 ; K T = B T Q 1 ; H = GK T = BF 1 B T Q 1 : The identity matrices are of order n u . We recall some results from <ref> [3] </ref>, which give bounds on the eigenvalues of H . Let S = BF 1 B T denote the Schur complement matrix for (3), and let C = B F 1 + F T ! 2 B T ; denote the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of S, respectively. <p> Let S = BF 1 B T denote the Schur complement matrix for (3), and let C = B F 1 + F T ! 2 B T ; denote the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of S, respectively.

All computations were performed in MATLAB on either a Sun SPARC-20 workstation or a DEC-Alpha 2100 4/275 workstation. We first show in Figure 1 some sample distributions of eigenvalues of A T and A D , for = 1=20 and n = 32. <p> Consider the implication of these observations on the performance of iterative methods for solving the discrete Oseen equations (3). We demonstrated in <ref> [3] </ref> that the iteration counts of Krylov subspace methods such as GMRES with the preconditioner Q T (7) are independent of the mesh size, but that there is some deterioration in performance as decreases.

Once again, this stands in contrast with analytic bounds such as those obtainable from the Bauer-Fike theorem <ref> [7, p. 342] </ref>, which suggests perturbations proportional to (P ). 7. Inexact inner iteration. We conclude by examining the effect of inexact computation of the action of F 1 .

Reference-contexts: In the sequel, we will not distinguish among such possibilities for M. 2 underlying problem, specifically, the viscosity and mesh size h. In this paper, we examine these dependencies using a combination of analytic and experimental results. The analysis derives from Wilkinson's classical perturbation analysis <ref> [18] </ref>, which shows that if there are no nonlinear elementary divisors, the perturbations are of magnitude O (*). The analytic bounds are stated as functions of and h but they also depend on properties of certain matrices associated with the Schur complement BF 1 B T derived from (4). <p> form for A T with V T = I 0 !

Assertion (26) follows. The argument for (27) is identical, applied to the second block row of (25). Thus, we can restrict our attention to the block diagonal entries of ^ E T . <p> Note that for any 2 oe (A T ) with nonlinear elementary divisors, bounds analogous to (29)-(30) and (34)-(35) can be obtained in which the dependence on * is of the form * 1=r where r is the order of the largest Jordan block for ; see <ref> [18, p. 79] </ref>. 4. Analytic bounds for the block diagonal preconditioner. For the block diagonal preconditioner, we have results only in the case where the Schur complement matrix H has no nonlinear elementary divisors.
