Title: On a Covering Property of Maximal Sperner Families*  
Author: Peter L. Erd-os and Niall Graham 
Abstract: AMS Subject Classifications (1991): 05 D 05, 06 A 07 Key words: Sperner family, ranked poset, monotone Boolean function ABSTRACT: In the lattice of subsets of an n-set X, every maximal Sperner family S may be partitioned into disjoint subfamilies A and B, such that the union of the upset of A with the downset of B yields the entire lattice: U (A) [ D(B) = 2 X . The result generalizes to certain posets.

Reference-contexts: Ranked Posets Theorem 1 can be generalized to certain partially ordered sets. In this section we discuss such a possible generalization. The definitions not given here can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. Let P = (P; &lt; p ) be a finite poset. We say, that P is dense if every non-empty open interval fx; yg = fz 2 P : x &lt; p z &lt; p yg) contains at least two elements. <p> Examples and Conjecture In this section we furnish some posets which satisfy property (3) and some which do not. Example 1. Every finite geometric lattice satisfies (3). Indeed, a geometric lattice is ranked, and since it is relatively complemented, is dense as well (see <ref> [1] </ref>, Section II.3). Upon application of Theorem 2, the result follows. We remark that the notion of `denseness' is not essential. The following lattice is neither dense, nor ranked, yet satisfies (3).

Reference-contexts: Upon application of Theorem 2, the result follows. We remark that the notion of `denseness' is not essential. The following lattice is neither dense, nor ranked, yet satisfies (3). The symbol &lt; means `covers' in the poset: Example 2. (Faigle, <ref> [2] </ref>) The lattice fa &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt; e; a &lt; f &lt; d; b &lt; g &lt; eg satisfies (3). On the other hand, there are distributive lattices which do not satisfy (3).
