Reference-contexts: The drawback of computing K 1 d using this similarity transformation is the large computational cost incurred (O (N 3 ), where N is the number of nodal variables), which can be avoided by using the property that differential operators in wavelet basis remain sparse (see <ref> [1] </ref>) and have strong diagonal dominance (see [30]).

The reference shape s is given by, s = B ( ~ s) (2) Where B is a bending deformation, a function of two parameters: the radius of curvature k and angle of the bending plane ff (see [2] for details). <p> in Bajscy et al., <ref> [2] </ref>), due to it's attractive global shape characterization.

However, these algorithms do not describe techniques to constrain fractals.

Reference-contexts: Shape reconstruction from sensed data requires a broad geometric coverage. The models must recover detailed structure from noisy data using only the weakest of the possible assumptions about the observed shapes. Generalized spline models with continuity constraints are well suited for fulfilling the goals of shape reconstruction <ref> [38, 43, 8] </ref>. Generalized splines are the key ingredient of the dynamic shape modeling paradigm introduced by Terzopoulos et. al., [40, 41]. Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling with generalized splines, allows for creating realistic animation for computer graphics applications and also for tracking moving objects in computer vision applications.

Also, the modal deformations are assumed to be the free vibration modes of the object which simplifies the simulation of the dynamics of the object. <p> Also, the modal deformations are assumed to be the free vibration modes of the object which simplifies the simulation of the dynamics of the object.

Note that the wavelet-based pyramid is used in their work only for the data compression purposes.

Reference-contexts: This ordinary differential equation can be solved numerically. In figure 2, a superquadric with its natural nonuniform tessalation is shown side by side to the same superquadric uniformly tessalated using the method described above. Very fast retessalation of the superquadric can be achieved using the Runge-Kutta method <ref> [15] </ref>. Specifically, we use an order three Runge-Kutta method. The retessalation needs to be done whenever the parameters of the superquadric are subject to large (greater than a preselected threshold) changes.

Reference-contexts: In addition, there is no smooth transition in the number of parameters that can capture descriptions of the range of generated shapes. In this paper we introduce a new multi-resolution hybrid modeling scheme [47] that uses an orthonormal wavelet basis <ref> [23, 16] </ref>. Our hybrid models have the unique property of being able to smoothly scale up or down the range (from local to global) of possible deformations and the number of parameters required to characterize them. These properties are inherited by virtue of the multiresolution wavelet representation.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, in surface modeling applications we rarely if ever have this kind of complete knowledge about the probabilistic structure of the problem. Typically, we have a number of representative samples of what we want to model. In an approach known as Bayesian learning <ref> [18] </ref>, these samples are used 24 to estimate the unknown probabilities which in turn are used as if they were the true values. It is important to distinguish between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Reference-contexts: We achieve this by modulating the frequency characteristics of the wavelet basis with a rational function (which is a reciprocal polynomial) of appropriate order. To synthesize fractal surfaces, we convert the energies into probability distributions using ideas from statistical mechanics <ref> [20] </ref> and employ a multi-resolution stochastic relaxation algorithm. We will present some examples of the synthesized fractal surfaces in a subsequent section. Like any deformable surfaces, our multiresolution hybrid models can also be interactively manipulated to mold into desired shapes via the use of externally applied forces. <p> This is achieved via a 13 (a) (b) (e) (f) superquadric model, (c), (d), (e) & (f) global deformations generated by tweaking of coarse scale wavelet coefficients 14 technique of statistical mechanics conversion of energies into probabilities using Boltzmann, or Gibbs, distribution <ref> [20] </ref>. <p> As in [36], this difficult computation can be circumvented by generating random samples from the Gibbs distribution using a simple technique called the Gibbs Sampler <ref> [20] </ref>. In the Gibbs Sampler technique, at each iteration, a new random state is selected from the Gibbs distribution associated with the local energy function of the variable being updated. The convergence of this updating scheme to a random sample from the overall distribution is guaranteed.

Reference-contexts: The shapes will be accurately quantified by a parameter vector that can be used in computing shape measures such as volume. Volumetric analysis of structures contributes to understanding of various neurological disorders such as dyslexia, specific language impairement etc. (Leonard, et al., <ref> [22] </ref>). Nontrivial shapes, low contrast images and high noise levels in this application domain prompted us to take advantage of our statistical modeling scheme by incorporating object-specific information into our prior model.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the multiresolution hybrid models can be used to synthesize a variety of shapes that look natural in the context of interactive sculpting. We present some examples of these shapes in section 2. Earlier work reported in Pentland <ref> [30] </ref> on the use of wavelets in the context of shape modeling was limited to computational issues in surface fitting applications. He used wavelets basis to approximate the Eigen vectors of the stiffness matrix assembled in the finite element solution to the surface reconstruction problem using the thin-plate-membrane splines. <p> to be computed by a similarity transformation K 1 d = S T ^ K 1 d S, where ^ K 1 d represents the membrane 19 spectral density, ! 2 and an arbitrary density ! fi , (b) Increasing energy with increasing resolution stiffness matrix in nodal basis (see <ref> [30] </ref>). <p> computing K 1 d using this similarity transformation is the large computational cost incurred (O (N 3 ), where N is the number of nodal variables), which can be avoided by using the property that differential operators in wavelet basis remain sparse (see [1]) and have strong diagonal dominance (see <ref> [30] </ref>).

In the wavelet basis, the stiffness matrix is approximately diagonal and this approximate diagonalization leads to savings in storage space as well as computation time for the solution. In <ref> [33] </ref>, Sclaroff et al., report techniques for generalizing implicit function representation of shapes by use of modal deformations and displacement maps. The displacement map function is defined by using a bilinear interpolation between point samples and is stored as an image array. <p> Also, the modal deformations are assumed to be the free vibration modes of the object which simplifies the simulation of the dynamics of the object. The multiresolution pyramid method discussed in [12] and proposed for use in <ref> [33] </ref> has many limitations compared to a wavelet-based multiresolution representation as pointed out in Mallat [23]. Note that the wavelet-based pyramid is used in their work only for the data compression purposes.

Reference-contexts: Shape recognition a high-level vision task requires that the shape models be characterized by a small set of parameters. Lumped parameter models are thus better suited for such tasks. Some examples of lumped parameter models include, generalized cylinders [7], superquadrics [4, 29, 2] and the parametrically deformable models <ref> [52, 34] </ref>. Recently, a hybrid modeling scheme dubbed, "deformable superquadrics" was introduced by Terzopoulos et al., [42]. These models have the advantage of combining the descriptive power of lumped and distributed parameter models and thus, simultaneously satisfying the requirements of shape reconstruction and shape recognition. <p> The same level of detail may also be incorporated by using some existing modeling techniques <ref> [34, 42] </ref> but, at the expense of increasing the number of parameters tremendously. From a computational point of view, our modeling scheme is very attractive for segmentation purposes as multi-resolution relaxation is a natural by product of implementing the gradient relaxation method in the wavelet basis.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we will present a way to incorporate specific prior knowledge about the shape to be recovered from the data and then derive the mechanics of our modeling scheme. We cast the model fitting process in a probabilistic framework <ref> [35] </ref> and incorporate prior distributions on the vector of geometric parameters that are being estimated. The combination of prior and sensor models results in a Bayesian model, since the posterior distribution of the parameters we are trying to estimate conditioned on the data can be computed using Baye's rule.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we give a closed form expression for the stiffness matrix computation in the wavelet basis (see section 4.2) and employ a multiresolution relaxation process in solving the model fitting problem. Thin-plate-membrane splines were also used for a very different purpose by Szeliski et. al., <ref> [36] </ref> namely, generation of constrained fractals which are useful in representing natural images. They derive the fractal characteristics of the membrane and thin-plate splines and show that the membrane splines give raise to fractals of fi = 2 while the thin-plate splines yield fractals of fi = 4. <p> It has been used quite extensively for speeding up computations in solutions to problems in computational vision [39] and in computer graphics for generating stochastic fractals <ref> [36] </ref>. With the advent of the wavelet transform (WT), multi-resolution analysis of functions has become more attractive due to the fact that wavelet decomposition of a function into different frequency components allows for studying each component at a resolution matched to its scale. <p> The link between physically-based (deformable models) models and priors is conveniently established using a Gibbs distribution of the form <ref> [36] </ref> p (q) = Z p where E p (q) is the discretized version of the internal smoothness energy of the model, and Z p (called the partition function) is a normalizing constant. <p> The entries are organized as in a standard representation of images in wavelet basis (see figure 4 for the standard organization). 4.3 Prior Model of General Fractal Degree Splines and stochastic fractals are complementary techniques for modeling free-form shapes <ref> [36] </ref>. Splines are well suited for modeling smooth man made objects and are easily controlled. Fractals on the other hand are well suited for modeling irregular shapes and are difficult to constrain. <p> There is abundant literature on fractal generation algorithms and we refer the reader to relevant literature in [19, 48, 3]. However, these algorithms do not describe techniques to constrain fractals. Szeliski et. al. <ref> [36] </ref> describe a novel technique for constraining fractals by establishing a formal connection between splines and fractals using Fourier analysis of energy minimizing splines. 21 (a) (b) posteriori distribution, corresponding to a fractal surface (membrane model) Our prior model corresponding to the membrane spline is a Markov random field with a <p> Its spectrum can be determined using Fourier analysis techniques <ref> [36] </ref>. In their work on constrained fractals Szeliski et. al. [36] show how prior models corresponding to a membrane and thin-plate regularizers possess a spectral density proportional to ! 2 and ! 4 respectively, which are fractal i.e., they are self-affine over scale. <p> Its spectrum can be determined using Fourier analysis techniques <ref> [36] </ref>. In their work on constrained fractals Szeliski et. al. [36] show how prior models corresponding to a membrane and thin-plate regularizers possess a spectral density proportional to ! 2 and ! 4 respectively, which are fractal i.e., they are self-affine over scale. <p> Here, E denotes the dimension of the Euclidean space. In <ref> [36] </ref> fractals of an in-between fi namely, 2 fi 4 were approximated by blending the membrane and thin-plate terms. In contrast, our multi-resolution wavelet based modeling scheme discussed earlier allows us to construct fractals of any fi directly by utilizing the natural scale space characteristics of wavelet basis. <p> These surfaces were obtained by taking a representative sample from the associated Gibbsian distributions that describe the surface probabilistically. The explicit evaluation of the Gibbs distribution is very difficult due to the large computational requirements (summation overall possible states) in evaluating the partition function Z. As in <ref> [36] </ref>, this difficult computation can be circumvented by generating random samples from the Gibbs distribution using a simple technique called the Gibbs Sampler [20]. <p> We employ the multiresolution wavelet-based pyramid to accelerate the convergence by using the results at a coarse level as the starting point of the relaxation for a finer level. The implementation of the coarse-to-fine relaxation in a wavelet basis is quite different from that discussed in <ref> [36] </ref>. Specifically, after transformation of the nodal basis to the wavelet basis, the solution is obtained at a coarse resolution, to this solution, we add fine detail (detail function) and then recompute the new solution and so on.

These models have the advantage of combining the descriptive power of lumped and distributed parameter models and thus, simultaneously satisfying the requirements of shape reconstruction and shape recognition.
