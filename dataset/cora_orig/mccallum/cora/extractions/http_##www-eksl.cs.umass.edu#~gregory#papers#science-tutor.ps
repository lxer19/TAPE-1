Title: An Intelligent Tutor for High-level Science Skills  
Author: Dawn E. Gregory 
Date: February 2, 1996  
Abstract: This work builds on previous attempts at tutoring scientific skills. Rather than focus on individual skills or scientific domains, it stresses the tutoring of specific scientists: those unfamiliar with the methods and tools of science. The tutor provides a gradual introduction to science in the context of a specific scientific domain | in this case, the extinction of the dinosaurs. The tutor requires a student to construct one or more arguments in support of a scientific theory. Arguments are constructed by searching a hypertext knowledge base of scientific facts, problems, and solutions. Students acquire basic scientific skills through a guided learn-by-doing process. The tutor takes great care to introduce new information only when it becomes relevant to the student's experience and learning. As the student becomes proficient at certain skills, new topics are incorporated directly into the subject matter. Ideally, this tutoring environment can become a workbench in which students continue to pursue scientific studies throughout their educational experience.

Reference-contexts: One of the most likely reasons is lack of manpower: teachers have too many students to instruct each one individually. Thus, intelligent tutoring systems have the potential to significantly improve science education. The premier research in intelligent science tutors is that of Valerie Shute and her associates <ref> (Shute & Bonar 1986, Shute 1990, Shute & Glaser 1990) </ref>. This work focuses on teaching scientific skills such as exploration, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing, within the context of a specific domain.

Reference-contexts: This section describes the data structures and algorithms which enable both agents to perform their tasks. 4.1 Knowledge Structures Like other tutors designed to instruct scientific discovery skills <ref> (e.g. Shute 1990) </ref>, the tutoring knowledge is partitioned into two separate knowledge bases, distinguishing general scientific knowledge from knowledge of a specific domain.

Reference-contexts: My tutor was designed to assist students in acquiring each of these skills through firsthand experience. Belvedere <ref> (Suthers et.al 1994) </ref> is an intelligent tutor for argumentation skills. It provides a graphical environment in which students record important features of an argument in a model structure similar to a semantic network. Belvedere can examine the semantic viability of the argument by analyzing the logical structure of the model.

Reference-contexts: In my own work, I am developing an intelligent agent which supports scientists in discovery activities <ref> (Gregory 1995) </ref>. This agent, called the Scientist's Empirical Assistant (SEA) uses planning and heuristic reasoning to help a scientist build a logical model of a scientific problem. SEA's plan library formalizes the scientific process as a hierarchy of goals and the various activities that can achieve each one.

Reference-contexts: The prescription is to be encouraging, allow students to explore, and to allow sufficient time and materials for students to accomplish their task. The design of the tutor is based on these policies, plus one more: the student is never given the opportunity to be wrong. Suchman <ref> (Suchman 1962) </ref> describes a framework for teaching inquiry skills in which the student is given the role of a scientist. After a brief film clip which shows a scientific experiment being performed, students are allowed to ask yes-or-no questions in order to develop an explanation of what they have seen.
