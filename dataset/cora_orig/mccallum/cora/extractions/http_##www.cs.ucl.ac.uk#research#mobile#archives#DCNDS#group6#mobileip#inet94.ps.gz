Title: Internet Mobile Host Protocol  The Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP)  
Author: Charles E. Perkins Andrew Myles David B. Johnson 
Note: Proc. INET '94 JENC5 Perkins, Myles, and Johnson  
Abstract: This paper describes the Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP), which allows transparent routing of IP packets to mobile hosts in the Internet, while using only the mobile host's home IP address. No changes are required in stationary hosts that communicate with mobile hosts, and no changes are required in mobile hosts above the IP level. IMHP quickly converges to optimal routing following the movement of a mobile host, while maintaining the weak security model of today's Internet. Detailed examples of operation are presented.

Reference-contexts: When this situation arises, a mobile host may use a technique called popup [3] to maintain connectivity. The popup method applied to IMHP requires the mobile host to acquire a temporary local address from a local address server (for example, a server implementing DHCP <ref> [2] </ref>) and to then report the allocated address to its home agent as its care-of address. The mobile host, in effect, acts as its own foreign agent, using this temporary address.
