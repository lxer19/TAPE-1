Abstract: We consider large optical networks in which nodes employ wavelength-routing switches which enable the establishment of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels, called lightpaths, between node pairs. We propose a practical approach to solve routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) of lightpaths in such networks. A large RWA problem is partitioned into several smaller subproblems, each of which may be solved independently and efficiently using well-known approximation techniques. A multicommodity flow formulation combined with randomized rounding is employed to calculate the routes for lightpaths. Wavelength assignments for lightpaths are performed based on graph-coloring techniques. Representative numerical exam ples indicate the accuracy of our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This problem is NP-complete, and the minimum number of colors needed to color a graph G (called chromatic number (G)) is difficult to determine. However, there are efficient sequential graph coloring algorithms which are optimal in the number of colors used <ref> [2] </ref>. In a sequential graph coloring approach, vertices are sequentially added to the part of the graph already colored, and new colorings are determined to include each newly-adjoined vertex. At each step, the total number of colors necessary is minimized. <p> Then, (G) max 1in min fi; 1 + deg (v i )g: Determination of a sequential coloring procedure corresponding to such an ordering will be termed the largest-first algorithm. The proof is straightforward and can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The determination of a vertex ordering that minimizes k was derived in <ref> [2] </ref> and can be found in the following procedure: 1. For n = j V (G) j, let v n be chosen to have minimum degree in G. 2. <p> The fact that any smallest-last vertex ordering minimizes k over the n! possible orderings is shown in <ref> [2] </ref>. We employ the smallest-last coloring algorithm to color our lightpaths.
