Reference-contexts: See Figure 5. The information content quantifies the conservation of each column and is related to the contribution of the column to the protein-DNA binding energy <ref> [BvH87] </ref>. The information content is computed using the standard formula = lg ( ) + lg (9) Second, to help evaluate the quality score of an alignment reported in a search, each weight matrix page also has a link to a graph of log-fraction of sites quality score.

It is distributed in relational form for a PC RDBMS and in flat file form.
