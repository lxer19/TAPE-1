Abstract: We propose an approach for reasoning about message integrity protection in cryptographic protocols. The set of axioms presented herein relate design parameters and assumptions of message integrity protection mechanisms to generic message integrity threats. Comparison of threat properties derived using these axioms with the policy goals for integrity protection aids in assessing the strength (or lack thereof) of message integrity protection mechanisms. We provide examples to illustrate the use of our approach in examining the weaknesses of message integrity protection mechanisms, and also in suggesting modifications in their design parameters. Cryptographic protocols, and in particular, authentication protocols, rely on message integrity protection. However, mechanisms for protecting message integrity have been shown to be error-prone ([3], [4], [14], [18], [20]). Past studies of message integrity have focused primarily on finding attack scenarios in message integrity protection mechanisms, suggesting solutions to eliminate vulnerabilities, and proposing new algorithms for message integrity protection [2], [3], [4], [5], [14], [15], [18], [21]. Recently, an operational model for message integrity, and a general method for designing message integrity protection mechanisms was also proposed [21]. However, to date, analysis of message integrity protection mechanisms has been done in an ad-hoc manner. A method which considers the types of threats that the environment is exposed to and analyzes protection mechanisms to determine whether they achieve their goals 3 has not been proposed. An analysis method that relates design attributes and assumptions of message integrity protection mechanisms to message integrity goals is useful in (1) analyzing extant protection mechanisms for their threat resistance properties, (2) designing new protection mechanisms, and (3) to help gain insight into properties of message integrity protection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a set of axioms which model the threats to message integrity in a given environment. These axioms relate the design parameters and assumptions of message integrity protection mechanisms to generic message integrity threats. Comparison of threat properties derived

Reference-contexts: The analysis of protection mechanisms has also suggested modifications in their design parameters to remove existing vulnerabilities. Although the axioms presented herein mainly concern shared key cryptosystems, this reasoning can be extended to public-key cryptosystems (i.e., those that use RSA scheme <ref> [17] </ref> or variants thereof) as well. We provide some guidelines on how this may be done in Appendix A. In our model of computation (section 2), we assume that messages are broken up into blocks and that the encryption algorithm is applied to each of these blocks. <p> The second objective may not be relevant in cryptographic protocols using public-key cryptosystems (i.e., those using the RSA scheme <ref> [17] </ref> or variants thereof), since finding the ciphertext for plaintext amounts to finding the encryption key which is publicly known.
