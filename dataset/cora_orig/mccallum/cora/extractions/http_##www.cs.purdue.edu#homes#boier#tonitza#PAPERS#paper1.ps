Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction To gain insight into biological processes scientists need to know where the atoms are located in biological molecules and how they change during biochemical reactions. In his delightful book on protein structure <ref> [1] </ref>, Max Perutz explains how `protein crystallography has opened a submicroscopic world were potential drug targets can be mapped out in atomic detail' and drugs can be made to measure for a variety of diseases from hypertension to HIV, how proteins recognize each other, and how they recognize genes. <p> Macromolecular Crystallography. In 1912 Max von Laue discovered that x-rays are diffracted by crystals and one year later W. L. Bragg founded x-ray analysis <ref> [1] </ref>. In his Nobel, lecture Bragg explains the foundation of x-ray analysis: "the rays are diffracted by the electrons grouped around the center of each atom. In some directions the atoms conspire to give a strong scattered beam, in others their effects almost annul each other by interference.

Reference-contexts: Biological molecules differ in their complexity, small proteins have several thousands of atoms while large macromolecules like viruses could have millions of atoms. For example a protein like streptavidin has some 7,000 atoms while the monkey tumor virus has 900,000 non-hydrogen atoms <ref> [2] </ref>. Structure determination of small molecules has become a routine process nowadays. In contrast, the determination of macro-molecular structures such as viruses remains a lengthy and difficult task. <p> Finally, in the model building phase, high resolution electron density maps, information gathered through EM studies, and chemical information allow the structural biologist to determine the 3D atomic structure. According to Hendrickson <ref> [2] </ref>, 484 new atomic level structures were determined in 1994, 352 by x-ray crystallography, 100 by NMR spectroscopy, and 1 each by fiber diffraction and electron microscopy. <p> ; y j ; z j ) measured in fractions of unit-cell lengths, then the electron density distribution is given by 1 X F (h) exp (2ih r) Macromolecular crystallography requires a sequence of experimental and analytical steps namely crystallization, diffraction measurements, phase evaluation, density map interpretation, and model refinement <ref> [2] </ref>. Here we discuss only the evaluation of phases, and the model building. Phase evaluation. The x-rays scattered by biological molecules infer both constructively and destructively, producing a diffraction pattern which can be recorded on a photographic emulsion or using a CCD detector. <p> Density map interpretation and model building. The atomic model of a macromolecule can be build using high resolution, 2-3 A, electron density maps. If phases are accurate, a polypeptide chain can be traced at about 3.5 A, and individual atoms are isolated at about 1.2 -A <ref> [2] </ref>. Graphics tools like O (see Table 1) designed by Alwyn Jones are invaluable in this step. Electron Microscopy. In correlation with x-ray diffraction, biochemical, genetic, immunological, and model building studies, image processing of electron micrographs is a powerful tool for investigating the basis of molecular events in living systems.

Reference-contexts: Structural biology uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), x-ray crystallography, and electron microscopy (EM) methods to gather information about the 3D atomic structure of large macromolecules like proteins and viruses. Then, intricate computations, often involving parallel computers <ref> [3] </ref>, are used to refine the experimental data and produce high resolution electron density maps in the case of x-ray crystallography, or to reconstruct the 3D structure in the case of electron microscopy. <p> Considerations like the ones described above provided the motivation for Tonitza, an interactive package for the visualization, analysis, and data manipulation developed in collaboration by scientists in the Computer Sciences Department and Structural Biology Group at Purdue University. This collaboration allows the use of high performance computing <ref> [3] </ref> and advanced graphics systems for structural biology. Tonitza is aimed at the field of structural biology, but it can be used to explore any vector field data.

Reference-contexts: Digital methods offer distinct advantages because they are quantitative and adaptable. The main disadvantage of such methods comes from the necessity for discrete sampling of data, which leads to aliasing artifacts which can be reduced, but never completely eliminated. A typical digital processing procedure includes several steps <ref> [4] </ref>. (a) Image selection: after an initial screening by eye (to discard obvious bad images), several micrographs (50 or more) are examined by optical diffraction to select a small subset of the best images in terms of optical quality and specimen preservation (note that optical diffraction is generally unsuitable for selecting <p> Yet, when data visualization and very specific computations are tightly coupled together, the use of generic graphics packages looses some of its appeal. For example, it is sometimes necessary to correlate two EM reconstructions of a spherical virus <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Using memory mapping of large data files proved to be a significant step to improve the I/O performance. Then there was the need for interactive manipulation of the objects displayed, for viewing selected volumes from arbitrary positions, for animating individual frames <ref> [4] </ref>. Efficient algorithms were not enough to achieve the real-time effect, given the large data sets. This motivated the first major change in the design of Tonitza: portability was traded for in-teractivity and we redesigned the package to take full advantage of graphics hardware by using Open GL.

Reference-contexts: Tonitza consists of a graphical user interface, and I/O, computation, and visualization modules. On-line context-sensitive help uses hypertext viewers (Mosaic 4 or Netscape 5 ). The user interface is based on X-Windows 6 and Motif 7 . The interface has been designed in a direct manipulation style <ref> [7] </ref> which has proven quite powerful and easy to learn. It consists of a large main window and various smaller auxiliary windows. The main window appears on the screen at the beginning of a Tonitza session, and it remains on the screen for the entire duration of the session.

Reference-contexts: One example when such a feature proves useful is the 3D reconstruction of a virus from independent 2D views obtained by electron microscopy methods <ref> [8] </ref>. The input data sets in this case may represent two different views of the same particle in different orientations. The maximization of the correlation between them may be used to determine the orientation of one relative to the other. <p> This can be subsequently displayed in various representations and may give some insight about the relationship between the two maps. A special case is the difference of two data sets. Color plate 2 (a) shows a shaded surface representation of the Ross-River virus <ref> [8] </ref> in its native form (blue) together with Fab antibody fragments attached to it (yellow). The yellow surface corresponds to a map computed as the difference between data representing the complex form of the virus attached with antibodies and the native virus structure.
