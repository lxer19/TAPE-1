Abstract: In this work we focus on the problem of acoustic signals modeling and analysis, with particular interest in models that can capture the timbre of musical sounds. Traditional methods usually relate to several "dimensions" which represent the spectral properties of the signal and their change in time. Here we confine ourselves to the stationary portion of the sound signal, who's analysis is generalized by incorporating polyspectral techniques. We suggest that by means of looking at the higher order statistics of the signal we obtain additional information not present in the standard autocorellation or it's Fourier related power-spectra. It is shown that over the bispectral plane several acoustically meaningful measures could be devised, which are sensitive to properties such as harmonicity and phase coherence among the harmonics. Effects such as reverberation and chorusing are demonstrated to be clearly detected by the above measures. In the second part of the paper we perform an information theoretic analysis of the spectral and bispectral planes. We introduce the concept of statistical divergence which is used for measuring the "similarity" between signals. A comparative matrix is presented which shows the similarity measure between several instruments based on spectral and bispectral information. The instruments group into similarity classes with a good correspondance to the human acoustic perception. The last part of the paper is devoted to acoustical modelling of the above phenomena. We suggest a simple model which accounts for some of the polyspectral aspects of musical sound discussed above. One of the main results of our work is generalization of acoustic distortion measure based on our model and which takes into account higher order statistical properties of the signal.

Reference-contexts: the main problems to our oppinion is the control of timbral properties both for analysis and as a means for its production, with a heavy emphasis on the question of "similarity and difference" which is essential for any form of organization and stands at the basis of every cognitive activity <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus we chose to treat the issue mainly from the signal processing point of view, regarding the acoustic signal as a stochastic process and suggesting a new approach for its treatment.

It is apparent that in the first signal x (n), the 3 is an independent harmonic component because 3 is an independent random-phase variable. On the other hand 3 in y (n) is a result of phase coupling between 1 and 2 .

Reference-contexts: try to show that these phenomena effectively influence the bispectral contents of the signal, and thus might be explained on this basis. 3.1 Researches related to Sound Quality of Musical In struments The first attempts to use bispectral considerations for sound quality characterization can be traced down to Michael Gerzon <ref> [6] </ref>, to whom we are indebted also for many of the following ideas. The power spectrum, which is generally used for sound characterization, being "phase-blind", cannot reveal the relative phases between the sound components. <p> If b = b in for original signal, then after reverberation b out = (1 + k) 3=2 b in . Thus for a reverberation energy gain k, the relative bispectral level has been reduced by a factor (1 + k) 3=2 <ref> [6] </ref>. Now consider a very similar effect of chorusing.

Reference-contexts: To simplify matters, the discussion focuses on discrete signals. Some of the important relationships and properties of finite impulse response (FIR) signals and linear, time invariant systems are briefly reviewed. The results for general non-linear systems are more complex and require the use of Voltera-Wiener system theory <ref> [7] </ref>, which is beyond the scope of this presentation. 7.1 Multiple Correlations and Cumulants Extracting information from a signal is a basic question in every branch of science.

Reference-contexts: The harmonicity and time coherence factors aren't independent factors though. Psychoacoustics research has pointed out several auditory cues central to the perception of spectral blend. It has been shown that harmonicity of the frequency content and coherence between the spectral elements are the major factors influencing spectral blend <ref> [10] </ref>. 2.1 Harmonicity sensitivity "Harmonicity measure" concerns the degree of existence of integral ratios among the harmonics of the tone [11]. Various experiments were conducted by psychoacousticians that indicate that processing of harmonicity as spectral pattern is a central auditory process. <p> All natural, sustained-vibration sounds contain small-bandwidth random fluctuations in the 1 See Appendix 4 frequencies of their components. There are several experimental results that demon-strate frequency modulation coherence importance for perceptual fusion. McAdams <ref> [10] </ref> explained these results on the basis of an assumption about existence of mechanisms in our ear system that respond to a regular and coordinated pattern of activity distributed over various cells in the system. <p> In recent times a more quantitative acoustical studies point out several features in the temporal and spectral behavior of the sounds which are pertinent for instrument recognition and modeling spectral blend [11]. We suggest to realize the power of polyspectral techniques for the analysis of spectral blend. McAdams <ref> [10] </ref> reported about several experimental results that support the notion that frequency modulation coherence contributes to perceptual fusion.

Various experiments were conducted by psychoacousticians that indicate that processing of harmonicity as spectral pattern is a central auditory process. Harmonic tones fuse more readily than inharmonic tones under similar conditions and the degree to which inharmonic tones do fuse is partially dependent on their spectral content. <p> Originally treated in semi-empirical way by the orchestration manuals, vague criteria for evaluating orchestral choices were presented.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly enough this theoretical criterion seems to be satisfied by many orchestral instruments. For example, particular cases of Stradi-varius violin (435 Hz, 535 Hz, 930 Hz), Contrabassoon (245 Hz, 435 Hz, 690 Hz) and Cor Anglais (985 Hz, 2160 Hz, 3480 Hz). In a later work, Lohman and Wirnitzer <ref> [16] </ref> analyzed two flutes by calculating their bispectra. Their results demonstrate that a higher intensity of the phase of the complex bispectra is achieved for the flute of good quality.

The estimation of the model parameters still remains in a large a difficult problem, with some aspects of estimation already presented in <ref> [33] </ref>. The generalization of the acoustic distortion measure according to our model enables to combine spectral and bispectral information into a common equation. The results of clustering musical sound using this distorion will be reported in a future work.
