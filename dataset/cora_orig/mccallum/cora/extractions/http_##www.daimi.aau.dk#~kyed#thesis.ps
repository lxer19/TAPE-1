Title: Square Integrable Representations and the Continuous Wavelet Transformation  
Author: Thesis by Mads Kyed () 
Date: January 6, 1999  
Affiliation: Aarhus University  
Abstract: We investigate square integrable representations ae of locally compact groups G. We show how ae is unitary equivalent to a subrepresentation jK of the left regular representation of G on L 2 (G). We provide an expression for the projection onto K. We prove the orthogonality relations for square integrable representations. We introduce the Continuous Wavelet Transformation associated to a square integrable representation. Finally we construct a class of square integrable representations with powerful Continuous Wavelet Transformations associated.

Reference-contexts: The resulting continuous wavelet transformations are therefore natural generalisations of the one-dimensional continuous wavelet transformation into higher dimensions. Some examples will illustrate this in more detail. The theory of this chapter is mainly due to Bernier and Taylor (see <ref> [3] </ref>) 7.1 The Group Let H be a closed subgroup of GL n (R). H is then a locally compact topological group with a left Haar measure dh. We set G := R n o H, the semi-direct product of R n and H.

Reference-contexts: We give an explicit expression of a unitary equivalens and characterize its range in L 2 (G) by giving an explicit expression for the projection onto it. The explicit expression of the projection was given originally by Carey in <ref> [4] </ref>. The original proof is based on the spectral decomposition theorem of unbounded operators. We present a different proof without making use of the spectral decomposition theorem. In chapter 5 we prove the orthogonality relations for square integrable representations of locally compact groups (not necessarily uni-modular). <p> The characterisation of this subspace is done by giving a simple expression of the projection onto it. We shall in fact show that it is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This result is originally due to Carey (see <ref> [4] </ref>). The following proof is different from Carey's. <p> The following proof is due to Carey <ref> [4] </ref>. 5.1 Subrepresentations of We start by establishing orthogonality relations for an irreducible representation oe := jK . denotes the left regular representation of G on L 2 (G) and K a subspace of L 2 (G). We denote the projection of L 2 (G) onto K by P .

Reference-contexts: Remark 5.1.1. The requirements 1 and 2 above are actually unnecessary. If the map f 7! f fl p is a projection, it is positive. A straightforward calculation implies p to be positive definite. 1 then follows from 13.7.7 in <ref> [5] </ref>. The requirement that f 7! f fl p is a projection implies f fl p fl p = f fl p for all f 2 L 2 (G). It follows that p fl p = p and hence 2.

Reference-contexts: The above arguments are of heuristic nature. A more detailed study of the connection between the support of L and an optimal sampling grid may be found in section 4.4 in [9]. In image analysis we often encounter the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) (see <ref> [7] </ref>). Since the restrictions of the analyzing wavelet in the CWT are weaker than the restrictions in the DWT, the CWT becomes more flexible in retrieving information from an image. Hence the CWT is often prefered for this usage.

Reference-contexts: The ability to detect singularities is a useful property as well. Singularities arise on the boundary between two regions. Thus this property makes the CWT highly useful in detecting edges and contours. A comprehensive study of the detection capabilities of the CWT can be found in [2],[1] and <ref> [8] </ref>. When implementing the CWT in algorithms, the problem of selecting evaluation points for L arises. Determining the size of the sampling grid is often very crucial. Inclusion of too many points causes redundancies and ineffective algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The effectiveness of this procedure is strongly dependent on the choice of group G and representation ae. In order to illustrate how effective the procedure can be, we look at the example from section 7.4.3. The CWT from this example has been thoroughly investigated in <ref> [9] </ref>. We recall from section 7.4.3 that an element of G is of the form (x; k; ), where x 2 R 2 , k 2 R + , and 2 [; ]. <p> The reliability of such a grid is usually adequate. The above arguments are of heuristic nature. A more detailed study of the connection between the support of L and an optimal sampling grid may be found in section 4.4 in <ref> [9] </ref>. In image analysis we often encounter the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) (see [7]). Since the restrictions of the analyzing wavelet in the CWT are weaker than the restrictions in the DWT, the CWT becomes more flexible in retrieving information from an image.

Reference-contexts: For any fixed g 2 L 2 (R) one can also prove continuity of the map y 7! T y g from R into L 2 (R) (see IV.4 in <ref> [12] </ref>). <p> Therefore it follows that 8a 2 R n f0g : F ( b f () b f 0 (a)) = 0 (116) The Fourier transformation on L 1 (R) is injective (see VII.2 in <ref> [12] </ref>), thus 8a 2 R n f0g 9 null-set N a : b f (x) b f 0 (ax) = 0 f or all x 2 N a (117) and hence 0 = 1 1 j b f (x) b f 0 (ax)j 2 dxda = 1 1 j b f <p> b OE (ay) b (y) ( fl D a ~ OE)(y) dyda 33 6.2 The &lt; ax + b &gt; group As the Fourier transformation is an algebra homomorphism of the convolu tion algebra (L 1 (R); +; fl) into the algebra (C 0 (R); +; ) (see VII.2 in <ref> [12] </ref>) we find: Z j &lt; ; oe (x)OE &gt; j 2 dx = 2 1 1 a b OE (ay) b (y) b (y) D a ~ OE (y) dyda = 2 1 1 a b OE (ay) b (y) b (y) D a b ~ OE (y) dyda = <p> Thus ff fl is one-to-one. ff fl is obviously onto and continuous. We need only to show that it is open. This follows from theorem II.6 in <ref> [12] </ref>, which is a version of the "Open mapping theorem". In the case where U is free, the connection between the measures dh and U will follow as a consequence of the subsequent lemma. Lemma 7.2.3. Let m and be regular Borel measures on H. <p> Thus both I m and I are right Haar measures on H. By uniqueness of right Haar measures on locally compact groups (see III.10 in <ref> [12] </ref>), the two measures are proportional. Let c be a non-zero constant such that I m = c I .

By the Little Riesz Representation Theorem (see 12.5 in <ref> [13] </ref>) there exists a unique element oe i (OE) in H such that 8j 2 H : (j) =&lt; j; oe i (OE) &gt;(6) Hence by (4): 8j 2 H : &lt; j; oe i (OE) &gt;= G Clearly the map oe i (OE) is linear and by (7) it satisfies <p> Thus oe i (OE) 2 Dom (T flfl ). Since T is a densely defined closed operator, Dom (T ) = Dom (T flfl ) (see 13.12 in <ref> [13] </ref>). Hence oe i (OE) 2 Dom (T ). Thus by (16): 8j 2 Dom (T fl ) : &lt; i (OE)T ; j &gt;=&lt; T oe i (OE); j &gt;(17) By 13.12 in [13], Dom (T fl ) is dense in H . <p> a densely defined closed operator, Dom (T ) = Dom (T flfl ) (see 13.12 in <ref> [13] </ref>).

Hence (17) implies that T oe i (x) = i (x)T . We conclude (x)T T oe (x). The above theorem enables us to use an intertwining operator of two representations to intertwine the associated integrated representations. <p> U 0 U fl 0 is clearly self-adjoint.

(50) 4.3 Characterising the square integrable representations of G Since U 0 is an isometry and U 0 U fl 0 is idempotent, both R (U 0 ) and R (U 0 U fl 0 ) are closed. <p> Since M ( 1 2 ) is closed and densely defined, it follows from 13.13 in <ref> [13] </ref> that the graph of M ( 1 2 ) jDom (M ( 1 2 ) fl M ( 1 2 )) is dense in the graph of M ( 1 2 ). <p> Since C 1 2 is self-adjoint it is closed (see 13.9 in <ref> [13] </ref>) and therefore we must have C 1 1 2 f . <p> From the definition of D, we know D 2 = kpk 2 C. From 1 in lemma 5.1.5 we know that C is positive and self-adjoint. It follows that D 2 = E 2 is positive and self-adjoint. By theorem 13.31 in <ref> [13] </ref>, D 2 = E 2 has a unique positive self-adjoint square root, so we must have D = E. This shows uniqueness of D. Now suppose G is uni-modular. <p> Such elements exist. As an example, elements 2 C 1 c (R) with 0 =2 supp ( ) have F 1 ( ) satisfying both 1 and 2 (it follows from 7.4 in <ref> [13] </ref> that F 1 ( ) 2 L 1 (R)). Consequently oe is square integrable. Having verified that oe is square integrable, we can look at the associated continuous wavelet transformation. Let OE be an analyzing wavelet. Let f 2 L 2 (R). <p> Dom ((T fl T ) 2 )=Dom (T ) Proof: 1. Since for all x 2 Dom (T fl T ): &lt; T fl T x; x &gt;=&lt; T x; T x &gt; 0 (191) it follows that T fl T is positive. From 13.13 in <ref> [13] </ref> we have that T fl T is self-adjoint. 2. This follows from 13.31 in [13]. 3. <p> From 13.13 in <ref> [13] </ref> we have that T fl T is self-adjoint. 2. This follows from 13.31 in [13]. 3. <p> Since T is closed, the graph G (T ) of T is a closed subspace of H 1 fi H 2 and thus a Hilbert space. Set T 0 := T jDom (T fl T ) . By 13.13 in <ref> [13] </ref> G (T 0 ) is dense in G (T ). Similarly since (T fl T ) 1 2 is closed, G ((T fl T ) 1 2 ) is a closed subspace of H 1 fi H 1 and hence a Hilbert space. <p> 2 x; (T fl T ) 2 y &gt; H 1 =&lt; x; y &gt; H 1 + &lt; x; (T fl T )y &gt; H 1 since y 2 Dom (T fl T ) =&lt; x; (I + T fl T )y &gt; H 1 9.2 By 13.13 in <ref> [13] </ref> R (I+T fl T )=H 1 , which by the calculation above implies: &lt; x; z &gt; H 1 = 0 f or all z 2 H 1 (193) and thus x = 0.
