Abstract: We inhabit an environment in which the vertical axis is of special significance. It is the line along which the local force of gravity is exerted, and which extends perpendicularly from the surface about which we navigate. It also indicates the general direction of natural scene illumination, and is the axis to which we self-orient for most day-to-day activities. Developers of 3D virtual environments must also be aware of the significance of the vertical axis if a `natural' user experience is intended. This paper describes a selection of important vertical axis cues, and asserts that their use can significantly improve the user's understanding of the virtual environment. It then considers the issue of vertically-aware 3D view specification. A number of constrained viewing models are identified which inhibit the specification of `unnatural' world views in which the user may feel disoriented.

Reference-contexts: The use of a textured plane is particularly effective, as the patterning helps in the perceptual interpretation of the plane's orientation <ref> [1] </ref>. of reference from which a judgement can be based. In Figure 1 (b) a ground plane has been introduced, which immediately indicates that both the objects and the viewer are tilted slightly to the left.

Reference-contexts: Up and down now became an even stronger influence on an animal's structure, because appendages were needed for locomotion across the ground. .. As for left and right, the situation on land or in the air remained as symmetrical as in the sea. <ref> [2] </ref> The vertical asymmetry of the terrestrial environment has undoubtedly shaped many aspects of human physiology, from the methods of locomotion which are supported, to the arrangement and structure of the body's major sensory and manipulatory components.

Reference-contexts: Pixel-sized primitives such as these usually cost very little in image rendering overheads, and only a small number of particles are required to to communicate a variety of useful cues. Falling particles convey view orientation information through the principle of optical flow <ref> [3] </ref>. This relates to the observed particle trajectories which appear to emerge from a specific point of origin, and later converge upon a second destination point. The effect of optical flow in depicting view orientation is shown in Figure 2 (dotted trails are included here to indicate particle velocities).

Reference-contexts: Roll annulment of this kind may also be applied to head-tracked systems to maintain an upright view. However, the use of such a technique is liable to cause visual proprioceptive conflict, as the displayed image may disagree with the user's vestibular perception <ref> [4] </ref>. 4. Conclusions The 3D environment in which we live is not similar in all directions, but is markedly differentiated about the vertical axis. This differentiation affects both the visual appearance of our surroundings, and the manner in which we choose to position and orient ourselves within the scene.

Reference-contexts: Visual cues are known to be of fundamental importance in the psychological determination of upwardness, and can override physical phenomena such as proprioceptive or gravitational cues <ref> [5, 10] </ref>. A selection of vertical axis cues are described below. Often the provision of these cues will also help in the user's interpretation of other aspects of the environment, such as the presentation of depth information. These effects are described where applicable. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: This example also suggests that the viewer is lying on his right-hand side. The perception of depth within otherwise empty regions of space is also made possible through the use of snow. This can help in understanding spatial relationships between objects <ref> [6] </ref>. The distance of an individual snow particle can be inferred from its apparent angular velocity, and may also be illustrated using intensity-based depth cues, or by view disparity in a stereoscopic system. 2.4.

Reference-contexts: This is followed by a discussion of view orientation methods which allow the user to maintain vertical awareness as the environment is explored. 2. The interpretation of virtual environments An environment must be spatially differentiated if the observer is to determine his self-localization <ref> [7] </ref>. An observer's vertical awareness within a virtual environment may therefore be promoted through the explicit introduction of pictorial cues to provide a means of establishing orientation [9].

Reference-contexts: A view specification may be separated into rotational and translational components. This discussion limits itself to considering only the rotational components, as these solely determine the vertical axis alignment of the displayed image. See Mackinlay et al. for an examination of the translational aspects of view specification <ref> [8] </ref>. The key to maintaining vertical axis alignment throughout the exploration of a 3D scene is to impose constraints on the views which may be specified.

However, upward illumination of this kind is not in accordance with natural expectations, and such a setup may result in the misinterpretation of surface shape <ref> [10] </ref>. Note, for example, that the swelling on the right-hand end of the cylinder may easily be mistaken for a hollow under such conditions. Figure 3 (c) shows a more appropriate vertical lighting arrangement, with illumination directed from above. 3.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 (c) illustrates another useful function of the ground plane as a receptor of shadow information. Shadows play an extremely important role in the interpretation of position and size relationships in 3D scenes <ref> [11] </ref>. The provision of a ground plane may therefore be a significant aid to scene interpretation if shadows are included within the lighting model. 2.2. Backdrops A simple method for the portrayal of scene orientation is to use a backdrop.

Reference-contexts: Here, the hand-held input device is used to alter the posi tion and view direction of the eye-point within the scene. * Head tracking. In this approach the view position and direction are related to the motion of the user's head, making it particularly suitable for immersive systems <ref> [12] </ref>. A view specification may be separated into rotational and translational components. This discussion limits itself to considering only the rotational components, as these solely determine the vertical axis alignment of the displayed image.

Reference-contexts: Precisely how this is achieved depends upon the view navigation model which is in use. 3.1. Navigation models A variety of methods are commonly used to specify changes of viewpoint in the navigation of 3D virtual environments <ref> [13] </ref>. These include: * The `scene in hand' metaphor. In this approach, the position and orientation of the entire scene is adjusted in direct correspondence to the movements of a hand-held input device. * The `eyeball in hand' metaphor.
