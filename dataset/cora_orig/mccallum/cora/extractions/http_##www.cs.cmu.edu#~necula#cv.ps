Abstract: The certifying compiler complements my earlier work on Proof-Carrying Code (PCC), which is a general technique for safe and efficient execution of untrusted code. PCC prescribes that the code producer attaches to the code an easily checkable formal proof that the code adheres to a safety policy established by a code receiver. This enables the receiver to execute the code without the overhead of interpretation or runtime checking. The certifying compiler is, therefore, an automatic front-end to a PCC system for type safety.
