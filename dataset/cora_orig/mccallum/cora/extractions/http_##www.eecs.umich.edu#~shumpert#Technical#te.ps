Title: Penetration Through Slots in Conducting Cylinders: Part 1, TE Case

Abstract: Three methods for determining the penetration through small apertures in closed conducting surfaces are outlined and their salient features discussed. These methods are designated (i) the scatterer method, (ii) the short-circuit current method, and (iii) the equivalent current method. They are implemented by integral equation techniques but are amenable to differential equation or hybrid methods. Procedures for applying each method are outlined as are schemes for repairing singular equations rendered invalid by the presence of false resonances. Reasons for inaccuracies in the three methods are also delineated. Data determined for a given structure by all three methods are presented and numerical examples that illustrate important features of the methods and their relative accuracies are described. It is pointed out that some methods yield incorrect penetration data. In this part of the paper, the TE (to cylinder axis) case is presented. In Part 2 is found an outline of the integral equation formulations and numerical schemes needed to accurately determine the field that penetrates through a slot in a conducting cylinder, excited by an axially-independent TM source.
