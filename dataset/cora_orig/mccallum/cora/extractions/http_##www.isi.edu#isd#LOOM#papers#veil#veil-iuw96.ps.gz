Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction VEIL performs high level interpretation of scene images using the deductive capabilities of the Loom knowledge representation system <ref> [MacGregor and Bates 1987, Brill 1993] </ref>,, and provides users with semantically-enriched browsing and editing capabilities. The VEIL experiments use a database of RADIUS Model Board 2 image site models stored in SRIs RCDE system.

Reference-contexts: The definition can then be used as a guide to what other objects should be present. It can be used to drive the reasoning. This type of reasoning was used in another part of the VEIL project that identified runways <ref> [Price et al. 1994] </ref>. 2.2.2 Contexts Loom has a context mechanism that allows one to maintain distinct assertion sets. Looms contexts are organized hierarchically, which allows inheritance. Siblings are separate, so this allows information about different scenes to be kept separate, but in the same lisp image.
