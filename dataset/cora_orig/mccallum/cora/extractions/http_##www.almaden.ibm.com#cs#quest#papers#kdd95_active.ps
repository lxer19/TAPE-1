Abstract: We introduce an active data mining paradigm that combines the recent work in data mining with the rich literature on active database systems. In this paradigm, data is continuously mined at a desired frequency. As rules are discovered, they are added to a rulebase, and if they already exist, the history of the statistical parameters associated with the rules is updated. When the history starts exhibiting certain trends, specified as shape queries in the user-specified triggers, the triggers are fired and appropriate actions are initiated. To be able to specify shape queries, we describe the constructs for defining shapes, and discuss how the shape predicates are used in a query construct to retrieve rules whose histories exhibit the desired trends. We describe how this query capability is integrated into a trigger system to realize an active mining system. The system presented here has been validated using two sets of customer data.

Reference-contexts: Complex shapes can be derived by recursively combining elementary shapes and previously defined derived shapes, using the shape operators. We have presented these operators in <ref> (Agrawal et al. 1995) </ref> and given their formal semantics, expressive power, and implementation techniques. These operators are summarized in Table 1. We give syntax for each operator and how the corresponding derived shape is matched in a history H.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Data mining (Stonebraker et al. 1993) (also called knowledge discovery in databases (Piatetsky-Shapiro & Frawley 1991)) is the efficient discovery of previously unknown patterns in large databases, and is emerging as a major application area for databases (Gartner Group 1994) (Business Week 1994). In <ref> (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993) </ref>, three classes of data mining problems involving associations, sequences, and classification were introduced and it was argued that these problems can be uniformly viewed as requiring discovery of rules embedded in massive data. Attached to every dis fl Current address: Politecnico di Torino, Dip. <p> Such active systems can be used, for instance, to build early warning systems for spotting trends in the retail industry. For example, if we were mining association rules <ref> (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993) </ref>, we will have histories for the support and confidence of each rule 1 . Following the promotion 1 An association rule (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993) is an expression of the form A ) C, where both A and C are sets of literals. <p> For example, if we were mining association rules <ref> (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993) </ref>, we will have histories for the support and confidence of each rule 1 . Following the promotion 1 An association rule (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993) is an expression of the form A ) C, where both A and C are sets of literals. <p> The second dataset from a market research company that provides marketing information to the retail industry consisted of three years of roughly 6.8 million point-of-sales transactions. In both the cases, we divided data on monthly basis and mined association rules <ref> (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993) </ref> for each dataset. For rules discovered, we saved three parameter histories for each rule in the rule-base: support, confidence, and the product of sup port and confidence values.

Reference-contexts: We can now query the rulebase using predicates that select rules based on the shape of the history of some or all parameters. The user can specify triggers <ref> (Dayal, Hanson, & Widom 1994) </ref> over the rulebase in which the triggering condition is a query on the shape of the history. As the fresh data comes in for the current time period, the mining algorithm is run over this data, and the rulebase is updated with the generated rules. <p> We use the ECA (Event Condition Action) model (Chakravarthy et al. 1989) as the basis for our trigger system. We lean on the rich literature in active databases (see <ref> (Dayal, Hanson, & Widom 1994) </ref> for an overview) and specialize it for our purpose. The interesting aspects of our trigger system are what can be specified as trigger conditions, the semantics of the trigger execution, and how it is used in the active mining process.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the shape drift: (shape drift (width) (in width (precisely 0 (any up Up down Down)))) has no ups or downs in width time periods. Earlier languages based on regular expressions for finding patterns in sequences (see <ref> (Seshadri, Livny, & Ramakrishnan 1995) </ref> for a review of some of them) were not targetted at defining shapes. The difference in design focus influences which expressions are easy to write, understand, optimize, and evaluate.

Reference-contexts: Wave Execution Semantics Several semantics have been proposed for trigger systems in active databases (see <ref> (Simon, Kiernan, & de Maindreville 1992) </ref> for a discussion). The execution semantics for our trigger system follows what we call the wave execution model. This semantics is close to what is known as the deterministic semantics for Datalog-like rules (S.Ceri, G.Gottlob, & L.Tanca 1990).

Reference-contexts: That is, the specified event combination has occurred for some rule. The condition section is syntactically and semantically similar to the query construct discussed in Section Queries. The difference is that the condition is evaluated only on rules present in the affected set <ref> (Widom & Finkelstein 1990) </ref> produced by the events section, instead of the whole rulebase. A condition selects the affected set of rules from the rulebase and performs the specified shape query on the relevant histories of those rules.
