Reference-contexts: While I don't pretend to have the key to r esolving the software engineering crisis, I believe its solution may rest with building systems from the bottom up using robust and stable cooperatives of goal-driven modules locked into long-term prisoners dilemmas <ref> [2] </ref>, instead of through the centralized planning of top-down design. The order of acquisition of stable behaviors can be very important to the solution of hard problems. 3.4.
Reference: [3] <editor> M. F. Barnsley, Fr actals Everywhere, </editor> <publisher> Academic Press, </publisher> <address> San Diego, </address> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: There is a clear link between simple fractals, like Cantor dust, and rewriting systems ("remove the middle third of each line segment"), and Barnsley h as shown how such recursive structures can be found in the limit behavior of very simple dynamical systems <ref> [3] </ref>. The very notion of a system having a "fractional dimension" is in fact the recognition that its apparent complexity is governed by a "power law" [22].

Reference-contexts: It is the language of symbol manipulation which is locked to a specific environment of human language and deliberative problem-solving.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that there are limiting factors to software engineering <ref> [5] </ref>, and these limits could be orders of magnitude below the number of "lines of code" necessary to account for thousands of psychological regularities or to achieve a "general intelligence."

Reference-contexts: code" necessary to account for thousands of psychological regularities or to achieve a "general intelligence." Since software engineers haven't figured out how to build and maintain programs bigger than 10-100 million lines of code, why should people in AI presume that it can be done as a matter of course? <ref> [7] </ref>. What is missing is some control principle for maintaining dynamical coherence of an ever-growing piece of software in the face of powerful winds of change.
Reference: [8] <author> N. Chomsky, </author> <title> Syntactic structures, </title> <publisher> Mouton and Co., </publisher> <address> The Hague, </address> <year> 1957. </year>
Reference-contexts: the garden path of theories expressed in rules and representations because simple mathematical models, using ordinary differential equations, neural networks, feedback control systems, stochastic processes, etc. have for the most part been unable to describe or explain the generativity of structured behavior with unbounded dependencies, especially with respect to language <ref> [8] </ref>. This gulf between what is needed for the explanation of animal and human cognitive behavior and what is offered by ordinary scientific theories is really quite an anomaly and indicates that our understanding of the principles governing what goes on in the head have been very incomplete.

Reference-contexts: fundamental result, Crutch-field & Young have exhaustively analysed sequences of most-significant-bits generated by this map 2 and have shown that at critical values of k, s uch as 3.5699, these bit -10- sequences have unbounded dependencies, and are not describable by a regular grammar, but by an indexed context-free grammar <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Even though any other programming language would serve, the tradition in American AI is to build systems from scratch, using LISP, or to build knowledge into production systems. Newell is happy to represent the "symbolic cognitive psychology" tradition (p. 24) against the paradigmatic revolutions like Gibsonianism <ref> [10] </ref> or PDPism [21]. A third way we can distinguish between competing universals is to appeal to scientific goals outside of building a working program. We can stipulate, for example, that the "most natural" way to model a phenomenon in the UPL must support extra-disciplinary goals.

Reference-contexts: Research in non-linear systems theory over the past few decades has developed an alternative explanation for the growth and control of complexity <ref> [11] </ref>. Hidden within the concept of deterministic "chaotic" systems which are extremely sensitive to s mall changes in parameters, is the surprise that precise tuning of these parameters can lead to the generation of structures of enormous apparent complexity, such as the famous Man-delbrot set [14].

Reference-contexts: Indeed the myths are principally supported by his arguments, both the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis <ref> [16] </ref>, which is the assertion that Universal Computation is enough, and the Knowledge Level Hypothesis [17], which legitimizes theories involving only software laws, even though their very existence is based only upon introspection.

Reference-contexts: In other words, neural networks are merely the biological implementation level for a computation theory not based upon symbol manipulation, but upon complex and uid patterns of physical state. A survey of c ognitive models based upon non-linear dynamics is beyond this review <ref> [20] </ref>, however, I can briey point to certain results which will play an important role in this alternative unification effort. Research in non-linear systems theory over the past few decades has developed an alternative explanation for the growth and control of complexity [11].

Reference-contexts: The very notion of a system having a "fractional dimension" is in fact the recognition that its apparent complexity is governed by a "power law" <ref> [22] </ref>. The equations of motion of non-linear systems are not different in kind from those of simpler physical systems, but the evoked behavior can be very complicated, to the point of appearing completely random.

Reference-contexts: these cases, when pressed to the point of providing the same theoretical capacity as a formal symbol system, I was forced to interpret these connectionist networks from a new point of view, inv olving fractals and chaos -- a dynamical view of cognition, more extreme than that proposed by Smolensky <ref> [23] </ref>. I have thus been lead to a very different theoretical basis for understanding cognition, which I will call the "Dynamical Cognition Hypothesis," that: The recursive representational and generative capacities required for cognition arise directly out of the complex behavior of non-linear dynamical systems.
