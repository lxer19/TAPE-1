Abstract: The main objective of the OSISIM project (Open System Integrated Simulator) is to set up an atelier for the modelization of communication networks and the analysis of their performances. The atelier gives the end-user powerful tools to edit a communication system in a graphical environment. The representation of a system to be simulated is based on models of several standard networks available in the library which is the kernel of the atelier. Each model implements uniform and well-defined sets of functions, while having clearly specified interfaces. This article describes the architecture of the atelier, and focuses on the internal structure of basic models.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The main objective of the OSISIM project is to set up an atelier for the modelization of communication networks and the analysis of their performances. In the literature, we find the description of different toolkits dedicated to this field, as TOPNET <ref> [1] </ref>, which is based on PROT net, a class of Petri nets; NETMOD [2], which is based on simple analytical models; BONeS [3], which is based on block-oriented modeling paradigm. On the other hand, our approach is based on queueing networks.

Our atelier, named AMS (Atelier for Modelization and Simulation), has to integrate the facilities and the tools in such a way as to be easy to use by the end-user.

Reference-contexts: That is why we have to build basic models, which will make up other models of more complex systems. Each basic model implements uniform and well-defined sets of functions, while having clearly specified interfaces. This paper describes, in the first section, the architecture of the AMS <ref> [4] </ref>. The second section focuses on the internal structure of a basic model [5], and the ways to reduce the code related to its behavior. I. Description of AMS I.1.
