Abstract: The CLEO collaboration is constructing a silicon vertex detector composed of double sided silicon, each side providing an orthogonal position measurement. The silicon detectors have an insulating layer between implants and readout strips which provides AC coupling. The construction of this detector has presented many interesting challenges which will be reviewed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: This requires us to gang together 3 pickup traces for every readout trace, introducing a 3-fold ambiguity in the determination of track position in z. The front end electronics for the SVX is based on CAMEX <ref> [1] </ref> chips. The CAMEX is a 64 channel sample and hold with multiplexed readout. Each channel uses double correlated sampling in which the previous measurement is subtracted from the current measurement. This is supposed to have the effect of removing pedestal variations and suppressing common mode noise.
