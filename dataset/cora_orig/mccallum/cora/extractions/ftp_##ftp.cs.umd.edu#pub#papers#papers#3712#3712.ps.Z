Abstract: We introduce a preconditioner for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations that is effective when either the discretization mesh size or the viscosity approaches zero. For constant coefficient problems with periodic boundary conditions, we show that the preconditioning yields a system with a single eigenvalue equal to one, so that performance is independent of both viscosity and mesh size. For other boundary conditions, we demonstrate empirically that convergence depends only mildly on these parameters and we give a partial analysis of this phenomenon. We also show that some expensive subsidiary computations required by the new method can be replaced by inexpensive approximate versions of these tasks based on iteration, with virtually no degradation of performance.

Reference-contexts: An analogous idea is used in the definition of "distributive relaxation" schemes for multigrid methods applied to the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, see <ref> [3, 30] </ref>. F p is also defined using periodic boundary conditions for the discrete pressures. It is then straightforward to prove the following lemma by direct calculation. Lemma 3.1.

This issue is also a critical one for multigrid methods for the Navier-Stokes equations <ref> [3, 27, 28, 30] </ref>. It is difficult to make a simple comparison between the methods proposed here and multigrid; most reported studies show a dependence on viscosity (or Reynolds number) but not on mesh size [27, 28, 30].

As defined, the BFBt preconditioner requires several costly subsidiary computations. For each step of GMRES, the preconditioning entails the action of Q 1 where Q is given by (4).

It is difficult to make a simple comparison between the methods proposed here and multigrid; most reported studies show a dependence on viscosity (or Reynolds number) but not on mesh size [27, 28, 30]. <p> This issue is also a critical one for multigrid methods for the Navier-Stokes equations [3, 27, 28, 30]. It is difficult to make a simple comparison between the methods proposed here and multigrid; most reported studies show a dependence on viscosity (or Reynolds number) but not on mesh size <ref> [27, 28, 30] </ref>. An advantage of the BFBt preconditioner is that it can be applied easily to systems arising from mixed finite elements with different grids for velocities and pressure (as shown in Table 3).
