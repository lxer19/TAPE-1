Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Segmentation is a critical element in image analysis and pattern recognition. The function of segmentation is to identify the homogeneous regions in an image based on properties such as intensity, colour, texture, etc. Many different approaches to this problem exist, and may be categorized as follows <ref> [1, 32] </ref>: 1. edge detection algorithms, where the focus is on the dissimilarities between two regions. 2. grouping or forming algorithms, which are concerned with the similarities between regions as a basis for merging. This paper is primarily involved with region forming.

Reference-contexts: One method involves a functional description of the homogeneous regions together with the use of regression functions to fit an optimal surface to the region. The error associated with the surface fit and the correlation between adjacent surfaces measures the homogeneity of that area <ref> [9, 30, 2, 18] </ref>. In our method, we look at homogeneity from a different perspective. Instead of functional characterization of homogeneous regions, we classify pixels by examining the statistics of other pixels in their neighbourhood.

Reference-contexts: Colour is a primary analytical property of an image. Adding colour to the list of region properties increases the computation cost but facilitates greater insight into the homogeneity of regions. Various attributes of colour have been used in similar and different segmentation approaches <ref> [7, 3, 23, 17, 28] </ref>. However, Ohta et al [28] and Ohta [27] show that no significant difference is observed in results obtained when different sets of colour features are used. <p> We have adopted the Nicol's algorithm for labeling the regions. 9 5 Experimental Results The absence of widely accepted mathematical models for images has made the objective evaluation of segmentation algorithms difficult. Therefore, a subjective visual evaluation is usually presented for the output of the algorithms <ref> [11, 27, 3] </ref>. <p> Even though some effort has been expended to provide an objective measurement [16], it is believed that the proposed measurement can not be generalised, rather, the amount of useful information provided by the segmentation algorithm to the succeeding stages of analysis is one of the best criteria <ref> [3] </ref>. Indeed, dealing with a large number of regions (information) at the higher levels of image analysis may be crippling for any system. Therefore, minimizing the number of regions, whilst maintaining expected perceptual groupings in the image, can be a very useful criterion.

Various attributes of colour have been used in similar and different segmentation approaches <ref> [7, 3, 23, 17, 28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Accurately setting thresholds relies on using the properties involved in measuring similarities between two regions. For this purpose, two different methods are used. In the first method, thresholds are set by measuring some probabilistic features of regions such as mean and variance. For example, in Gupta et al's algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>, regions are grown based on two statistical tests. For this purpose, the variance and mean of a small pixel group is compared with the variance and mean of already formed neighbour regions.

Reference-contexts: In addition, if the light intensity varies linearly within a region R and we insist that the intensity be approximately constant within the region, then there will be artificial boundaries formed within R [29]. Due to the essential identity of edge detection and region growing <ref> [9] </ref>, using edge information for region growing is another approach. For example, Yakimovsky [33] employs the likelihood function to test the strength of the edge occurring in a local area. <p> One method involves a functional description of the homogeneous regions together with the use of regression functions to fit an optimal surface to the region.

Reference-contexts: This method also needs to store region properties in memory, and moreover, no distribution is presented for the calculated statistic. Gradient information has also been used by Haralick and Dinstein <ref> [10] </ref> for growing the regions. Generally, gradient based operators are known to be sensitive to noise.

Reference-contexts: This paper is primarily involved with region forming. There are different approaches for region forming such as spatial clustering, region growing, and split and merge schemes. For a complete survey of segmentation algorithms, the reader is referred to Haralick and Shapiro <ref> [11, 32] </ref>, In this paper, we consider algorithms suited to pixel data, sequentially digitized at video rate. Among popular methods for image segmentation, region growing techniques are best suited to pixel stream oriented processing. In our algorithm, small regions in the image are merged using local information. <p> For this purpose, the variance and mean of a small pixel group is compared with the variance and mean of already formed neighbour regions. If the comparison satisfies a particular criterion, the candidate region is grown and the mean and variance of that region updated. Similarly, Haralick and Shapiro <ref> [11] </ref> propose a statistical t-test for comparing each single pixel with its adjacent regions in a raster fashion. If the computed statistic indicates, the new pixel is added to the region, and the mean and variance of the region is updated. <p> It is shown that by using feedback from edge information in the image to set an adaptive threshold, leakage problems, which are a common disadvantage of region growing approaches <ref> [32, 11] </ref>, are improved. This algorithm produces a segmented image with a unique label assigned to each homogeneous region, and uses a real-time, parallel pipelined architecture. Colour is a primary analytical property of an image. <p> M 1 = fp : (p 2 fa; lg)^(homog (p)_ (lef t merge (x)^(p = l))_ (above merge (x)^(p = a)))g Due to V shaped regions in the image, region labeling needs to be performed in two passes <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> We have adopted the Nicol's algorithm for labeling the regions. 9 5 Experimental Results The absence of widely accepted mathematical models for images has made the objective evaluation of segmentation algorithms difficult. Therefore, a subjective visual evaluation is usually presented for the output of the algorithms <ref> [11, 27, 3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this, the N observations from the two samples are ordered to form the set Z (i) : i = 1; :::; N , where Z (1) Z (2) :::: Z (n) . The statistic J is defined as follows <ref> [13] </ref>: J = d i=1;:::;N jF m Z (i) G n Z (i) j (1) where m and n are as before, d is the greatest common divisor of m and n, and F m (a) = number of X 0 s a m G n (a) = number of Y <p> To resolve these problems, the statistic J 4 may be combined with an estimate of intensity uniformity around the pixel. For this purpose, the desired confidence level for homogeneity around the pixel is set less than or equal to 25%. Based on this confidence level, from Table A.23 in <ref> [13] </ref>, if J 4 5; the center pixel of the window, x, is considered to be a part of a homogeneous region.

Reference-contexts: In our algorithm, the three components of colour are used as different spectrums of signal information, which helps to achieve a more accurate classification. 2 Region homogeneity A commonly used definition of image segmentation <ref> [14] </ref> states that if I is the set of all image pixels, a segmentation of the image is a set of all connected subsets or regions R 1 ; R 2 ; :::; R N such that: N [ R i = I where R i " R j = ;

Reference-contexts: If the computed statistic indicates, the new pixel is added to the region, and the mean and variance of the region is updated. A similar idea, but in reverse, is used by Levin and Shaheen <ref> [17] </ref> who define a statistic to avoid an increase in intensity dispersion in a previously formed region when a candidate pixel is added to it. In these region growing techniques, storage capacity is needed to update region properties during region growing. <p> Colour is a primary analytical property of an image.

Reference-contexts: But, due to snaking regions in the image, the procedure of labeling is not so simple. In this regard, some sequential connected components algorithms are presented. Lumia's algorithm <ref> [20] </ref> performs nearly identical operations in both passes, as well as a reduced label equivalence table, making it attractive for a hardware implementation.

Reference-contexts: This procedure is repeated for all unprocessed cells until all cells are processed. Another advantage of the Kolmogorv-Smirnov test is its ability to discriminate between some kinds of textured regions. This has been discussed by Muerle <ref> [21] </ref>. 3 Testing for Homogeneity To test the null hypothesis (which determines homogeneity), a small neighbourhood around the pixel (a 5fi5 window) is spatially partitioned into two parts in four different orientations as shown in Figure 2. An edge is identified when the null hypothesis is rejected.

Reference-contexts: To compare the cdf of two adjacent sub-samples, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used. Among non-parametric statistical methods, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is more suited for comparing the cdf 's of small samples of populations [34], and has already been used for region growing by Muerle and Allen <ref> [22] </ref>. The method which they use in this test is not suitable for a pixel stream oriented algorithm, since they first segment the whole image into small cells with sizes of 2 fi 2; 4 fi 4; or 8 fi 8; and compute the cdf of each cell.
