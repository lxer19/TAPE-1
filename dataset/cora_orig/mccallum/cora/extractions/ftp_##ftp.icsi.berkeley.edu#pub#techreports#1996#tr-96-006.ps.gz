Abstract: For slotted networks carrying full multi-media traffic to work successfully, it is essential that connection setup and management is done well under all traffic conditions. Major challenges remain with the current state of the technology, however, particularly on how one copes with traffic bursts. Existing reservation-based networks do not allow the user to dynamically adjust his bandwidth requirements on demand. In this paper we propose a new scheme, called the reservoir scheme, which allows dynamic and distributed resource allocation. The basic idea behind the scheme is to reserve bandwidth with a guaranteed bit rate for each virtual circuit. The user is allowed to decentrally allocate additional bandwidth from an Available Bit Rate (ABR) reservoir to satisfy dynamic changes of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. The duration and bandwidth of this dynamic access are negotiated in the call setup phase and do not require any renegotiation with the service provider so that this solution overcomes the rigidity of current static bandwidth reservation schemes. The additional management requirements are low compared to other dynamic bandwidth reservation schemes. We also describe an analytic model and simulation which we used to determine whether it would be practical to apply the proposed scheme in a slotted network.

Reference-contexts: Whether a user is in a burst phase or not can be determined by considering the buffer utilization in the sender station, for example. 2 Different assignment strategies are discussed in <ref> [Gus95] </ref>. 6 If the buffer length exceeds a predefined threshold, a burst phase can be declared and the user may access no more than the S gratis slots allowed during each framing period. <p> These asynchronous slots circulated in the ring and were removed in the slot generator station. The bandwidth management was performed by a separate process implemented in the slot generator station. For more technical details and further case studies the reader is referred to <ref> [Gus95] </ref>. The simulation test scenario presented here is based on a proposal [XVI91] from an ITU study group. The network connected 32 active stations which were arranged at equal distances on a ring. The total length of the medium was assumed to be 10 Km. <p> The exact details of the experiment are described in the dissertation by Ulrich <ref> [Gus95] </ref>. 4.2 Results The simulation was run for 8000 framing periods, corresponding to an elapsed time of 1 second. This required about 3 hours and 50 minutes on a SPARC5 workstation of which around 45 minutes was required to generate the complete configured load scenario.

Reference-contexts: To analyse the MMBP [X ] (m) =(D + GEO )=1 K queueing model, we used an iterative approach based upon a method first introduced by Tran-Gia in <ref> [TG88] </ref> for analyzing G=G=1 K queueing systems. Unlike various standard continuous-time methods, this approach does not make use of the transition matrix and the corresponding solution of linear equation systems.

Reference-contexts: Other performance measures, such as loss probability, can then be easily computed from the queue length distribution. UWA allows one to efficiently compute the solution of queueing systems with MMBP phase-type arrival processes whose state spaces exceed one million states. The reader is referred to <ref> [UHK95] </ref> for a detailed description of the analytic model and its validation through simulation. 3.2 Results We chose a bandwidth of 2.4 Gbps and a standard frame duration of 125 microseconds for the network parameter values used to obtain the analytic results.

Reference-contexts: Although it was possible to derive some results from the simulation it also proved impossible to simulate a typical heavy load scenario because there were simply too many events at such high speeds. 4.1 Simulation Testbed The simulation testbed uses the Object-oriented Simulation of Slotted Communication ARchitectures (OSSCAR) class library <ref> [Ulr94] </ref>, developed at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg as a simulation tool for performance evaluation of slotted high speed networks. OSSCAR in turn, makes use of the Communication Network Class Library (CNCL) from the Technical University of Aachen [GJW93] which provides a powerful set of C++ classes supporting event-driven simulations.
