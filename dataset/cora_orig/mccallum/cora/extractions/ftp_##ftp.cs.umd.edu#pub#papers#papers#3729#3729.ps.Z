Abstract: The collaborative analysis of data within the Space Physics community is hindered, in part, by the wide number of data formats and the wide distribution of data archives. In an attempt to address these two problems we have implemented a prototype which retrieves datasets, stored in different data formats at several remote locations. Our prototype uses the Key Parameter Visualization Tools (KPVT) and the Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) to view data from the ISEE1, ISEE2, and ISTP programs. Our goal is to demonstrate the ability to access and use several types of remote data and existing analysis tools.
