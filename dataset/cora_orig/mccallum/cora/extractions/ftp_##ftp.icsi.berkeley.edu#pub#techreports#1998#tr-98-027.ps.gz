Abstract: The development of face recognition over the past years allows an organization into three types of recognition algorithms, namely frontal, profile, and view-tolerant recognition, depending on the kind of imagery and the according recognition algorithms. While frontal recognition certainly is the classical approach, view-tolerant algorithms usually perform recognition in a more sophisticated fashion by taking into consideration some of the underlying physics, geometry, and statistics. Profile schemes as standalone systems have a rather marginal significance for identification. However, they are very practical either for fast coarse pre-searches of large face databases to reduce the computational load for a subsequent sophisticated algorithm, or as part of a hybrid recognition scheme.

Reference-contexts: human body. 2.3.2 Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) While Hidden Markov Models have been used in speech recognition for more than a decade, and were also promoted for gesture recognition in recent years, only little work has been done on applying HMM to face recognition ([Samaria & Young 94], [Nyffenegger 95], <ref> [Achermann & Bunke 96] </ref>). HMM generally works on sequences of coherent 1D signals (feature vectors), while an image usually is represented by a simple 2D matrix. <p> A proper parallel hybrid recognition system integrating three face classifiers, namely the profile approach by [Yu et al. 95], an HMM algorithm similar to the one in [Samaria & Young 94], and the eigenface approach by [Turk & Pentland 91], was successfully presented by <ref> [Achermann & Bunke 96] </ref>. All three face classifiers return a ranking of Face Recognition: a Summary of 1995 - 1997 7 the possible person in ascending order of its score.

Reference-contexts: Although this method takes advantage of the shape information given in the frontal and profile images, it does not yet operate with an actual model of the head. In contrast, <ref> [Bichsel 95] </ref> presents a modular framework for shape from multiple views and varying illumination, which, in an iterative process, estimates a 2 1 / 2 D head model represented by a depth map and a corresponding texture map.

Reference-contexts: A special position among deformable model approaches is taken by morphing techniques that employ various methods to find suitable parameters (so-called morph fields) to represent the linear transition of one image into another. In this context, the recent algorithm by <ref> [Bichsel 96] </ref> generates optimum image morph fields based on distortion of geometry and illumination by maximizing the probability of the morph fields in a Bayesian framework. The method needs no training and is derived based on invariances and basic transformation groups.

Reference-contexts: However, since the paper mainly deals with estimating head models no recognition experiments are given. A similar approach to shape-enhanced face recognition is given by <ref> [Fromherz 96] </ref> who proposes a shape from multiple views and visual cues procedure embedded in a framework that allows consistent integration of additional visual cues.

Reference-contexts: The actual matching of a test profile with the variation models of all subjects happens by Face Recognition: a Summary of 1995 - 1997 3 calculating the distance between the test profile points and the corresponding extremal points of the variation models. A profile approach by <ref> [Gordon 95] </ref> in an overall valuation would belong to both the group of view-tolerant recognition and of hybrid procedures. <p> The system by <ref> [Gordon 95] </ref>, mentioned in the previous section, works with one frontal and one profile image. After identifying the head bounds in the frontal view, eye candidates are extracted using general eye templates, valley based pupil detection, and then structural knowledge the human head. <p> The latter approach can even go along with hybrid learning if the classifiers require training. As mentioned in section 2.3.1, the recognition method by <ref> [Gordon 95] </ref> already could be counted as a first attempt to build a hybrid system combining template-based frontal and profile recognition. Certainly, Gordon's profile approach only adds an additional template to the matching of the frontal templates and, therefore, does not constitute an independent recognition method.

Reference-contexts: T. Fromherz 2 In their paper about benchmark studies in face recognition, <ref> [Gutta et al. 95] </ref> independently came to the conclusion that holistic connectionist methods outperform discrete feature and correlation methods. <p> In a recent study of automatic face recognition systems, <ref> [Gutta et al. 95] </ref> finally came to the conclusion that the future in face recognition lies in the research of hybrid recognition systems. Different recognition approaches succeed and fail at widely different viewing and illumination conditions, which usually cannot be accommodated by day-to-day recognition systems.

Reference-contexts: An example of a proper serial hybrid classification scheme involving hybrid learning was presented by <ref> [Gutta et al. 96] </ref> who propose that intelligent hybrid systems include specific levels of knowledge, namely connectionist levels which can handle different sensory input and symbolic levels which are able to fuse data from different sensory modalities and cognitive modes. <p> The presented system for face and hand gesture recognition combines ensembles of radial basis functions (ERBF), a holistic template matching able to cluster similar images before classification, as the connectionist level with inductive decision trees (DT), an abstractive matching using discrete features, implementing the symbolic level. <ref> [Gutta et al. 96] </ref> proposed and tested two different ERBF architectures. ERBF1 separately trains the same three RBF nodes on three different sets of images, the original images, the original images distorted by Gaussian noise, and the original images distorted by a geometric transformation (rotation).

Reference-contexts: This happens by transforming the histogram of one image into the histogram of the other image employing a general form of histogram equalization. Data-driven algorithms can be found in the majority of the deformable model approaches. <ref> [Konen & Schulze 95] </ref>, [Wiskott et al. 95], and [Maurer & Malsburg 95], for instance, employ an elastic graph method that stores the faces as grids (graphs) with the characteristic facial features attached to the nodes of the graphs. <p> The elastic graph method is robust with respect to variations in pose, size, and facial expression of the head and can deal with different lighting conditions. The real world access control system 'ZN-face' reported by <ref> [Konen & Schulze 95] </ref> employs user-triggered semiautomatic image acquisition, allows fast identification in about 3.5 seconds, and can handle large databases of more than 1000 subjects due to verifying instead of recognizing a subject's identity. [Wiskott et al. 95] modified the elastic graph approach so that the nodes in the different <p> Another approach to recognition from a single view is given by [Lando & Edelman 95] who choose a representation of face images similar to <ref> [Konen & Schulze 95] </ref> and [Takcs & Wechsler 96]. Following biological visual systems where the sensitive regions of a neuronal unit is known as receptive field , the employed model represents face images by vectors of activities of graded overlapping receptive fields (RF).

Reference-contexts: Finally, recognition of a coded test image is achieved by matching the component vector of the test image against the ensemble components, for instance, using an Euclidean metric. Another approach to recognition from a single view is given by <ref> [Lando & Edelman 95] </ref> who choose a representation of face images similar to [Konen & Schulze 95] and [Takcs & Wechsler 96]. <p> Same-class objects like faces induce similar patterns (clustering) in RF space across varying viewing conditions (pose and illumination) and facial expression. <ref> [Lando & Edelman 95] </ref> propose a face recognition scheme consisting of three modules. The first employs radial basis function (RBF) classifiers, which accepts image representations in the high-frequency RF space thus detecting the viewing conditions.

The features are obtained by convolutions of the faces with Gabor wavelets computed at the node locations. <p> This is accomplished by checking whether the best fitting graph in the general face knowledge is mostly male or female and did or did not show evidence for beard or glasses. <ref> [Maurer & Malsburg 95] </ref> tackle the problem of single-view based recognition across varying view points by introducing a geometric transformation which acts on the encoded feature points (so-called jets) in the graph.

Reference-contexts: Since it is impossible to include all possible parameters of facial imagery in a face recognition model, data driven methods are employed to design key components of the model. One such method, used by various authors to automatically extract facial features, employs a wavelet decomposition of the images. <ref> [Phillips & Vardi 95] </ref>, for instance, present an adapted wavelet decomposition as key element of their matching pursuit filters to find the subtle differences between faces. The ability of wavelets to encode local information minimizes the effect of variations of background and facial expressions. <p> Repeating this procedure for all images in the gallery finally leads to the identification of the probe. <ref> [Phillips & Vardi 95] </ref> also present another application of data-driven algorithms, illumination normalization.

Reference-contexts: The combination of visual filters with radially nonuniform sampling allows illumination insensitive calculation of feature codes that subsequently are collected into compact face codes for later identification.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, profile recognition provides a simple means to support other approaches in a hybrid face recognition procedure. Pure profile algorithms are rare. <ref> [Yu et al. 95] </ref>, for instance, recently published a profile approach as a preliminary step towards a later integration into a hybrid recognition system. The procedure begins with a rule-based extraction of fiducial marks on the facial profile, which then are transformed into a one-dimensional canonical profile representation. <p> A profile approach by [Gordon 95] in an overall valuation would belong to both the group of view-tolerant recognition and of hybrid procedures. In contrast to <ref> [Yu et al. 95] </ref>, Gordon's approach extracts facial features merely to perform normalization and define template regions, which later are used for combined recognition of frontal and profile regions in a classical template matching process. The extraction techniques involve tangency constraints and heuristic knowledge about head structure. <p> It is important to notice that the profile enters the matching process by adding a limited region of the profile to the pattern matching process, and not as in <ref> [Yu et al. 95] </ref> by the geometry of the extracted feature points. Although this method takes advantage of the shape information given in the frontal and profile images, it does not yet operate with an actual model of the head. <p> A proper parallel hybrid recognition system integrating three face classifiers, namely the profile approach by <ref> [Yu et al. 95] </ref>, an HMM algorithm similar to the one in [Samaria & Young 94], and the eigenface approach by [Turk & Pentland 91], was successfully presented by [Achermann & Bunke 96].
