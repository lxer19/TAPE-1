Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION This document defines Chimera, the conceptual interface of IDEA. It constitutes a revised version of the first specification of Chimera, issued in June 1993 [1]. The major differences between the two specifications have been summarized in a short supplementary document <ref> [2] </ref>. Chimera consists of a conceptual model (also called Chimera Model, short: CM), providing object-oriented modelling facilities, and of a conceptual language (also called Chimera Language, short: CL), providing data definitions, declarative queries, procedural primitives for database manipulation, as well as various forms of rules and constraints.
