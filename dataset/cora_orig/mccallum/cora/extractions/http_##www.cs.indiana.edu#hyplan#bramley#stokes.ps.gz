Title: AN ORTHOGONAL PROJECTION ALGORITHM FOR LINEAR STOKES PROBLEMS  
Author: R. BRAMLEY 
Address: URBANA  
Affiliation: CENTER FOR SUPERCOMPUTING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS  
Abstract: A projection-based algorithm for solving symmetric indefinite systems is analyzed and applied to linear Stokes problems in CFD. Unlike other projection-based methods in CFD, this is a strictly linear algebraic approach that avoids the need to define boundary conditions for a pressure Poisson equation. The leading principal block need not be positive definite, and unlike reduced Hessian methods of nonlinear programming a null space basis matrix need not be created. No assumptions about the rank of the constraint block of the matrix are necessary. Advantages of using CG to solve the projected system are shown, and an approximation and preconditioning method is analyzed. After comparison with the preconditioned CG-accelerated Uzawa algorithm, the most commonly used iterative method for these problems, numerical results are given for problems arising in a large scale finite element industrial CFD code.

Reference-contexts: For nonlinear programming problems, A is usually a quasi-Newton updated matrix, with the update chosen numerically to keep A "safely " positive definite either by using an augmented Lagrangian approach <ref> [17, 2] </ref> or by using a partial update suggested by Powell [21].

Reference-contexts: This yields an inner-outer iterative method: each outer iteration requires multiplying by B T A 1 B, and each inner iteration requires multiplying by A. This approach has been successfully implemented in the industrial CFD code N3S by Electricite de France <ref> [3] </ref>. The algorithm analysed here can be similarly derived, but without assuming anything about the matrices A and B . Solve Au + Bp = f for p in a least-squares sense: p = B y (f Au), where B y is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of B.

Reference-contexts: Some of this work has concentrated on applying the projected system to the continuous model, instead of as a strictly linear algebraic solution method. For the general nonlinear programming problem, iterates are restricted more or less stringently to the manifold g 1 (0) <ref> [24, 10] </ref> with typical hypotheses including that the Jacobian matrix B = rg (x) is full rank for all x. Practical computational algorithms concentrate on two issues. <p> Reasons for avoiding the projected system are that it is singular (but consistent) whenever null (B T ) is nontrivial, and the computation of P and B y in general has in the past been considered impractical. According to Tanabe in 1979 <ref> [24] </ref>, his formulae using pseudoinverses " : : : are of little 5 value in practical computation, their main use being to give a geometric insight : : : ." Fletcher [7, page 88] also noted the relationship between solving the reduced Hessian system (11) and the projected system (10).
