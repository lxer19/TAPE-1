Title: A SURVEY OF 3-D INPUT DEVICES

Abstract: Three-dimensional user interfaces require the use of special input devices if they are to be exploited fully. After outlining the requirements of a 3-D input device, this paper examines several different techniques used for measurement along with the advantages and disadvantages of each. It then goes on to describe real devices that use each technique, some of which are research efforts while others are commercially available. Finally some trends are identified and suggestions for future work are made.

Reference-contexts: This is set up with the source on the HMD and the receiver on the hand, which allows the user a large range of movement without suffering from the polhemus' lack of usable range since the distance between source and receiver is at most an arm's length <ref> [Azum93] </ref>. A commercially available optical system is the RtPM from Spatial Positioning Systems, Inc. (Virginia, USA). This system, which sells for US$50,000 - US$70,000, uses lasers to locate an optical sensor. Measuring position and orientation (ie. 6 DOF) requires three laser transceivers.

Reference-contexts: The devices covered here were chosen to represent the major technologies currently in use. This means that no coverage has been given to early devices which, although historically interesting, have since been superseded. Examples of these are the Lincoln Wand [Rob66], a TOF acoustic tracker, and Twinkle Box <ref> [Burt74] </ref>, an early optical tracker. 3.1 Mechanical A currently popular form of 3-D input device is the forcesensing ball, typified by the Spaceball Technologies "Spaceball".

Reference-contexts: It is likely that the use of complex, interactive 3-D systems will necessitate a move away from "general purpose" input devices towards more useful, specific input devices, chosen for their applicability in a particular application <ref> [Buxt86] </ref>. For this reason users and designers of 3-D systems need to be aware of the wide range of input devices available and how they are used. 1.2 Requirements of a 3-D Interaction Device The specification of a point in 3-D requires three coordinates, (x y z).

Reference-contexts: In a simplified form of Card, Mackinlay and Robertson's taxonomy <ref> [Card90] </ref>, the "abs/rel" and "pos/force" columns indicate absolute or relative measurement of position or force (note that " D pos" means velocity). Notes: 1. Global 3D: Estimated update rate is based on maximum transmit speed is 9600 baud , 8 bits no parity, 1 stop bit (960 chars/s).

Reference-contexts: However, this would be a problem with any system of this type and as the ADL-1's creator Bill Chernoff has pointed out, using any other commercial system such as the Fake Space Labs BOOM 1 for similar head movements would be extremely difficult <ref> [Cher93] </ref>. At US$1500 the ADL-1 represents low-cost head tracking with very low latency. A device similar in concept to the ADL-1 is the Immersion Probe (Immersion Human Interface Corp., California USA).

Reference-contexts: Future research into 3-D interaction will need to consider interaction metaphors and how they relate to the devices being used. Metrics are required that go beyond simple calculations such as Fitts' Index of Difficulty <ref> [Fitt54] </ref> to become capable of discriminating between the good and bad application of 3-D input devices. 10 Appendix A Table A.1 gives details of the devices mentioned in this paper.

Reference-contexts: That said, the GLOBAL ball is expected to be mass-produced for US$100 by September/October 1993 <ref> [Glob93] </ref>, so this could be set to become very popular. One interesting extra feature is that a simple tactile feedback mechanism is included. This is provided in the form of vibration in the ball, programmable at one of 15 different intensity levels. <p> Notes: 1. Global 3D: Estimated update rate is based on maximum transmit speed is 9600 baud , 8 bits no parity, 1 stop bit (960 chars/s). Data packet is 2 characters <ref> [Glob93] </ref>, so 960 chars/s gives 480 updates/s. 2. QMW Bat: Estimated update rate is 160Hz based on 9600 baud, 8n1 comms with 6-byte data packet as described in [Slat90]. 3.

Reference-contexts: The Spaceball measures applied forces with 10-bit accuracy, enabling it to be used as a proportional controller increasing speed of movement with increased force for example. Informal observations suggest that new users generally take 10 - 20 minutes to become comfortable with the Spaceball <ref> [LeBl91] </ref>. One problem that users find with this device is that performing translation or rotation on one axis often affects another axis. This problem can be alleviated by reducing the sensitivity of the ball (usually done by pressing particular buttons on the unit itself).

Reference-contexts: Early models of the polhemus were not entirely suitable for head tracking since they featured a lag of 50-150ms after filtering 2 (25ms 1 Although the BOOM system <ref> [McDo90] </ref> includes a 6 DOF mechanical tracking system, it is ostensibly a stereoscopic display device (using CRT's) and as such was not included in this survey. 2 For a display refresh rate of 25 frames/s the maximum allowable lag would be 40ms. 6 unfiltered).

Reference-contexts: The device tracks the head with 6 DOF and features a 300Hz sample rate with quoted latency of less than 2ms. Latency is important when producing headslaved video images since too much delay between head movement and image update can cause nausea ("simulator sickness") in users <ref> [Oman91] </ref>. In use, the author has found that this device can be felt as a light weight pressing down on the head, causing a slightly disconcerting feeling of extra inertia when the head is moved.

Reference-contexts: Although the quoted resolution is the same as the Logitech (0.004"), apparently the designers of this system have taken great pains to include circuitry to discriminate between the "true" received signals and "false" signals such as reflections <ref> [PMS93] </ref>. Perhaps because of this the device is priced at 15,000.

Reference-contexts: The final mechanical device to be considered here is a product of research at Queen Mary & Westfield College, University of London.

As the device is moved in the horizontal x-y plane it generates relative signals much like a normal mouse. <p> Data packet is 2 characters [Glob93], so 960 chars/s gives 480 updates/s. 2.
