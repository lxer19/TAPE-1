Reference-contexts: First, the distribution satisfies the macro probabilities, R = A (); and secondly, maximizes the entropy. According to the product-form theorem, see (Kagan et al. 1973 <ref> [3, theorem 13.2.1, page 409] </ref>), this maximum entropy distribution (MED) is uniquely determined and has a product form, (z) = ae 1;z 1 : : : ae C;z C =G; (7) where the ae c;z c &gt; 0 are some real numbers, and G is a normalizing constant.

Reference-contexts: Numerical results for fork-join systems and for polling systems are presented in (Strelen 1991 <ref> [5] </ref>). CONCLUSION Product form approximations for the steady state probabilities of a quite general class of queueing networks are proposed, which are suitable for very large state spaces. Accuracy was empirically verified for many models, among others priority, polling, fork join, and blocking models.

Reference-contexts: But the state space is subject to a combinatorial explosion law. Therefore exact methods will never suffice This work was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for all models, approximation techniques are needed. We propose the disaggregation-aggregation (DA) iteration (Strelen 1997 <ref> [6] </ref>). This is a general approximate technique for finite Markov chains with discrete time which is based on aggregation. The calculated state probabilities are in product form; we call them disaggregation-aggregation product-form (DA) solutions. <p> ; u ;k (z) = z k 1; u ;i (z) = z i + 1; ff = k t h;i ; where t h;i denotes the transfer probability to node i. 2 DISAGGREGATION AGGREGATION ITERATION In this section we survey the DA method, details are given in (Strelen 1997 <ref> [6] </ref>). Our proposed solution technique needs disaggrega-tion: Given positive macro probabilities R, a distribution over Z T is defined as follows where is a n-vector with the probabilities (z); z 2 Z T . First, the distribution satisfies the macro probabilities, R = A (); and secondly, maximizes the entropy. <p> But in (Stre-len 1997 <ref> [6] </ref>) the existence of DA solutions is proven, and it is proven that there is always an aggregation with only a small number of aggregates for which an approximating product form (7) exists which is as accurate as desired. <p> Moreover, the accuracy could be substantially ameliorated in all examples if more and suitably chosen aggregates are considered. These matters are discussed in (Strelen 1997 <ref> [6] </ref>). 3 NUMERICAL EXAMPLES Here we consider the steady state probabilities of the component states. Other performance measures are calculated from them. Therefore their accuracy is of particular interest.
