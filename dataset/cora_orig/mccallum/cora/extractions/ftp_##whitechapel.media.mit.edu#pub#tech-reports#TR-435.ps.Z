Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 435 Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, Bombay, India, January 4-7, 1998 Abstract An algorithm for simultaneous detection, segmentation, and characterization of spatiotempo-ral periodicity is presented. The use of periodicity templates is proposed to localize and characterize temporal activities. The templates not only indicate the presence and location of a periodic event, but also give an accurate quantitative periodicity measure. Hence, they can be used as a new means of periodicity representation. The proposed algorithm can also be considered as a "periodicity filter," a low-level model of periodicity perception. The algorithm is computation-ally simple, and shown to be more robust than optical flow based techniques in the presence of noise. A variety of real-world examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The periodicity measure for an entire sequence is the maximum of p f averaged among pixels whose highest power spectrum values appear on the same frequency. The final periodicity measure is used to distinguish periodic and non-periodic motion by thresholding. In <ref> [3] </ref>, flow based algorithms are used to transform the image sequence so that the object in consideration is stabilized at the center of the image frame. Then flow magnitudes in tessellated frame areas of periodic motion were used as feature vectors for motion classification. <p> In practical situations, this is often the case. 4.1 Applications The proposed algorithm can be applied to motion classification and recognition. In [5], the shape of the active region in a sequence was used for activity recognition. In <ref> [3] </ref>, the sum of the flow magnitudes in tessellated frame areas of periodic motion was used for motion classification.

Reference-contexts: We do not expect the algorithm to segment out the walking person. Instead, regions of legs and arms and the outline of the bouncing head and shoulder should be identified. 1.2 Related Work The work of Polana and Nelson on periodic motion detection <ref> [4] </ref> is perhaps the most relevant to the approach presented in this paper. In their work, reference curves, which are lines parallel to the trajectory of the motion flow centroid, are extracted and their power spectra computed. <p> The resulting periodicity templates in Figure 13 show that, unlike optical flow based methods, the proposed algorithm is robust in the presence of noise. 4 Discussion Compared to the method used in <ref> [4] </ref>, the periodicity measure proposed here in the form of the temporal harmonic energy ratio is a more accurate and more reliable measure 6 Original AGWN Var=100 AGWN Var=400 Left column: original sequence.

Reference-contexts: However, this change should not be significant during the period of 64 frames when the distance between the camera and the object is sufficiently large. In practical situations, this is often the case. 4.1 Applications The proposed algorithm can be applied to motion classification and recognition. In <ref> [5] </ref>, the shape of the active region in a sequence was used for activity recognition. In [3], the sum of the flow magnitudes in tessellated frame areas of periodic motion was used for motion classification.

Reference-contexts: The proposed method is spectral based, and is computa-tionally efficient. fl This work was supported in part by IBM and NEC. 1.1 Our Approach The approach presented here is motivated by theory for textured image modeling that assumes an underlying random field representation of the data <ref> [6] </ref>. In particular, 1-D signals along the temporal dimension are considered as stochastic processes. When assuming stationarity, a stochastic signal can be decomposed into deterministic (periodic) and indeterministic (random) components. This is known as Wold decomposition [7]. <p> For spectral harmonic peak detection, we adapt the 2-D peak detection algorithm in <ref> [6] </ref> for 1-D signals. The signal along a temporal line is first zero-meaned and Gaussian tapered, and then its power spectrum computed via a fast Fourier transform.

In the frequency domain, the deterministic and the indeterministic components correspond respectively to the singular and the continuous part of the signal's Fourier spectrum.

Reference-contexts: It will be shown that frame alignment transforms data into a form in which periodicity can be easily detected and measured. To align a sequence to a particular moving object, the trajectory of the object is first detected. A filtering method similar to the one in <ref> [8] </ref> is used here to avoid the noise sensitivity of the optical flow based methods (demonstrated in Section 3). Applying 1-D median filtering along the temporal dimension of the sequence (filter length 11 was used for Walker), the resulting sequence has mostly the background.

Reference-contexts: Most of the related work uses flow based methods to locate moving objects in a sequence. However, the noise sensitivity of the flow based method can be a drawback. The optical flow magnitudes shown here were obtained by using the hierarchical least-squares algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>, which is based on a gradient approach described by [10] [11]. Two pyramids are built, one for each of the two consecutive frames, and motion parameters are progressively refined by residual motion estimation from coarse images to the higher resolution images.
