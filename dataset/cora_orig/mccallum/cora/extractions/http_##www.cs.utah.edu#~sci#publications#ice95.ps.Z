Abstract: We have developed an interactive computer model for defibrillation device design utilzing the Utah Torso Model [1]. This system allows researchers to interactively design and place electrodes into a high-resolution finite element model of the human thorax to investigate fields generated from electrical shocks. Several quantitative measures are used to determine the efficacy of different electrode configurations thus providing a useful tool for evaluating a wide variety of electrode configurations in an efficient manner. Currently the most promising electrode configuration candidates are being tested in animals as well as in clinical enviroments.

Reference-contexts: Computer models have recently become sophisticated enough to assist in studying the defibrillation problem. Early computer models usually required significant amounts of time to construct and change model paramaters such that relatively few electrode configurations have been simulated <ref> [2] </ref>. We have developed a defibrillation modeling system that allows a researcher to interactively design and place electrodes into a high-resolution finite element model of the human thorax (the Utah Torso Model). <p> Once the electrodes were defined, a volumetric mesh was generated by first creating a surface mesh consisting of triangles used to place the electrodes within the thorax surface triangles. Following the surface construction, volume points were automatically created and tesselated into tetrahedral elements using a Delaunay mesh generation algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. Dirichlet boundary conditions were then assigned to the electrode surfaces. The model was defined by over 20,000 surface points (including the electrodes). The resulting volume mesh (we created nearly 50 unique meshes to handle over 170 different electrode combinations) ranged from 1.2 million elements to 1.5 million elements.
