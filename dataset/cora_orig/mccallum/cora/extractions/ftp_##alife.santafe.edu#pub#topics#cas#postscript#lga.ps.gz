Note: LGA research is a highly developed subculture of general CA research. Some CA researchers are completely immersed in it, while others have barely heard of it. Rothman and Zaleski have a nice review article: Rev. Mod. Phys. 66 1417 (1994). The October, 1995 issue of the Journal of Statistical Physics was devoted to lattice gases. See the papers in that, and the secondary references. Also,  out comp-gas@xyz.lanl.gov, or find the comp-gas archive 1 You can retrieve papers from there, do searches, etc. See also: Bogosian 2 There will be a meeting on LGA 3  http://www.dur.ac.uk/TILDEdgl0jrh From: LUTHI Pascal &lt;luthi@cui.unige.ch&gt;  1
