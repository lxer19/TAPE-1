Abstract: MIT SchMUSE (pronounced "shmooz") is a concurrent, distributed, delegation-based object-oriented interactive environment with persistent storage. It is designed to run in a "capricious" network environment, where servers can migrate from site to site and can regularly become unavailable. Our design introduces a new form of unique identifiers called globally unique tickets that provide globally unique time/space stamps for objects and classes without being location specific. Object location is achieved by a distributed hierarchical lazy lookup mechanism that we call realm resolution. We also introduce a novel mechanism called message deferral for enhanced reliability in the face of remote delegation. We conclude with a comparison to related work and a projection of future work on MIT SchMUSE. This report is an editted and reformatted version of a report that appeared in the Proceedings of the 1995 Lisp Users and Vendors Conference, Cambridge MA, August 14-18, sponsored by the Association of Lisp Users (ALU). It was voted and selected best paper from the Student Presentation Contest by the conference attendees. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support for the laboratory's artificial intelligence research is provided in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-83-K-0125. Computer facilities to support the prototyping of this project were also provided, in part, by a generous equipment donation from Hewlett-Packard Company to the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
