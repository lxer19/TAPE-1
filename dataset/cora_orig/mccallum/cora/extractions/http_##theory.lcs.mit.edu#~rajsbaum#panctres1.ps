Abstract: Let T be a hamiltonian tournament with n vertices and fl a hamiltonian cycle of T . For a cycle C k of length k in T we denote I fl (C k ) = jA(fl) " A(C k )j, the number of arcs that fl and C k have in common. Let f(n; k; T; fl) = maxfI fl (C k )jC k T g and f(n; k) = minff(n; k; T; fl)jT is a hamiltonian tournament with n vertices, and fl a hamiltonian cycle of T g. In a previous paper [3] we studied the case of n 2k 4 and proved that * f(n; 3) = 1, f(n; 4) = 1 and f(n; 5) = 2 if n 6= 2k 2; * f(n; k) = k 1 if and only if n = 2k 2; * for k &gt; 5, f(n; k) = k 2 if and only if n 2k 4, n 6= 2k 2 and n k (mod k 2); * for k &gt; 5, f(n; k) = k 3 if and only if n 2k 4 and n 6 k (mod k 2). In this paper we consider the case of n 2k 5 and complete the description of f(n; k) by proving that f(n; k) = k 4 if and only if n 2k 5.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a tournament T is arc-pancyclic if given any arc e there are cycles of every length containing e. It is well known that a hamiltonian tournament is vertex-pancyclic, but not necessarily arc-pancyclic. In a previous paper <ref> [3] </ref> we introduced the concept of cycle-pancyclism to study questions such as the following. <p> If the later holds, i.e., every 2-chord is in T , then it follows from Theorem 2.1 (of [4]) that f (n; k; T ) k 3. 4 Conclusions Recall the following results from <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we use methods and results of <ref> [4] </ref> to complete the characterization of f (n; k) by proving that f (n; k) = k 4 if and only if n 2k 5. 2 Preliminaries A chord of a cycle C is an arc not in C with both terminal vertices in C. <p> In the rest of this paper T is a tournament of n vertices with a hamiltonian cycle fl = (0; 1; : : :; n 1; 0). Also we assume that n+5 2 k n 1. Thus k &gt; 5. The following theorem of <ref> [4] </ref> will be used. Theorem 2.1 ([4]) At least one of the following conditions holds. (i) f (n; k; T ) k 3. (ii) For each p, k 2 p n 2, every p-chord of fl is in T . 3 The Lower Bound In this section we prove the following <p> In any case it follows from Lemma 3.6 that f (n; k; T ) k 4 or every (n 2)-chord is in T . If the later holds, i.e., every 2-chord is in T , then it follows from Theorem 2.1 (of <ref> [4] </ref>) that f (n; k; T ) k 3. 4 Conclusions Recall the following results from [3]. Theorem 4.1 ([3]) f (n; k) k 2 if and only if n k (mod k 2).
