Title: Extending Dynamic Range by Combining Differently Exposed Pictures everyday scenes have a far greater dynamic
Author: Steve Mann and Rosalind W. Picard 
Note: On being `undigital' with digital cameras:  Most  show us highlight details of the scene that would be washed out in a "properly exposed" picture, while the light pictures show us some shadow detail that would also not appear in a "properly exposed" picture. The method is completely automatic; it requires no human intervention, and it requires no knowledge  
Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. TR-323 IS&T's 48th Annual Conference; Washington, D.C.; May 7-11, 1995; Society for Imaging Science and Technology, pages 422-428 Abstract We propose a means of combining differently exposed pictures to obtain a single picture of extended dynamic range, and improved color fidelity. Given a set of digital pictures, we may produce a single picture which is, for all practical purposes, `undig-ital', in the sense that it is a floating point image, with the kind of dynamic range we are accustomed to seeing in typical floating point representations, as opposed to the integer images from which it was generated.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if we have infinite spatial resolution, but limited dynamic range (even if we have only 1 bit of image depth), Curtis and Oppenheim <ref> [1] </ref> showed that we can also obtain perfect reconstruction. This tradeoff between image resolution, and image depth is also at work in a slightly different way in image halftoning. Before the days of digital image processing, Charles Wyck-off formulated a multiple layer photographic emulsion [2][3]. <p> A camera with a small number of bits of depth (such as a one-bit camera), but which has very high spatial resolution, may be used to capture a continuous tone image <ref> [1] </ref>. Indeed, a stat camera, used in a photo mechanical transfer (PMT) machine, is able to capture images that appear to be continuous-tone (due to the halftoning screen), even though the film can only record two distinct levels.

Reference-contexts: explosion (which appeared white since they exposed all 3 layers the details discernable primarily on account of the slow bottom layer). 2.2 Combining multiple pictures of the same scene The idea of computationally combining differently exposed pictures of the same scene to obtain extended dynamic range has been recently proposed <ref> [4] </ref>, where the images were assumed to have been taken from roughly the same position in space, with possibly different camera orientations (pan, tilt, rotation about optical axis), and different zoom settings.

Reference-contexts: The extended-response image array from the two pictures of Figs. 1 and 2 is a floating point array which has more than 256 distinct values, and therefore cannot be displayed on a conventional 8-bit display device. 6 Dynamic range; `dynamic domain' Tekalp, Ozkan, and Sezan <ref> [5] </ref>, Irani and Peleg [6], and Mann and Picard [7] have proposed methods of combining multiple pictures that are identical in exposure, but differ in camera position. The result is increased spatial resolution.

Reference-contexts: If all that is desired is a single print, why not just try to formulate a super-low-contrast film or image sensor? The superiority of the Wyckoff composite lies in the ability to control the process of going to the low contrast medium. For example, we might apply a homomorphic <ref> [8] </ref> filtering operation to the final composite, which would bring out improved details at high spatial frequencies, while reducing the unimportant overall changes in density at low spatial frequencies. 7 Wyckoff analysis and synthesis filterbanks We can regard the Wyckoff film (or exposure bracketing) as performing an analysis by decomposing the
