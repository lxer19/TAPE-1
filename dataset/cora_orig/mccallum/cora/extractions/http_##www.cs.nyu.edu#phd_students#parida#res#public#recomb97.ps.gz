Abstract: We initiate the complexity study of physical mapping with the emerging technology of Optical Mapping (OM) pioneered by the team lead by David Schwartz at the W. M. Keck Laboratory for Biomolecular Imaging, Dept of Chemistry, NYU. In currently popular electrophoretic approaches, information about the relative ordering of the fragments comprising the DNA molecule is lost, thus leading to difficult computational problems of composing the fragments in to a physical map depicting their relative order. In contrast, the relative ordering of the pieces is readily obtained in OM. However, OM faces serious technological challenges as it has low resolution and is fault-prone. We take a combinatorial approach to the problem of constructing physical maps from the erroneous data generated by OM. We identify two abstract problems in this context, namely, the Exclusive Binary Flip-Cut and Exclusive Weighted Flip-Cut problems. For both, we present polynomial time approximation schemes. However, our main contribution here is an extremely simple heuristic algorithm that rapidly and accurately (with in 3% error) constructs the physical map from input data with immense experimental errors and imprecision (even with only 10% expression of a restriction site in the molecules). Our strong experimental results, while being preliminary, seem to indicate that although OM has im mense experimental imprecision, the errors appear to be "local" and hence more easily manageable than the ones in other approaches where the errors appear "global". Also, although OM may not be suitable for producing physical maps at the resolution of few base pairs, our results indicate that it may be appropriate for rapidly generating accurate physical maps at the resolution of a few 100's of base pairs.

Reference-contexts: There are several known technological approaches to building physical maps with their associated computational problems <ref> [17, 1, 11, 13, 14, 8] </ref>; most of these use restriction enzymes. A restriction enzyme is an enzyme that recognizes a unique sequence of nucleotides and it cleaves every occurrence (called a restriction site) of that sequence in a DNA molecule. <p> combinatorial and computational problems (such as the partial digest problem, probed-partial digest problem etc.) most of which Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB),pp 209-219, Santa Fe, January 1997. are NP-hard, and many of which have been extensively studied from the point of workable heuristics (See <ref> [10, 8, 1] </ref> etc. and Section 3 of [15] for several open problems in this area). An alternative approach to physical mapping is based on a new technology pioneered by David Schwartz at the W. M. <p> We discuss three further points. First, why does our simple heuristic algorithm perform as well as it does? (In contrast, for physical mapping arising from other technological approaches, sophisticated heuristics such as Lin-Kernighan heuristic, or Hamming metric TSP were used <ref> [1] </ref>). We believe the explanation lies in the strength of the OM technique.

Reference-contexts: Finally, how far is the goal of physical mapping by OM resolved by our work? There are several other combinatorial formulations and cost functions we can envisage. Non-combinatorial approaches (eg., probabilistic, maximum likelihood) are relevant as well, and some of these are currently under investigation <ref> [2] </ref>. It remains to be seen how these formulations and solutions compare with ours. Also, OM is an evolving technology. Therefore, new technical problems arise with changes in the laboratory procedures. In this paper, we have tackled only one version for which we obtained the real data from the lab. <p> Both these indications are extremely preliminary. Thorough study embracing all the different aspects of OM simultaneously is needed. We are aware of such studies underway <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]. Finally, OM is an evolving technology. As chemical procedures change, new computational problems arise. For example, plans are underway to detect the flip of a molecule by a suitable chemical modification to the procedure in the lab.

Reference-contexts: Recently the exclusive BFC problem was proved to be NP-hard <ref> [7] </ref>, thus our polynomial approximation scheme is of interest. Are other cost functions appropriate in BFC and WFC problems? We can design PTAS algorithms for these problems with many different cost functions using the technique in Theorem 1.

In this paper, we consider the computational problem of constructing physical maps from the OM technology. For exposition in this section, consider the following idealized version of the problem.
