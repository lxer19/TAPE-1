Abstract: Asymptotic expressions for the optimal scaling factor and resulting minimum distortion, as a function of codebook size N , are found for fixed-rate k-dimensional lattice vector quantization of generalized Gaussian sources with decay parameter ff 1. These expressions are derived by minimizing upper and lower bounds to distortion. It is shown that the optimal scaling factor a N decreases as (ln N ) 1=ff N 1=k and that for scale-optimized lattice quantization, granular distortion asymptotically dominates overload distortion. Consequently, the minimum distortion is D N = c (ln N ) 2=ff N 2=k . This result indicates that the distortion of optimal lattice quantizers diverges from that of asymptotically optimal vector quantization, as N increases.

Reference-contexts: Thus we have reduced the problem of characterizing the scaling factor a N of a k-dimensional lattice quantizer to the solution of a one-dimensional integral equation. Note that (6) is similar to Equation (52) in Hui and Neuhoff <ref> [11] </ref>, which characterizes the optimal support of uniform scalar quantization for all N . The integral equation in (6) leads to the following asymptotic expression for a N . <p> Proof of Proposition 6 To prove the asymptotic expression for a N , start by defining, K (y) = y y J (y) = y (x y) p R (x) dx y x p R (x)dx which were first considered in <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> obtain ( N d ff ) K (a N N ) N = o + o N ; and take the lim inf of the resulting inequality. 2 Returning to the proof of Proposition 6, we note that R is a generalized Gamma random variable, so from Hui and Neuhoff <ref> [11] </ref>, K (y) = expfj ff y ff (1 + o N )g J (y) K (y) = expfj ff y ff (1 + o N )g: 14 Evaluating at a N N yields K (a N N ) = exp fj ff (a N N ) (1 + o N <p> 1 = o lim sup 2 y (r y)p R (r)dr R 1 R 1 = o lim sup 2J (y) = 0; where the second equality follows from L'Hopital's Rule and where the last equality follows because J (y) ! 0 as y ! 1 for generalized Gamma densities <ref> [11] </ref>. Therefore, (18) holds, which establishes the asymptotic negligibility of D o (N; a N ). Proposition 6 then follows from (16). F. <p> In order to prove (26), we will show that lim R 1 i j 2 b 2 = 1; (27) where n = N n . It can be shown that <ref> [11] </ref> Z 1 (r y) 2 p R (r) dr = c exp [j ff y ff ] (1 + o n ): The above fact, together with e b n &lt; (1 *)b n , shows that Z 1 i j 2 Z 1 i j 2 = c exp

We immediately see that D N =ffi N ! 1 as N ! 1. Although overload distortion is asymptotically negligible for scale-optimized lattice quantization, derivation of a N requires consideration of both granular and overload distortion. <p> In other words, both lattice quantization and optimal quantization have SNRs that increase as 6 dB per bit, but the difference between their SNRs increases to infinity as rate increases. As ff ! 1, the GG distribution tends uniform. For large ff, assuming Gersho's conjecture <ref> [23] </ref> and that fl and S 0 are chosen optimally, it can be shown that D N = ffi N . Thus our results are consistent with the widely-held belief that lattice quantizers are optimal for uniformly distributed sources. C.
