Abstract: This paper presents an approach to describing group behavior using simple local interactions among individuals. We propose that for a given domain a set of basic interactions can be defined which describes a large variety of group behaviors. The methodology we present allows for simplified qualitative analysis of group behavior through the use of shared goals, kin recognition, and minimal communication. We also demonstrate how these basic interactions can be simply combined into more complex compound group behaviors. To validate our approach we implemented an array of basic group behaviors in the domain of spatial interactions among homogeneous agents. We describe some of the experimental results from two distinct domains: a software environment, and a collection of 20 mobile robots. We also describe a compound behavior involving a combination of the basic interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of homogeneous groups to those of dominance hierarchies on the same set of basic behaviors.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, following and flocking are not as simply evaluated due to their dynamic nature. In this set of experiments the collection of agents was classified into a total order, based on a randomly assigned unique ID number, thus simulating an established pecking order in the group <ref> (Chase 1982, Chase & Rohwer 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It may appear necessary for agents to be able to infer each other's goals in order to locally act in such a way as to produce coherent global results. This ability requires a high computational and cognitive overhead <ref> (Gasser & N. Huhns 1989, Rosenschein & Genesereth 1985, Axelrod 1984) </ref>. However, work in both developmental psychology and ethology indicates that inferring the goals of other agents is not necessary for a large repertoire of complex interactions (Tomasello, Kruger & Rather 1992, McFarland 1987, Gould 1982, Rosen-thal & Zimmerman 1978).

Reference-contexts: Group Behavior from Basic Interactions Irrespective of the simplicity of the individuals, the global consequences of even the simplest local interactions can be arbitrarily complex. In general, is impossible to predict precisely or even qualitatively what the global-level behavior of such a system with interacting components will be <ref> (Mataric 1992, Weisbuch 1991, Wiggins 1990, Nicolis & Prigogine 1989) </ref>. Societies are by nature complex systems and as such do not lend themselves to any traditional methods of analysis. <p> By placing our experiments in physical space, we can demonstrate group behavior on simple examples of physical interactions and spatial patterns. We used the constraints imposed by the environment and the mechanics of the agents to construct a set of basic interactions we call behavior primitives <ref> (Mataric 1992) </ref> which allow for a variety of group behaviors. The next section describes our experimental methodology, environments, and results. Experimental Methodology and Results The goal or our work is to elucidate social interaction by synthesizing, observing, and analyzing phenomena similar to those observed in biology, sociology, and anthropology.
