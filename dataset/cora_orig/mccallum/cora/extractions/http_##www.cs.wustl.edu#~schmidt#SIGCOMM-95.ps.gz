Abstract: This paper will appear in the Proceedings of SIGCOMM, ACM, Abstract This paper describes research on new methods and architectures that enable the synergistic combination of IP and ATM technologies. We have designed a highly scalable gigabit IP router based on an ATM core and a set of tightly coupled general-purpose processors. This a I t P m (pronounced IP on ATM or, if you prefer, ip-attem architecture provides flexibility in congestion control, routing, resource management, and packet scheduling. The a I t P m architecture is designed to allow experimentation with, and fine tuning of, the protocols and algorithms that are expected to form the core of the next generation IP in the context of a gigabit environment. The underlying multi-CPU embedded system will ensure that there are enough CPU and memory cycles to perform all IP packet processing at gigabit rates. We believe that the a I t P m architecture will not only lead to a scalable high-performance gigabit IP router technology, but will also demonstrate that IP and ATM technologies can be mutually supportive.

Reference-contexts: The compatibility of the gigabit switch port processors and the APIC, resulting from their common use of the Utopia interface standard, makes this physical integration particularly beneficial. A similar gateway architecture, with an ATM fabric at the core for high performance and scalability, was also proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. However, [1] had argued for all per-packet processing to be implemented in hardware which is not economical, flexible and necessary, especially if the software per-packet processing can be made efficient enough to support the necessary data rates. <p> The compatibility of the gigabit switch port processors and the APIC, resulting from their common use of the Utopia interface standard, makes this physical integration particularly beneficial.

One was designed by a collaboration between MIT and Xerox PARC and is generally referred to as the CSZ algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>; the other was designed at LBL, and is named Class-Based-Queueing (CBQ) [9].

Reference-contexts: P m router integrates the following core architecture components: * A gigabit ATM switching fabric that is highly scalable in terms of the number of ports and provides optimal hardware support for multicasting [18, 19]; * A multi-CPU embedded system that includes a string of ATM Port Interconnect Controllers (APICs) <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref> and allows flex ible and high-performance IP packet processing in software. * A distributed software system capable of forwarding IP packets at gigabit data rates on the ATM substrate and configuring that substrate dynamically to provide efficient handling of IP packet streams. <p> This section discusses the various hardware subsystems and components that are used to implement the a I t P m architecture. One central component is the ATM Port Interconnect Chip (APIC). The APIC has been designed as a flexible, extensible, and high-performance ATM host interface chip <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref>. It provides direct support for segmentation and reassembly, efficient data transfer across a host processor's memory bus, support for zero-copy to and from an application's address space, and pacing of cell flows for individual virtual circuits. The APIC is designed with two bidirectional ATM interfaces.

Reference-contexts: An notable example of this style of architecture is a recent product by Net-Star <ref> [15] </ref>. The NetStar architecture comprises a central crossbar with serial interfaces operating at about 1 Gb/s per port together with interface cards containing two programmable processors and custom hardware for buffering and selected IP functions. The a t m router differs from this type of architecture in two fundamental ways.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the IPPE would explicitly process only a small part of the entire burst. 2.3 Software Run-time Environment The common path of IP packet forwarding is relatively simple and may be implemented in less than one hundred RISC instructions <ref> [16] </ref>. However, operating system (OS) related overheads of packet processing (such as data movement, interrupt processing, and context switching) are significant and may limit the overall packet throughput of a system. <p> The bulk of this processing is identical to that performed by conventional IP routers and can be optimized to about one hundred instructions per packet in the common case, as described in <ref> [16] </ref>. Each input IPPE maintains a dedicated virtual circuit to each of the output IPPEs. When queueing a packet for a particular output port, it selects the virtual circuit corresponding to an IPPE at the proper output port.

Reference-contexts: The output interfaces at the top right are similar. The bus interface at the bottom of the figure is 64 bits wide. It is designed to be directly compatible with the Sun Mbus specification <ref> [17] </ref>, but may be adapted to other memory buses with auxiliary logic. Cells arriving from either of the Utopia inputs are placed in the central cell store (its capacity is 256 cells) via the VCXT subsystem. This subsystem performs a table lookup to determine how to process a cell. <p> This architecture is the only non-blocking multicast switch architecture known that achieves optimal scaling with respect to interconnection network complexity, routing memory and virtual circuit modification. In large configurations it achieves order-of-magnitude cost improvements over competing multicast switch architectures. See <ref> [17] </ref> for further details. The architecture is implemented using a set of three custom integrated circuits. One circuit implements the Switch Elements making up the switching network.

Reference-contexts: We feel this approach will limit their ability to keep pace with future protocol enhancements and technology advances. (A good example of the kind of custom hardware solution we feel is inappropriate is described in <ref> [20] </ref>, which embeds some of the IP protocol processing in custom integrated circuits.) Our approach also differs significantly from simply implementing an IP overlay network, on top of permanent or semi-permanent virtual circuits provided by an underlying ATM network.

This standard specifies how to connect SONET transmission devices to ATM switches and host interface circuits. The output interfaces at the top right are similar.
