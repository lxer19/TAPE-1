Abstract: Sensor based planning for rod-shaped robots is necessary for the realistic deployment of noncircular symmetric robots into unknown environments. To this end, the rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG), introduced in this paper, is a roadmap for rod-like robots. A key feature of this roadmap is that it can be incrementally constructed using distance (range) information. This planning paradigm is an extension of previous work on sensor based planning for point robots.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Sensor based planning makes use of sensor information reflecting the current state of the environment, in contrast to classical planning, which assumes full knowledge of the environment prior to planning. This paper extends the sensor based planning scheme for a point robot <ref> [3] </ref> to the case of robots which can be modeled as rods. This work is the next step towards the ultimate goal of sensor based planning for an articulated multi-body chain robot. <p> To our knowledge, the only endeavors pertaining to sensor based adaptations of roadmaps for configuration space dimensions greater than two are [11] (which is based on Canny and Lin's Opportunistic Path Planner (OPP) [1]), and <ref> [3] </ref> (which is where the generalized Voronoi graph is defined). A limitation of these roadmaps is that distance measurements are assumed to be made in a configuration space (or some parameterization of it). <p> Therefore, the rod-HGVG is easier to construct using realistic sensors. This paper is an extension of a previous sensor based planning scheme which is based on the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) <ref> [3] </ref>. The GVG is the foundation for a point robot roadmap. In this paper, we term the GVG the point GVG in order to distinguish it from the generalized Voronoi graph for a rod. The point GVG was defined in terms of a distance Fig. 1. <p> fr 2 cl (SS ij ) : d i (r) d h (r) 8hg: The intersection of F ij and F jk forms a three-equidistant face, denoted F ijk , and it is the set of points equidistant to three obstacles: C i , C j , and C k <ref> [3] </ref>. In the plane, the two-equidistant faces and three- equidistant faces are one and zero-dimensional, respectively and the point GVG is the collection of these one- dimensional edges and zero-dimensional vertices. <p> In the plane, the GVG, which is the set of points equidistant to two or more obstacles, is always connected. See Figure 1. In R m , the GVG is the set of points equidistant to m obstacles and is always one-dimensional, though not necessarily connected. <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Rod Distance Function Definition 3.1 (Rod) A rod R is a line segment of length L that has two end points P and Q. The configuration space of the rod is SE (2) (SE (2) ' R 2 fiS 1 ). <p> Let the R-two-equidistant surjective surface defined by C i and C j be Since RSS ij ' SS ij fi R 1 , the dimension of RSS ij is two (recall that in R 2 , the dimension of SS ij is one <ref> [3] </ref>). RSS ij may be viewed as (but is not) a tangent bundle of SS ij . <p> The following two lemmas, whose proofs appear in the appendix, indicate that a linking strategy using the R-edges echos the linking strategy defined by the second order GVG for the point GVG in higher dimensions <ref> [3] </ref>. Lemma 6.3 The R-edges are subsets of configuration two-equidistant faces.

Reference-contexts: The rod may pass from its initial configuration to its fi-nal configuration while staying inside of the junction region defined by C i , C j , and C k . GVG edges described in <ref> [4] </ref>. Just like the point GVG edges, the rod-GVG edges are traced in an incremental manner using an adaptation of numerical continuation techniques [6] which trace the roots of the expression G (y; ) = 0 as the parameter varies where q = (y; ). <p> See Figure 11. Recall that the tangent space of a planar point GVG edge is the line orthogonal to the line segment which connects the nearest points of the two nearest obstacles which locally define the point GVG edge <ref> [4] </ref>. Let C i (r) be the closest obstacle to a point r in the plane. In this vein, let c i be the vector which connects r and the closest point to r on the closest obstacle C i (r). <p> See Figure 11. Proposition 6.1 The R-edges are one dimensional in SE (2). The proof appears in the appendix. The incremental construction technique of the R- edges is the same as the incremental construction procedure for point GVG edges (described in <ref> [4] </ref>), which is amenable to sensor based implementation. Hence, the R-edges can be constructed in an incremental fashion using only line of sight information. Definition 6.2 (Rod-HGVG) The rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG) is the collection of rod-GVG edges and R-edges.

Although this method can be readily modified with tactile sensors for sensor based use, it does not provide a roadmap of the rod robot's free space.

Reference-contexts: planning methods are limited because: (1) many are based on heuristic algorithms, and it is therefore impossible to prove if they will work in all possible environments; (2) proof of convergence for other algorithms is limited to the case of a point in two-dimensional environments (for example, Lumelsky's "bug" algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>); or (3) the robot is assumed to be a point in configuration space, where its sensors can measure distance in configuration space. The goal of this work is to develop provably correct rod motion planning schemes which can be robustly implemented with realistic sensors.
