Reference-contexts: Meta-data is cached in memory and content data is cached on disk. We discuss only one of the many issues involved in caching: the consistency of the content data. WFS borrows a cache consistency heuristic from Alex <ref> [1] </ref>: if a file appears to a client to have been last modified at time x and the current time is y, then the file contains data that was current at least (y x)=10 time ago.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is to implement WFS as a user-level network file server using the NFS protocol [4]. This implementation strategy is similar to that used in other systems that provide file-like access to systems that are not exactly file systems, e.g., Alex [1](ftp access), OdeFs <ref> [2] </ref> (access to an object-oriented database) and Semantic File System [3].
