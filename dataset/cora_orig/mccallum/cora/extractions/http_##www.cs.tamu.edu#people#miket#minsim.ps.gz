Reference-contexts: We start with the simplest arrival pattern traffic model, the Bernoulli Process. 8 CHAPTER 3. INTRODUCTION TO TRAFFIC MODELING 9 3.1 Bernoulli Processes The Stochastic Process fX n ; n = 1; 2; : : :g is called a Bernoulli Process <ref> [3] </ref> with success probability p, provided that X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : are independent, and (3.1) P fX n = 1g = p; (3.2) for all n: (3.4) The expectation of X n is given by E [X n ] = p, and the variance of X <p> Processes satisfying these conditions are Markov Chains <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, the exact model involves a multidimensional Markov chain. <p> If we let Q denote all the possible conditional, one-step transition probabilities given by (4.1), it is well known <ref> [3] </ref> that 0 = 0 Q; (4.3) To obtain the steady state distribution of the buffers lengths we have to solve linear system (4.3).

Reference-contexts: Packets destinated to an output port 18 CHAPTER 5. ANALYTICAL MIN MODEL FOR BURSTY TRAFFIC 19 output ports: DAFC will compete through a 2-to-1 multiplexor. The multistage network with this type of switchs is called Dynamically Allocated, Fully Connected (DAFC) buffer scheme, a term adopted by Ding and Bhuyan <ref> [4] </ref>. Fig. 5.1 shows an example of 2 fi 2 DAFC SE.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a traffic source on a communication network may generate constant traffic at regular time intervals, or generate long "packet-trains" corresponding, for instance, to packetized digital video or audio signal. The traffic in ATM networks is expected to be highly irregular, correlated and bursty <ref> [5] </ref>. All the processes we consider here are of discrete time, that is, the state of the system may change at discrete increments of time t 0 ; t 1 ; : : : ; t n .

Reference-contexts: Chapter 4 Analytical MIN Model for Regular Traffic In this section we develop an analysis technique proposed by Jenq <ref> [8] </ref>. This approach balances mathematical precision with numerical tractability on a model that is based on clear assumptions. Unfortunately, although the model itself is very robust, the underlying Markov chain suffers from an exponential state explosion which cannot be handled numerically even for small model sizes.

Reference-contexts: From the point of view of the design of MINs as switching fabric in switches of high-speed networks or interconnection networks for multi-computers, the most interesting traffic property is the burstiness of the sources. In one of the performance analysis for MINs under bursty traffic, <ref> [10] </ref> obtained an approximate analytical solution that was 2 orders of magnitude in error, when compared to simulation results. Another solution [12] was still unable to obtain accurate results as the burstiness 54 CHAPTER 7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 55 of the source was becoming higher.

Reference-contexts: A slot is long enough to contain one cell. An arriving slot may or may not contain a cell. Please refer to section 3.2 for a consise introduction to IBPs. CHAPTER 5. ANALYTICAL MIN MODEL FOR BURSTY TRAFFIC 20 As in <ref> [12] </ref> we will approximate the attempted departure process from an output port of each SE of the MIN behavior as IBP with appropriate parameters p, q and ff. <p> We stop as soon as the approximations fall less than a given threshold. A discussion of how to get the different p; q; ff values for each input IBP to each one of the SE can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. We note that this computational method is extremely compute and memory intensive and the process of even setting up the transition matrix Q requires special algorithms since the size of the matrix easily exceeds 10 6 fi 10 6 . <p> In one of the performance analysis for MINs under bursty traffic, [10] obtained an approximate analytical solution that was 2 orders of magnitude in error, when compared to simulation results. Another solution <ref> [12] </ref> was still unable to obtain accurate results as the burstiness 54 CHAPTER 7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 55 of the source was becoming higher.
