Title: Learning Words in Context: a Survey  
Author: Raluca Budiu 
Date: August 27, 1997  
Abstract: This paper surveys a number of theories of word meaning acquisition from context; it discusses possible (text-dependent or text-independent) constraints or biases that might help in the process, and also factors like student ability and the strength of contextual support that affect the learning task. It also reviews incidental learning from context during normal reading.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, subjects seemed to extract different properties of the context in order to attribute meaning to verbs or nouns. 4 Factors That Influence Word Learning in Context Contextual Support <ref> [Carnine et al. 1984] </ref> shows that it is easier to determine the meaning of an unknown word if it is placed in a context rather than isolated. Contextual cues that are close to the target word make the process simpler.

Reference-contexts: Also, a concept found valid for a previous context was kept subsequently if it was in some relation (causality, spatial contiguity) with another concept that was fit at present. * Fischer's study <ref> [Fischer 1994] </ref> on second language students, claims that learning words from context involves a substitution strategy (same as for definitions). Contextual information guides the substitution and overgeneralization is avoided by relating the new word to the type of contexts in which it was first met.

Reference-contexts: a passage into a coherent system consistent with his or her prior knowledge." Indeed, the authors claim that what the conceptual difficulty of a word actually measures is the degree in which the word is part of a system of concepts and the familiarity of the learner with that system. <ref> [Herman et al. 1987] </ref> is another study concerning the effects of the text properties on word learning.

Reference-contexts: Also, synonyms rather than inferential cues help students derive the word meaning. Older students seem abler to derive meanings for unknown words. 4 Another study dealing with the influence of the context on the word acquisition task is <ref> [Li 1988] </ref>, for second language learners. The author doesn't report the kind of cues he uses.

Reference-contexts: The authors explain the different use of the models by high and low verbals by hypothesizing that high verbals have a better-structured knowledge organization. They are able utilize word meaning as aggregates built of meaning components that can be acted on independently. * The study by McKeown <ref> [McKeown 1985] </ref> also offers a model for the meaning acquisition process: 1. the person recognizes the unknown word in a context and selects from the context concepts that constrain the meaning of the word 2. the person searches and tests the possible hypotheses (obtained from known concepts that fit the constraints) <p> They either transferred part of the sentence meaning to the word meaning, or interpreted a new context as the same with another one encountered previously (this error was exhibited by the adult subjects of McKeown <ref> [McKeown 1985] </ref>, too, as discussed before), or combined two local different meanings, or included parts of the sentence in the word meaning.

Reference-contexts: The author doesn't report the kind of cues he uses. However, his subjects are better at deriving and retaining word meanings in sentences that provide adequate contextual cues. <ref> [Mondria et al. 1991] </ref> deals also with the effect of the pregnancy of context on word guessing and retention for second language learners. It also asks the question how correct and incorrect guessing affects the retention (after a learning stage).

Reference-contexts: They designed an experiment that simulated normal reading conditions and they found a small, but steady (across types of text, methods of measurement and levels of scoring) amount of learning from context. <ref> [Nagy et al. 1987] </ref> analyzes the influence of word and text properties on incidental learning of word meaning in context during normal reading. The amount of learning is not very impressive in their study.

Reference-contexts: Reasoning ability seemed to have no effect on the task. However, new concepts were harder to learn by low vocabulary subjects. 5 Incidental Learning <ref> [Nagy et al. 1985] </ref> distinguishes between the ability to derive word meanings in context and the ability of incidental learning during normal reading.

Reference-contexts: described; the results show that high school and college students are sensitive to overall plausibility of definitions (with increased sensitivity for verbs rather than nouns) and that college students rely on morphological cues to decide if a word is plausible or not. * The studies conducted by Nagy and Gentner <ref> [Nagy et al. 1990a] </ref> investigate the same line of research.

Reference-contexts: The studies that we discuss try to asses the idea that implicit prior knowledge (gained by the speakers during their experience with the language) constitutes a useful bias for the learning of words in context. * <ref> [Nagy et al. 1990b] </ref> assume that a word learner is helped in his understanding of a new words by the previous experience he had with the language and with what may constitute a possible word meaning. <p> In <ref> [Nagy et al. 1990b] </ref> an experiment to test this assumption is described; the results show that high school and college students are sensitive to overall plausibility of definitions (with increased sensitivity for verbs rather than nouns) and that college students rely on morphological cues to decide if a word is plausible

Reference-contexts: In the same paper, the author finds that second language learners do not seem to benefit from the presence of both context and dictionaries, but they prefer to rely mostly on dictionaries when these two sources are present. * Sternberg and Powell <ref> [Sternberg et al. 1983] </ref> identify the context features (contextual cues) and the individual-dependent features (mediating variables) which influence word learning from context.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, words that were correctly guessed in context were not remembered more often than the words incorrectly guessed. Student Ability Shefelbine <ref> [Shefelbine 1990] </ref> shows that lower vocabulary students learn less word meanings from context, presumably because they have less available contextual information for figuring out the unknown words and because they have a less developed knowledge of known words.
