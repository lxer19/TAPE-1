Reference-contexts: Fractal dimension is not always easy to calculate. The fractal dimension of Julia sets is difficult if not impossible to compute. Excellent sources on fractals include Mandelbrot's classic book [9], Barnsley's early textbook <ref> [1] </ref>, and Peitgen's `coffee table' [13] and `how to' [14] books. 7 The GA Fractal Juliany and Vose [8] was the only paper that I was able to find that explored the relationship between fractals and genetic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The logistic equation is the canonical example used to illustrate chaotic dynamical systems. Consequently, it is a logical choice for the research. I used the genetic algorithm package, LibGA <ref> [2] </ref>, to implement a genetic algorithm for the logistic equation. The chromosome was composed of a single double-precision, floating-point value. A pool of such chromosomes was generated at random with a pool size of 100. The allele values were limited to the range [0::1].

Reference-contexts: Such unpredictable systems are chaotic dynamical systems. Researchers study simple chaotic systems hoping it will lead to a better understanding of more complex and unpredictable problems such as predicting the direction of the stock market and weather forecasting.

Reference-contexts: Offspring are generated through a process called crossover, which can be augmented by mutation. The offspring are then placed back in the pool, perhaps replacing other members of the pool. This process can be modeled using either a `generational' <ref> [6, 7] </ref> or a `steady-state' [16] genetic algorithm. The generational GA saves offspring in a temporary location until the end of a generation. At that time the offspring replace the entire current population.

Excellent sources on fractals include Mandelbrot's classic book [9], Barnsley's early textbook [1], and Peitgen's `coffee table' [13] and `how to' [14] books. 7 The GA Fractal Juliany and Vose <ref> [8] </ref> was the only paper that I was able to find that explored the relationship between fractals and genetic algorithms. The work is based on an `exact schema theorem' presented in Vose [15]. <p> The paper went on to define and describe Julia sets, the Mandelbrot set, and Fractals. A literature search revealed that little research has been done in finding a relationship between GAs and Fractals or between GAs and Chaos. Juliany and Vose <ref> [8] </ref> was the only paper that I was able to locate which investigated the relationship between fractals and GAs. They were able to find fractals, however, the fractals were located in a space that represented invalid populations for the GA.

Reference-contexts: The fractal dimension is thus D = log n since there are n pieces and the magnification factor is n. Fractal dimension is not always easy to calculate. The fractal dimension of Julia sets is difficult if not impossible to compute. Excellent sources on fractals include Mandelbrot's classic book <ref> [9] </ref>, Barnsley's early textbook [1], and Peitgen's `coffee table' [13] and `how to' [14] books. 7 The GA Fractal Juliany and Vose [8] was the only paper that I was able to find that explored the relationship between fractals and genetic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Packard [12] used a GA to evolve rules for cellular automata. He interpreted his experimental results as showing that the GA tended to select rules `at the edge of chaos'. On the other hand, Mitchell et al <ref> [11, 10] </ref> showed that Packard's model was incorrect. However, it is still an open question as to whether GAs are chaotic, or whether GAs are on the edge of chaos. <p> They were able to find fractals, however, the fractals were located in a space that represented invalid populations for the GA. The only papers that I could find investigating the relationship between chaos and GAs was Packard [12] and Mitchell et al <ref> [11, 10] </ref>. Packard used a GA to evolve rules for a cellular automata and concluded that the GA selected rules on the edge of chaos. Mitchell attacked Packard's paper and showed that his model was incorrect, leaving the question open of whether the GA can be chaotic.

Reference-contexts: However, the fact that in practice the GAs performance depends on how it is `tuned' suggests that chaos may be present. While there is an abundance of literature on chaos theory, there 14 are only a few papers dealing with chaos as it relates to GAs. Packard <ref> [12] </ref> used a GA to evolve rules for cellular automata. He interpreted his experimental results as showing that the GA tended to select rules `at the edge of chaos'.
