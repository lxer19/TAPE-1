Abstract: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm can be implemented using the group of points on an elliptic curve over the field F 2 n . A software version of this using n = 155 can be optimized to achieve computation rates that are significantly faster than non-elliptic curve versions with a similar level of security. The fast computation of reciprocals in F 2 n is the key to the highly efficient implementation described here.

Reference-contexts: We use a = 0, which eliminates one addition from the formula for the x coordinate in both operations. The size of the group depends on the choice of a and b. There is a complicated algorithm due to Schoof [28], with improvements by Atkin, Elkies, Morain, and Couveignes <ref> [9] </ref> for determining the group order. The order is always close to the number of field elements. For maximum security, the order should have as large a prime factor as possible.

Reference-contexts: The Intel 486 (66MHz) and the DEC MIPS (25MHz) are both within 10% of the SPARC times. Both machines have a 32-bit word size. 6 Other Applications The elliptic curve improvements will be helpful in implementing not only DH key exchange, but also make El Gamal style encryption <ref> [11] </ref> more attractive. The total effort of signing and checking a signature is less with elliptic curve methods than with RSA. The new reciprocal algorithm is useful for doing arithmetic in other finite fields.

The operations are presented slightly modified from their presentation in <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> If x 6= 0, then 2 (x; y) = (x 2 ; y 2 ), where x 2 = 2 + + a; y 2 = x 2 + ( + 1) x 2 ; and = x + x : <ref> [22] </ref> gives the formula for x 2 as x 2 = x 2 + b=x 2 .
