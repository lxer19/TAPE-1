Abstract: The task of choosing between lexical near-equivalents in text generation requires the kind of knowledge of fine differences between words that is typified by the usage notes of dictionaries and books of synonym discrimination. These usage notes follow a fairly standard pattern, and a study of their form and content shows the kinds of differentiae adduced in the discrimination of near-synonyms. For appropriate lexical choice in text generation and machine translation systems, it is necessary to develop the concept of formal `computational usage notes', which would be part of the lexical entries in a conceptual knowledge base. The construction of a set of `computational usage notes' adequate for text generation is a major lexicographic task of the future.

Reference-contexts: This is so for two reasons. The first is linguistic: as is well known, there is a preference in language to choose words in basic-level categories, and using a more (or less) specific word might carry an implicature that is unwanted in the particular situation <ref> (Cruse 1977, Reiter 1990) </ref>. For example, car is preferred over station wagon, though the latter is more specific, unless there is some particular reason for using the more specific word. The second reason is practical: we may be dealing with uncertain and inexact information.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this work is to develop a representation for the lexical information that computational systems need in order to perform this discrimination. Our specific interest is in representing the nuances that distinguish groups of near-synonyms, or plesionyms <ref> (Cruse 1986) </ref>. For example, lie, falsehood, untruth, fib, and misrepresentation all mean a statement that does not conform to the truth.

Reference-contexts: associated with configurations of a concept and various roles and fillers, in order to represent more finely grained semantic distinctions than those made by the concepts only: similar lexical items all map onto the same, fairly general, semantic predicate, and the associated roles and fillers represent the smaller denotational differences <ref> (for details, see Stede 1993 or DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993) </ref>. However, the strength of a purely conceptual approach is also an inherent weakness: the differences between plesionyms must be represented as differences between concepts, and this is not always easy or natural.
