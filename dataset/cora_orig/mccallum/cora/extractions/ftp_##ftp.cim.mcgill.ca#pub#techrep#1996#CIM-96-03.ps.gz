Reference-contexts: Descriptions at coarse scales relate to the gross shape features. Details at finer scales include features that are more local. The charge density distribution carries information about scale in a different way from the more common curvature-based approach <ref> [1] </ref>. This is because a strict relationship between the charge density distribution and the curvature does not exist [38]. The heuristic that the charge density on object surfaces changes monotonically with curvature seems to be quite acceptable.

Reference-contexts: The last hypothesis is then adopted as the desired object segmentation.

However, problems arise when the part shapes are not very consistent with the available model shapes.

Reference-contexts: Section 7 presents the part decomposition based on the charge density distribution. In Section 8 we report experimental results with both single- and multi-view range data. Characteristics of the charge density computation are discussed and comparisons with 1 3D PART SEGMENTATION USING SIMULATED ELECTRICAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS surface curvature <ref> [4] </ref> and particle diffusion [54] are made in Section 9. Conclusions are drawn in the last section. 2. Previous Work By a physical part, we mean a portion of the object surface which can be distinguished perceptually, geometrically or functionally from the rest of the object. <p> Briefly speaking, object segmentation into parts is a partitioning of the object surface based on surface features. Since the curvature computation involves the first and second partial derivatives of the surface, an assumption on smoothness of the object surface is mandatory <ref> [4] </ref>. Curvature computation is also very sensitive to local noise [50] and a smoothing operation on the range data is usually required. Alternatively, a larger area or scale may be employed to reduce noise effects. However, selecting a suitable scale is in general a difficult problem.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The problem of segmenting a 3D object into parts has attracted much attention in computer vision. The resolution of this problem is important for computing part-based descriptions and efficient object recognition <ref> [5, 36] </ref>. Part segmentation classifies data points on an object's surface into groups, each of which corresponds to one physical part of the object. The key issues are: (1) How to define surface features which can reliably delineate object parts; and (2) How to robustly compute these features.

Reference-contexts: Triangular Mesh Construction To compute the charge density distribution, we need to tessellate a triangular mesh on the object surface. This technique, which is called surface triangulation [18], has been used for reconstructing object shapes <ref> [6, 14, 9, 48] </ref>. A triangular mesh also specifies a data indexing system for object surfaces, which are represented by a set of discrete 3D points. Thus, triangulation establishes a specific spatial relationship between these points and facilitates the extraction of part boundaries.

Reference-contexts: The charge density is very high and very low at sharp convexities and concavities, respectively. Thus, the object part boundary can be located at local charge density minima. of the conductor <ref> [7] </ref>, as shown in Figure 2. The charge density is very high at sharp convex edges and corners. Conversely, almost no charge accumulates at sharp concavities. Electrical charge density at sharp edges and corners has been carefully studied by Jackson [24].

Reference-contexts: Each model exhibits a restricted number of non-accidental configurations 1 of surface patches in all possible views. Thus, even for all models, the number of surface configurations in all possible views is quite limited. The procedure is to first identify surface patches using region growing [22] or edge detection <ref> [8] </ref>, and then group surface patches into a potential part according to the permissible surface configurations. For "clean" image data and perfect object shapes, this approach can be efficient.

Reference-contexts: Here we briefly describe the triangular mesh construction, the details of which are given in [52]. In our experiments, surface tessellation for multiview data was done by Decarlo and Metaxas at the University of Pennsylvania using a mesh blending approach <ref> [10] </ref>. The charge density computation requires a triangular mesh to be tessellated on the complete surface of the object. However, the range data obtained from a particular view only reflect the visible surfaces, as shown in Figure 7. <p> The raw range image (sphere+cylinder.Z) originated from the PRIP Lab at Michigan State University. Its range data are shown in Figure 16 (a). The triangular mesh (see Figure 16 (b)) for the object was obtained using a mesh blending approach developed by Decarlo and Metaxas <ref> [10] </ref>. There are 480 triangles in the mesh. Figure 16 (c) gives the computed charge density distribution over the object surface. The gray levels indicate charge densities, which are normalised to the range between 0 (darkest intensity) and 250 (white).

Reference-contexts: Shape-based approaches decompose objects into parts by measuring the shape similarity between image data and an arrangement of predefined part models. For example, spheres have been used as models for object shape decomposition. The resultant object descriptions are represented in terms of either overlapping <ref> [34, 11] </ref> or non-overlapping [29] spheres. Since a sphere is orientation-invariant, the object descriptions tend to be very simple. However, this kind of description is not unique because different arrangements of spheres can represent the same shape.

Motivation According to Hoffman and Richards [21], the mental concept of a part is based upon a particular regularity in nature - transversality <ref> [19] </ref>. This theory states that when two arbitrarily shaped surfaces are made to interpenetrate, they always meet at a contour of concave discontinuity of their tangent planes, as shown in Figure 1. Here surfaces of two ellipsoids meet at a contour of concave discontinuity of the tangent planes. <p> Discussions We have introduced a novel approach to part segmentation using simulated charge density distributions. The major difference of this approach from other boundary-based approaches is the algorithm for surface characterisation. By employing a physical analogy to the well known transversality principle <ref> [19] </ref>, our algorithm has some interesting properties and certain advantages over previous boundary-based approaches. These are elaborated in the following: Uniqueness: It has been proven that the charge density distribution on a charged conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is uniquely determined [45].

Reference-contexts: It is a well-known physical fact that electrical charge on the surface of a conductor tends to accumulate at a sharp convexity and vanish at a sharp concavity. Thus object part boundaries, which are usually denoted by a sharp surface concavity <ref> [21] </ref>, can be detected by locating surface points exhibiting local charge density minima. Beginning with range data of a 3D object, we tessellate the object surface with a closed triangular mesh and simulate the charge density distribution over the surface. <p> Conclusions are drawn in the last section. 2. Previous Work By a physical part, we mean a portion of the object surface which can be distinguished perceptually, geometrically or functionally from the rest of the object. Definitions of parts are discussed in <ref> [25, 21, 28, 43] </ref>. Part segmentation algorithms can be categorised as being shape- or boundary-based. Shape-based approaches decompose objects into parts by measuring the shape similarity between image data and an arrangement of predefined part models. For example, spheres have been used as models for object shape decomposition. <p> Rom and Medioni [40] have performed part decomposition based on this theory using range data as input. The problem with this scheme is that parabolic lines cannot indicate part boundaries on cylindrical surfaces <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The charge density is very high at sharp convex edges and corners. Conversely, almost no charge accumulates at sharp concavities. Electrical charge density at sharp edges and corners has been carefully studied by Jackson <ref> [24] </ref>. An object edge or corner is defined as a C 1 discontinuity of an object surface. By ignoring secondary global effects, Jackson has derived an approximate relationship governing the charge density at an edge formed by two conducting planes, as shown in Figure 3. <p> It has been shown <ref> [24] </ref> that the larger fi and the smaller , the greater the charge density at P . For a constant , the charge density increases monotonically as fi increases. A theoretical singular behaviour of charge densities at edges (for = 0) has been also revealed as follows [24]: = &gt; &gt; <p> has been shown <ref> [24] </ref> that the larger fi and the smaller , the greater the charge density at P . For a constant , the charge density increases monotonically as fi increases. A theoretical singular behaviour of charge densities at edges (for = 0) has been also revealed as follows [24]: = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 1 if fi &gt; constant if fi = 0 if fi &lt; This means that the charge density is infinite, constant and zero when the angle defined by the two planes is convex, flat and concave, respectively. <p> The singular behaviour of charge densities at corners, which is similar to that at edges, has also been investigated <ref> [24] </ref>. We have observed that at slightly smoothed edges and corners, the positions of local extrema of charge densities are not changed. <p> This is because a strict relationship between the charge density distribution and the curvature does not exist [38]. The heuristic that the charge density on object surfaces changes monotonically with curvature seems to be quite acceptable. However, we note that Jackson's theoretical result <ref> [24] </ref> (see Section 3) holds only locally at a surface with C 1 discontinuity. But the surface at part boundaries may be C 1 continuous or smooth. Curvature is completely determined by local data. But the charge density distribution is affected by all of the points on the object surface.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The problem of segmenting a 3D object into parts has attracted much attention in computer vision. The resolution of this problem is important for computing part-based descriptions and efficient object recognition <ref> [5, 36] </ref>. Part segmentation classifies data points on an object's surface into groups, each of which corresponds to one physical part of the object. The key issues are: (1) How to define surface features which can reliably delineate object parts; and (2) How to robustly compute these features. <p> Since a sphere is orientation-invariant, the object descriptions tend to be very simple. However, this kind of description is not unique because different arrangements of spheres can represent the same shape. More complex shape models, such as quadrics and superellipsoids, have also been used for part segmentation <ref> [36, 35, 20, 23, 46] </ref>. These approaches first hypothesise an object configuration composed of part models, assuming that the shape of each part is very similar to that of a particular model. Secondly, they evaluate a measure of the similarity between the hypothesis and the true object shape.

Because of this, our approach involves many fewer unknown variables than voxel-based approaches <ref> [47, 37, 54] </ref>. 4. Charge Density Computation Our physical model is the charge density distribution on a charged conductor in 3D free space, where there no other charges or conductors exist.

Reference-contexts: Details at finer scales include features that are more local. The charge density distribution carries information about scale in a different way from the more common curvature-based approach [1]. This is because a strict relationship between the charge density distribution and the curvature does not exist <ref> [38] </ref>. The heuristic that the charge density on object surfaces changes monotonically with curvature seems to be quite acceptable. However, we note that Jackson's theoretical result [24] (see Section 3) holds only locally at a surface with C 1 discontinuity.

A triangular mesh also specifies a data indexing system for object surfaces, which are represented by a set of discrete 3D points. Thus, triangulation establishes a specific spatial relationship between these points and facilitates the extraction of part boundaries.

Reference-contexts: Since the curvature computation involves the first and second partial derivatives of the surface, an assumption on smoothness of the object surface is mandatory [4]. Curvature computation is also very sensitive to local noise <ref> [50] </ref> and a smoothing operation on the range data is usually required. Alternatively, a larger area or scale may be employed to reduce noise effects. However, selecting a suitable scale is in general a difficult problem. Also, a larger scale will increase the computational time. <p> Instead, their influence is weighted by the reciprocal of the distance between the observation and source points (see Equation (6)). Thus, a charge density computation possesses both "quasi-global" and "quasi-local" properties. The "quasi-global" property helps reduce noise effects. It has been shown that curvature-based approaches are unreliable <ref> [50] </ref> with respect to inherent noise in input data. However, since the charge density computation uses weighted global shape information, it reduces the sensitivity to sensor noise and produces 27 3D PART SEGMENTATION USING SIMULATED ELECTRICAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS a more robust result, as shown in Figure 13.

Reference-contexts: Multiview data are obtained by merging range data acquired in a few viewpoints. They are a sequence of 3D data points and their whose spatial relationship is not specified. Here we briefly describe the triangular mesh construction, the details of which are given in <ref> [52] </ref>. In our experiments, surface tessellation for multiview data was done by Decarlo and Metaxas at the University of Pennsylvania using a mesh blending approach [10]. The charge density computation requires a triangular mesh to be tessellated on the complete surface of the object. <p> The second 3D object is a toy bowling pin. The range data (see Figure 17 (a)) were obtained by multiview integration, as described in <ref> [52] </ref>. The triangular mesh of the object in Figure 17 (b) was computed in the same way as the previous object. There are 864 triangles in the mesh. Figure 17 (c) shows the simulated charge density distribution. Again the charge density distribution clearly indicates the local charge density minima.

Reference-contexts: In Section 8 we report experimental results with both single- and multi-view range data. Characteristics of the charge density computation are discussed and comparisons with 1 3D PART SEGMENTATION USING SIMULATED ELECTRICAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS surface curvature [4] and particle diffusion <ref> [54] </ref> are made in Section 9. Conclusions are drawn in the last section. 2. Previous Work By a physical part, we mean a portion of the object surface which can be distinguished perceptually, geometrically or functionally from the rest of the object. <p> Thus, one does not require a voxel-based coordinate system or need to compute the object interior. Because of this, our approach involves many fewer unknown variables than voxel-based approaches <ref> [47, 37, 54] </ref>. 4. Charge Density Computation Our physical model is the charge density distribution on a charged conductor in 3D free space, where there no other charges or conductors exist. <p> In other words, the artificially constructed mesh on the invisible surface does not seem to affect the charge density extrema on the visible surface. A similar strategy has been proposed for generating a closed surface in 3D space for diffusion-based shape analysis <ref> [54] </ref>. 15 3D PART SEGMENTATION USING SIMULATED ELECTRICAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS (a) (b) (c) is normalised between gray levels 0 and 255. The brightest and darkest intensities indicate the highest and lowest charge densities, respectively. <p> The charge density approach is not able to do this since it assumes the existence of a multi-part object. 28 3D PART SEGMENTATION USING SIMULATED ELECTRICAL CHARGE DISTRIBUTIONS An alternate strategy for obtaining surface features is isotropic diffusion <ref> [54] </ref>. Working in 3D Euclidean space, this approach simulates the propagation of a specific number of particles among object voxels. At a certain intermediate stage of the diffusion process, particle accumulations at sharp surface concavities and convexities become significant. Thus diffusion must be stopped before reaching the equilibrium state.
