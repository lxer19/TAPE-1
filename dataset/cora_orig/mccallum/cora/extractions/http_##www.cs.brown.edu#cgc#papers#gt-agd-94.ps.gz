Abstract: Graph drawing addresses the problem of constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks. It is an emerging area of research that combines flavors of topological graph theory and computational geometry. The automatic generation of drawings of graphs has important applications in key computer technologies such as software engineering, database design, visual interfaces, and computer-aided-design. This paper surveys recent results of the authors on graph drawing and overviews various research trends in the area.

Reference-contexts: Tamassia and Tollis [51] and Wismath [54] characterize the class of graphs that admit an *-1-visibility representation, and provide a linear-time algorithm for testing membership in this class. Tamassia and Tollis [51] also show that every 4-connected planar graph has a strong 1-visibility representation. However, Andreae <ref> [1] </ref> proves that deciding whether a graph admits a 1-strong visibility representation is NP-complete. Algorithms for constructing in O (n) time an O (n 2 )-area weak 1-visibility representation of an n-vertex planar graph are given by Tamassia and Tollis [51] and by Rosenstiehl and Tarjan [47].

Reference-contexts: Concerning single-source digraphs, Thomassen [52] characterizes upward planarity in terms of forbidden circuits. Hutton and Lubiw [31] combine Thomassen's characterization with a decomposition scheme to test upward planarity of an n-vertex single-source digraph in O (n 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: While planarity testing can be done in linear time <ref> [30, 40, 6, 16] </ref>, the complexity of upward planarity testing has been until very recently an open problem. Combinatorial results on upward planarity of covering digraphs of lattices were first given in [37, 44]. The interplay between upward planarity and ordered sets is surveyed in [46].

Reference-contexts: The above area bounds are asymptotically optimal in the worst case. Other interesting trade-offs arise if we relax the upwardness requirement. As shown in [39, 53], a binary tree with n vertices admits an O (n)-area planar orthogonal grid drawing. However, Brent and Kung <ref> [7] </ref> show that if the leaves of a complete binary tree with n vertices are constrained to be on the convex hull of the drawing, then the drawing needs (n log n) area. 3.3 Angular Resolution Formann, Hagerup, Haralambides, Kaufmann, Leighton, Simvonis, Welzl, and Woeg-inger [26] study the angular resolution of

Reference-contexts: Also, it is important that the dynamic drawing algorithm does not alter drastically the structure of the drawing after a local modification of the graph. In fact, human interaction requires a "smooth" evolution of the drawing. Cohen, Di Battista, Tamassia, Tollis, and Bertolazzi <ref> [9] </ref> present dynamic algorithms for drawing planar graphs under a variety of drawing standards. They consider straight-line, polyline, grid, upward, and visibility drawings together with aesthetic criteria that are important for readability, such as the display of planarity, symmetry, and reachability.

Reference-contexts: The drawing can be constructed in O (n) time. Also, the above area bound is asymptotically optimal in the worst case. Previously, Crescenzi, Di Battista, and Piperno <ref> [10] </ref> considered strictly upward grid drawings, where the vertices have integer coordinates, and the parent of a vertex has y-coordinate strictly greater than the ones of its children.

Reference-contexts: Hence, trade-offs are inherent in graph drawing. Several interesting tradeoffs have been recently discovered relating important properties of drawings, such as area, angular resolution, number of crossings, number of bends, and upwardness (for digraphs). 3.1 Upward Planar Drawings of Digraphs Di Battista, Tamassia, and Tollis <ref> [23] </ref> study the problem of constructing upward planar polyline drawings with the the objective of achieving small area and small number of bends.

Reference-contexts: While planarity testing can be done in linear time [30, 40, 6, 16], the complexity of upward planarity testing has been until very recently an open problem. Combinatorial results on upward planarity of covering digraphs of lattices were first given in <ref> [37, 44] </ref>. The interplay between upward planarity and ordered sets is surveyed in [46]. Lempel, Even, and Cederbaum [40] relate the planarity of bicon-nected undirected graphs to the upward planarity of st-digraphs.

Reference-contexts: In 2-visibility representations of graphs the vertices are represented by disjoint isothetic rectangles in the plane, and adjacent vertices are associated with rectangles that are visible in the vertical or horizontal direction. As for the 1-visibility case, we distinguish weak, strong, and *-2-visibility representations. Kirkpatrick and Wismath <ref> [38] </ref> prove that every planar graph admits an *-2-visibility representation. Kant, Liotta, Tamassia, and Tollis [35] study the area requirement of 1- and 2-visibility representations of trees. Their results show how the area requirement varies with the specific type of visibility representation.

Reference-contexts: The algorithmic approach is computationally efficient, however, it does not naturally support constraints, i.e., requirements that the user may want to impose on the drawing of a specific graph (e.g., clustering or aligning a given set of vertices). Previous work by Tamassia et al. <ref> [50] </ref> has shown the importance of satisfying constraints in graph drawing systems, and has demonstrated that a limited constraint satisfaction capability can be added to an existing drawing algorithm.

Hutton and Lubiw [31] combine Thomassen's characterization with a decomposition scheme to test upward planarity of an n-vertex single-source digraph in O (n 2 ) time.
