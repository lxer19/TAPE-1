Abstract: In these lectures general relativity is outlined as the classical field theory of gravity, emphasizing physical phenomena rather than formalism. Dynamical solutions representing traveling waves as well as stationary fields like those of black holes are discussed. Their properties are investigated by studying the geodesic structure of the corresponding space-times, as representing the motion of point-like test particles. The interaction between gravitational, electro-magnetic and scalar fields is also considered. c fl

Reference-contexts: The observation of an excess in the precession of the perihelion of the orbit of Mercury around the sun by LeVerrier in 1845, and improved by Newcomb in 1882 <ref> [1] </ref>, was one of the first clear indications that this is actually not the case, and that the gravitational force is more complicated. The exact form of the gravitational forces exerted by moving bodies is a problem with many similarities to the analogous problem in electrodynamics.

Reference-contexts: Maxwell's predictions were magnificently verified in the experiments of Hertz, confirming the reality and characteristics of electromagnetic waves <ref> [2] </ref>. From these results it became clear, for 3 example, that light is just a special variety of such waves. Therefore optical and electromagnetic phenomena have a common origin and can be described in a single theoretical framework.

Reference-contexts: As in electrodynamics, also in gravity the concept of field has taken a central place. What Maxwell achieved for electromagnetism, was accomplished by Einstein in the case of gravity <ref> [3] </ref>: to obtain a complete description of the forces in terms of space- and time-dependent fields. This field theory is known as the general theory of relativity.

Reference-contexts: They illustrate many interesting aspects of gravitational physics. 3.2 Plane fronted waves To show that in four dimensions non-trivial gravitational fields can indeed propagate through empty space-time, we now consider a class of solutions known in the literature as plane-fronted gravitational waves <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. This name derives from the property that there is a co-ordinate system in which these field configurations (i) move with the speed of light along a straight line; (ii) have a flat planar wave front, and (iii) are of finite duration.

Finally we address the algebraic properties of the constants of geodesic flow. We have already remarked, that the Poisson brackets of two such constants yields another constant by the Jacobi identity (2.51).

Reference-contexts: It makes clear how one can derive the lagrangian and hamiltonian actions presented above within a unified framework. The key to the general formulation is to incorporate reparametrization invariance in an action of the type (2.35) <ref> [21] </ref>. This is achieved by introduction of a new variable e (), a function of the affine parameter, which acts as a gauge field in one dimension for local reparametrizations of the worldline.

Reference-contexts: This implies that once higher-order invariants appear, one may expect an infinite series of them. Sometimes this happens indeed, as with the Virasoro algebra for the conformal transformation in two dimensions <ref> [22] </ref>. However, in many cases the series stops because the higher order invariants are Casimir-type of operators, or they become trivial in that they are just products of commuting lower-order elements (commuting here is meant in the sense of vanishing Poisson brackets).

Reference-contexts: In two or three dimensions, these fields carry at best a finite number of physical degrees of freedom, related to the sources and/or the topology <ref> [23] </ref>. In four or higher-dimensional space-time the gravitational field is a fully dynamical system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. In particular, dynamical gravitational fields can exist in the absence of material sources, in empty space-time.

Reference-contexts: In fact we will demonstate an even closer analogy in the case of scalar fields in the next section. With the conventional energy-momentum tensor for the electro-magnetic field, the Einstein-Maxwell equations describing the coupling between gravity and electro-magnetism read <ref> [24] </ref> R - = c 2 F F 1 g - F 2 ; (3.69) D F - = 0: (3.70) Because the energy-momentum tensor of the electro-magnetic field is traceless, the first equation implies that the scalar curvature vanishes, R = 0.

Thus the general solution of Einstein's equations is seen to be a superposition of a special gravitational wave, generated by the energy-momentum of the electro-magnetic field, and an arbitrary free planar gravitational wave traveling in the same direction.

Reference-contexts: One can even show that in some models these two forms of spontaneous symmetry breaking |of a scalar field and of the gravitational field| are connected <ref> [27] </ref>. Therefore we find a new interpretation for the planar gravitational waves: they act as domain boundaries separating different, inequivalent flat-space solutions (`vacua') of the Einstein equations. <p> As pointed out in the introductory remarks, this phenomenon as well as a similar one for the gravitational effect of a scalar field with constant gradient <ref> [27, 28] </ref>, recall the Josephson effect in superconductivity.

For the present application it is convenient to proceed as follows. <p> In this section we take up this aspect of the the field theory and show, that dynamical domain boundaries in scalar field theories (scalar-type shock waves, if one prefers) are also sources of planar gravitational waves of the kind analysed in detail above <ref> [27] </ref>. This is another instance of the general observation that almost any type of dynamical situation with time-dependent mass-energy distributions is accompanied by gravitational fields.

Using a semi-classical approximation, it was shown by Hawking <ref> [45] </ref>, that quantum fluctuations near the horizon of a black hole indeed lead to the emission of particles with a thermal spectrum. This is true irrespective of the existence of an ergosphere, therefore it covers the case of vanishing angular momentum as well.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately this is compensated by the 79 appearance of a new constant of motion, quadratic in momenta, which replaces the Casimir invariant of total angular momentum <ref> [46, 47] </ref>. As a result one can still completely solve the geodesic equations in terms of first integrals of motion. We now give some details.

Reference-contexts: This provides a means of extracting energy from a spinning black hole, as first proposed by Penrose <ref> [48] </ref>: if a particle enters the ergosphere with energy ", this becomes a momentum; during its stay in the ergosphere the momentum can be changed, for example by a decay of the particle into two or more fragments, in such a way that the final momentum of one of the fragments
