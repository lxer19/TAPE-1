Abstract: Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) of the future will feature Free Flight, in which aircraft choose their own routes, altitude, and speed, and automated conflict resolution methods in which aircraft will coordinate to resolve conflicts. The resulting distributed control architecture is a hybrid system, with mixed discrete event and continuous time dynamics. SmartATMS is an object oriented modeling and simulation facility which accounts for these hybrid issues and will serve as a uniform modeling framework for the design and evaluation of various ATMS concepts.

Reference-contexts: There are essentially two simulation facilities for hybrid systems: SHIFT (Deshpande et al. 1996), developed by the PATH project at U.C. Berkeley, and OMOLA/OMSIM <ref> (Andersson 1994,1995) </ref> developed at Lund University, Sweden. SHIFT, in addition to simulating hybrid systems, allows the modeling of layered control architectures, coordination of distributed control agents and object oriented simulation. Smar-tATMS is being developed using SHIFT and thus inherits all of its advantages.

Reference-contexts: The object oriented structure of SHIFT allows SmartATMS users to create their own future ATMS by composing objects from available libraries, and to compare it with the current system or other future alternatives. Similar research efforts have been done in the Automated Highway Systems domain <ref> (Deshpande et al. 1995) </ref> . The organization of this paper is as follows.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 discusses issues for further research. 2 NEXT GENERATION ATMS In this section we briefly describe a decentralized architecture for Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) which has been proposed in <ref> (Sastry et al. 1995) </ref>,(Tomlin 1997). Each airport resides within a Terminal Radar Approach and Control (TRACON) region whose size is typically 50 nautical miles in radius and 11,000 feet in altitude. Due to the heavy congestion within TRACONs, aircraft will travel along predetermined, optimal approach and departure routes.
