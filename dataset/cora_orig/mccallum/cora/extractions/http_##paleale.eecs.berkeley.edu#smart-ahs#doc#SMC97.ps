Title: Microsimulation Analysis of a Hybrid System Model of Multiple Merge Junction Highways and Semi-Automated Vehicles  
Author: Marco Antoniottiz Akash Deshpandez Alain Giraultx 
Affiliation: UC Berkeley and California PATH INRIA Rhone-Alpes, France, Bip project  
Abstract: In this paper we present a protocol that controls semi-automated autonomous vehicles driving on an multiple merge junction highway. The protocol is distributed and controls both the merging (the vehicle is in the merge lane) and the yielding (the vehicle is in the main lane). We show a simulation study that presents the protocol and what impacts it has on safety and congestion under different conditions.

Reference-contexts: Hence several metropolitan transportation agencies are turning towards higher levels of automation technologies to address these problems. Different automation strategies have been proposed <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. They are classified according to their distribution of intelligence and cooperation attributes. In this paper, we address the case where all automation intelligence is concentrated within individual vehicles|leading to the so called autonomous scenario, where there is no communication among vehicles and between vehicles and the infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: We model a 10 km highway section, which includes three merge junction and three exit ramps. We show through micro-simulation the performance of the protocol. The entire application is programmed within the SMART AHS framework 1 <ref> [2] </ref>, which is in turn built upon the Shift programming language [3]. Shift is a simulation language for Hybrid Systems. makes the simulation extremely flexible modular.
