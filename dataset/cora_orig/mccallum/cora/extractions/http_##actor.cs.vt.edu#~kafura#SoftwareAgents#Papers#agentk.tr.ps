Abstract: This report describes a synthesis of two well-known agent paradigms: Agent-Oriented Programming, Shoham (1990), and the Knowledge Query & Manipulation Language, Finin (1993). The initial implementation of AOP, Agent-0, is a simple language for specifying agent behaviour. KQML provides a standard language for inter-agent communication. Our integration (which we have called Agent-K) demonstrates that Agent-0 and KQML are highly compatible. Agent-K provides the possibility of inter-operable (or open) software agents, that can communicate via KQML and which are programmed using the AOP approach.
