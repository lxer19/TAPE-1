Reference-contexts: Vector entities include points, lines, and polygons, all of which are representations of the space occupied by real-world entities. Raster data is characterized as an array of points, where each point represents the value of an attribute for a real-world area. Baumann <ref> [1] </ref> gives a more thorough description of various raster image types. Topology: Some geographic entities have topological properties which are unaltered by elastic deformations. Examples include the connectedness of a region and the connectivity between road intersections via road segments.

Reference-contexts: Layer algebra [6] provides a field-based view. It defines a set of operations which can manipulate different layers to produce new layers. The object-based model treats the world as a surface littered with recognizable objects, which exist independent of their locations (e.g. cities, mountains, rivers). GeO 2 <ref> [2] </ref>, GraphDB [11], GODOT [9], Worboy [22], OGIS [7] and GeoOOA [13] are some attempts to model GISs using the object-based approach. GeO 2 provides a library of spatial types (e.g. point, line, chain) and operations on these types (e.g. intersect, overlap).

Reference-contexts: If such data is used in an analysis, the results of the analysis would need to be interpreted within the error tolerance of the data. Thus, accurate representation of data is critical for the proper use of geographic data in decision making <ref> [3] </ref>. Discretizing Continuous Space: Geographic phenomena occupy continuous space. However, computers and digital databases can only store and manipulate their discrete approximations. The process of discretization raises the issue of interpolation, which estimates the values at various points to generate a cartographic presentation. Triangulation-based discretization allows simple interpolation.

Reference-contexts: The scatter-glyph plot is a visual representation of two discrete features (e.g. accident severity, month of the year). 4 Case Study 4.1 An Example GIS Application Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of highway travel <ref> [5] </ref>. Major data sources and users in ITS are shown in Figure 4. Three sources of data are pictured. First, sensors on the highways produce measurements of traffic flow at regular intervals. The road and highway maps represent a second source of data.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon is called map-generalization. 1 1.2 Related work and contribution The GIS data models can be categorized into field-based models and object-based models. Field-based models see the world as a continuous surface (layer) over which features vary (e.g. elevation). Layer algebra <ref> [6] </ref> provides a field-based view. It defines a set of operations which can manipulate different layers to produce new layers. The object-based model treats the world as a surface littered with recognizable objects, which exist independent of their locations (e.g. cities, mountains, rivers).

OGIS provides a set of geometric classes to facilitate data exchange across different GISs. <p> Additional entities represent the primitives such as points, lines, polygons, etc. as proposed in related models <ref> [7, 20] </ref>. Topology: Topology is a property belonging to a spatial object and that property remains unaltered even when the object deforms. An example is a road network. The two nodes in the network thus remain connected even if the path between the nodes is changed by road construction.

Reference-contexts: Measurements from magnetic loop detectors and cameras represent different coverages. Even the transportation network space is discretized by lanes across its width and by road segments across its length. Traffic measurements at adjacent detectors can also be interpolated over space and time using the traffic flow theory <ref> [8] </ref>. Data Model: The highways are often represented in more than one format, since different users of the data have different requirements. One class of users requires that the lane segments, interchanges, and ramps be represented as polygons. These users include construction engineers and researchers using driving simulators.

Reference-contexts: A network overlay enables the integration of disparate network-attribute databases, which join two or more sets of attributes. Path Optimization models several problems, including shortest path analysis, optimum tour routing, etc. Queries in GISs use spatial relationships within the query predicates. Spatial relationships can be distinguished into 3 categories <ref> [10] </ref>: 4 * Topological relationships: These include connected, adjacent, inside, and disjoint.

Examples include the connectedness of a region and the connectivity between road intersections via road segments. Primitives are required for representing networks, graphs and partitions as high-level entities <ref> [11] </ref>. Partitions are related to networks in that they associate regions with other regions by relationships such as next, adjacent, etc. Networks and partitions can be decomposed into points, lines and regions for modeling; however, that complicates behavioral modeling (e.g. an operation such as the shortest-path computation) and manipulation.

Reference-contexts: Vehicles contain graphic display devices that display road maps and current congestions. Traffic controllers at a Traffic Management Center (TMC) may use the data. Also, researchers will often use the data from an ITS for driving simulation to study traffic management and human safety issues <ref> [12] </ref>. 4.2 The GISER Model of the application and relationships (e.g. discretized by, displays). It is based on four major concepts: transportation network space, traffic, loop-detector dataset and spatial objects. Transportation network space is a subset of geographic space consisting of freeways, highways and roads.

Reference-contexts: The measurements therefore need validation. Various integrity constraints including topological constraints also need to be checked. An example of a topological constraint is "Minneapolis should be inside Minnesota". Data Model: A conceptual data model <ref> [14] </ref> is a type of data abstraction that hides the details of data-storage. It uses logical concepts which may be easier for most users to understand. It supports data input, manipulation and result presentation. Many GISs are organized as a collection of themes. <p> It uses the Enhanced Entity Relationship <ref> [14] </ref> 1 diagram notation described in figure 2, along with dashed lines for continuous fields and relationships. The GISER model is based on 4 major concepts: Space/Time, Features, Coverages and Spatial Objects.

Reference-contexts: Operations on primitive vector data-types include geometric operations (e.g. area or boundary, intersection), topological operations (e.g. connectedness) and metric operations (e.g. distance). For example, a GIS containing the Minneapolis road network may have to compute a path between two locations which does not pass via downtown's congested streets <ref> [17] </ref>. Result Presentation Facilities: Unlike the typical text-based output supported by most databases, a GIS presents results visually (e.g. cartographically) in the form of maps.

Reference-contexts: The partitions and fragments of space within each theme are often stored within the database and can be treated as entities or objects. Data Manipulation Capabilities: Geographic data is queried and analyzed for various operations. Some of the queries on geographic data involve spatial searches and overlays <ref> [18] </ref>. Operations on primitive vector data-types include geometric operations (e.g. area or boundary, intersection), topological operations (e.g. connectedness) and metric operations (e.g. distance). For example, a GIS containing the Minneapolis road network may have to compute a path between two locations which does not pass via downtown's congested streets [17].

Reference-contexts: GraphDB supports the explicit modeling and querying of graphs. GeoOOA uses classical object-oriented analysis for geographical applications. It adds a geographic dimension to each object-modeling and spatial entity, and it supports a fixed set of geometric types and topological relationships. The GERM <ref> [19] </ref> model attempts to unify the two approaches and provides a set of concepts as an add-on to the ER model for modeling GISs. These models do not explicitly support the discretization process, which consists of interpolation to invert the discretization and processing of raw sensor data. <p> Triangulation-based discretization allows simple interpolation. Discretization could either be uniform, i.e. independent of the spatial entity that it is modeling (e.g. laying a rectangular grid over a continuous 2-dimensional domain), or it could be dependent on it (e.g. a thematic layer <ref> [19] </ref>). A layer is a mapping from a domain of non-overlapping geometric regions to a domain of attribute values. In a simple case, a thematic layer consists of a set of polygons, with each polygon being an area of constant value for an attribute. Thematic polygons are weak entities.

Reference-contexts: It is more natural to use a direct construct for networks, partitions, etc. Additional discussion of topology in GISs can be found in the Worboy model <ref> [21, 20] </ref>. 2.3 Data Manipulation Capabilities Queries in GISs often involve set operations on the geometric and topological properties of spatial entities.

These relationships include topological relationships, direction relationships and metric relationships, as described in section 2.3. These relationships serve as spatial predicates for queries in GIS.
