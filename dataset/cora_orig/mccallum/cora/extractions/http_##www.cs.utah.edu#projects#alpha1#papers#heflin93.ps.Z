Abstract: In this paper, an approach is presented that allows one to compute shadow volumes directly from free form models and exploit them for the generation of shadows using a Z-buffer based renderer. A polygonal approximation is not required for either the construction of the shadow volume or for the rendering process.

Reference-contexts: A model is considered closed if it dichotomizes the Euclidean space into regions that are inside and outside the model, and is considered open otherwise. For example, models used in our implementation were developed within the Alpha 1 geometric modeling environment <ref> [ EGS 1992 ] </ref> and consist of a set of, possibly trimmed, NURBs surfaces with surface adjacency information stored explicitly as the edges that are shared between two neighboring surfaces. The addition of shadows to rendered images provides critical cues in determining relative positioning of models within a scene. <p> The resulting trimmed shadowed and unshadowed regions are desirable if accessibility and visibility is to be explicitly solved. 6 Examples The included rendered examples were produced by incorporating the above techniques into an existing scan line renderer in the Alpha 1 modeling system <ref> [ EGS 1992 ] </ref> . The color images show shadow renderings of several free form surface models. The corresponding shadow surfaces for the top left image of the floating torus and sphere (Fig. 6) are shown below it (Fig. 8).

Reference-contexts: The techniques can be categorized into the following six categories. 1. Scan-line shadow generation. Comparison is done between all models to determine pairs that can interact to produce shadows <ref> [ Appel 1968, Bouknight 1970, Nishita 1991 ] </ref> . These precomputed relations are used to produce shadows during scan line rendering. 2. Two-pass model-precision approach. Models are divided into visible and hidden polygonal regions as viewed from the light source [ Atherton 1978 ] .

Reference-contexts: These precomputed relations are used to produce shadows during scan line rendering. 2. Two-pass model-precision approach. Models are divided into visible and hidden polygonal regions as viewed from the light source <ref> [ Atherton 1978 ] </ref> . All the shadowed regions are tagged once and can then be rendered from any desired viewpoint. 3. Shadow volume approach. Volumes are generated that enclose shadowed regions of space [ Berg-eron 1986, Chin 1989, Crow 1977, Fuchs 1985, Max 1986, Nishita 1987 ] . <p> When calculating shading information for a surface, those light sources with a negative occlusion counter are not included in the calculations. An alternate approach, that corresponds to the two pass model precision approach to shadow generation <ref> [ Atherton 1978 ] </ref> , represents shadows as trimmed regions of the model through a preprocess. The shadow volumes are intersected with models in the scene to trim the model into shadowed and unshadowed regions.

The boundary surfaces of the shadow volumes are also processed by the Z buffer scan line renderer. Shadow surfaces in the z-list <ref> [ Atherton 1981 ] </ref> in front of a visible surface are examined to determine if the visible surface is also in shadow. This is a common approach to shadow rendering. <p> The first technique follows the common scan line approach [ Crow 1977 ] . The shadow surfaces are added to the free form surface database before scan line rendering. These surfaces are not treated as renderable data but are added only to provide shadowing information. Traversing the z-list <ref> [ Atherton 1981 ] </ref> , L, of surfaces at a given pixel of the Z-buffer, we examine the normals of the shadow surfaces that we encounter.

The techniques can be categorized into the following six categories. 1. Scan-line shadow generation. Comparison is done between all models to determine pairs that can interact to produce shadows [ Appel 1968, Bouknight 1970, Nishita 1991 ] . <p> The notion of shadow surfaces can be introduced that parallels the use of shadow polygons in the polygonal shadow volume approach. Using this notion, a shadow surface is cast from each extracted contour, without the need to combine the contours into closed loops. As discussed elsewhere <ref> [ Bergeron 1986 ] </ref> , silhouettes and boundaries produce different occlusion effects. That is, shadow surfaces corresponding to silhouettes delineate regions that are doubly in shadow while those corresponding to boundaries delineate single shadow regions. A 2-D example is shown in Fig. 3.

This technique has been found to be robust over a variety of models, including the ones in this papers. 5 Rendering Rendering shadow volumes can be done in two ways. The first technique follows the common scan line approach <ref> [ Crow 1977 ] </ref> . The shadow surfaces are added to the free form surface database before scan line rendering.

Reference-contexts: Extraction of the surface boundaries is straightforward. Silhouettes that are interior to a surface can be extracted by finding the zero set of Equation (2) or Equation (4) above. One approach <ref> [ Elber 1992a ] </ref> determines solutions within a desired tolerance, by symbolically computing the scalar field expressed in these equations and uses root finding techniques to find the zero set. Symbolically computing Equation (2) or (4), results in the need to find the zero set of a bivariate function. <p> Symbolically computing Equation (2) or (4), results in the need to find the zero set of a bivariate function. The zero sets are computed using a subdivision approach <ref> [ Elber 1992a ] </ref> . This approach was found to be extremely robust for silhouette extraction. The silhouette curves that are extracted do not lie along isoparametric curves of the surface, in general. To extract these silhouettes within a desired tolerance many implementations currently produce piecewise linear curves. <p> surfaces S 1 and S 2 are regular C 1 continuous surfaces, the zero set of Equation (5) provides the domain along the shared edge that is a silhouette viewed along ~ V . g (t) in Equation (5) can be computed symbolically and represented as a single scalar curve <ref> [ Elber 1992a ] </ref> . The extracted contours are again cast into ruled shadow surfaces. The approach is summarized in Algorithm 1. We discuss the orientation component of the algorithm in the next section.

Reference-contexts: To extract these silhouettes within a desired tolerance many implementations currently produce piecewise linear curves. This is undesirable since memory requirements can be large and the approximation can again result in aliasing effects in the rendered image. We are currently examining the use of data reduction techniques <ref> [ Lyche 1987 ] </ref> to increase the order of the extracted silhouettes to significantly reduce their size and alleviate these problems. The extracted contours are then cast in the view direction to produce ruled surfaces that form the boundaries of the shadow volume. <p> Those with one surface normal that is back facing while the other is front facing lie along a silhouette. Data reduction techniques can significantly reduce the size of the piecewise linear approximation by representing them as higher order curves <ref> [ Lyche 1987 ] </ref> . Furthermore, special surface-surface intersection cases, such as those for quadric surfaces, have closed form representations as high order curves. Unfortunately, for shared edges represented as higher order curves, one cannot simply step along the curve as done for the piecewise linear case. <p> The use of Boolean operations requires the grouping of extracted contours curves into closed loops to form true volumes. In addition, data reduction techniques <ref> [ Lyche 1987 ] </ref> may be needed to decrease the data size and raise the order of the extracted contours to increase the robustness and efficiency of the Boolean operations.
