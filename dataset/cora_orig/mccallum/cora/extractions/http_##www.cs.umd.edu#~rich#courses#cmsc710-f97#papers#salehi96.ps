Abstract: VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a high speed network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. We present two basic results. First, we present an optimal smoothing algorithm for achieving the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when transmitting stored video to a client with given buffer size. We provide a formal proof of optimality, and demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guaranteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to be dramatic.

For example, if X = [2; 3; 3; 2] and Y = <ref> [1; 8; 1; 0] </ref>, then X Y . X does appear to be smoother than Y . If X = [12; 3; 7] and Y = [2; 10; 10], neither X Y nor Y X. <p> Thus, we consider a transmission schedule S 1 to be smoother than schedule S 2 if S 1 S 2 . While variance and peak are commonly-used comparative measures of smoothness, such metrics are in fact subsumed by majorization. Since x <ref> [1] </ref> is by definition max (X), it follows that X Y implies max (X) max (Y ). <p> Z is constructed such that X Z and Z Y . 6 Fact 2 If X is linear (i.e., if x 1 = = x n = c), then for all Y such that P n P n Proof: Suppose X 6 Y . Then 9j 2 <ref> [1; n) such that P j cj &gt; i=1 y [i] </ref> . We must have y [j] &lt; c, implying P n c (n j). Together, these imply P n i=1 y [i] &lt; nc, a contradiction. Thus X Y . <p> The fact that A 0 meets A at all concave change points, coupled with the fact that A 0 is linear between change points, implies by Fact 2 that S 0 S outside of the convex regions. Thus, by Fact 1, we have S 0 S over <ref> [1; N ] </ref>. <p> We begin with an overview of the service model, and then turn to performance results. 5.1 Overview Under Guaranteed service, the network provides hard guarantees. Suppose the user requires bounded delay service <ref> [1] </ref>: for each packet sent, the end-to-end delay through the network must not exceed some a priori bound. (This implies that no packets are lost). A call admission algorithm admits the stream into the network only if it can guarantee that the delay bound will never be exceeded. <p> The least upper bound, E (t), is known as the minimum envelope process <ref> [1] </ref> (or empirical envelope [11]). Computed at the frame level for a stored video with N frames, E (t) is given by: E (t) = max k+t X f (j); (1) where f (j) is the size of the j th frame. <p> In the algorithm, T i;j is the minimum cost reservation schedule over segments [i; j] without any renegotiations: T i;j = ( max (c k ))( k=i Let T i;j be 0 if i &gt; j. ! 1;i denotes the cost of cheapest reservation schedule over segments <ref> [1; i] </ref> with r or fewer renegotiations. <p> See text for discussion of notation. <ref> [1; i] </ref>) with no renegotiations (Lines 1-2). It then enters the main loop. The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or fewer renegotiations is computed as the minimium cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the cheapest reservation over [1; j] with (r 1) renegotiations, <p> See text for discussion of notation. <ref> [1; i] </ref>) with no renegotiations (Lines 1-2).

The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or fewer renegotiations is computed as the minimium cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the cheapest reservation over [1; j] with (r 1) renegotiations, followed by a renegotiation after segment j if j 6= i, followed by the cheapest reservation over <p> It then enters the main loop. The cheapest reservation over [1; i] with r or fewer renegotiations is computed as the minimium cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the cheapest reservation over <ref> [1; j] </ref> with (r 1) renegotiations, followed by a renegotiation after segment j if j 6= i, followed by the cheapest reservation over [j + 1; i] without renegotiations. <p> Once B is finished, the cost of the cheapest reservation schedule over <ref> [1; n] </ref>, with R or fewer renegotiations, is given in ! (R) 1;n . B requires O (n) space to compute ! (R) 1;n , since only ! (r1) is needed to compute ! (r) . <p> To address the reduction in network resources required under optimal smoothing, we have considered two important network service models: Guaranteed service (e.g., <ref> [1, 11] </ref>) and Renegotiated CBR service [9]. The impact of workahead smoothing (optimal or otherwise) has not previously been evaluated under either model. We find performance of Guaranteed service improves dramatically under optimal smoothing, with network utilizations increasing by as much as a factor of 3 for bursty VBR streams. <p> Let T i;j = (max ikj (c k ))( k=i L k ) denote the minimum-cost reservation schedule over segments [i; j] without renegotiations, defined to be 0 if i &gt; j. ! i;j denotes the cost of the minimum-cost reservation schedule over <ref> [1; i] </ref>, with no restriction on the number of renegotiations. <p> The algorithm initializes ! 1;i to T 1;i , 1 i n, and then iterates over segments 2 through n. ! 1;i is computed as the minimium cost, over all j 2 f1; : : : ; ig, of the minimum-cost reservation over <ref> [1; j] </ref> (computed on an earlier iteration for j 6= i or during the initialization for j = i), followed by a renegotiation after segment j if j 6= i, followed by the cheapest reservation over [j + 1; i] without renegotiations. <p> Once C is finished, the cost of the cheapest reservation schedule over <ref> [1; n] </ref> is given in ! 1;n . The algorithm requires O (n) space and O (n 2 ) time. To actually generate the minimum-cost reservation schedule requires keeping track of the segment index j which minimizes the expression in Line 4, which can be done in O (n) space. <p> See text for discussion of notation. level. C n;i;m denotes the cost of the cheapest reservation schedule over frames <ref> [1; n] </ref>, ending with buffer level i at time n (after consumption of d (n)), with r m indicating the rate which was reserved by the server for transmission of a (n).

While CBR service offers many advantages (e.g., call admission and switch scheduling are simplified <ref> [7] </ref>), static CBRin which the server provides a one-time specification of the peak rate over the duration of the sessiondoes not perform well for VBR-compressed video, since the peak can be much higher than the mean. Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) adds a bandwidth renegotiation mechanism to static CBR [9, 8]. <p> This corresponds to a mean renegotiation time ranging from 23 minutes down to 14 seconds. The maximum number of unsmoothed streams which can be admitted is also shown. Since network jitter is a much less of anissue under CBR service <ref> [7] </ref>, we assume it is zero. Thus, we consider as the base case that the client has sufficient buffer space to store only the largest frame (43 KB for this video), which is the minimum needed to support the unsmoothed transmission schedule in the absence of network jitter.

To evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing under RCBR, we assume a discrete-time model at the frame level, and a network pricing function (indicating the cost to the server of following a given reservation schedule [9]) of the form: = i=1 N1 X ffi c i ;c i+1 (3) where N is the length of the session, c i is the bandwidth reserved at time i, (x) is the cost of reserving bandwidth x over one time interval, fl is the fixed renegotiation cost, and ffi <p> Renegotiations incur signaling overhead at each switch along the end-to-end path. The network can limit the renegotiation frequency indirectly, through pricing (i.e., by making the cost of renegotiations high) <ref> [9] </ref>, or directly, by imposing a bound R on the number of allowable renegotiations over the length of the session. We will assume the latter scenario. To avoid any a priori assumptions about the feasible range of renegotiation frequency, we treat R as an independent parameter. <p> Finally, they discuss support for limited VCR features (e.g., fast-forward, rewind and pause) when the server transmits in a piecewise-CBR fashion.

In the following sections, we consider two network service models: Deterministic Guaranteed service (or simply Guaranteed service) as formulated in <ref> [11] </ref>, and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service, as formulated in [9]. Guaranteed and CBR service models have been widely studied, and are of particular interest for the transport of compressed video. Interestingly, the benefits of workahead smoothing have not been previously evaluated under either model. <p> It permits no statistical multiplexing, since statistical performance is incompatible with hard guarantees. The advantage is guaranteed performance; the disadvantages are added delay and potentially low utilization for bursty VBR streams under moderate delay bounds <ref> [11] </ref>. As we shall see, under optimal smoothing the performance of Guaranteed service can improve dramat ically for bursty VBR-encoded streams. * RCBR is closely related to traditional CBR service, and employs no temporal multiplexing within the network. <p> A call admission algorithm admits the stream into the network only if it can guarantee that the delay bound will never be exceeded. We use the formulation of bounded-delay Guaranteed service given in <ref> [11] </ref>. Consider a single network switch, as depicted in output port, and assume the delay through the switch fabric is constant. Let the capacity of the outgoing link be C bits/s. A packet arriving at the output port is transmitted immediately if the link is idle, or is buffered otherwise. <p> The least upper bound, E (t), is known as the minimum envelope process [1] (or empirical envelope <ref> [11] </ref>). Computed at the frame level for a stored video with N frames, E (t) is given by: E (t) = max k+t X f (j); (1) where f (j) is the size of the j th frame. <p> In this section, we will use A i (t) = E i (t), as well as concave upper bounds to E i (t), each specified by a set of (; ) pairs (see Section 5.2.2). For FIFO, SP, and EDF link scheduling policies, exact admission control tests are known <ref> [3, 11] </ref>. Assume the n streams are homogeneous (i.e., for all i, A i (t) = A (t)) and require common delay bound d. In this case, FIFO, SP and EDF behave identically, and the admission control test is as follows. <p> See discussion in Section 2.4. Second, to determine the maximum number of admissible streams for a given transmission schedule and delay bound, we compute a traffic constraint function for the schedule, and apply the admission control test (Equation 2 for homogeneous streams with identical delay bounds; see <ref> [15, 11] </ref> for other cases). <p> Here, this translates to assuming the client has a nominal buffer capacity of E (500 ms) = 135 KB. The figure demonstrates the benefit of optimal smoothing, in comparison to the case in which the server follows an unsmoothed transmission schedule, as in <ref> [11] </ref>. 5 With optimal smoothing into the nominal buffer space, the number of admissible streams increases by as much as 100%. With an additional 256 KB at the client, performance improves even further, with network utilization rising above 70%. <p> These results suggest that under optimal smoothing with sufficient client buffer space, Guaranteed service need not introduce delay in order to achieve high utilization. 5.2.2 Homogeneous streams with a practical traffic constraint function The empirical envelope E is not a practical traffic constraint function, since it is difficult to police <ref> [11] </ref>. Cruz [3] showed that a concave, piecewise-linear traffic constraint function can be policied by an n-level leaky bucket (where n is the number of linear segments), which can be implemented efficiently. <p> To achieve comparable performance to the case in which E (t) is used as the constraint function, a large number of (; ) pairs are needed when the server sends VBR-compressed video and follows the unsmoothed transmission schedule <ref> [11] </ref>. Figure 12a demonstrates this phenomenon for the Advertisements stream. For delay bounds over 0-500 ms, eight (; ) pairs are needed to match the performance achieved when the empirical envelope is used. <p> capacity is close to the nominal requirement and a (; ) traffic constraint function is used, the network can generally admit more streams by providing lower-delay service. 5.2.3 Heterogeneous streams To evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing when the network carries multiple heterogeneous streams, we follow the methodology developed in <ref> [11] </ref>. We consider EDF and SP switch scheduling policies. Under EDF, each arriving packet is assigned a deadline based on its arrival time and delay bound. An exact (i.e., necessary and sufficient) admission control test for EDF is known [15, 11]. <p> We consider EDF and SP switch scheduling policies.

We consider three cases: 1) unsmoothed transmissions, as in <ref> [11] </ref>, 2) optimal smoothing into the nominal client buffer space (135 KB for Advertisements clients, 218 KB for Wizard clients), and 3) optimal smoothing when 11 admission, and traffic policing mechanisms.

The impact of workahead smoothing (optimal or otherwise) has not previously been evaluated under either model. We find performance of Guaranteed service improves dramatically under optimal smoothing, with network utilizations increasing by as much as a factor of 3 for bursty VBR streams. <p> See text for discussion of notation. the issue of reducing rate variability is likely to be a central one for quite some time.
