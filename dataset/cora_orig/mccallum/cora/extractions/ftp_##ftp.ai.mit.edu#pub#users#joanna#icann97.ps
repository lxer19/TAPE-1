Abstract: Learning in animals is modular (though not encapsulated), and there is growing interest in modular, non-homogeneous models of learning within the neural networks community. Behavior-based artificial intelligence, with its emphasis on modular components, seems an ideal platform for implementing such systems in autonomous agents. However, historically this community has shunned representation issues, and there is no established system for combining modular control and modular adaptivity. This paper describes a behavior based architecture and de velopment approach designed to enable research in modular adaptivity.

Reference-contexts: Behavior-based artificial intelligence (bbai), which models intelligence as interacting modules of specific behaviors (Minsky 1985), would seem the ideal platform for constructing such systems. However, historically, the first and most successful approach to implement BBAI, subsumption architecture <ref> (Brooks 1991) </ref>, emphasized a lack of representation and learning. All adaptivity arose from the flexibility of the architecture and changes in external state, not changes in the agents' behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Almost no behaviors are independent of any learning module, the exceptions are simple signaling routines: open-loop actions to communicate to the user. This should be expected, BBAI behaviors are supposed to be tightly-coupled perception/action routines, and in animals there is no perception without memory <ref> (Carlson 1994) </ref>. 4 Discussion and Conclusion The memory model we are exploring has many implications for artificial intelligence.

Reference-contexts: Nerve cells appear to have their growth partly regulated by actively seeking correlated signals, which may come from neighboring or even distant regions (Willshaw & von der Malsburg 1976). Over the course of evolution, the functionality of brain regions shift as they become exploited and enervated by different areas <ref> (Livesey 1986) </ref>. Nevertheless, different regions of the brain have markedly different architectures and computational properties. Recent work in AI and neural networks emphasizes the utility of having multiple cooperating learning processes (McClelland, McNaughton & O'Reilly 1995, Moll & Miikkulainen 1997, Turney, Whitley & Anderson 1996).

Reference-contexts: All adaptivity arose from the flexibility of the architecture and changes in external state, not changes in the agents' behaviors. Although more recent work has included adaptive elements <ref> (Maes, Mataric, Meyer, Pollack & Wilson 1996) </ref>, these elements tend to be either a single specialized learning component or a monolithic system to control or design the entire agent. No principled methodology has been established for combining modular behaviors and modular learning.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Brain is an adaptive controller with modular construction. This is not to say that the various processes of the brain are fully encapsulated. Nerve cells appear to have their growth partly regulated by actively seeking correlated signals, which may come from neighboring or even distant regions <ref> (Willshaw & von der Malsburg 1976) </ref>. Over the course of evolution, the functionality of brain regions shift as they become exploited and enervated by different areas (Livesey 1986). Nevertheless, different regions of the brain have markedly different architectures and computational properties.

Reference-contexts: In our architecture, Edmund, this methodology addresses not only the organization of the behaviors, but the process for their development. We also designed Edmund specifically to enable modularized learning. Such considerations are important in BBAI, because the approach depends almost entirely on the hand-coding of an agent's behavior <ref> (Wooldridge & Jennings 1995) </ref>. Edmund is designed to address the issue of scaling the behavior-based approach to building intelligent systems without resorting to a hybrid symbolic / reactive architecture (Bryson under consideration).
