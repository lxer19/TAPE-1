Reference-contexts: Gourret et al [GTT89] used a finite element model to model flesh, and demonstrated deformations due to contact with external objects, specifically the hand grasping an object. Badler and Morris also presented a method for dealing with joint modeling <ref> [BM82] </ref>. Most skin models deform skin due to the spring-like influence of neighboring points, and the influence of underlying structures. None appear to have used simulated muscles that move between fixed end points on different joints, and change shape like real muscles.

Reference-contexts: Some of the best animals have been created for commercial advertising and movies, and details of the methods used are not published. Two excellent recent examples are the polar bears of Rhythm and Hues <ref> [RH94, Car94] </ref> and the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park [Stu93, Dun93].

Reference-contexts: Both were initially digitized from material models. 2 Two major problems with simulating animal (including human) bodies are simulating the effect of muscle bulges dependent on joint positions, and creating a skin near joints that appears natural for any joint position. Several years ago, Chadwick et al <ref> [CHP89] </ref> presented a method for constructing deformable animated characters. While no attempt was made to be anatomically correct (indeed, characters were meant to be more of the expressive cartoon type than real animals), their multi-layered construction using some physical simulation produced very expressive characters.

Reference-contexts: None appear to have used simulated muscles that move between fixed end points on different joints, and change shape like real muscles. Realistic simulation of humans has long been a central interest of Magnenat-Thalmann and Thalmann and their collaborators <ref> [MTT83, MTT87, fCGF91, MTT91b] </ref>. A recent paper [MTT91a] describes a method of creating natural looking skin over joints, which they emphasize as an extremely difficult problem to deal with simply and well. Considerable work has been done on the human face [Par82, Wat87, TF88, Wil90, TW90, TW91, LTW93].

Reference-contexts: Next, a transformation defining the relation of the new muscle axis to the origin segment coordinate frame must found. This can be done using techniques described in standard graphics texts <ref> [FDFH90] </ref> for rotating a given vector into another arbitrary vector. I.e., find a local coordinate system for which the muscle axis vector is the Z-axis by taking a cross-product of the axis vector with a non-parallel vector, and then taking a cross-product of the axis vector with the new vector.
