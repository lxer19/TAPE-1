Abstract: kj = 1. The standard PPR algorithm of Friedman and Stuet-zle (1981) estimates the smooth functions f j using the supersmoother nonparametric scatterplot smoother. Friedman's algorithm constructs a model with M max linear combinations, then prunes back to a simpler model of size M M max , where M and M max are specified by the user. This paper discusses an alternative algorithm in which the smooth functions are estimated using smoothing splines. The direction coefficients ff j , the amount of smoothing in each direction, and

Reference-contexts: A training set of size 400 was generated uniformly over the complete range of the angles 1 2 [0; 2], 2 2 [0; 2], 2 [=2; =2], and arm lengths in the range ` 1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and ` 2 2 [0; 1]. Table 3 presents the results of the high dimensional examples. In the robot arm example, it is hard to select the correct model size for the SMART fit, as the training FVU plot has a number of plateaus. <p> A training set of size 400 was generated uniformly over the complete range of the angles 1 2 [0; 2], 2 2 [0; 2], 2 [=2; =2], and arm lengths in the range ` 1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and ` 2 2 [0; 1].
