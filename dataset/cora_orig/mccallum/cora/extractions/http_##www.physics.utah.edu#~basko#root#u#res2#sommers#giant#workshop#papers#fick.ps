Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Pierre Auger Observatory will have at least one nitrogen fluorescence detector at its center which will act in combination with the ground array for approximately 10% of the running time. It has been shown by Monte Carlo simulation <ref> [1] </ref> that it is possible to use information from the ground array to improve the trajectory determination capabilities of either the central optical detector or the ground array alone. The advantage of this situation is that stereo observations, requiring overlapping viewing volumes, are not strictly required to reconstruct shower trajectories.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will demonstrate the validity of the time constrained hybrid trajectory method using data from a presently operating lower energy (10 17 eV hybrid cosmic ray detector facility. 2 MIA and HiRes detectors The hybrid detector facility consists of the High Resolution Flys Eye (HiRes) prototype detector <ref> [2] </ref> and the Michigan Underground Muon Array (MIA) [3] situated at Dugway, Utah USA. On clear, moonless nights HiRes observes the nitrogen fluorescence produced by the passage of an extensive air shower through the atmosphere. <p> The SDP is found using a fit to the HiRes hit tube directions, where each point is weighted by the tube amplitude. The resulting plane normal vector which describes the SDP can be determined in this manner with an accuracy of 0:2 ffi . <ref> [2] </ref> In the second stage of track reconstruction the orientation and position of the shower axis within the shower plane are determined. This amounts to finding the two quantities R p and 0 as defined in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The detection of such a flash is used to supplement the time matching and to promote "lone MIA"(non-CASA) triggers. Details on the performance of the system is described elsewhere <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 Mono and Hybrid Trajectory Finding Methods The process of trajectory finding occurs in two stages. First, the shower detector plane (SDP) is determined. The SDP is found using a fit to the HiRes hit tube directions, where each point is weighted by the tube amplitude.

Reference-contexts: The implicit assumption is that the uncertainties in method A trajectories are negligible with respect to those of the other two methods. We have estimated the statistical error on R p and o for method A using the Bootstrap method <ref> [5] </ref>. For the data set to be described later in this note we find that 50% of the events have R p errors less thatn 24.0 m and 90% have errors less than 39 m. The corresponding numbers for the angle 0 are 0:45 ffi and 1:03 ffi respectively.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the means of the mono distributions are shifted by over 100 meters in R p and 3 ffi in 0 . Apparently the same sort of shifts were seen when comparing mono trajectories with stereo trajectories using the old Utah Fly's Eye data <ref> [6] </ref>. It is evidently an artifact of the mono fitting procedure itself. The source of the width of the method B method A distributions is not exactly known.
