Simple broadcast of a message among a set of programs called BMS clients. 2. Invocation of other programs. Programs that wish to use BMS's features must register to use them, thereby becoming BMS clients.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction BMS (Broadcast Message Server) is a general message-routing service which provides simple broadcast of message strings among a set of client programs written in C or Ada. It can also invoke other programs on request. BMS has been used to integrate the SDL PIC <ref> [4] </ref> demo and the TESS [2] user interface. BMS runs under SunOS 4.x and is implemented on top of Q [3] from the University of Colorado.
