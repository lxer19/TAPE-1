Reference-contexts: This is a non-monotonic step and is equivalent to the collapsing of maximal intervals in the Allen and Koomen set-up. The event calculus <ref> [ Kowalski and Sergot, 1986 ] </ref> also faces this difficulty once it is made to handle interval reasoning. Here, the property p is assumed to hold at time t if some event earlier than t initiated p and nothing terminated p in between.

Reference-contexts: However, comparison with a number of alternatives indicates that this is a more profound problem than that. In the Time Map Management (TMM) system of [ Dean and McDermott, 1987 ] the same problem occurs here as an intractability involved with stretching and clipping (read <ref> [ Materne and Hertzberg, 1991 ] </ref> for an account). In that system a property p is asserted to hold for a certain interval but there is uncertainty about the limits of the interval.
