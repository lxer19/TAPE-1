Title: Asymptotic Distribution of the Errors in Scalar and Vector Quantizers  
Author: Don H. Lee David L. Neuhoff 
Keyword: INDEX TERMS Asymptotic quantization, high-rate quantization, high-resolution quantization, vector quantization, error distribution, error density, point density, inertial profile, shape function, shape profile.  
Abstract: High-rate (or asymptotic) quantization theory has found formulas for the average squared length (more generally, the q-th moment of the length) of the error produced by various scalar and vector quantizers with many quantization points. In contrast, this paper finds an asymptotic formula for the probability density of the length of the error and, in certain special cases, for the probability density of the multidimensional error vector, itself. The latter can be used to analyze the distortion of twostage vector quantization. The former permits one to learn about the point density and cell shapes of a quantizer from a histogram of quantization error lengths. Histograms of the error lengths in simulations agree well with the derived formulas. Also presented are a number of properties of the error density, including the relationship between the error density, the point density and the cell shapes, the fact that its qth moment equals Bennett's integral (a formula for the average distortion of a scalar or vector quantizer), and the fact that for stationary sources, the mar-ginals of the multidimensional error density of an optimal vector quantizer with large dimension are approximately IID Gaussian.

(4) A lower bound: Let r min (x) be the inner radius of the cells in the vicinity of x.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the error density formulas can be used to aid the investigation of certain complex quantization schemes, such as treestructured vector quantization (c.f. <ref> [8] </ref>). An outline of the paper is as follows. First, for scalar quantizers, Section 2 derives the form of the density of the error. <p> Indeed the relationship is strong enough that it is possible to learn something about the point density and cell shapes from empirical measurements of the error density; i.e. from histograms. This has proved useful, for example, in investigations of treestructured vector quantization <ref> [8] </ref>. For this reason we now examine closely the shape of the 16 pulse. <p> Actually, the histograms are more consistent with the complementary aspect ratios 1.3 and 1.7. An examination of the cells confirmed the predominance of such shapes. However, the histograms were the first evidence of this unexpected phenomenon. See <ref> [8] </ref> for further details. In higher dimensions, it is not possible to examine the cells directly. Example 3.5: For an IID Gaussian source, Figure 11 (a) superimposes the error density based on 2-dimensional spherical cells (3.16) with that based on hexagonal cells (3.12).

Reference-contexts: That the error lengths of an optimal quantizer with large dimension should be approximately constant can also be deduced by the following argument: When k is large, the asymptotic equipartition property (c.f. <ref> [29, pp. 26, 27] </ref> for memoryless random processes and [30] for stationary random processes) shows that the source density is approximately constant on a region of k-dimensional space whose total probability is approximately one. Therefore, the optimal point density is approximately constant on this region.

Reference-contexts: Two styles of arguments have been used in the asymptotic quantization literature: informal, as in [2,4,12-23], and rigorous, as in [1,3,5,24-27]. As this paper contains the first results on the asymptotic error density, to maximize its approachability, we take the informal approach. A companion paper <ref> [28] </ref> gives rigorous formulations and proofs of the principal results. II.

Reference-contexts: slopes of the peaks correspond to the value of w that just reaches the short side of the rectangle. 18 Example 3.4: Figure 10 shows the error histograms for two 2-dimensional treestructured vector quantizers designed for a Gauss-Markov source with correlation coefficient r = .9 by the usual greedy algorithm <ref> [33] </ref>. The first has 256 points, the second has 512. The histogram for the 256-point quantizer is quite similar to the error density predicted for a quantizer with an optimum point density and square cells, as shown in Figure 9. <p> So its goodness in two dimensions gives us confidence that it will be good in higher dimensions, as well. This is fortunate because the shape function for the best cell in dimension three (a truncated octahedron <ref> [33] </ref>) is difficult to compute. And in higher dimensions the best cell shape is unknown. Thus for dimensions 3 or greater, we must rely on the spherical cell approximation.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the error length density was shown to be essentially constant. Since the error density is also spherically symmetric, one may conclude that its marginals are approximately Gaussian (c.f. <ref> [34] </ref>, pp. 71 ff.) with independent and identically distributed components (IID). This is a direct derivation of what is sometimes claimed based on Shannon lower bound arguments.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, for squared error (q = 2), the Shannon lower bound to the ratedistortion function is asymptotically tight for small distortion (large rate), and when it is tight, the test channel achieving the distortion-rate function is such that the difference between its input and output is IID Gaussian ( <ref> [35, Chapter 4] </ref>. This suggests that an optimal quantizer with large dimension and rate, which approximately achieves the ratedistortion function, will produce errors whose marginals are IID Gaussian, because the code should behave somewhat like an optimum test channel.
