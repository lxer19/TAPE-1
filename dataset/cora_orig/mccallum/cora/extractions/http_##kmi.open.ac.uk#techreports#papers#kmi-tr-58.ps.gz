Reference-contexts: Empirical 95% confidence intervals were also computed by using 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles. The imputation algorithm was implemented in R (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996), an environment implementing the S Language <ref> (Becker et al., 1988) </ref> and execution time ex ceeded 15 minutes against less than 1 sec for bc. Results are in Table 8. The comparison reveals the extreme accuracy of bc estimates.

Reference-contexts: Under the mar assumption this is the asymptotic approximation of the posterior distribu tion based on the generalized mle <ref> (Berger, 1985) </ref> of the parameters, if the prior hyper parameters were all increased by 1. Similarly, the marginal posterior distribution of +j can be approximated by a D ( ^ff +j1 ; ^ff +j2 ), with hyperparameters chosen to match (19) and ^ V ( +j jS) given above. 5.

Reference-contexts: The Conservative party won by 7.6 %. "An 8.5 % error, the largest ever." <ref> (Butler and Kavanagh, 1992, page 135) </ref>. An inquiry conducted by the Market Research Society found out that one of the major causes of the disaster, accounting for more than the 2 % of the error, laid in the voting intentions not expressed during the polls. <p> It is believed that "nonrespondents to polls before the 1992 British General Election were more heavily pro-Conservative than respondents" (Forster and Smith, 1998). Here we investigate particular assumptions on the missing-data mechanism, including the Silent Conservative effect <ref> (Butler and Kavanagh, 1992) </ref>, and we compare the bc estimates with Imputation-based ones. We first assume that non-respondents are truly uncertain among the three major parties, and we model this assumption by setting j 1 2 3 4 jjih 0:32 0:32 0:32 0:04 for all h; i.

Reference-contexts: follow up surveys revealed that Tories gained disproportionately among those who made up their mind at the last minute and that, in general, Conservative voters were less inclined to declare their voting intention. 1.1 Missing-Data Mechanisms Incomplete samples challenge the analyst because they hit the very foundations of modern statistics <ref> (Copas and Li, 1997) </ref>: missing data can affect the randomness of a sample, thus removing the grounds for the use of most statistical methods.

Reference-contexts: The parameterization of the joint probability distribution of (X; Y ) induces parameterizations of the marginal distributions of X and Y , and of the r and c conditional distributions of Y jx = i and Xjy = j. The result is known <ref> (Fang et al., 1990, page 19) </ref> but, since it is crucial for the development of the subsequent theory, it is recalled here without proof. 5 Bayesian Inference with Missing Data Using Bound and Collapse Theorem 1 Let = ( 11 ; 12 ; ; rc ) ~ D (ff), ff =

Reference-contexts: These assumptions are also known as local and global independence (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990) in the field of Bayesian Belief Networks. We merely note here that, as long as the hyperparameters of the prior distributions are chosen consistently, exact Bayesian analysis leads to identical conclusions under both parameterizations <ref> (Geiger and Heckerman, 1997) </ref>. 2.2 Incomplete Samples Exact Bayesian analysis presents no difficulties as long as the sample is complete. Suppose now that some of the entries on the variable Y are reported as unknown.

Reference-contexts: However, posterior distributions of the joint probabilities of (X; Y ) and of the marginal probabilities of Y do not have simple expressions. A nowaday popular solution is to resort to MCMC methods, such as Gibbs Sampling <ref> (Geman and Geman, 1984) </ref>, and treat missing entries as unknown parameters. The procedure will eventually return a sample from the posterior distribution of quantities of interest, from which empirical estimates and credibility intervals can be computed. A detailed description appears in Gilks and Roberts (1996).

Reference-contexts: We denote p (Y = jjX 1 = i; X 2 = h; ) by ihj . We also assume a Perks prior distribution ~ D (ff), with ff ihj = 1=40 <ref> (Good, 1968) </ref>, so that the total prior precision is 1. From the specification of the prior distribution of , we can derive prior distributions of the parameters of the model by using Theorem 1.

Reference-contexts: Given that the sampling model is a multinomial distribution with parameter vector , and ij = p (X = i; Y = jj), a conjugate prior for is a Dirichlet distribution, and the posterior distribution of is still Dirichlet <ref> (Lindley, 1964) </ref>. From the joint posterior distribution of , posterior distributions of the conditional probabilities of Y given X, and of the marginal probabilities of Y can be easily derived. Measures of association between X and Y can also be inferred.

Reference-contexts: Suppose first that the poste rior distribution of +j is approximated to a Beta to match mean and variance. To evaluate the goodness of the approximation, we have generated a sample of 5,000 observations from the posterior distribution of ++J using the Gibbs Sampler implemeted in Bugs5 <ref> (Thomas et al., 1992) </ref> after a first burn-in of 1,000 observations. The results are in Table 6. Credi bility intervals computed via the bc approximation are extremely accurate. 95% credibility intervals obtained by using a Normal approximation are (0.4204;0.4858), (0.3128;0.3764), (0.1466;0.1968) and (0.0192;0.0420).

Reference-contexts: A credibility interval for ij can be calculated using ij jS ~ D (ff ij + n ij ; ff + n ff ij n ij ), <ref> (Wilks, 1963, Ch 7.7) </ref>. The fact that the joint posterior distribution of is still Dirichlet leads to a simple updating rule for the distributions of I , J , Ijj and Jji .
