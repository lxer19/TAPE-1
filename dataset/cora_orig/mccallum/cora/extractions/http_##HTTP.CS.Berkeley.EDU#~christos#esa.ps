Reference-contexts: As it is also typical with the work by economists cited above, in each case we focus on a particular decision-making task. 2 Competitive distributed optimization The first problem is a simple scheduling problem <ref> [7, 1] </ref> in which the schedulers share information about the length of the tasks in limited ways. <p> It is easy to see that, the richer the graph in edges the better the decision; but the precise law is quite subtle and often counterintuitive. Naturally, a basic question is, how does one evaluate the quality of a decision by the three agents? In <ref> [1] </ref> we adopt competitive analysis as our evaluation method. That is, a decision-making protocol is good if the ratio of the makespan achieved by the protocol, divided by the optimum schedule for the same tasks, and maximized over all task lengths, is small |as close to 1 as possible.

Reference-contexts: Imagine the following situation <ref> [2] </ref>. An organization is a tree of decision-makers, with Boss at the root, first-level managers immediately below, and so on. Each decision-maker sets the value of a set of variables in a linear program, and has his/her own linear objective function. All constraints and objective functions are known to all.

Reference-contexts: Radner and Van Zandt [11] use the PRAM model (!) to gain insight into the limits to growth of hierarchies that perform certain computational tasks; a similar model is used by Geanakoplos and Milgrom <ref> [3] </ref> to study returns to scale in hierarchies that perform resource allocation tasks. Prat [5] uses a simple circuit model to justify hierarchies of managers with abilities increasing with height in the tree as an optimal organization principle.

Reference-contexts: These and similar constraints are also studied in various contexts in theoretical computer science. Very recently, economists working on organization theory have began to take note and make use of various concepts and techniques from our field. For example, Marschak <ref> [4] </ref> uses communication complexity as a measure of the difficulty of the management task, and studies "economies of scale" that may result when independent communication complexity problems are combined into one (for example, when firms merge).

Reference-contexts: What is the complexity of each decision-maker carrying out his/her own decision? It is obviously polynomially easy for the leaves, but how hard is it for the higher levels? The answer here is clean and not unexpected: The problem is complete for the class p L of the polynomial hierarchy <ref> [6] </ref>, where L is the depth of the subtree below the decision-maker.

Reference-contexts: Incidentally, this was to my knowledge the first time that competitive analysis was used to analyze situations in which the missing information is not "the future," but information about another site in a distributed system. In <ref> [8] </ref> we embarked on an analysis, from the same point of view, of linear programming, a much more comprehensive optimization problem. We assume that a group of decision makers must solve a sparse linear program, with positive coefficients. <p> However, we can bound it from above and below by two parameters that are easier to compute |just NP-complete: The directed clique number and the chromatic number of the colored hypergraph (see <ref> [8] </ref> for the definitions). The tightness of the bounds, and whether the ratio is closer to the one or the other, varies widely with the colored hypergraph.

Reference-contexts: For example, Marschak [4] uses communication complexity as a measure of the difficulty of the management task, and studies "economies of scale" that may result when independent communication complexity problems are combined into one (for example, when firms merge). Communication complexity is also used by Segal <ref> [9] </ref>, this time to argue that authority is an optimal management technique in certain contexts.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since the classical work of Simon <ref> [10] </ref>, and with increased intensity in recent years, economists have studied organizations as systems of decision-makers operating under imperfect information, communication, rationality, and coordination. These and similar constraints are also studied in various contexts in theoretical computer science.
