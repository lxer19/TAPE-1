Abstract: In this paper we review and extend the effective bandwidth results of Kelly [28], and Kesidis, Walrand and Chang [29, 6]. These results provide a framework for call admission schemes which are sensitive to constraints on the mean delay or the tail distribution of the workload in buffered queues. We present results which are valid for a wide variety of traffic streams and discuss their applicability for traffic management in ATM networks. We discuss the impact of traffic policing schemes, such as thresholding and filtering, on the effective bandwidth of sources. Finally we discuss effective bandwidth results for Brownian traffic models for which explicit results reveal the interaction arising in finite buffers.

Reference-contexts: Given the rather abstract conditions for the existence of effective bandwidths presented above, one might ask which types of sources will not have an effective bandwidth. This question is closely related to the manner in which overflows occur in queues, see Anantharam <ref> [1] </ref>. For a GI/GI/1 queue in which the distribution of G. de Veciana and J.

Reference-contexts: In fact we will show that this is true if we consider all such policies with the same throughput and if arrivals are i.i.d. but may not hold otherwise. The following result was inspired by a problem concerning optimal re-insurance of policies, see Asmussen <ref> [2, page 287] </ref>. Proposition 4.1 Suppose fA n g is an i.i.d. sequence satisfying a large deviation principle. Consider all memoryless rejection policies, h (), with the same throughput , i.e., such that E h (A n ) = E A n .

Reference-contexts: Note however, that by choosing to reject a fraction of the input traffic, in some cases a significant (almost quadratic) reduction of the effective bandwidth can be obtained. One would expect these conclusions to be approximately true for non-Gaussian sources. Berger and Whitt <ref> [3] </ref> come to similar conclusions for the popular leaky bucket scheme, showing that asymptotic variability of the output traffic stream depends only on the total capacity of the system, i.e., what is lost, rather than the relative size of the job versus the token buffer.

Reference-contexts: An extension to feed-forward networks, via a study of the input-output properties of queues, is proposed in de Veciana, Courcoubetis and Walrand [11].

Whitt [7] and Botvich and Duffield <ref> [4] </ref>, show that asymptotic effective bandwidth results can be either optimistic or conservative depending on the nature of the arrival streams.

Reference-contexts: It follows from the Gartner-Ellis theorem that C n satisfies a large deviation principle. In fact the asymptotic log-moment generating function of the service process fc + C n g is fl c () = c + 2 2 2 (1a) 2 (see Bucklew <ref> [5, page 22] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach has been to investigate large buffer asymptotics via the theory of large deviations. The work of Kesidis, Walrand and Chang [29] and Chang <ref> [6] </ref>, identified under some rather general conditions the existence of effective bandwidths. The work of Glynn and Whitt [34, 22] independently encompasses much of the material herein and provides several additional clean results. <p> We discuss a simple extension of this result to a system with prioritized service and multiple average delay constraints. Next, in Section 3, we extend the approach of Kesidis et al. [29] and Chang <ref> [6] </ref> both of whom used large deviations to obtain effective bandwidths where the criterion is the likelihood of a large workload or queue length in a discrete-time queue. We give a direct proof of this result including a large class of stationary G. de Veciana and J. <p> The result is drawn from Kesidis et al. [29] and Chang <ref> [6] </ref>. We present a direct proof via large deviations and discuss some examples of randomized service. We begin by reviewing the statement and possible requirements for large deviation results to hold. For a complete reference on the subject see Dembo and Zeitouni [13]. <p> For example, (random) coordinate functions of Markov chains satisfying strong uniformity conditions on the transition kernel and tails will satisfy an LDP. For stationary sequences satisfying appropriate mixing and tail conditions similar results hold. G. de Veciana and J.

Traffic streams without sufficient randomness are excluded from our framework, however, Chang <ref> [6] </ref> has developed an interesting point of view unifying stochastic and deterministic sources via the notion of envelope processes. 4 On cell admission and filtering It is reasonable to ask how packet admission policies might decrease the effective bandwidth of a source.

Reference-contexts: We present a direct proof via large deviations and discuss some examples of randomized service. We begin by reviewing the statement and possible requirements for large deviation results to hold. For a complete reference on the subject see Dembo and Zeitouni <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> Recall that W m 0 is given by W m 0nm Since the sequence fX n g is stationary and ergodic, the limits lim 1 log E exp [S n ] = fl () must exist. Moreover, by Theorem 4.5.10 in <ref> [13] </ref>, or directly from the Gartner-Ellis Theorem, the rate function is in fact the convex dual of fl (), i.e., I (ff) = fl fl (ff) = sup [ff fl ()]: Thus for * &gt; 0 there is an n * such that 8n &gt; n * ; E exp [S <p> Indeed if fl () &lt; 1 then lim jxj!1 fl fl (x)=jxj = 1, so ff fl above makes sense (see Dembo and Zeitouni <ref> [13, page 34] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: An extension to feed-forward networks, via a study of the input-output properties of queues, is proposed in de Veciana, Courcoubetis and Walrand [11]. In addition recent numerical as well as analytical studies, e.g., K. Rege <ref> [31] </ref>, G. Choudhury, D. Lucantoni and W. Whitt [7] and Botvich and Duffield [4], show that asymptotic effective bandwidth results can be either optimistic or conservative depending on the nature of the arrival streams. These and other studies indicate that caution is warranted in using the effective bandwidth concept.

Reference-contexts: For example, recent detailed studies for variable bit rate video traffic consider the dynamics of loss and traffic policing schemes, see Reininger and Raychaudhuri <ref> [32] </ref>. In particular, a coder may adapt the level of quantization when the traffic rate exceeds a threshold, and thereby improve the overall performance, while maintaining the traffic within negotiated rate constraints. We complete this discussion of admission policies with an insightful example suggested by Courcoubetis and Weber [9].

Reference-contexts: Using Little's result one obtains the expected delay before service of the two types of traffic, E D 1 and E D 2 , as a function of the traffic statistics and the number of sources of each type (see Walrand <ref> [33, page 128] </ref>): E D 1 = i=1 n i i ( 2 i ) ; E D 2 = i=1 n i i ( 2 i ) P 2 : Now suppose we require that ED 1 d 1 and E D 2 d 2 , then the following conditions

Reference-contexts: This problem has recently received much attention; in fact as of the writing of this paper much work has appeared. Below we provide a brief review of related work as a guide to the interested reader; a more complete account can be found in Whitt <ref> [34] </ref>. Among the first studies of effective bandwidths is an analysis of buffer-less systems by Hui [25]. The paper of Kelly [28], discussed herein, reported the first results for buffered systems subject to either mean delay or tail constraints. <p> An alternative approach has been to investigate large buffer asymptotics via the theory of large deviations. The work of Kesidis, Walrand and Chang [29] and Chang [6], identified under some rather general conditions the existence of effective bandwidths. The work of Glynn and Whitt <ref> [34, 22] </ref> independently encompasses much of the material herein and provides several additional clean results. Finally a novel result by Duffield and O'Connell [15], considers the case of traffic streams with long range correlations, or self-similar structure, where the scaling and results differ from those discussed in this paper. <p> These cases have been analyzed in the heavy traffic regime by Fendick and Whitt [19]. Their results give approximate effective bandwidths for superpositions of such streams subject to a mean delay constraint. A more complete discussion of heavy traffic approximations in this context can be found in Whitt <ref> [34] </ref>. For illustrative purposes let us further consider the heavy traffic approximation to a discrete-time multi-class deterministic queue with service rate c. Suppose packets in a stream of a given class j 2 J , have stationary arrivals fA j n g, with mean 1 j .
