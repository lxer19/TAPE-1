Abstract: We investigate the frequency of complete sets for various complexity classes within EXP under non-adaptive reductions in the sense of resource bounded measure. We show that these sets are rare: A key ingredient is the Small Span Theorem, which states that for any set A in EXP at least one of its lower span (i.e., the sets that reduce to A) or its upper span (i.e., the sets that A reduces to) has p 2 -measure zero. Previous to our work, the theorem was only known to hold for 6 p ktt -reductions for any constant k. We establish it for 6 p n o(1) tt -reductions.

Reference-contexts: The strongest Small Span Theorem previous to our work was due to Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ASNT96] </ref>, who proved it for 6 p btt -reductions. The extension to reductions with a non-constant number of queries was a notorious open problem in the area. <p> Previously, it was only known for 6 p btt -reductions that the p 2 -measure of the complete sets for EXP have p 2 -measure zero <ref> [ASNT96, BM95] </ref>. We also obtain that the p 2 -measure of the 6 n ff tt -hard sets for E and EXP is zero. <p> Since we have log q 2 O (log n i ), we get a contradiction to the Kolmogorov randomness of . Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ASNT96] </ref> focused on p-measure, and they established the equivalent of Theorem 6 and the Small Span Theorem within E for 6 p ktt -reductions for any constant k. A similar Kolmogorov argument as above indicates that our techniques are not powerful enough to extend these results to stronger reductions.

Reference-contexts: So, measure zero results for the autoreducible sets will imply measure zero results for the complete sets for the -levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy and EXP. Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigderson <ref> [BFNW93] </ref> established the existence of a pseudo-random generator that can be used to simulate BPP in subexponential time for infinitely many input lengths unless MA = EXP. Using their ideas, we are able to prove that the 6 p tt -autoreducible sets have p-measure zero unless MA = EXP. <p> The proof follows directly from the next results of Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigderson <ref> [BFNW93] </ref>, and Nisan and Wigderson [NW94], combined with some padding.

Reference-contexts: A set A is autoreducible if on input x, when allowed to make queries to A except for x itself, we can decide in polynomial-time whether x 2 A. Buhrman, Fortnow and Torenvliet <ref> [BFT95] </ref> showed that the 6 p T -complete sets for EXP are 6 p T -autoreducible and their techniques also allow to prove that the 6 p tt -complete sets for -levels of the polynomial <p>- time hierarchy are 6 p tt -autoreducible. <p> enumeration M i including all 6 p tt -autoreductions such that M i (x) is computable in time (2 jxj + i) O (1) , the supermartingale system ~ d M i is p-uniform, this proves that the 6 tt -autoreducible sets have p-measure zero. fl Buhrman, Fortnow and Torenvliet <ref> [BFT95] </ref> showed that all 6 p T -complete sets for EXP are 6 T -autoreducible. Their techniques also yield the following: 11 Theorem 13 For any k, the 6 p tt -complete sets for p p tt -autoreducible. Here is the proof idea. <p> Even the 6 p btt -case remains open. Regarding our results using the hypothesis MA 6= EXP, we would like to see our technique applied to NP. The 6 p tt -complete sets for NP are only known to be autoreducible under non-uniform 6 tt -autoreductions <ref> [BFT95] </ref>, where the advice consists of random strings fed to a Valiant-Vazirani algorithm. <p> following from the assumption MA 6= EXP to extend Theorem 14 to NP? For EXP (and E), our approach cannot work, because it relativizes, and in a world where EXP = EXPSPACE, MA 6= EXP but not all 6 p tt -complete sets for EXP are 6 p tt -autoreducible <ref> [BFT95] </ref>. Using efficient pseudo-random generators with exponential security at every length, a simplified version of Theorem 11 shows that the class of 6 p T -autoreducible sets has p 2 -measure zero. Since all 6 p T -complete sets for EXP are 6 p T -autoreducible [BFT95], this immediately yields that <p> 6 p tt -autoreducible <ref> [BFT95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we follow that line of research. We investigate complete and hard sets for NP, the levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy, PSPACE and EXP, and give some evidence that they have p 2 -measure zero. On the other hand, the results of Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref> imply that the 6 tt -hard sets for BPP do not have p 2 -measure zero; Allender and Strauss [AS94] even showed they have p 2 -measure 1 in EXP. fl Partially supported by the Dutch foundation for scientific research (NWO) through SION project 612-34-002, and by the European Union <p> A positive answer would be the best result provable by relativizable techniques, since Theorem 6 fails for unbounded growing exponent ff in a world where BPP = EXP, and such a world exists [Hel86]. This follows from the relativizable result of Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref> that (P 1 tt (A)) = 1 for any A 2 BPP. Because of the same reason, relativizable techniques cannot establish the Small Span Theorem for 6 tt -reductions. It seems unlikely that our approach allows to establish Theorem 6 for ff &gt; 1, because of Lemma 7.

Reference-contexts: The proof goes as follows: First, for a given 6 p tt -autoreduction M running in time n c , we construct a martingale d M computable in time 2 log O (c) n that succeeds on all sets which M autoreduces. This implies the known theorem <ref> [BL96] </ref> that for any c, the class of sets 6 p tt -autoreducible in time n c , has p 2 -measure zero.

Reference-contexts: The extension to reductions with a non-constant number of queries was a notorious open problem in the area. We establish the Small Span Theorem for 6 p n o (1) tt -reductions, i.e., for non-adaptive reductions that make a subpolynomial number of queries. Lutz <ref> [Lut95] </ref> obtained a Small Span Theorem for non-uniform reductions w.r.t. p-space measure. Similar to his proof, our Small Span Theorem follows from the fact that most sets in EXP have a 6 n o (1) tt -upper span with p 2 -measure zero.
