Abstract: We present a vision system for the 3-D model-based tracking of unconstrained human movement. Using image sequences acquired simultaneously from multiple views, we recover the 3-D body pose at each time instant without the use of markers. The pose-recovery problem is formulated as a search problem and entails finding the pose parameters of a graphical human model whose synthesized appearance is most similar to the actual appearance of the real human in the multi-view images. The models used for this purpose are acquired from the images. We use a decomposition approach and a best-first technique to search through the high dimensional pose parameter space. A robust variant of chamfer matching is used as a fast similarity measure between synthesized and real edge images. We present initial tracking results from a large new Humans-In-Action (HIA) database containing more than 2500 frames in each of four orthogonal views. They contain subjects involved in a variety of activities, of various degrees of complexity, ranging from the more simple one-person hand waving to the challenging two-person close interaction in the Argentine Tango.

Reference-contexts: There is a trade-off between the accuracy of representation and the number of parameters used in the model. Many highly accurate surface models have been used in the field of graphics <ref> [1] </ref> to model the human body, often containing thousands of polygons obtained from actual body scans. <p> See <ref> [1] </ref> for more sophisticated modeling. Regarding shape, we felt that simple cylindrical primitives (possibly with elliptic XY-cross-sections) [4] [8] [18] would not represent body parts such as the head and torso accurately enough.

Reference-contexts: Similarity measure In our approach the similarity measure between model view and actual scene is based on arbitrary edge contours rather than on straight line approximations (as in [18], for example); we use a robust variant of chamfer matching <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The resulting distance map is the so-called "chamfer image" (see Figures 6b and 6c). It would be efficient if we could use only DD (M; S) during pose search (as done in <ref> [2] </ref>), where M and S are the projected model edges and scene edges, respectively. In that case, the scene chamfer image would have to be computed only once, followed by fast access for different model projections.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach is to work directly with 2-D features derived from the images, using some form of 2-D model [7] [11] or not <ref> [3] </ref> [16]. Recognition systems using 2-D model-free features have been able to claim early successes in matching human movement patterns. For constrained types of human movement (such as walking parallel to the image plane, involving periodic motion), many of these features have been successfully used for classification, as in [16].

Downton and Drouet <ref> [4] </ref> attempt to track unconstrained upper-body motion, but must conclude that the tracking gets lost due to propagation of errors. Goncalves et al. [6] use a Kalman-filtering approach to track arm movement from single-view images where the shoulder remains fixed.

Reference-contexts: The aim of the first component is to reconstruct from the sequence of multi-view frames the (approximate) 3-D body pose of the human (s) at each time instant; this serves as input to the movement recognition component. In an earlier paper <ref> [5] </ref> we considered movement recognition as a classification problem and we used a Dynamic Time Warping method to match a test sequence with several reference sequences representing prototypical activities. The features used for matching were various 3-D joint angles of the human body.

Reference-contexts: The determination of the major axis can be achieved robustly by iteratively applying a principal component analysis (PCA) <ref> [9] </ref> on data points sampled from the region of interest. This process results in the removal of the data points corresponding to the hands if they are located lateral to the torso, and also of other types of noise.

Reference-contexts: This involves the human subject facing the camera frontally and sideways. We assume 2-D segmentation in the two orthogonal views; a way to obtain such a segmentation is proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>. Back-projecting the 2-D projected contours of a quadric gives the 3-D occluding contours, after which a coarse-to-fine search procedure is used over a reasonable range of parameter space to determine the best-fitting quadric.

Recognition systems using 2-D model-free features have been able to claim early successes in matching human movement patterns. <p> Self-occlusion makes the 2-D tracking problem hard for arbitrary movements and thus existing systems assume some a-priori knowledge of the type of movement and/or the viewpoint under which it is observed. 2-D labeling and tracking under more general conditions is attempted by <ref> [11] </ref>. We therefore investigate in this paper the more general-purpose approach of recovering 3-D pose through time, in terms of 3-D joint angles defined with respect to a human-centered 3-D motion recovery from 2-D images is often an ill-posed problem.

Reference-contexts: We synthesize appearances of the human model for all the available views, and evaluate the appropriateness of a 3-D pose based on the similarity measures for the individual views (see Figure 1b). Search Search techniques are used to prune the high dimensional pose parameter space (see also <ref> [13] </ref>). We currently use best-first search; we do this because a reasonable initial state can be provided by a prediction component during tracking or by a bootstrapping method at start-up.

One can see that corresponding points lie very close to or on top of the epipolar lines.
