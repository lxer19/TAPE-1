Abstract: This paper presents implementations of genetic algorithms in a tree shape parallel computer architecture. Different levels of parallelism involved in GAs are studied. In addition, basic models for parallel GAs are considered. The tree shape parallel computer system, GAPA (Genetic Algorithm Parallel Accelerator), is described in detail, including architecture and special hardware for GA computations. Mapping studies are given for centralized and distributed GA models. Genetic algorithms are one of the most interesting novel methods for reducing the search effort and time in optimization tasks. The basically simple concept of artificial evolution is very flexible and can be applied to a variety of problems, also for those which are hard to model mathematically. However, applications may represent very different problem domains and therefore the style of the GA may differ significantly from one application to another. In general, GAs are
