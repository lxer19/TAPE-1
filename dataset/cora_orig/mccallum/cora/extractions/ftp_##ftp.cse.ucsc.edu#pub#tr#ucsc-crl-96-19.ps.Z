Abstract: We consider systems with finite sources of requests, multiple servers, and an arbitrary number of preemptive priority classes. The service times and the source idle times are assumed to be exponentially distributed. We present an efficient approach based on marginal state description. The approach allows a recurrent analysis of priority levels where the usage of servers by higher priority requests is accounted for through server vanishing and reappearance rates. We first consider systems with fixed priorities. The method is then extended to cases where sources can issue requests at several priority levels.

More recently, Wagner [10] studied multiple server queues with non preemptive priorities and finite source. <p> This is illustrated by set 7 in Table 1. It has been our experience that this type of inaccuracy is more likely to occur when higher priority classes have longer average service time requirements than lower priority requests (similar to the observation in <ref> [8] </ref>) although this is not systematically so. Also, the errors don't appear to grow as the ratio of mean service times increases; on the contrary, they seem to peak and then vanish.
