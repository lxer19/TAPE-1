Abstract: Consider a tandem queue consisting of two single-server queues in series, with a Poisson arrival process at the first queue and arbitrarily distributed service times, which for any customer are identical in both queues. For this tandem queue, we relate the tail behavior of the sojourn time distribution and the workload distribution at the second queue to that of the (residual) service time distribution. As a by-result, we prove that both the sojourn time distribution and the workload distribution at the second queue are regularly varying at infinity of index 1 if the service time distribution is regularly varying at infinity of index ( &gt; 1). Furthermore, in the latter case we derive a heavy-traffic limit theorem for the sojourn time S (2) at the second queue when the traffic load ae " 1. It states that, for a particular contraction factor (ae), the contracted sojourn time (ae)S (2) converges in

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that the service time distribution has a finite second moment. While the tail behaviour of the waiting time, sojourn time and workload distributions with heavy-tailed service time distributions is presently a hot topic in performance analysis, hardly any network results have been obtained. Anantharam <ref> [1] </ref> and Boxma and Dumas [12] obtain results regarding the propagation of long-range dependence in networks of (fluid) queues.

Reference-contexts: Below we specify this sojourn time tail behaviour (and that of m, G, X and Y ) for the case of a regularly varying service time distribution, a case that presently receives much attention in the literature of communication network performance. We refer to <ref> [4] </ref> for an excellent discussion of regular variation in probability theory. A probability distribution F () of a non-negative random variable is said to be regularly varying at infinity of index if, for all x &gt; 0, (1 F (xt))=(1 F (t)) ! x , t ! 1. <p> It follows from the Karamata theorem and the Monotone Density theorem, see <ref> [4] </ref> Section 1.5.6 and 1.7.3, that PrfB fl &gt; wg w 1 L (w) as w ! 1. The results now follow immediately from (3.3), Lemma's 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and Theorem 4.1. 2 Remark 4.1. <p> Remark 4.2. The Weibull distribution of the previous remark is a subexponential distribution, cf. <ref> [4] </ref>. Pakes [19] has proven for the GI=G=1 queue that, if the residual service time distribution is subexponential, then the tail of the sojourn time distribution is asymptotically equivalent to the tail of the residual service time distribution, up to a multiplicative factor ae=(1 ae). <p> The class of long-tailed distributions contains the class of subex ponential distributions, which in turn contains the class of regularly varying distributions, cf. <ref> [4] </ref>. It is easy to prove that, if PrfB &gt; tg is long-tailed and D is any non-negative random variable that is independent of B, then PrfB D &gt; tg PrfB &gt; tg ! 1 as t ! 1. <p> Proof. Let (ae) be the solution to Equation (6.4) with the property (ae) # 0 for ae " 1. As proved in Lemma 10 in [10], the solution (ae) with such a property is unique. Using Theorem 1.6.1 in <ref> [4] </ref>, it follows from (4.5) that for w &gt; 0, w=ffi 1 w 1 which in combination with the definition of (ae) yields lim w=(ae) Thus, for w &gt; 0, lim Y (w=(ae)) = lim exp w=(ae) ) = expfw 1 g: (6.7) By (6.2), it is easy to get lim <p> w=ffi 1 w 1 which in combination with the definition of (ae) yields lim w=(ae) Thus, for w &gt; 0, lim Y (w=(ae)) = lim exp w=(ae) ) = expfw 1 g: (6.7) By (6.2), it is easy to get lim B (w=(ae)) = 1: (6.8) Applying Theorem 1.6.5 in <ref> [4] </ref>, (4.4) implies that, for w &gt; 0, Z 1 tdB (t) 1 ffi 1 L (w=ffi); ffi # 0; which further implies that lim Z 1 tdB (t) = w 1 : (6.9) Since (3.10) and (6.9) implies that lim ae"1 F (w=(ae)) = 0 where F () is given

Reference-contexts: The tandem system with identical service times at both nodes is interesting for some practical communication nets, as it reflects the situation in which a message retains the same length while being transmitted through various communication channels. The two-node case has been studied in detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. A nice feature of this model is, that it allows explicit expressions for the sojourn time and workload distributions at the second node (without taking recourse to Laplace-Stieltjes transforms). <p> In the present paper, such a heavy-traffic limit theorem is obtained for the sojourn time distribution in Q 2 .

In Section 3 we obtain tail asymptotics for some performance measures for Q 1 . <p> We assume that B () has a finite first moment fi and that the traffic load ae = fi &lt; 1. This ensures <ref> [6] </ref> that steady-state distributions of the sojourn time and workload distributions at both queues exist. <p> From Theorem 6.1 in <ref> [6] </ref> we know that Y (w) = exp w oe 3 Now we turn to the sojourn time distributions. <p> I.e., cf.

Reference-contexts: We can apply this rule to replace PrfB &gt; B fl 1 + wg by PrfB &gt; wg in (5.6). Actually, PrfB &gt; tg is long-tailed implies that PrfB fl &gt; wg is long-tailed by using l'Hospital's rule (but the converse is not true in general, cf. <ref> [17] </ref>). Therefore the second term in the righthand side of (5.6) can be replaced by 2ae PrfB fl &gt; wg.
