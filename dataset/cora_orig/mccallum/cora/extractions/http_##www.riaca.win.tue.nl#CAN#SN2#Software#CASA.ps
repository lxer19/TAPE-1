Abstract: CASA is a special-purpose system for computational algebra and constructive algebraic geometry. The system has been developed since 1990. With its newest version, version 2.3, in May 1997, CASA is the ongoing product of the Computer Algebra group at the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC-Linz), the University of Linz, Austria, under the direction of the second author. The system is built on the kernel of the widely used computer algebra system Maple.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Constructive methods in algebra and algebraic geometry are gaining more and more importance with the availability of computers and computer algebra softwares.
