Title: Less is More: Using Grice's Maxim of Quantity to Generate Instructional Text

Abstract: Plans produced by AI planning systems have the potential to serve as the underlying action representation for systems that generate instructional texts. However, there is more detail in even the simplest of plan data structures than there is in a typically plan description used by people. This paper describes a operational definition of Grice's maxim of quantity that guides the selection of appropriate amounts of detail to appear in a textual description of a plan.

Reference-contexts: Second, one must specify the criterion determining sufficient information for a given conversational context. Finally, one must specify an algorithm that generates an utterance containing just enough information to meet this criterion. Dale and Reiter <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1995) </ref> provide a model of the process of generating referring expressions that characterizes a number of approaches motivated by the maxim of quantity (?; ?). <p> The technique of selecting minimal descriptions using exhaustive search corresponds to Dale and Reiter's full brevity interpretation used in the generation of referring expressions <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1995) </ref>. This approach and three others are discussed below. Generating Candidate Descriptions Grice's maxim of quantity suggests that we make our communication only as informative as is required.

Reference-contexts: In brief, the space of all candidate descriptions is the power set of the source plan; searching this space is intractable. 5 There is evidence, however, that optimal plan descriptions are not required. The results of experiments on the composition and use of written instructional texts by human subjects <ref> (Hull & Wright 1990) </ref> indicate that people often generate non-optimal task descriptions. Furthermore, in cases where non-optimal descriptions are used, readers are still able to carry out the tasks being described.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Several researchers interested in the generation of task-related discourse have employed action representations based on AI plans. The principle work on explaining plans produced by AI planning systems was done by Mellish and Evans <ref> (Mellish & Evans 1989) </ref>. Their system produces a textual description of a plan generated by the NONLIN planner (?). As Mellish and Evans point out, plan data structures contain more information than is typically found in natural descriptions of plans.
