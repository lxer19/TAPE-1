Abstract: In this paper, we study various algorithmic questions regarding the computation of an optimal three finger planar grasp. We present a novel O(n 2 log n)-time algorithm to compute such an optimal grasp for an arbitrary simple n-gon. This algorithm can be used for finding "good" immobilizing sets. We also discuss several variations on the problem and many intriguing open questions in the area that remain unsolved.

Introduction I N robotics and manufacturing, the problem of grasping, fixturing and workholding occupies a central position. While the question of analyzing and synthesizing a closure grasp or a fixture is fairly well-studied (see for instance <ref> [1] </ref>, [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [15], [20], [22]), the question of formalizing a satisfactory notion of a grasp metric, and devising efficient algorithm for synthesizing grasps of good quality has received relatively less attention. <p> In this paper, we explore this problem for two-dimensional polygonal objects with hands of relatively few fingers.

In this paper, we study various algorithmic questions regarding the computation of an optimal three finger planar grasp. We present a novel O (n 2 log n)-time algorithm to compute such an optimal grasp for an arbitrary simple n-gon. <p> It is noteworthy that this algorithm is rather simple to implement and may perform well in practice. For instance, if one performs binary search on the real interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (instead of the possible radii values), then for a random polygon this algorithm can compute in O (n log n log (1=*)) all three finger grasps whose corresponding residual radii lie in the range [, fl ] of size &lt; *, for sufficiently small positive *. D. <p> problem of interest is to study the similar optimality problem in the case of "fixturing," where a polygonal object has to be fixtured by a set of toe-clamps that can be placed only at places designated by a set of toe-slots (which are usually arranged on a regular square grid) <ref> [1] </ref>, [9], [10], [22]. The added difficulty arises because of the geometric constraints imposed by the toe-slots. It is easily seen that for a rectilinear object the optimal fixel (fixture element) placement can be determined in O (n) time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we are interested in computing the "best" immobilizing set for a 3-immobilizable simple polygon. First, we claim that with the positions of the finger as described previously, we can immobilize the polygon. Our claim is a consequence of the following theorem of Czyzow-icz, Stojmenovic and Urrutia <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 1: Three points immobilize a triangle if and only if the normals to the triangle at these points are concurrent. The grasps as described satisfy the required concurrency condition, and the extension of the edges at which grasp 102 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, VOL. XX, NO.

Reference-contexts: A systematic exploration in this direction was initiated in the work of Kirkpatrick, Mishra and Yap <ref> [5] </ref>, where a deep interconnection between the problem of optimal grasp synthesis and certain quantitative versions of Helly-type theorems in combinatorial geometry (namely, quantitative Steinitz's theorem) plays a key role.

A simple linear time algorithm for finding at least one closure grasp for a polygonal object has been presented in <ref> [12] </ref>. However, it remains unclear whether it is possible to efficiently compute the "best" possible closure grasp for a fixed number (say, four or more) of fingers.

Let be the "wrench map" mapping a unit force along the inward-directed normal at p i to the corresponding force and torque in the 3-dimensional "wrench space." (See Mishra et al. <ref> [12] </ref>.) Then (p i ) lie on the xy plane in the wrench space R 3 . For a unit vector n in the xy plane in R 3 , let n ? be the unit vector perpendicular to n and rotated by =2 counter-clockwise.
