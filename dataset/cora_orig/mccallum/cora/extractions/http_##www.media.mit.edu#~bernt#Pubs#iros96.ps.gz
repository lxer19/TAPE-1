Abstract: In [Sch 96c] we have introduced the use of Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms for Probabilistic Object Recognition. In this paper we reverse the object recognition problem by asking the question, "where should we look?", when we want to verify the presence of an object, to track an object or to actively explore a scene. This paper describes the statistical framework from which we obtain a network of salient points for an object. This network of salient points may be used for fixation control in the context of active object recognition.

Reference-contexts: We also examine the robustness of the salient points to scale changes. 2 Probabilistic Object Recognition based on Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms In earlier papers we presented a technique to determine the identity of an object in a scene using multidimensional histograms of local neighborhood operators. We showed <ref> [Sch 96a] </ref> that this technique can be used to determine the most probable object, independent of its position, scale and image-plane rotation. In [Sch 96b] we evaluated the robustness of the approach to image-plane orientation and view points changes. <p> Section 2.2 reviews the use of this technique for probabilistic object recognition. 1 2.1 Local Characteristics based on Gaussian Derivatives Multidimensional receptive field histograms can be constructed using a vector of any linear filter. In <ref> [Sch 96a] </ref> we experimentally compared the invariant properties for a number of receptive field functions, including Gabor filter and local derivative operators. Those experiments showed that Gaussian derivatives provided the most robust and equi-variant recognition results.

Reference-contexts: In [Sch 96b] we evaluated the robustness of the approach to image-plane orientation and view points changes. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach is robust to such changes. In <ref> [Sch 96c] </ref> we extended this technique to probabilistic object recognition. We developed a technique to determine the probability of each object in an image only based on multidimensional receptive field histograms. In the following section 2.1 we describe briefly the local characteristics which will be used throughout the paper. <p> This probability distribution depends not only on the filter combination which is used but also depends on the context of the vision task. Therefore the calculation of the probability distribution p (M k ) needs careful investigation. In <ref> [Sch 96c] </ref> we used the formula p (M k ) = P n p (M k jO n )p (O n ) to calculate the a priori probability of the measurement M k .

A histogram of color vectors provides a statistically sound manner to fuse such features and improve the probability of recognition. Normalising the color information provides a manner to obtain recognition which is robust in the presence of changes of background light conditions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the important questions for fixation control in an active vision system is signified by the phrase "where to look next?" <ref> [Swa 93] </ref>. One can divide the different approaches for this problem into three categories: task driven, context driven and feature driven attention mechanisms. In this paper we propose a new statistical approach to answer the question "where to look next?".

Reference-contexts: It is worth mentioning that this concept can generally be used as an interest point detector. Such interest points of an object or in an image can be e.g. used directly in a geometric hashing approach for object recognition <ref> [Wol 90] </ref>. We also use the interest point detector to find track-able (that is discriminable and easy to detect) points of an object.
