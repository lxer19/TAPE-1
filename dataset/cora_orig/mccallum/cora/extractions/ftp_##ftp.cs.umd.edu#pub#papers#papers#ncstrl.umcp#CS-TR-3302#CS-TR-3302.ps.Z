Abstract: Report CS-TR-3302 UMIACS-TR-94-76 June 1994 Abstract. Discretization of the Stokes equations produces a symmetric indefinite system of linear equations. For stable discretizations, a variety of numerical methods have been proposed that have rates of convergence independent of the mesh size used in the discretization. In this paper, we compare the performance of four such methods: variants of the Uzawa, preconditioned conjugate gradient, preconditioned conjugate residual, and multigrid methods, for solving several two-dimensional model problems. The results indicate that where it is applicable, multigrid with smoothing based on incomplete factorizaton is more efficient than the other methods, but typically by no more than a factor of two. The conjugate residual method has the advantages of being both independent of iteration parameters and widely applicable. Key words. Stokes, multigrid, Krylov subspace, conjugate gradient, conjugate residual, Uzawa

Reference-contexts: For multigrid, we consider versions derived from two smoothing strategies: a variant of the distributed Gauss-Seidel method of Brandt and Dinar <ref> [6] </ref>, and the technique based on incomplete factorization developed by Wittum [35]. 1 These methods all have the property that for appropriate choice of precondition--ers (or for multigrid, smoothers), their convergence rates are independent of the mesh size used in the discretization. <p> The analysis applies to the ILU smoothing of x3.2, although it requires that the prolongation be based on biquadratic interpolation. In practice, bilinear interpolation has been observed to be sufficient [35]. Fourier analysis in <ref> [6] </ref> also suggests that MG/DGS has convergence rate independent of mesh size. Remark 2.1. Several other proposed methods share properties with the version of PCG under consideration. <p> We consider two multigrid smoothing strategies. The first is a variant of the distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) iteration introduced by Brandt and Dinar <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> For P 1 (h)P 1 (h) finite elements, S G is the block Jacobi matrix derived from a two-line ordering of the underlying grid. These are slightly more sophisticated versions of the choice S G = diag (G) used in <ref> [6] </ref>. We refer to this multigrid method as MG/DGS. The other multigrid smoother is the incomplete LU factorization (ILU) presented by Wittum [35]. We use an ILU factorization of the matrix ~ A of (10), with no fill-in in the factors. The ordering for ~ A is problem dependent.

Reference-contexts: The Orthodir version, which uses a three-term recurrence to generate P i , is guaranteed not to break down; it requires two additional axpy's. Our implementation switches from the Orthomin to Orthodir direction update if jff i j &lt; 10 4 , as described in <ref> [9] </ref>. In the experiments discussed in x4, this switch never took place. 5 This is used as the smoother for the multigrid solver for (2). Specific choices for S are given in x3.2. <p> The sizes of the intervals depend on and the accuracy with which Q A approximates A.

Reference-contexts: Discussions of computational costs will be made in terms of various matrix operations together with inner products and "axpy's," i.e., vector operations of the form y ffx + y. 2.1. The inexact Uzawa method. We use the following "inexact" version of the Uzawa algorithm <ref> [11] </ref>, which starts with u 0 j 0 and an arbitrary initial guess p 0 : for i = 0 until convergence, do u i+1 = u i + Q 1 p i+1 = p i + ff Q 1 enddo (4) Here, ff is a scalar parameter that must be <p> This is smallest for the choice ff = 2=( 1 + 2 ), in which case it has the value ( 1)=( + 1). Thus, the convergence factor for the Uzawa algorithm is independent of the mesh. It is shown in <ref> [11] </ref> that the performance of the inexact Uzawa algorithm 6 is close to that of the exact one if the iterate u i+1 satisfies kf B T p i Au i+1 k 2 &lt; o kBu i Cp i k Q 1 ;(14) where o is independent of the mesh size. <p> The coarse grid solution is obtained using Cholesky factorization for the preconditioners and singular value decomposition for the solvers. Remark 3.1. For the Uzawa method, the choice of Q A does not guarantee that the condition (14) is satisfied. The results of <ref> [11, 33] </ref> as well as those of x4 suggest that with multigrid for Q A , (14) may be too stringent. Remark 3.2. The effectiveness of the multigrid solvers depends on the fact that the commutator W in (10) is zero away from the boundary of .

The preconditioned conjugate residual method was developed by Rusten and Winther [24] and Silvester and Wathen <ref> [26, 31] </ref>, and its convergence behavior is determined by properties of the indefinite matrix. <p> As in <ref> [26] </ref>, we use 0 Q M : 2.4. Multigrid. As is well known, multigrid methods combine iterative methods to smooth the error with correction derived from a coarse grid computation. We use V-cycle multigrid for "transformed systems." Our description follows [34, 35]. <p> The constant of proportionality depends on how close j 1 is to j 2 in (3), i.e., how well Q A approximates A. The PCR method is analyzed in <ref> [24, 26] </ref>. The analysis shows that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix Q 1 A are contained in two intervals [a; b] [ [c; d], where a, b, c, are d are positive constants that are independent of the mesh size.

Reference-contexts: The sizes of the intervals depend on and the accuracy with which Q A approximates A. It follows from the convergence analysis of CR <ref> [9, 27] </ref> that the convergence factor for the preconditioned algorithm is independent of the mesh size. For example, it is shown [9] that if d c = a b &gt; 0, then the convergence factor is bounded by 2 p 1+ fi , where fi = (bc)=(ad).

Reference-contexts: For the latter strategies, velocity and pressure unknowns are not separated from one another, see <ref> [28] </ref>. The performances of MG/ILU for all these orderings were very close. For example, for h = 1=32 as in Table 4 below, the smallest average iteration count with one smoothing step was 10 1 3 and the largest was 11 2 3 . 3.3. Iteration costs.

For the three finite element discretizations, Q M is chosen to be the diagonal of the mass matrix M , see <ref> [32] </ref>. (In the case of the P 1 (h)P 0 (2h) discretization, Q M = M .) Although there is no mass matrix for finite differences, a natural analogue in two dimensions is M = h 2 I, and this is used for Q M with finite differences.

Reference-contexts: The coarse grid solution is obtained using Cholesky factorization for the preconditioners and singular value decomposition for the solvers. Remark 3.1. For the Uzawa method, the choice of Q A does not guarantee that the condition (14) is satisfied. The results of <ref> [11, 33] </ref> as well as those of x4 suggest that with multigrid for Q A , (14) may be too stringent. Remark 3.2. The effectiveness of the multigrid solvers depends on the fact that the commutator W in (10) is zero away from the boundary of .

Reference-contexts: For multigrid, we consider versions derived from two smoothing strategies: a variant of the distributed Gauss-Seidel method of Brandt and Dinar [6], and the technique based on incomplete factorization developed by Wittum <ref> [35] </ref>. 1 These methods all have the property that for appropriate choice of precondition--ers (or for multigrid, smoothers), their convergence rates are independent of the mesh size used in the discretization. The actual costs of using them depends on both the convergence rate and the cost per iteration. <p> As in [26], we use 0 Q M : 2.4. Multigrid. As is well known, multigrid methods combine iterative methods to smooth the error with correction derived from a coarse grid computation. We use V-cycle multigrid for "transformed systems." Our description follows <ref> [34, 35] </ref>. Cf. [22, 30] for other multigrid methods derived from the squared system associated with (2). Let p denote the Laplace operator defined on the pressure space, with Neumann boundary conditions (see [16]), and let A p be a discrete approximation to p defined on the pressure grid. <p> The analysis applies to the ILU smoothing of x3.2, although it requires that the prolongation be based on biquadratic interpolation. In practice, bilinear interpolation has been observed to be sufficient <ref> [35] </ref>. Fourier analysis in [6] also suggests that MG/DGS has convergence rate independent of mesh size. Remark 2.1. Several other proposed methods share properties with the version of PCG under consideration. <p> These are slightly more sophisticated versions of the choice S G = diag (G) used in [6]. We refer to this multigrid method as MG/DGS. The other multigrid smoother is the incomplete LU factorization (ILU) presented by Wittum <ref> [35] </ref>. We use an ILU factorization of the matrix ~ A of (10), with no fill-in in the factors. The ordering for ~ A is problem dependent. For finite differences, it is derived from an uncoupled red-black ordering of the underlying grid. <p> We make the following observations on these results. 1. Where it is applicable, multigrid requires the smallest number of iterations and has the smallest convergence factors. MG/ILU is superior to MG/DGS in these measures. These observations agree with those of <ref> [35] </ref>. In addition, where it is applicable, MG/ILU requires the smallest number of operations. However, multigrid is only ef fective for discretizations where velocities and pressures are defined on the same grid. 13 Fig. 2.
