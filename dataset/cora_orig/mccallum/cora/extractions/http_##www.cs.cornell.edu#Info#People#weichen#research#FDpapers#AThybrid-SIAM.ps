Abstract: We present a consensus algorithm that combines unreliable failure detection and randomization, two well-known techniques for solving consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. This hybrid algorithm combines advantages from both approaches: it guarantees deterministic termination if the failure detector is accurate, and probabilistic termination otherwise. In executions with no failures or failure detector mistakes, the most likely ones in practice, consensus is reached in only two asynchronous rounds.
