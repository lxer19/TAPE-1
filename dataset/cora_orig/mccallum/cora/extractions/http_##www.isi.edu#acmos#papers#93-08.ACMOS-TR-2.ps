Abstract: The energy recovery principle used in high-efficiency power supplies can be applied to digital CMOS logic to reduce dynamic power dissipation. We describe experiments with a custom line-driver chip and resonant power supply that can switch eight 100pF loads at 1MHz over 6 times more efficiently than conventional CMOS. The paper describes the adiabatic charging principle underlying this class of designs, which allows trading off switching time for increased energy efficiency. We emphasize the importance of including power supply and control logic overhead in evaluations of the net energy savings, and show how this overhead modifies the time-energy trade-off formula. The effect of non-ideal devices is also investigated.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 gives our conclusions. 2.0 The Principle of Adiabatic Charging The energetics of digital CMOS circuits is described in detail in many textbooks. To review, Figure 1, taken from Glasser and Dobberpuhl <ref> [2] </ref>, is an idealized model of a CMOS inverter, representative of static, restorative or precharged CMOS logic. With the input initially high, the output is zero (C L discharged). When the input switches from high to low, the p-channel FET (pFET) turns on and the n-channel FET (nFET) off.

Reference-contexts: 1.0 Introduction Energy recovery in electronic circuits is a familiar principle in high-efficiency power supply design [1], and has also been used in other electrical engineering domains such as elec-troluminescent displays <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper presents theory and design principles for applying energy recovery techniques to digital CMOS circuits. To gain experience with the benefits and limitations of the approach, we have designed and fabricated an IC line driver chip, called the Adiabatic Line Driver Chip (ALDC).

Reference-contexts: There are myriad ways to apply adiabatic switching to build energy-efficient computing systems, and there have recently been several proposals for building logical switching elements compatible with adiabatic charging <ref> [5] </ref>. A critical issue in evaluating these circuit approaches and our own ACMOS circuits is to include the energy necessary to operate the novel power supply that supports the adiabatic charging process.

Reference-contexts: In this regime, the device can be modeled as a voltage-controlled resistance, as follows for instance from the simple Schichman-Hodges MOS model <ref> [6] </ref>. For an nFET: , (EQ 3) where L is the transistor length, m is the carrier mobility, C is the gate capacitance, V gs is the gate to source voltage, and V th is the threshold voltage. An analogous expression holds for pFETs.

Reference-contexts: The inputs may then change. Violation of this protocol can result in charge stranded on an output node and its associated energy therefore unavailable for reuse. This sequencing imposes an interesting reversibility constraint when applying adiabatics for low-energy dissipation <ref> [7] </ref>. C C L 2 FIGURE 3.
