Reference-contexts: The paper introduces several new insights into the interaction and roles of the different parameters of an evolutionary system. There have been very few attempts to theoretically analyze the dynamics of interaction between the different operators and the performance of GA (e.g. Holland's building blocks and schema [8], <ref> [1] </ref>). The problem of finding the appropriate (and in some cases the optimal) population size have been discussed for certain applications in the GA literature [5]. There has also been research of the role of different selection schemes on GA performance [8].

Reference-contexts: This value for the recombination rate is often used in population genetics literature and allows us to compare our results to those in <ref> [2] </ref> and [3]. Table 1 displays the number of generations to fixation to any point in the search space for three population sizes: 100, 150 and 200 individuals, and six fitness landscapes: for M=1, 6, 10, 13, 16 and 20 .

Reference-contexts: In other words we implement fitness based proportional selection, independent of the fitness values for the rest of the population. 3. Fitness Landscape with Randomly Controlled Ruggedness To control the ruggedness of the fitness landscape we use the same formalism as proposed by Bergman and Feldman 1992 <ref> [3] </ref>, i.e.: F (i) = i ) M where l is the number of loci in the genotype (20 in our case). Y ( x) , x = 1,2, ..., M are random numbers that are uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1] . <p> This value for the recombination rate is often used in population genetics literature and allows us to compare our results to those in [2] and <ref> [3] </ref>. Table 1 displays the number of generations to fixation to any point in the search space for three population sizes: 100, 150 and 200 individuals, and six fitness landscapes: for M=1, 6, 10, 13, 16 and 20 . <p> The question of the role of the recombination is very interesting and we will present some results on that topic in a future publication. This question was extensively discussed for diploid individuals in <ref> [3] </ref>. 4. Theoretical Analysis In this section we will extend our discussion of the role of the shape of the fitness landscapes and derive iterative relationships that describe the dynamics of interaction in our system.

Reference-contexts: The mean , minimum and maximum are taken over the total number of cases -&gt; 100. The standard deviation for all cases in Table 1 and 2 follow the trend of the mean. We also performed c 2 tests (see <ref> [4] </ref>) to analyze the results from all experiments. The tests confirmed the significance of the reported data with respect to the null hypothesis. As we can see from Table 1 the more complicated the fitness function the faster fixation occurs. <p> This relation is similar to the Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection (see <ref> [4] </ref> and [7]). In the GA literature an example of similar analysis is described in [6].

Reference-contexts: This relation is similar to the Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection (see [4] and [7]). In the GA literature an example of similar analysis is described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Using (4) we can express the expected number of individuals with fitness F (s) at generation k , as a function of this number for the initial randomly generated population and the expected average fitness of all generations before k .

Reference-contexts: For each case (i.e. random initial population) this process continues until all the individuals within the same generation have the same genotype - this is the condition for fixation. For statistical test we run each set of input parameter settings for 100 cases. As explained in <ref> [9] </ref> this method of constructing the offspring generation where every member of the new population is added as a result of individual "selection" after application of the genetic operators to the previous generation, is a characteristic of population genetic analysis. <p> Finally we would like to mention that the ruggedness of the fitness function have similar effect as the strength of the selection pressure. If we compare the analysis in Section 3 with the results in <ref> [9] </ref> we can see that both the increase of the ruggedness (larger N ) and the increase of the selection pressure lead to faster fixation and less "wrong" fixation.

Reference-contexts: This result is in accord with the results in population genetics that are due to sampling error. As described in Chapter 5 of <ref> [11] </ref> selection strength has to be above certain value for given population size, in order for the system to overcome the "genetic drift". Genetic drift in that context refers to the sampling error by the gametes - an internal source of chance effects in evolution.
