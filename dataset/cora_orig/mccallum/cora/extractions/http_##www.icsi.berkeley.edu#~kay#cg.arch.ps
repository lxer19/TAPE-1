Title: An Informal Sketch of a Formal Architecture for Construction Grammar  
Author: Paul Kay 
Date: July 16, 1998  
Affiliation: UC Berkeley  
Abstract: A formal architecture for Construction Grammar (CG) is sketched. Modeling domain objects (constructs) are constituent structures with feature structures at the nodes, aka Feature Structure Trees (FTs). Constructions are partial descriptions of FTs, expressed as sets of constituent structure equations and path equations. Unification of constructions is defined. A construct c is licensed by a grammar G iff G contains a set of constructions whose unification fully describes c.
