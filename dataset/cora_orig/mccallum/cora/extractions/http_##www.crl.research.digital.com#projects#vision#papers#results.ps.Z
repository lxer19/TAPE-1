Abstract: Experimental Hand Tracking Results Abstract This document presents graphical output from three hand tracking experiments using the DigitEyes system, excerpted from [1, 2]. In the first of two real-time tracking experiments, a reduced hand model is used to drive a 3D mouse user-interface. In the second, the full hand model is tracked using two cameras. The last experiment demonstrates off-line tracking in the presence of self-occluding motion. from the DigitEyes System
