Reference-contexts: the ease with which users of the system may communicate with the outside world, since many useful types of communication are considered unsafe from the security point of view, and the security they provide is limited since they can only prevent attacks aimed at certain levels of the protocol hierarchy <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Increase the efficiency of downgrading; 3. Increase the efficiency and reliability of sending information from low to high without, and; compro mising security 4.

We list them separately here.
