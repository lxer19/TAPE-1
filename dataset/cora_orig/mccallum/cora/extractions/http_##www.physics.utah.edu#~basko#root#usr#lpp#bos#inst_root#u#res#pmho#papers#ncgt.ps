Abstract: We present a general framework for Matrix theory compactified on a flat quotient space R n =, with a discrete group of Euclidean motions in R n . It generically leads to gauge theory on a noncommutative space. We characterize the resulting noncommutative gauge theory in terms of a projective regular representation of and the associated twisted group algebra.

Reference-contexts: Facts and arguments on the lately discovered string dualities have pointed to the existence of a fundamental quantum theory in eleven dimensional spacetime, called M theory, which underlies all known five perturbative superstring theories <ref> [1] </ref>. A (BFSS) matrix model was proposed in ref. [2] for the microscopic description of M theory in a light-cone frame, in terms of a set of N partons, called D0-branes, on which strings can end.
