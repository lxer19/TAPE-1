Title: Towards Layered Dialogical Agents

Abstract: We present a formalism for the speciflcation of agents within a multiagent system. We characterize agents through a layered architecture with bridge-rules between formal theories, and multiagent systems through dialogical frameworks. We introduce Concurrent Descriptive Dynamic Logic (an extension of Pegel's Concurrent Dynamic Logic) as the speciflcation language to account for the computational interpretation of such multiagent systems. We illustrate our proposal through the description and implementation of a multiagent negotiation environment: the downward-bidding flsh market.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We think of agents as computational entities that exhibit complex rational behaviour when acting within a multiagent system. Such rational behaviour involves several aspects: communicational, epistemic, motivational, etc., that we shall refer to as "cognitive tasks". These cognitive tasks have been thoroughly studied <ref> [23, 18, 10, 9, 3, 17, 2, 24, 8, 21] </ref>, we will try to take advantage of those developments and propose a simple integration model.

Reference-contexts: rules between pairs of agents deflning the global control of the flsh market bidding rounds simply by: = Ad " B 1 " : : : " B n " A 5 Implementation of the example using PVM We have implemented a prototype version of the Fish Market on PVM <ref> [4] </ref>. PVM provides a unifled framework for development of parallel programs, transparently handling all message routing, data conversion and task scheduling across a network of possibly heterogeneous machines. In this prototype the implementation follows closely the intuitive description of the bidding round given above.

Reference-contexts: These languages will contain predicates to represent operators such as Believe, Commit, Know, Declare, etc. Reiflcation of formulae of other such languages, by means of bridge rules, will produce instances of those predicates over terms quoting formulae <ref> [5, 19] </ref>. For instance, the statement that agent i knows the intention of another agent j on ' could be represented as: K i (dI j (d'e)e), where d'e is a term "representing" the formula ', dI j (d'e)e is a term "representing" I j (d'e), and so on.
