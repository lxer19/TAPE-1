Reference-contexts: The LAN Emulation service will be important to the acceptance of ATM, since it provides a simple and easy means for running existing LAN applications in the ATM environment. Networking customers have indicated in recent surveys, including the ATM Forumsponsored McQuillan Consulting survey (June, 1993), <ref> [1] </ref> that coexistence with existing networks and transition to ATM need to be addressed. Likewise, the surveys have concluded that ATM for work group LANs and LAN Emulation Over ATM Specification - Version 1.0 ATM_FORUM 12 LAN backbones are the top planned uses.

Reference-contexts: MAC layer LAN Emulation is defined in such a way that existing bridging methods can be employed, as they are defined today. Note that bridging methods include both Transparent Bridging and Source Routing Bridging <ref> [4] </ref>. 1.1 Purpose of Document This document specifies an implementation agreement for the LAN Emulation Service, including the following: Architectural Framework and Service Interfaces Service Components and Functions Frame Formats Client/Server Protocols and Procedures LAN Emulation Over ATM Specification - Version 1.0 ATM_FORUM 14 1.2 Terminology The following acronyms and terminology

Reference-contexts: This specification defines a MAC service emulation, including encapsulation of MAC frames (user data frames). This approach to LAN emulation provides support for the maximum number of existing applications. The LAN Emulation Service is one of several B-ISDN services <ref> [16] </ref>. LAN Emulation is a specific type of a conversational service for data information. LAN-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS TO BE EMULATED Connectionless Services LAN stations today are able to send data without previously establishing connections. LAN Emulation provides the appearance of such a connectionless service to the participating end systems.
