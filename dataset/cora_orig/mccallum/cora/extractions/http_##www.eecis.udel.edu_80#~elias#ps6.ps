Abstract: We continue our exploration of the capabilities of artificial dendritic trees by using them to construct units that signal the speed and direction of visual targets in space. By applying three different types of synaptic behavior, we demonstrate that it is relatively easy to obtain dendritic tree responses that differentiate direction of movement and encode target speed.

Reference-contexts: Their use in artificial systems requires control over certain key features, in particular dendrite morphology, synaptic location, and synaptic function. The ADT (artificial dendritic tree) <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref> is a hybrid analog/digital circuit with a branching structure like that shown in figure 1a. Synaptic sites are distributed along the branches at the cross points where they enable inward or outward current. A ten-synapse branch section is shown in figure 1b. <p> Primary branches could each give rise to a binary tree of branches with every branch having 32 synapses. The membrane voltage at the soma was computed by a special purpose simulator or sampled directly from VLSI ADT hardware interfaced to a computer <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>. Input to the ADT was supplied by an array of simulated light sensors. When a visual target stimulated a sensor, it delivered a single pulse, turning on a set of synaptic conductances for a programmable duration, typically 50 msec.

Reference-contexts: Here we present work in progress on the responses of ADTs whose synaptic connections with visual sensors were selected according to theoretical considerations, or by the application of genetic algorithms <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref>. METHODS Results were obtained using ADTs with up to sixteen primary branches connected to an equipotential soma. Primary branches could each give rise to a binary tree of branches with every branch having 32 synapses.

Reference-contexts: Uniformly spaced n-channel transistors (lower) enable outward current, producing an inhibitory effect. Some n-channel transistors play the role of silent or shunting inhibitory synapses <ref> (e.g., Shepherd and Koch, 1990) </ref> by having one of their terminals connected to the resting voltage, V rest . Both types of transistors are turned on by an impulse signal applied to their gate terminals and both operate in the triode region.

Reference-contexts: Temporal summation of excitatory inputs alone gave weak selectivity, but in combination with shunting inhibition gave strong selectivity, as predicted by others <ref> (Koch and Poggio, 1987) </ref>. It is worth noting that DS cells in visual systems also vary considerably in their selectivity. Responses in the null direction may range from slight excitation to outright suppression.

Reference-contexts: Such directionally selective (DS) cells fire most to stimuli moving in a preferred direction and least, or not at all, in a null direction, usually opposite to the preferred direction. DS cells exist at several levels of visual processing in the brain (e.g., tectum, cortex) <ref> (Orban, 1991) </ref>, and in some species in the retina also (Wyatt and Daw, 1975). <p> This unit like many in visual systems, exhibits high-pass velocity characteristics <ref> (Orban, 1991) </ref>. DISCUSSION By applying three different kinds of synaptic input to ADTs, we have shown that it is easy to obtain responses that differentiate direction of movement, albeit with varying degrees of selectivity.

Reference-contexts: Null direction movement, in this case toward the soma, gives the greater hyperpolarizing response which overwhelms the subsequent depolarization. Note that the response to a moving pattern of dots would be less selective because the resulting hyperpolarizations and depolarizations tend to cancel <ref> (Torre & Poggio, 1978) </ref>. The substitution of shunting for hyperpolarizing synapses led to connectivity like that of figure 2c, and responses that were strongly selective for movement toward the soma.

In recent years, directional selectivity has attracted interest as a neuronal computing problem that may be understood in terms of membrane biophysics and synaptic physiology (Torre and Poggio, 1978; Grzywacz and Koch, 1987; Koch and Poggio, 1987).
