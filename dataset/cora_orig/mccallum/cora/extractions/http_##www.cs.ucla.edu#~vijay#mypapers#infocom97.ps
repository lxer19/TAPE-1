Abstract: We consider the problem of coordinating access to the various channels of a single-hop WDM network. We present HiPeR-`, a new reservation protocol specifically designed to overcome the potential inefficiencies of operating in environments with non-negligible processing, tuning, and propagation delays. HiPeR-` differs from previous reservation protocols in that each control packet makes reservations for all data packets waiting in a node's queues, thus significantly reducing control overhead. Packets are scheduled for transmission using algorithms that can effectively mask the tuning times. HiPeR-` also uses pipelining to mask processing times and propagation delays. We use Markov chain theory to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the protocol. The stability condition provides insight into the factors affecting the operation of the protocol, such as the degree of load balancing across the various channels, and the quality of the scheduling algorithms. The analysis is fairly general, as it holds for MMBP-like arrival processes with any number of states, and for non-uniform destinations.

Reference-contexts: As described, the protocol is said to have a look-ahead ` = 1, since control information transmitted during the k-th frame is used to construct the (k + 1)-th frame; thus the name HiPeR-1. This protocol falls into the class of gated reservation schemes <ref> [2] </ref>, since only those packets that arrived prior to the beginning of frame k will be transmitted in frame k+1. HiPeR-` does not have a distinct reservation phase. Instead, control packets are transmitted within a frame along with data packets. This is necessary in order to minimize the tuning overhead. <p> Proof. Let D x denote the drift at state x of M 0 . Because of Pake's lemma <ref> [2, 3A.5] </ref>, in order to show that M 0 has a stationary distribution, we only need to show that there exist a state x 0 0 and a scalar ffi &gt; 0 such that: D x ffi; 8 x &gt; x 0 (7) The drift at state x of MC M

The above protocols suffer from two problems. First, the control channel represents an electronic processing bottleneck <ref> [6] </ref> as control information for N packets must be received and processed for each packet transmission and reception. Secondly, all these control channel protocols operate by schedul ing a single packet from each transmitter at a time (typically, the head-of-line packet is the one scheduled for transmission). <p> This packet is scheduled independently of other packets waiting for transmission at the same node. Hence, depending on the protocol, one transmitter or receiver tuning time is incurred for each packet transmission/reception. A protocol that overcomes the processing bottleneck by introducing k &gt; 1 control channels was presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. The main drawback of this protocol, however, is its lack of scalability, as it requires N + k wavelengths. The PROTON protocol [7] can operate with any number of wavelengths, and its design explicitly considers tuning and processing times.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is the most promising technology for bridging the gap between the speed of electronics and the virtually unlimited bandwidth available within the optical medium. One of the candidate WDM architectures for implementing a new generation of high speed communication networks is the single-hop architecture <ref> [9] </ref>. In a single-hop network, both a transmitter at the source and a receiver at the destination must operate on the same wavelength for a successful packet transmission. Thus, the problem of coordinating access to the various wavelengths of the network arises.

Reference-contexts: This is a Bernoulli process whose arrival rate varies according to a two-state Markov chain. It captures the notion of burstiness and the correlation of successive interarrival times, two important characteristics of traffic in high-speed networks. For details on the properties of the 2-MMBP, the reader is referred to <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Also, ff (0) ff i are the arrival rates of the Bernoulli process at states 0 and 1, respectively. We assume that the arrival process to each node i is given by a different 2-MMBP, independent of the arrival processes to other nodes. From <ref> [10] </ref> we obtain the average arrival rate fl i of the i-th 2-MMBP as: fl i = (10) (0) (01) (1) q i + q i We note that fl i is the probability that any slot contains a packet, regardless of the state of the 2-MMBP.

Reference-contexts: Thus, control overhead is significantly reduced, and nodes can use scheduling algorithms that can effectively mask tuning times <ref> [12] </ref>. HiPeR-` also uses pipelining to mask processing times and propagation delays; parameter ` (the look-ahead) of the protocol controls the degree of pipelin-ing. <p> hardware is needed to monitor and access a control channel; (c) it requires tunability only at one end; (d) it ensures that packet transmissions are free of channel and receiver collisions. (e) it schedules multiple packets for transmission by a node on a given channel to mask the tuning latency <ref> [12] </ref> and to keep the control requirements low; (f) it uses pipelining to overlap processing with packet transmissions, and to hide the effects of propagation delay. 3 System and Traffic Model 3.1 Network Model We consider an optical broadcast WDM network with N nodes, each employing one transmitter and one receiver. <p> The authors have recently considered the problem of packet scheduling with tuning latencies in <ref> [12] </ref>. That work expanded upon, and generalized earlier results obtained in [1, 3]. More specifically, we have shown that careful scheduling can mask the effects of arbitrarily long tuning latencies. <p> The key idea is to have each tunable transmitter send a block of packets on each wavelength before switching to the next. Doing so makes it possible to overlap the tuning latency at a node with packet transmissions from other nodes. The main result of <ref> [12] </ref> was a set of new algorithms for constructing near-optimal (and, under certain conditions, optimal) schedules for transmitting a set of traffic demands fa ic g. Quantity a ic represents the number of packets to be transmitted by node i onto channel c . <p> The schedules are such that no collisions ever occur. They are also easy to implement in a high speed environment, since the order in which the various nodes transmit is the same for all channels <ref> [12] </ref>. to channel c . Each node i is assigned a ic contiguous slots for transmitting packets on that channel. These a ic slots are followed by a gap of g ic 0 slots during which no node may transmit on c . <p> This gap may be necessary to ensure that node i + 1 has sufficient time to tune from wavelength c1 before starting transmission on c . However, the algorithms in <ref> [12] </ref> are such that the number of slots in most of the gaps is equal to either zero or a small integer. Thus, the length of the schedule is very close to the lower bound. <p> The operation of HiPeR-` is rather simple: * Each network node periodically sends control packets informing all other nodes about its traffic demands. * Each node has a copy of the packet scheduling algorithm developed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Upon receipt of all control packets transmitted by other nodes, each node independently runs the algorithm to determine at what time slots to transmit its own data packets. <p> Assume that, somehow, each node i has made reservations for a ic data packets on wavelength c , and that these reservations are known to all nodes. Each node independently runs the scheduling algorithm in <ref> [12] </ref> to compute a packet transmission schedule. However, the input to this algorithm is not quantities fa (k) ic g, but rather quantities fa (k) extra slot is for transmitting a control packet. <p> a control packet transmitted in frame k + 1 represents the number of packets that arrived to the c-th queue of node i between time t k (the beginning of transmission of frame k) and time t k+1 (the beginning of 1 One important aspect of the scheduling algorithms in <ref> [12] </ref> is that their running time depends only on system parameters such as the number of nodes and channels, not on the actual frame length. transmission of frame k + 1).

Reference-contexts: fraction of the control channel capacity is needed for reservation messages; the remaining capacity can be used for other purposes, such as network management, synchronization, etc. 5 Performance Analysis An analysis of TDMA schemes in which a node is allocated multiple consecutive slots per frame has been carried out in <ref> [13] </ref>. There, the generating functions of the queue size and of the delay distribution are derived for fairly general arrival processes. The model in [13] assumes a fixed TDMA frame size, with each node receiving a fixed number of slots occupying the same positions in every frame. <p> synchronization, etc. 5 Performance Analysis An analysis of TDMA schemes in which a node is allocated multiple consecutive slots per frame has been carried out in <ref> [13] </ref>.

The model in [13] assumes a fixed TDMA frame size, with each node receiving a fixed number of slots occupying the same positions in every frame. <p> Consequently, the frame size will vary. Furthermore, the scheduling algorithm is run anew for each frame, therefore, the order in which the various nodes transmit may be different in consecutive frames. As a result, the techniques developed in <ref> [13] </ref> are not applicable here. For the same reasons, an exact delay analysis of a system running HiPeR-` appears to be difficult. We note, however, that packet delay is directly related to the frame size.

Reference-contexts: In addition, this protocol has higher processing requirements compared to other protocols, as two control packets must be sent for each data packet: one before its transmission and one after the end of its transmission. FatMAC <ref> [14] </ref> is a reservation protocol that does not require a separate control channel. Instead, all channels operate in cycles, with each cycle consisting of a control and data phase. Reservations are transmitted in the control phase, and the corresponding data packets are sent in the following data phase. <p> Sec ondly, control packets are not transmitted over a separate channel. Reservations are in-band over the same channels used for data. Furthermore, time in the channels is not di vided into distinct reservation and data phases as in FatMAC <ref> [14] </ref>. Exactly when control packets are transmitted will be discussed shortly. The next subsection describes a first version of HiPeR-`.
