Abstract: A family of finite difference schemes for the acoustic wave equation in heterogeneous media is introduced. The precision and computational cost are analyzed in two cases. First, a two layered medium is considered. The order of convergence at the interface is derived for each scheme. Given an a priori accuracy on the solution, the computational cost is studied as a function of the order of accuracy of the finite difference scheme. It is demonstrated that this function has a minimum. The previous results are extended to the case of random media by a numerical study. Similar conclusions about precision and cost are found.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Finite difference schemes for the wave equation have been extensively studied in homogeneous media (cf <ref> [1] </ref>). The error introduced by the numerical procedure is called dispersion (cf [2]). This phenomenon causes different Fourier components of a signal to travel at different speeds and results in a smeared signal.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Finite difference schemes for the wave equation have been extensively studied in homogeneous media (cf [1]). The error introduced by the numerical procedure is called dispersion (cf <ref> [2] </ref>). This phenomenon causes different Fourier components of a signal to travel at different speeds and results in a smeared signal. In heterogeneous media, the effect of the numerical schemes on the reflection and transmission of waves has to be considered. Many authors have studied these properties.

Reference-contexts: Many authors have studied these properties. Cohen and Joly introduced a compact fourth order scheme and studied the order of convergence of the reflection coefficient in a two layered medium (cf <ref> [3] </ref>). Their results demonstrated a discrepancy between the order of convergence of the reflection coefficient, and the order of convergence of the scheme in homogeneous medium. <p> The family of schemes introduced is the extension of their scheme to an arbitrary order in space. These schemes are not equivalent to the compact schemes introduced by Dablain for homogeneous media and by Cohen and Joly for heterogeneous media (cf <ref> [10, 3] </ref>). The discontinuity in the medium arises only in the spatial derivative.

Reference-contexts: Brown also conducted an analysis of a two layered medium and showed that the choice of the interface location in the mesh could increase the order of convergence (cf <ref> [4] </ref>). However, the study of two layered media is not enough. There has been growing interest in wave propagation in very heterogeneous media and its implications on seismology theory and models. Frankel and Clayton established the feasibility of finite difference simulations of wave propagation in random media (cf [5]). <p> We have proved the following proposition: Proposition 2.1 The convergence of the scheme (2.13) at a point of discontinuity of the coefficient a is linear with the space step h. This result is similar to those obtained in <ref> [4] </ref> by Laplace transform or in [11] when no special treatment is applied to the interface. 3 Study in two layered media We now turn to the analysis of the accuracy of higher order schemes for the acoustic wave equation in heterogeneous media.

We consider an average velocity of 1500 m/s, an average density of 1 kg/m and a standard deviation of 10%. To avoid problems with the source, we embed the random medium in a homogeneous matrix with the same average values.

Reference-contexts: This conclusion is similar to the one for homogeneous media which suggests that dispersion is still a major contribution to the error (cf <ref> [12] </ref>). 4 Cost Analysis for a two layered medium We now look for the cheapest scheme in terms of number of operations which fulfills a certain error percentage on the solution. We chose 10 percent of error on the L 2 relative error. <p> Our results are summarized in figure 6.5 and 6.6 for the different dimensions. The important feature to notice is that in 2D and 3D the cost has a minimum for the fourth order scheme. This same observation was done in the analysis of dispersion error in homogeneous media (cf <ref> [12] </ref>). The difference between 1D and 2D or 3D comes from the expression of the cost. In 1D the cost is linear in all of its variables N L , N T and N . In 2D or 3D the cost becomes quadratic or cubic in N .
