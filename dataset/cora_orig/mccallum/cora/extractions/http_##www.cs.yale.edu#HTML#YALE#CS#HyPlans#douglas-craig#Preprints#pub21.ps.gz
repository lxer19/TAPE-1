Abstract: We propose and analyze the error and timing of solvers consisting of both analog and digital circuitry for sparse linear systems of equations. We obtain high speed, but low precision from the analog circuits. We combine this with low speed, but high precision from the digital circuits. The hybrid circuit should be faster than digital circuits alone. As a preconditioner to standard iterative solution methods, the hybrid circuit makes the cost of the preconditioning step negligible. We also apply the hybrid circuit to a standard multilevel algorithm. 1. Introduction. We study a fast equation solver consisting of both analog and

In this section we consider the two level version of the latter (see [3]), and we show how to employ the hybrid, analog/digital methods to it. The two level method for solving the system Ax = f is described as follows: Step 1.

Reference-contexts: More sophisticated digital methods (e.g., conjugate gradients) are faster than Jacobi, but are not usually fully parallelizable. A great deal of research in the past twenty years has been devoted to developing useful preconditioners for (digital) iterative methods (see <ref> [5] </ref>). Generally, an approximation to A is constructed which is close to A (in some sense), but much easier to factor. The corresponding preconditioned iterative method converges faster than the original method, but costs more per iteration.
