Abstract: The aim of this work is to introduce a new scheme to apply Kirchhoff modeling efficiently to a 2-D acoustic model with a free surface and with irregular source and receiver locations. We consider as data all the traveltimes and amplitudes of each ray connecting points below some datum depth and points over this depth. We derive a new expression for the Kirchhoff formula which uses these computed traveltimes and amplitudes only. Given accurate components, the primary reflection seismograms computed via this new approach for the Kirchhoff method is remarkably accurate and less expensive than the usual technique. We also compare Kirchhoff seismograms with those produced from the same model by finite-difference solution of the linearized acoustic wave equation. fl Dept. of Applied Mathematics, State University of Campinas, CP 6065, 13081-970 Campinas (SP), Brazil (lucio@ime.unicamp.br), and visiting member of the Center for Research on Parallel Computation and the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, TX 77251-1892, USA (lucio@rice.edu).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Imaging methods based on high frequency asymptotic approximations of the acoustic Green's function, sometimes called Kirchhoff modeling, are an efficient tool for computing primaries only reflection seismograms ([3], <ref> [4] </ref>). Their popularity relies on the fact that they can produce a seismogram for a fixed time window, using a portion of the avaliable data only, and with a smaller cost than the others classical techniques such as finite-difference solution of the full acoustic wave equation (e.g. [1], [5]).
