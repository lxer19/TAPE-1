Abstract: We introduce observation frames as an extension of ordinary frames. The aim is to give an abstract representation of a mapping from observable predicates to all predicates of a specific system. A full subcategory of the category of observation frames is shown to be dual to the category of T 0 topological spaces. This result extends the Stone duality between the full subcategory of spatial frames and sober spaces. Appropriate notions of filters, prime elements, and morphisms are introduced in order to construct points of observation frames. These notions generalize the standard ones. We also give a propositional logic of observation frames with both infinite conjunctions and disjunctions, just like there is a geometric logic for (ordinary) frames with infinite disjunctions but only finite conjunctions. This theory is then applied to two situations: firstly to upper power spaces, and secondly we restrict the adjunction between the categories of topological spaces and of observation frames in order to obtain dualities for various subcategories of T 0 spaces. These involve non sober spaces.

Following [Smy83], <ref> [Abr87] </ref> and also [Vic89] we see a frame as an (abstract) collection of finitely observable predicates where equivalent observations are identified. Finitely observable predicate are closed under 9 and "and" represented by the arbitrary joins and finite meets.

Reference-contexts: Our framework of observation frames has both arbitrary unions and intersections of open sets. We use an abstract framework where open sets are just elements of a frame. A different approach has been followed by Kwiatkowska et al. in <ref> [AKM93] </ref>. In this approach liveness predicates are interpreted as greatest fixed points of open sets. This interpretation, however, does not coincide with the classical interpretation of the infinitary conjunction. The outline of the paper is as follows. First we introduce observation frames and turn them into a category.

Reference-contexts: Also if one wishes to study fairness or countable nondeterminism then it seems that one has to go beyond sober spaces: one has to consider a category of ! 0 and ! 1 chain complete partial orders with functions preserving least upper bounds of ! 1 chains [Plo82]. In <ref> [BK93] </ref> two of the authors introduced the notion of completely multiplicative predicate transformers. This notion was used in [BK94] for an extension of the results of Smyth [Smy83] from sober to T 0 spaces (considering also lower semi-continuous and Vietoris continuous multifunctions besides the upper semi-continuous ones). <p> In other words, saturated elements may be defined in terms of an arbitrary number of observable predicates, 7 and hence we can think of them as the (abstract) liveness predicates (see [Smy83], [Kwi91] and <ref> [BK93] </ref>). Notice that for an observation frame F .!L, we have that q 2 Q (F .!L) if and only if q = ufa _ j a 2 F & q v a _ g. From right to left is clear.

This notion was used in <ref> [BK94] </ref> for an extension of the results of Smyth [Smy83] from sober to T 0 spaces (considering also lower semi-continuous and Vietoris continuous multifunctions besides the upper semi-continuous ones). For this result frames were used whose elements are open sets of some T 0 space. <p> For this result frames were used whose elements are open sets of some T 0 space. This forms the basis for the investigation below. Usually subsets represent predicates and open sets <ref> [Smy83, Kwi91, BK94] </ref> represent observable predicates. In a more abstract view, a complete lattice represents predicates while a frame represents observable predicates. This leads us to introduce observation frames: they map observable predicates to arbitrary predicates. They are mappings from frames to complete lattices preserving arbitrary joins and finite meets. <p> a monad with unit X ! Q (X) given by x 7!"x and multiplication Q (Q (X)) ! Q (X) by A 7! S We thus extend the definition of upper power space in [Smy83] from topological spaces to observation frames. 25 The following three lemmas were partly present in <ref> [BK94] </ref>. They establish the fundamental role of M-filters in this setting. The first and fundamental step is that upper power spaces can also be described in terms of M-filters. Subsequently this correspondence is refined to compact and complete irreducible saturated elements. 5.1. Lemma. Let F .!L be an observation frame. <p> For a sober space X, there is an order iso-morphism between the the poset (KQ (X); U ) of compact saturated sets and the poset of Scott-open filters F O (X), ordered by inclusion. 2 The following result is a direct consequence of Lemma 5.5 and can be found in <ref> [BK94] </ref>. 5.7. Lemma. Let X be a sober space, Y be a topological space and : (X) ! (Y ) be a Scott continuous function.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 5.2 is of a more fundamental nature than what is normally called the Scott-open filter theorem (see Corollary 5.6 below). The latter is about Scott-open sets F O (X) of a (sober) space X, which are ordinary filters. This theorem is due to Hofmann and Mislove <ref> [HM81] </ref>, and can in our present setting be obtained from the following result. It identifies where one uses the Axiom of Choice and the fact that the space is sober. We sketch the proof for reasons of completeness. It is very similar to Lemma 8.2.2 in [Vic89]. 5.5. Lemma (AC). <p> Contradiction. 2 Finally we obtain the result of Hoffman and Mislove <ref> [HM81] </ref> as a direct consequence of Lemma 5.5 and Lemma 5.2. 5.6.

Reference-contexts: In his thesis Abramsky [Abr87] applied Stone duality to get logics of domains, as used in denotational semantics. He argues that Stone duality is the bridge between denotational and axiomatic semantics. 2 Smyth <ref> [Smy83, Smy92] </ref> generalized the duality between sober spaces and spatial frames by allowing upper semi-continuous multifunctions as morphisms in the category of sober spaces, and by allowing Scott-continuous and finite multiplicative morphisms on spatial frames. <p> In [BK93] two of the authors introduced the notion of completely multiplicative predicate transformers. This notion was used in [BK94] for an extension of the results of Smyth <ref> [Smy83] </ref> from sober to T 0 spaces (considering also lower semi-continuous and Vietoris continuous multifunctions besides the upper semi-continuous ones). For this result frames were used whose elements are open sets of some T 0 space. This forms the basis for the investigation below. <p> For this result frames were used whose elements are open sets of some T 0 space. This forms the basis for the investigation below. Usually subsets represent predicates and open sets <ref> [Smy83, Kwi91, BK94] </ref> represent observable predicates. In a more abstract view, a complete lattice represents predicates while a frame represents observable predicates. This leads us to introduce observation frames: they map observable predicates to arbitrary predicates. They are mappings from frames to complete lattices preserving arbitrary joins and finite meets. <p> Also Vickers [Vic89] and Abramsky [Abr87] view frames as collections of observable predicates. Concerning liveness predicates, Abramsky [Abr87] suggests that one has to look for structures more complicated than the simple lattice of open sets. Liveness predicates can be seen as arbitrary (but according to <ref> [Smy83] </ref> only countable intersections should be considered) intersections of open sets. Our framework of observation frames has both arbitrary unions and intersections of open sets. We use an abstract framework where open sets are just elements of a frame. <p> A complete lattice can be seen as being an (abstract) collection of predicates where equivalent predicates are identified. It is closed under for all 8 and exists 9 via V W . Following <ref> [Smy83] </ref>, [Abr87] and also [Vic89] we see a frame as an (abstract) collection of finitely observable predicates where equivalent observations are identified. Finitely observable predicate are closed under 9 and "and" represented by the arbitrary joins and finite meets. <p> In other words, saturated elements may be defined in terms of an arbitrary number of observable predicates, 7 and hence we can think of them as the (abstract) liveness predicates (see <ref> [Smy83] </ref>, [Kwi91] and [BK93]). Notice that for an observation frame F .!L, we have that q 2 Q (F .!L) if and only if q = ufa _ j a 2 F & q v a _ g. From right to left is clear. <p> Even more, one gets a monad with unit X ! Q (X) given by x 7!"x and multiplication Q (Q (X)) ! Q (X) by A 7! S We thus extend the definition of upper power space in <ref> [Smy83] </ref> from topological spaces to observation frames. 25 The following three lemmas were partly present in [BK94]. They establish the fundamental role of M-filters in this setting. The first and fundamental step is that upper power spaces can also be described in terms of M-filters.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A duality is a correspondence between two mathematical structures involving points and predicates such that isomorphic structures can be identified. Stone <ref> [Sto36] </ref> first found such a duality between topology and logic. He considered ordered sets (representing the syntax of some logical system) and constructed from a boolean algebra a set of points using completely prime filters.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, by using a topology on a set of points he was able to construct a boolean algebra. For certain topological spaces (later called Stone spaces) these constructions give an isomorphism. In a later paper <ref> [Sto37] </ref>, he generalized this correspondence from Stone spaces to spectral spaces and from boolean algebra's to distributive lattices. Hoffman and Keimel [HK72] described this duality in a categorical framework.

Reference-contexts: This leads us to introduce observation frames: they map observable predicates to arbitrary predicates. They are mappings from frames to complete lattices preserving arbitrary joins and finite meets. An example of an observation frame is the embedding of open sets into the power set of points. Also Vickers <ref> [Vic89] </ref> and Abramsky [Abr87] view frames as collections of observable predicates. Concerning liveness predicates, Abramsky [Abr87] suggests that one has to look for structures more complicated than the simple lattice of open sets. <p> In this way we obtain a duality between observation frames and topological spaces. Next we give a logic of observation frames with arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions. This is done by the introduction of M-topological systems, which are a generalization of the topological systems of Vickers <ref> [Vic89] </ref>. Subsequently we elaborate in two directions: firstly we apply the theory to upper power spaces of posets using filter theorems. Secondly we restrict our duality to some subcategories of T 0 spaces. We give a dualities for spaces that are in general non-sober. <p> A complete lattice can be seen as being an (abstract) collection of predicates where equivalent predicates are identified. It is closed under for all 8 and exists 9 via V W . Following [Smy83], [Abr87] and also <ref> [Vic89] </ref> we see a frame as an (abstract) collection of finitely observable predicates where equivalent observations are identified. Finitely observable predicate are closed under 9 and "and" represented by the arbitrary joins and finite meets. <p> But " is order-reflecting, thus a b. Since () _ is also monotone we obtain a b if and only if a _ v b _ . 4 M-Topological Systems Topological systems were introduced by Vickers <ref> [Vic89] </ref> in order to subsume both topological spaces and (ordinary) frames. In a topological system we have a set of subjects (or points) and a set of predicates (or opens) and a satisfaction relation matching the geometric logic (or logic of finite observations). <p> The latter is obtained as comma category (P 1 #Frm op ). Next we show that the adjunction of Theorem 3.24 can be split in two parts: one from topological spaces to M-topological systems and one from M-topological systems to observation frames. We thus have a situation as in <ref> [Vic89] </ref>. We start with the first adjunction. <p> It identifies where one uses the Axiom of Choice and the fact that the space is sober. We sketch the proof for reasons of completeness. It is very similar to Lemma 8.2.2 in <ref> [Vic89] </ref>. 5.5. Lemma (AC). For a sober space X, a Scott-open set F O (X) is an M-filter if and only if it is an ordinary filter. Proof. The (only-if) part is obvious, so we concentrate on the (if) part. Assume a Scott-open filter F O (X).
