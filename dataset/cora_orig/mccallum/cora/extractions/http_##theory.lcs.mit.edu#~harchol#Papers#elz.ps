Reference-contexts: The x axis is log scale. 4 the system and imbalancing occurs, the larger will be the benefits of mi-gration." The problem with this approach is that it eliminates from the performance metrics any benefit that preemptive migration might bestow on short jobs. But in <ref> [HBD96] </ref>, we show that the most significant impact of preemptive migration is on short jobs. <p> In <ref> [HBD96] </ref> we observed that short jobs are the primary beneficiaries of preemptive migration; thus ELZ ignore what we find to be a major benefit of preemptive migration | its effect on the short jobs. * ELZ use a workload description that includes a majority of jobs with zero lifetime.

Reference-contexts: In our simulation studies we found that the extreme case of optimal local scheduling (executing the job with the shortest remaining lifetime) all but eliminates the need for migration, either preemptive or non-preemptive. <ref> [LO86] </ref> make a similar observation: "... the relative improvement from [preemptive migration] becomes more pronounced as the local scheduling policies become worse." The reason for this effect is that under processor-sharing or round-robin scheduling, long-running jobs can impose slowdowns on many shorter jobs.
