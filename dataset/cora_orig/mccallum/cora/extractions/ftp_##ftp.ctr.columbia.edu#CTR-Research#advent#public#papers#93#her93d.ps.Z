Abstract: We examine the question of how to construct time-varying filter banks in the most general M -channel non-orthogonal case. We show that by associating with both analysis and synthesis operators a set of boundary filters, it is possible to make the analysis structure vary arbitrarily in time, and yet reconstruct the input with a similarly time-varying synthesis section. There is no redundancy or distortion introduced. This gives a solution to the problem of applying filter banks to finite length signals; it suffices to apply the boundary filters at the beginning and end of the signal segment. This also allows the construction of orthogonal and non-orthogonal bases with essentially any prescribed time and frequency localization, but which, nonetheless, are based on structures with efficient filter bank implementations.

The design of filter banks is by now reasonably well understood, at least in the case where infinite signals are assumed, and the analysis does not change over time.

This is the approach used for example in <ref> [4, 1, 3, 9] </ref>. While this works well in the stationary case, it is not so easily applied to the time-varying case, since the z-transform is used for systems which are linear time-invariant or, at worst, periodically time-varying.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we extend those results to show how the boundary filters may be constructed for the most general case of M -channel non-orthogonal filter banks. This allows time-varying analysis, leading to bases which tile the time-frequency plane in an essentially arbitrary way <ref> [7] </ref>, and to the application of filter banks to finite length signals in a straightforward way. Before beginning, we summarize the notation and recall a few elementary facts from Linear Algebra. Boldface lower case letters will denote vectors, and boldface uppercase ones will denote matrices. <p> The problem of time-varying filter banks has been addressed only recently. In [13] an approach is developed, which gives time-varying structures with negligible reconstruction error.

In <ref> [25, 7] </ref> a fast "doubletree" algorithm, which finds jointly binary frequency and time segmentations of a signal is given. 3.2 Changing the filters The fact that we can apply filter banks to finite length signal segments opens some flexibility in the analysis we can perform. <p> For signals that are non-stationary it is to be expected that varying the tree as the signal varies holds some promise for compression. An approach using binary splits in time and frequency is given in <ref> [25, 7] </ref> where a fast algorithm to find a joint time-frequency segmentation is given. The application of this approach to image compression has yielded excellent results [27].

Reference-contexts: While the result is somewhat technical the applications are eminently practical. It provides an alternative to the signal extension methods which are usually used <ref> [18, 19, 20] </ref>. This works for any FIR perfect reconstruction filter bank; restriction to the cases where the filters are orthogonal or linear phase is not necessary. <p> This facilitates the application of subband coding to finite length signals without redundancy or distortion. Previous techniques to address this problem <ref> [18, 19] </ref> generally extended the signal periodically to make it infinite, and then applied time-invariant filtering to the periodic signal. In [19] it was shown that if the filters were symmetric, then non-redundant 15 perfect reconstruction was also possible. <p> Thus, within the structure of the filter bank scheme, we can create bases with arbitrary time-frequency localization. Remarks: 1. The extension methods used to apply filter banks to finite length signals <ref> [18, 19] </ref> could not of course be used to implement time-varying tree structures in real-time; this is a significant advantage of the boundary filter approach. 2. <p> It has been known for some time that it is possible to apply filter banks to finite length signals at the cost of some redundancy (e.g., using zero-padding or boundary value replication) or some distortion (e.g., using truncation) <ref> [18] </ref>. Imposing symmetry on the filters this 22 can be overcome in the two-channel case using the extension methods [19].

Reference-contexts: While the result is somewhat technical the applications are eminently practical.

Reference-contexts: The former property represents a degree of flexibility in our solutions not present in those in <ref> [21] </ref>. Of course, if the signal length, N , is not a multiple of M then we are forced to either accept some redundancy (if we want kM boundary filters at each end) or a lesser number of boundary filters (if we want a critically sampled system).

Reference-contexts: Since U l is in this case a function of 6 5=2 = 15 angles we can attempt to make the response of the system as close as possible to the ideal 3-channel response. This was done using the unconstrained optimization routine in <ref> [22] </ref>. In Figure 3 we show the magnitude response of the boundary filters, and for comparison purposes those of the original filters. <p> In this case Algorithm 2.1 is nothing more than the Gram-Schmidt procedure for orthogonalizing a set of vectors [12, 6, 5]. As we have stated, the implementation in this case is a great deal simpler. To emphasize this fact a Matlab <ref> [22] </ref> routine to calculate the boundary filters is given in in directory /proj/ftp/CTR-Research/advent/public/software/matlab. Routines to do optimization of the boundary filters, as in Example 2.1, is also available. 4. In Example 2.1 we optimized the boundary filters using the same criteria as the original filters, i.e., frequency selectivity.

Reference-contexts: While this makes the operations symbolically clear, in practice more efficient implementations are used. For the "shift invariant" part of the finite length operator (i.e., H t and G t ) the usual efficient filter bank methods can be used <ref> [23] </ref>; at the edges, inner products have to be used to evaluate the boundary filter outputs. 2. Determining the dimension of the left and right nullspaces of G t and H t is easily done empirically.

In Example 2.1 we optimized the boundary filters using the same criteria as the original filters, i.e., frequency selectivity. In <ref> [24] </ref> a 2-channel system was designed such that the lowpass channel preserves polynomial terms less than some fixed degree; it is not possible to preserve polynomials to the same degree at the boundary, but the limits of what is possible are explored in [17]. 17 3 Time-varying tree structures We have <p> In the two-channel non-time-varying case there is a strong connection between the construction of discrete-time bases (filter banks) and continuous-time ones (wavelets) <ref> [24] </ref>. In the time-varying case it is also possible to use two-channel filter banks to derive time-varying wavelet bases and bases for interval regions [17, 6].

Reference-contexts: Having the freedom to change a filter bank tree in real-time may not be of much use unless the freedom can be used in some intelligent way for the application in hand. In <ref> [25, 7] </ref> a fast "doubletree" algorithm, which finds jointly binary frequency and time segmentations of a signal is given. 3.2 Changing the filters The fact that we can apply filter banks to finite length signal segments opens some flexibility in the analysis we can perform. <p> For signals that are non-stationary it is to be expected that varying the tree as the signal varies holds some promise for compression. An approach using binary splits in time and frequency is given in <ref> [25, 7] </ref> where a fast algorithm to find a joint time-frequency segmentation is given. The application of this approach to image compression has yielded excellent results [27].

Reference-contexts: For example, we can process different segments of the signal with different kinds of analysis. Suppose we wish to switch from a filter set that has good frequency selectivity to one that has a good step response as suggested in <ref> [26] </ref>; this is easily achieved by applying the right boundary filters to the filter set to be terminated, and the left boundary filters to the set to replace them.

Reference-contexts: The contribution of our approach is that we show how to handle the boundaries, but at a cost that is advantageous with respect to all of the other available methods. It is well known that filter bank solutions can also be used for the dual multiplexing problem <ref> [28] </ref>. Here at the transmitter we wish to multiplex several signals onto a single channel, and at the receiver we decompose to reconstruct the separate signals. This merely involves interchanging the roles of the analysis and synthesis operators.
