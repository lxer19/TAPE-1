Title: NON-CONSTITUENT COORDINATION: THEORY AND PRACTICE

Abstract: Despite the large amount of theoretical work done on non-constituent coordination during the last two decades, many computational systems still treat coordination using adapted parsing strategies, in a similar fashion to the SYSCONJ system developed for ATNs. This paper reviews the theoretical literature, and shows why many of the theoretical accounts actually have worse coverage than accounts based on processing. Finally, it shows how processing accounts can be described formally and declaratively in terms of Dynamic Grammars.

Reference-contexts: There have been two main approaches to dealing with examples such as (a) using phrasal coordination. The first is to introduce an explicit product operator (e.g. Wood 1988), allowing types of the form NPflNP. The second is to use a calculus in which types can undergo `type-raising' <ref> (e.g. Dowty 1988) </ref>, or can be formed by abstraction (as in the Lambek Calculus, Lambek 1958). The effect is to treat Fred a book as a verb phrase missing its verb. 3 Sag et al. also suggest an alternative treatment using an apparently otherwise unmotivated grammar rule AdvP ! PP.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for this example, any substring of the sentence 1 can form a viable conjunct. DELETION ACCOUNTS In the last twenty to thirty years there have been a series of accounts of coordination involving various deletion mechanisms <ref> (from e.g. Gleitman, 1965 to van Oirsouw, 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is the move made by Goodall (1987), who advocates treating coordination as a union of phrase markers: "a `pasting together' one on top of the other of two trees, with any identical nodes merging together" <ref> (Goodall, 1987, p.20) </ref>. We can visualise the result in terms of a three-dimensional tree structure, where the merged material is on one plane, and the syntax trees for each conjunct are on two other planes. For example, consider the 3-D tree for example (17a) given in Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: For example, Milward (1992b) provides a dynamic description of a shift reduce parser, and a dynamic description of a fully incremental parser based on dependency grammar. Suitable languages for dynamics are both formal and declarative, and are therefore also appropriate to express linguistic gener- alisations. In a Dynamic Grammar <ref> (Milward 1992b) </ref>, each word is regarded as an action which performs some change in the syntactic and semantic context.

Reference-contexts: This lack of distinction as to whether one or more modifier is expected is actually a necessary prerequisite for performing decidable fully word-by-word incremental interpretation <ref> (see Milward and Cooper, 1994, in these proceedings) </ref>. Some of the problems with categorial grammar accounts of coordination do reoccur with a dynamic account based on the parser used in Milward (1992a).

Reference-contexts: The conjuncts retain separate planes (denoted here by using dotted and dashed lines respectively). Goodall's account does not deal with examples such as (17b), which he argues to be examples of a different phenomenon. However these can be incorporated into a 3-D account <ref> (e.g. Moltmann, 1992) </ref>. There are various technical difficulties with Goodall's account (see e.g. van Oirsouw, 1987, and Moltmann, 1992). There is also a fundamental problem concerning semantic interpretation of coordinated structures (see Moltmann, 1992 which provides a revised and more complex 3-D account based on Muadz, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Phrasal coordination is exemplified by the schema 2 : X ! X Conj X 2 There have been various arguments <ref> (stemming from Ross 1967) </ref> for the adoption of a variant of this schema, in which the coordinating conjunctions is associated solely with the last conjunct.

Reference-contexts: However, they may well be constituents in other grammars. For example, it has been argued that the weaker notion of constituency provided by Categorial Grammars is exactly what is required to allow all conjuncts to be treated as constituents <ref> (Steedman 1985) </ref>. Phrasal coordination is exemplified by the schema 2 : X ! X Conj X 2 There have been various arguments (stemming from Ross 1967) for the adoption of a variant of this schema, in which the coordinating conjunctions is associated solely with the last conjunct.
