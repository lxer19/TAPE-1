Abstract: One of the most important uses of agent models is for problem-solving coordination. Coordination has been defined as managing the interdependencies between activities, or pragmatically as choosing, ordering, and locating actions in time in an attempt to maximize a possibly changing set of decision criteria. Coordination activities include not only localized agent interactions over specific problems, but also longer-term agent organizations that can support current and future problem-solving activity. Models that support coordination can be divided into three classes: models of other agents' current intended actions, schedules, and/or plans; models of other agents' objectives (desires, goals); and models of other agents' capabilities. This paper will focus on the longer-term models of capabilities that agents need in order to organize effectively to solve problems. Such models deal with an agent's capabilities and long-term commitments to certain classes of actions. Besides discussing the models themselves, we will discuss the basic behaviors agents should use to construct, communicate, and update these models. Finally, we will discuss how these models can support several different organizational forms such as economic markets, Wiederholdian federations, and bureaucratic functional units. The work will be presented in the context of an implemented agent architecture for Internet information gathering in dynamic domains such as financial portfolio management (called WARREN).

Reference-contexts: We will then discuss the ADVERTISE performative and an extensible agent capability model, itself based on KQML. Communicative Acts and Parameters Rather than either discussing (and reasoning about) every per-formative individually, we can group them (as suggested by speech act theory and <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1995) </ref>) into three classes: assertives (TELL, REPLY, ERROR, ADVERTISE (explicitly) . . . ), directives (ASK-ONE, ASK-ALL, STREAM-ALL, MONITOR, ACHIEVE . . . ), and commisives (ADVERTISE (implicitly), but perhaps some day things like COMMIT, PROPOSE, AGREE, POSTPONE, ACCEPT-ROLE, JOIN-ORGANIZATION, etc.) An interesting attribute of KQML is that

Reference-contexts: For example, in the tactical air domain the doctrine of the various combatants, and the physical capabilities of the aircraft, become a constraint on potential actions and objectives (compare also limited vehicle velocity, acceleration, and turning radii in the DVMT <ref> (Corkill, Lesser, & Hudlicka 1982) </ref>). Some conversational models take into account limited human short-term memory (thus causing reminder-utterances to be produced) (Walker 1994).

Reference-contexts: An important focus of our current (Williamson, Decker, & Sycara 1996) and earlier work <ref> (Decker & Lesser 1993) </ref> is that control relationships are derivative of other, more basic relationships such as required information flows, effects of one task on the duration or result quality of another, etc.

Reference-contexts: Some conversational models take into account limited human short-term memory (thus causing reminder-utterances to be produced) (Walker 1994). Some models of non-local schedules and plans include capability information (e.g., that agent 1 can execute an action twice as fast as agent 2) <ref> (Decker & Lesser 1995) </ref>. The major issue addressed by this paper is how to represent the capabilities of information agents in a way that can be utilized for various organizational and plan-coordination purposes. Furthermore, our solution is constrained by our chosen application domain, open system multi-agent information gathering.

Reference-contexts: The planner fleshes out these more basic relationships; the agent's scheduler uses this information to produce a schedule (or schedules in a dynamic multi-criteria decision-making situation <ref> (Garvey, Humphrey, & Lesser 1993) </ref>) that selects, orders, and locates in time specific instantiated actions. More information on the planner and this formalism can be found in (Williamson, Decker, & Sycara 1996).

Reference-contexts: Different organizational forms can better provide some of these characteristics. For example, market coordination mechanisms <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref> can provide better load balancing as well as more sophisticated services that cannot be provided for free. One way to implement this is to more carefully peruse the list of potential agents returned by the matchmaker query, paying attention to the pricing and reliability information.

Reference-contexts: The task structure is expressed in a hierarchical task network planning formalism developed for information gathering agents that focuses on representing the information flow in a plan, and allows the representation of sophisticated control relationships (such as loops and periodic 4 actions). An important focus of our current <ref> (Williamson, Decker, & Sycara 1996) </ref> and earlier work (Decker & Lesser 1993) is that control relationships are derivative of other, more basic relationships such as required information flows, effects of one task on the duration or result quality of another, etc. <p> More information on the planner and this formalism can be found in <ref> (Williamson, Decker, & Sycara 1996) </ref>. The three actions Make Advertisement, Get Matchmaker Name, and the topmost instance of SendKQML are involved in sending the advertising message.
