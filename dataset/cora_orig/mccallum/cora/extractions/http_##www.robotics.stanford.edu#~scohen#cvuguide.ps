Reference-contexts: It is written in C, and based on two older ODE solvers written in Fortran. Fortran solvers for ODE initial value problems are widespread and heavily used. Two solvers that have been written at LLNL in recent years are VODE <ref> [1] </ref> and VODPK [3]. VODE is a general purpose solver that includes methods for stiff and nonstiff systems, and in the stiff case uses direct methods (full or banded) for the solution of the linear systems that arise at each implicit step.

Reference-contexts: VODPK is a powerful tool for large stiff systems because it combines established methods for stiff integration, nonlinear iteration, and Krylov (linear) iteration with a problem-specific treatment of the dominant source of stiffness, in the form of the user-supplied preconditioner matrix <ref> [2] </ref>. The capabilities of both VODE and VODPK have been combined in the C-language package CVODE. In addition to translating the VODE and VODPK algorithms into C, we have reorganized the overall algorithm considerably.

Reference-contexts: VODE is a general purpose solver that includes methods for stiff and nonstiff systems, and in the stiff case uses direct methods (full or banded) for the solution of the linear systems that arise at each implicit step. Externally, VODE is very similar to the well known solver LSODE <ref> [4] </ref>. VODPK is a variant of VODE that uses a preconditioned Krylov (iterative) method for the solution of the linear systems.
