Title: Projections as Concepts

Abstract: What do the first concepts look like? I propose that the earliest concepts learned by infants are abstractions of activities. The semantics of these concepts are predictive|a good abstraction is one that will help the infant predict reward. This idea has been implemented in several programs, in particular, as fluents in the Baby simulator and preimages in Coelho and Gru-pen's robotics work. Additional examples and a longer version of this paper can be found at http://eksl-www.cs.umass.edu /research/conceptual-systems/index.html One of the great mysteries of human development is how a sensorimotor neonate becomes a thinking child. Piaget documented the stages of infancy that lead to conceptual knowledge and he sketched mechanisms|assimilation and accommodation|that drive development [13]. Today his account is challenged partly because assimilation and accommodation are mechanisms only in a very weak and general sense, a bit like saying, "to win football games you should move the ball downfield." Today scientists have a higher standard: It should be possible to implement the process by which a sensorimotor agent becomes a conceptual agent in a robot, and test the predictions of this model in human infants. This is what my colleagues and I are trying to do. It should be possible to explain the emergence of particular categories and concepts, and not others, from sensorimotor interaction with the environment. Ultimately we seek conceptual underpinnings for higher cognitive functions such as planning and language. What is the primitive stuff out of which concepts develop? Nativists give one kind of answer, empiricists another (the full paper reviews several approaches to the question, particularly those of Piaget [13], E. Gibson [7], Spelke [15], Carey [2], Baillargeon [1], J. Mandler [11.12], M. Johnson [8], Drescher [6], and Lakoff [9,10]). Here, I give a simple account of conceptual primitives as projections of experience. An ideal candidate for a conceptual primitive would be something that is just a small step away from sensorimotor experience, yet is an abstraction of experience (concepts are abstractions). If we regard experiences as trajectories through a space S of very high dimension, then experiences may be similar or different in many ways, each corresponding to a projection of S. The process of abstraction that produces concepts is identical with finding a projection of S; they are different ways of talking about the same thing. The criterion for a good abstraction (projection) is predictiveness, thus concepts have a well-defined semantics: the meaning of a concept is what it entails or predicts about what may be experienced, next. One sees immediately the relationship between concepts and attention: If experience is a trajectory through a high dimensional space, and if concepts are projections of the space, then a concept selects aspects of experience (called the scope of the concept) and thus "conceptual thought" involves attending to those aspects of S within the scope of a concept. Our challenge has been to build programs that acquire concepts|that is, abstractions of experience with predictive semantics|by interacting with the world, and we are trying hard to be stingy with the innate endowment. I'll illustrate our work by describing two projects, from my lab and from the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics at the University of Massachusetts. The full paper will elaborate on these examples. The Babyworld simulator contains a highly stylized "baby" with eyes, ears, a mouth, one arm and no legs [4,5]. Baby's experience is implemented in 26 streams which code what it's seeing, hearing, and mouthing, as well as internal states such as hunger, pain and alertness. Some streams code for initiating action (e.g., DO-ARM) and others code for the action itself (ARM move...). Baby's
