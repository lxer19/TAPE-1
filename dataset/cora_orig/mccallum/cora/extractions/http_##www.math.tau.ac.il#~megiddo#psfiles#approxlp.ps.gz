Abstract: M. Serna recently proved that approximating linear programming is log-space complete for P. This note shows a direct reduction of the exact problem to Serna's approximate one. Consider the problem: given A 2 Z mfin and b 2 Z m , decide whether D = fx 2 Q n jAx b; x 0g 6= ;. If D 6= ;, then there exists an x 2 D such that x 2 L e, where L is the length of the input, and e = (1; . . . ; 1) T 2 Z n (see, e.g., [ 1 ] ). Consider the problem: Since (x; t) = 0 is feasible in (P ), the latter must have an optimal solution (x 0 ; t 0 ). It is easy to see that D 6= ; iff t 0 &gt; 0, since D 6= ; implies the existence of an x 2 D such that x 2 L e, hence t 0 = 1, and if t 0 &gt; 0 then x 0 =t 0 2 D. Serna's problem [ 2 ] calls for finding a t such that t 0 t *t 0 , but this means t &gt; 0 iff t 0 &gt; 0, so this problem is as hard as the exact one. Moreover, for any * &gt; 0 and p 1, the other approximate problem of finding (x; t) such that k(x 0 ; t 0 )k p k(x; t)k p *k(x 0 ; t 0 )k p (see [ 2 ] ) is also as hard as the exact problem, since k(x; t)k p &gt; 0 , k(x 0 ; t 0 )k p &gt; 0 , t 0 &gt; 0 :
