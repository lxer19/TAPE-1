Reference-contexts: It follows from the above-mentioned Courcelle's result that every CMS-definable set of partial k-trees is recognizable in linear time by a corresponding tree automaton. (In <ref> [1] </ref>, the explicit construction of a tree automaton for a given CMS-formula is presented.) This is particularly interesting since many NP-complete problems on graphs can be described as properties expressible in MS, and therefore these problems become linear-time solvable on the class of partial k-trees. <p> minimum (with respect to p ) vertex in the set V p n B 0 i1 .

Thus we have the lemma. Lemma 3.1.25 For G p and p as above, p is a k-generative linear order on G p .

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [4] </ref> and [7], a formalism different from MS-definability is proposed so that the properties expressible using this formalism can be solved in linear time on recursively defined families of graphs.

Reference-contexts: Since the size of each node in such tree-decompositions is bounded, to check if a partial k-tree (given with its tree-decomposition) is recognized takes linear time. Bodlaender <ref> [5] </ref> gave a linear-time algorithm for constructing tree-decompositions of tree-width at most k for partial k-trees. Thus it is possible to check in linear time whether a partial k-tree is recognized, even if its tree-decomposition is not part of the input.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In 1960, Buchi <ref> [8] </ref> showed that a language is regular iff it is definable by some formula in monadic second-order logic (MS). Here, MS is the extension of the first-order logic that allows quantification over sets of objects. <p> That family is recognizable by a DFA A = (; Q; ffi; q 0 ; F ) iff L (A) = fff (G c )jG c 2 G c g. Theorem 2.4.1 (Buchi <ref> [8] </ref>) A language over is recognizable iff it is MS-definable. We only give a proof of the first part (i.e., that of recognizability implying MS-defin-ability), since that is what we want to prove for the case of partial k-paths.

Reference-contexts: Our results rely upon the possibility to MS-define a certain partial ordering on the set of vertices of a given partial k-path. In this respect, it is interesting to note some similarities between our approach and that of Courcelle in <ref> [9] </ref>. (Our results were obtained completely independently.) In his paper, Courcelle was able to MS-define a linear ordering on the vertex-set of a k-connected partial k-path G that corresponds to the order in which those vertices are added to some k-decomposition of G (i.e., a k-generative linear order on G).

Reference-contexts: They are also logical structures since any graph is completely determined by the set of its vertices and the adjacency relation on this set. Thus the notions of recognizability and definability can be extended to finite graphs. Courcelle <ref> [10] </ref> proved that every MS-definable set of finite graphs is recognizable, but not conversely. However, he was able to extend the result of Doner to unordered unbounded trees using a counting monadic second-order logic (CMS), an extension of MS that allows modular counting. <p> This theory of G is decidable if it is recursive (i.e., there is an algorithm that decides whether any given MS-formula holds for all the elements of G). Courcelle showed in <ref> [10] </ref> that the MS-theory of the class of partial k-trees is decidable. Seese [20] proved that if the MS-theory of a class of finite graphs M is decidable, then the graphs in M have uniformly bounded tree-width. Thus, tree-width "characterizes" classes of finite graphs having decidable MS-theories. <p> Definition 2.2.5 The class of L m2 (K)-formulas is the extension of the class of L 1 (K)- formulas by allowing the atomic formulas v 2 V as well as quantification over set variables. Counting monadic second-order logic (CMS) was defined by Courcelle <ref> [10] </ref> as the extension of MS by the unary predicate symbols mod p;q (p &lt; q are non-negative integers), with the intended meaning: mod p;q (V) = True iff jSj = p mod q, where S is the set denoted by the set variable V. <p> Fact 2.2.9 (Courcelle <ref> [10] </ref>) Let ae be a binary relation over the domain D of a -structure K. If ae is MS-definable over K, then so is its reflexive and transitive closure ae fl .

Reference-contexts: Seese [20] proved that if the MS-theory of a class of finite graphs M is decidable, then the graphs in M have uniformly bounded tree-width. Thus, tree-width "characterizes" classes of finite graphs having decidable MS-theories. Courcelle <ref> [11] </ref> showed that a recognizable set of partial k-trees is CMS-definable for k = 1 and k = 2, and conjectured that recognizability implies CMS-definability of partial k-trees for an arbitrary k. Kaller [17] proved the case of k = 3 and the case of k-connected partial k-trees. <p> : : : ; X n v ; Y 1 ; : : : ; Y n e ) ^ (X 1 ; : : :; X n v ; Y 1 ; : : :; Y n e ): The following definitions are similar to those given by Courcelle <ref> [11] </ref> for describing definable graph transductions.

If ae is CMS-definable, then the quotient graph G=ae is CMS-definable in terms of G. Proof. First we show that G=ae is CMS-colourable in terms of G.

Reference-contexts: Robertson and Seymour [18] proved that every minor-closed family of finite graphs can be characterized by a finite set of obstructions, graphs outside the family. Using the fact that the class of partial k-trees is minor-closed, Courcelle <ref> [12] </ref> proved that this class is MS-definable. However, to construct the corresponding MS-formula, one needs to know the finite set of obstructions of the corresponding class of graphs. These sets are known only for k = 1, k = 2 ([21, 2]), and k = 3 ([3]). <p> On the other hand, the obstruction set of the class of partial k-trees can be determined from the MS-formula defining that class. To find such a set, one can use graph grammars (as suggested in <ref> [12] </ref>) or congruences of finite index (see [14]). This reasoning also applies to the class of partial k-paths. In this thesis, we describe how to construct the MS-formula defining the class of partial k-paths for every given k.

Reference-contexts: Here, MS is the extension of the first-order logic that allows quantification over sets of objects. A set of objects is definable by an MS-formula if the formula is true exactly on the members of the set. Thus Buchi established that recognizability is equivalent to MS-definability for words. Doner <ref> [13] </ref> then extended this result to ranked trees (tree representations of algebraic terms). A regular set of ranked trees is recognizable by a tree automaton, the extension of a finite automaton to algebraic terms.

In this thesis, we describe how to construct the MS-formula defining the class of partial k-paths for every given k. As a consequence, we can now compute the obstruction sets of the classes of partial k-paths for each k.

Courcelle [11] showed that a recognizable set of partial k-trees is CMS-definable for k = 1 and k = 2, and conjectured that recognizability implies CMS-definability of partial k-trees for an arbitrary k.

Reference-contexts: A graph H is a minor of a graph G if H becomes a subgraph of G after a series of contractions of edges of G. A family of graphs is minor-closed if every minor of every member of that family also belongs to the family. Robertson and Seymour <ref> [18] </ref> proved that every minor-closed family of finite graphs can be characterized by a finite set of obstructions, graphs outside the family. Using the fact that the class of partial k-trees is minor-closed, Courcelle [12] proved that this class is MS-definable.

Reference-contexts: The question remained whether there was a sufficiently large class of graphs for which recognizability would imply CMS-definability. In their study of graph minors, Robertson and Seymour <ref> [19] </ref> introduced the notion of the tree-width of a graph. A graph of tree-width k exhibits certain tree-like structure: Such a graph can be decomposed into subgraphs of size k + 1 arranged as nodes of a tree (tree-decomposition) so that the nodes containing a given vertex form a subtree. <p> Definition 2.1.5 [Robertson and Seymour <ref> [19] </ref>] A path-decomposition of a graph G = (V; E) is a sequence of vertex-subsets (called bags ) B = hB 1 ; : : : ; B m i such that CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: This theory of G is decidable if it is recursive (i.e., there is an algorithm that decides whether any given MS-formula holds for all the elements of G). Courcelle showed in [10] that the MS-theory of the class of partial k-trees is decidable. Seese <ref> [20] </ref> proved that if the MS-theory of a class of finite graphs M is decidable, then the graphs in M have uniformly bounded tree-width. Thus, tree-width "characterizes" classes of finite graphs having decidable MS-theories.
