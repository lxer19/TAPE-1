Abstract: We show that it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether the size of the accessible part of the power automaton of a nondeterministic semiautomaton exceeds a given bound. We also describe a class of simple transitive semiautomata that exhibit exponential blow-up during deterministic simulation.

Reference-contexts: We will refer to any deterministic transitive semiautomaton as a Fischer automaton. The minimal Fischer automaton is also minimal in the sense of homomor-phisms, and arises naturally in the study of the 0-minimal ideal in the syntactic semigroup of these languages, see <ref> [1] </ref>. There is yet another characterization of the minimal Fischer automaton: it is the subautomaton of the partial minimal DFA (the minimal DFA without the sink) determined by the unique strongly connected component that has outdegree 0, see [10]. Thus, for Fischer automata, the notions of minimality and reducedness coincide.

Reference-contexts: One might argue that minimal DFAs are not the best possible measure of complexity for a regular, factorial and transitive language, since there is another normal form for machines accepting languages of this type. This normal form was introduced in <ref> [3] </ref> by Fischer, who was concerned with ergodic properties of shift systems. Fischer shows that for every regular, factorial and transitive language there is a deterministic transitive semiautomaton. Moreover, the minimal such automaton is unique up to isomorphism. We will refer to any deterministic transitive semiautomaton as a Fischer automaton.

Reference-contexts: By the celebrated Immerman-Szelepsenyi theorem, the Weak Connected Component Size problem is in NLOG. The corresponding reachability problem, where we are given an additional target node t and we have to decide if t is reachable from s, is NLOG-complete, see <ref> [4] </ref>. In the succinct version of the problem, the graph in question has N = 2 n nodes and the 9 adjacencies between the nodes are not given by a standard data structure, such as adjacency lists, but by a boolean circuit A. <p> Proof. To establish PSPACE-hardness of the problem, we use Kozen's result that it is PSPACE-hard to determine whether a given collection of DFAs determines an empty intersection language, see [7] or <ref> [4] </ref>. The construction in the first reference produces machines with unique final states. So suppose we have a list M 1 ; : : : ; M r of DFAs over some alphabet . We assume that a; b; c are three new symbols not occurring in .

Reference-contexts: Weiss showed that every sofic system is the homomorphic image of a subshift of finite type. The homomorphisms in question are surjective maps h : X ! Y that are continuous and commute with the shift. By Hedlund's theorem, see <ref> [5] </ref>, these maps are precisely the global functions 1 associated with 1-dimensional cellular automata. The global maps have a finitary description in terms of a local map : w ! : 1 (X)(i) = (X (i) : : : X (i + w 1) for any configuration X. <p> The graphs in question here are binary de Bruijn graphs. This is somewhat surprising since the only de Bruijn automata that accept all strings are balanced: every word must have the same multiplicity with respect to the de Bruijn automaton, see <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Subshifts, Covers and Fischer Automata Nondeterministic finite state machines can be converted to equivalent deterministic machines using the standard power automaton construction, see <ref> [6] </ref>. The price one has to pay for determinism is a potentially exponential increase in the number of states.

Reference-contexts: Then A (x) has cardinality at most r 1 and we have K=B P mff ([r]) X ff (A (x))=ff ([r]) + 1=ff ([r]) X 2 m i + 2 m i 1: Thus, K &lt; B, and we are done. 2 It was pointed out by Ravikumar <ref> [8] </ref> that the uniqueness of the final states in the Kozen automata implies that the related State Reachability Problem for the power automaton of a nondeterministic machine is also PSPACE-complete.

Reference: [10] <author> K. Sutner. </author> <title> Linear cellular automata and Fischer automata. </title> <note> Submitted. </note>
Reference-contexts: The cover of the sofic system rg 1 is referred to as the the language of the cellular automaton , in symbols L (), and these languages are in addition transitive. There is a canonical semiautomaton B () based on a de Bruijn graph that accepts L (), see <ref> [10] </ref> for details. In fact, there is a whole sequences of languages associated with the cellular automaton, obtained by iterating the global map. Wolfram conjectured in [14] that the sizes of the corresponding minimal DFAs are in general non-decreasing. <p> There is yet another characterization of the minimal Fischer automaton: it is the subautomaton of the partial minimal DFA (the minimal DFA without the sink) determined by the unique strongly connected component that has outdegree 0, see <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus, for Fischer automata, the notions of minimality and reducedness coincide. There is no similar normal form for sofic systems. <p> In fact, circulants play no crucial role at all. Similar blow-up seems to occur in any type of transitive semiautomata based on a 1-permutation labeling in a (2; 2)-regular graph. For example, using a somewhat more complicated version of the shift/delete process it is shown in <ref> [10] </ref> that there is a large class of linear cellular automata whose associated Fischer automata exhibit full exponential blow-up. The graphs in question here are binary de Bruijn graphs.

Reference-contexts: For example, a subshift of finite type is 1 chararcterized by the fact that its cover is a finite complement language, that is, there is a finite set F of words over fl such that cov (X ) = fl fl F fl , see Weiss <ref> [11] </ref>. Likewise, a subshift X is a sofic system if cov (X ) is a regular language. The proper homomorphisms for subshifts are given by continuous maps that commute with the shift, that is, by cellular automata.
