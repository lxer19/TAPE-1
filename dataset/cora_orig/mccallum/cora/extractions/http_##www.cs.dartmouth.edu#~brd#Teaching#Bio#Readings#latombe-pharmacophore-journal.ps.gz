Abstract: This paper describes a randomized approach for finding invariants in a set of flexible and chemically distinct ligands (drug molecules) that underlies an integrated software system called RAPID currently under development. An invariant is a collection of features embedded in &lt; 3 which is present in one or more of the possible low-energy conformations of each ligand. Such invariants are called pharmacophores and contain the parts of the ligand that are primarily responsible for its binding with a receptor. The identification of pharmacophores is crucial in drug design since frequently the structure of targeted receptor is unknown but a number of molecules that interact with it have been discovered by experiments. In these cases the pharmacophore is used as a template for building more effective drugs. It is expected that our techniques and results will prove useful in other applications such as molecular database screening and comparative molecular field analysis.

Reference-contexts: Recent articles, which attempt to compare different methods, emphasize the superior quality of the results obtained with randomized techniques [11]. Invariant identification is related to the well-studied problem in geometric optimization of finding common point sets [1,17]. Determining the congruence of two point-sets in &lt; 3 is tractable <ref> [1] </ref> in the absence of complications such as noise. However, invariant identification is more closely related to the problem of identifying the largest common point set (LCP). <p> This problem has been studied extensively in the literature [20]. For general ff, the best known algorithms were obtained in <ref> [1] </ref>. These have a worst-case running time of O (n 4:6 ) for unknown ff, and O (n 2:6 =ff 2 ) (randomized) when ff is known for 3D. In 2D, the corresponding bounds obtained are O (n 3:2 ) and O (n 2:2 =ff).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Computational chemists working in the area of structure-based drug design consider both chemical and geometric properties of the interacting molecules when developing new pharmaceutical drugs <ref> [4] </ref>. The underlying assumption is that drug activity, or pharmacophoric activity, is obtained through the molecular recognition and binding of one molecule (ligand) to a pocket of another, usually larger, molecule (receptor). <p> This assumption is supported by experimental results showing molecules with geometric and chemical complementarity in their binding conformations [6]. When the three-dimensional structure of the receptor is known, docking methods <ref> [4] </ref> exploit both the geometric and the chemical information available. However, the geometric structures of relatively few molecules have been obtained via X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. <p> The features of the pharmacophore interact with features of the receptor, while the rest of the ligand acts as a scaffold. Once a pharmacophore has been isolated, it can be used to further improve the activity of a pharmaceutical drug <ref> [4] </ref>. We consider the following problem: Given a set of ligands that interact with the same receptor, find geometric invariants of these ligands, i.e., a set of features embedded in &lt; 3 that is present in one or more valid conformations of each of the ligands. <p> A valid conformation is a rigid spatial realization of the atoms of a molecule whose energy is below a predefined threshold [6]. Besides providing templates for drug design, geometric invariant identification is useful in formulating database queries for retrieving functionally equivalent, but structurally novel, molecules from molecular databases <ref> [4] </ref> and in suggesting alignments of molecules for input to CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) and other 3D QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) methods [5]. <p> This molecule is called 1TMN and it is an inhibitor of thermolysin. Figure 1 (a) shows the space filling model of 1TMN, by drawing a Van der Walls sphere <ref> [4] </ref> around each atom center. <p> These molecules fit into the same cavity of thermolysin and by their presence inhibit the activity associated with that cavity. This example was chosen because all the inhibitors have been crystallized with thermolysin and their active conformations are known and recorded in the PDB database <ref> [4] </ref>. Note that 1TLP has 69 atoms and 10 torsional degrees of freedom, 4TMN has 68 atoms and 15 degrees of freedom, 5TMN has 64 atoms and 13 degrees of freedom, and 6TMN has 63 atoms and 12 degrees of freedom.

In this paper we describe our efforts to prototype an integrated software system, called RAPID (RAndomized Pharmacophore Identification for Drug design) for addressing the pharmacophore identification problem. We present briefly the overall structure of RAPID and outline related work in Section 2. <p> Although maximum clique detection is NP-hard, the algorithm seems to work well in practice [19]. The approach can be generalized to n conformations by choosing a reference conformation and comparing it with the other n 1 conformations, but it can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the operations performed <ref> [5] </ref>. Other techniques for pharmacophore identification include expansion of small invariants, hashing techniques, and genetic algorithms (see [16] for a survey). 3 Conformational Search Our algorithm proceeds as follows. Initially a large number of conformations are generated at random.

Reference-contexts: This distribution is frequently the uniform distribution. However, if some a priori information is available about the preferred values of a particular degree of freedom, then the corresponding values are selected according to a distribution that reflects the a priori information (e.g., Gaussian). An efficient minimizer <ref> [7] </ref> is then used to obtain conformations at local energy minima. Minimization is the most time-consuming step, so we have carefully optimized this procedure. To obtain a representative set of conformations from our sample, we partition it into sets that reflect geometric similarity as captured by the distance measure DRMS.

Reference-contexts: As far as conformational search is concerned, both systematic and randomized techniques are being investigated [18].

Recent articles, which attempt to compare different methods, emphasize the superior quality of the results obtained with randomized techniques [11].

Reference-contexts: The noisy version of the problem was considered in [2] yielding an O (n 8 ) algorithm in 2D. (Refer to [14] for recent results in the noisy model.) We now describe two random-sampling schemes for solving LCP-ff on noisy data. Our analysis (presented in <ref> [10] </ref>) assumes that the data is exact. We use the notation g (n) = ~ O (f (n)), where f and g are functions, to indicate that g (n) = O (f (n) log n). <p> In addition to this, we may wish to find an invariant that does not exist in all the molecules, but in some fixed number of them. We use a marking scheme (described in <ref> [10] </ref>) to keep track of the number of times an invariant fails to match against a molecule, and reject those invariants which exceed the maximum allowed number of failures. 5 Experimental Results This section reports experimental results for the algorithms described above. <p> An experimental evaluation (shown in <ref> [10] </ref>), reveals a strong correlation between the running time of the algorithm and c , and a much weaker correlation between the running time and m . Our most intersting experiment is the plot of c against ff for the two algorithms in Figure 5. <p> The authors would like to thank Piotr Indyk and Dan Halperin for many helpful discussions.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the LCP problem turns out to exceedingly difficult; in fact, even for m collections of n points on the real line, the LCP cannot be approximated to within an n * factor unless P = N P , and only weak positive results are known <ref> [17] </ref>. In computational chemistry, the most popular algorithms for invariant identification are based on clique-detection. For instance, DISCO [19] initially considers a pair of conformations belonging to different molecules and constructs a graph whose cliques correspond to 3 candidate pharmacophores.
