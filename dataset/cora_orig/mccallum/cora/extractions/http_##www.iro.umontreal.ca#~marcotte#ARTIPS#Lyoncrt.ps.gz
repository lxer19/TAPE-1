Reference-contexts: The equivalent optimization program is then: min x2 multi f (x) = 0 Z 1 x (ff)=ff dffi: (11) In this case, Algorithm FW is precisely the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving an infinite dimensional problem, as described in Auslender and Brodeau <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The results are presented in Tables 5-9. Contrary to the standard Frank-Wolfe procedure, or even its generalization to infinite-dimensional space by Auslender and Brodeau <ref> [1] </ref>, our algorithm can address this particular case of an asymmetric variational inequality, under various stepsize rules.

Reference-contexts: If the number of classes is finite, the above framework involves as a particular case the general fixed demand, multimodal traffic assignment problem (see Dafermos <ref> [3] </ref>). In this paper, we restrict the model in two ways.

Reference-contexts: In the multiclass model considered in this paper, one substitutes for the vector (h (ff)) ff a continuous density function h () defined over the real half-line [0; 1) . The infinite dimensional formulation of this multiclass problem is still given by (5) (see Marcotte and Zhu <ref> [7] </ref>), where the parameter ff runs over the nonnegative axis and summations over the index ff are replaced by integrals. <p> Leurent proposed for its solution, in the case where arc cost functions are gradient mappings, i.e., there exists an optimization formulation of the variational inequality (5), a stochastic gradient method with sublinear rate of convergence. 2 A Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its imple mentation In <ref> [7] </ref>, a multiclass extension of the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm was introduced. In the view that the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, or variants thereof, is the only method able of properly exploiting the network structure of the traffic assignment problem, this choice seems natural.

Reference-contexts: is integrable, i.e., there exists f () such that r x f (x) = C (X) + G (X)=ff, then the solutions of the variational inequality (5) coincide with the points that satisfy the first-order necessary conditions for the mathematical program: min x2 multi f (x): (10) As shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, a necessary and sufficient condition for such a function f () to exist is that F () be a gradient mapping and that G () be constant. <p> As shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, a necessary and sufficient condition for monotonicity 4 is that C () be monotone and that G () be constant.

In this situation, four stepsize rules have been proposed and analyzed in [8]: a fixed stepsize, a stepsize minimizing (approximately) the gap function in the direction d i , a stepsize corresponding to the term of a divergent series, and the rule: t i+1 = t i (1=2)t 2 i . <p> Furthermore, unless the optimal face is reached finitely, the converge rate is sublinear. In infinite dimension, the situation is quite different. In <ref> [8] </ref> it is proved that, under suitable assumptions, the convergence of algorithm FW is geometric, without the iterates ever entering the optimal face, and this convergence rate can be achieved with the use of a constant stepsize.

Reference-contexts: The numerical tests have been performed on a small and on a medium-size network. The first network is inspired from the road network of the city of Sioux Falls, Iowa. (See <ref> [9] </ref> for a description of the network.) It comprises 24 nodes, 76 arcs, and its origin-destination matrix is full (552 entries). Two sets of cost data have been used: the first involves arc separable delay functions, while the second corresponds to asymmetric, two-way traffic interactions.

Reference-contexts: an algorithmic standpoint the multiclass model has a significant advantage over the classical model in that its convergence order is lin 2 In special cases, e.g. if the costs G a are binary (0 or 1) the parametric shortest paths can be computed in polynomial time, see Orlin and Tarjan <ref> [10] </ref>. 11 ear. In practice, this is counterbalanced by the fact that the convergence rate might be quite low, and can only be observed after an inordinate number of iterations.
