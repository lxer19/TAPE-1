Reference-contexts: The main difference between this and the v-fold method is that each data point may be used as a test point more than once. Smyth (1996) compares the performance of a variety of model selection methods, including MCCV, 10-fold cross-validation, BIC, and the Autoclass algorithm <ref> (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1996) </ref> which is an analytic approximation to the full Bayesian solution. <p> This indicates that as the dimensionality of the E0F space grows beyond d = 2, the clusters in any of these dimensional spaces are essentially the same as for the the two-dimensional sub-space. 11 4.4 Comparisons with Bayesian and Penalized Likelihood Techniques Autoclass 2.0 <ref> (Cheeseman and Stutz, 1996) </ref> was applied to the same data as described above. The default version of Autoclass (full covariance matrices) returned k = 3 as by far the most likely choice for the number of clusters, i.e., no other k values had any significant posterior probability.

Reference-contexts: This has motivated the use of a variety of cluster analysis algorithms to objectively classify observed geophysical fields into a small set of preferred regimes or categories, e.g., fuzzy clustering (Mo and Ghil, 1988), kernel density estimation and "bump hunting" (Kimoto and Ghil, 1993), hierarchical clustering <ref> (Cheng and Wallace, 1993) </ref>, and least-squares (or k-means) clustering (Michelangeli, Vautard, and Legras (1995)). While these approaches have produced useful and repeatable results (in terms of significant cluster patterns), there is nonetheless a degree of subjectivity in the application of these clustering techniques which is undesirable. <p> Cheng and Wallace's methodology for arriving at three clusters was based on a combination of ad hoc resampling techniques and subjective judgement of the hierarchical clustering results. In their own words, "the more reproducible clusters are strung out along three well-defined branches of the family tree" <ref> (Cheng and Wallace, 1993) </ref>. It is interesting to note that the cross-validation results described in this paper were obtained completely independently, i.e., the cross-validation data analysis was carried out without knowledge at that time of the Cheng and Wallace result.

Reference-contexts: Of course, as mentioned earlier, implementing the Bayesian approach in practice involves approximation of one form or another and, indeed, cross-validation itself can be viewed as a different type of approximation in the Bayesian context <ref> (Dawid, 1984) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is also well known that standard hypothesis testing methods (such as testing the hypothesis k = 2 against k = 1) fail in this context due to the breakdown of the standard assumptions on the asymptotic properties of the estimators <ref> (Feng and McCulloch, 1996) </ref>. Alternatives, such as the bootstrap likelihood ratio (Aitkin et al., 1981; McLachlan, 1987) have been proposed, but not extensively investigated. Bayesian and penalized likelihood methods provide more general approaches for "honest" estimates of the number of components.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, this test likelihood l test k should be a more useful estimator (than the training data likelihood l train k ) for comparing mixture models with different numbers of components. (This test log-likelihood is also known as the log predictive score in the Bayesian model selection literature <ref> (e.g., see Good, 1952) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Thus, in practice, the search for parameters is usually constrained to interior regions of parameter space which do not contain such spurious solutions <ref> (Hathaway, 1985) </ref>. The application of parameter estimation techniques (such as EM) assume that k (the number of components) is fixed. In practice, it is frequently the case that k is unknown, and, thus, one would like to also be able to infer some information about k from the data.

Reference-contexts: Direct identification of these regimes in observed flow fields is difficult. This has motivated the use of a variety of cluster analysis algorithms to objectively classify observed geophysical fields into a small set of preferred regimes or categories, e.g., fuzzy clustering <ref> (Mo and Ghil, 1988) </ref>, kernel density estimation and "bump hunting" (Kimoto and Ghil, 1993), hierarchical clustering (Cheng and Wallace, 1993), and least-squares (or k-means) clustering (Michelangeli, Vautard, and Legras (1995)).

Reference-contexts: Examples include selecting the best classification tree using cross-validated classification error (Breiman et al., 1984) and variable selection in linear regression using cross-validated predictive squared error (Hjort, 1995). Cross-validation has also been used in unsupervised learning in the context of kernel density estimation for automatically choosing smoothing parameters <ref> (e.g., Silverman, 1986) </ref>. However, it has not been applied to the problem of determining cluster structure in clustering problems, i.e., solving the problem of how many clusters to fit to a given data set.

Reference-contexts: In general, there appears to be no obvious systematic method to automatically determine the best fi to use for a particular problem when the true structure is unknown, although the choice of fi = 0:5 appears to be reasonably robust across a variety of problems <ref> (Smyth, 1996) </ref>. In terms of choosing the number of different partitions M , the larger the value the less the variability in the log-likelihood estimates. In practice, values of M between 20 and 50 appear adequate for most applications.
