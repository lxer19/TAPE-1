Reference-contexts: More modern schemes modify the virtual channel idea to allow adaptive routing, as in Linder and Harden's scheme [7] that builds an acyclic virtual network out of virtual channels, Chien and Kim's planar routing scheme <ref> [1] </ref> that restricts adaptivity to bound queue requirements, and Su and Shin's 3P scheme [8] that is fully adaptive and uses small queues. All of these schemes, however, assume that destination processors are infinite sinks, i.e. each processor has an effectively infinite queue. <p> We start by showing that the congestion is reduced by (log N ) on every round of the routing. Let the keys for the packets be chosen randomly from the interval <ref> [1; K] </ref>, where 1 is high priority and K is low priority. Define a small packet as one whose key is smaller than (aK log N )=C, where a is a constant to be determined.

Reference-contexts: Some schemes use simple rules to constrain routing choices so that the routing is deadlock-free, for example dimension order packet routing on meshes. Modifications for wormhole routing have been suggested by Dally and Seitz using virtual channels <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The extra unreserved queue entries can be used by any virtual network and are useful for maintaining full utilization of the wires when only a few virtual networks are active. 15 This algorithm is called the virtual channel algorithm because it resembles Dally and Seitz's virtual channel router in <ref> [2] </ref>. The only limitation of this algorithm is that the number of virtual networks is limited by the queue space at a switch. In order to support V virtual networks each switch must have a (V ) size queue.

Reference-contexts: The problem in WANs is that the network wants to give a fair amount of bandwidth to each conversation passing over a link. Many algorithms for routing traffic fairly have been proposed for use in these wide area networks <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. These algorithms are able to support an arbitrary number of virtual networks (called conversations), but they require queues at each switch whose size is linear in the number of virtual networks.

Reference-contexts: In order to separate the issues of deadlock within the network and deadlock between the network and the processors, we will choose a deadlock-free network. In particular, we will use a network called the butterfly <ref> [5] </ref> (see figure 1-2). The butterfly network is popular because it has a large bandwidth (N packets per step) and low latency (log N steps). The results obtained in this paper 11 naturally generalize to any levelled network of depth d. <p> Therefore, we must drop one of the packets currently queued at the node. Second, we must use a Randade-like routing scheme <ref> [5] </ref>. Ranade's algorithm allows us to get good bounds on the routing time when constant-sized queues are used. This property will allow us to prove some statements about both the performance of individual virtual networks and the performance of the system as a whole. <p> Using a delay sequence argument, we can prove that a congestion O (log N ) route can be finished in O (log N ) time with high probability using Ranade's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. Therefore, if we choose the length of the round to be fi (log N ), the small packet routing completes by the end of the round, with high probability.

Reference-contexts: Although these algorithms are very good for preventing deadlock within the routing network, they do not address the problem of deadlock between the routing network and the processors. Thinking Machine's CM5 <ref> [6] </ref> has solved the deadlock problem for a limited case. In this machine there are two networks. One is called the request network and one is called the reply network. Request packets are sent on the request network and reply packets are sent on the reply network.
