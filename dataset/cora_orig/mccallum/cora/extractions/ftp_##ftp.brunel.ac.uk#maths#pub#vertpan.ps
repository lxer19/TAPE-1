Abstract: A digraph obtained by replacing each edge of a complete mul-tipartite graph by an arc or a pair of mutually opposite arcs with the same end vertices is called a complete multipartite digraph. Such a digraph D is called ordinary if for any pair X; Y of its partite sets the set of arcs with end vertices in X [ Y coincides with X fi Y = fx; y) : x 2 X; y 2 Y g or Y fi X or X fi Y [ Y fi X. We characterize all the pancyclic and vertex pancyclic ordinary complete multipartite digraphs. Our characterizations admit polynomial time algorithms. This paper forms part of a Ph.D. thesis written by the author under the supervision of Professor N. Alon at Tel Aviv University. fl

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3. If H is a prehamiltonian cycle of a strongly connected digraph G and the vertex of G, which is not in H, is adjacent with all vertices of H, then G is hamiltonian. The trivial proof is omitted. The following lemma was proved in <ref> [3] </ref>. Lemma 4.

Reference-contexts: Combining these results with the known necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a hamiltonian cycle in a complete bipartite digraph [3,5,7] we obtain a polynomial characterization for the above properties. A characterization of pancyclic (and vertex pancyclic) ordinary m-partite (m 3) tournaments was established in <ref> [4] </ref>. As opposed to the characterization of even pancyclic bipartite graphs the last one cannot imply immediately a characterization of pancyclic (or vertex pancyclic) ordinary complete m-partite digraphs. Indeed, there exist vertex pancyclic ordinary CMD's which contain no hamiltonian ordinary multipartite tournaments as spanning subgraphs.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that HhZ 1 [ Z 2 i is hamiltonian. This fact and Lemma 2 imply the following result which was also proved in <ref> [5] </ref> using a different approach. Lemma 7. D is hamiltonian if and only if it is strongly connected and has a 1-difactor. Lemma 8. Let jS (D)j 4, and jV (D)j 5.

Reference-contexts: In this work we derive characterizations of pancyclic and vertex pancyclic ordinary CMD's. These results differ from the corresponding ones for ordinary multipartite tournaments. A complete m-partite digraphs is called a complete digraph if its order is m. Moon <ref> [9] </ref> derived the following characterization of vertex pancyclic complete digraphs which we shall apply extensively in this paper: every strongly-connected complete digraph is vertex pancyclic. Some generalizations of Moon's Theorem were recently obtained in [2,6]. 2. Notation and Terminology Let D be an ordinary CMD.
