Reference-contexts: If an er ror is made in predicting this, the results are similar to those shown in table 2. Intruders from a relevant accident. In order to demonstrate the need for dividers, we calculate the casualty rates due to relevant accidents <ref> (Anwar & Jovanis, 1993) </ref> on that 12-mile section of the Santa Monica freeway which was studied by those authors. The model used to calculate the effects was basically the same as that discussed above for longitudinal control failures.

Reference-contexts: We have alr eady pointed out tha t proper design of degraded modes can ensur e that such violent events as collision of tw o platoons can be discounted <ref> (Hitchcock 1992) </ref>. If then, a vehicle accelerates without warning, it may collide with the vehicle immediately ahead. If it is in a pla toon, this is not ser ious, since the r elative speed is small.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION In some earlier papers <ref> (Hitchcock 1993a, b, 1994) </ref> a model has been described which makes quantitative estimates of the casualty rates in particular kinds of accidents on an automated highway system (AHS). The casualty rates depend on the way motion is organized within the AHS.
