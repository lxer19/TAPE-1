Abstract: In this paper, M/G/C/C state dependent queueing models are proposed for modeling and analyzing vehicular traffic flows. Congestion aspects of traffic flow are represented by introducing state dependent service rates as a function of number of vehicles on each road link. Analytical models for unidirectional and multi-source flows are presented. Finally, queueing models to analytically determine the optimal capacity and performance measures of the road links are incorporated into a series of software programs available from the authors.

However, we feel that the purpose of this example is to show the usage of our analytical models as a fundamentally new approximation tool for studying vehicular traffic flows.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of M/G/C/C state dependent queueing models makes it impossible to use direct analytical methods. The approximation approach undertaken in our research, for the purposes of analyzing more than one road segment (queueing node), is called the Generalized Expansion Method, which was first developed by Kerbache and Smith <ref> (Kerbache and Smith, 1987) </ref>. The generalized expansion method is a robust and effective approximation approach which is characterized to be a combination of Repeated Trials and Node-by-Node decomposition solution procedures. This method "expands" the original queueing network by introducing an artificial holding node preceding each blocking node. <p> This method "expands" the original queueing network by introducing an artificial holding node preceding each blocking node. A detailed discussion on the intricacies of generalized expansion method can be found in <ref> (Kerbache and Smith, 1987) </ref>. The current work uses a set of simultaneous non-linear equations generated by the generalized expansion method to capture the effect of blocking and to obtain the performance measures of all the road segments for the vehicular traffic flow problem.
