Title: Structured Video and the Construction of Space  
Author: Judith S. Donath 
Date: June 3, 1994  
Abstract: Image sequences can now be synthesized by compositing elements - objects, backgrounds, people from pre-existing source images. What are the rules that govern the placement of these elements in their new frames? If geometric projection is assumed to govern the composition, there is some freedom to move the elements about, but the range of placements is quite limited. Furthermore, projective geometry is not perceptually ideal think of the distortions seen at the edges of wide angle photographs. These distortions are not found in perspective paintings: painters modify the portrayal of certain objects to make them perceptually correct. This paper first reviews projective geometry in the context of image compositing and then introduces perceptually based composition. Its basis in human vision is analyzed and its application to image compositing discussed.

Reference-contexts: Finally, any lingering sense that an image appears realistic because it affects the eye in much the same way as the original scene is dispelled upon looking at it from different positions. Movement parallax, as Hochberg points out <ref> (Hochberg 78) </ref>, is one of the strongest depth cues: and it entirely absent from a 2D images. Our perception of realism in pictures and films occurs in the context of a number of cues telling the perceptual system how different are the image and the real thing.

Reference-contexts: Distinguishing between viewer- and object-based representations is quite useful in the context of structured video. The structuring data may be object-based, such as a 3D model <ref> (Holtzman 91) </ref> The information encoded in this model is a description of the object itself. It does not include a particular viewpoint that information is indeterminate until the object is rendered. Or the structuring data may be view-based, such as the 2D pictures of objects we have been discussing.

Reference-contexts: The ambiguity remains if the view plane moved: such changes do not alter the image content. Thus, the substitutions (of a large object for a small one, etc.) can be made into scenes of varying magnification and VPN angle. <ref> (See McLean 91 for a discussion of the reprojection process) </ref>. 4. Real images have edges. The real image plane is a clipped window onto the infinite view plane.
