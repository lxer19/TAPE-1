ABSTRACT 1 According to the thesis "computability = deducibility" <ref> [4] </ref> here are investigated intensional aspects of domain theory as mathematical theory of computability (cf. e.g. [1-4]). A logistic system is any pair of sets A = hA; Ri, where R Conf (A) * ) P (A)fi (A [f]g), ] =2 A. <p> notion suitable finitarity conditions (and others) it is possible to characterize rather naturally, from the point of view of the above mentioned thesis, various classes of domains, e.g. classes of all complete lattices with a base, conditionally complete partially ordered sets with a base, complete f 0 -spaces (cf. also <ref> [4] </ref> where only finitary reflexive deducibility is considered), complete A 0 -spaces, and continuous lattices. For example, Th (hA; `i) is an (arbitrary) complete A 0 -space under if for some R Conf (A) the following three conditions hold: (1) =' 2 R ) is finite, (i.e.
