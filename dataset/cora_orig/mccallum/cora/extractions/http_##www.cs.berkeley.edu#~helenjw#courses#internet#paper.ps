Title: PIN: Positional INformation Based Internet Services  
Author: Carleton Miyamoto and Helen J. Wang 
Affiliation: University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Division  
Abstract: We developed two PIN services. One is the "Service Center for Drivers", which provides drivers with Internet access in their car to services like "What are the closest gas stations?", and "how can I get there?". The other service is Traveling Weather, which provides users with appropriate weather forecasts of where they will be based on their calendar information. A novel approach taken by PIN services is that proxy is used as a service provider. It gathers pieces of information from various information sources on the web, then synthesizes them to provide better and more effective services. We used the TACC model [2], developed by the GloMop group of U. C. Berkeley, to build our services. It guarantees scalability, availability, and fault tolerance, so that Internet service developers can focus solely on their service features. We also implemented a utility library for all location based services, which also serves as an extension to TACC.

Reference-contexts: The following two sections give a more detailed description of this service. 2.1.1 The Architecture and Implementation for Drivers. It illustrates the data flow when a user makes service request. There are three basic entities: local proxy, proxy server, and information sources. The HTTP protocol <ref> [1] </ref> is used for the communication between these entities. To relieve users from the burden of entering their current location each time a request is made, the local proxy is used to intercept the service request.
