Abstract: We propose several heuristic approaches to the development of pricing algorithms for software agents that incorporate foresight, i.e., an ability to model and predict responses by competitors. In the absence of foresight, prior work has shown that, in an economy of myopic software agents, undesirable system behaviors such as endless price wars can frequently occur (Kephart et al., 1998). We show how the introduction of even the smallest amount of lookahead in
