Abstract: An object-dependent post-beamforming processing (PBP) technique is presented for improving conventional ultrasound imaging contrast resolution (CR). The technique is derived from the conventional delay-and-sum beamforming (DSB) algorithm and contains two major procedures. First, it utilizes the DSB results as an estimate of the actual image. Second, each estimated image pixel is processed by an object-dependent weighting factor for further suppressing sidelobe energy. Experimental results based on phantom data show that, with this technique, the sidelobe energy resulting from DSB can be significantly reduced. The system CR is thus improved. This CR improvement has also been quantitatively verified by image contrast to noise ratio (CNR) measurements. The algorithm can be implemented in real-time by adding a processing unit to the current conventional imaging system.

Reference-contexts: Typically, the granular structure of speckle masks the object details and thus limits the contrast detectability of the system [5, 7]. This detectability, however, can be enhanced by improving system CR which is typically determined by the number of independent speckles and the sidelobe energy <ref> [1, 3, 6] </ref>. Improvement in system CR can be achieved by reducing speckle variance via either spatial or frequency compounding [4, 8], However, studies have shown that, with these conventional methods, the gain in CR is achieved at the cost of reducing the spatial resolution of the system [4]. <p> In addition, if the array aperture size remains unchanged, the number of independent speckles is also unchanged. The sidelobe energy resulting from delay-and-sum beamforming (DSB) becomes a significant factor in determining the low contrast detectabilty of the system <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. In this situation, the improvement of CR gained by using compounding techniques is actually quite limited since sidelobe energy typically cannot be reduced via compounding [3]. In this paper, an object-dependent post-beamforming processing (PBP) technique is presented for improving system CR through sidelobe energy reduction.

Reference-contexts: The contrast of the cyst region is also improved. To quantify the above CR improvement, an average CN R for the cyst regions shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b are computed.
