Abstract: We approach the problem of congestion control in computer networks from the perspective of mechanism design. The network is modeled as an economy and some simplifying assumptions are made to derive a congestion control scheme. Subsequently, some of the assumptions are relaxed and the solution is generalized.

Reference-contexts: For example, the type could be the increase in throughput that would exactly offset a unit increase in delay. 5. 6. These two types of contracts have also been proposed for the Asynchronous Transfer Mode protocols of future Broadband ISDN networks, and for the DASH communications architecture <ref> [1] </ref>. - 4 - 3. Mathematical Modeling In this section we present a mathematical model of the network. We present precise definitions of terms that have been loosely described in the previous sections. 3.1. Notation There is one principal and I agents, indexed by i.

Reference-contexts: This is done by negotiating a contract between each agent and the principal during conversation set up. We model two forms of contracts: guaranteed performance contracts and best effort contracts 5.. 2.2.1. Guaranteed performance contracts In virtual circuit networks, such as those assumed by the design of DASH <ref> [2] </ref>, where guarantees of performance are offered, a contract promises a given level of performance (utility level) for a price. The agent states the throughput and delay it desires, and the principal states the price for the data transfer.

Most important, in the PLP problem, demand is for quantity alone, whereas we need to account for a demand for quantity (throughput) as well as quality (delay). 7.

Reference-contexts: At this point, packets are buffered, leading to delays. The additional delay can cause sources to retransmit, increasing the load on the bottleneck. This feedback leads to a rapidly deteriorating situation where retransmissions dominate the traffic, and effective throughput rapidly diminishes <ref> [11, 21] </ref>. Further, if there is gateway to gateway flow control, new packets may not be allowed to enter the gateway and so packets might be delayed at a preceding gateway as well. This can lead to deadlock where all traffic comes to a standstill [26].

Reference-contexts: This can lead to deadlock where all traffic comes to a standstill [26]. Existing congestion control schemes treat congestion as an isolated problem and propose ad hoc solutions that are not entirely satisfactory <ref> [12] </ref>. We approach the problem from a different perspective: a gateway is thought of as a principal that allocates throughput and delay to the conversations that pass through it. If this allocation is within the capacity constraint of the gateway, congestion cannot occur.

Reference-contexts: The perceived failure of these efforts, as well as a rapid growth in the scale and geographical extent of computer networks has sparked renewed interest in congestion control (for a detailed survey, see <ref> [13] </ref>). By definition, congestion occurs when an increase in the offered load results in a decrease in the effective throughput of the network [15]. The basic cause is that the short term packet arrival rate at some gateway exceeds its service rate 2. [17].

Reference-contexts: The key to network efficiency lies in selecting an appropriate allocation of gateway resources. Since this allocation will, in general, depend on the preferences of the sources, this is naturally modeled as a mechanism design problem. Designing a congestion control scheme using the techniques of mechanism design <ref> [14] </ref> assures us that the scheme is efficient and not subject to manipulation by ill-behaved sources. Thus, we believe that this is an appropriate theoretical basis for designing congestion control mechanisms. In this paper, we present an economic model of a computer network. <p> Thus, this constraint should be trivially satisfied. 10. This is only one of a number of alternate definitions of fairness. See [18, 27] for some other definitions. - 5 - Incentive compatible to reveal type (ICT) We assume the revelation principle <ref> [14] </ref> and hence propose a direct mechanism in which agents report their type, q i . Incentive compatibility implies that reporting q i is better than reporting any other value (to be precise, in dominant strategy equilibrium an agent will report its type as q i ).

Sanders has discussed optimal flow control schemes using incentive compatibility to determine the marginals of utility functions of the agents [22, 23]. However, her work is limited to the case of a first-come-first-served service discipline where delay and bandwidth cannot be independently allocated.

Reference-contexts: The principal could ask each agent for its type, but an agent could lie. Thus, it is necessary to design an incentive compatible mechanism that will elicit the correct type from the agent <ref> [23] </ref>. The principal also needs to know how much an agent is willing to pay. This is done by negotiating a contract between each agent and the principal during conversation set up. We model two forms of contracts: guaranteed performance contracts and best effort contracts 5.. 2.2.1. <p> The difficulty lies in the assumption that the principal is aware of the form of the V i s. This is a strong assumption to make and may not be true in all cases. In the mechanism proposed by Sanders <ref> [23] </ref>, the agent communicates its marginal utility from delay and throughput to the principal, who does not need to know the form of V. It may be possible to use a variant of this approach in our problem. 6. <p> Sanders has discussed optimal flow control schemes using incentive compatibility to determine the marginals of utility functions of the agents <ref> [22, 23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The principal may desire to give an incentive to GS agents to use the network at off peak times. Borrowing from work in classical peak load pricing <ref> [25] </ref>, this can be achieved by charging peak time GS agents for capacity and marginal costs, and off-peak time GS agents for marginal costs alone. The question of how much rent should be paid to BE agents is an interesting open - 8 - problem. 5.4. <p> Economic models of computer systems have been investigated by Yemini [9] and Miller [16].
