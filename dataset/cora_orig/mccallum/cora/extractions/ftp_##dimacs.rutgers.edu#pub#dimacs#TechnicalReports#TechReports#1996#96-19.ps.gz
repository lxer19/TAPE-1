Reference-contexts: For q = fa; b; c; dg we say that t q = abjcd is a valid quartet split of T , if abjcd is a split of T fl jq . As in Bandelt and 7 Dress <ref> [2] </ref>, it is easy to see that if abjcd is a valid quartet split of T , then so are bajcd and cdjab; (5) and we identify these three splits. <p> It is a classical result that Q (T ) determines T (Colonius and Schulze [10], Bandelt and Dress <ref> [2] </ref>); indeed for each i 2 [n]; ft q : i 2 qg determines T , and T can be computed in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Setting a complete list of inference rules seems hopeless (Bryant and Steel <ref> [3] </ref>). Instead, Dekker [11] introduced a restricted concept, dyadic and higher order inference. He says that a set of quartet splits A dyadically infers a quartet split t, if t can be derived from A by repeated applications of rules (5), (6) and (7).

Reference-contexts: If this bipartition is a non-trivial split of T , the site is said to support T , and in this case we also call the site non-trivial. The maximum compatibility method selects a tree that maximizes the number of supporting sites. Buneman <ref> [4] </ref> showed that each bph tree T is uniquely defined by its non-trivial splits. This fact justifies the use of the maximum compatibility method. Of fundamental interest in phylogenetic analysis is the probability of recovering the correct tree, that is P [(x [S]) = T M ]. <p> Let (T ) denote the set of non-trivial splits of T = T M . We have j (T )j = n 3 <ref> [4] </ref>. For 2 (T ), let the random variable X be the number of non-trivial sites which induce split . Let X := P X .

Reference-contexts: There is a simple information theoretic lower bound for N , if tree reconstruction is possible. The number of bph trees with n labelled leaves is jB (n)j = (2n 5)!! <ref> [5] </ref>. If all bph trees are encoded with N sites, each site has 2 n character states, and all trees can be reconstructed (for sure, or for almost sure), then we must have (2n 5)!! 2 nN , i.e. c log n &lt; N .

Reference-contexts: Many models have been proposed to describe, stochastically, the evolution of sites. The simplest model, for two-state sites, is the symmetric model, due to Cavender <ref> [6] </ref> and Farris [13], which we have elsewhere called the CF (=Cavender-Farris) model. Let f0; 1g denote the two states. Although the CF model is usually described, for biological reasons, on a rooted bph tree, we can, 3 without loss of generality, disregard this feature of the model.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Cavender-Farris model possesses two quadratic polynomial invariants for each binary tree on four leaves, first discovered by Cavender and Felsenstein <ref> [7] </ref>. Phylogenetic invariants are potentially useful in reconstructing T M from x [S].

Reference-contexts: However, provided the sites evolve i.i.d. under a suitable Markov-style assumption condition, (2) holds (Steel [23], Chang <ref> [8] </ref>). Now we discuss a specific, popular tree reconstruction method. (VI) Maximum compatibility. Given a bph tree T with leaf set [n], deleting an edge e of T disconnects T into two components, and thereby induces a bipartition of 4 [n] consisting of the leaves of the two components.

Reference-contexts: Equation (3) now follows from a famous result concerning the asymptotics of this problem (Erd-os and Renyi <ref> [12] </ref>): for x 2 R, N fl balls (N fl as defined above), and (n 3) boxes, the limit of probability of filling each boxes is e e x . &gt;From compactness arguments, there exists a probability distribution maximizing (4).

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Simple models of nucleotide substitution are often used to analyse or justify methods for reconstructing evolutionary trees from aligned DNA sequences. One of the earliest, and still most striking examples of this approach, due to Felsenstein <ref> [14] </ref>, reveals that two popular methods|maximum parsimony and maximum compatibility|can be seriously misled when the underlying mutation model has its parameters lying in a particular region (subsequently nicknamed "Felsenstein zone").

Reference-contexts: It is important to stress that we are not advocating the use of the method we describe. For a small n it may well require a sequence length N larger than other more conventional statistical techniques, such as maximum likelihood (Felsenstein <ref> [15] </ref>, Goldman [16], Saitou [21]). Furthermore the bounds we give for our method are also, almost certainly, not the best possible.

Reference-contexts: This result, and other more recent embellishments (see Hendy <ref> [17] </ref>, Zharkikh and Li [28], Takezaki and Nei [26], Steel et al. [24]) concern statistical consistency, and as such are asymptotic results| that is they are concerned with outcomes as the sequence length (i.e. the number of sites) tends to infinity.

Reference-contexts: This is related to, but different from, the question considered by Lecointre et al. <ref> [18] </ref>. In that paper the authors consider the length of sequences required in order for the reconstructed tree to be supported by high bootstrap proportions.

Reference-contexts: extension is that an unknown bph tree T with n leaves can be constructed by asking at most O (n log n) queries of the form: "what is t q ?" for a choice of q that depends on the answers to the queries so far asked (Pearl and Tarsi <ref> [19] </ref>, Warnow [27]). It would be useful to tell from a set of quartet splits if they are valid quartet splits of any bph tree. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-complete (Steel [22]).

Evol., </journal> <volume> 2(2), </volume> <month> 133-152 </month> <year> (1994). </year>
Reference-contexts: Exactly how large this "reasonable" number must be, will surely depend also on the number of sequences (see Philippe and Douzery <ref> [20] </ref>), n. More precisely, consider the question of how many sites N must be generated independently and identically, according to a substitution model M in order to reconstruct the underlying binary tree on n species with pre-specified probability 1 * by a particular method . <p> are placed on the parameters associated with edges of the tree then the sequence length might need to be astronomically large, even for four sequences, since the "edge length" of the internal edge (s) of the tree can be made arbitrarily short (as was pointed out by Philippe and Douzery <ref> [20] </ref>). A similar problem arises for four sequences when one or more of the four non-internal edges is "long"|that is, when site saturation has occurred on the line of descent represented by the edge (s).

Reference-contexts: An extension of this result is that for any T 2 B (n) a carefully chosen subset of Q (T ) of cardinality n 3 determines T (Steel <ref> [22] </ref>). <p> It would be useful to tell from a set of quartet splits if they are valid quartet splits of any bph tree. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-complete (Steel <ref> [22] </ref>).
