Abstract: Although AI planning techniques can potentially be useful in several manufacturing domains, this potential remains largely unrealized. In order to adapt AI planning techniques to manufacturing, it is important to develop more realistic and robust ways to address issues important to manufacturing engineers. Furthermore, by investigating such issues, AI researchers may be able to discover principles that are relevant for AI planning in general. As an example, in this paper we describe the techniques for manufacturing-operation planning used in IMACS (Interactive Manufactura-bility Analysis and Critiquing System), and compare and contrast them with the techniques used in classical AI planning systems. We describe how one of IMACS's planning techniques may be useful for AI planning in general|and as an example, we describe how it helps to explain a puzzling complexity result in AI planning.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction AI planning techniques can potentially be useful in several manufacturing domains. However, with the exception of manufacturing scheduling, previous applications of AI planning technology to manufacturing (cf. <ref> [ Famili et al., 1992 ] </ref> ) generally have had little impact on manufacturing practices [ Ham and Lu, 1988; Nevins and Whitney, 1989; Shah et al., 1994 ] . One reason for this difficulty appears to be the different world views of AI planning researchers and manufacturing planning researchers.

Reference-contexts: Of these, we define a primary feature to be a feature that contains as much of the stock as possible without intersecting with the part, and as little space as possible outside the stock. Figure 5 shows examples of primary and non-primary features; for a detailed definition see <ref> [ S. Gupta and Nau, 1995 ] </ref> . As described in [ S. <p> Typical approaches for computer-aided tolerance charting are computation-ally very intensive, and only consider limited types of tolerances [ Ji, 1993; Mittal et al., 1990 ] . Thus, IMACS simply evaluates the manufacturability aspects of a wide variety of tolerances without getting into optimization aspects, as described in <ref> [ S. Gupta and Nau, 1995 ] </ref> . As an example, the operation plan shown in Figure 8 satisfies the tolerances shown in Figure 3, and thus is an acceptable way to make P 0 from S 0 .

Reference-contexts: To select cutting parameters such as those shown in Figure 8 (c), IMACS uses the recommendations of the Machinability Data Center's handbook <ref> [ Machinability Data Center, 1980 ] </ref> . The maximum recommended cutting parameters are used, rather than attempting to select optimal cutting parameters; thus IMACS's estimates involve considerable approximation.
