Abstract: The automated construction of integrated terrain skins directly from cartographic source data is a significant component toward the concept of rapid construction of synthetic environments. While fully automated terrain database generation has not yet been realized, some significant steps have been demonstrated. During early 1996, a 40km fi 40km integrated terrain skin of Camp Pendleton was generated to support and visualize SAF exercises. The Camp Pendleton exercise database was constructed using a variety of automated, semi-automated, and manual methods. Terrain was modeled with an integrated Triangular Irregular Network (iTIN) that included bathymetry as well as terrain elevation data from six sources. Built-up areas and areas of high fidelity interest were accommodated as relaxed polygon budget constraints for the iTIN. Certain ground based features were integrated into the exercise terrain skin. They included drivable roads, simple bridges, lakes and rivers, underwater breaklines, an ocean surface, and detailed cliff structure along the Pacific coast. In this paper we will discuss the process by which the terrain skin for the Camp Pendleton exercise database was developed, the level of automation achieved in this project, problems encountered during the course of construction, and the degree to which standard mapping products could be directly utilized.

Reference-contexts: Since the database was of a location in the U.S., we had both DMA <ref> [4] </ref> and USGS data available. This included Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) Level I, USGS 30m DEMs, and USGS Digital Line Graphs (DLG). In addition to the usual sources, a Tactical Terrain Data (TTD) prototype was available for the area.
