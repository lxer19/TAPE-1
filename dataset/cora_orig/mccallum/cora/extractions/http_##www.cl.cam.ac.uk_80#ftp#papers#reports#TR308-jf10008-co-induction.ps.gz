Title: A Case Study of Co-induction in Isabelle HOL

Abstract: The consistency of the dynamic and static semantics for a small functional programming language was informally proved by R.Milner and M.Tofte. The notions of co-inductive definitions and the associated principle of co-induction played a pivotal role in the proof. With emphasis on co-induction, the work presented here deals with the formalisation of this result in the higher-order logic of the generic theorem prover Isabelle.
