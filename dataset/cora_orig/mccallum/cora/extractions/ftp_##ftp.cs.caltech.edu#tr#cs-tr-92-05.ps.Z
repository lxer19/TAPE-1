Reference-contexts: The first section derives summation formulae used in subsequent calculations. A recursive technique for calculating a family of formulae is derived, and it is used to deduce the needed equations. A Mathe-matica <ref> [5] </ref> package that can be used to compute any formula in the family is also derived. The second section develops a recursive technique for computing the distance distribution of any mesh. <p> The technique will be adapted for use with Mathematica <ref> [5] </ref>. The required Mathematica input will be listed, and a table of sample results will be given. The Mathematica package will use a refinement of our sum nota tion.
