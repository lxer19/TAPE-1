Reference-contexts: the support of multiple media, while the telephony application emphasizes sophisticated call control. [Adding multiple media to the telephony client doesn't seem to increase its signaling complexity any.] fl MCI has contributed to the support of this work. 1 1.1 Terminology This specification uses the same words as RFC 1123 <ref> [1] </ref> to define the significance of each particular requirement. These are: MUST: This word or the adjective 'required' means that the item is an absolute requirement of the specifi cation.

Reference-contexts: features is said to be 'unconditionally compliant'; one that satisfies all of the 'must' requirements but not all of the 'should' requirements for its features is said to be 'conditionally compliant'. 2 Basic Requirements 2.1 SIP Protocol Support Clients and server MUST implement SIP as described in Internet draft draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-05.txt <ref> [2] </ref> and call control services as described in draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-cc-00.txt [3]. A technical report [4] provides additional motivation and descriptions of more advanced services. Nothing in this requirements document should contradict the specification, but this document describes SIP servers and user agents focused on implementation, not protocol elements. <p> If all is not present, the server SHOULD either proxy or redirect the call, depending on the configuration (Section 5), with redirection being the default action. Proxying is described in the chapter Behavior of SIP Servers in the SIP specification <ref> [2] </ref>. For redirection, the server returns a list of Location headers to the caller. 2. Map the name in Request-URI to a local user id as described in (Section 4.2). 3.

Reference-contexts: A technical report <ref> [4] </ref> provides additional motivation and descriptions of more advanced services. Nothing in this requirements document should contradict the specification, but this document describes SIP servers and user agents focused on implementation, not protocol elements. <p> For larger groups, the call should transition to a multicast or MCU-based call. If the call is a multicast call, it suffices to send an invitation with that multicast address to the party to be added to the call. See <ref> [4] </ref> for additional details on MCU-based calls and the transition from unicast to multicast calls. Unsupervised call transfer: A user should be able to transfer an existing call to any address. <p> Unsupervised call transfer: A user should be able to transfer an existing call to any address. Unsupervised call transfer is implemented by sending a BYE request to the calling party that contains a Location header pointing to the transfer destination. Supervised call transfer: See <ref> [4] </ref>. 3.6 Media Encodings Audio and video media agents SHOULD implement the revised RTP specification [6] and current profile. <p> There are several different ways to implement such a service <ref> [4] </ref>. A server-based approach that also works for calls connected through a GSTN gateway proceeds as follows: 1. The SIP server establishes an RTSP session with a designated RTSP-capable voice mail server and obtains the server's transport address. 2.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, SIP will be part of a generic telephony interface such as TAPI <ref> [7] </ref> or JTAPI [8]. However, these typically do not support the full range of SIP functionality (such as third-party call control and multicast signaling) and parameters (such as Priority and Subject or Location parameters). We can distinguish a protocol-oriented from a service-oriented API.

Reference-contexts: The documentation to follow borrows liberally from the Internet draft The WWW Common Gateway Interface: Version 1.2 <ref> [9] </ref>. Since these scripts invoke a new process for each incoming call, this interface may not be efficient for servers with very high volumes of calls. Other server script mechanism are for further study.
