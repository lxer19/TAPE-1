Reference-contexts: At the same time, the special case of finite (rather than finitely representable) states and Boolean queries has been the focus of a series of recent papers, including <ref> [10, 9, 1] </ref>. Our paper is devoted to studying of translation of extended locally generic queries into restricted ones. Of course, there are examples, when an extended locally generic query is not translated over all the finite database states into any restricted one. <p> We propose a general condition and give examples of using our techniques. Some examples are not new. Similar results were recently proved by Paradaens et al. [10] (Theorem 5.1) by a different method for the additive group of the real numbers and by Benedikt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> for o-minimal domains. - 2 - Our approach uses the idea from [1]. But our presentation is more elementary and more simple. Also we admit non-Boolean queries. Then we show that finitely representable order database states can indeed be represented by finite states with two-way FO translations (Theorem 2.13). <p> Some examples are not new.

Then we show that finitely representable order database states can indeed be represented by finite states with two-way FO translations (Theorem 2.13). The technique in this part works for an arbitrary linear order. <p> Q.E.D. - 7 - Theorem 2.5 If U is o-minimal, every locally generic for all the finite database states over U extended query is generic for all the pseudo-finite database states over V . So ( see <ref> [1] </ref>) if U is o-minimal, every locally generic for all the finite database states over U extended query is equal for all the finite database states over U to a restricted query. Proof: Consider the map h from Lemma 2.4.

Reference-contexts: Space limits imposed on this abstract, however, prevent us from discussing such applications any further. 1 Basic Notions We suppose the reader has a small background in Model theory and Algebra. Information about ultra-products and saturation is in <ref> [2] </ref>. A signature is a list of names. Each name has the arity or the number of argument places. The arity is finite for each name. Consider a fixed finite relational signature . Let L 0 = f&lt;g, L = f&lt;g [ . <p> P 1 ; : : : ; P s ) j= if and only if fi 2 ! : (U; a 1 (i); : : : ; a m (i); P 1 (i); : : : ; P s (i)) j= g 2 D: This is the Los Theorem (see <ref> [2] </ref>). A database query can formally be defined as a mapping that takes in a database state (of a fixed d.b. scheme), and produces a new relation, of a fixed arity, over U . Thus, every query has an arity. Specifically, queries of arity 0 are called Boolean.

Reference-contexts: However, the question of whether or not extended queries are more expressive than restricted ones, has remained open, and as Grumbach and Su <ref> [3] </ref> pointed out, ". . . there is a serious lack of proof techniques. . . " in this area.

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to increase the expressive power of queries. One of them is to add additional domain functions or relations. For example, in <ref> [5, 4] </ref> extended queries over the domain Q of rational numbers together with the relations = of equality and &lt; of the rational linear order and the usual operation + were considered. <p> Attempts to distinguish restricted queries and extended ones for the domain using specific combinatorial or spatial queries not in AC 0 |like parity, Eulerian traversal, or region connectivity|has been unsuccessful, and, finally, Grumbach et al. <ref> [5, 4] </ref> proved the AC 0 uniform data complexity for extended queries over finitely representable inputs with integer order constraints.

Reference-contexts: FO in L + 0 is called restricted. FO in L + is called extended. The simplest way is to use only restricted queries. But the expressive power of restricted queries in many domains is, however, too restricted, as it fails to express many practically important queries (cf. <ref> [8, 6] </ref>). There are several ways to increase the expressive power of queries. One of them is to add additional domain functions or relations.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a d.b. state essentially defines a structure of a larger signature with U as the domain; then a formula with n free variables defines an n-ary relation over U . Generally, a FO query may yield an infinite answer even in a finite d.b. state. <ref> [7] </ref> introduced the notion of finitely representable database state as a database state where every relation corresponding to a relation name from SC is defined (independently on the others) by a quantifier-free formula using the equality symbol, the name of the order relation, and names for elements of U .
