Title: Reasoning Under Varying and Uncertain Resource Constraints  
Author: Eric J. Horvitz

Abstract: We describe the use of decision-theory to optimize the value of computation under uncertain and varying resource limitations. The research is motivated by the pursuit of formal models of rational decision making for computational agents, centering on the explicit consideration of preferences and resource availability. We focus here on the importance of identifying the multiattribute structure of partial results generated by approximation methods for making control decisions. Work on simple algorithms and on the control of decision-theoretic inference itself is described.

Reference-contexts: u c (~v o ; r) = u o (~v o ) u i (r) 2 Toward a Continuum of Value Much of work on the analysis of algorithms has been directed at proving results about the time required for computing a solution defined by simple goals and termination conditions <ref> [1] </ref>. Although this perspective imposes useful simplification, it has biased synthesis and analysis toward solution policies that are indifferent to variation in the utility of a result or to the costs and availability of resources.

Reference-contexts: Several belief-network topologies have resisted tractable algorithmic solution. An example of a difficult class of problems is called the multiply-connected network. Inference with these graphs has been shown to be N P-hard <ref> [2] </ref>. Problems in complex areas such as medicine often require representation with multiply-connected networks. Thus, rational beliefs and actions may demand intractable computation.

We decompose u c into two components: the object-level utility, u o , and the inference-related utility, u i .

We have focused on problems with the control of decision-theoretic inference for making recommendations about action within complex, high-stakes domains such as medicine and aerospace. <p> Several partial-result strategies display interesting multiattribute trajectories with the commitment of additional resources. As in the sorting example, the structure of the trajectories of alternative strategies can influence the selection of an optimal reasoning strategy. See <ref> [5] </ref> for discussion of trajectories of belief refinement and for a view of default reasoning as a resource-constrained, partial-result strategy. 6 Discussion Our experimentation and analysis have highlighted several issues about reasoning under varying and uncertain resource constraints.
