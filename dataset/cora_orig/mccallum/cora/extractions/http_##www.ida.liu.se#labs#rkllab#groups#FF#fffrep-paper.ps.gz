Reference-contexts: Some representative references are: [27],[30], [32], [34], [37]. Additionally, the technique of "explanation closure" has very strong connections with syntactic-based approaches ([39], [40]). In fact, it is becoming increasingly more popular and can be explained in terms of circumscriptive reductions which provide a means for automatically generating closure axioms <ref> [3] </ref>. The operational-based approach appeals to the strong formal relation between the underlying semantics and the models associated with the temporal non-monotonic logics. <p> This work is reported in [4]. By restricting syntax for action types in PMON, it can even be shown that certain scenarios can be compiled into logic programs <ref> [3] </ref>. We are currently investigating the generic case of reducing 2nd-order circumscription axioms to equivalent 1st-order formulas. More about this in subsection 2.3.1. We are currently investigating the generic case of reducing 2nd-order circumscription axioms to equivalent 1st-order formulas. Initial results in this direction are promising.

Reference-contexts: Not only does PMON cover the broadest class of action scenarios considered so far in the Features and fluents framework, but it subsumes the other logics described in the book. This work is reported in <ref> [4] </ref>. By restricting syntax for action types in PMON, it can even be shown that certain scenarios can be compiled into logic programs [3]. We are currently investigating the generic case of reducing 2nd-order circumscription axioms to equivalent 1st-order formulas. More about this in subsection 2.3.1.

Reference-contexts: In Doherty and Lukaszewicz <ref> [6] </ref>, we provided syntactic characterizations of each of the logics of action and change in terms of classical FOL and circumscription axioms. The intent of the exercise was to take advantage of a number of reduction results which exist in the literature on circumscription.

Reference-contexts: In addition, both temporal prediction and postdiction reasoning tasks can be specified without restricting initial or final states to be completely specified. The major advantage of this approach is that it provides a basis for a straightforward and efficient implementation of a number of interesting ontological classes. In <ref> [8] </ref>, we have applied Dijkstra's methodology to formalize reasoning about deterministic actions.

Reference-contexts: The major advantage of this approach is that it provides a basis for a straightforward and efficient implementation of a number of interesting ontological classes. In [8], we have applied Dijkstra's methodology to formalize reasoning about deterministic actions. In <ref> [9] </ref> we have generalized the approach to actions where non-deterministic and indirect effects are allowed. 3.2.3 Reconstruction of known systems A number of practical software designs have been developed, in a more or less ad hoc manner, for action planning and to some extent for other reasoning operations.

Reference-contexts: Design methodology for intelligent autonomous robotic systems. 6. `Fuzzy'-related design principles for intelligent autonomous robotic systems. 7. Several industrial application projects. The first two of these topics are addressed using the Features and Fluents framework (FFF), which has been presented in a recent monograph <ref> [10] </ref>, as well as in a number of earlier articles. The present memo describes them only. <p> They have been reported in conference, journal, and handbook articles [11, 12, 13], and in a monograph that has appeared very recently <ref> [10] </ref>. The development of the coherent framework for the assessment-oriented approach has been a major part of that work. It included: * The definition of the underlying semantics. <p> In particular, we have investigated many of the different nonmonotonic temporal logics that are defined and assessed in Sandewall's book "Features and Fluents" <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They have been reported in conference, journal, and handbook articles <ref> [11, 12, 13] </ref>, and in a monograph that has appeared very recently [10]. The development of the coherent framework for the assessment-oriented approach has been a major part of that work. It included: * The definition of the underlying semantics.

Reference-contexts: A fair account of the state of the art in this area is found in the handbook article by Sandewall and Shoham in the Handbook of Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming <ref> [13] </ref>. Here we just add a few brief observations. A number of results on assessments or other validations of logics for actions and change have appeared in recent years. <p> They have been reported in conference, journal, and handbook articles <ref> [11, 12, 13] </ref>, and in a monograph that has appeared very recently [10]. The development of the coherent framework for the assessment-oriented approach has been a major part of that work. It included: * The definition of the underlying semantics.

Reference-contexts: Of course, termination does not mean that there doesn't exist an equivalent 1st-order formula, just that the algorithm can not generate one. More surprisingly, this algorithm provably subsumes existing reduction results in the literature, namely those of [32],[33], [34], [31], [26], and <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Choong-ho Yi is just completing a licentiate thesis where the range of applicability is analyzed for prototypical chronological minimization, PCM (with and without filtering), for a restricted case of concurrent actions, namely concurrent actions without interaction <ref> [15] </ref>. It seems a priori likely that PCM will apply to some cases of concurrent actions with interaction, and that the modified method also using occlusion will cover a significantly broader set of cases. We propose to continue his research in these directions.

Reference-contexts: Several approaches are being used for defining the set of intended conclusions: * Definition by another, monotonic axiomatization with a larger set of axioms. This method has been used by Lin and Shoham [22], Lifschitz [20], Kartha and Lifschitz <ref> [17] </ref>, and Lin and Reiter [21]. * Definition by an underlying semantics, which is formally specified and which identifies the set of intended models for a given scenario descrip tion.

Reference-contexts: The problem of ramification is also addressed in some present work by Erik Sandewall, where I define intended models for the ramification case using the variant of the approach of Kartha and Lifschitz <ref> [18] </ref>, and investigate range of applicability for other current methods on that basis. Silvia Coradeschi investigates he problem of scenarios with unreliable observations. We view this as a first attempt at a difficult problem which is of great practical importance.

Reference-contexts: This is the approach that we have used. * Definition by logical postulates, which specify necessary requirements on the relationship between the set of premises and the intended set of conclusions. This approach was first applied to actions and change (or the "update problem") by Katsuno and Mendelson <ref> [19] </ref>. Besides the present trend towards assessment and validation studies, there is also a continuing flow of proposals for new nonmonotonic logics without assessments, in particular those which provide new solutions to the classical problems of ramification, qualification, surprises, concurrency, and cause-effect chains.

Reference-contexts: Although complexity results regarding reasoning with minimal models are very discouraging, certain properties on formulas such as head-cycle freeness, provide for more efficient algorithms for the above reasoning tasks <ref> [23] </ref>. Although, not as easily classified under the model checking approach, we would also include in this class, research with specialized algorithms for computing preferred entailments such as those of Ginsberg [28] or Winslett [41]. The syntactic-based approach appeals to more conventional theorem-proving techniques in the following manner.

Reference-contexts: One can distinguish the following basic approaches to implementation: * Semantic-based approach * Syntactic-based approach * Operational-based approach The following discussion of these approaches will be restricted to logics with explicit time, omitting work based on modal-temporal logics for reasons of space. The semantics-based approach is related to model-checking <ref> [29] </ref>, but modified towards dealing with minimal models.

Results in this direction will also be useful for a number of situation calculus based approaches ([40], <ref> [35] </ref>). * Study how closure axioms in the context of the explanation closure technique can be automatically generated for theories via the reduction of circumscription axioms. 3.2.2 The operational-based approach An obvious similarity between actions and commands of programming languages, and between action scenarios and programs, suggests that it may 8
