Abstract: We introduce a new variant of the overlapping Schwarz method (OSM) for solving unsteady problems. In particular we study implicit methods ([FFL93, FS89, VM95]) for obtaining the time accurate solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized on two-dimensional unstructured meshes. When using implicit methods, a large, sparse linear system must be constructed and solved at each time step. Depending of the size of the time step, and several other flow parameters, the conditioning of the matrix may change from well-conditioned to mildly ill-conditioned. And due to the complexity of the flow pattern, at a given time step, the matrix may be ill-conditioned in certain subregions, for example near the airfoil, and relatively well-conditioned elsewhere. To solve these systems iteratively, it is necessary to have a family of preconditioners, such as OSM, whose strength can be adjusted locally in each subdomain according to the flow condition.

Reference-contexts: We use a mesh, Mesh48k, with 48792 nodes obtained by uniformly refining the mesh used in Test 1. Because of the page limit, we do not discuss the discretization, time stepping and mesh partitioning in this paper; interested reader should consult <ref> [CFS96] </ref> for details. In the implementation of VDS, we partition the mesh by using the recursive spectral bisection method. The sparse matrix is constructed at every time step, and stored in the Compressed Sparse Row format.

Reference-contexts: Let n be the total number of unknowns and N = f1; ; ng. To define algebraic Schwarz algorithms, see e.g. <ref> [CS96] </ref>, we first partition N into n 0 nonoverlapping subsets fN i g whose union is N . To generate an overlapping partitioning with overlap ovlp, we expand each subgrid N i by ovlp number of neighboring nodes, denoted as ~ N i .

Reference-contexts: This makes it very effective. In fact, M is a truncated series representation of (A (k) i ) 1 based on a splitting of A i into the sum of B (j) (k) (j) i . A discussion on a related polynomial preconditioning method can be found in <ref> [GO93] </ref>. We note that in a given subdomain, the number of GMRES iterations, or the degree of the polynomial, is determined by the conditioning of the local stiffness matrix. The multiplicative version can be constructed in a similar way.

Reference-contexts: The multiplicative version can be constructed in a similar way. We remark that since the preconditioner changes in the GMRES loop due to the stopping condition determined by ffi, it is generally more appropriate to use the flexible GMRES <ref> [Saa93] </ref>, which is slightly more expensive than the regular one.
