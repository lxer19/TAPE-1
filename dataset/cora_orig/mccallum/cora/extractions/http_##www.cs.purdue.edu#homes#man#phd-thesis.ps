Reference-contexts: When a query document is presented to the database, the terms in the documents are used to index the list of inverted indexes. The documents which contain 101 those terms are selected and further processing is performed only on those documents <ref> [VF95, ABGM90, CLC95, GGMT94, GGM95] </ref>. We are investigating extending this idea to images. The attributes of an image correspond to the terms of a text document. Each attribute is assocated with a list of images which contain that attribute.

Reference-contexts: The uncompressed data has lost some information but the data can be reconstructed so that it is very similar in content to the original. The resulting image is an approximation of the original. Our goal is to measure the amount of perceptible loss experienced by the image <ref> [ASB96] </ref>. Multiple quality levels can be defined according to the amount of data that is lost.

Reference-contexts: such a site is found, the query is redirected to that site. 6.8.3 Reducing Communication Time We have conducted experiments to illustrate the difference in communication between a site far away from the user and a site close to the user while retrieving images over a wide area network (WAN) <ref> [BA95] </ref>. <p> We have conducted extensive experiments <ref> [BA95] </ref> to measure the communication costs of transmitting image data over a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), and wide area network (WAN) and to compare the communication costs when transmitting lossy compressed and uncompressed data.

Reference-contexts: The multimedia information explosion combined with decreasing hardware and software costs has contributed to enormous amounts of multimedia data being part of these information systems. Access to these distributed multimedia information sources should be provided in an integrated manner in a digital library <ref> [BAG + 94] </ref>. The data in digital libraries is made up of the following media: text, images, video, and audio. The data represent documents, manuscripts, slides, movies, sound tracks, music, maps etc.

Reference-contexts: Also, digital libraries need to provide access to data over low bandwidth, low power mobile links, too <ref> [BAP95] </ref>. Some processing on the data is required to reduce the size of data and thus reduce the communication time. Data can be compressed to reduce its size. Compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression techniques result in a compression ratio of at most 4:1 [GCR92].

Reference-contexts: Computer vision techniques are used for image analysis and image understanding which together enable automated identification and extraction of objects and their relationships from an image. Image analysis involves feature extraction, segmentation and classification of images <ref> [BB82] </ref>. Image understanding includes symbolic interpretation and description of objects in an image. The information retrieval approach is used to search and retrieve data based on similarity matches [SM83, Sal89, SW90, FN75]. Image data are accessed and retrieved based on similarity with another image. <p> Only 60 colors are represented. We have 23 represented them in the histogram using numbers given in sequence and not by the actual triplet. In the image each color is associated with a triplet (R; G; B). 3.4.2 Texture Texture is a property of surfaces <ref> [BB82] </ref>. A "grainy" image, a "gridded" image (an image with a very fine grid) are examples of images described by texture. An image of sand is an example of a "grainy" image. Texture is determined by surface orientation.

Reference-contexts: The computed similarity measure is typically compared with a threshold to determine whether two images are similar or not. Similarity measures are often computed using weighted Euclidean distances though non-Euclidean measures have also been used <ref> [FBF + 94, BFM + 96, SS94] </ref>. 1.3.3 Query Types The different query types that have been investigated for an image database are: 6 * Text-based Query: Keywords which describe the image are used to access the image. <p> In such cases the dimensionality of the vectors is reduced using mathematical transformations such as the K-L transform and the DCT-transform. Other indexing methodologies include hash functions, grid files and optimizing linear 13 search using the triangle inequality <ref> [BFM + 96, SW90] </ref>. Efficient indexing still remains a difficult problem. 2.2 Image Database Models Expressiveness of the semantic descriptions of an image depend on the model. Object-oriented database models have been studied extensively for representing image attributes [GWJ91, OM88, CO96, CF80]. <p> The number of attributes determines the number of components of the vector and is referred to as the dimension of the feature vector. A dimension of over a 100 is very common [WJ96]. 32 Feature vectors with a dimension of 675 have been used in <ref> [BFM + 96] </ref>. Feature vector size of 768 has been reported in [STM97]. Feature vectors have high dimension since they contain information of several image attributes: color, texture and shape. The dimension of the color attributes alone can be a large number. <p> However, these transformations are not effective in indexing high-dimensional feature vectors which are uncorrelated for any given vector [BO97]. Also, these transformations and multidimensional index structures are not applicable to non-coordinate data <ref> [BFM + 96] </ref>. Another disadvantage is that these transformations treat the feature vectors as numbers without recognizing the relationships between them. The transformations are not feature-specific. Transforming the feature vector attributes into a smaller set of attributes is a feasible solution if retrieval effectiveness is maintained. <p> In the second pass the results from each of the databases have to be searched. Since these results are not known in advance, a special index structure cannot be used. Non-tree methods are also used to index non-coordinate, non-euclidean data <ref> [BFM + 96, BO97] </ref>. Document retrieval approaches have employed non-tree based or linear search techniques because their data is non-coordinate and non-euclidean. They are based on the assumption that the data satisfies the metric property, which is a weaker condition than Euclidean. <p> They are based on the assumption that the data satisfies the metric property, which is a weaker condition than Euclidean. The triangle inequality is used to reduce the number of similarity computations <ref> [SW90, BK73, BFM + 96] </ref>. Text-based techniques such as n-gram and inverted indexes have also been used to optimize linear search [KC94, SM83, Sal89]. Some work has been done on optimization in multimedia databases [CG96, CM94].

Reference-contexts: Tree-based index structures have been investigated for image databases. When a feature vector can be considered as multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional index structures have been used. A few examples are: the R-tree family <ref> [Gut84, SRF81, BKSS94] </ref>, K-D-B tree [Rob81], TV tree [LJF94, Jag97] etc. These multi-dimensional trees are not efficient in time and space for high dimensions. In such cases the dimensionality of the vectors is reduced using mathematical transformations such as the K-L transform and the DCT-transform. <p> Feature vector size of 768 has been reported in [STM97]. Feature vectors have high dimension since they contain information of several image attributes: color, texture and shape. The dimension of the color attributes alone can be a large number. Multi-dimensional index structures such as the R-tree family <ref> [Gut84, SRF81, BKSS94] </ref>, K-D-B tree [Rob81], TV tree [LJF94] etc. can be used to index multi-attribute feature vectors. These index structures do not scale well with dimension. R-trees can index up to 20 dimensions before there is an exponential increase in time and space [FSN + 95].

Reference-contexts: The database will be managed by the object-relational database, POSTGRES. 2.5 Feature Specific Systems The approaches by researchers vary according to the feature chosen for image data retrieval and the level of granularity of the chosen features. Some systems have used only color information to retrieve images <ref> [YHC94, BMK95, MKNM95, WNM + 95, Swa93, WK96, Lu96, Iok89, SB91] </ref>. Spatial constraints have been used to incorporate spatial information with color in [YHC94, SD96]. Color pixels are grouped together to form regions and have been extracted and represented as regions of color (along with regions of texture) [CBGM97].

Reference-contexts: Color attributes are related to each other. For example a light shade of red is similar to a dark shade of red. It is more similar to the dark shade of red than to a light shade of blue. There have been attempts to incorporate this crosstalk <ref> [BO97] </ref> in distance computation by modifying the Euclidean distance measure [Iok89, HSEN95]: Sim (I 1 ; I 2 ) = i=1 j=1 In this thesis we have used the Euclidean and Manhattan distances. 3.5.2 Qualitative Similarity Distance computations to determine the similarity between two data items have been used in areas <p> Several prototype systems have reduced feature vector dimensions using methods such as K-L transformation [Jai89], DCT transformation [Wal91], DFT transformation, and principal components analysis [NS96]. However, these transformations are not effective in indexing high-dimensional feature vectors which are uncorrelated for any given vector <ref> [BO97] </ref>. Also, these transformations and multidimensional index structures are not applicable to non-coordinate data [BFM + 96].

Color pixels are grouped together to form regions and have been extracted and represented as regions of color (along with regions of texture) <ref> [CBGM97] </ref>. Texture information has been used in [ZCA95, FSN + 95] and other systems which deal with animals and humans as they can be distinguished from other objects based on texture properties. Shape-based retrieval has been used in [MG95, Jag97, SEB95]. <p> Retrieve all images with the US flag flying at half-mast in the year 1997. The feature level attributes of color, texture and shape are associated with quantifiers which are the values of each of the attributes. They can also be associated with their location, and blobs <ref> [CBGM97] </ref> in the image. A blob is a region of the image which contains the attribute. For example, an image of the setting sun will have one red blob. Location is specified by geometric coordinates.

Reference-contexts: The number of images used range from as low as 100 to 2000.

They form an important component of digital libraries.

Reference-contexts: For example a query asking for an image of the sun should not be answered with an image containing an orange ball. The focus has been to extract more descriptive features <ref> [WK96, FMW97, LT96, KCH95] </ref>, to represent extracted features more accurately [NS96, Lah95], and to represent more relationships among image objects [GWJ91, GOC + 92].

Reference-contexts: For example, instead of typing a query "retrieve all images with 50% red", a query can be formulated on the user interface window by coloring half the the window red. This would enable the user to also specify shape and location of the color. For example, the QBIC <ref> [FSN + 95] </ref> system can take a sketch of a fox's head and retrieve all images which contain the similar shape and color. 1.3.3.1 Example Image Database Queries Some example of image database queries are: 1. Retrieve all images containing the American flag. 2. <p> Object-oriented database models have been studied extensively for representing image attributes [GWJ91, OM88, CO96, CF80]. VIMSYS [GWJ91] establishes relationships between semantic (non-computable) attributes of the image and computable features of those attributes [Gob97] and organizes a rich compositional hierarchy. Some approaches have used the relational data model <ref> [OS95, FSN + 95, RFS92] </ref>, especially the systems which use keyword-based indexing. In such cases the data model maps naturally onto the relational model. <p> these objectives has been studied with the goal of matching two images accurately. 2.4 Prototype Systems We describe prototype systems which represent the wide spectrum of systems available: complete systems, systems which focus on some special features, and domain specific systems. 14 2.4.1 QBIC The Query By Image Content (QBIC) <ref> [FSN + 95, FBF + 94] </ref> system developed at IBM can be considered to be one of the most complete image database systems.

R-trees can index up to 20 dimensions before there is an exponential increase in time and space <ref> [FSN + 95] </ref>. If the number of dimensions of the feature vectors is reduced, then data structures such as R-trees or even simpler data structures can be used to index the data. <p> The quantized image looks indistinguishable from the original. The original uses 32000 colors and the quantized image uses only 256 colors. Image database researchers have adopted similar techniques technique to quantize color feature vectors to reduce the number of attributes <ref> [Swa93, SS94, YHC94, FSN + 95, LL90] </ref> 38 39 The disadvantage of this scheme from the point of view of indexing in a database is that each image quantizes to a unique set of colors appropriate to retaining its quality.

Reference-contexts: Again, since image data can tolerate loss, lossy compression methods can be used to reduce the data by a ratio of up to 100:1 <ref> [GCR92] </ref>. Other operations include abstracting the information in an image into a small data item (a simple example of this would be a thumbnail version of an image), removing the color component of the image so that it is greyscale instead of color, reducing the resolution of the image etc. <p> Some processing on the data is required to reduce the size of data and thus reduce the communication time. Data can be compressed to reduce its size. Compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression techniques result in a compression ratio of at most 4:1 <ref> [GCR92] </ref>. Data compressed using lossless compression can be uncompressed so that the data recovered is exactly the same as the original. This is necessary for text data. However, visual data, like images and video, can be compressed using lossy compression techniques to achieve compression 83 ratios of upto 100:1 [GCR92]. <p> 4:1 <ref> [GCR92] </ref>.

Our goal is to measure the amount of perceptible loss experienced by the image [ASB96].

Reference-contexts: All these techniques reduce the size of the image and hence the transmission time. 1.4 Motivation There are several image database prototype systems available now. Some prototype systems will be discussed in the next chapter. Commercial systems include IBM's DB2 [TOH + 95] and Virage <ref> [Gup97] </ref>. The common approach is to extract features from the images and use them to index and search the database. 9 We have observed that these systems, especially the prototype systems have used only small test databases. The number of images used range from as low as 100 to 2000. <p> Images are retrieved using content-based retrieval. The features used for content-based retrieval are color, texture, shape, scene sketch, and location. Feature vectors are compared using modified Euclidean distances. Queries are specified by query-by-example and query-by-sketch. 2.4.2 VIMSYS The significant aspect of the Visual Information Management System (VIMSYS) <ref> [GWJ91, Gup97] </ref> is the representation of very rich semantic information and relationships in images. There are four different layers of semantic information: * Image Representations and Relations (IR): This layer represents the actual image data.

Reference-contexts: Tree-based index structures have been investigated for image databases. When a feature vector can be considered as multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional index structures have been used. A few examples are: the R-tree family <ref> [Gut84, SRF81, BKSS94] </ref>, K-D-B tree [Rob81], TV tree [LJF94, Jag97] etc. These multi-dimensional trees are not efficient in time and space for high dimensions. In such cases the dimensionality of the vectors is reduced using mathematical transformations such as the K-L transform and the DCT-transform. <p> Feature vector size of 768 has been reported in [STM97]. Feature vectors have high dimension since they contain information of several image attributes: color, texture and shape. The dimension of the color attributes alone can be a large number. Multi-dimensional index structures such as the R-tree family <ref> [Gut84, SRF81, BKSS94] </ref>, K-D-B tree [Rob81], TV tree [LJF94] etc. can be used to index multi-attribute feature vectors. These index structures do not scale well with dimension. R-trees can index up to 20 dimensions before there is an exponential increase in time and space [FSN + 95].

Many systems have used a combination of the different possible features and granularity levels. 16 2.6 Domain Specific Systems There have been successful attempts at developing image databases for specific domains. The domain indicates the type of image that will be stored in the database. <p> Some examples are area, perimeter, and a set of rectangles to cover the entire shape <ref> [Jag97] </ref>. Shape matching based on these properties cannot handle partially visible, overlapping, or touching objects since the feature representation has a global view of the image. * Local Features: These are the primitive, structural features of the shape's local regions.

Reference-contexts: Image processing is used for operations on the image data itself such as image compression, pattern recognition, noise removal, image reconstruction, image enhancement, and image restoration <ref> [DH73, Jai89] </ref>. Computer vision techniques are used for image analysis and image understanding which together enable automated identification and extraction of objects and their relationships from an image. Image analysis involves feature extraction, segmentation and classification of images [BB82]. <p> The presentation of data is also different. * The large size of image data results in expensive I/O operations, processing and memory requirements. 5 1.3.1 Characteristics of Image Data A digital image is an array of real or complex numbers called pixels <ref> [Jai89] </ref>. Each pixel is represented by a finite number of bits which contains the value of intensity and color (if it is a color image) of that pixel. <p> The dimension of multi-attribute data can be reduced by transforming the attributes in the feature vector into a smaller set which represents the original set of attributes. Several prototype systems have reduced feature vector dimensions using methods such as K-L transformation <ref> [Jai89] </ref>, DCT transformation [Wal91], DFT transformation, and principal components analysis [NS96]. However, these transformations are not effective in indexing high-dimensional feature vectors which are uncorrelated for any given vector [BO97]. Also, these transformations and multidimensional index structures are not applicable to non-coordinate data [BFM + 96].

Reference-contexts: The search of the answer set of the filter has to be linear. This is because the contents of the answer set for the low-dimensional set are not known in advance. Special index structures such as hB-trees <ref> [LS90] </ref> will have to include all attributes defeating the purpose of the filter. Their space requirements are also high. Hence there is a motivation to optimize linear search, which is the basis of the scheme described in this chapter. 54 There are other situations where a linear search is unavoidable. <p> Achieving this level of flexibility is a difficult problem. Index structures such as multi-attribute trees require some ordering of attributes. If an application orders the attributes differently because of a difference perceived in the relative importance of the attributes, the multi-attribute tree search becomes a linear search. Hb-trees 100 <ref> [LS90] </ref> have a high memory requirement. Multi-dimensional structures do not require this ordering but they do not scale well with dimensions. Our approach to supporting flexibility without affecting performance is to identify relationships among similarity criteria.

Reference-contexts: Texture information has been used in [ZCA95, FSN + 95] and other systems which deal with animals and humans as they can be distinguished from other objects based on texture properties. Shape-based retrieval has been used in <ref> [MG95, Jag97, SEB95] </ref>. Many systems have used a combination of the different possible features and granularity levels. 16 2.6 Domain Specific Systems There have been successful attempts at developing image databases for specific domains. The domain indicates the type of image that will be stored in the database. <p> The image is modeled in terms of the coefficients for a second order symmetric 24 25 26 multiresolution simultaneous autoregressive (MRSAR) process. The mean co efficients and LSE error are computed at three different scales. 3.4.3 Shape There are two approaches commonly followed to represent shape attributes <ref> [MG95] </ref>: * Global features: These properties depend on the entire shape. Some examples are area, perimeter, and a set of rectangles to cover the entire shape [Jag97]. <p> Some examples are boundary segments, points of maximal curvature change, elongation etc. Representation of shape depends on the properties which are chosen. The approach in <ref> [MG95] </ref> is to represent shape as a series of boundary segments and to represent each boundary segment as a series of boundary points called interest points. These interest points form the feature vector.

Reference-contexts: Only in a LAN the difference is not so significant. Figure 7.2 illustrates the difference in transmission times while transmitting compressed and uncompressed images in a WAN. 7.3 JPEG Compression We chose JPEG as our lossy compression technique [Wal91]. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group <ref> [MV94] </ref>, a standards committee that had its origins within the International Standard Organization (ISO). JPEG can be considered to be 85 86 a toolkit of image compression which the user can tailor to her use. JPEG is a lossy scheme and discards "useless" data during compression. <p> It is an excellent compression technique for continuous tone images such as photographs but does not work well for animations, black-and-white documents and other images where there are large regions of a single color <ref> [MV94] </ref>. A user can select the quality of JPEG compression using a parameter called a Q factor [MV94]. <p> is an excellent compression technique for continuous tone images such as photographs but does not work well for animations, black-and-white documents and other images where there are large regions of a single color <ref> [MV94] </ref>. A user can select the quality of JPEG compression using a parameter called a Q factor [MV94]. Different implementations have varying ways of specifying of Q factor, but the most common one is to give it a value in the range of 1 to 100 where 1 corresponds to the smallest, worst quality images and 100 to the largest, best quality images. <p> A Q factor of 75 is suggested as a good quality setting for all images by several implementations <ref> [MV94] </ref>. In this chapter we follow this scheme to represent quality levels. 10, 30, 50, 75 etc. refer to different quality levels ranging from bad to good. <p> The resolution of the chrominance channel is reduced by averaging together groups of pixels which is the downsampling process. The luminance channel is retained at full resolution 87 (1:1 sampling) while the chrominance channel is downsampled 2:1 horizontally and either 1:1 or 2:1 vertically <ref> [MV94] </ref>. * Discrete Cosine Transform: This step converts the spatial representation into the frequency representation. The image is divided into 8x8 blocks of pixels and a DCT is applied to each block.

Reference-contexts: For example a query asking for an image of the sun should not be answered with an image containing an orange ball. The focus has been to extract more descriptive features [WK96, FMW97, LT96, KCH95], to represent extracted features more accurately <ref> [NS96, Lah95] </ref>, and to represent more relationships among image objects [GWJ91, GOC + 92]. <p> Several prototype systems have reduced feature vector dimensions using methods such as K-L transformation [Jai89], DCT transformation [Wal91], DFT transformation, and principal components analysis <ref> [NS96] </ref>. However, these transformations are not effective in indexing high-dimensional feature vectors which are uncorrelated for any given vector [BO97]. Also, these transformations and multidimensional index structures are not applicable to non-coordinate data [BFM + 96].

Object-oriented database models have been studied extensively for representing image attributes <ref> [GWJ91, OM88, CO96, CF80] </ref>. VIMSYS [GWJ91] establishes relationships between semantic (non-computable) attributes of the image and computable features of those attributes [Gob97] and organizes a rich compositional hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Tree-based index structures have been investigated for image databases. When a feature vector can be considered as multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional index structures have been used. A few examples are: the R-tree family [Gut84, SRF81, BKSS94], K-D-B tree <ref> [Rob81] </ref>, TV tree [LJF94, Jag97] etc. These multi-dimensional trees are not efficient in time and space for high dimensions. In such cases the dimensionality of the vectors is reduced using mathematical transformations such as the K-L transform and the DCT-transform. <p> Feature vectors have high dimension since they contain information of several image attributes: color, texture and shape. The dimension of the color attributes alone can be a large number. Multi-dimensional index structures such as the R-tree family [Gut84, SRF81, BKSS94], K-D-B tree <ref> [Rob81] </ref>, TV tree [LJF94] etc. can be used to index multi-attribute feature vectors. These index structures do not scale well with dimension. R-trees can index up to 20 dimensions before there is an exponential increase in time and space [FSN + 95].

Reference-contexts: All these techniques reduce the size of the image and hence the transmission time. 1.4 Motivation There are several image database prototype systems available now. Some prototype systems will be discussed in the next chapter. Commercial systems include IBM's DB2 <ref> [TOH + 95] </ref> and Virage [Gup97]. The common approach is to extract features from the images and use them to index and search the database. 9 We have observed that these systems, especially the prototype systems have used only small test databases.

Reference-contexts: When a query document is presented to the database, the terms in the documents are used to index the list of inverted indexes. The documents which contain 101 those terms are selected and further processing is performed only on those documents <ref> [VF95, ABGM90, CLC95, GGMT94, GGM95] </ref>. We are investigating extending this idea to images. The attributes of an image correspond to the terms of a text document. Each attribute is assocated with a list of images which contain that attribute.

Reference-contexts: The dimension of multi-attribute data can be reduced by transforming the attributes in the feature vector into a smaller set which represents the original set of attributes. Several prototype systems have reduced feature vector dimensions using methods such as K-L transformation [Jai89], DCT transformation <ref> [Wal91] </ref>, DFT transformation, and principal components analysis [NS96]. However, these transformations are not effective in indexing high-dimensional feature vectors which are uncorrelated for any given vector [BO97]. Also, these transformations and multidimensional index structures are not applicable to non-coordinate data [BFM + 96]. <p> We can make the same observation in a WAN (Figure 6.4). Only in a LAN the difference is not so significant. Figure 7.2 illustrates the difference in transmission times while transmitting compressed and uncompressed images in a WAN. 7.3 JPEG Compression We chose JPEG as our lossy compression technique <ref> [Wal91] </ref>. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group [MV94], a standards committee that had its origins within the International Standard Organization (ISO). JPEG can be considered to be 85 86 a toolkit of image compression which the user can tailor to her use. <p> The image is divided into 8x8 blocks of pixels and a DCT is applied to each block. The resulting 64 coefficients contain one value representing the average value of the block and the 63 values representing the amplitude across the height and width of the block <ref> [Wal91] </ref>. The objective of the transformation is to separate the high and low frequency information in the image. High frequency data can be discarded without losing low-frequency information. * Quantization: This is the lossy step. Each of the DCT coefficients is divided by a quantization factor.

Reference-contexts: Each component of the feature vector represents one attribute of the image. The value in the component represents the value associated with that attribute in the image. 3.4.1 Color There are various color models available. RGB, CMY, YIQ, YUV, HSV, and HLS are some examples <ref> [Wat89] </ref>. We briefly describe the RGB and YIQ models. 3.4.1.1 The RGB Model The RGB model is the standard monitor model. A computer graphics monitor is driven by three (R; G; B) intensity signals.

Reference-contexts: The number of attributes in a feature vector can be of the order of hundreds. The number of attributes determines the number of components of the vector and is referred to as the dimension of the feature vector. A dimension of over a 100 is very common <ref> [WJ96] </ref>. 32 Feature vectors with a dimension of 675 have been used in [BFM + 96]. Feature vector size of 768 has been reported in [STM97]. Feature vectors have high dimension since they contain information of several image attributes: color, texture and shape.

Reference-contexts: For example a query asking for an image of the sun should not be answered with an image containing an orange ball. The focus has been to extract more descriptive features <ref> [WK96, FMW97, LT96, KCH95] </ref>, to represent extracted features more accurately [NS96, Lah95], and to represent more relationships among image objects [GWJ91, GOC + 92]. <p> The database will be managed by the object-relational database, POSTGRES. 2.5 Feature Specific Systems The approaches by researchers vary according to the feature chosen for image data retrieval and the level of granularity of the chosen features. Some systems have used only color information to retrieve images <ref> [YHC94, BMK95, MKNM95, WNM + 95, Swa93, WK96, Lu96, Iok89, SB91] </ref>. Spatial constraints have been used to incorporate spatial information with color in [YHC94, SD96]. Color pixels are grouped together to form regions and have been extracted and represented as regions of color (along with regions of texture) [CBGM97].

Reference-contexts: Several early prototypes such as <ref> [Swa93, YHC94, RS89, RS96] </ref> experimented with small databases with a few hundred images and thus linear search was sufficient.
