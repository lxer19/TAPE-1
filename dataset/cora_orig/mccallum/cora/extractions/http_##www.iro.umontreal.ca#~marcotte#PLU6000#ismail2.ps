Abstract: This paper solves what appears to be a 30 years old problem dealing with the discovery of most efficient algorithms possible to compute all-to-one shortest paths in discrete dynamic networks. This problem lies at the heart of efficient solution approaches to dynamic network models that arise in dynamic transportation systems, such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), applications. While the main objective of this paper is the study of the all-to-one dynamic shortest paths problem, one-to-all fastest paths problems are studied as well. Early results are revisited and new properties are established. We establish the exact complexity of these problems and develop optimal, in the run time sense, solution algorithms. A new and simple solution algorithm is proposed for all-to-one all departure time intervals shortest path problems. It is proved, theoretically, that the new solution algorithm has an optimal run time complexity that equals the complexity of the problem. Computer implementations and experimental evaluations of various solution algorithms support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution algorithm. We expect our findings to be of major benefit to research and development activities in the field of dynamic, in particular real-time, management and control of large-scale Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

Reference-contexts: Arc travel times may possess some properties useful in studying and developing algorithms for dynamic networks. A well celebrated property is the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) condition <ref> (Kaufman and Smith, 1993) </ref> which may be defined in various mathematical forms. For instance, the FIFO condition is valid if and only if the following system of inequalities holds: When the FIFO condition holds, we say that the dynamic network is FIFO.

Reference-contexts: Depending on how time is treated, dynamic shortest paths problems can be further subdivided into two types: discrete and continuous. In discrete dynamic networks, time is modelled as a set of integers. In continuous dynamic networks <ref> (Orda and Rom, 1991) </ref>, time is treated as real numbers. It is important to mention that a discrete dynamic network can alternatively be viewed as a static network obtained by using a time-space expansion representation. The size of the equivalent representation depends on the waiting policy at nodes.
