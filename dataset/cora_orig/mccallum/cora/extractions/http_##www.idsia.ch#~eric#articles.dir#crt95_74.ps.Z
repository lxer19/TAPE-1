Reference-contexts: For a recent overview of algorithms for the CVRP, see Laporte <ref> [1] </ref>. A special case of the CVRP is the mTraveling Salesman Problem (m TSP) in which Q is arbitrarily large. In both these problems, it is implicitly assumed that each vehicle is used for only one route. In some cases, however, multiple use of vehicles is allowed.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, however, multiple use of vehicles is allowed. This gives rise to the CVRP with Multiple Use of Vehicles (CVRPM) and to the mTSP with Multiple Use of Vehicles (m TSPM) (see, e.g., Fleischmann <ref> [2] </ref> and Taillard, Laporte and Gendreau [3]). In both the CVRPM and the m TSPM, several vehicle routes can be assigned to the same vehicle to form a working day, but the total distance driven by any vehicle may not exceed a preset limit L.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, however, multiple use of vehicles is allowed. This gives rise to the CVRP with Multiple Use of Vehicles (CVRPM) and to the mTSP with Multiple Use of Vehicles (m TSPM) (see, e.g., Fleischmann [2] and Taillard, Laporte and Gendreau <ref> [3] </ref>). In both the CVRPM and the m TSPM, several vehicle routes can be assigned to the same vehicle to form a working day, but the total distance driven by any vehicle may not exceed a preset limit L. <p> For the minmax CVRPM, we took the same instances as above, and the same values of m as in Taillard, Laporte and Gendreau <ref> [3] </ref>. The various problem parameters, the values of m that were effectively tested, 7 and the optimal (mincost) CVRP solution values z fl are provided in Table 1. A total of 91 instances are described in Table 1: 22 CVRPs, 17 mTSPs, and 52 CVRPMs.

Reference-contexts: Relatively little attention has been paid to minmax routing problems. Some simple heuristics with worst-case 1 behavior ratios of m + (m=2) log n and 5=2 1=m are provided by Frederickson, Hecht and Kim <ref> [4] </ref> in the case of the minmax m TSP. The same problem is solved by means of a tabu search heuristic and of exact dichotomous search scheme by Fran~ca et al. [5]. To our knowledge, the minmax CVRP, m TSPM and CVRPM have not yet been solved.

Reference-contexts: The same problem is solved by means of a tabu search heuristic and of exact dichotomous search scheme by Fran~ca et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. To our knowledge, the minmax CVRP, m TSPM and CVRPM have not yet been solved. Our purpose is to propose a tabu search based heuristic for these minmax routing problems. We will first describe the algorithm for the minmax CVRP, its application to the minmax mTSP being straightforward. <p> Conclusion We have implemented and tested two Adaptive Memory heuristics for three classes of minmax routing problems. In the case of the minmax m TSP the only known computational study appears to be that of Fran~ca et al. <ref> [5] </ref> and it only reports results for asymmetric instances. No previous algorithm is known for the minmax CVRP and CVRPM. Our results indicate that the proposed procedures yield high quality solutions within reasonable computing times.

Reference-contexts: Heuristic for the Minmax mTSP and CVRP Tabu search has been applied successfully by a number of researchers to the solution of the classical CVRP and some of its variants. Some of the best implementations are those of Taillard <ref> [6] </ref>, of Gendreau, Hertz and Laporte [7] and of Rego and Roucairol [8]. Recently Taillard has proposed an Adaptive Memory Procedure (AMP) that can be used to enhance the search in several local search algorithms. <p> An application of this method to the CVRP and to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows is presented in Rochat and Taillard [9]. In order to describe how AMP was applied to the minmax CVRP we need to first summarize Taillard's <ref> [6] </ref> tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with capacity and distance restrictions, and some modifications that were made to this algorithm for the minmax CVRP. 2 The algorithm starts from partial initial solution containing up to m feasible routes and possibly some unserviced customers. <p> We now proceed to a more detailed description of the algorithm. Step 1 (Initial CVRP solutions). Repeat the following operations p times: i) Initially, no customer is serviced. ii) Apply the improvement phase of the original Taillard algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> with q applications of the decomposition process. Here we allow as many routes as necessary so that the solution is always feasible. iii) Insert in a list each route of the solution labeled with its total cost. Step 2 (Generation of new CVRP solutions).

Reference-contexts: Some of the best implementations are those of Taillard [6], of Gendreau, Hertz and Laporte [7] and of Rego and Roucairol <ref> [8] </ref>. Recently Taillard has proposed an Adaptive Memory Procedure (AMP) that can be used to enhance the search in several local search algorithms. Basically, AMP operates by first producing several solutions by means of a heuristic, and then combines these solutions to produce new ones, using probabilistic rules.

Reference-contexts: When used in conjunction with tabu search, AMP produces a strong diversification and intensification effect that enriches the search and directs it towards high quality solutions. An application of this method to the CVRP and to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows is presented in Rochat and Taillard <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: (v i 1 ; v j 2 ) to create the first route, and arcs (v 0 ; v i 2 ), (v j 1 ; v 0 ) to create the second route. 3 To generate an initial solution, we propose the following modified Clarke and Wright procedure (see <ref> [10] </ref> for the original description). The idea is to try and construct m vehicle routes whose maximal length is as close as possible to a known lower bound on the minmax cost. To achieve this, several trials may be necessary.
