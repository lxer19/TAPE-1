Reference-contexts: A preconditioned conjugate gradient method can be used for symmetric, positive definite systems. For symmetric indefinite systems, the preconditioned SYMMLQ algorithm may be used. 2 For nonsymmetric systems, the GMRES method may be used. In addition, the PETSc software package <ref> [1] </ref> contains an interface to the BlockSolve95 preconditioners; this interface may be used if other iterative methods are required. For basic information on iterative methods, see [2]. You can select from a number of different preconditioners. <p> BlockSolve95 uses the same makefile system as PETSc <ref> [1] </ref>. The README file in the main directory gives details on how to build the libraries. The makefiles will build the BlockSolve95 library in a subdirectory of the lib directory based on the machine architecture and the level of optimization. <p> A balanced coloring heuristic that addresses this situation is described in [3]; however, this heuristic is not yet included in BlockSolve95. 29 10 Related Software A number of software packages are closely related to BlockSolve95 and may be of use in par ticular applications. * The software package PETSc <ref> [1] </ref> contains an interface to BlockSolve95. It can be used to access a larger number of iterative solvers, nonlinear methods, and a large number of other useful features.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the PETSc software package [1] contains an interface to the BlockSolve95 preconditioners; this interface may be used if other iterative methods are required. For basic information on iterative methods, see <ref> [2] </ref>. You can select from a number of different preconditioners. The first is a simple diagonal scaling of the matrix, which can be used by itself or in conjunction with another preconditioner. <p> The storage format for these arrays corresponds to the standard compressed row storage (CRS) scheme for sparse matrices. See pages 58-69 of <ref> [2] </ref> for a detailed discussion of various sparse storage schemes. Each processor uses the local numbering of its rows 0; 1; : : :; n p 1 to index these arrays.

Reference-contexts: This imbalance in the number of processors could degrade performance. A balanced coloring heuristic that addresses this situation is described in <ref> [3] </ref>; however, this heuristic is not yet included in BlockSolve95. 29 10 Related Software A number of software packages are closely related to BlockSolve95 and may be of use in par ticular applications. * The software package PETSc [1] contains an interface to BlockSolve95.

Reference-contexts: The MPI message-passing standard <ref> [4, 13] </ref> is used to achieve portability across architectures. Machines on which BlockSolve95 has been tested include the IBM SP series, the Cray T3D and T3E, the SGI Cray Origin2000, the HP-Convex Exemplar, the Intel Paragon, and networks of Sun, SGI, DEC alpha, and HP workstations.

Reference-contexts: Instead, BlockSolve95 assumes that the given partitioning is a good one. As such, its performance may be limited by the quality of the partitioning. We assume that the right-hand side and the solution vector are partitioned in the same manner as the rows of the sparse matrix. See <ref> [5] </ref> for more information on partitioning heuristics. We achieve parallelism in the conjugate gradient, SYMMLQ, and GMRES implementations by partitioning the vectors used in these algorithms in the same manner that the rows of the matrix are partitioned across the processors.
