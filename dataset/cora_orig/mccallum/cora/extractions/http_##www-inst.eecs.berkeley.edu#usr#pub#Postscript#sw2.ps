Reference-contexts: Should any incompatibilities come up, please contact SWITCAP Distribution Center immediately. Internally, SWITCAP2 consists of several different algorithms depending on the type of desired analysis. For time- and frequency-domain analyses (excluding group delay and sensitivity analyses) of linear SCN's, SWITCAP2 uses an algorithm based on the formulation published in <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] </ref>. This formulation, which was incorporated in the original SWITCAP [6, 7], uses a set of charge variables as the network variables for computation. The number of charge variables is typically very small.

Reference-contexts: The analytical expressions that allow exact analyses of group delay and sensitivity for many-phase linear SCN's are derived from the above mentioned state charge variable formulation <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. The analytical expressions not only lead to efficient algorithms for computing the group delay and sensitivity but also retain efficiencies similar to those that were realized for simple time- and frequency-domain analyses using the state charge formulation.
