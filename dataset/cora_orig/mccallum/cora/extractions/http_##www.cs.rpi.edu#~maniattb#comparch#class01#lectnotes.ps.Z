Reference-contexts: A. Maniatty 28 Averaging defined Dept. of Computer Science, Rensselaer 28 Averaging defined Jain <ref> [1] </ref> defines the average as the central tendency of the data. Distributions showing relationship between mean median and mode Computer Architectures 75425 W. A. <p> A. Maniatty 32 How To Choose a Mean? Dept. of Computer Science, Rensselaer 32 How To Choose a Mean? Jain <ref> [1] </ref> recommends that when the values being averaged are NOT a ratio: * Select the arithmetic mean when the sum of values is of interest. * Select the geometric mean when the product of values is of interest. Computer Architectures 75425 W. A. <p> Computer Architectures 75425 W. A. Maniatty 33 Taking the Mean of a Ratio? Dept. of Computer Science, Rensselaer 33 Taking the Mean of a Ratio? Jain <ref> [1] </ref> recommends that when averaging a ratio: 1. If the sums of numerators and denominators both have a physical meaning, the average of the ratio is the ratio of the averages.
