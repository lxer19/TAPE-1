Title: The Paradoxical Success of Fuzzy Logic

Abstract: This paper investigates the question of which aspects of fuzzy logic are essential to its practical usefulness. As a formal system, a standard version of fuzzy logic collapses mathematically to two-valued logic, and there appear to be no published reports of expert systems in real-world use that reason about uncertainty using fuzzy logic. Nevertheless, applications of fuzzy logic in heuristic control have been highly successful. It appears that the limitations of fuzzy logic have not been detrimental in control applications because current fuzzy controllers are far simpler than other knowledge-based systems. In the future, the technical limitations of fuzzy logic can be expected to become important in practice, and work on fuzzy controllers will also encounter several problems of scale already known for other knowledge-based systems.

Reference-contexts: Heuristic control techniques give up mathematical simplicity and performance guarantees in exchange for increased realism and better performance in practice. A heuristic controller using fuzzy logic is shown to have less overshoot and quicker settling in <ref> [ Burkhardt and Bonissone, 1992 ] </ref> for example. The first demonstrations that fuzzy logic could be used in building heuristic controllers were published in the 1970s [ Zadeh, 1973; Mamdani and Assilian, 1975 ] . <p> Human engineers or learning algorithms can do this tuning; neural network methods have been especially successful [ Keller and Tahani, 1992 ] . What the algorithms used for tuning fuzzy controllers themselves have in common is that they are gradient-descent "hill-climbing" algorithms that learn by local optimization <ref> [ Burkhardt and Bonissone, 1992 ] </ref> . * Last but not least, by definition fuzzy controllers use the operators of fuzzy logic. Typically minimum and maximum are used, as are explicit possibility distributions (usually trapezoidal), and some fuzzy implication operator.

Reference-contexts: original motivation for using fuzzy logic in building heuristic controllers was that fuzzy logic is designed to capture human statements involving vague quantifiers such as "considerable." More recently, a consensus has developed that research must focus on obtaining "procedures for fuzzy controller design based on fuzzy models of the process" <ref> [ Driankov and Eklund, 1991 ] </ref> . Mainstream work on knowledge engineering, however, has already transcended the dichotomy between rule-based and model-based reasoning. Expert systems whose knowledge consists of if-then rules have at least two disadvantages.

One reason why fuzzy controllers have attracted so much interest recently is that they can be implemented by embedded specialized microprocessors [ Yamakawa, 1989 ] .

A quote from the originator of fuzzy heuristic control is relevant here <ref> [ Mamdani and Sembi, 1980 ] </ref> : : : : it should be remarked that the work on process control using fuzzy logic was inspired as much by Waterman and his approach to rule-based decision making as by Zadeh [1973] and his novel theory of fuzzy subsets.

Reference-contexts: Rather, uncertainty of some sort is attached to them. Fuzzy logic is an attempt to capture valid patterns of reasoning about uncertainty. The notion is now well accepted that there exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance <ref> [ Smets, 1991 ] </ref> . However, there is still debate as to what types of uncertainty are captured by fuzzy logic.

Reference-contexts: Almost all currently deployed heuristic controllers using fuzzy logic are similar in five important aspects. A good description of a prototypical example of this standard architecture appears in <ref> [ Sugeno et al., 1989 ] </ref> . * First, the knowledge base of a typical fuzzy controller consists of under 100 rules; often 6 under 20 rules are used.

One reason why fuzzy controllers have attracted so much interest recently is that they can be implemented by embedded specialized microprocessors [ Yamakawa, 1989 ] .

Reference-contexts: One reason why fuzzy controllers have attracted so much interest recently is that they can be implemented by embedded specialized microprocessors <ref> [ Yamakawa, 1989 ] </ref> . Despite the intense industrial interest (and, in Japan, consumer interest) in fuzzy logic, the technology continues to meet resistance.

Reference-contexts: A heuristic controller using fuzzy logic is shown to have less overshoot and quicker settling in [ Burkhardt and Bonissone, 1992 ] for example. The first demonstrations that fuzzy logic could be used in building heuristic controllers were published in the 1970s <ref> [ Zadeh, 1973; Mamdani and Assilian, 1975 ] </ref> . Work using fuzzy logic in heuristic control continued through the 1980s, and recently there has been an explosion of industrial interest in this area; for surveys see [ Yamakawa and Hirota, 1989 ] and [ Lee, 1990 ] .
