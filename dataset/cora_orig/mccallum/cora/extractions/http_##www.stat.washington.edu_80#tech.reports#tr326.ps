Reference-contexts: In Dasgupta and Raftery (1998) the assumption is made that the regions of high density are formed by a mixture of Gaussian distributions on a background Poisson process and model-based clustering <ref> (Banfield and Raftery 1993) </ref> is used to segment the data. This method is particularly suited to finding very linear features or those approximated by linear forms.

Reference-contexts: For example, the high intensity regions are captured with good detail and sharp edges. There is an apparent difference between this and the results of existing non-locally adaptive kernel smoothing methods. For example the above methods implemented in the Splus spatial statistics module <ref> (Diggle 1983) </ref> do not allow for a predominantly smooth estimate that also recovers the very localized regions of high intensity. They also do not provide variability estimates.

Reference-contexts: The algorithms are of the Metropolis-Hastings type, (Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller 1953; Hastings 1970), which have as a special case the Gibbs sampler <ref> (Geman and Geman 1984) </ref>. 4 The samples obtained by these methods from the posterior distributions can then be used to form estimates of the intensity of the process or other quantities of interest. 3.2.1 Fixed Number of Tiles First we consider the simple case where we use a fixed number of

Reference-contexts: Our proposal, which is also nonparametric, goes beyond this in that it provides formal probabilistic statements of uncertainty about the intensity, and provides an explicit model for segmentation and feature detection. Parametric models have also been used for intensity estimation in nonhomogeneous Poisson processes <ref> (Ogata and Katsura 1988) </ref>; our approach here makes no parametric assumptions about the functional form of the intensity. Often point process data come with some form of additional information in the form of marks.
