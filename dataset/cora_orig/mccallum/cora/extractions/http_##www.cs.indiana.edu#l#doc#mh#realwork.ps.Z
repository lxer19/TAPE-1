Abstract: The UCI version of the Rand Message Handling System (MH) is discussed. MH is a powerful user agent which operates in the ARPA Internet and UUCP environments. In addition to the usual functions provided by similar programs, MH has several distinguishing characteristics which give the user additional message handling capability. In particular, MH provides mechanisms for maintaining an organized mail environment, tailoring its behavior, and extending its functions. This document describes MH from several perspectives. Particular emphasis is given to: the MH user environment, advanced features of MH which have proven to be particularly useful for sophisticated users of electronic mail, the user interface issues in MH, and the mh.5 distribution. The paper concludes with a summary of the authors' experiences with MH, and a discussion of future areas of enhancement.

Reference-contexts: To solve this problem, a network node which can support a message transport entity (known as service host) offers a maildrop service to these less endowed nodes (known as client hosts). The Post Office Protocol <ref> [JReyn84] </ref> (POP) is intended to permit a workstation to dynamically access a maildrop on a service host to pick-up mail. 4 The level of access includes the ability to determine the number of messages in the maildrop and the size of each message, as well as to retrieve and delete individual <p> Using this search-list, when an MH user posts a draft, the post program will attempt to establish an SMTP connection with each host in the search-list to post the message until it succeeds. Initial 4 Actually, there are three different descriptions of the POP. The first, cited in <ref> [JReyn84] </ref>, was the original description of the protocol, which suffered from certain problems. Since then, two alternate descriptions have been developed. The official revision of the POP [MButl85], and the revision of the POP which MH uses (which is documented in an internal memorandum in the MH release).

Reference-contexts: The failed draft may then be extracted with the burst program (discussed later).

Reference-contexts: Burst will also extract forwarded messages generated by forw (or the forwarded message in the error report generated by push, as described above). Although burst cannot always decapsulate messages encapsulated by sites not running MH, it adheres to the proposed standard described in <ref> [MRose85b] </ref>. 3 When the message transport system delivers a message to a user it stores it in a single file, called a maildrop. Since many messages may be present in a single maildrop, (in theory) there is a unique string acting as a separator between messages in the maildrop.
