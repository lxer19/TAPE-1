Abstract: We propose and analyze a specific set of access rules, or spectrum etiquette, for the 59-64 GHz unlicensed band to allow systems from different manufacturers with different physical and medium-access control protocols to co-exist, sharing the large available bandwidth without interference. The proposed etiquette is unique in that heterogeneous systems are able to co-exist with one another, without monitoring the entire band, by means of transmissions over a common, narrow band control channel used to establish collision-free transmission schedules over the channels allocated for data transmission within the 59-64 GHz band. Because no common physical layer can be assumed among different systems, the control channel is needed for the systems to schedule transmissions in the rest of the band, and the only means by which systems can communicate with one another over the control channel is the duration of each others' transmissions, which are perceived only as noise. A transmission encoding is defined based on this basic feedback to allow systems to ascertain which system can use which data channel at which time without interference. Analytical and simulation results are presented showing that the proposed etiquette is fair to all the co-existing systems, fully utilizes the spectrum, provides bounded delays for data-channel acquisition time by any given system, and provides minimum channel-use guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Because of the desirability of providing channel-assignment delay guarantees, we designed our etiquette using a deterministic tree-splitting collision resolution algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> tailored for the case in which the number of systems competing for the available data channels is finite. Fig. 1 shows an example of an etiquette frame with three channel-control periods suitable for a band with three data channels.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made available 6:2 GHz of spectrum and established technical rules that permit the introduction and development of communications technologies in the millimeter wave frequency bands above 40 GHz <ref> [4] </ref>. Europe and Japan are also considering commercial uses of millimeter wave technology. The term millimeter wave is taken from the fact that the wavelength of radio signals between 30 GHz and 300 GHz ranges from 10 millimeters down to 1 millimeter. <p> The main challenge in the definition of such an etiquette is the huge bandwidth that is being made available, which precludes systems from listening over the entire band to try to prevent interference. According to the FCC regulations <ref> [4] </ref>, within the 59-64 GHz band, the power density of any emission shall not exceed 9W=cm 2 at a distance of 3 meters. <p> The power measurements will be average measurements based on a 1 MHz bandwidth. Within this constraints, the etiquette should fulfill the following requirements <ref> [4, 6] </ref>: * The etiquette should provide a substantial reduction in the probability of interference between co-existing systems. * The etiquette should seek to promote realization of high-speed communications while attempting not to foreclose low speed communications. * The etiquette should be flexible enough to allow as many applications as possible
