Reference-contexts: While the idea of traversing links was intuitively attractive, it made it difficult to express database interactions independently of the actual algorithms that were need to implement them. In 1970, Ted Codd published a landmark paper <ref> [Codd70] </ref> that suggested that data could be managed at a much higher level by conceptualizing it in terms of mathematical relations. This paper sparked a great deal of interest within the research community thoughout the 1970's to make this notion practical.

Reference-contexts: It would be extremely useful to have DBMS facilities such as indexing and querying available for use on e-mail. While some support for a more organized approach to storage and retrieval of e-mail is emerging (e.g., Lotus Notes), sophisticated querying is not well developed. Other recent reports <ref> [Gray95, SSU91, SSU95] </ref> have charted the course of database research and did an excellent job prioritizing current research topics and delineating new influences with respect to their impact on the database system industry. This report takes a somewhat different tack.
