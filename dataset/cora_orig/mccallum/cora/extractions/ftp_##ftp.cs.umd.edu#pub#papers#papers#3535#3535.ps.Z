Abstract: In a recent paper, Chang and Paige have shown that the usual perturbation bounds for Cholesky factors can systematically overestimate the errors. In this note we sharpen their results and extend them to the factors of the LU decomposition. The results are based on a new formula for the first order terms of the error in the factors. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

However, if the diagonal matrices D L and D U are chosen appropriately, ( ^ L) and ( ^ U ) can be far less that (L) or (U ). <p> Thus the strategy is to so scale ^ L and ^ U and use a condition estimator to estimate the condition of L, ^ L, U , ^ U . In <ref> [4] </ref> it is shown how to obtain rigorous bounds for the errors in the first order approximations F L and F U .

Reference-contexts: The matrix 2-norm, which is not absolute, will be denoted by kk 2 . For any nonsingular matrix X we will define - (X) = kXk -kX 1 k -: For more on norms see <ref> [5] </ref>. 2. The LU Decomposition Let A be a matrix of order n whose leading principal submatrices are nonsingular. Then A can be written in the form A = LU; where L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular.

Reference-contexts: Poorly scaled but essentially well-conditioned matrices like U in (2.7) occur naturally. If A is ill-conditioned and the LU decomposition of A is computed with pivoting, the ill-conditioning of A will usually reveal itself in the diagonal elements of U . In <ref> [6] </ref> the author has shown that such upper triangular matrices are artificially ill conditioned in the sense that they can be made well conditioned by scaling their rows.

Reference-contexts: However, if p si small, the perturbation will show up in F U , for which the factor is 1 p. The bounds (2.5) and (2.6) suggest a strategy for estimating the condition of the LU factorizations. Van der Sluis <ref> [8] </ref> has shown that in the 2-norm, the condition number is approximately minimized when the rows or columns of the matrix are scaled to have norm one.
