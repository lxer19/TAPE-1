Abstract: CODE 2.0 is a graphical parallel programming system that targets the three goals of ease of use, portability, and production of efficient parallel code. Ease of use is provided by an integrated graphical/textual interface, a powerful dynamic model of parallel computation, and an integrated concept of program component reuse. Portability is approached by the declarative expression of synchronization and communication operators at a high level of abstraction in a manner which cleanly separates overall computation structure from the primitive sequential computations that make up a program. Execution efficiency is approached through a systematic class hierarchy that supports hierarchical translation refinement including special case recognition. This paper reports results obtained through experimental use of a prototype implementation of the CODE 2.0 system. CODE 2.0 represents a major conceptual advance over its predecessor systems (CODE 1.0 and CODE 1.2) in terms of the expressive power of the model of computation which is implemented and in potential for attaining efficiency across a wide spectrum of parallel architectures through the use of class hierarchies as a means of mapping from logical to executable program representations.
