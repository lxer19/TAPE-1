Abstract: Cluster analysis with a novel stopping rule is used to decompose the arrival process into groups. The resulting clusters can be characterized using the time between clusters, the time between arrivals within clusters, and the size of each cluster. Each of these three components is then analyzed as a univariate problem.

Reference-contexts: occur in a replicated data system using optimistic concurrency control?" A number of systems have been built with this principle (see for example Bayou from Xerox PARC (Terry, Theimer, Pe-tersen, Demers, Spreitzer & Hauser 1995), Coda from CMU (Satyanarayanan, Kistler, Kumar, Okasaki, Siegel & Steere 1990) and Ficus from UCLA <ref> (Guy, Heidemann, Mak, Page, Popek & Rothmeier 1990) </ref>). However, due to differing architectures and environments, it has proved difficult to answer this question in a very general way using the actual systems. Hence, a flexible simulation was undertaken.

Reference-contexts: A second issue is how to compute distances between clusters. The statistical literature provides a large number of distance measures that are reasonable in various situations <ref> (Kaufman & Rousseeuw 1990) </ref>. We employ one of the oldest measures, known as single linkage or nearest neighbor: The distance between two clusters is the minimum distance between any member of one cluster and any member of the other.

Reference-contexts: Here n is the number of clusters and m = i=1 2. Modeling: Fit distributions to the observed inter-cluster times, intra-cluster times, and cluster-size data. Our software uses the Fittr1 package (Swain, Venkatraman & Wilson 1988) to determine the parameters of the Johnson translation system <ref> (Ord 1972, Johnson 1949) </ref> for each of the random variables. 3. Generation: Use the parameters selected by Fittr1 for random-variate generation of X, Y , and D. (Though D is discrete, we fit a continuous distribution and then round to the nearest integer to obtain the cluster size.) 4.
