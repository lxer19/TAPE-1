Title: A Critique of Yoav Shoham's Theory of Causal Reasoning  
Author: Antony Galton 
Address: Exeter EX4 4PT, U.K.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Exeter  
Abstract: Causal reasoning is an essential part of a number of tasks that have been central to many endeavours in AInotably planning and prediction, diagnosis and explanation. Recently it has become an object of study in its own right, drawing inspiration from the work of philosophers and logicians as well as more immediately AI-oriented concerns. In this paper I shall examine just one approach to causal reasoning, that advocated by Yoav Shoham in a recent book and article. In particular, I shall try to lay bare a number of assumptions underlying Shoham's work, all of which I shall call into question. Key assumptions are that causality is an epistemic notion, that causal reasoning is inherently non-monotonic, and that epistemic reasoning should be handled by means of modal logic. While arguing against these assumptions, I do not offer a specific causal theory of my own, but shall conclude with some suggestions as to the general lines which I feel such a theory ought to follow.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps a better example could be found in which the cause and the causal field conditions are all events, or all states. This needs further investigation. But it does show that one cannot be too careful about respecting distinctions of aspectual character, such as that between states and events <ref> (Galton 1984) </ref>which Shoham explicitly disavows when he says `I will not introduce a distinction among events, facts, processes, and so on, at the primitive level'. Of course, even if my criticism of Shoham is right, this does not mean that non-monotonicity is 6 necessarily absent from causal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: interesting attempt to draw a formal distinction between two different kinds of default rule involved in causal reasoning, which he calls causal and evidential (Pearl 1988), and Geffner's use of a `causal operator', C, which may be read, roughly, as `we have a causal explanation for : : : ' <ref> (Geffner 1990) </ref>. In this paper I shall not examine these approaches in detail, but shall focus my discussion on the approach to causal reasoning advocated by Yoav Shoham in a recent book and article (Shoham 1988, Shoham 1990). <p> It is worth comparing this formulation with Geffner's account using the causal operator C <ref> (Geffner 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Lifschitz's theory makes use of the Situation Calculus <ref> (McCarthy and Hayes 1969) </ref>, which does incorporate some aspectual distinctions lacking from Shoham's account, as embodied in the categories of action and fluent: only an action can be a cause, and only a fluent can be a precondition for action.

Reference-contexts: Shoham says : : : A causes B if, whenever one believes A, and one does not believe that the background assumptions C are false, then one believes B. <ref> (Shoham 1990, p. 225) </ref> As already remarked, this is much too psychological to suffice as a true account of causality; at the very least, we should replace `believes' by `has reason to believe'. But even then, the epistemic component would appear to be a superficial gloss.
