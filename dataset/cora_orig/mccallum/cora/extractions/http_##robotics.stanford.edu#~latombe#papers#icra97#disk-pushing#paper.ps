Title: Nonholonomic Path Planning for Pushing a Disk Among Obstacles  
Author: Pankaj K. Agarwal Jean-Claude Latombe Rajeev Motwani Prabhakar Raghavan 
Abstract: We consider the path-planning problem for a robot pushing an object in an environment containing obstacles. This new variant of the classical robot path-planning problem has several interesting geometric aspects, which we explore. We focus on the setting where the robot makes a point contact with the object which is assumed to be a unit disk, while the obstacles are assumed to be polygonal.
