Title: CO 598A: Computational Biology Bibliography  
Author: R. Ravi Andrew Yao 
Date: Spring 1995  
Abstract: This bibliography contains references to all the articles that were used as material for a graduate course at Princeton. The progression of the material tries to roughly follow the various steps in assembly and analysis of genetic information from small to big pieces. After a brief introduction to the various basic biological concepts, we described an alternative sequencing strategy (SBH). Then we turned to how how sequenced pieces are assembled into fragments, and subsequently these fragments into clones. Then we studied problems arising in the the process of putting these clones into a physical map using probes. At this point, we took a detour to study algorithms to search and analyze this information efficiently, by looking at methods for efficient comparison of two or more molecular sequences and their statistical significance. Then, we illustrated two applications of sequence data in Biology: building evolutionary trees and also investigating rearrangements of whole genomes. During the course of the semester, we also sampled the work of several guest speakers on physical mapping techniques, prediction of the tertiary structure of proteins from their sequence, prediction of genes from raw sequence data, perfect phylogeny, reconstructing evolutionary trees from distance data, and viral shell assembly models.
