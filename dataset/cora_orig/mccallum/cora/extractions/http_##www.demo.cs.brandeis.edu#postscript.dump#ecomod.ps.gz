Abstract: It has long been known that extinctions or wild oscillations in populations can occur when population density is too low, or when a population is confined to too small an area at high population density. This study discovers another cause of extinction. Cellular automata models of a single population in a landscape indicate that, if a population occupies an unconfined region smaller than a critical size, it can also become extinct in spite of healthy population density, the availability of suitable areas to migrate to, and the absence of competitors and predators.

Reference-contexts: All cells are updated synchronously. Cellular automata are also known as coupled map lattices (Sole & Valls, 1992). The best-known cellular automaton is John Conway's "Game of Life" <ref> (Berlekamp et al., 1982) </ref>, made famous by Martin Gard-ner's column in Scientific American (Gardner, 1970). In Life, each cell in the cartesian grid is in one of two states, alive or dead. <p> Suffice to say that in nearly all cellular automata (including the most famous example, Conway's Game of Life <ref> (Berlekamp et al., 1982) </ref>), the local dynamics alone don't offer simple predictions about the global dynamics.

Reference-contexts: However, as this is a deterministic cellular automaton with a finite number of states, any run will ultimately end in a fixed state or a finite limit cycle <ref> (Green, 1993) </ref>. This is because each cell can be in a finite number of states, and there are a finite number of cells, giving a finite number of combinations that the model can be in. <p> The characteristic features of such processes include sharp, systematic changes in behaviour and the three phases noted here | extinction, transition, and expansion. An important feature of such systems is that the transition zone tends to be chaotic <ref> (Green, 1993) </ref>. The occurrence of chaos in the present system may explain the variability in behaviour observed for many combinations of parameters that lie near the "phase changes". Variability of this kind would not otherwise occur in a deterministic system such as this model.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A crucial issue in conserving biodiversity is the relationship between the area occupied by a population and its chances of survival. Most studies that address this relationship limit themselves to populations that are strictly confined to a small area. However, both field studies <ref> (Krebs et al., 1969) </ref> and theoretical models (Crowley, 1981; Sole & Valls, 1992) suggest, in the words of Krebs et al (Krebs et al., 1969), "that dispersal is somehow necessary for normal population regulation" (Krebs et al., 1969, author's italics). <p> Most studies that address this relationship limit themselves to populations that are strictly confined to a small area. However, both field studies <ref> (Krebs et al., 1969) </ref> and theoretical models (Crowley, 1981; Sole & Valls, 1992) suggest, in the words of Krebs et al (Krebs et al., 1969), "that dispersal is somehow necessary for normal population regulation" (Krebs et al., 1969, author's italics). <p> This is a variation on the "fence effect", where a species (such as field mice <ref> (Krebs et al., 1969) </ref>) suffers a population collapse if it occupies an area which is too small.

Reference-contexts: too small an area, even if the species is: * surrounded by empty, habitable land and is free to expand; * without competitors or predators; * at a reasonable population density, with neither overcrowd ing nor sparseness. 1991; Sole & Valls, 1992), and with studies of biodiversity on isolated islands <ref> (May, 1981) </ref>, that greater area prevents extinction. However, those previous studies considered a population confined to a small area. Our study is unique in that a population is not confined, and is free to expand out of the small area it initially occupies.

Reference-contexts: to expand, is there any connection between the initial area that it occupies and its chances of survival? We consider this question for the simplest possible system, a single species in an obstacle-free landscape. 2 The Model 2.1 What Are Cellular Automata? As used in this paper, a cellular automaton <ref> (Wolfram, 1984) </ref> is a cartesian grid of identical cells each of which is in one of a finite number of states. At each time step, a cell's state is updated according to a function of the states of its neighbouring cells and 2 THE MODEL 3 itself. <p> der Meijden, 1979) that demonstrate that population density is often heterogeneous, with local extinctions and local booms. * Partial differential equations, when approximated numerically on a grid, consume more computer time than a corre sponding cellular automaton (Gerhardt et al., 1990). 2.3 Cellular Automata and Landscape Popu lations Cellular automata <ref> (Wolfram, 1984) </ref> model a wide variety of complex systems. In landscape ecology, we use them to represent a landscape as a cartesian grid in which each cell corresponds to an area of the land surface (Green, 1989; Green, 1990; Hassell et al., 2 THE MODEL 4 1991).
