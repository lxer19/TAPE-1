Title: Isotropic Clustering for Hierarchical Radiosity Implementation and Experiences

Affiliation: Computer Graphics Group, University of Erlangen  
Abstract: Although Hierarchical Radiosity was a big step forward for finite element computations in the context of global illumination, the algorithm can hardly cope with scenes of more than medium complexity. The reason is that Hierarchical Radiosity requires an initial linking step, comparing all pairs of initial objects in the scene. These initial objects are then hierarchically subdivided in order to accurately represent the light transport between them. Isotropic Clustering, as introduced by Sillion, in addition creates a hierarchy above the input objects. Thus, it allows for the interaction of complete clusters of objects and avoids the costly initial linking step. In this paper, we describe our implementation of the isotropic clustering algorithm and discuss some of the problems that we encountered. The complexity of the algorithm is examined and clustering strategies are compared.

Reference-contexts: The reason for the different computation times is obvious: in the initial linking phase in HR more than 4 million initial links have to be considered. Compared to initial linking the number of links produced in the following refinement phase can be neglected. In <ref> [1] </ref> a method is described to accelerate the initial linking step in HR by dropping initial links with very little energy and gathering the missing energy from the complete environment. This can be interpreted as using one global cluster and replacing low energy links by links to that cluster.

Reference-contexts: many rendering systems have more information about the scene than just a list of patches and can use this information to generate such a hierarchy, this clustering approach surely is an interesting alternative. 2.3 Refinement In our implementation an energy-based oracle is used to decide about the refinement of links <ref> [2] </ref>. A link is refined if the product BF A is greater than a user-selected error threshold, where B is the radiosity of the sender, F the form factor and A the area of the receiver.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this increases the complexity of the algorithm to O (n log n) [12], but in practice the additional effort can be neglected (see Section 3 below). 2 Implementation We implemented the Isotropic Clustering algorithm within the Vision rendering system <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the case of Isotropic Clustering, a cluster is represented as an isotropically scattering volume. Methods to compute global illumination solutions in the presence of such isotropic volumes are described in <ref> [4] </ref>. As in surface radiosity, the outgoing radiance of such a volume can be described by its radiosity value and it is sufficient to compute irra-diance, neglecting the directional distribution of incoming radiance.

Reference-contexts: Another interesting point is visibility computation. In both IC and HR the major computation time is used for visibility tests. Using clusters as "grey boxes" may be a solution to achieve significant performance gains <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although there has been significant progress in global illumination research, the Isotropic Clustering Method of Sillion <ref> [6] </ref> is the first algorithm that can deliver first coarse results even for rather complex scenes in short time and also computes more accurate solutions in reasonable times. In the remainder of this section, we describe this algorithm, beginning with a description of the underlying Hierarchical Radiosity algorithm. <p> This problem is handled by the Isotropic Clustering method described in the following section. 1.2 Isotropic Clustering The aim of Isotropic Clustering <ref> [7, 6] </ref> is to get rid of the complexity of initial linking.

Reference-contexts: This problem is handled by the Isotropic Clustering method described in the following section. 1.2 Isotropic Clustering The aim of Isotropic Clustering <ref> [7, 6] </ref> is to get rid of the complexity of initial linking. <p> Using this volume radiosity, form factors between volumes and patches and between volumes and volumes can be computed. A detailed derivation of these form factors can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. Using this approach, the complexity of the algorithm is O (n). However, due to the assumption of isotropic volumes, artifacts appear, when a cluster is illuminated from a preferred direction. <p> One is to build clusters using a uniform octree subdivision of the bounding box of the scene. Every patch is then put into the smallest cluster completely containing it <ref> [7] </ref>. To restrict the depth of the clustering, a maximum octree subdivision level is used. The impact of this maximum level on the computation time is examined in the following section. Another possibility is to exploit the hierarchical structure of the input model.

Reference-contexts: Every object contains a number of sub-objects. For a patch the sub-objects are the patches produced by subdivision, whereas the sub-objects of a cluster can be other clusters or patches. By providing the "equivalent area" for clusters <ref> [8] </ref>, the major part of the implementation does not have to differentiate between patches and clusters. 2.2 Clustering We implemented two methods to find a clustering hierarchy. One is to build clusters using a uniform octree subdivision of the bounding box of the scene.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this threshold is not scale invariant, i.e. if the geometry of the scene is scaled uniformly, the threshold value must be scaled accordingly to obtain the same solution. On the other hand, this oracle avoids potentially infinite subdivision near singularities <ref> [10] </ref>. For that reason a minimal area threshold is usually not necessary anymore. To handle partial visibility between objects, we use the same oracle as for links between totally visible objects but with a stricter error threshold * partial &lt; *.

Reference-contexts: At that moment the direction of illumination is still known and can be used to distribute the light to the child patches, depending on the cosine between the patch's normal and the direction of illumination. Unfortunately, this increases the complexity of the algorithm to O (n log n) <ref> [12] </ref>, but in practice the additional effort can be neglected (see Section 3 below). 2 Implementation We implemented the Isotropic Clustering algorithm within the Vision rendering system [3]. Vision is an object-oriented global illumination rendering system, developed at the Computer Graphics Group of the University of Erlangen [9, 11]. <p> To avoid these artifacts, a cluster can "push" irradiance from one link to its children immediately during gathering, when the direction of incidence is still known, instead of pushing the complete irradiance accumulated over all links. In the terminology of Smits et al. <ref> [12] </ref> this is equivalent to replace the cheaper fi-Links, which require constant time, by the more expensive, but also more accurate ff-Links, requiring time proportional to the size of the cluster. According to [12] the use of ff-links increases the complexity of the algorithm to O (n log n). <p> In the terminology of Smits et al. <ref> [12] </ref> this is equivalent to replace the cheaper fi-Links, which require constant time, by the more expensive, but also more accurate ff-Links, requiring time proportional to the size of the cluster.

To examine the influence of that theoretical raise in complexity, we computed the office scene with and without immediate pushing of irradiance.
