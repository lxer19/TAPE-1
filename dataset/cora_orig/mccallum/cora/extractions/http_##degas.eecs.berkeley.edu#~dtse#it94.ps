Abstract: The following problem arises in many applications involving classification, identification, and inference. There is a set of objects X, and a particular x 2 X is chosen (unknown to us). Based on information obtained about x in a sequential manner, we wish to decide whether x belongs to one class of objects A 0 or different class of objects A 1 . We study a general paradigm applicable to a broad range of problems of this type, which we refer to as problems of class identification or discernibility. We consider various types of information sequences, and various success criteria including discernibility in the limit, discernibility with a stopping criterion, uniform discernibility, and discernibility in Cesaro sense. We consider decision rules both with and without memory. Necessary and sufficient conditions for discernibility are provided for each case in terms of separability conditions on the sets A 0 and A 1 . We then show that for any sets A 0 and A 1 , various types of separability can be achieved by allowing failure on appropriate sets of small measure. Applications to problems in language identification, system identification, and discrete geometry are discussed. fl This work was partially done while S. Kulkarni was with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Center for Intelligent Control Systems, M.I.T.

Reference-contexts: This result is based on the Baire Category Theorem (see for example, [13]). Proposition 21 Let X be a complete metric space. If a set and its complement are both dense in X, then they cannot both be F . For example, suppose X = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The rationals and the irrationals are both dense in X and therefore they cannot be both F . (In fact, the irrationals are not F .) Hence one cannot discern between the rationals and irrationals, even when given information sequences with known rates. <p> In particular, if A 0 is F , then one can take A 0 0 = A 0 , and C is a subset of A 1 . 2 For example, it follows that although we cannot discern between the rationals and the irrationals in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, there is a discerning rule which fails on only a set of Lebesgue measure 0. Furthermore, since the rationals are F we can choose the failure set to contain only irrationals. <p> It would be interesting to characterize the set of convergent sequences in case, prove general discernibility results for these sequences, and obtain conditions for language identification. In the countable case with A i = fL i g these conditions would be equivalent to the condition obtained by Angluin <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The main results make this idea precise by providing necessary and sufficient separability conditions on A 0 and A 1 for various information sequences. Our motivation for this work comes from several directions. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Cover considered the problem of deciding whether the mean of an unknown random variable belongs to a countable set A or its complement given a sequence of i.i.d. observations. <p> Furthermore, it is not required that we know when convergence has been established.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we study a general paradigm which can be applied to a broad range of identification problems such as those mentioned above. We refer to problems of this type as class identification problems or discernibility problems (the term discernibil-ity is coined in <ref> [5] </ref>). The results obtained provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of decision procedures for such problems. To address the question of whether a successful decision procedure exists for these types of problems, we first need a precise notion of "success." We consider four distinct success criteria. <p> Namely, they considered the problem of deciding whether 3 the distribution itself (rather than just the mean) belongs to a certain class of distributions or its complement. A similar success criterion was used and sufficient conditions which allow a decision procedure were provided. Dembo and Peres <ref> [5] </ref> provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the general decision problem considered in [18]. As a tool for the statistical problem, Dembo and Peres considered a completely deterministic formulation in a general metric space setting. Their deterministic formulation and corresponding results serve as the basis for the present work. <p> As a tool for the statistical problem, Dembo and Peres considered a completely deterministic formulation in a general metric space setting.

A similar criterion has also been used for some time in the language identification literature [3, 6, 12], and more recently in system identification [16]. <p> This may serve as a model for noisy observations, where the noise is completely arbitrary but bounded so that even when there are more and more observations, there is some intrinsic inaccuracy that cannot be got rid of. Classes 1 and 3 were considered in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> The results of this section are summarized in Table 1. 3.1 Discernibility in the Limit Proposition 1 <ref> [5] </ref> A 0 and A 1 are discernible in the limit for all convergent sequences with known rate if and only if they can be covered by disjoint F sets. (F sets are those which are countable union of closed sets.) Since the covers are F , they can be decomposed <p> Hence, for all sufficiently large n we will make the correct decision that x 2 A 0 . A similar argument holds if x 2 A 1 . 2 If the convergent rates are not known at all, then we need stronger separation between the two sets. Proposition 3 <ref> [5] </ref> A 0 and A 1 are discernible in the limit for all convergent sequences if and only if they can be covered by disjoint open sets. <p> First, we state the following result <ref> [5] </ref> which shows that there are sets which cannot be completely discerned, even when given information sequences with known rates of convergence. This result is based on the Baire Category Theorem (see for example, [13]). Proposition 21 Let X be a complete metric space. <p> Then we can "almost" separate any two sets by disjoint F sets. Hence, we can discern in the limit any two sets except for a set of measure zero for all sequences with known rate (or even eventually known rates). (There are similar results in <ref> [5] </ref>.) 15 Proposition 22 Let A 0 and A 1 be any two disjoint Borel-measurable sets in X. Then there is a set C of P -measure 0 such that A 0 C and A 1 C are separated by disjoint F sets. <p> A natural extension to consider (as done in [4, 8, 11, 18]) is discernibility between a countable number of sets A 0 ; A 1 ; : : :.
