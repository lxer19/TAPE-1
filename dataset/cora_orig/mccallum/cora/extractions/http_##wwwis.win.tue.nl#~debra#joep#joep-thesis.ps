Title: Acknowledgements  
Abstract: First of all I would like to thank my advisors, dr. De Bra and dr. ir. Houben for the many stimulating discussions and for improving my English. Furthermore I am grateful to all people who participated in the experiments and especially to drs. Erica de Vries for her advise on how to conduct these experiments. I would also like to thank my housemates, Alexander van de Pas, ir. Jean Moonen and Rene de Leijer for their support. And last but certainly not least I would like to thank my parents for their love and encouragement.

Reference-contexts: The graph representing the structure of HHO contains 238 nodes and 687 links. (After deleting an index and a reference node. These nodes disturb the structure of the hypertext <ref> [1] </ref>.) 3. 3 structures generated by Erica de Vries [3] for experiments conducted with human users. * The first one (E0) has a network-like structure. This graph contains 57 nodes and 225 links; * the second one (E1) is strictly hierarchical. This graph contains 81 nodes and 80 links. <p> We distinguish three metrics, borrowed from <ref> [1] </ref>, that tell us something about the structure of a graph. The next section describes the way these metric values are calculated. 4.1 Calculating metric values The metrics we distinguish are: 1.

Reference-contexts: Our weight assignments just register the difference between the categories of users and hypertexts. We are certainly not suggesting that they represent all the different hypertext systems and user categories. See chapter 8. 3.2.1 Browsing time The results from the experiments conducted by Erica de Vries <ref> [2] </ref> with real users browsing through hypertexts, show us that depending on the goal given to the users, the average number of different nodes visited is: * about 45, if the users are asked to just browse around in the hypertext.

The way the information is presented to the user: Information containing pictures or other graphics probably lead to faster recognition than information that merely consists of text. It also depends on the layout and colors used <ref> [3] </ref>. 3. To what category of hypertexts it belongs. We will distinguish two categories: Category 1 hypertexts: This category contains hypertexts like HHO.

Reference-contexts: The third graph (graph 2) contains 100 nodes and 210 links. * The fourth graph (graph 3) contains 100 nodes and 188 links. * And the last randomly generated graph (graph 4) contains 100 nodes and 127 links. 2. * The HHO structure: This structure belongs to a commercial hypertext <ref> [4] </ref>.
