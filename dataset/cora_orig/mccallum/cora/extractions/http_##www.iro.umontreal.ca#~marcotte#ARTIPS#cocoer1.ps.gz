Title: CO-COERCIVITY AND ITS ROLE IN THE CONVERGENCE OF ITERATIVE SCHEMES FOR SOLVING VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES  
Author: D.L. Zhu and P. Marcotte 
Keyword: Mathematical programming. Variational inequalities. Monotonicity. Auxiliary problem. Co-coercivity.  
Date: January 1995  
Abstract: This paper stresses the role of co-coercivity and related notions in the convergence of iterative schemes for solving monotone, but not necessarily strongly or even strictly monotone variational inequalities. The analysis will be conducted within the conceptual framework of the "auxiliary problem principle".

Reference-contexts: particular, if we take h (y) = kyk 2 =2, the solution of the auxiliary variational inequality is given by the closed form expression y k+1 = maxf0; y k + *B (x k+1 )g (29) and our algorithm reduces to a Uzawa type method (see Bensoussan, Lions and Temam <ref> [2] </ref>). If F and rB are separable our primal-dual algorithm lends itself naturally to decomposition. Otherwise, decomposition can still be achieved by applying the auxiliary problem technique to the pair of variational inequalities (24)-(25).

The following lemma will be required in our analysis. <p> This result, together with the inequality fl (x k ) 2 allows us to conclude that the entire sequence fx k g converges to x. 2 Remark 1 The previous convergence result constitutes an extension of Cohen's result to the co-coercive case. Cohen <ref> [4] </ref> gave an example, involving a monotone mapping F , where the iterative method did not converge.

Reference-contexts: Throughout the paper, we assume that the mapping F is monotone over C and that the function f is convex over C. Various iterative schemes have been proposed for solving variational inequalities. The interested reader may consult the survey of Harker and Pang <ref> [6] </ref> for a good introduction to the subject. For several iterative methods, the convergence proof requires the mapping F to be strongly monotone over C. Recently, Tseng [11] and Marcotte and Wu [8] studied the convergence of iterative processes when the mapping F is affine and co-coercive. <p> Now let x (y) satisfy the variational inequality hF 1 (x (y); y); x x (y)i 0 8x 2 C x : (22) and let x = x (y). From our assumptions, the mapping x (y) is continuous in y (see Harker and Pang <ref> [6] </ref> for instance). Since y k 0 ! y, x k 0 +1 ! x and (x; y) satisfies (16) with (x fl ; y fl ) = (x; y). On the other hand, since ky k y k+1 k converges to zero, (x; y) satisfies (17).

Reference-contexts: In the affine case, the concept of co-coercivity can be related to that of psd-plus matrices. By definition, a matrix M is psd-plus if it is positive semidefinite, and M x = 0 whenever hM x; xi = 0. Recently, Luo and Tseng <ref> [7] </ref> have characterized the class of psd-plus matrices: a matrix M is psd-plus if and only if it can be decomposed into the product M = E t AE where A is a positive definite matrix.

Proof. Straightforward from the definitions. 2 As shown by Marcotte and Wu <ref> [8] </ref>, a sufficient condition for a mapping F to be co-coercive on a closed convex set C is that the Jacobian F 0 (x) and the square of the Jacobian F 0 (x) 2 be both positive semidefinite on C.
