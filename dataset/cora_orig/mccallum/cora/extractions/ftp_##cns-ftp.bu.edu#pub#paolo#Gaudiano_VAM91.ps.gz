Reference-contexts: VAMs have also been used to self-organize a body-centered representation of 3-D space that is capable of controlling a multi-joint arm to perform sequential planned actions at any realizable locations and size scales within the workspace, with or without a tool of variable length <ref> (Bullock, Greve, Grossberg, and Guen-ther, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Vector Integration to Endpoint (VITE) model of Bullock and Grossberg implements such a strategy of trajectory control and has been used to explain a large behavioral and neurobiological data base <ref> (see Bullock and Grossberg, 1988a, 1988b, 1989, 1990) </ref>. A prime example of an emergent invariant that is explained by the VITE model is the synchrony with which multiple joints can be moved at variable speeds. 3 The VITE Model circuit.

Reference-contexts: At the bottom of the figure, the Present Position Command (PPC) populations code an internal representation of where the arm presently is. Outflow movement commands to the arm are generated by the PPC. These outflow signals, supplemented by spinal circuitry and cerebellar learning <ref> (Bullock and Grossberg, 1989, 1990) </ref> move the hand to the location coded by the PPC relative to the body, 4 Command, DV = Difference Vector, PPC = Present Position Command.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, segregation of intermodal and intramodal target commands allows priming of target commands in spatial coordinates even during active AVITE babbling. The idea that learning of intramodal calibration parameters through motor babbling can take place prior to any form of visually-guided movements is supported by developmental data <ref> (e.g., Bushnell, 1985) </ref>. In fact, rhythmic endogenous movements have been monitored in the human fetus from as early as midgestation (Robertson, 1985).

Reference-contexts: In particular, many qualitative features of Selverston's own data about the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (Miller and Selverston, 1982a, 1982b; Selverston and Moulins, 1987) are strikingly similar to those of the oscillator that has been used to model circadian rhythms of the suprachiasmatic nuclei <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1983, 1984, 1985) </ref>. An important new role for modulators, or gates, in regulating adaptive behavior is described in this article.

Reference-contexts: As more and more arm positions are sampled through time, the transformation eventually enables the child to reach for objects that it sees. A similar kind of circular reaction is found in the "babbling phase" of speech acquisition in infants <ref> (Fry, 1966) </ref>. Here interactions take place between the speech perception (hearing) and production (speaking) systems. When the child babbles a sound, an auditory feedback representation of the sound is activated and coexists with the motor representation that gave rise to the sound.

Reference-contexts: The idea that learning of intramodal calibration parameters through motor babbling can take place prior to any form of visually-guided movements is supported by developmental data (e.g., Bushnell, 1985). In fact, rhythmic endogenous movements have been monitored in the human fetus from as early as midgestation <ref> (Robertson, 1985) </ref>. The ability to learn intramodal parameters before birth may be important for movements that do not require visual feedback for their calibration, and may be needed for infants of species that must be able to perform motor tasks from birth.
