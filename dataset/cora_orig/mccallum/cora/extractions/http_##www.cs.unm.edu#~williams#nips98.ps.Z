Abstract: A recent neural model of illusory contour formation is based on a distribution of natural shapes traced by particles moving with constant speed in directions given by Brownian motions. The input to that model consists of pairs of position and direction constraints and the output consists of the distribution of contours joining all such pairs. In general, these contours will not be closed and their distribution will not be scale-invariant. In this paper, we show how to compute a scale-invariant distribution of closed contours given position constraints alone and use this result to explain a well known illusory contour effect.

Reference-contexts: the above recurrence equation, we can define an expression for the relative number of contours of any length which begin and end at constraint i: c i = lim n!1 P (n) (i j i)= j P (n) (j j j) Using a result from the theory of positive matrices <ref> [1] </ref>, it is possible to show that the above expression is simply c i = s i s i = j s j s j where s and s are the right and left eigenvectors of P with largest positive real eigenvalue, i.e., s = Ps and s = P T

Reference-contexts: They argued that the mode, magnitude and variance of the completion field are related to the observed shape, salience, and sharpness of illusory contours. Unfortunately, the Williams and Jacobs model, as described, has some shortcomings. Recent psychophysics suggests that contour salience is greatly enhanced by closure <ref> [2] </ref>. Yet, in general, the distribution computed by the Williams and Jacobs model does not consist of closed contours. Nor is it scale-invariant|doubling the distances between the constraints does not produce a comparable completion field of double the size without a corresponding doubling of the particle's speeds.

The first distribution consists of weak but frequently acting impulses (we call this the Gaussian-limit).

First, we evaluated max (fl) over the velocity interval [1:1 1 ; 1:1 30 ] using standard numerical routines and plotted the magnitude of the largest, real positive eigenvalue, max vs. log 1:1 (1=fl). The function reaches its maximum value at fl max 1:1 20 . <p> The positions of the line endpoints is the same. the stochastic completion field changes as these parameters are varied. Observers report that as the width of the arms increases, the shape of the illusory contour changes from a circle to a square <ref> [4] </ref>. The endpoints of the lines comprising the Koffka Cross can be used to define a set of position and orientation constraints (Figure 3 (b)). The position constraints are specified in terms of the parameters, d and w.
