Abstract: The exponential growth of the Internet and increasing communication and computational power have created many opportunities for advancing engineering, manufacturing and business activities. Although rich in content, existing catalog systems are poor in both search quality and the usage of the retrieved information. The Active Catalog brings a conceptually new idea to electronic commerce by providing new, computationally usable, catalog information environment about products and their applications. It is designed for finding and using information in building applications in design, logistics, and electronic commerce in the context of heterogeneous, Internet-based distributed computing environments. This paper focuses on increasing the quality of search results and providing users with easy access to catalog information. We provide various ways of understanding user requirements and powerful reasoning capabilities, so that the catalog service can correctly capture the user goals and improve hit ratio and coverage of the results.

Reference-contexts: Also, Active Catalog provides more powerful mechanisms for information search and evaluation by providing various information access processes and simulations of many modalities, in addition to viewing texts and drawings. Mediator <ref> (Gaines, Norrie, & Lapsley 1995) </ref> is a knowledge support system for managing activities in manufacturing process. Although it provides KL-One like inference services and powerful graphical capabilities, Mediator focuses on accessing remote files and applications rather than on helping users to access, evaluate, and consume information in distributed task environments.

Reference-contexts: A number of other researchers are exploring knowledge-based design environments. In particular, SHADE system <ref> (McGuire et al. 1993) </ref> uses an ontology based approach to facilitate collaboration between product development and integrated manufacturing. SHADE is based on Ontolingua while Active Catalog will be based on Ontosaurus.

Reference-contexts: Declarative knowledge in Loom consists of definitions, rules, facts, and default rules. The semantic model of servo control system consists of a set of definitions, rules and facts, matching Loom's power. To support building domain ontology and incremental development of a shared ontology, Active Catalog is using On-tosaurus <ref> (Swartout et al. Nov 1996) </ref>, a web-based ontology editor for Loom. Searching for Catalog Information Increasing hit ratio The hit ratio of retrieved information can be defined as the proportion of the useful items among the retrieved items.
