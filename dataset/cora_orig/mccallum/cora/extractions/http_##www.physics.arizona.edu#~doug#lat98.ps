Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind quark actions containing repeatedly smeared links are studied to address the issue of flavor symmetry restoration. As a measure of the flavor symmetry restoration the mass spectrum of all the pions is computed. We present results for several variants of the "fat" actions that are suitable for full QCD simulations.

Reference-contexts: This is because smearing reduces the coupling to high transverse momentum glu-ons which cause transitions between the corners of the Brillouin zone. There are various smear-ings proposed so far. The simplest one, which has been studied by the MILC collaboration <ref> [1] </ref>, is the introduction of the 3-link staple to the coupling of the nearest neighbors. A more extensive smearing has been studied by Sinclair and Lagae [2], who have shown that flavor symmetry breaking is further reduced.

Finally, extensive APE smearing has been studied in SU (2) quenched spectroscopy [3], showing degeneracy within statistical errors between the Goldstone pion and the local non-Goldstone pion ( 2 ).

Our goal is to find an action that achieves small flavor symmetry breaking, yet is localized enough to allow for a relatively cheap force computation when used in dynamical simulations. <p> SIMULATIONS For our spectroscopy we used lattices with dynamical Kogut-Susskind quarks.

ACTIONS TESTED As a guide in the construction of actions with improved flavor symmetry breaking we require that the coupling of the quarks to high transverse momentum gluons is minimized.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, our data show that one has to look at the spectrum of all the sixteen pions before drawing any conclusions for the quality of the action. In particular, for studies of QCD thermodynamics with the strange quark <ref> [6] </ref>, one would like to have all the pions light compared to the kaons. Our results show that in order to do so, we have to go to lattice spacings significantly smaller [4] than those predicted from looking just at the local non-Goldstone pion.

Reference-contexts: The fourth is the 3-link fl 5 fl 0 (left) and the 2-link fl 0 fl 5 fl i (right). The 3 above degeneracies are predicted in the contribution <ref> [7] </ref> by Lee and Sharpe in this conference. From our data it can be seen that in general, smearing improves flavor symmetry breaking. Of the actions tested here, flavor symmetry breaking is smallest with the "Ape4" action, which is also the one with the most extensive smearing.
