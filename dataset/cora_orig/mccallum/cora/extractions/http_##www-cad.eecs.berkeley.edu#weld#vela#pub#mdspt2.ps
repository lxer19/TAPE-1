Reference-contexts: In general, they have limited fault tolerance, do not scale well, have poor availability due to lack of replication, do not address mobile computing needs and lack in adequate transaction models <ref> [AAA+97] </ref>. Crucial areas of work include fault tolerance, continuous availability, and replication [MAG+95]. 4.3.2 Components Our distributed workflow system for CAD has five main components that can be distributed and replicated as desired for fault tolerance. 8 The components are: 1.

Reference-contexts: These facilities were then grouped into those that supported process management and those that supported physical data management, including distributed data management on a network. This model was developed to fit the multitasking process/communication model of the UNIX operating system <ref> [BEL78] </ref>, and is still commonly used by EDA systems today. Specialized services, including user interfaces, design versioning and configuration management, and EDA data representation semantics, were stacked upon this layer.

Reference-contexts: In the past, much of the distributed tool flow and collaboration work was implemented under the X-Windows architecture or, more recently, using Tcl/Tk [OUS94]. Some specific points of interest include: The Design Agent system <ref> [BEN97] </ref>, which presents an information-centric paradigm for CAD systems and could make use of WELD Infrastructure. <p> Areas of interest include: Generic data models, such as the one under development at IBM for the Silicon Integration Initiative (SI2, formerly the CAD Framework Initiative, CFI) [SI297], and data-centric design <ref> [BEN97] </ref>. These are currently being evaluated. 34 Architecture and Infrastructure for a Distributed Design Environment A Server Perspective The use of distributed caches in a potentially unreliable network.

Reference-contexts: As described by Brewer <ref> [BF97, FGB+97] </ref>, proxies have the ability to: Support new features without having to add them directly into the servers, as a means to build services before economies of scale exist and add services that the servers are not interested in providing.

Reference-contexts: Originally seen as a means of mitigating client and network variation and as a means to cache data <ref> [BKK85] </ref>, proxies can be placed in varying locations (such as the client end, server end, or middle) in a network connection to offer variations in the ACID/BASE models [FGB+97].

Reference-contexts: Perform aggregation, characterization, measurement, and collaboration services over multiple sites. Offer increased flexibility (i.e. on where to place the service) and incremental scalability. Perform added functionality with low overhead the pass-through delay of a base proxy, written in PERL, is 3-6% <ref> [BMM+96] </ref>. Although the proxy architecture developed by this group is very extensive, it does not fully meet the requirements of CAD applications. Currently, the proxies work best when dealing with no or soft state, which is clearly not sufficient for CAD.

Reference-contexts: is made to present as many of the important technologies under development as possible, there are currently so many Web-related research projects underway that it is impossible to keep track of them all. 3.1 Computer-Aided Design In the early part of this decade, EDA systems were built upon framework models <ref> [HRS+90, WOL94, BRO92, NCS87, JOH92, SS90] </ref>, which were organized as shown in Figure 3 [HRS+90]. Operating system services were abstracted as supporting user interaction, process services, local storage, or network services.

Reference-contexts: Smaller-grained transactions and interactive tool sessions are of particular importance in CAD, where some tools generate 1500 or more files over the course of the tool's execution <ref> [CAS97] </ref>. If failure occurs in the middle of such an activity, it would be desirable to pick up at the failure point.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of commercial systems available that tackle specific aspects of the distributed workflow management task for EDA (e.g.[ARF90,91, ASP97, EDT97, RTD97, SYN97). At the present, many companies and universities are evaluating the possibilities of networks, Java <ref> [BEA97 BLU97, CCI+97, HAL96, JAV97_1,2, JAT97, MAR97] </ref>, and advanced object models [BEN95, NII95, ODM97]. 3.2 Proxies There has been significant work done on proxies at UC Berkeley by Professor Eric Brewers research group.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the SpecCharts Editor [LEU97] is primarily standalone, using the network only for file save and load, while the Project Management application <ref> [CHA97] </ref> depends upon the network for object structure and organization. <p> Since the WELD client infrastructure, including the Java client extensions, sample applications, and detailed information on object usage, is covered in detail elsewhere <ref> [CHA97, LEU97] </ref>, it will not be discussed here. 2.2.2 Server Infrastructure Servers in the WELD system are components found in the network that provide a variety of useful functionality, including data management, information retrieval, registration services, and workflow services that invoke tools remotely. <p> An object database was chosen because it was readily available and seemed to match the object nature of Java. The end result of this research phase became persistent Java object management package <ref> [CHA97] </ref> that was used to develop a web-based version of the Berkeley OCT Tools [OCT93], a web-based project manager [CHA97], and a web-based workflow system (see Section 4.3 below). 6 It should be noted that although security is also a primary concern for a distributed design system, our system is a <p> The end result of this research phase became persistent Java object management package <ref> [CHA97] </ref> that was used to develop a web-based version of the Berkeley OCT Tools [OCT93], a web-based project manager [CHA97], and a web-based workflow system (see Section 4.3 below). 6 It should be noted that although security is also a primary concern for a distributed design system, our system is a proof of concept prototype, and does not currently protect data from hostile or malicious attacks. <p> Operations are envisioned to occur over a wide area network (WAN), requiring a greater emphasis upon protocol efficiency and minimization of network transactions than in OCT, which was primarily local and used RPC <ref> [CHA97, FBG+96, OCT93] </ref>. 4.2.4 Conclusions and Future Directions Tool providers have realized the possibilities of combining database technology with the Web. <p> A relational database provides middle ground between the file system and the object database, offering many of the database capabilities of the object database, but still requiring additional modifications to add new data types and object hierarchies (see table in <ref> [CHA97] </ref>). Since the beginning of the project, object-relational databases [INF97_1] have become widely popular, and may offer improved tradeoffs. <p> The WELD project will continue in the effort to use emerging technologies, such as distributed computing infrastructure, for electronic system design. The prototyping efforts and infrastructure made to date include a data manager, a distributed workflow system, a server wrapper, and a Java client package <ref> [CHA97] </ref>, all built with scalability, flexibility, and extensibility in mind. Performance tests indicate that such a system, based upon Java front-ends in conjunction with native proxies and back-end servers found in the network, is indeed feasible, although there are still issues that need to be addressed.
