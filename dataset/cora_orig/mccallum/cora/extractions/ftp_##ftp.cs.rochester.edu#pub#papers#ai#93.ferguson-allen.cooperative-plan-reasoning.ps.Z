Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction For several years, we have been studying collaborative, dialogue-based interaction between humans and between humans and a computer system as part of the TRAINS project <ref> [Allen and Schubert, 1991] </ref>. The goal of the project is an intelligent planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language and that will assist a human manager (the user) formulate and execute plans.

Reference-contexts: This section describes the language and its use in representing action. Details are necessarily brief but references to more in-depth presentations are given. Interval temporal logic was initially developed for representing the content of natural language <ref> [Allen, 1983] </ref>. The twelve interval relations shown in Figure 2 correspond to several common locutions for temporally-qualified statements, and together with equality they can represent all possible relationships between two intervals.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of this sort is also essential for much of natural language semantics, where many verbs are defined and used without the agent's knowing the necessary causal knowledge. This is discussed at length in <ref> [Allen, 1984] </ref>. Event-based interval temporal logic is a powerful logic for representing and reasoning about action and change. In comparison to state-based approaches like the situation calculus, it can directly express the content of natural language utterances.

Reference-contexts: The search is breadth-first, thereby imposing a "shortest-path" heuristic|we prefer the simplest connection to the existing plan. Rather than dwell on the details, we will simply present each of the procedures together with a motivating example. More details are given in <ref> [Ferguson and Allen, 1993] </ref>. The procedure incorp-event takes as parameters a plan graph and an event (a term or a lambda expression representing an event type).

Reference-contexts: S: Shall I start loading the oranges into the empty car at Avon? M: Ok. A more elaborate dialogue of the sort motivating our current research is given in Appendix A, and others we have collected are available in annotated form in <ref> [Gross et al., 1993] </ref>. 3 Event-based Interval Temporal Logic The system's knowledge (world knowledge, planning knowledge, and knowledge of the discourse state) is represented using an expressive, temporally-explicit logic. This section describes the language and its use in representing action.

Reference-contexts: The system determines turntaking, grounding, and argumentation acts as well as core speech acts using Conversation Act Analysis [Traum and Hinkelman, 1992]. These speech acts, such as INFORM, SUGGEST, ASK-IF, etc., are represented using a language based on interval temporal logic <ref> [Heeman, 1993] </ref>. The dialogue manager prunes some speech act interpretations on the basis of its current knowledge. The dialogue manager maintains a hierarchy of belief contexts that represent the system's notion of the state of the discourse.

Reference-contexts: At the top, the input (currently typed, although we are working on prosodic features and speech input) is parsed by a GPSG-style parser to produce an indexical logical form in Episodic Logic <ref> [Hwang and Schubert, 1992] </ref>. This is processed by the scope and reference module to assign scope to tense and other operators and to resolve definite references [Poesio, 1993b; Poesio, 1993a].

Reference-contexts: Once a mutually agreed upon plan is constructed, it is dispatched for execution and monitoring by the TRAINS agents in a simulated TRAINS world <ref> [Martin, 1993] </ref>. The following simple dialogue is an example of a conversation that the implemented system handles. It was distilled from a transcript of a conversation between two humans. M: We have to make OJ. M: There are oranges at Avon and an OJ factory at Bath.

Reference-contexts: This is processed by the scope and reference module to assign scope to tense and other operators and to resolve definite references <ref> [Poesio, 1993b; Poesio, 1993a] </ref>. The resulting deindexed logical form is then given to the dialogue manager [Traum, 1993] which produces a set of possible interpretations of the utterance as speech acts.
