Abstract: Banach frames and atomic decompositions are sequences that have basis-like properties but which need not be bases. In particular, they allow elements of a Banach space to be written as linear combinations of the frame or atomic decomposition elements in a stable manner. In this paper we prove several functional-analytic properties of these decompositions, and show how these properties apply to Gabor and wavelet systems. We first prove that frames and atomic decompositions are stable under small perturbations. This is inspired by corresponding classical perturbation results for bases, including the Paley-Wiener basis stability criteria and the perturbation theorem of Kato. We introduce new and weaker conditions which ensure the desired stability. We then prove duality properties of atomic decompositions and consider some consequences for Hilbert frames. Finally, we demonstrate how our results apply in the practical case of Gabor systems in weighted L 2 spaces. Such systems can form atomic decompositions for L 2 w (IR), but cannot form Hilbert frames for L 2

The paper by Retherford and Holub <ref> [RH] </ref> is an excellent survey of perturbation results for bases. We introduce new and weaker conditions which ensure the desired stability. Next, we prove duality properties of atomic decompositions in Section 3, and consider some consequences for Hilbert frames in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: The operator (T K fl + KT fl + KK fl ) S 1 is compact, so the operator (T K fl + KT fl + KK fl ) S 1 + I has closed range (see Theorem 4.23 of <ref> [R] </ref>). Composing this with S, we see that V V fl also has closed range. Now consider V V fl as an operator on the closed subspace spanfw i g.

Reference-contexts: These are Banach spaces similar in many respects to Besov spaces, defined by smoothness and decay conditions. Walnut studied this construction in detail in <ref> [W] </ref>, extending and improving many results for the case of weighted L 2 spaces. In particular, he showed that Gabor atomic decompositions in L 2 w (IR) need not be Hilbert frames. <p> Gabor systems in L 2 (IR) are discussed in detail in [BHW], [D1], [D2], [HW]. Gabor systems in weighted L 2 spaces and in the more general setting of the modulation spaces are discussed in [BW], [F2], <ref> [W] </ref>. Gabor systems are very useful in analyzing the local frequency content of a function. Feichtinger and Walnut have shown that Gabor systems can be useful outside the setting of L 2 (IR). <p> Also, since w is moderate there must exist a constant C &gt; 0 such that sup w (t) C inf w (t) for every n; with C independent of n <ref> [W] </ref>. Since G is a-periodic, we therefore have sup w (t) C inf w (t) ff E+na BC : Hence w (t) BC=ff a.e., and similarly w (t) A=(Cfi) a.e. 2 Although Hilbert frames for L 2 w (IR) are not possible for nontrivial weights, Walnut [BW], [W], building on ideas <p> independent of n <ref> [W] </ref>. Since G is a-periodic, we therefore have sup w (t) C inf w (t) ff E+na BC : Hence w (t) BC=ff a.e., and similarly w (t) A=(Cfi) a.e. 2 Although Hilbert frames for L 2 w (IR) are not possible for nontrivial weights, Walnut [BW], [W], building on ideas of Feichtinger [F2], has shown that it is possible to construct Gabor atomic decompositions for L 2 w (IR) in much the same spirit as the classical results on Gabor frames for L 2 (IR). <p> Spaces of this type have been defined and studied by Feichtinger and Gr ochenig [F1], [FG1], [FG2] in great detail; they are Wiener amalgam spaces.

Reference-contexts: A frame which is a basis must be a Riesz basis. Conversely, all Riesz bases are frames. The basic theory of frames in Hilbert spaces can be found in Duffin and Schaeffer's original paper [DS], Young's classic text <ref> [Y] </ref>, Daubechies' paper [D1] and book [D2], or the research-tutorial [HW]. Frames were extended to Banach spaces by Gr ochenig [G]. In Hilbert spaces, the norm equivalence hypothesis leads immediately to the reconstruction formula (1.1). This does not hold in Banach spaces in general. <p> We begin in Section 2 by demonstrating that atomic decompositions and the related concept of Banach frames are stable under small perturbations. This is inspired by corresponding classical perturbation results for bases, e.g., the Paley-Wiener basis stability criteria [PW], <ref> [Y] </ref> and the perturbation theorem of Kato [K]. The paper by Retherford and Holub [RH] is an excellent survey of perturbation results for bases. We introduce new and weaker conditions which ensure the desired stability. <p> For atomic decompositions, we can perturb in X instead of X 0 . Our result is a "Paley-Wiener Theorem for atomic decompositions" (see p. 38 of <ref> [Y] </ref>). Theorem 2.3. Suppose that X d has an absolutely continuous norm. Let (fy i g; fx i g) be an atomic decomposition of X with respect to X d with bounds A, B. Let fw i g X.
