Reference-contexts: of cycles C k 1 , C k 2 , : : : , C k p in B n B j such that: C k 1 has edges in common with G j1 , C k q has edges in common with C k q+1 for all q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref>, and C k p has edges in common with C j . Then we can reorder the basis by exchanging C j and C k . A weaker result holds for non-fundamental cycle bases: Lemma 4. <p> Given such an embedding we will refer to the set of edges on the boundary to the exterior region as the boundary B of G. A graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a K 4 or K 3;2 minor <ref> [1] </ref>. An algebraic characterization in terms of a spectral invariant is discussed in [4]. Lemma 5. An outerplanar graph G (V; E) is Hamiltonian if and only if it is 2-connected. Proof. A Hamiltonian graph is always 2-connected.

Reference-contexts: The set C of all cycles forms a subspace of (E; ; ) which is called the cycle space of G. A basis B of the cycle space C is called a cycle basis of G (V; E) <ref> [2] </ref>. The dimension of the cycle space is the cyclomatic number or first Betti number -(G) = jEj jV j + 1.

Reference-contexts: The length `(B) of a cycle basis B is sum of the lengths of its cycles: `(B) = P C2B jCj. A minimal cycle basis is a cycle basis with minimal length. Let c (B) be the length of the longest cycle in the cycle basis B. Chickering <ref> [3] </ref> showed that if `(B) is minimal then c (B) is minimal, i.e., a minimal cycle basis has a shortest longest cycle. A cycle C is relevant [13] if it is contained in a minimal cycle basis. Vismara [15] proved the following Proposition 1.

Reference-contexts: A graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a K 4 or K 3;2 minor [1]. An algebraic characterization in terms of a spectral invariant is discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Lemma 5. An outerplanar graph G (V; E) is Hamiltonian if and only if it is 2-connected. Proof. A Hamiltonian graph is always 2-connected. Suppose G is outerplanar, 2-connected, but not Hamiltonian. 2-connectedness implies that there is no cut-vertex.

Reference-contexts: Upper Bounds on min `(B) In [10, theorem 6] an upper bound for the length of a minimal cycle basis M of an arbitrary graph G (V; E) is given: `(M) 3 (jV j 1)(jV j 2)=2: (4) While this bound is sharp for complete graphs <ref> [5] </ref>, it can be improved substantially for planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: The result on planar graphs is an immediate corollary of Euler's formula for polyhedra. The upper bound on outerplanar graphs follows from a theorem by G.A. Dirac <ref> [6] </ref> stating that for any graph not containing K 4 as a minor we have jEj 2jV j 3. A bamboo-shoot graph [19] consisting of n triangles has n 0 = n + 2 vertices and 2n + 1 = 2n 0 3 edges.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The description of cyclic structures is an important problem in graph theory (see e.g. [16]). Cycle bases of graphs have a variety of applications in science and engineering, among them in structural analysis [11] and in chemical structure storage and retrieval systems <ref> [7] </ref>. Naturally, minimal cycles bases are of particular practical interest. In this contribution we prove that outerplanar graphs have a unique minimal cycle basis. This result was motivated by the analysis of the structures of biopolymers.

Reference-contexts: Experimental energy parameters are available for the contribution of an individual loop as a function of its size, of the type of bonds that are contained in it, and on the monomers (nucleotides) that it is composed of <ref> [8] </ref>. Based on this energy model it is possible to compute the secondary structure with minimal energy given the sequence of nucleotides using a dynamic programming technique [17]. 2.

Reference-contexts: Hence a minimal cycle basis is chordless (and of course elementary). 3. Fundamental Cycle Bases In what follows let G (V; E) be a 2-connected graph. A collection of -(G) cycles in G is called fundamental if there exists an ordering of these cycles such that <ref> [9, 18] </ref> C j n (C 1 [ C 2 [ [ C j1 ) 6= ; for 2 j -(G) (1) Of course such a collection is a cycle basis. Not all cycle bases are fundamental [9]. Lemma 3. <p> Not all cycle bases are fundamental <ref> [9] </ref>. Lemma 3. An elementary fundamental cycle basis can be ordered such that (i) C 1 is an elementary cycle and (ii) C j n (C 1 [ [ C j1 ) = P j is a nonempty path for 2 j -(G). Proof. <p> If B is a non-fundamental cycle basis of G then there is subgraph G 0 with cycle basis B 0 B such that each edge of G 0 is contained in at least two cycles of B 0 <ref> [9, prop. 4.2] </ref>. Furthermore, the examples of non-fundamental bases in [9] are much longer than the minimal cycles bases. One might be tempted therefore to conjecture that every minimal cycle basis is fundamental. <p> If B is a non-fundamental cycle basis of G then there is subgraph G 0 with cycle basis B 0 B such that each edge of G 0 is contained in at least two cycles of B 0 [9, prop. 4.2]. Furthermore, the examples of non-fundamental bases in <ref> [9] </ref> are much longer than the minimal cycles bases. One might be tempted therefore to conjecture that every minimal cycle basis is fundamental. Although this statement is easily verified for planar graphs (see corollary 13), it is not true in general: Consider the complete graph K 9 with 9 vertices. <p> T . For details see [14]. It is obvious that a fundamental basis w.r.t. a spanning tree is a special case of the fundamental collections defined at the beginning of this section, see also <ref> [9] </ref>. The electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998), #R16 5 4. Outerplanar Graphs A graph G (V; E) is outer-planar if it can be embedded in the plane such that all vertices lie on the boundary of its exterior region. <p> The length of the outer boundary is at least g (G). As an immediate consequence we have Corollary 13. Every minimal cycle basis of a planar graph is fundamental. Proof. Suppose B is not fundamental. By <ref> [9, prop. 4.2] </ref> we can assume that here is a subset B 0 B such that (i) B 0 is a minimal cycle basis for G 0 , the subgraph of G induced by B 0 , and (ii) B 0 covers every edge of G 0 two or more times.

Upper Bounds on min `(B) In <ref> [10, theorem 6] </ref> an upper bound for the length of a minimal cycle basis M of an arbitrary graph G (V; E) is given: `(M) 3 (jV j 1)(jV j 2)=2: (4) While this bound is sharp for complete graphs [5], it can be improved substantially for planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: This basis is minimal, since every cycle has length 3. But it is non-fundamental, since every edge is covered at least two times. The concept of fundamental has originally been introduced by Kirchhoff in 1847 <ref> [12] </ref> in the following way: Suppose T is a spanning tree of G. Then for each edge ff =2 T there is unique cycle in T [ fffg which is called a fundamental cycle.

Reference-contexts: Let c (B) be the length of the longest cycle in the cycle basis B. Chickering [3] showed that if `(B) is minimal then c (B) is minimal, i.e., a minimal cycle basis has a shortest longest cycle.

A cycle C is relevant if and only if it cannot be represented as a -sum of shorter cycles. An immediate consequence is Corollary 2. A relevant cycle is chordless.

Preliminaries In this contribution we consider only finite simple graphs G (V; E) with vertex set V and edge set E, i.e., there are no loops or multiple edges. G (V; E) is 2-connected if the deletion of a single vertex does not disconnect the graph.

Reference-contexts: For each alpha in K we set Y ff = ffi 2 Kjfi ffg. Y fl denotes the set of -maximal elements in K, i.e., the set of contacts that are not interior to any other contact.

The upper bound on outerplanar graphs follows from a theorem by G.A. Dirac [6] stating that for any graph not containing K 4 as a minor we have jEj 2jV j 3. A bamboo-shoot graph <ref> [19] </ref> consisting of n triangles has n 0 = n + 2 vertices and 2n + 1 = 2n 0 3 edges.
