Title: User Recognition by Keystroke Latency Pattern Analysis  
Author: Dawn Song Peter Venable Adrian Perrig 
Date: April 30, 1998  
Abstract: We are analyzing keystroke latency patterns to identify the person typing on the keyboard. Unlike previous work in this domain, which focused on taking one reference sample and doing user authentication based on the reference sample only, we are continuously sampling user input and using the data for identification and also for further learning and refining our user model.

Reference-contexts: It can also be used as an additional biometric authentication method on a high security computer. 2 Previous work Joyce and Gupta have described an user authentication system by using keystroke in <ref> [JG90] </ref>. They are identifying a user by comparing the keystroke latencies of a fixed string, i.e. the password, with the previously stored samples. Our work differs substantially with Joyce and Gupta's approach because we do not rely on pre-selected strings such as passwords.
