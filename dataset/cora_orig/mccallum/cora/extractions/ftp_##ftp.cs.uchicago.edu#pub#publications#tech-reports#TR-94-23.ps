Reference-contexts: Given L 1 , Ge calculates L 2 using Lovasz's basis-reduction algorithm [LLL]. An alternative approach to finding L 2 for the case L 1 = Z k was found independently by G. Ostheimer [Os]. The lattice L 1 is calculated using a generalization of factor refinement (cf. <ref> [BDS] </ref>) to the case of ideals of algebraic integers. A difficulty with this is that algorithms for working with ideals usually require a Z-basis (see [Coh]). Merely finding a Z-basis for the ring of algebraic integers of F seems to require factoring the discriminant of F .

Reference-contexts: In fact, an algorithm of Hastad, Helfrich, Lagarias and Schnorr finds integer relations among real numbers [HHLS]. A difficulty with this approach is that the number of bits of precision required by the [HHLS] algorithm may be exponentially large (for recent estimates in this area, see <ref> [BW] </ref>). Ge avoids these difficulties by first calculating the lattice L 1 , and by proving that for logarithms of units, polynomial precision suffices. Given L 1 , Ge calculates L 2 using Lovasz's basis-reduction algorithm [LLL].

Reference-contexts: A solution (if one exists) can then be extracted via [Le2]. Our results imply that even for variable k, the commutative semigroup membership problem (existence of a solution) belongs to NP. Combined with <ref> [Be] </ref> this implies that the problem is NP-complete. We also consider two related problems. Suppose that S consists of invertible matrices, and we allow the x i to take on negative values. <p> A possible future extension of the present work would examine the complexity of membership in nilpotent or solvable groups; these cases are known to be decidable (Kopytov [Ko]). The commutative semigroup membership problem is known to be NP-hard (its special case of finite transformation semigroups is NP-complete, Beaudry <ref> [Be] </ref>). A non-trivial byproduct of our main results is that this problem belongs to NP and is therefore NP-complete (for variable k).

Reference-contexts: The case k = 2 (the "A-B-C problem"), formulated in [KL], was solved in <ref> [CLZ] </ref> (1994).

Here we wish to add that one of the sources of difficulty encountered by the algorithms in [CLZ] stems from its use of the Jordan Normal Form (JNF). The difficulties are of combinatorial as well as of algebraic nature. The underlying combinatorial structure can be held responsible for the impossibility of simultaneous JNF's of a pair of commuting matrices. <p> The underlying combinatorial structure can be held responsible for the impossibility of simultaneous JNF's of a pair of commuting matrices. The algebraic difficulties arise from the fact that the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial may have exponentially large degree. Indeed, <ref> [CLZ] </ref> relegates the details of JNF manipulation to another paper [C]. We avoid the use of JNF's and instead refer to the basic structure of matrix algebras. The key concept is the radical.

Reference-contexts: At first it may seem easy to find the lattice L 2 by taking the (complex) logarithms of the ff i and solving linear equations. In fact, an algorithm of Hastad, Helfrich, Lagarias and Schnorr finds integer relations among real numbers <ref> [HHLS] </ref>.

The case k = 2 (the "A-B-C problem"), formulated in [KL], was solved in [CLZ] (1994).

Reference-contexts: We represent the set of all solutions as the set of lattice points in the union of polyno-mially many convex cones. A solution (if one exists) can then be extracted via <ref> [Le2] </ref>. Our results imply that even for variable k, the commutative semigroup membership problem (existence of a solution) belongs to NP. Combined with [Be] this implies that the problem is NP-complete. We also consider two related problems. <p> For each y 2 Y , we solve the following system of linear diophantine inequalities in the variables x i : i 2 (I 1 [ I 3 ). * For all i 2 (I 1 [ I 3 ), x i 0. Note that by Lenstra's algorithm <ref> [Le2] </ref>, this step is in polynomial time if the dimension of L is fixed (which is certainly true if k is fixed, since L Z k ).

Given L 1 , Ge calculates L 2 using Lovasz's basis-reduction algorithm <ref> [LLL] </ref>. An alternative approach to finding L 2 for the case L 1 = Z k was found independently by G. Ostheimer [Os].

Reference-contexts: If his algorithm ever needs to divide by an ideal that is not invertible in O, then O is replaced by a strictly larger order. Note that as a consequence of Ge's results, the lattices L 1 and L 2 have bases with polynomially bounded bit length. Masser <ref> [Ma] </ref> gives tighter bounds on the bit lengths required to encode these lattices. 3.4 Unipotent elements and their logarithm The element u 2 A is unipotent if u 1 is nilpotent. In a commutative algebra, the set U of unipotent elements is a group under multiplication.

Reference-contexts: However, this problem is undecidable even for 3 fi 3 integral 2 matrices (Paterson [Pa]), and even the group membership problem is undecidable for 4 fi 4 integral matrices (Mihalova <ref> [Mi] </ref>). Therefore we restrict our attention to the commutative case, still quite challenging, as its history demonstrates.

Reference-contexts: We note that the most natural generalization of the "orbit problem" (membership in cyclic semigroups of matrices) would be the membership problem for matrix semigroups, given by a list of generators. However, this problem is undecidable even for 3 fi 3 integral 2 matrices (Paterson <ref> [Pa] </ref>), and even the group membership problem is undecidable for 4 fi 4 integral matrices (Mihalova [Mi]).
