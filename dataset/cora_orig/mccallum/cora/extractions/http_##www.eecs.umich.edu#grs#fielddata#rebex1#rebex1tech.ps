Reference-contexts: T SKY is the sum of T DN , the downwelling radiobrightness from the atmosphere, and cosmic radiation attenuated by the atmosphere. Calculation of T DN is based on solution of the equation of radiative transfer <ref> [1] </ref>: dB + B = J (12) where B is brightness (W/m 2 sr) and J is the effective total source function at a point r in direction ^r, dt is incremental optical depth defined as dt = e dr; (13) and e is the total extinction coefficient. <p> Also shown are the percentage of ^ T SKY values from (21) that were less than zero. vapor content. We used the semi-empirical formulations in <ref> [1] </ref> to calculate g and then integrated (16) numerically over the range of altitudes available in the Huron atmospheric profiles. Before integrating, we increased the vertical sampling density of the rawinsonde data by 20 times using cubic spline interpolation.
