Reference-contexts: There are several classes of implicitly defined graphical models that can accommodate a combination of discrete and continuous variables using Conditional-Gaussian distributions. Among these models, in addition to all of the models in the previous sections, are AMP chain graphs <ref> (Andersson, Madigan, and Perlman, 1996) </ref>, and reciprocal graphs (Koster, 1997). These graphical models all correspond to semi-algebraic sets because independence facts in CG-distributions are expressible as polynomial equalities. 11 4.3 Parametric representations In this section we discuss graphical models with hidden variables which are usually defined parametrically.

Reference-contexts: Note that if f is a polynomial map then f is a semi-algebraic map because its graph can be described by m polynomial equalities: y j f j (x) = 0, where 1 j m. A key result about semi-algebraic sets is given by the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem <ref> (see, e.g., Benedetti and Risler, 1990) </ref>. Theorem 5 (Tarski-Seidenberg) Let f : X ! Y be a semi-algebraic map. Then the image f (X) Y is a semi-algebraic set. Now we examine the connection between varieties and smooth manifolds. <p> A stratified set is a set that has a stratification. The dimension of a stratified set is d 1 | the largest dimension of a stratum. A key theorem about semi-algebraic sets is that each semi-algebraic set has a semi-algebraic stratification <ref> (Benedetti and Risler, 1990) </ref>. We note that if E is a stratified set and f is a diffeomorphism, then f (E) is also a stratified set. This proposition, that stratification is preserved under a diffeomorphism f , is proven as follows. Let fA i g be a stratification of A.

Reference-contexts: Asymptotic techniques are not needed for choosing between multinomial Bayesian networks because a closed-form formula for the marginal likelihood P (datajmodel) is known for these classes <ref> (Cooper and Herskovits, 1992) </ref>. Such a formula is not known for various Bayesian networks including those using noisy or-gates or causal independence models and so our classification of these graphical models as CEFs justifies using BIC for selecting models within these classes.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the work described in this and previous sections is part of an ongoing project with David Heckerman of identifying and extending results on asymptotic model selection for directed graphical models with and without hidden variables <ref> (e.g., Geiger et al., 1996) </ref>. In this section we review asymptotic model selection, place our results in this context, and discuss future work.

Reference-contexts: A question arises, then, whether BIC is valid as an asymptotic proce 19 dure for Stratified Exponential Families. The proof of its validity for CEFs in <ref> (Haughton, 1988) </ref> uses inherent properties of smooth manifolds and so this proof does not extend to SEFs. However, we believe, and are working with David Heckerman to show, that BIC is valid for stratified exponential families for various definitions of stratified sets.

Reference-contexts: Showing that some graphical models are CEFs provides access to the properties of these families which have been studied in the statistics community <ref> (e.g., Kass and Vos, 1997) </ref>. In particular, Haughton (1988) established, under some regularity assumptions, that BIC is a valid asymptotic rule for selecting models from a set of curved exponential families.

Reference-contexts: The relevance for model selection of both the procedure and the classification is examined. The properties of linear exponential families (LEFs) have been extensively studied in statistics. We begin by reviewing LEFs and demonstrating the well-known fact that undirected graphical models with no hidden variables are LEFs <ref> (e.g., Lauritzen, 1996) </ref>. This result provides access to the properties of these families. In particular, with respect to model selection, Schwarz (1978) established, under some regularity assumptions, that the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is a valid asymptotic rule for selecting models from a collection of linear exponential families. <p> This class is essentially the only class of distributions that has finite dimensional sufficient statistics. In this background section we give a definition of linear exponential families (LEFs) and discuss the well-known representation of undirected graphical models as LEFs <ref> (e.g., 2 Lauritzen, 1996) </ref>. 2.1 Definition of Linear Exponential Families A family (or model) is a set of probability density functions. <p> Dividing each equation by (w 0 ) 2 and taking the log, yields 8 linear equations in terms of the natural parameters i = log w i =w 0 . In general, multinomial graphical models are log-affine models which are LEFs <ref> (Lauritzen, 1996, pp 76) </ref>. A Gaussian undirected graphical model is a family of multivariate non singular Gaussian distributions in which some of the off-diagonal elements t ij 4 of the precision matrix (the inverse of the covariance matrix) are set to zero. <p> For details see <ref> (Lauritzen, 1996, pp. 124-132) </ref>. A Conditional Gaussian undirected graphical model is a family of Conditional Gaussian (CG) distributions over a set of discrete and continuous variables defined by a set of saturated independence constraints stating that variables i and j are conditionally independent given the remaining variables.

Reference-contexts: In general, to prove that a variety is not a manifold one must examine the particular defining polynomials. In addition, as our example suggests, if one removes all singular points from a variety, the remaining set is a union of smooth manifolds. This Theorem is due to Whitney <ref> (See, e.g., Milnor, 1968) </ref>. Another fact about semi-algebraic sets is that they admit a stratification. We will define this concept in Section 4.5 but the idea can be illustrated with the variety V (x 2 y 2 z 2 + z 3 ).

Reference-contexts: A Multinomial Bayesian network B (fi; n; m) is a Bayesian network where fi, n, m and B n;m are given as follows <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>. Let (x 1 ; : : : ; x k ) be an ordered sequence of discrete random variables each having a finite set of values. <p> These include decision tree and decision graph models (Friedman and Goldszmidt 1996; Chickering, Meek, and Heckerman, 1997), noisy-or gates, leaky noisy-or gates, max-gates and causal independence models <ref> (Pearl, 1988, Henrion, 1987, and Heckerman and Breese, 1996) </ref>. These models share the following characteristic. For each variable x i in the Bayesian network, a subset of k i states of p i are designated as reference states.

Reference-contexts: Since these constraints vary from one model to another they can be used to distinguish between models. For instance, when we applied implic-itization to a particular Gaussian Bayesian network we generated the well known tetrad difference constraints which have been used for model selection and evaluation by several researchers <ref> (see, e.g., Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines, 1993) </ref>. 2 Linear Exponential Families Exponential families of probability distributions play an important role in the study of statistics. This class is essentially the only class of distributions that has finite dimensional sufficient statistics. <p> Similarly, we note that Gaussian Bayesian network with hidden variables also correspond to semi-algebraic sets due to their parametric definition via a polynomial mapping called the trek-rule <ref> (see, e.g., Spirtes et al. 1993) </ref>. Consequently, the image of these graphical models can be described with a set of polynomial equalities and polynomial inequalities. 4.4 Implicitization As discussed in previous sections, the image of a parametric definition is a semi-algebraic set. <p> The results of implicitization on the mapping described above is a set of four constraints; two constraints for the independence between A and C given B and two constraints that we call the Verma constraints. The Verma 15 constraints are discussed in detail in <ref> (Spirtes et al., 1993) </ref>. <p> Bollen and Ting (1993) have used these and similar distribution free tests for evaluating the quality of hidden variable models. Spirtes has provided a graphical characterization and a method for calculating tetrad difference constraints from Gaussian Bayesian networks with hidden variables <ref> (see, Spirtes et al., 1993) </ref>. By calculating the set of tetrad difference constraints that are implied by each of a set of competing structures and using the Wishart significance test one can select models from the set of competing structures.

Reference-contexts: Another way to verify whether a subset of R n is a manifold is given by the following Theorem <ref> (e.g., Spivak, 1965) </ref>. Theorem 1 Let A R m be open and let h : A ! R mn be a smooth function such that h 0 (x) has rank m n whenever h (x) = 0. Then h 1 (0) is a n-dimensional manifold in R m .
