Abstract: We take the position that autonomous agents, when they interact with people, should be governed by the same principles that underlie human collaboration. These principles come from research in computational linguistics, specifically collaborative discourse theory, which describes how people communicate and coordinate their activities in the context of shared tasks. We have implemented a prototype toolkit, called Collagen, which embodies collaborative discourse principles, and used it to build a collaborative interface agent for a simple air travel application. The potential benefits of this approach include application-independence, naturalness of use, and ease of learning, without requiring natural language understanding by the agent.

Reference-contexts: Task Modelling In order to use Collagen, an agent developer must provide a formal model of the collaborative task (s) being performed by the agent and user. Defining this model is very similar to what is called "data modelling" in database or "domain modelling" in artificial intelligence <ref> (Brodie, Mylopoulos, & Schmidt 1982) </ref>. It also overlaps with modern specification practices in software engineering, although the goals and recipes in a task model for collaborative discourse include more abstract concepts than are usually formalized in current 4 software practice, except for in expert or knowledge--based systems.

Reference-contexts: The intepretation algorithm also takes care of deciding when to push a new segment on the stack or pop the current segment. It is tempting to think of discourse intepretation as plan recognition, which is known to be exponential in the worst case <ref> (Kautz 1990) </ref>. However, this misses a key property of normal human discourse, namely that the participants work hard to make sure that their partners understand their intentions without a large cognitive search.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Cohen (1992) and Jacob (1995), among others, have explored discourse-related extensions to direct manipulation interfaces that make previous context directly available. However, most work on applying human discourse principles to human-computer interaction, e.g., <ref> (Lambert & Carberry 1991, Yanklovich 1994) </ref>, has assumed that natural language understanding will be applied to the user's utterances. Terveen (1991) has explored providing intelligent assistance through collaborative graphical manipulation without explicitly invoking the agent paradigm.

Reference-contexts: Because this paper concentrates on Collagen, it will by necessity be sketchier on the prototype application. Whenever possible, general issues will be illustrated in the air travel domain; a short sample session is also presented at the end of this paper. Readers are referred to <ref> (Rich & Sidner 1996a, 1996b) </ref> for more details on the air travel application system. Collagen and the air travel application have both been implemented in Common Lisp. <p> The agent manipulates objects in the application window using the hand icon currently shown at rest in its home window. For additional details on some of the implementation issues related adding an interface agent to graphical user interfaces, see <ref> (Rich & Sidner 1996a) </ref>. Sample Session The user could just start working by herself on scheduling the San Francisco-Dallas-Boston trip above by directly manipulating objects in the application window. Instead, she chooses to communicate with the agent to initiate a collaboration.

Reference-contexts: The segmented interaction history also serves as a menu for history-based transformations, such as returning to earlier points in the collaboration or replaying earlier segments in a new context. See <ref> (Rich & Sidner 1996b) </ref> for more about history-based transformations. Inside the Agent The left side of Figure 2 shows the components of Collagen inside the agent. At the top of the figure, the discourse interpretation module receives selections from the user communication menu.

Reference-contexts: Architecture with the user. As commented earlier, the architecture at this level is applicable to all kinds of agents. In addition to the components shown in this figure, Collagen also includes a layer of special windowing facilities <ref> (Rich 1996) </ref> to support the interface agent paradigm (see later section). The first thing to notice about the architecture in 3 cution is a "black box." We are not trying to provide a toolkit for building a complete agent.
