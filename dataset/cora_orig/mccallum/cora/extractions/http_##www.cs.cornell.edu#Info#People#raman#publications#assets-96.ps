Title: Emacspeak -Direct Speech Access work directly on a UNIX system (Until now, the only option
Author: T. V. Raman 
Web: ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/digital/emacspeak/ WWW http://www.research.digital.com/CRL  
Note: Emacspeak is the first full-fledged speech output system that will allow someone who cannot see to  I currently use Emacspeak at work on my SUN SparcStation and have also used it on a DECAL-PHA workstation under Digital UNIX while at Digital's CRL 1 I also use Emacspeak as the only  Emacspeak is available on the Internet: FTP

Commercial packages for Microsoft Windows 3.1 provide varying levels of spoken access to the GUI. The Mercator project <ref> [ME92, WKES94, MW94, Myn94] </ref> has focused on providing spoken access to the X-Windows system. As is clear from the above, screen-readers for the UNIX environment have been conspicuous in their absence 2 . Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides complete speech access under UNIX.
