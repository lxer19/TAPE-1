Title: An Approximation Algorithm for the Number of Zeros of Arbitrary Polynomials over GF[q]  
Author: Dima Grigoriev Marek Karpinski 
Date: April, 1991  
Pubnum: TR-91-027  
Abstract: We design the first polynomial time (for an arbitrary and fixed field GF[q]) (*; ffi)-approximation algorithm for the number of zeros of arbitrary polynomial f(x 1 ; : : :; x n ) over GF [q]. It gives the first efficient method for estimating the number of zeros and nonzeros of multivariate polynomials over small finite fields other than GF [2] (like GF [3]), the case important for various circuit approximation techniques. The algorithm is based on the estimation of the number of zeros of an arbitrary polynomial f (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) over GF [q] in the function on the number m of its terms. The bounding ratio number is proved to be m (q1)log q which is the main technical contribution of this paper and could be of independent algebraic interest.

Reference-contexts: Take for example the polynomial (q 2)x 1 x n1 + x q1 j G f j (q1) n tends to infinity with growing n and does not satisfy the inequality q q1 . The bounds proven in Theorems 3, and 4 are almost optimal (cf. <ref> [GK 90] </ref>). 5 Open Problem Our method yields the first polynomial time (*; ffi)-approximation algorithm for the number of zeros of arbitrary polynomials f 2 GF [q][x 1 ; : : : ; x n ] for the fixed field 12 GF [q].

Reference-contexts: note that the condition whether f = 0 is satisfiable can be checked deterministically for arbitrary polynomial f 2 GF [q][x 1 ; : : : ; x n ] within the bounds stated above because of the following (for a problem of a black-box interpolation of f , see <ref> [GKS 90] </ref>): Proposition 1. Let f 2 GF [q][x 1 ; ; x n ] and c 2 GF [q], the equation f = c is satisfiable if and only if g = (f c) q1 1 has at least one nonconstant term.
