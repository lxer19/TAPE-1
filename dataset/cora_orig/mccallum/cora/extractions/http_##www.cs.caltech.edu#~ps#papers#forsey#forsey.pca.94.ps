Title: Langwidere: A New Facial Animation System

Abstract: This paper presents Langwidere, a facial animation system. Langwidere is the basis for a flexible system capable of imitating a wide range of characteristics and actions, such as speech or expressing emotion. Langwidere integrates a hierarchical spline modeling system with simulated muscles based on local area surface deformation. The multi-level shape representation allows control over the extent of deformations, at the same time reducing the number of control vertices needed to define the surface. The head model is constructed from a single closed surface allowing the modeling of internal structures such as tongue and teeth, rather than just a mask. Simulated muscles are attached to various levels of the surface with more rudimentary levels substituting for bone such as the skull and jaw. The combination of a hierarchical model and simulated muscles provides precise, flexible surface control and supports easy generation of new characters with a minimum of recoding.

Reference-contexts: These two major components of Langwidere are discussed in this section. 2.1. Hierarchical Splines A spline is a loosely defined term referring to curve and surface representations defined with piece-wise polynomial functions <ref> [2] </ref>. A spline is defined by a set of points, called control vertices and a set of basis functions, that determine the shape of the curve or surface. There are numerous spline formulations, but in this paper we deal only with bicubic B-splines.

Reference-contexts: facial features. 1 Note that most people have little trouble understandingthe extremely simple facial expression of cartoon figures Facial gestures have been simulated in polygonal and spline based surface representations by moving specific vertices or control points defining the skin using precise displacements in imitation of particular expressions or gestures <ref> [14, 15, 6] </ref>. This can produce the desired results, but new expressions will require a revision of all the involved degrees of freedom. <p> Also, actuating a polygonal model requires explicit, direct control of spe-cific facial vertices. Such direct control, while exhibiting certain favorable qualities, is restricting in terms of flexibility and creating generalized manipulation approaches. <ref> [6, p. 130] </ref>. Parke's model has parameters for the shape and size of the head. A different routine is used for each moveble part of the face.

When the shape of this underlying structure changes, such as when the jaw opens (see <ref> [9] </ref> for details of this mechanism) the attachment points also move and any previously defined muscle groups continue to work in a reasonable way. 2.3.3.

Reference-contexts: In later works, Waters suggests simply recalculating the area of influence for each active muscle and accumulating displacements without any regard for interaction. Users of this system report that this approach produces usable results for the major facial muscles (of which there are 16 in total) <ref> [12] </ref>. If we were simulating muscle action on a surface point using forces, the magnitude and direction of a combined force would be found simply by summing the participating forces. In Langwidere the magnitude and direction of the combined influence of several muscles is calculated separately.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if the muscle are pulling in opposite directions with equal magnitude, the resulting displacements should cancel out. 2.3.4. Normalizing the Muscle Pull Parameter. A fully contracted muscle can shorten to 75% of its original rest length <ref> [17, pp. 22-23] </ref>. When the muscle shortens, its volume remains constant, so its cross-section thickens as its length decreases. The effect of the muscle on the surface of the skin is to pull the surface from the area of the insertion point towards the attachment point.

Reference-contexts: This can produce the desired results, but new expressions will require a revision of all the involved degrees of freedom. A more general method of activation is to procedurally simulate the effects of individual muscles on skin <ref> [1, 16, 19, 21, 23] </ref>, this allows expressions to be described (almost) independently of surface geometry. <p> New parameters for manipulating and controlling the face model are constantly being generated. FAS is based on Parke's polygonal model 2 and have the same limitations. Keith Waters' muscle model process is one of the first systems to use simulated muscle activation <ref> [23] </ref>. The muscles are defined by a point of attachment, assumed to be fixed to bone, and a point of insertion, attached to skin. The simulated muscles deform the polygonal skin model by moving the vertices in a manner that mimics the effects of contraction on the skin. <p> In Waters' PhD. thesis, muscles interact by adding the displacement contributed by each muscle at each surface point. Because all movements are simply displacements there is a danger of displacing surface points to impossible degrees, and Waters recommends preprocessing the structure to ensure that this does not occur <ref> [23] </ref>. In later works, Waters suggests simply recalculating the area of influence for each active muscle and accumulating displacements without any regard for interaction. Users of this system report that this approach produces usable results for the major facial muscles (of which there are 16 in total) [12].

Reference-contexts: Waters has also experimented with spline patches and comments: for the modelling of the face patches have two advantages over direct polygonal descriptions: firstly the resolution can be selected for the structure, and secondly doubly curved surfaces can be generated. <ref> [24, page 230] </ref> Waite's Facial Action Control Editor (face) used a 13 9 mesh of bicubic B-spline patches, and four Action Units composed of twenty-six muscles (thirteen pairs of symmetric muscles).
