Reference-contexts: If k 7, then G is k-irreducible if and only if it is bicritical. Finally it turns out that Theorem 1.2 ([5]) A snark is irreducible if and only if it is bicritical. In <ref> [1] </ref> it is shown that there are cocritical snarks which are not critical, and that there are snarks which are neither critical nor cocritical. Further each critical snark on less than 30 vertices is bicritical and henceforth it is irreducible. Nedela and Skoviera [5] state the following problem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A snark is a bridgeless cubic graph with chromatic index 0 = 4. The study of the reduction of snarks is as old as the study of these graphs in itself.

Let G = (V (G); E (G)) be a snark and let F E (G) be a k-edge cut (k 0) whose removal divides G into two components H 1 and H 2 . <p> In [1] it is shown that there are cocritical snarks which are not critical, and that there are snarks which are neither critical nor cocritical. Further each critical snark on less than 30 vertices is bicritical and henceforth it is irreducible. Nedela and Skoviera <ref> [5] </ref> state the following problem. Problem 1.3 ([5]) Does there exist a snark that is critical but not bicritical? Equivalently, does there exist a 6-irreducible snark that is not irreducible? The answer is "yes".

Reference-contexts: In [10] the second author constructed infinite families of cyclically 4-edge connected critical snarks which are not bicritical. The smallest one has 32 vertices. M. Skoviera <ref> [7] </ref> also found another infinite family of cyclically 4-edge connected snarks with these properties by using a different method. In this note we improve these results in two directions.
