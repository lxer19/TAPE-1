Title: ON THE OPTIMAL BISECTION OF A POLYGON polygon is convex, or if the parts are

Abstract: We show that bisecting a polygon into two equal (possibly disconnected) parts with the smallest possible total perimeter is NP-complete, and it is in fact NP-hard to approximate within any ratio. In contrast, we give a dynamic programming algorithm which finds a subdivision into two parts with total perimeter at most that of the optimum bisection, such that the two parts have areas within * of each other; the time is polynomial in the number of sides of the polygon, and 1

Reference-contexts: By the well-known isoperimetric problem (see, for example, <ref> [BZ] </ref>), both curves must be circular arcs, say of curvature 1 and r 2 , repectively.

Reference-contexts: Our interest in this problem grew out of a related graph-theoretic problem, the bisection width of solid grid graphs [PSi]. The geometric problem has been looked at in the past, and has been recently studied intensely in the context of generalized planar separation theorems, see for example <ref> [LM] </ref>. The consensus seems to be that any such region (even a weighted one) can be bisected with total "knife action" (also appropriately weighted) proportional to the square root to its total weight. There are some very interesting results and open problems in this area.

The method used to prove Theorem 4 is dynamic programming. Unfortunately, the polynomial is O ( n 5 * 2 ). <p> A POLYNOMIAL ALGORITHM FOR *-BISECTION Our algorithm can be thought of as the geometric generalization of the well-known dynamic programming approximation algorithm for the PARTITION problem <ref> [PSt] </ref>. We assume, without loss of generality, that the polygon has unit area. Let ffi &gt; 0 be a small parameter to be fixed later, and let N = d 1 ffi e.
