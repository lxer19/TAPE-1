Reference-contexts: In real life application, a good solution is needed when no feasible solution is available. 2. Constraints are categorized into two types: hard constraints and relaxable constraints. Using mathematical programming will generate a non-linear programming problem <ref> [Chow 1993] </ref>. We report here a case study on applying constraint satisfaction techniques to solve a real world resource allocation problem, called Railway Track Possession Assignment Problem, using constraint programming language CHIP [Hentenryck 1989].

Reference-contexts: Constraint Handling Model Constraint programming language CHIP is used to model the problem. We shall not repeat the principle of CHIP here. Please refer to the literature for details <ref> [Dincbas 1988] </ref>. 4.1 Job Assignment For any job request Req (i), a set of seven domain variables D (i,1), D (i,2), . . . , D (i,7) are defined. Their domains are zero and one, i.e., the values for the variables are either 0 or 1.

Reference-contexts: Using mathematical programming will generate a non-linear programming problem [Chow 1993]. We report here a case study on applying constraint satisfaction techniques to solve a real world resource allocation problem, called Railway Track Possession Assignment Problem, using constraint programming language CHIP <ref> [Hentenryck 1989] </ref>. The problem is to assign railway tracks to a given set of scheduled maintenance tasks according to a set of constraints. We shall first describe the problem then followed by the problem solving model.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Resource allocation is the problem of allocating a set of resources to accomplish some tasks. Many real world problems are resource allocation problems, such as production planning and manpower planning. The problem has been studied extensively in the literature <ref> [Ibaraki 1988] </ref>. Techniques that have been used include mathematical programming and heuristic approach. Using mathematical programming, the resource allocation is formulated as an integer programming. Integer programming is proved to be a NP-complete problem [Papadimitriou 1982], which is often not possible to be solved efficiently.

Reference-contexts: For example, human experience on the particular problem domain is applied to find a solution that is close to a manually generated solution. This approach is employed by the knowledge-based system or - 3 - expert system to incorporate the human expertise into the computer system <ref> [Liu 1993] </ref>. The common techniques used by knowledge-based system for the resource allocation problem are forward chaining and constraint relaxation. Using knowledge-based system approach, the following characteristics of the real world problem can be handled, which are not easy to be represented by mathematical programming approach: 1.
