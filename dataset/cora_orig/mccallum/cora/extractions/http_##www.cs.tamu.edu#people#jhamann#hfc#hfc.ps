Reference-contexts: Cable television now passes 97% of U.S. households and is a major video service provider, with 63% of 2 all U.S. TV households receiving it <ref> [1] </ref>. Cable television historically operated through the technology of coaxial cable, implemented in a "tree and branch" architecture. Signals from broadcast transmissions and satellites are received or generated at the cable facility's headend, which serves as the point of origination for the distribution of signal to subscribers via coaxial cable. <p> Trunk cables carry the signal to feeder cables that reach into neighborhoods. Lastly, drop cables are extended from the feeder cables to carry the transmission into the subscriber's home and television set <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.3 HFC Solves Existing Problems The Hybrid Fiber-Coax Network is an emerging cable architecture for providing residential video, voice telephony, data, and other interactive services to subscribers' homes over fiber optic and coaxial cables. <p> It later began offering specialty channels, via satellite feeds, and now the installed cable network passes 97% of U.S. households <ref> [1] </ref>. As customers demand more bandwidth for interactive multimedia applications, the cable operators view HFC network technology as a means to satisfy existing customers while attracting new customers away from the local telephone companies.

Reference-contexts: An HFC network can provide the bandwidth that some multimedia applications require, using the spectrum from 5 MHz to 450 MHz for conventional downstream analog information, and the spectrum from 450 MHz to 750 MHz for digital broadcast services such as voice and video telephony, video-on-demand, and interactive television <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 2 HFC The basic fiber-coax network is already taking shape, driven by the video entertainment delivery business [3]. <p> For analog distribution, the headend includes transmission equipment such as frequency modulators and combiners, and for digital distribution, high speed ATM switches. A SONET ring connects the switches in the headend to distribution centers and to the rest of the access network <ref> [2] </ref>. Distribution centers are responsible for routing information from the headend to the subscribers' homes. Multiple services (voice telephony, digital video, and data services) are delivered to subscribers' homes by employing different modulation schemes and FDM techniques. <p> Distribution centers also controls the spectrum allocation, or the allocation for frequency bands for different services for the neighborhood it serves. Since HFC is a point-to-multipoint transmission network, the subscriber may request encryption to protect sensitive data. The distribution 6 center controls and manages encryption services <ref> [2] </ref>. Fiber nodes serving clusters of 500 to 2000 homes receive their signal feed from regional distribution centers. <p> The coaxial lines carry the signal a short distance to the subscriber, with amplifiers at appropriate places to prevent attenuation <ref> [2] </ref>. At the subscribers' homes, a variety of devices may be used to access information transmitted over the HFC network (see Figure 2). Voice telephony, video access, and data services are a few of the services that can be extracted from the network interface unit [2]. 2.3 Spectrum Allocation assumes a <p> appropriate places to prevent attenuation <ref> [2] </ref>. At the subscribers' homes, a variety of devices may be used to access information transmitted over the HFC network (see Figure 2). Voice telephony, video access, and data services are a few of the services that can be extracted from the network interface unit [2]. 2.3 Spectrum Allocation assumes a total bandwidth of 750 MHz is available on all of the coaxial cable links in the network. <p> The spectrum range of 5 MHz to 450 MHz can be used to carry conventional cable TV programming, while the spectrum between 450 MHz to 750 MHz can carry digital broadcast services, such as voice and video telephony, video-on-demand, interactive television, and ATM data <ref> [2] </ref>. 7 8 The downstream path, using modulation schemes like VSB-16 and QPSK, can transmit 30 to 40 Mbps, while the upstream path, using the spectrum from 5 MHz to 45 MHz, can transmit 2 to 10 Mbps using QPSK and Discrete Wavelet Multitone (DWMT). <p> The upstream path uses reverse channels that are shared among subscribers served by a distribution center, and can suffer greater noise when sending analog signals, due to multiple sources sending noise with signal <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.4 Upgrading to HFC With the basic units in place (information providers, headend office, SONET ring to distribution centers, and neighborhood fiber nodes), there are still key areas of focus for further study and discussion [3]: * Powering systems for network powering of critical user devices and protection powering of

Reference-contexts: to 450 MHz for conventional downstream analog information, and the spectrum from 450 MHz to 750 MHz for digital broadcast services such as voice and video telephony, video-on-demand, and interactive television [2]. 3 2 HFC The basic fiber-coax network is already taking shape, driven by the video entertainment delivery business <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Now, a 550 MHz signal carrying 80 channels is sent via fiber optics to a "node," where the signal is converted back into an electrical RF signal and distributed to the home. There are fewer amplifiers in the network to impair picture quality <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 2.2 An HFC Network Architecture A typical HFC network is shown in Figure 1. The network headend serves as a central location for services offered over the HFC network. <p> greater noise when sending analog signals, due to multiple sources sending noise with signal [2]. 2.4 Upgrading to HFC With the basic units in place (information providers, headend office, SONET ring to distribution centers, and neighborhood fiber nodes), there are still key areas of focus for further study and discussion <ref> [3] </ref>: * Powering systems for network powering of critical user devices and protection powering of the network itself. * Spectrum management systems, particularly for the limited return path. * Element management systems that contribute to a larger, common platform network management system. <p> The "lifeline" service idea also applies to the neighborhood fiber nodes, which may serve hundreds of customers, and will not tolerate extended outages due to loss of power <ref> [3] </ref>. The network management issues, both spectrum management and HFC network element management, are interrelated. <p> As HFC networks are integrated into SONET and other public network elements, cable operators will require an open, cost effective network management system <ref> [3] </ref>. 10 2.5 HFC Network Reliability GTE Laboratories evaluated HFC reliability for CATV, telephony/data and switched video services earlier this year. Their hypothetical HFC network included headend equipment connected to a fiber node via six miles of fiber. <p> The probability for long term success for the HFC access network is great. So is the probability for highly visible short term problems and corrections. Cable companies that are committed to the long term success of HFC technology will work through the various issues and make HFC a success <ref> [3] </ref>. 14

Reference-contexts: While some companies view HFC as a means to simply expand the offering of cable channels available to consumers, other HFC visionaries are designing switched digital video (SDV) networks, which will offer a superior level of interactivity and flexibility <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.1 HFC Today Since higher frequencies attenuate faster than lower frequencies, adding more channels to the traditional all-coaxial cable network means adding more coax amplifiers. Noise and distortion is added logarithmically, and picture quality deteriorates along the amplifier cascade. In addition, each amplifier introduces another point of common failure.

Reference-contexts: The typical span between headend and subscribers in the coaxial section contains no more than 0.4 miles of coaxial cable, no more than two radio frequency amplifiers beyond the fiber node, no more than three passive splitters, and no more than four taps <ref> [5] </ref>. Kwang Koai explained in Telephony that there has been wide-ranging, incomplete and in some cases conflicting and confusing CATV reliability data reported by individual equipment manufacturers, cable operators, and consulting firms. <p> organized into four categories: generic (generic Annualized Failure Rate/generic Mean Time to Repair), efficient service (generic Annualized Failure Rate/low Mean Time to Repair), improved technology (low Annualized Failure Rate/generic Mean Time to Repair), and optimistic (low Annualized Failure Rate/low Mean Time to Repair)<ref> [5] </ref>. 11 The results of GTE's tests were [5]: * Under the generic category, unavailability was approximately 270 minutes per year for telephony/data service. <p> The reliability of modern HFC networks currently being rolled out are expected to be remarkably better in view of improvements in installation 12 practices, maintenance procedures, and network monitoring. The optimistic category results can be seen as achievable goals for new HFC networks <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 Competition from the Telephone Operators The telephone companies, including the RBOC's (Regional Bell Operating Companies) and GTE, are also developing ways to bring bandwidth-intensive applications to their customers.
