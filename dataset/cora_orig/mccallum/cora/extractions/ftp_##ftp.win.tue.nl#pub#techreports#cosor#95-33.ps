Abstract: The paper deals with the open-shop problems with unit-time operations and nondecreasing symmetric objective functions depending on job completion times. We construct two schedules, one of them is optimal for any symmetric convex function, the other is optimal for any symmetric concave function. Each of these two schedules is given by an analytically defined function which assigns to each operation the number of a unit-time slot for its processing.

Reference-contexts: Observe that function P C i is convex and concave simultaneously, and hence, both schedules, s fl 2 , are optimal for this objective function. It should be mentioned here that optimal schedule for the problem Ojp ik = 1j P C i was constructed earlier in <ref> [1, 4, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Each job J i ; 1 i n; can be processed by any machine M k ; 1 k m; which requires time p i . The objective is to construct a schedule which minimizes function F . To denote scheduling problems, we follow classification scheme ffjfijfl <ref> [3] </ref>, where ff describes the machine environment, fi stands for the job characteristics, and fl is the objective function. In the case of the open-shop problem we have ff = O, and in the case of the parallel machine problem ff = P .

Reference-contexts: It should be mentioned that the result of Section 3 is substantially based on the result from <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> To prove the optimality of schedule s fl 2 , we show that schedule s fl 2 defines by (7) is optimal for the problem P jp i = m, P mtnj _ F . As it was proved in <ref> [5] </ref>, for the problem P jP mtnj _ there exists an optimal schedule without preemption. <p> Note that due to <ref> [5] </ref> the schedule s fl 2 is optimal for any e-quasiconcave nondecreasing objective function even if this function is not symmetric. 9 The definition of convex function is given in Section 1. We remind now the definitions of quasiconvex and e-quasiconvex functions.
