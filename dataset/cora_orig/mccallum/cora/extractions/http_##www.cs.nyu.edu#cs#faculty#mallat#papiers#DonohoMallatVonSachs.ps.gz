Abstract: In this paper we extend this approach to estimating the covariance from sampled data. Our method combines both wavelet shrinkage and cosine-packet best-basis selection in a simple and natural way. The resulting algorithm is fast and automatic. The method has an interpretation as a nonlinear, adaptive form of anisotropic time-frequency smoothing. We introduce a new class of locally stationary processes which exhibits a form of inhomogeneous nonstationarity; our processes have covariances which typically change little from row to row, but might occasionally change abruptly. We study performance in an asymptotic setting involving triangular arrays of processes which are becoming increasingly stationary, and are able to prove rates of convergence results for our estimator. For this class of processes, the algorithm has advantages over traditional approaches like fixed-window-length segmentation followed by autocovariance estimation. Key Words and Phrases.

Reference-contexts: use the periodogram and spectral estimates is to exploit the properties of this diagonalizing basis. 2 Developing this line of thought, [MPZ98] shows that for a process which is locally stationary in a certain sense, there is an orthonormal basis B within the Cosine Packet system of Coifman and Meyer <ref> [CM91] </ref> which "almost diagonalizes" . Suppose then that we knew this basis. We could attempt to replicate the successes in the stationary case, with the periodogram and with spectral estimation, by formally mimicking the linear algebraic structure of the approaches that were successful there. <p> Optimization of an arbitrary objective E over all orthogonal bases is not a problem with good algorithmic solutions. In the late 1980's, Coifman and Meyer <ref> [CM91] </ref> developed two finite libraries of orthogonal bases the cosine packets library and the wavelet packets library each of these libraries contains a very large but finite number of orthogonal bases; more will be said below. Wickerhauser [Wic91] suggested applying these libraries in problems related to covari-ance estimation. <p> We do not go here into important details, such as the role smooth folding projections <ref> [CM91, Wic94] </ref> in the construction of local cosine packets. Nor 11 do we discuss useful variations, such as smooth local complex exponentials ([Wic94], Section 4). We recognize that variations such as usmooth windowing are useful, e.g. to reduce leakage due to strong peaks in the spectrum. <p> Coifman and Meyer <ref> [CM91] </ref> see also the article by Coifman, Meyer, Quake, and Wickerhauser [CMQW94] (actually this has been available on the internet since early 1990) introduced the library of Wavelet Packet bases, a collection of orthonormal bases of R T which has a tree structure exactly paralleling the structure we have seen for

Reference-contexts: The two variables are a renormalized time (exactly as in Section 8) and a frequency; hence G may be viewed as a function on a normalized time-frequency domain. (A particular example of this can be found in the work of Dahlhaus <ref> [Dah97] </ref> on "evolutionary spectra" of "locally stationary processes". In this work renormalized time was introduced for the first time to define a class of non-stationary processes via a triangular array of synthesizing spectral representations which are coupled to a smooth and asymptotically unique time-evolutive spectrum. <p> Is there a way to reformulate wavelet smoothing of pseudo-Wigner Ville distributions to give it the interpretation of (implicitly?) constructing a basis? 17 Measuring Local Stationarity Many interesting approaches have been developed for defining local stationarity, going back to Priestley [Pri65] and extending to very recent efforts of Dahlhaus <ref> [Dah97] </ref> (compare our comment in Section 15), of Kozek [Koz96] (see below), and of Mallat, Papanicolaou, and Zhang [MPZ98].

Reference-contexts: This at first surprising fact follows from well-known results connecting rational approximation and wavelet approximation <ref> [Pet88, DJP90] </ref>. Au-toregressive models have rational transfer functions, and so their ability to approximate a stationary covariance is intimately connected with the sparsity of the wavelet transform of the corresponding spectrum.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that there are several results in related settings indicating that, as long as we allow the risk to be as much as a logarithmic factor worse than the ideal risk, one can dispense with an oracle. Compare <ref> [DJ94a] </ref>. This pattern holds here as well. In the next section we give a fully empirical method, and in the following section we give a theoretical analysis of its performance.

Reference-contexts: Such a viewpoint is fruitful because the ` p measure of sparsity exerts some analytic leverage. In this paper, we have seen that it allows one to control the risk of estimators.

It is also known that it measures the complexity of objects in terms of the description length (number of bits) [Don96].

In this paper we have introduced a different definition of local stationarity, specially tailored to allow us to efficiently expose the phenomenon of time-inhomogeneity, and the ability of time-then-frequency partitioning to adapt to such inhomogeneity. <p> The measure should work well for processes which are not homogeneously stationary, i.e. which on a small subset of their domain are changing rapidly. * Analytically Powerful. The measure should have direct implications for many derived quantities about which one would like to have information. W. Kozek <ref> [Koz96] </ref> has introduced an approach to measuring local stationarity which comes close to satisfying these requirements. Kozek introduced the notion of spread a dimensionless number which, if close to zero, implies near-stationarity.

Reference-contexts: know that from n = 1 realizations, we can obtain in this way a consistent estimate of the spectrum, and hence of : ` n;T ! 0 as max (n; T ) ! 1. 1.2 Locally Stationary Processes An abstract point of view, developed by Mallat, Papanicolaou and Zhang, in <ref> [MPZ98] </ref>, suggests that it should be possible to extend the success of covariance estimation from stationary processes to other settings. <p> And what we are doing when we use the periodogram and spectral estimates is to exploit the properties of this diagonalizing basis. 2 Developing this line of thought, <ref> [MPZ98] </ref> shows that for a process which is locally stationary in a certain sense, there is an orthonormal basis B within the Cosine Packet system of Coifman and Meyer [CM91] which "almost diagonalizes" . Suppose then that we knew this basis. <p> This point of view is supported by general assertions about the almost-diagonalization of covariances using cosine-packet libraries, and by experiments showing procedures operating successfully on simulated data. 1.3 Speculation versus Rigor The material described in <ref> [MPZ98] </ref> exemplifies the intellectual goals, patterns of argumentation and tools of thought in the field of Computational Harmonic Analysis (CHA), a rapidly developing field at the interface of mathematical analysis, signal processing, and computational algorithmics. <p> While most of the focus of this field is not on statistical problems, some of the important applications are directly statistical, for example in noise removal and in nonparametric classification. <ref> [MPZ98] </ref> approaches the problem of nonstationary time series analysis, which is statistical and fundamental, with heuristic principles originating in the fields of pseudo-differential operators, quantization of phase space in mathematical physics, and time-frequency analysis. <p> Often the methods of current interest in AOS are methods that were first proposed in some crude form decades ago, and after considerable efforts by many researchers are now being understood in a rigorous, asymptotic, uniform, or universal sense. However, <ref> [MPZ98] </ref> exactly does not do any of the research which usually goes to make up an AOS paper there is no concern with "tinkering" with parameters to make for provably good performance, but only with general structural features that estimates ought 3 to have. <p> For them, this carries with it certain problems, not the least being the temptation it provides to mathematicians to also abandon rigor, and the ensuing erosion of the reliability of the mathematical literature that this could cause. Speculative work like <ref> [MPZ98] </ref> poses analogous challenges to mathematical statistics. However, the presumably negative attitude of AOS readers towards such speculative research bears careful examination. On the one hand, there is currently an explosion of interest in the signal processing world in developing schemes for processing empirical data. <p> Almost all of this work is speculative in the sense we use the term here; one typically sees interesting ideas which are said to lead to practical procedures, but without any careful specification of a method or close performance analysis. <ref> [MPZ98] </ref> may therefore be taken as a convenient representative of a major phenomenon. We believe that mathematical statisticians might contribute usefully to a variety of areas of modern intellectual life and to mathematical statistics by carefully investigating the content of such speculative work. <p> We believe that mathematical statisticians might contribute usefully to a variety of areas of modern intellectual life and to mathematical statistics by carefully investigating the content of such speculative work.

Suppose that e (t) is strictly convex. Then the solution of the restricted optimization problem (2.3) is a basis which diagonalizes . Mallat, Papanicolaou, and Zhang <ref> [MPZ98] </ref>, working more or less independently of the Watanabe and Wickerhauser line of reasoning, developed a proposal which can be put in that form. In their proposal one uses the specific choice e 2 (t) = t 2 ; they performed several encouraging computational experiments with this choice. <p> The shrinkage has effects not just on reconstruction, but also on basis selection as well.

Note however, that our sample statistics derive not from empirical variances but rather from specially wavelet-smoothed variances. <p> of (implicitly?) constructing a basis? 17 Measuring Local Stationarity Many interesting approaches have been developed for defining local stationarity, going back to Priestley [Pri65] and extending to very recent efforts of Dahlhaus [Dah97] (compare our comment in Section 15), of Kozek [Koz96] (see below), and of Mallat, Papanicolaou, and Zhang <ref> [MPZ98] </ref>. In this paper we have introduced a different definition of local stationarity, specially tailored to allow us to efficiently expose the phenomenon of time-inhomogeneity, and the ability of time-then-frequency partitioning to adapt to such inhomogeneity.

Reference-contexts: The Best-Basis Covariance Estimation approach, while innovative and interesting, can nevertheless be made comparable with certain other approaches. In section 16 we describe partial connections with an approach by Neumann and von Sachs <ref> [NvS97] </ref> about the tensor-product wavelet smoothing of time-frequency distributions. Understanding the connection between finding a good basis and smoothing the time-frequency distribution gives a fourth open problem. <p> A new approach becomes available, one that simply expands the empirical symbol ~ G (u; ~) in an orthogonal tensor basis and applies hard thresholding. In an oversimplified treatment this could go as follows (compare Neumann and von Sachs <ref> [NvS97] </ref> for an accurate account). Let ( I (t)) and ( ~ I (k)) be wavelet ortho-bases for R T , where the first basis uses boundary correction, and the second basis is periodized.

Reference-contexts: This at first surprising fact follows from well-known results connecting rational approximation and wavelet approximation <ref> [Pet88, DJP90] </ref>. Au-toregressive models have rational transfer functions, and so their ability to approximate a stationary covariance is intimately connected with the sparsity of the wavelet transform of the corresponding spectrum.

Reference-contexts: Is there a way to reformulate wavelet smoothing of pseudo-Wigner Ville distributions to give it the interpretation of (implicitly?) constructing a basis? 17 Measuring Local Stationarity Many interesting approaches have been developed for defining local stationarity, going back to Priestley <ref> [Pri65] </ref> and extending to very recent efforts of Dahlhaus [Dah97] (compare our comment in Section 15), of Kozek [Koz96] (see below), and of Mallat, Papanicolaou, and Zhang [MPZ98].

Reference-contexts: speculative and rigorous is analogous to a classification in mathematics developed at length in a recent article by Arthur Jaffe and Frank Quinn in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society [JQ93]. (See also the extensive ensuing discussion in the April 1994 issue of the Bulletin, and the related article <ref> [Thu94] </ref>.) Jaffe and Quinn point out that recently a number of interesting interactions between mathematical physicists and mathematicians involve a meeting of two cultures - the culture of theoretical physics, which might be called a culture of brilliant speculations, and the culture of mathematics: the culture of rigorous proof.

Reference-contexts: However, such a gross overestimate will not work well in practice, since it will lead to a serious overshrinkage, and consequent eroding of structure in the time-frequency diagram. Against this background, we recall some experience in the stationary time series setting. Wahba <ref> [Wah80] </ref> showed that if one is interested in estimating the log-spectrum, then automatic smoothing of the log-periodogram is a simple and effective approach.

Reference-contexts: In the late 1980's, Coifman and Meyer [CM91] developed two finite libraries of orthogonal bases the cosine packets library and the wavelet packets library each of these libraries contains a very large but finite number of orthogonal bases; more will be said below. Wickerhauser <ref> [Wic91] </ref> suggested applying these libraries in problems related to covari-ance estimation. He proposed the notion of selecting a `best basis' for representing a covariance by optimization of an "entropy functional " E (B) over all bases in a restricted library L.

Reference-contexts: We need some notation for ideas which are standard in the cosine packet industry <ref> [Wic94] </ref>. 3.1 Partitions and Trees Let T = 2 t be a dyadic signal length, and let I = I j;k denote a dyadic subinterval, an interval of the form k T =2 j t &lt; (k + 1) T =2 j for 0 k &lt; 2 j . <p> We do not go here into important details, such as the role smooth folding projections <ref> [CM91, Wic94] </ref> in the construction of local cosine packets. Nor 11 do we discuss useful variations, such as smooth local complex exponentials ([Wic94], Section 4). We recognize that variations such as usmooth windowing are useful, e.g. to reduce leakage due to strong peaks in the spectrum.
