Abstract: In this paper we present the design and implementation of a novel protocol solution for distributing high quality compressed video streams to multiple receivers across a network. Our end-to-end protocol uses the connection-oriented multicast facility in the next-generation transport, the Xpress Transfer Protocol (XTP). XTP multicast provides in-order, multipoint delivery of packet streams with user-selectable options for enabling control algorithms and managing dynamic group membership in the multicast connection. XTP multicast gives the application flexibility in determining the robustness of the communication while insulating the application from managing multipoint delivery. In our design the multicast video application coding need only handle buffering for end-to-end synchronization. We have implemented our approach and provide performance measurements of this video distribution system in an FDDI network. We evaluate the performance of our system under different compression ratios when delivering a 640-by-480 8-bit color video stream at 30 frames/sec to four receivers.

Reference-contexts: The sensitivity of the video stream to lost packets depends on the encoding used. Proposed mechanisms for the recovery of packet loss in delay-sensitive streams include forward error correction <ref> [1, 6] </ref>, channel coding [5], or retransmission [3]. Synchronization of the video source with its multiple receivers is needed in order to ensure continuous playback of the video frames at the receiving endsystems.

Reference-contexts: XTP multicast uses the IP multicast addressing scheme and expects multi-point packet delivery in the underlying network. When running over an IEEE 802 local area network, the IP multicast address is mapped onto a multicast IEEE 802 MAC address, as specified in RFC 1112 <ref> [2] </ref>. The IEEE 802 LAN standards support multicast addressing, and network interface hardware commonly supports filtering on several addresses simultaneously. On the FDDI network described in Section 3, for instance, the network interface boards can filter on ten multicast addresses at the same time.

Reference-contexts: However, our experience with the algorithm is that the timeout value is difficult to tune correctly, and the lack of a notion of group membership results in reliability semantics that are not applicable to many applications. Experience with the bucket algorithm prompted work on a list-based XTP multicast facility <ref> [4] </ref>. In this multicast configuration, the transmitter maintains a table of all active receivers and the control information from all receivers is processed for every connection state update.

Reference-contexts: Having implemented the protocol, we analyze its performance in an FDDI network. The protocol solution we study is based primarily on the connection-oriented transport layer multicast available with the next-generation transport the Xpress Transfer Protocol (XTP) <ref> [7] </ref>. XTP multicast provides in-order, multipoint delivery of packets with error control options such as retransmission-based recovery of lost packets, rate control for the prevention of packet loss, and dynamic group membership in the connection.
