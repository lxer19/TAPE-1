Title: Responding to Users' Informational Needs in Time-Critical Situations  
Author: Abigail S. Gertner

Abstract: This paper argues that effectively communicating information to users who are involved in time-critical activities requires specialized capabilities for evaluating situations, filtering out the appropriate information, and producing easily accessible output. Simply displaying advice under such circumstances is unlikely to have a significant impact since it requires having the user's full attention on the system. An alternative is to reduce the amount of information presented by the system by adapting the output to the user's intended plan. This can be done by evaluating and critiquing the user's proposed actions in such a way that a critique is only given if there is a significant discrepancy between the user's intentions and the system's recommendations. This paper presents an approach to critiquing proposed actions during an ongoing process of planning and execution under critical time constraints. The problems addressed by this work include inferring the user's underlying intentions, deriving communicative goals based on the system's knowledge of the situation, realizing those communicative goals in natural language, and conveying them to the user.

Reference-contexts: Plan Recognition The function of the plan recognition component is to infer the underlying goal structure motivating the physician's orders for actions to be performed. Plan recognition in this domain is complicated by a number of factors. First, this is a case of keyhole recognition rather than intended recognition <ref> (Kautz 1990) </ref>. The physician does not intend to provide enough information to allow the system to infer his plans. Rather, the system must infer the plan incrementally based on what has been ordered so far, and there may be very little coherence in the order in which actions are mentioned.

Reference-contexts: Information that is relevant but is not considered critical to the outcome of the task is not included in the output of the system. We have adopted a critiquing approach to decision support <ref> (Miller 1986) </ref>, in which the output of the system is in the form of a critique based on the user's intended actions.

Reference-contexts: A second monitor placed within view of the trauma team will be used to present information from the system. In the future, critiques may be conveyed using synthesized speech <ref> (Prevost & Steedman 1993) </ref>. TraumAID's knowledge of plans and actions in its domain is represented in terms of management goals, procedures, and actions. Each goal is associated with a disjunctive list of procedures that may be used to address it.
