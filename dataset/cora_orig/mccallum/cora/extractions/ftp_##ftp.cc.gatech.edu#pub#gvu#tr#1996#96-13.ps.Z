Abstract: This paper describes a 4D object hierarchy that is appropriate for the immense amount of time-dependent, 3D data associated with large scale simulations or information spaces. An organizational hierarchy approach is developed that can also handle elements not contained in the organization. Using this flexible approach, even complex scenarios with constantly moving, changing objects can be displayed and explored in real-time with minimal clutter. The user may also move objects around by direct manipulation, define paths, create or delete hierarchical elements, and make other interactions. To strengthen the capacity for distributed simulations and for using sensor information from multiple sources, DIS capability has been integrated with this approach for dynamic updates of position, direction and speed, and hierarchical structure. The paper will discuss how the techniques used here can be applied to widely different organizational structures. If we can make use of all 4 dimensions available to us for our visualizations, and then navigate them in real-time, we have the potential to explore and understand the structure and content of even vast information spaces. This idea is applicable for datasets that have strong 3D spatial structure (so-called "landscape" data) but also for datasets that are large and multivariate, even without spatial structure. This latter are sometimes called "Information Landscapes". [1] The payoff here is in applying visual processing capability and high interactivity to exploratory visualization and analysis. Although there has been work on 3D visualization of information spaces, including the use of organizational structures to establish hierarchies, less attention has been paid to how these structures can be employed to retain real-time behavior and reduce clutter, even for large collections of 3D objects. Robertson et. al. [2] made an important step in showing the effectiveness of 3D visualization with their work on cone trees. The cone tree is a 3D tree that moves and transforms to bring into focus nodes (with the surrounding tree region) that a user touches. Using the high interactivity and 3D structure that the method affords, cone trees have been applied to the visualization of large organizations, numbering 20,000 or more nodes. Recently, the Narcissus system [3] has been used to organize collections of objects based on semantic relationships and a set of repulsive and attractive forces. The interplay of forces result in a more visually organized structure, even when large numbers of objects are involved. Some other approaches also use the File System Navigator from SGI [4]. There is also need for 4D hierarchical visualization techniques in "constant information flow" situations, where the amount of information received can be large and varied. This is the case in modern military systems, among other applications, where sensing, networking, and information processing have been brought together. Information storage, computing, and networking technologies will be combined to form a "common picture of the battlefield" [5]-a picture shared by all ranks from infantrymen to overall commanders. The common picture of the battlefield will produce immense amounts of data associated with tactical goals and options, dynamic operations, unit and troop movement, and general battlefield information. A widely held objective is to display, update, and interact with these data in real-time using 3D
