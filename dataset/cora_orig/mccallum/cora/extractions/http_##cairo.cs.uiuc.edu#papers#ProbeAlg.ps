Abstract: Multimedia services such as Video-On-Demand (VOD) will require a certain level of Quality of Services (QoS). However, the VOD service will be required to run on general purpose machines such as PCs or workstations and shared networks such as Ethernet and ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) LANs due to the prohibitive cost of home networking. In this environment one problem is the specification of application QoS [7] such as the video display frame rate prior to negotiation for QoS guarantees. This paper proposes an on-line probe-based algorithm to specify initial application QoS for continuous media and to determine the critical degradation point when performance degrades and adaptive mechanisms should be applied. This probe-based algorithm should be part of a negotiation phase. We will show the applicability of the probe-based algorithm on several VOD service experiments. The results show that it is worthwhile to perform probes in advance if the probe time is small with respect to the duration of the movie/video clip. The advantage of using on-line probes in QoS specification is that the negotiated QoS value represents a realistic application QoS with respect to the current load of the VOD system.

Reference-contexts: In the algorithms described below we show only the storage of measured values which contribute to finding the degradation point. Note that our algorithm aims to bound the difference between measured values, which is applicable to time series <ref> [1] </ref>. For example, when a video stream shows a frame rate of 10-12 frames/second, we want to bound the frame rate difference (degradation) to 5 frames/second because degradation between 12 frames and 6 frames/second is noticeable and may disturb the viewer (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multimedia distributed services such as Video-On-Demand (VOD) are at the center of our study. VOD services use the client/server model. The server is a local (neighborhood) multimedia storage server and includes a database of movies and other video clips <ref> [2] </ref>. The client provides front-end operations such as reception, decompression, display and control of the multimedia data. The network provides the communication between clients and the server. Such a VOD architecture is shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: At the network level, the QoS adaptation is mostly considered as a congestion control mechanism. The source starts to send traffic and the network monitors it. If congestion is observed at a switch, feedback information is sent back via different protocols to the source to slow down the traffic <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Congestion at the network level, and hence QoS adaptation, can be avoided if sources negotiate a rate contract with the network and the sources obey the negotiated contract using traffic shaping mechanisms [8].

Reference-contexts: The Ethernet setup is the standard IEEE 802.3, using CSMA/CD for packet transmission.

The general setup of the video server and clients for IP-over-ATM is shown in Figure 3. The iPOINT (Illinois Pulsar Optical Interconnect) provides five input/output ports.

Reference-contexts: the client/server sides, (2) the transport protocol stack used by the VOD service, (3) CPU utilization by other applications during the runtime of the actual application, and (4) the underlying network. * Off-line Testing Another approach to QoS specification is to run extensive off-line tests to pre-determine the QoS parameters <ref> [6] </ref>. The QoS parameters are then stored in configuration files and retrieved when the negotiation phase begins. The problem with this approach is that it does not take into account the actual load when a VOD service runs. <p> The client/server software shown in Figure 4 runs over the UDP/IP protocol stack with short video clips as probes. The duration of the video clips is maximal 5 minutes (I parameter in the probe-based algorithm). This software is used by the application negotiation protocol <ref> [6] </ref>. The UDP/IP stack uses two networks, namely Ethernet and ATM. We call the experiments over Ethernet the Ethernet Setup and the experiments over ATM the ATM Setup.

Reference-contexts: The question is: How do we determine what is the possible QoS for the client/server VOD service? Hence, we are considering (1) the determination of the application (QoS) <ref> [7] </ref> such as the actual "play" frame rate of a continuous media stream at the client side before the user begins negotiation of application QoS, and (2) the adaptation of application QoS utilizing information from the determination phase.

Reference-contexts: Congestion at the network level, and hence QoS adaptation, can be avoided if sources negotiate a rate contract with the network and the sources obey the negotiated contract using traffic shaping mechanisms <ref> [8] </ref>. An example of a network protocol which negotiates network resource availability and adapts accordingly to the traffic feedback is the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)[9].
