Abstract: We model a two-eye visual environment composed of natural images and study its effect on single cell synaptic modification. In particular, we study the effect of binocular cortical misalignment on receptive field formation after eye opening. We show that binocular misalignment affects PCA and BCM learning in different ways. For the BCM learning rule this misalignment is sufficient to produce varying degrees of ocular dominance, whereas for PCA learning binocular neurons emerge in every case. fl also at Faculty of Exact Sciences Tel-Aviv University

Reference-contexts: The more monocular BCM neurons also tend to develop a small non-zero disparity. The results for BCM neurons are in agreement with biological findings (LeVay and Voigt, 1988) and with a, recently introduced, disparity tuning model <ref> (Berns et al., 1993) </ref>. Despite this agreement with some disparity tuning results, it is important to remember that our simulations do not attempt to model disparity tuning.

They are not necessarily optimal when the goal is classification and the data are not normally distributed <ref> (see for example, p. 212, Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. A simple interpretation of the Hebbian learning rule is that, with appropriate stabilizing constraints, it leads to the extraction or approximation of principal components.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is now generally accepted that receptive fields in the visual cortex of cats are dramatically influenced by the visual environment <ref> (for a comprehensive review see, Fregnac and Imbert, 1984) </ref>. In normally reared animals, the population of sharply tuned neurons increases monotonically, whereas for dark reared animals it initially increases, but then almost disappears (see, for example, Imbert and Buisseret, 1975).

Reference-contexts: It has even been shown that preferred orientations can be directly altered by pairing the preferred orientation with a negative current, and the non-preferred orientation with a positive current <ref> (Fregnac et al., 1992) </ref>. The issue of cortical input misalignment and its relation to receptive field development, has been studied by Pettigrew (1974).

Reference-contexts: Using the same visual environment, we have shown that misalignment in the synaptic density function generates various degrees of ocular dominance under a BCM rule, but fails to do so under a PCA rule, where only binocular cells emerge. This makes the BCM more consistent with biological findings <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962) </ref>. We have also shown that while this misalignment does not prevent cells from becoming selective to all directions under a BCM rule, it is unable to overcome the slight horizontal bias in natural images so that only horizontal selective cells emerge under a PCA rule.

Reference-contexts: In that region, their maximal response turns out to be on the focal plane (zero disparity) (Figures 5,7). The more monocular BCM neurons also tend to develop a small non-zero disparity. The results for BCM neurons are in agreement with biological findings <ref> (LeVay and Voigt, 1988) </ref> and with a, recently introduced, disparity tuning model (Berns et al., 1993). Despite this agreement with some disparity tuning results, it is important to remember that our simulations do not attempt to model disparity tuning.

However, when retinal preprocessing is included, oriented solutions can be attained (Shouval and Liu, 1995).

Reference-contexts: Binocularly deprived kittens retain a high degree of misalignment. Furthermore, the reduction in misalignment, occurs concurrently with the development of orientation selectivity, ocular dominance and disparity tuning <ref> (Movshon and van Sluyters, 1981) </ref>. Thus, it follows that modeling of receptive field development should take into account this misalignment. Blakemore and Van Sluyters (1975) have suggested that plasticity may be needed in animals with binocular vision, in order to overcome a developmental misalignment between cortical inputs.

Reference-contexts: This type of misalignment may be caused by an imprecise developmental alignment of the arbor functions from both eyes. We compare the outcomes that result from two learning rules: PCA <ref> (Oja, 1982) </ref> and BCM (Bienenstock et al., 1982; Intrator and Cooper, 1992). We have chosen to examine these two because they are well defined, and have stable fixed points.

Reference-contexts: In the cat, the most abundant type near the fovea are the X cells. They are linear, i.e., their response to an image that is composed of several components is roughly the sum of the response to the independent components <ref> (Orban., 1984) </ref>. The effect of the retinal preprocessing is modeled by convolving the images with a difference of Gaussians (DOG) filter, with a center radius of one pixel ( 1 = 1:0) and a surround radius of three ( 2 = 3) 2 .

The more binocular BCM neurons are, the smaller the misalignment between their RF centers. In contrast, the displacement of cortical inputs, with single cell PCA learning always leads to binocular and horizontal cells.
