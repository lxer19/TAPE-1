Abstract: The Level 1 missing transverse energy trigger for the CMS detector at the LHC is investigated. At a luminosity of 10 34 cm 2 s 1 , a fast parametrized simulation predicts a Level 1 Trigger rate, with an 80 GeV nominal threshold and jj &lt; 2:6, of 2.4 kHz; for jj &lt; 5, the trigger rate is 760 Hz. For jj &lt; 2:6, with a nominal threshold of 80 GeV, the missing transverse energy trigger achieves 54.2% efficiency for SUSY events of any missing E t value with an efficiency of 90% only when the true missing E t of the SUSY events is above 193 GeV. For jj &lt; 5, with a nominal threshold of 80 GeV, 90% efficiency for SUSY events is achieved only when the true missing E t of the SUSY events is over 171 GeV. The poor efficiency turn on is because the missing E t measured by the Level 1 Trigger minus the true missing E t of the SUSY events is found to have a Gaussian distribution with a of 46 GeV and a mean of -36 GeV for jj &lt; 2:6, and with a of 42 GeV and a mean of -36 GeV for jj &lt; 5. Some slightly different missing transverse energy trigger schemes do not improve the performance significantly. These rates, efficiencies, and resolutions are different from those found simply using the particles generated by Pythia. The effects of different detector effects on the rates and resolutions are explained. With a 2.4 kHz rate and a cutoff of 80 GeV, the missing transverse energy trigger alone provides 54.2% efficiency for SUSY events for jj &lt; 2:6. Jet and total energy triggers supplement the missing E t trigger to provide 69.4% efficiency for SUSY events for jj &lt; 2:6.

The energies deposited in the preshower are not available to the Level 1 Trigger, and so are disregarded for the purposes of this study. According to the Particle Data Group <ref> [4] </ref>, electrons and photons on average lose energy according to a gamma distribution dE = E 0 fi (ff) where t is in units of radiation lengths, and with ff and fi parameters fitted to the distribution. <p> We performed a GEANT simulation of the energy deposit of electrons in PbWO 4 , and fit the average energy deposition to the above formula, to determine ff and fi for electrons as a function of electron energy. According to the Particle Data Group <ref> [4] </ref>, fi is the same for photons and for electrons, and ff fl = ff e + fi.
