Abstract: Wavelet-based video codecs provide a hierarchical structure for the encoded data, which can cater to a wide variety of applications such as multimedia systems. The characteristics of such an encoder and its output, however, have not been well examined. In this paper, we investigate the output characteristics of a wavelet-based video codec and develop a composite model to capture the traffic behavior of its output video data. Wavelet decomposition transforms the input video in a hierarchical structure with a number of subimages at different resolutions and scales. The top-level wavelet in this structure contains most of the signal energy. We first describe the characteristics of traffic generated by each subimage and the effect of dropping various subimages at the encoder on the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. We then develop an N-state Markov model to describe the traffic behavior of the top wavelet. The behavior of the remaining wavelets are then obtained through estimation, based on the correlations between these subimages at the same level of resolution and those wavelets located at an immediate higher level. In our paper, a three-state Markov model is developed. The resulting traffic behavior described by various statistical properties, such as moments and correlations, etc., are then utilized to validify our model.

Reference-contexts: After wavelet decomposition, multiresolution motion estimation is performed on the hierarchical structure using block-based search scheme <ref> [1] </ref>. Since in a wavelet decomposed video there is no concept of blocks, we define a motion block by partitioning the decomposed subimages into small squares similar to what is done in a DCT-based scheme.

Reference-contexts: In addition, multi-resolution motion estimation techniques are incorporated to improve the coding efficiency. It has been shown that the MAW video codec either outperforms the MPEG-based video codec or provides equal performance quality, in terms of complexity, bit rate offered and the signal-to-noise ratio 2 at that rate <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.1 Encoding Schemes for a Full-motion Video Sequence Full-motion video implies that there are various motion activities present in the sequence, ranging from high to low, as opposed to only very low to meduim motion in video conferencing setup. <p> Therefore, the term motion-adaptive is used specifically in this context of motion estimation and compensation. It has been shown that motion-adaptive bi-directional motion compensation (B-frames in MPEG terminology) actually results in a lower data rate <ref> [3] </ref> than one without the bidirectional scheme. In this study, we only focus on backward prediction for simplicity reasons: a smaller buffer is sufficient for the decoding and the encoded data need not be sent out of order.

Reference-contexts: Markov model to describe its traffic characteristics, while the remaining ones are then obtained through estimation, based on the correlations between subimages at different level of the pyramid structure. 2 Motion-adaptive Wavelet-based Video Codec In this study, we consider the encoded data, generated by a motion-adaptive wavelet-based (MAW) video codec <ref> [4] </ref>. The MAW video codec employs wavelet decomposition for signal representation rather than utilizing the traditional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as specified in the Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG) standards [2]. In addition, multi-resolution motion estimation techniques are incorporated to improve the coding efficiency. <p> It is well known that the actual distribution of energy in different subimages of the multiresolution motion compensated video depends on many factors including the wavelet filter-bank, the video sequence itself, the motion compensation scheme used, and, the amount and direction of motion present in the video <ref> [4] </ref>. The legend in the above figures show the correct order in which the signal-to-noise ratio and the bit rate deteriorates as it is a little hard to judge without colored lines.
