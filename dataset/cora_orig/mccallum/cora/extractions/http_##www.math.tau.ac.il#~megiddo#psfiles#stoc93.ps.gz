Abstract: Abstract. The subject of this paper is finding small sample spaces for joint distributions of n discrete random variables. Such distributions are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form P r(E) = . We show that the problem of deciding whether there exists any distribution satisfying a given set of constraints is NP-hard. However, if the constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them which is supported by a "small" sample space (one whose cardinality is equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of n independent random variables, a small sample space can be constructed in polynomial time. This last result is also useful for de-randomizing algorithms. We demonstrate this technique by an application to the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs.

Reference-contexts: Our constructions can easily be extended to variables with different ranges. The probability space associated with these variables is = f0; . . .; r 1g n . A distribution is a map f : ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that P Page 1 We define the set S (f ) = fx 2 j f (x) &gt; 0g to be the essential sample space of f . <p> Most of the previous work has focused on constructing approximations to such distributions. Joffe [9] first demonstrated a construction of a joint distribution of n d-wise independent random variables with an essential sample space of cardinality O (n d ). Luby [10] and Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [1] </ref> generalize Joffe's construction to non-uniform distributions. In many cases, these constructions only approximately satisfy the required constraints; that is, the distributions are d-wise independent, but the probabilities Pr (X i = b) may differ from the corresponding probabilities in the original distribution. <p> In Section 4 we show an example of how our technique can be applied to de-randomization of algorithms. We discuss the problem of finding a large independent set in a d-uniform hyper-graph. The underlying randomized algorithm, described in <ref> [1] </ref>, was de-randomized in the same paper for fixed values of d. It was later de-randomized also for d = O (polylogn) in [6] and [11]. We show how this algorithm can be de-randomized for any d. <p> This result holds even for binary valued random variables (r = 2). Theorem 3.3. It is NP-hard to recognize whether for a given set of simple constraints C there exists a set P = fp i0 ; p i1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> : i = 1; . . . ; n; p i0 + p i1 = 1g such that all the members of C are independence constraints relative to P . Proof: We prove the theorem by reduction from SAT. <p> For the sake of simplicity and for ease of comparison, we will base our analysis on a single problem. This is the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs. The problem description and the randomized algorithm for its solution are taken from Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [1] </ref>. We point out that a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem is known [4]. <p> This has probability Pr (fY &lt; kg " fX 2kg) &gt; 2 3 : De-randomization I The de-randomization procedure of Alon, Babai, and Itai <ref> [1] </ref> is based on constructing a joint distribution of d-wise independent variables which Page 9 approximates the joint d-wise independent distri-bution of variables X i for which Pr (X i ) = 3k=n (i = 1; . . . ; n). It is then necessary to analyze this approximate distribution. <p> Since the number of constraints is jC II j = jC 2 j + E j 2E 2 + m2 d ; this results in a polynomial-time algorithm for d = O (log n), which applies to a larger class of graphs than the one presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. At first glance, it seems that as we have polynomially many neighborhoods of logarithmic size, Schul-man's technique [14] can also be used to extend the results in [1]. However, his approach is limited to uniform distributions, so it does not apply to this algorithm. <p> a polynomial-time algorithm for d = O (log n), which applies to a larger class of graphs than the one presented in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, if it easy to recognize whether a point x in S (f ) is good for a particular input, then it suffices to search any subset of S (f ) which is guaranteed to contain a good point for each possible input. Adleman <ref> [2] </ref> shows that for any distribution f supporting an algorithm in RP, there exists a space S S (f ) of polynomial size that contains a good point for every possible input. The proof of this fact is not constructive, and therefore cannot be used for de-randomizing algorithms.
