Title: Reference Classes and Multiple Inheritances

Abstract: The reference class problem in probability theory and the multiple inheritances (extensions) problem in non-monotonic logics can be referred to as special cases of conflicting beliefs. The current solution accepted in the two domains is the specificity priority principle. By analyzing an example, several factors (ignored by the principle) are found to be relevant to the priority of a reference class. A new approach, Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), is discussed, where these factors are all taken into account. It is argued that the solution provided by NARS is better than the solutions provided by probability theory and non-monotonic logics.

Reference-contexts: For a formal definition of evidence and its weight, see [17]. In NARS, the truth value of a statement, indicating how the statement is supported by available evidence, is represented by a pair of real numbers in <ref> [0, 1] </ref>, &lt; f; c &gt;, where f is w + w , the relative frequency of positive evidence, and c is the confidence. <p> The deduction rule can infer S P &lt; f 0 ; c 0 &gt; from M P &lt; f 1 ; c 1 &gt; and S M &lt; f 2 ; c 2 &gt;. The truth value function is derived from T-norm and T-conorm <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, and the derivation can be found in [17]. The resulting function is: f 0 = f 1 + f 2 f 1 f 2 Now we are ready to see how NARS treats the reference class problem.

Reference-contexts: In such a situation, how can the "reference class method" be justified? It can be derived from a more fundamental principle: the extension (instances) and intension (properties) of a concept is co-ordinated during the development of human classification behavior <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Though it is correct to say that "normality" or "typicality" should not be interpreted in a pure frequentist way as "in most cases", we still have reason to argue that for many purposes, it is better to see them as closely related to empirical evidences, and have different degrees <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. Therefore, it makes sense, and often necessary, to measure the relations between the default rules and available evidence, which cannot be done in the framework of binary logic.

Reference-contexts: How should we empirically determine the membership function for a concept like "white-collar worker"? Psychologists suggest that it can be determined by the degree of similarity of the instance to a prototype [13] or an exemplifier <ref> [8] </ref> of the concept. A common way to determine the similarity between two concepts is to compare their properties. Like the situation of probability prediction, similarity evaluation is also influenced by two factors: the proportion of shared properties and the amount of properties that has been checked during the evaluation.

Reference-contexts: In the field of reasoning under uncertainty, there are (at least) two paradigms that use this type of inference: non-monotonic logics (for example, Touretzky's inheritance network in [15]), and probabilistic reasoning systems (for example, Pearl's Bayesian network in <ref> [9] </ref>).

For the second question, Reichenbach said we need to have complete statistical knowledge on the reference class, that is, the probability for R to be Q should be supported by good statistical data [11].

Reference-contexts: Non-monotonic logics are often referred as "defeasible logic", but actually what is defeasible are only the conclusions derived from the default rules, rather than the rules themselves. The rules are treated as conventions <ref> [12] </ref>, which are immune from empirical revision. As long as "Birds fly" is a default rule, it remains to be valid no matter how many birds found later cannot fly. To treat default rules as convention is possible and even desired in many situations.

Reference-contexts: Obviously it is a simplification. Though we can ignore the boundary cases for "male", the fuzziness in "white-collar worker" cannot be neglected so easily. As argued by fuzzy set theory [19] and prototype theory <ref> [13] </ref>, whether an instance belongs to a concept is usually a matter of degree. This membership function is also related to the current issue: if John can be referred to as a "white-collar worker", but not a typical one, the influence of R 2 will be reduced. <p> How should we empirically determine the membership function for a concept like "white-collar worker"? Psychologists suggest that it can be determined by the degree of similarity of the instance to a prototype <ref> [13] </ref> or an exemplifier [8] of the concept.

Reference-contexts: The judgment from the other reference class is not ignored. In this situation, the reference class competing is solved not by choosing one of them, but by combining the two. Let us see how NARS treats the famous "Nixon Diamond" <ref> [14] </ref>. Putting into the previous framework, in this problem we have "Nixon" as A, "Quaker" as R 1 , "Republican" as R 2 , and "Pacifist" as Q. It is also given that J 1 , J 2 , and J 3 are positive, but J 4 is negative.

Reference-contexts: Then, the prediction can be done by letting the instance "inherit" the information from the class. In the field of reasoning under uncertainty, there are (at least) two paradigms that use this type of inference: non-monotonic logics (for example, Touretzky's inheritance network in <ref> [15] </ref>), and probabilistic reasoning systems (for example, Pearl's Bayesian network in [9]).

In different context, the problem is referred to as "multiple inheritance problem", "multiple extension problem", or "reference class problem" <ref> [3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15] </ref>. <p> Let us see two examples. 1 1. In <ref> [15] </ref>, Touretzky said: "Since Clyde is a royal elephant, and royal elephants are not gray, Clyde is not gray. On the other hand, we could argue that Clyde is a royal elephant, royal elephants are elephants, and elephants are gray, so Clyde is gray. Apparently there is a contradiction here. <p> Even if "Quaker" is given a higher priority, the evidence provided by "Republican" still has its effect on the result. On the other hand, this kind of conflict does not always (though sometimes it does) cause complete indifference or ambiguity, as it does in non-monotonic logics <ref> [15] </ref>. 7 5 Comparisons Compared with non-monotonic logics and probability theory, the processing of the reference class problem in NARS has the following characteristics: 1.

An example, with its variations, will be discussed as a starting point, then, after analyzing the factors that influence the result, the solution provided by Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) <ref> [16, 17, 18] </ref> is discussed and compared with the specificity priority principle. 2 A thought experiment Let us reconstruct Kyburg's example in the following way: Imaging that you are working for a life insurance company, and you need to predict whether John Smith can live to 40. <p> This conclusion from above analysis is consistent with the result of the thought experiment in the previous section. 4 Another approach Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) <ref> [16, 17, 18] </ref> is an intelligent system which works and adapts to its environment under the assumption of insufficient knowledge and resources. As a result of the assumption, it also meets the reference class problem. <p> From the view point of NARS, the confidence of all the default rules (in non-monotonic logics) and probability assignments (in probability theory) is 1, that is, they cannot be revised by accommodating its current evaluation to new evidence. Because in <ref> [16] </ref> we have already argued that revision cannot be done in a first-order probability distribution, let us concentrate on non-monotonic logics here. Non-monotonic logics are often referred as "defeasible logic", but actually what is defeasible are only the conclusions derived from the default rules, rather than the rules themselves.
