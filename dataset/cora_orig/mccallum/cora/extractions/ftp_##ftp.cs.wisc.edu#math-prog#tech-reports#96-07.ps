Abstract: We establish the first rate of convergence result for the class of derivative-free descent methods for solving complementarity problems. The algorithm considered here is based on the implicit Lagrangian reformulation [26, 35] of the nonlinear complementarity problem, and makes use of the descent direction proposed in [42], but employs a different Armijo-type linesearch rule. We show that in the strongly monotone case, the iterates generated by the method converge globally at a linear rate to the solution of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Throughout this paper, we shall assume that F () is continuously differentiable. In the case when F () is affine, NCP (F ) reduces to the linear complementarity problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Among popular approaches to solving NCP (F ) which recently attracted attention, are derivative-free methods based on minimizing appropriate unconstrained or constrained minimization reformulations of the original problem. The literature on derivative-free algorithms is vast; see [11, 42, 15, 24, 14, 20, 34, 43]. <p> Therefore the sequence fx i g is contained in L (M ff ; x 0 ).

Note that no derivatives of F () are needed for computing the search direction or the stepsize in Algorithm 1.

However, the stepsize is computed according to a different rule. Let x 0 be any starting point for Algorithm 1.
