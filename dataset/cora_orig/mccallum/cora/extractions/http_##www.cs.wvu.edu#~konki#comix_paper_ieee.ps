Note: 9. Conclusion and future work A prototype of COMIX has been built, and several applications have been shared with this tool. Only the basic X protocol is supported; extensions are not supported. The chalk-passing mode used in this prototype is the  References [1]  [3] Nye, A.

Abstract: Centralized - The person initiating the session becomes the chairperson and initially has the chalk by default. Other participants can request the chalk; requests are queued, and the chairperson can pass the chalk to any party requesting it. After the chalk-holder party is done, he/she can release the chalk, and the chalk is passed automatically to the chairperson. The chairperson can retrieve the chalk at any time, even if the chalk-holder has not released it. In this case, the chalk-holder is informed before losing the chalk. FIFO (First In First Out) with time limit - In this method, there is a maximum time-limit, M, for which a participant can possess the chalk. If the chalk is free and there is only one request for the chalk, the requester gets the chalk. If the chalk is not free, the requests for chalk are queued. If the chalk-holder has used his/her time-limit, a message is sent that the chalk will be taken away after some period of time, T. After time period T is over, the chalk is automatically given to the first requester in the queue. The chalk-holder can release the chalk any time before time-limit M is over. The chalk-holder can continue to use the chalk for any amount of time after time-limit M if there is no pending request for the chalk. Combination This method combines the centralized and FIFO with time limit modes. The chairperson can get the chalk at any time and can give it to a requester, even if the requester is not the first in the request queue. If the chairperson does not interfere, the control is passed as in FIFO with time limit. I want to thank Robert R. Shank, who gave me good ideas and supported me in the early stages of the development of this system. I also want to thank Dr. Srinivas Kankanahalli, Mary Carriger, and other colleagues at CERC for their support and motivation.
