Title: Protocols Among Computational Agents: Towards a Model based on the Success and Satisfaction

Abstract: To design protocols among computational agents, we have adopted Searle and Vanderveken model of speech acts because this model is a rich theory which can give important properties of protocols that we can formalize properly. To achieve this, we are working on an adequate formalism (the situation calculus) for representing this model in the context of multiagent systems.

Reference-contexts: For study respectively propositions and illocutionary acts, it is needed to use both intensional and illocutionary logics. Previous Extensions of Montague Grammar Some logicians or linguists have recently proposed formal treatments of illocutionary force markers or per-formative verbs in empirical extensions of Montague grammar <ref> (Montague 1974) </ref>. In fact, these applications of Montague grammar to fragments of English have failed. First, they have not succeeded in characterizing adequately the logical structures of the sets of illocu-tionary forces, of propositions, and of speech acts.

Reference-contexts: In facts, domains with these characteristics give rise to three classical problems (frame, ramification and qualification problems). Situation calculus seems to be the adequate formalism for reasoning about actions and their effects on the world since recently, Reiter <ref> (Reiter 1992) </ref> has given a set of conditions under which the explicit specifications of frame problem can be avoided. With situation calculus, we can also encode messages which depend on the words and the situation in which the words are uttered.

Reference-contexts: Introduction According to Singh <ref> (Singh 1991) </ref>, a major bottleneck in the design of multi-agent is the design of the protocols of communication among agents. While agents are usually specified in terms of high-level concepts (belief, intentions, etc.), existant protocols for the communication among those agents are generally poor.

Reference-contexts: Finally, they have not recognized to its full extent the variety and the wealth of actual forms of expression for speech acts. To remedy to the failure in the achievement of Montague's research, Searle and Vanderveken <ref> (Searle and Vanderveken 1985) </ref> and Vanderveken (Vanderveken 1990) proposed a general success and truth conditional semantics which is compatible with Montague grammar.

Reference-contexts: According to S&V, each illocutionary force can be divided into an illocutionary point, a mode of achievement of that point, propositional content, preparatory and sincerity conditions, and degree of strength. For details about these components see <ref> (Vanderveken 1990) </ref>. <p> Finally, they have not recognized to its full extent the variety and the wealth of actual forms of expression for speech acts. To remedy to the failure in the achievement of Montague's research, Searle and Vanderveken (Searle and Vanderveken 1985) and Vanderveken <ref> (Vanderveken 1990) </ref> proposed a general success and truth conditional semantics which is compatible with Montague grammar. Illocutionary Logic Searle and Vanderveken theoretically enrich Mon-tague's intensional logic in order to have an adequate logic for the analysis of speech acts and the interpretation of sentences of all types.
