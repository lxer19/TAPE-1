Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of designing conversational agents that exhibit appropriate gaze behavior during dialogues with human users. Previous research on gaze behavior has concentrated on its relationship to turn-taking phenomena [3,4,5]. Recent work has incorporated some of these findings into the design of autonomous humanlike conversational agents and interactive communicative humanoids [1,13]. However, none of this research has examined the relationship between information structure and gaze behavior. In this paper we discuss why turn-taking is not an adequate explanation for gaze behavior in conversation and why information structure should be integrated with turn-taking as an explanation for this behavior. We then examine the relationship of gaze behavior to information structure and turn-taking through an empirical analysis of discourse transcripts for several dyadic conversations. A simple algorithm for assigning gaze behavior is proposed on the basis of the findings of this empirical analysis. We describe work in progress on implementing this algorithm in an existent communicative humanoid agent [14] with the goal of producing more natural gaze behavior related to propositional content in human-computer conversations.

Reference-contexts: Goodwin <ref> [5] </ref> elaborates on the role of gaze in turn-taking by also considering the gaze of the hearer and the coordination of the gaze of conversational participants. He claims that the speakers look away at the beginning of turns occurs to avoid overloading information in the planning of an utterance. <p> By employing such a model, we are attempting to formalize Goodwins suggestion that gaze behaviors (and the consequent restarts, pauses, and hesitations) are indicative of the speakers attention to the construction of coherent sentences for his recipient <ref> [5] </ref>. We follow Halliday [6] in using the terms theme and rheme to describe information structural components of an utterance. Other terms, such as link and focus have been widely used in the literature and are roughly synonymous (cf. [17]).

Reference-contexts: The present research follows this discourserelated approach by concentrating on the flow of information between conversants and the informational threads that affect gaze behavior. One way of modeling such discourse phenomena is through information structure <ref> [6] </ref>, which describes the relationship between the content of utterances (or clauses) and the emerging discourse context. Information structure allows the representation of information within an utterance to be connected with the knowledge of the speaker and hearer and the structure of their discourse. <p> By employing such a model, we are attempting to formalize Goodwins suggestion that gaze behaviors (and the consequent restarts, pauses, and hesitations) are indicative of the speakers attention to the construction of coherent sentences for his recipient [5]. We follow Halliday <ref> [6] </ref> in using the terms theme and rheme to describe information structural components of an utterance. Other terms, such as link and focus have been widely used in the literature and are roughly synonymous (cf. [17]). <p> In doing so, we wished to also repair a rift between two fields of study. The study of turn-taking has been the purview of conversational analysis (inter alia [3,5,10]), a field derived from sociology. The study of discourse structure (inter alia, <ref> [6] </ref>) has been the domain of linguists, who often neglect to talk to sociologists. And computational work that models language use perpetuates a similar divide (compare [7] with [9]). But theme and rheme (information structure) are, like turn-constructional-units, an account of the accumulation of information.

Reference-contexts: Because of research by Duncan, Goodwin, and others, gaze behavior has come to represent the cue to turn-organization and has been used as such in the design of embodied conversational agents.

Reference-contexts: Then the hearer looks at the speaker and nods; this backchannel communication is followed by a speaker continuation signal consisting of a look away from the hearer, if the speaker intends to hold the turn. Thrissons research <ref> [13] </ref> on interactive communicative humanoids uses a situated model of turn-taking based on Sacks et al. [10,11]. According to Sacks et al., turn-taking is a phenomenon in which rules are subject to the control of the participants and emergent patterns arising from the interaction of the rules.

Reference-contexts: attach a look-away from the hearer endif else if current proposition is rhematic if end of turn or distribution (.73) attach a look-toward the hearer endif endfor Multimodal Dialogue Generation for a Conversational Agent The algorithm described above is being implemented in Gandalf, an animated agent originally developed by Thrisson <ref> [14] </ref> to interact with human users within a tightly constrained topic domain (the solar system). Gandalf interprets the users speech, gaze, and gestures 1 return produces appropriate facial expressions, gestures, and spoken responses. <p> In this case, gaze behavior is signaling a particular kind of relationship between information structure and turn-taking. We are currently implementing the algorithm proposed here in Gandalf, an existing communicative humanoid agent <ref> [14] </ref>, to provide it with capabilities for more natural gaze behavior related to propositional content. We would like to use a similar algorithm, along with information about intonation, to predict when rhematic units occur in input - that is, when users have uttered the key contribution of their utterance.

Reference-contexts: His efforts are mainly focused on defining the nature of the underlying perceptual mechanisms. User testing of Thrissons conversational agent showed that presence of these nonverbal feedback behaviors (gaze, nods, beat gestures) diminished disfluency on the part of users and increased perceived efficiency of the humanoid agent <ref> [15] </ref>. Information Structure Whittaker et al. [16] addresses how speakers signal information about discourse structure, beyond the level of the individual utterance, to hearers looking at the mechanism for shifts of control in conversations. <p> Although these additional nonverbal behaviors are subtle, Thrisson et al. <ref> [15] </ref> confirms that such minute behaviors, supportive of ongoing communication, increase believability and effectiveness. Conclusions and Future Work Previous research on gaze behavior has focused primarily on its role in turn-taking. However, as our data shows, turn-taking only partially accounts for the gaze behavior in discourse.

Reference-contexts: We follow Halliday [6] in using the terms theme and rheme to describe information structural components of an utterance. Other terms, such as link and focus have been widely used in the literature and are roughly synonymous (cf. <ref> [17] </ref>). The theme represents the part of the utterance that links it to the previous discourse and specifies what the utterance is about. The rheme, on the other hand, specifies what is contributed to the discourse with respect to the theme.
