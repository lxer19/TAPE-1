Affiliation: Object Design Inc  
Abstract: The ObjectStore ODBMS utilizes a number of architectural facilities that provide a very-high level of performance in a variety of industrial software systems. The understanding of ObjectStore's architecture and the resulting performance envelope is important for achieving optimal results in these systems. This paper describes the performance characteristics of ObjectStore, for both controlled benchmark tests and actual deployed application programs. The factors affecting performance are discussed and a taxonomy of application programs using ObjectStore is presented. Finally, future development directions are outlined.
