Abstract: Scheduling tasks among cooperative agents requires tradeoffs between various factors including task priorities and context-dependent execution times. We have specifically been investigating the space of functions for evaluating alternative distributed task schedules for multi-operator applications. In this paper, we describe some candidate functions and converge on intuitively appealing functions, which we show to lead to equivalent preferences over distributed schedules. We then look at the computational complexity of finding schedules that (approximately) optimize this function. When context-switching costs are thrown into the mix, moreover, the complexity becomes even more daunting. To address these problems, this paper summarizes our work on forging correspondences between our problems and those studied in operations research. Moreover, we have developed a new hill-climbing strategy for solving these problems, and in this paper we show that these strategies yield very good performance within the range of parameter settings that are representative of our application domain.

The context switching problem is the same in the relaxed case of a single operator and equal processing times for tasks.

Reference-contexts: Context switches between tasks can also be viewed as a hindering relationship between tasks. Task relationships, such as hinders, enables, facilitates, and precedence are computationally described in the TMS (Task Analysis, Environment Modeling, and Simulation) framework <ref> [5] </ref>. TMS provides a method for modeling complex computational task environments. A TMS model aims to analyze, explain, or predict the performance of a system or some part of it.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we are looking at the latter application domain; TAIPE (Tactical Assistants for Interaction Planning and Execution) is a system designed for the Navy to help automate ship operation <ref> [6] </ref>. In TAIPE interaction plans determine the functional components that must be used to manage a display dialogue for operators to process tasks. A crew of operators needs to apply their abilities to process the most important tasks quickly while considering the inherent difficulty of jumping between dissimilar tasks.

Reference-contexts: For example, the cost function is known in operations research as weighted average completion time or total weighted completion time. The corresponding decision problem, Scheduling to Minimize Weighted Completion Time, is strongly NP-complete for an arbitrary number of machines and is pseudopolynomial for a fixed number of machines <ref> [7] </ref>. What this means is that we need to consider techniques for simplifying or approximating the calculations. 4.1. Simplifying strategies Several simplifications of the problem ignore factors that introduce complexity. These factors include the distribution across multiple operators, the nonuniform priorities, and the nonuniform execution times. <p> Performance Evaluation Function m-Machs.

Reference-contexts: If we can relax one of these, we can generate simpler strategies for generating optimal schedules. If we assume there is no distribution, the problem becomes very easy. For the single machine case, schedules are optimized by applying Smiths Rule <ref> [15] </ref>, which orders tasks according to priority / execution_time ratios. If we assume uniform priorities, computing a distributed schedule is similarly easy. <p> Priorities 1 U priority response time i i _ O (nlogn) [3] U priority response time i i _ O (nlogn) [3] 3 C pri resp time i i i U cum priority t dt time period _ j NPC [7] 1|| w C j j Smiths Rule O (nlogn) <ref> [15] </ref> j SJF O (nlogn) [3] Performance Evaluation Function No Exec.
