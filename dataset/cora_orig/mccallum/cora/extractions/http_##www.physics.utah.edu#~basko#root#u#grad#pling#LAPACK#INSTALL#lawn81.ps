Title: LAPACK Working Note 81 Quick Installation Guide for LAPACK on Unix Systems 1  
Author: Jack Dongarra and Susan Ostrouchov 
Date: REVISED: VERSION 2.0, September 30, 1994  
Address: Knoxville, Tennessee 37996-1301  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Tennessee  
Abstract: This working note describes how to install, test, and time version 2.0 of LAPACK, a linear algebra package for high-performance computers, on a Unix System. Non-Unix installation instructions and further details of the testing and timing suites are only contained in LAPACK Working Note 41, and not in this abbreviated version.

The auxiliary routines are listed in LAPACK Working Note 41 [3] and the LAPACK Users' Guide [1]. 4.2 Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS The BLAS are a set of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms that perform vector-vector, matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix operations. <p> The operation counts used in computing the megaflop rates are computed from a formula; see LAPACK Working Note 41 <ref> [3] </ref>. The eigenvalue timing program is used with the eigensystem routines and returns the execution time, number of floating point operations, and megaflop rate for each of the requested subroutines. <p> The input files reside in LAPACK/TESTING. For more information on the test programs and how to modify the input files, please refer to LAPACK Working Note 41 <ref> [3] </ref>. If you do not wish to run each of the tests individually, you can go to LAPACK, edit the definition testing in the file Makefile to specify the data types desired, and type make testing. This will compile and run the tests as described in sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.2. <p> For more information on the timing programs and how to modify the input files, please refer to LAPACK Working Note 41 <ref> [3] </ref>. If you do not wish to run each of the timings individually, you can go to LAPACK, edit the definition timing in the file Makefile to specify the data types desired, and type make timing. <p> For example, for the nonsymmetric eigenvalue routines, you could use only one matrix of type 4 instead of four matrices of types 1, 3, 4, and 6. Refer to LAPACK Working Note 41 <ref> [3] </ref> for further details. d) Run the programs for each data type you are using.
