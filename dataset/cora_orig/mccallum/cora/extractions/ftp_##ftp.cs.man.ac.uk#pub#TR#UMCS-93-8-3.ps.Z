Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Diodorean modal logics S4:3 and S4:3:1 have received much attention in the literature because of their interpretation as logics of dense and discrete linear time <ref> [1] </ref>. The logics S4 and S4:14 can be given interpretations as logics of dense and discrete branching time. Using a technique due to Hintikka and Rautenberg we obtain sound and complete cut-free tableau systems for each logic. <p> The D mentioned by Bull is S4:3:1 but Zeman [18, page 245] merely shows that his tableau procedure for S4:3 goes into unavoidable cycles when attempting to prove Dum. Zeman does not investigate remedies and consequently does not give a tableau system for S4:3:1. In fact, Bull <ref> [1] </ref> mentions that Kripke used semantic tableau for S4:3:1, in 1963, but he gives no reference and subsequent texts 21 that use semantic tableau do not mention this work [18].

Reference-contexts: Rautenberg [10] refers to "a simple tableau" system for S4:3 but does not give details since his main interest is in proving interpolation, and S4:3 lacks interpolation. In subsequent personal communications I have been unable to ascertain the S4:3 system to which Rautenberg refers [12]. Bull <ref> [2] </ref> states that "Zeman's Modal Logic (XLII 581), gives tableau systems for S4:3 and D in its Chapter 15, : : : ".

Reference-contexts: The name S4:14 is due to Zeman. Therefore, the logics S4, S4:3, S4:3:1 and S4:14 cover the four possible combinations of discreteness and density paired with linearity and branching. 2 Modal Tableau Systems The most popular tableau formulation is due to Smullyan as expounded by Fitting <ref> [4] </ref>. Following Rautenberg [10, 11], we use a slightly different formulation where formulae are carried from one tableau node to its child because the direct correspondence between sequent systems and tableau systems is easier to see using this formulation. <p> In fact, Fitting makes these signs explicit in his signed tableau <ref> [4] </ref>. In our tableau systems, the formulae from the right side of the sequent ! appear with an extra negation sign in the tableau node carrying [ :: Hence the "subformulae" we need to consider in our tableaux must contain the negated versions of the sequent subformulae. <p> The (S4) rule can be seen as a "jump" to the world where :P eventually becomes true <ref> [4] </ref>. The same argument shows that (S4) is sound for S4:3:1-frames and for S4:14-frames. Proof for (S4:3): The (S4:3) rule is based on a consequence of the characteristic S4:3 axiom 3. Adding 3 to S4 gives a weakly-connected R for S4:3 so that eventualities can be weakly-ordered. <p> eliminated by building thinning in a deterministic way into the transitional rules (S4) and (S4:14): For example, we can change (S4) 2X; :P X; :2P with X 0 = f2Q j2Q 2 Xg and simultaneously changing the basic axiomatic tableau rule from (0) 0 X; P ; :P see Fitting <ref> [4] </ref>. In terms of sequent systems this just says that a given proof of ! in CL can be converted into a proof of ! in CL 0 either by moving applications of weakening into the (new) axiomatic leaf sequents, or into the (new) transitional rules (in a deterministic way).

Reference-contexts: Each (cut-free) tableau system has a (cut-free) sequent analogue thereby proving that Gentzen's cut-elimination theorem holds for each system. The resulting tableau systems are of interest from a theorem proving perspective since they are directly implementable in Prolog using a technique due to Fitting <ref> [5] </ref>. 1.1 Preliminaries The logics S4:3, S4:3:1 and S4:14 are all normal extensions of S4 and are axiomatised by taking the rule of necessitation and modus ponens as inference rules, and by taking the appropriate formulae from Figure 1 as axiom schemas. <p> It is also well known that although contraction becomes essential, it is required only for 2-formulae in most normal modal logics, and on both 2-formulae and 3-formulae in some symmetric normal modal logics <ref> [5] </ref>. We have deliberately built contraction into our rules to highlight this fact. We believe that if we interpret ";" as multiset union, and rework our formulation using multisets instead of sets, then all the proofs will still go through with appropriate modifications.

Reference-contexts: A nondegenerate cluster is simple if it consists of a single reflexive world. Note that in a nondegenerate cluster, R is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.

Consequently, between any two points there is always a third and S4:3 is said to model linear dense time. It can be shown that h!; i j= A iff ` S4:3:1 A where ! is the set of natural numbers [6]. <p> Consequently, between any two points there is always a third and S4:3 is said to model linear dense time.

Hence, between any two points there is always a finite number (possibly none) of other points and S4:3:1 is said to model linear discrete time. <p> The correspondence between hI; i and S4:3-frames, and between h!; i and S4:3:1-frames can be obtained by bulldozing proper clusters and defining an appropriate mapping called a p-morphism <ref> [6] </ref> [8]. It can be shown that S4 is also characterised by the class of all reflexive transitive (and possibly infinite) trees [8, page 120]. <p> That is, the rule of contraction appears to be eliminable from our systems as long as the static rules build in contraction as given by our rules. Unfortunately, the proofs become very messy. 18 9 Further Work The logics S4:3 and S4:3:1 respectively have counterparts called K4DLX and K4DLZ <ref> [6] </ref> that omit reflexivity where the new axiom schema are: D 2A ) 3A; X 22A ) 2A; and It is known that hI; &lt;i j= A iff ` K4DLX A h!; &lt;i j= A iff ` K4DLZ A where I is either the set of real numbers or the set <p> ) 3A; X 22A ) 2A; and It is known that hI; &lt;i j= A iff ` K4DLX A h!; &lt;i j= A iff ` K4DLZ A where I is either the set of real numbers or the set of rational numbers and ! is the set of natural numbers <ref> [6] </ref>.

Note however that this seems to require a cut rule since Hughes and Cresswell use maximal consistent sets rather than saturated sets as we do. Clearly the intuitions inherent in our semantic methods are no longer enough to prove that weakening is eliminable.

Following Rautenberg <ref> [10, 11] </ref>, we use a slightly different formulation where formulae are carried from one tableau node to its child because the direct correspondence between sequent systems and tableau systems is easier to see using this formulation. <p> Each tableau rule is read downwards as "if the numerator is satisfiable, then so is one of the denominators". A tableau calculus CL is a finite collection of tableau rules identified with the set of its rule names. Following Rautenberg <ref> [10] </ref>, a CL-tableau for X is a finite tree T with root X whose nodes carry finite formula sets stepwise constructed by the rules of CL according to: if a rule with n denominators is applied to a node then that node has n successors with the proviso that if a <p> 2 [ [ X n giving a CL-saturated set X fl : Since each rule carries subsets of X fl L to subsets of X fl L and we start with X X fl L we have X X fl X fl L : * The following definition from Rautenberg <ref> [10] </ref> is central for the model constructions. <p> then there exists some w 0 2 W with wRw 0 and :P 2 w 0 ; (iii) if wRw 0 and 2P 2 w then P 2 w 0 : 8 Lemma 4 If hW; Ri is a model graph for X then there exists an L-model for X <ref> [10] </ref>. Proof: For every p 2 P, let #(p) = fw 2 W j p 2 wg. <p> Using simultaneous induction on the degree of A 2 w it is easy to show that (a) A 2 w implies w j= A and (b) :A 2 w implies w 6j= A: By (a), w 0 j= X hence hW; R; #i is an L-model for X <ref> [10] </ref>. * This model graph construction is similar to the subordinate frames construction of Hughes and Cresswell [8] except that Hughes and Cresswell use maximal consistent sets and do not consider cycles, giving infinite models rather than finite models. 3 Soundness of CL A formula :2P is called an eventuality since <p> Theorem 2 If X is a finite set of formulae and X is CL-consistent then there is an L-model for X on a finite L-frame hW; Ri. Proof for CS4: The construction of the model graph is due to Rautenberg <ref> [10] </ref> where OE denotes the immediate successor relation. <p> Some of the tableau rules we have given are not standard; for example, the (T ) rule is usually given as: X; P where 2P is not carried from the numerator into the denominator <ref> [10] </ref>. It is well known that the rule of contraction, which is implicit in the set formulation, then becomes essential for completeness. <p> The non-reflexive counterpart of S4:3Grz is KLG (sometimes called G:3 or GL lin or K4:3W) where L is as above and G is the Godel-Lob axiom 2 (2A ) A) ) 2A: Rautenberg <ref> [10] </ref> shows that KG is characterised by the class of finite transitive trees of irreflexive worlds. <p> Shimura [14] has given a syntactic proof of cut-elimination for the corresponding sequent system for S4:3, whereas we give a semantic proof. Apparently, Serebriannikov has also obtained this system for S4:3 but I have been unable to trace this paper. Rautenberg <ref> [10] </ref> refers to "a simple tableau" system for S4:3 but does not give details since his main interest is in proving interpolation, and S4:3 lacks interpolation. In subsequent personal communications I have been unable to ascertain the S4:3 system to which Rautenberg refers [12].
