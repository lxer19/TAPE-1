Abstract: The advent of ubiquitous computing and the proliferation of portable computing devices have raised the importance of mobile and wireless networking. At the same time, the popularity of group-oriented computing has grown tremendously. However, little has been accomplished to-date in bringing together the technologies for group-oriented communication and mobile networking. In particular, most modern wireless/mobile and ad hoc networks do not provide support for multicast communication. A major challenge lies in adapting multicast communication to environments where mobility is unlimited and outages/failures are frequent. This paper motivates the need for new multicast routing protocols aimed specifically at fully-mobile (ad hoc) networks. Our premise is that, due to their inherent broadcast capability, wireless networks are well-suited for multicast communication. Unlike the evolution of routing in wired networks, we believe that|in ad hoc networks|it is more effective to treat multicast routing as a separate problem. The paper also identifies outstanding research issues pertaining to multicast routing in mobile and ad hoc networks, and discusses one possible approach to multicast routing and packet forwarding in ad hoc networks. Subject Category: Mobility, wireless multimedia. Keywords: Multicast, routing, ad hoc networks. fl This work is being supported in part by a grant from Hughes Research Laboratories (GP3044-97261).

Reference-contexts: Multicast communication in mobile networks only very recently became a topic of active research. Although Multicast Routing Issues in Ad Hoc Networks (Obraczka and Tsudik) Page 2 there has been some work in reliable message delivery in networks with mobile hosts <ref> [1] </ref>, little has been done in the area of multicast routing for mobile environments. The main reason appears to be a popular belief that|similarly to the evolution of Internet routing|multicast routing in mobile networks will be built on top of the unicast routing infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: However, when a host is continuously moving, building the multicast tree every time is inefficient. On the other hand, in cellular networks, typically only the first hop changes. Therefore, instead of building source-specific multicast trees, routing using group-specific trees (e.g., core-based tree multicast routing <ref> [2] </ref>) will likely work well. Changing sender's addresses may also raise higher-level issues such as how to piece together data sent by the same host while moving.

Reference-contexts: Multicast for Mobile Hosts. As mentioned in Section 8 above, the issues raised by multicast routing in mobile networks with fixed infrastructure are confined to the first and/or last hops depending on whether the source and/or receiver (s) are mobile. The work described in <ref> [4] </ref> uses Mobile IP tunnels to solve the first/last hop problem associated with endpoint mobility in multicast delivery. To handle multicast source mobility, the mobile source establishes a tunnel to its home agent.

Reference-contexts: TORA's approach is based on building a directed acyclic graph (DAG) rooted at the destination. Besides route creation, TORA also implements route maintenance and route deletion in the case of partitions. The two-level hierarchical unicast routing algorithm for AHNs presented in <ref> [5] </ref> uses a spine for intra-cluster routing and a link-state algorithm for routing among clusters. For each cluster, a spine is computed using a minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) algorithm. Shortest-path routes are computed between the spine and other cluster members.

The two modes of Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [6] </ref> (sparse and dense modes) are a case in point. Large, Widely Distributed AHN: An Example It appears highly unlikely that vanilla hyper-flooding will work well in populous and geographically distributed AHNs as it is primarily geared towards small and very dynamic AHNs. <p> The only current research effort in the field is the Shared-Tree Wireless Network Multicast (ST-WIM) algorithm [3].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, different variations of hyper-flooding can be evaluated for different types of AHN environments and endpoint mobility patterns.

Another candidate simulator is UCLA's Maisie network simulator [19]. One of the challenges raised by simulating mobile networks in general, and AHNs in particular, is defining "typical" AHN behavior, endpoint mobility patterns, multicast group membership dynamics, and end-user workloads.

Each mobile endpoint maintains a route cache where they keep previously learned source routes. When an endpoint needs to send a packet, it performs a route cache lookup for the corresponding destination.
