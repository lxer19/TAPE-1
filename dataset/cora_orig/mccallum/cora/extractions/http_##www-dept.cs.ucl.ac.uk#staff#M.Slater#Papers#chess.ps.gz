Abstract: This paper describes an experiment to assess the influence of immersion on performance in immersive virtual environments. The task involved TriDimensional Chess, and required subjects to reproduce on a real chess board the state of the board learned from a sequence of moves witnessed in a virtual environment. Twenty four subjects were allocated to a factorial design consisting of two levels of immersion (exocentric screen based, and egocentric HMD based), and two kinds of environment (plain and realistic. The results suggest that egocentric subjects performed better than exocentric, and those in the more realistic environment performed better than those in the less realistic environment. Previous knowledge of chess, and amount of virtual practice were also significant, and may be considered as control variables to equalise these factors amongst the subjects. Other things being equal, males remembered the moves better than females, although female performance improved with higher spatial ability test score. The paper also attempts to clarify the relationship between immersion, presence and performance, and locates the experiment within such a theoretical framework.

Reference-contexts: The dependent variable (p) was taken as the number of 6 or 7 answers to the three questions as stated above. This situation may be treated by logistic regression <ref> (Cox, 1970) </ref>, where the dependent variable is binomially distributed ("number of successes out of 3 trials"), with expected value related by the logistic function to a linear predictor (Appendix A).

Reference-contexts: Considering the visual display as an example, at the most basic level the important factors may be field of view, resolution, colour resolution, binocular disparity. Corresponding behaviours from the point of view of presence are those autonomic responses governed by the visual system such as vergence and accommodation <ref> (Ellis, 1991) </ref>. At a higher level the realism of the content of the visual display may be considered - such as whether objects behave in accordance with physical laws.

Reference-contexts: As before (Slater, Usoh and Steed, 1995) an alternative score was constructed by combining the three presence question scores into a single scale using principal components analysis <ref> (Kendall, 1975) </ref>. The first principal component is the linear combination of the original variables that maximises the total variance. The second is orthogonal to the first and maximises the total residual variance. The first two principal components accounted for 83% of the total variation in the original three variables.

Reference-contexts: Altogether there were a total of 7732 triangles in the garden environment and 6276 in the plain environment (consisting only of the TDC system). Further description of the process of object construction can be found in in <ref> (Linakis, 1995) </ref>. The frame rate offered on the ProVision system is not guaranteed at any particular level of performance. It varied between 15 and 20Hz depending on the complexity of the data in view at any particular time.

Reference-contexts: For example, a vivid visual display system might afford some individuals a sense of "presence", but be unsuited for others in the absence of sound <ref> (Slater, Usoh and Steed, 1994) </ref>. The second variable is the extent of the match between proprioception and sensory data.

Reference-contexts: The specific purpose of the SAT is to test the ability of a person to create, retain and manipulate mental images by mentally "folding" flat patterns into 3D objects <ref> (Smith and Whetton, 1988) </ref>. Each subject had to do this test, and a standard score was derived from their answers. The higher the score, the greater the ability of the subject to mentally derive 3D structure when from 2D visual input, according to the principles of these tests.

Reference-contexts: They are inclusive to the extent that all external sensory data (from physical reality) is shut out. Their vividness is a function of the variety and richness of the sensory information they can generate <ref> (Steuer, 1992) </ref>. Vividness is concerned with the richness, information content, resolution and quality of the displays. Finally, immersion requires that there is match between the participant's proprioceptive feedback about body movements, and the information generated on the displays.
