Abstract: The experiments of the model were limited by two factors. One is that the angular velocity obtained is depend-ant on the error model of the dead-reckoning mechanism in the robot, meaning that the orientation predicted by the HD system drifts faster than that estimated by dead-reckoning. This turns out to be a problem, because the model will not learn the orientation-to-feature association properly if there is too big an error in its prediction of the head direction. Therefore we temporarily use the best available estimation, i.e., the dead-reckoned orientation to limit the drift in the HD system. This is the reason that in Figure 5 (a) the CC curve has in general a tendency to follow the NCC curve. Since the only counterpart in the robot to the vestibular system is gyro which is not available in our experiment setup, this limitation is expected to be removed later by using a gyro to provide angular velocity. The other factor is the continuity of the detected feature. They often stretch a certain angle covering several HD units, as illustrated in Figure 5 (c) where only those features which generate the calibration tics in Figure 5 (a) are shown, and the others are mapped to the feature zero. The continuity of a detected feature makes it difficult to select the right calibration point in the HD units associated with the feature. Tests with ideal odometric parameters have shown that all wrong calibrations result from the wrong selection of the calibration point, suggesting that the selection process of a calibration point from a H-set, see Section 4.2, should be improved. In summary, the preliminary experiments we have carried out so far show that the suggested model is able to modify the internal orientation of the robot by using learned environmental features. In the future we need to improve the resolution of the model and to examine to which degree the behaviour of the model conforms with the data of existing behavioural experiments in animal navigation.
