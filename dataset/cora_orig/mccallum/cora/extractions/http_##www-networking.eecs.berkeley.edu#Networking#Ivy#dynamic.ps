Abstract: We explore a dynamic approach to the problems of call admission and resource allocation for communication networks with connections that are differentiated by their quality of service requirements. In a dynamic approach, the amount of spare resources is estimated on-line based on feedbacks from the network's quality of service monitoring mechanism. The schemes we propose remove the dependence on accurate traffic models and thus simplify the tasks of supplying traffic statistics required of network users. In this paper we present two dynamic algorithms. The objective of these algorithms is to find the minimum bandwidth necessary to satisfy a cell loss probability constraint at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch. We show that in both schemes the bandwidth chosen by the algorithm approaches the optimal value almost surely. Furthermore, in the second scheme, which determines the point closest to the optimal bandwidth from a finite number of choices, the expected learning time is finite.

Reference-contexts: This requires a resource allocation scheme that takes into account the traffic statistics and the QoS requirements of each connection. Prior studies propose the following static approach to the resource allocation problem <ref> [9, 12] </ref>. <p> Thus the resources to be shared among users are the output buffer space and the output bandwidth. Assume that there are a fixed number I of traffic classes that are differentiated by their QoS requirements. For the output line buffer, we adopt the architecture proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> (see figure 2). The total buffer space is divided into I first-in-first-out buffers (FIFOs), with each FIFO serving one traffic class. Note that the sizes of the FIFOs are not necessarily the same. The output bandwidth is shared among the classes through a framing scheme as follows. <p> A fixed number T total of time slots constitute a frame. Define fi as the total bandwidth of an output line. Then class i traffic is guaranteed fi T i =T total transmission bandwidth when it is given priority in T i slots in each frame. <ref> [9] </ref> suggests that the slots assigned to each class should be evenly distributed in a frame to reduce delay variance. To simplify the analysis, we assume that the size of each FIFO is fixed; only the bandwidth is allocated dynamically.
