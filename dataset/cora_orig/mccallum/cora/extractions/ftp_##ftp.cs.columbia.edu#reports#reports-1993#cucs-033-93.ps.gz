Title: Minimal Path Length of Trees with Known Fringe  
Author: Roberto De Prisco Giuseppe Parlati Giuseppe Persiano 
Abstract: Technical Report CUCS-033-93 Abstract In this paper we continue the study of the path length of trees with known fringe as initiated by [1] and [2]. We compute the path length of the minimal tree with given number of leaves N and fringe for the case N=2. This complements the result of [2] that studied the case N=2. Our methods also yields a linear time algorithm for constructing the minimal tree when N=2.

Reference-contexts: Because of this large gap, it is an important problem to study the path length of a binary tree when additional information on the tree is available or the tree is of some special form (see, for example [4, 5]). Klein and Wood <ref> [1] </ref> were the first to consider the case in which, besides the number N of nodes, the fringe (i.e., the difference between the longest and the shortest root-leaf path) is known.

Reference-contexts: This algorithmic construc tion of the minimal tree can be also used for the maximal tree obtaining an algorithm similar to the one of <ref> [7] </ref>. Notice that the range of variation of L is O (log (N )). 4 The Lower Bound In this section we analyze PL (T L ) as a function of L.
