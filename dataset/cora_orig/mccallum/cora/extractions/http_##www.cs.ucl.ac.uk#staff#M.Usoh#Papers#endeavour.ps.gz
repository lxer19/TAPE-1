Abstract: Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE) technology has made it possible for computers to accommodate to humans in a way which is more natural, in terms of human behaviour, than most other human-computer interfaces. A virtual world allows human participants to perform tasks as "naturally" as they would do in everyday reality. Therefore no special learning of skills is required in order to carry out common place activities (such as picking something up) in such environments. To go through a door in the virtual world would be similar to the real world. This intuitive approach is a key factor which has moved virtual environments closer to the ultimate human-computer interface, allowing anyone to effectively communicate with the environments that computers display, irrespective of their age, experience, class, or cultural background.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Steven Ellis of NASA Ames defined virtualisation as "the process by which a human viewer interprets a patterned sensory impression to be an extended object in an environment other than that in which it physically exists" <ref> [1] </ref>. In a virtual environment, the patterned sensory impressions are delivered to the senses of the human participant through computer generated displays (visual, auditory, tactile and kinesthetic).

Reference-contexts: This idea of immersion in a virtual reality (VR) is not new. It was proposed by Ivan Sutherland in 1965 <ref> [2] </ref>, and realised in 1968 [3] with a head-mounted display (HMD) that could present the wearer with a stereoscopic three dimensional view of a computer generated world. This was coupled to a six degree of freedom mechanical sensing device which tracked the wearer's head movements.

Reference-contexts: Virtual Reality Technology Todays head-mounted displays are generally helmetlike with two liquid crystal display TVs positioned in such a way that each is only visible to one eye - one for the left and one for the right <ref> [4] </ref>, [5]. Therefore, as with normal vision a slightly different image is seen by each eye, and these stereoscopic views are integrated by the human visual system and interpreted as three dimensional (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: The position of the wearer's head is tracked using electromagnetic (wireless) constructions to determine the position and orientation of sensors on the HMD in relation to an external source <ref> [6] </ref>. In order to influence the computer generated world we also need a device which will allow us to interact with it. This device often comes in the form of a special glove or 3D mouse.

Reference-contexts: This is achieved by the world being controlled by several independent computer modules which process information concurrently <ref> [9] </ref>. A graphics module is responsible for the conversion of the object's geometric representation into visual images on the graphics display.

Reference-contexts: It is important to understand the factors that contribute to this, and a means of quantifying the concept of presence itself. 5 We have distinguished between two kinds of factors that contribute to the state of presence - external and internal <ref> [10] </ref>. External factors are those which are created by the virtual reality system or manifest themselves through the media. These factors have been discussed by [11]-[15]. Their exact nature and degree with which they can influence a participant's sense of being in the virtual environment is yet unclear. <p> This has led us, through communications with subjects experiencing immersive virtual spaces, to investigate the relation between presence and the virtual body <ref> [10] </ref>. We have some experimental evidence that the operation of the virtual body (VB) within the environment has a strong positive effect on the sense of presence for most people. Here we take virtual body as a self-representation of the human which responds to the movements of their own body.

Reference-contexts: Internal factors, however, determine the responses of different people to the same externally produced stimuli. These concern how the perceptions generated by the IVE are mediated through the mental models and representation systems that structure the participant's subjective experiences <ref> [16] </ref>. Generally a person who processes information in a visually dominant manner will experience the world in a different way than a person who is auditorially dominant. This can affect their degree of presence in the same virtual environment which has say, high quality graphics but low quality sound reproduction.

Reference-contexts: For example, since current tracking systems limit the participant in terms of range it means that they cannot simple walk around the work area unconstrained. It was through investigations into the human factors of matching proprioceptive data with sensory feedback and hence maintaining or enhancing the sense of presence <ref> [17] </ref> that led us to a solution for this hardware problem. We have derived a technique for navigation based on whole body motions termed the virtual treadmill [18].
