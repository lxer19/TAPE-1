Abstract: We describe a method for introducing variations into predefined dance sequences using a chaotic mapping. A symbol sequence representing a dance piece is mapped onto a chaotic trajectory, establishing a symbolic dynamics that links the dance sequence and the attractor structure. A choreographic variation on the original piece is created by generating a trajectory with slightly different initial conditions, inverting the mapping, and using special corpus-based interpolation schemes to smooth any abrupt transitions. Sensitive dependence guarantees that the variation is different from the original; the attractor structure and the symbolic dynamics guarantee that the two resemble one another in both esthetic and mathematical senses.

Reference-contexts: This work was catalyzed by a paper by Diana Dabby <ref> [1] </ref> that proposes a similar map-ping that creates musical variations. The core idea here is the same, but many of the issues and tactics | and much of the mathematics | are very different. The symbol set is one obvious distinction.

Reference-contexts: When such a transition is encountered in the chaotic variation, we use a forward-backward modified Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> to find the shortest path between the respective vertices of the two body states and then insert the corresponding move sequence into the gap. This scheme is quite coarse-grained; to better model and enforce the nuances of a dance genre, we need to improve it.

Reference-contexts: Voronoi diagrams [6] | the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of adjacent pairs of points | are an effective solution to this problem; see figure 1 for an example.

Reference-contexts: In figure 1, for instance, every tenth trajectory point (shown circled) generates a cell. The symbol set used here represents the position of each of the 44 primary joints in the human body with a quaternion | a standard representation in rigid-body dynamics, dating back to Hamilton <ref> [4] </ref>. A quaternion consists of a vector ~u 2 R 3 and a scalar r that specifies the angle of rotation around that vector.

Reference-contexts: Though a symbolic representation abstracts away much detailed information about the dynamics, it preserves many of its invariant properties; see, e.g., Hao <ref> [5] </ref> for details. Establishing a symbolic dynamics presents two problems: the partition and the ordering. <p> spurious numerical effects. 4 This representation | a symbolic dynamics induced by that dance sequence | is conjugate to the R n dynamics of ! (x 0 ), which is interesting in that it implies that the animations are formally equivalent, in a precise mathematical sense, to the "real" dynamics <ref> [5] </ref> 3 Interpolation The re-mapping procedure described in the previous section introduces abrupt transitions in the chaotic variation | places where consecutive body positions would require physically impossible or stylistically illegal moves.

Reference-contexts: Creating a partition for the purposes of re-mapping a dance sequence requires tiling the state-space region occupied by the attractor with N nonoverlapping cells, where N is the number of moves in the sequence. Voronoi diagrams <ref> [6] </ref> | the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of adjacent pairs of points | are an effective solution to this problem; see figure 1 for an example.
