Abstract: Voltage graphs are a powerful tool for constructing large graphs (called lifts) with prescribed properties as covering spaces of small base graphs. This makes them suitable for application to the degree/diameter problem, which is to determine the largest order of a graph with given degree and diameter. Many currently known largest graphs of degree 15 and diameter 10 have been found by computer search among Cayley graphs of semidirect products of cyclic groups. We show that all of them can in fact be described as lifts of smaller Cayley graphs of cyclic groups, with voltages in (other) cyclic groups.

Reference-contexts: Actually, this fact has led to the introduction of the vertex-transitive version of the degree/diameter problem, which is finding the largest order -d;k of a vertex-transitive graph of degree d and diameter k. Quite recently the current authors have argued <ref> [6] </ref> that the covering graph construction has a very good potential for producing examples of large graphs of given degree and diameter. Roughly speaking, this method enables to "blow up" a given base graph to a larger graph (called lift) which is a regular covering space of the base graph. <p> The lift is best described in terms of the base graph and a mapping, called voltage assignment, which endows (directed) edges of the base graph with elements of a finite group. A self-contained introduction to the topic is provided in Section 2. As shown in <ref> [6] </ref>, many of the currently known largest examples of graphs of given degree and diameter can indeed be obtained by the covering graph construction. <p> For a much more detailed exposition of the theory of voltage assignments and lifts we refer to [17]. We conclude this Section by illustrating the concepts introduced above in the following useful observation (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>). Lemma 1 Let ff be a voltage assignment on a graph G in a group .

Reference-contexts: ~ A is a lift of A as well, because ~ B r ~ A = ~ A. (Observe that the automorphisms ~ B r themselves are lifts of the identity automorphism of G.) The following theorem was proved in [18] in a map-theoretical setting; for a graph-theoretical proof see <ref> [25] </ref>. Theorem 1 Let G be a connected graph, let ff be a voltage assignment on G in a finite group , and let A be an automorphism of G. <p> At a first glance, this result may seem not easily applicable, because it involves checking all closed walks. However, there is an easy way to reduce the checking to a number of walks proportional to the number of edges of G; see <ref> [25] </ref> for details. Moreover, the structure of the base graph G may sometimes be simple enough to check the above condition directly. An example of such a situation can be found in [22] where vertex-transitivity of the lifts follows from Theorem 1 (although in [22] a different method was used). <p> Knowing that a lift is a Cayley graph, it is natural to ask about the structure of the underlying group of the lift. A general theory on covering Cayley graphs with Cayley graphs is outlined in <ref> [25] </ref>. Here we just consider the special case referred to in Theorem 2.

Reference-contexts: A straightforward inspection shows that the lifted group ~ A fl acts transitively (and, due to the above counting, regularly) on the vertex set of the lift. By a classical theorem of Sabidussi <ref> [27] </ref>, the lift H ff is a Cayley graph (for the group ~ A fl ). Knowing that a lift is a Cayley graph, it is natural to ask about the structure of the underlying group of the lift.

Reference-contexts: The theory of voltage graphs and their lifts can be viewed as a discretization of the well known theory of covering spaces in algebraic topology applied to 1-dimensional cell complexes, i.e., graphs. (There are other viewpoints as well, known as theory of quotient graphs or divisors [7], equitable partitions <ref> [28] </ref>, or colorations [24].) The covering graph technique itself appears frequently as a tool in algebraic combinatorics; we may mention e.g., the computation of spectra of covering graphs [7, 14], the theory of distance-regular graphs [14], a construction of infinitely many cubic 5-arc-transitive graphs [4], or constructions of cages [5].
