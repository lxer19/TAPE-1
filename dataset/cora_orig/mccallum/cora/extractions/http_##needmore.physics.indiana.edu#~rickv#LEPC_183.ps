Abstract: A search for charginos, predicted by supersymmetric theories, has been performed using a data sample of 6:5 pb 1 at centre-of-mass energies of 181-183 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. No evidence for chargino production has been found. An upper limit on the chargino pair production cross section has been obtained as a function of chargino mass m ~ W (fl) boson and the lightest neutralino. For large chargino masses the limits are improved with respect to the previous analyses at lower centre of mass energies. Exclusion regions at 95% C.L. of parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) are determined. Within this framework the 95% C.L. lower mass limit on the lightest chargino, assuming m ~ Disclaimer: This note describes preliminary OPAL results to be submitted to the International Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics Jerusalem, Israel This note should be read with the previous publication CERN-PPE/97-083.

Reference-contexts: This note describes a chargino search using the new data with an identical analysis to that presented in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. Charginos searches have previously proceeded using data collected near the Z peak (LEP1), at p (LEP1.5) [3], at 161 GeV [4] and at 170-172 GeV [2] by OPAL and the other LEP collaborations [5].

Charginos searches have previously proceeded using data collected near the Z peak (LEP1), at p (LEP1.5) [3], at 161 GeV [4] and at 170-172 GeV [2] by OPAL and the other LEP collaborations [5]. In this note, various event simulations which have been used are described in Section 2. <p> The analysis is identical to the one described in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. Data are used from runs in which all the subdetectors relevant to this analysis were fully operational, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6:5 pb 1 . The luminosity is measured using small angle Bhabha scattering events detected in the silicon-tungsten calorimeter. <p> The category A selection criteria are described in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. The acoplanarity angle distributions are shown in Fig. 1 after cut (A2). The distributions of the observed invariant mass of the event (M vis ) are shown in Fig. 2 after the acoplanarity angle cut in (A3). <p> The details of the category (B) selection criteria are described in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. The distributions of P HCAL t are shown in Fig. 3 after cut (B1). The distribution of M rest after cut (B3) is shown in Fig. 4. The numbers of events remaining after each cut are listed in Table 4. <p> The details of the category (C) selection criteria are described in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. The P t distributions are shown in Fig. 5 after cut (C1). The distributions of the energy of the higher energy jet are shown in Fig. 6 after cut (C5). <p> These systematic errors are considered to be independent and are added in quadrature (7-12%). The systematic errors in luminosity, Monte Carlo statistics and modelling of the cut variables in Monte Cralo are newly evaluated. Other systematic errors are taken from the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The systematic errors on the luminosity, the Monte Carlo statistics and the modelling of the cut variables in Monte Cralo (both signal and background processes) are newly evaluated. The estimated values of other systematic errors are taken from the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. The rate of events in which the measured energy in the SW, FD or GC calorimeters, due to noise and beam related background, exceeded the thresholds in the preselection is about 4.5% as estimated from random beam crossing events. <p> To compute the 95% C.L. on upper limits, the previous results obtained at p s = 172 GeV <ref> [2] </ref> have been combined with the present results. For the combination of results from different energies it is assumed that the cross-sections are proportional to ~ fi=s, where ~ fi is the momentum of the final state ~ + 1 in the centre-of-mass system normalised to the beam energy.
