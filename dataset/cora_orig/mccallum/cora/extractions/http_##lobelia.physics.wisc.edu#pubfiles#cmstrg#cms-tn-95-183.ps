Abstract: We examine the efficiency and rates of the CMS Calorimeter Level 1 Trigger as presented in the CMS Technical Proposal for selecting the events needed for use in the CMS physics program described in the Proposal. Specific signals investigated include top decays to electrons, Standard Model Higgs decays to electrons and photons, signals from SUSY Higgs, and Gluino production. A variety of masses and SUSY parameters are investigated. The efficiencies are studied at the luminosity 10 33 cm 2 s 1 or 10 34 cm 2 s 1 depending on the expected rate of events as assumed in the CMS Technical proposal. A single set of Level 1 Calorimeter energy thresholds for electrons, jets and missing energy is selected to provide a 15 kHz rate at each of the two luminosity settings considered. It is shown that this set of cuts provides sufficiently high efficiency and satisfies CMS physics goals as stated in the Technical Proposal. We also explore the rate of B Physics signals that pass this high p t trigger.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present physics performance results from a simulation of a conceptual design [1] of a level 1 calorimeter trigger system for the CMS detector. The simulation program and the performance of the trigger design are discussed in a previous note <ref> [2] </ref>. In this note, we examine the high p t physics processes discussed in the CMS Technical Proposal (TP) [3] and determine the efficiency of the baseline calorimeter level 1 trigger to accept these events. <p> The algorithms implemented and data used in the baseline design are discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. We briefly summarize them here. 2.1 Input Data The calorimeter level 1 trigger system receives digital trigger sums on an eight bit compressed scale. Programmable tables will enable full flexibility to modify the compression algorithm as required. <p> The trigger system will use memory lookup tables to decode the 8-bit compressed scale data into a linear scale with a 10 bit dynamic range in the adder tree. The mapping of physical calorimeter towers into trigger towers is discussed in reference <ref> [2] </ref>. There is a 1:1 correspondence between the HCAL and ECAL trigger towers. The trigger tower size is equivalent to the HCAL physical towers, :0873 fi :0873 in fi . <p> The trigger hardware allows for a fully programmable energy scales and cut values. The actual values of scales and cuts will have to be tuned in test runs using real data. For this simulation study we have tuned the energy scales and the cuts using the fast simulation program <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. Details of the performance of this algorithm and discussion of options using fine-grained calorimeter information are found in [5] and [6]. <p> Missing E t , single hadron and total E t triggers also make use of the 0:35 fi0:35 transverse energies [7]. 3 Simulation Program We used a fast simulation program <ref> [2] </ref> to evaluate the performance of the calorimeter trigger. This program used the Pythia Monte Carlo to simulate several hundred thousand QCD jet and other physics events of interest. The response of the CMS detector was simulated for these events using a simplified geometry with a parameterized detector response. <p> The appropriate number of calorimeter tower energies are added to obtain trigger tower data. Both ECAL and HCAL trigger tower data were further reduced in resolution and dynamic range to account for the 8 bit quadlinear scale input <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. 4 QCD Background Rates The individual calorimeter level 1 triggers are combined into a set of triggers used to provide the final trigger decision.

Reference-contexts: The simulation program and the performance of the trigger design are discussed in a previous note [2]. In this note, we examine the high p t physics processes discussed in the CMS Technical Proposal (TP) <ref> [3] </ref> and determine the efficiency of the baseline calorimeter level 1 trigger to accept these events. The general trigger conditions proposed by CMS have been shown to have a high acceptance for physics processes of interest to CMS while keeping background rates below the 100 Hz archival storage limit [4]. <p> 10 33 cm 2 s 1 . a low cost, may enable a dedicated t trigger which will enhance these efficiencies further. 8 Gluino and Squark Searches We have examined the performance of the calorimeter level 1 trigger on gluino and squark production following the CMS Technical Proposal "Scenario A" <ref> [3] </ref>. "Scenario B" presented in the Technical Proposal is very similar from the trigger point of view and is, therefore, not considered.

The purpose of this note is to show that the specific algorithms and hardware function proposed for the CMS level 1 calorimeter trigger preserve this physics, while keeping background rates within DAQ limits.
