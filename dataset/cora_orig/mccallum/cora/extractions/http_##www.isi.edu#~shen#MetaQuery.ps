Abstract: This chapter presents a framework that uses metaqueries to integrate inductive learning methods with deductive database technologies in the context of knowledge discovery from databases. Metaqueries are second-order predicates or templates, and are used for (1) Guiding deductive data collection, (2) Focusing attention for inductive learning, and (3) Assisting human analysts in the discovery loop. We describe in detail a system that uses this idea to unify a Bayesian Data Cluster with the Logical Data Language (LDL++), and show the results of three case studies, namely, discovering regularities from a knowledge base, discovering patterns and errors from a large telecommunication database, and discovering patterns and errors from a large chemical database. The patterns discovered using metaqueries are implication rules with probabilities. These rules can link information from many tables in databases, and they can be stored persistently for multiple purposes, including error detection, integrity constraints, or generation of more complex metaqueries. Recent progress in knowledge discovery from databases (Cercone and Tsuchiya 1993; Piatetsky-Shapiro 1993) has shown that inductive hypothesis generation, deductive hypothesis verification, and human intituation, are all crucial components for an effective discovery system. Inductive learning is essential for generating hypotheses from data automatically, deductive database technology is a natural tool for gathering evidence in support of existing hypotheses, while human intuition (which may be inspired by the results of machine discovery) is necessary for generating and selecting the most promising hypotheses in a practical manner. However, the integration of these three components

Reference-contexts: The above ideas are implemented in a system called the Knowledge Miner (KM). Up to date, the induction component of KM is an unsupervised Bayesian Data Cluster (Shen 1994), and the deduction component of KM is a state of the art deductive database technology called LDL++ <ref> (Naqvi and Tsur 1989, Arni, Ong, Tsur, and Zaniolo 1993) </ref>, which is well suited for both knowledge representation and data querying. Under this implementation, the patterns discovered under metaqueries are actual LDL++ rules, and their usage is very flexible.

Reference-contexts: Cyc is a large common-sense knowledge base developed at MCC, containing over one million logical assertions (think of them as relations if you like). We applied an earlier version of the Knowledge Miner system <ref> (Shen 1992) </ref> to two large collections of objects in Cyc: Person and Organization. At the time, the Person collection contained 633 objects and 77 relevant relations, while the Organization collection contained 1550 objects and 150 relevant relations.

Reference-contexts: Thus, less useful metaqueries will not be suggested to the users. Another way to generate metaqueries is to generalize the existing rules. For example, the system BLIP <ref> (Theime 1989) </ref> uses the heuristic of "turning constants to variables" to acquire metalevel rules from domain-level rules entered by users. The Metaquery Generator is by no means complete. We have yet to generate complex queries automatically.

One significant difference between IMACS and the Recon or our metaqueries approach is that the former loads all data into memory from databases for processing while the latter two systems interface database directly and retrieve data as needed at processing time.
