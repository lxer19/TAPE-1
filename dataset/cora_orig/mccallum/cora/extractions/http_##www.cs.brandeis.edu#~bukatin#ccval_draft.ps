Abstract: The existence of deep connections between partial metrics and valuations is well known in domain theory. However, the treatment of non-algebraic continuous Scott domains have been not quite satisfactory so far. In this paper we return to the continuous normalized valuations on the systems of open sets and introduce notions of co-continuity (fU i ; i 2 Ig | filtered system of sets ) (Int( i2I U i )) = inf i2I (U i )) and strong non-degeneracy (U V | open sets ) (U ) &lt; (V )) for such valuations. We call the resulting class of valuations CC-valuations. The first central result of this paper is a construction of CC-valuations for Scott topologies on all continuous dcpo's with countable bases. This is a surprising result because neither co-continuous, nor strongly non-degenerate valuations are usually possible for ordinary Hausdorff topologies. Another central result is a new construction of partial metrics. Given a continuous Scott domain A and a CC-valuation on the system of the Scott open subsets of A, we construct a continuous partial metric on A yielding the Scott topology as u(x; y) = (A n (C x " C y )) (I x " I y ), where C x = fy 2 A j y v xg and I x = fy 2 A j fx; yg is unboundedg. This construction covers important cases based on real line and allows to obtain an induced metric on T otal(A) without unpleasant restrictions known before.

Reference-contexts: Keimel also pointed out that our results are quite surprising, because both co-continuity and strong non-degeneracy, U V | open sets ) (U ) &lt; (V ), seem contradictory, as neither of them can hold for the system of open sets of the ordinary Hausdorff topology on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. However, if we replace the system of open sets of this Hausdorff topology with the system of intervals, both conditions would hold. <p> Thus, it is possible to consider co-continuity as a method of dealing with non-discreteness of Scott topology. We follow here the remarkable definition of a discrete topology given by Aleksandrov: a topology is discrete if an intersection of arbitrary family of open sets is open (e.g. see <ref> [1] </ref>). Of course, if one assumes the T 1 separation axiom, then the Aleksandrov's definition implies that all sets are open | the trivial version of the definition, which is unfortunately the only one found in the most textbooks. <p> Thus, x 62 Int (B) ) k2B X w (k) + w (x) &gt; k2Int (B) Since P k2B w (k) = inf k2K x (U k ) the Lemma is proved. 2 3.2 A Vertical Segment of Real Line Consider the segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, v=. Define ((x; 1]) = 1 x. Unfortunately, to ensure strong non-degeneracy we have to define ([0; 1]) = 1 + *, * &gt; 0. This is the first hint that strong non-degeneracy might constitute too strong restriction in many cases. <p> We observe, that for every such pair we can construct a special kind of vertical chain, which "behaves like a vertical segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of real line". We call such chain a stick. We assign weights, v (k 0 ; k 00 ) &gt; 0, to sticks as well, in such a way that the sum of all w (k) and all v (k 0 ; k 00 ) is 1. <p> As in Subsection 3.1, compact elements k contribute w (k) to (U ), if k 2 U . An intersection of the stick, associated with a continuously connected pair 7 (k 0 ; k 00 ), with an open set U "behaves as either (q; 1] or <ref> [q; 1] </ref>", where q 2 [0; 1]. Such stick contributes (1 q) v (k 0 ; k 00 ) to (U ). The resulting is the desired CC-valuation. <p> An intersection of the stick, associated with a continuously connected pair 7 (k 0 ; k 00 ), with an open set U "behaves as either (q; 1] or [q; 1]", where q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Such stick contributes (1 q) v (k 0 ; k 00 ) to (U ). The resulting is the desired CC-valuation. It is possible to think, that a complete lattice homomorphism from the lattice of Scott open sets to [0; 1] is associated with every compact element and with <p> either (q; 1] or [q; 1]", where q 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Such stick contributes (1 q) v (k 0 ; k 00 ) to (U ). The resulting is the desired CC-valuation. It is possible to think, that a complete lattice homomorphism from the lattice of Scott open sets to [0; 1] is associated with every compact element and with every stick defined by basic continuously connected elements, k 0 and k 00 . Then, as suggested by Keimel [8], all these homomorphisms together can be thought of as an injective complete lattice homomorphism to [0; 1] J . <p> of Scott open sets to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is associated with every compact element and with every stick defined by basic continuously connected elements, k 0 and k 00 .

From this point of view, our construction of is the same as in [8]. <p> Whenever we have an upwardly closed (i.e. Alexandrov open) set U , for any stick fa k 0 ;k 00 r j r 2 (0; 1)g there is a number q k 0 ;k 00 U 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, such that r &lt; q k 0 ;k 00 a k 0 ;k 00 k 0 ;k 00 r 2 U . <p> Given a dcpo A, the tuple of (A; I; M (I); ; Inf o; N eginf o) is called a Info-structure on A, if M (I) P (I) | a ring of subsets closed with respect to "; [; n and including ; and I, : M (I) ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, Inf o : A !

Reference-contexts: The fl A preliminary draft. Version 0.5 1 relationship between partial metrics and valuations was first noticed by O'Neill in [11]. In <ref> [2] </ref> Bukatin and Scott generalized this relationship by considering valuations on powersets of bases, instead of valuations on the domains themselves, as in [11]. They also explained the computational intuition of partial metrics by generalizing them to relaxed metrics, which take values in the interval numbers. <p> However it is often desirable to remove the most restrictive axioms of partial metrics, like small self-distances, u (x; x) u (x; y), and strong Vickers-Matthews triangle inequality, u (x; z) u (x; y) + u (y; z) u (y; y). Thus <ref> [2] </ref> only requires symmetry and the ordinary triangle inequality for the upper bounds of relaxed metrics. <p> This is, essentially, the approach of the Section 5 of <ref> [2] </ref>, where Inf o (x) and N eginfo (x) can be understood as subsets of a domain basis.

However, there was a number of remaining open problems. In particular, while [2] builds partial metrics on all continuous Scott domains with countable bases, the reliance of [2] on the finite weights of non-compact basic elements does not allow to obtain some natural partial metrics on the real-line based domains, and also introduces some unpleasant restrictions on domains which should be satisfied in <p> of the Section 5 of <ref> [2] </ref>, where Inf o (x) and N eginfo (x) can be understood as subsets of a domain basis. However, there was a number of remaining open problems. In particular, while [2] builds partial metrics on all continuous Scott domains with countable bases, the reliance of [2] on the finite weights of non-compact basic elements does not allow to obtain some natural partial metrics on the real-line based domains, and also introduces some unpleasant restrictions on domains which should be satisfied in order to obtain an induced classical metric on T otal (A). 1.1 Co-continuous Valuations This <p> We deal with the specific infinite systems of sets we need, and mainly focus on quite orthogonal conditions given to us by co-continuity of . 3.1 Example: Valuations Based on Weights of Basic Ele ments This example essentially reproduces a construction in <ref> [2] </ref>. Consider a continuous dcpo A with a countable basis K. Assign the converging system of weights to basic elements: w (k) &gt; 0, P k2K w (k) = 1. Define (U ) = P It is easy to see that is a continuous, normalized, strongly non-degenerate valuation. <p> A lower bound of these U i j and U i 0 j is the desired U i . 2 5 Partial and Relaxed Metrics on Domains The motivations behind the notion of relaxed metric, its computational meaning and its relationships with the partial metrics [10] were explained in <ref> [2] </ref>. Here we focus on the definitions and basic properties, revisit the issue of specific axioms of partial metrics, and mention the relevant open problems. The distance domain consists of pairs &lt; a; b &gt; (also denoted as [a; b]) of non-negative reals (+1 included), such that a b. <p> We include the stronger form in the definition of partial metrics for the purposes of this paper. 5.1 Partial Metrics and Functoriality The Section 8.1 of <ref> [2] </ref> discusses the issue of whether axioms u (x; x) u (x; y) and u (x; z) u (x; y) + u (y; z) u (y; y) should hold for the upper bounds of relaxed metrics. <p> u (x; y)) seems to eliminate these problems. 6 Partial and Relaxed Metrics via Information 6.1 I nf o-structures Some of the earlier known constructions of partial metrics can be understood via the mechanism of common information between elements x and y bringing negative contribution to u (x; y) (see <ref> [2, Section 8] </ref>). This can be further formalized as follows. Assume that there is a set I representing information about elements of a dcpo A. We choose a ring, M (I), of admissible subsets of I and introduce a measure-like structure, , on M (I). <p> The nature of these set-theoretical representations, I, of domains may vary: one can consider sets of tokens of information systems, powersets of domains bases, or powersets of domains themselves, custom-made sets for specific domains, etc. The approach via powersets of domain bases (see <ref> [2] </ref>) can be thought of as a partial case of the approach via powersets of domains themselves adopted in the present paper. 6.2 Partial and Relaxed Metrics via I nf o-structures Define the (upper estimate of the) distance between x and y from A as u : A fi A ! <p> Then we can introduce the lower estimate of the distance l : A fi A ! R + : l (x; y) = (Inf o (x) " N eginfo (y)) + (Info (y) " N eginfo (x)): The proof of Lemma 9 of <ref> [2] </ref> is directly applicable and yields (Inf o (x)"N eginf o (y))[ (Info (y)"N eginfo (x)) Infon ((Inf o (x)"Inf o (y))[(N eginf o (x)"N eginf o (y))) implying l (x; y) u (x; y). <p> Indeed, axiom U V ) (U ) (V ) implies (Inf o (x) " Info (y)) (Info (x)), (N eginfo (x) " N eginf o (y)) (N eginf o (x)), yielding u (x; x) u (x; y). The proof of Lemma 11 of <ref> [2] </ref> goes through. The symmetry u (x; y) = u (y; x) is obvious. Another helpful fact is 3. x v y ) u (x; x) = u (x; y). <p> Theorem 6.1 The function u is a partial metric. The function is a continuous relaxed metric. The relaxed metric topology coincides with the Scott topology. Due to the axiom 8x 2 T otal (A): Info (x) [ N eginfo (x) = I, the proof of Lemma 10 of <ref> [2] </ref> would go through, yielding x; y 2 T otal (A) ) l (x; y) = u (x; y) and allowing to obtain the following theorem (cf. Theorem 8 of [2]). Theorem 6.2 For all x and y from T otal (A), l (x; y) = u (x; y). <p> axiom 8x 2 T otal (A): Info (x) [ N eginfo (x) = I, the proof of Lemma 10 of <ref> [2] </ref> would go through, yielding x; y 2 T otal (A) ) l (x; y) = u (x; y) and allowing to obtain the following theorem (cf. Theorem 8 of [2]). Theorem 6.2 For all x and y from T otal (A), l (x; y) = u (x; y). Consider : T otal (A) fi T otal (A) ! R, (x; y) = l (x; y) = u (x; y). <p> Consider : T otal (A) fi T otal (A) ! R, (x; y) = l (x; y) = u (x; y). Then (T otal (A); ) is a metric space, and its metric topology is the subspace topology induced by the Scott topology on A. 15 However, in <ref> [2] </ref> x 2 T otal (A) ) Inf o (x) [ N eginfo (x) = I holds under an awkward condition of the regularity of the basis. <p> be fruitful to consider replacing the axiom 8x 2 T otal (A): Inf o (x) [ N eginfo (x) = I by something like 8x 2 T otal (A): (I n (Info (x) [ N eginfo (x))) = 0. 6.3 A Previously Known Construction Here we recall a construction from <ref> [2] </ref> based on a generally non-co-continuous valuation of Subsection 3.1. We will reformulate it in our terms of Inf o-structures. In [2] it was natural to think that I = K. <p> by something like 8x 2 T otal (A): (I n (Info (x) [ N eginfo (x))) = 0. 6.3 A Previously Known Construction Here we recall a construction from <ref> [2] </ref> based on a generally non-co-continuous valuation of Subsection 3.1. We will reformulate it in our terms of Inf o-structures. In [2] it was natural to think that I = K. Here we reformulate that construction in terms of I = A, thus abandoning the condition x 2 T otal (A) ) Inf o (x) [ N eginfo (x) = I altogether. <p> Define I x = fy 2 A j fx; yg is unboundedg, P x = fy 2 A j y xg (cf. I x = fk 2 K j fk; xg is unboundedg, K x = fk 2 K j k xg in <ref> [2] </ref>). Define Info (x) = P x , N eginfo (x) = I x . <p> Observe also that since the construction in Section 3.1 does form a CC-valuation for algebraic Scott domains with bases of compact elements, the construction in <ref> [2] </ref> can be considered as a partial case of our current construction if the basis does not contain non-compact elements. Lemma 6.1 Assume that is a co-continuous valuation and B is a directed subset of A. <p> Then (I tB " Q) = sup x2B ((I x "Q)), were Q is an open or closed subset of A. Remark: Co-continuity is not needed here. Proof. During the proof of Lemma 12 in <ref> [2] </ref> it was established that I tB = S x2B I x (think about k 2 A and observe that that proof goes through).

Axioms relating v and Inf o are in the spirit of information systems approach <ref> [13] </ref>, although we are not considering any inference structure over I in this paper. 13 The requirements for negative information are relatively weak, because it is quite natural to have 8x 2 A: N eginfo (x) = ; if A has the top element.

Reference-contexts: The theory of valuations on the open sets underwent a considerable development lately (see <ref> [3, 7, 14] </ref> and references therein). However we have found that we need a special condition of co-continuity for our valuations | for a filtered system of open sets fU i ; i 2 Ig, (Int ( i2I U i )) = inf i2I ((U i )).
