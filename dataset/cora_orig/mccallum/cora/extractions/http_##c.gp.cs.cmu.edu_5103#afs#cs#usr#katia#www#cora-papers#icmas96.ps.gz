Title: Multiagent Coordination in Tightly Coupled Task Scheduling  
Abstract: We consider an environment where agents' tasks are tightly coupled and require real-time scheduling and execution. In order to complete their tasks, agents need to coordinate their actions both constantly and extensively. We present an approach that consists of a standard operating procedure and a look-ahead coordination. The standard operating procedure regulates task coupling and minimizes communication. The look-ahead coordination increases agents' global visibility and provides indicative information for decision adjustment. The goal of our approach is to prune decision myopia while maintaining system responsiveness in real-time, dynamic environments. Experimental results in job shop scheduling problems show that (1) the look-ahead coordination significantly enhances the performance of the standard operating procedure in solution quality, (2) the approach is capable of producing solutions of very high quality in a real-time environment.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Most research on multiagent systems has considered loosely coupled agents (Huhns 1987) <ref> (Bond & Gasser 1988) </ref> (Gasser & Huhns 1989) that coordinate their actions for mutual benefit.

Reference-contexts: In most of these environments, agent interaction occurs only when one agent has data, facts, views, and solutions that are of interest to other agents (Durfee & Lesser 1991), or when agents need to resolve their conflicts (Sycara 1988) <ref> (Conry, Meyer, & Lesser 1988) </ref>, etc. In other words, coordination activity, although essential, does not constitute a substantial part of an agent's effort to achieve its goal.

Reference-contexts: We have also obtained similar results for other objective functions, e.g., makespan. Our future work includes extension to agents in charge of multiple resources and jobs with substitutable resources. The approach is also potentially useful for extending the contract net protocol (CNP) <ref> (Davis & Smith 1983) </ref>. While CNP has been extended to deal with a competitive setting (Fischer et al. 1995) and varying levels of commitment by bounded rational self-interested agents (Sandholm & Lesser 1995), temporal planning (e.g., deadlines, makespan) is very important in many real world problems (e.g., project management).

Reference-contexts: The work focused on complete algorithms for solving DCSPs and was not concerned with solution optimization and time restriction. <ref> (Decker & Lesser 1995) </ref> presented a family of coordination algorithms for distributed real-time schedulers. They considered a task environment where task interrelationships can be explicitly and quantitatively represented as functions that describe the effect of agents' decisions on performance.

In our approach, agents are coordinated by local prioritizing strategies and nonlocal look-ahead information.
