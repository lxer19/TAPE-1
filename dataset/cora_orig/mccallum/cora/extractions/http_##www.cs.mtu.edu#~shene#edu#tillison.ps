Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many CS1 texts, for example Nance [2], and data structures and algorithms texts, for example Baase <ref> [1] </ref> and Sedgewick [3], use insertion sort as an example of elementary sorting algorithms that require O (n 2 ) comparisons to sort n data items. A worst case that forces the insertion sort to take O (n 2 ) comparisons is usually mentioned.
