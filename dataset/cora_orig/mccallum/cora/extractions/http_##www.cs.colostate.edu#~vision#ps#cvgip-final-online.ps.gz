Reference-contexts: Tree Search Early uses of tree search include tactile sensing by Gaston [GLP84] and 2D point matching by Baird <ref> [Bai85] </ref>. Grimson has extensively studied tree search [Gri90a, Gri90c, Gri90b] and shown that for 2D-rigid matching with a stopping criterion, the average-case computational complexity of tree search is O (n 2 ), where n is the number of model features times the number of data features.

Reference-contexts: Sitarman and Rosenfeld [SR89] have theorized that there is some `optimum' size for key-features, but how best to select and detect key-features remains an open question. Pose Space Search Generalized Hough transform <ref> [DY80, Bal81, Dav82] </ref> and pose clustering [Sto87] algorithms shift search from correspondence space and into pose space. Illingworth and Kittler [IK88] review generalized Hough work through 1988. Explicit representations of pose space place practical limits on the dimensionality of the pose space and most algorithms match 2D rigid objects.

Reference-contexts: Geometric Hashing Geometric hashing uses local geometric features and a precompiled hash table to predict object identity and placement. Key-feature Search An early example of the key feature approach is the `local feature focus' method proposed by Bolles and Cain <ref> [BC82] </ref>. David Lowe [Low80, LB83, Low85] extended and further motivated this approach. A variety of key-feature algorithms have used either straight line or local curvature properties to identify object silhouettes [AF86, KJ86, GTM89, AD90].

Reference-contexts: However, this estimate may be imprecise and may significantly alter the 2D appearance of the object as will be shown in Figures 3 and 9 below. For several years, we have worked on an approach to matching using local search [BWR89, BWR90] which now quantitatively handles 3D perspective <ref> [BR92a, BR92b, Bev92] </ref>. A detailed account of this work may be found in Beveridge's Ph.D. dissertation [Bev93]. Matching is cast as the problem of finding the best correspondence between model and image features subject to a global least-squares fitting constraint.

Reference-contexts: For several years, we have worked on an approach to matching using local search [BWR89, BWR90] which now quantitatively handles 3D perspective [BR92a, BR92b, Bev92]. A detailed account of this work may be found in Beveridge's Ph.D. dissertation <ref> [Bev93] </ref>. Matching is cast as the problem of finding the best correspondence between model and image features subject to a global least-squares fitting constraint. Local search algorithms developed specifically for this task use a generate-and-test strategy to explore the combinatorial space of matches. <p> A point on a model line segment is covered when a point on a data segment projects perpendicularly onto it. Unfortunately, space here does not permit a complete accounting of match error parameterization. The reader is referred to Beveridge's Ph.D. dissertation <ref> [Bev93] </ref> for this level of detail. 3.2 Fitting 2D Projections of 3D Models A 2D projection of a 3D model may be fit by minimizing the integrated squared perpendicular distance (ISPD) between data segments and infinitely extended model lines. <p> The resulting equation is second order [BWR90] with coefficients defined in terms of the endpoints of model and image line segments. Interestingly, the case of fixed scale fitting is still closed-form but quartic rather than quadratic [BWR89]. These fitting equations are fully developed in Beveridge's Ph.D. dissertation <ref> [Bev93] </ref> along with two additional improvements: 1) a regularization term which extends the number of cases for which there exists a unique best-fit solution, and 2) a state-vector formulation which facilitates efficient fitting of matches differing slightly from a current match. 3.3 Fitting Under 3D Perspective: Pose Determination Kumar [KH89] observes <p> This expedites the testing of alternative matches during local search. These three enhancements are more fully described in Beveridge's Ph.D. dissertation <ref> [Bev93] </ref>. 3.4 Hallway Navigation ATest Domain Problems requiring that perspective be taken into account arise in the context of landmark-based robot navigation. For example, a robot moving through a hallway will experience dramatic perspective effects associated with even modest movements. This is illustrated in Figure 3. <p> On the other hand, if the match is globally poor, then subsets of the match are probably incompatible. The subset-convergent algorithm has been shown in some cases to dramatically increase the probability of finding the optimal match on a single trial <ref> [BWR90, Bev93] </ref>. In keeping with all our past work, search is initiated from only four preselected subsets. These subsets are selected using an automated heuristic procedure which selects pairs of model segments which are long and come close to meeting at a common point. <p> In the experiments which follow, the pairs of segments (A; D); (B; C); (F; I) and (E; J) as labeled in Figure 5 are the subsets used by the hybrid-subset algorithm. A fuller description of the subset-convergent control strategy for local search appears in Beveridge's Ph.D. dissertation <ref> [Bev93] </ref>. 3.8 Experiment 1: Recovering from Modest Pose Errors. Each of the algorithms introduced above is tested on the task of recovering the true pose of our robot, pose 5, from each of the estimates shown in Figure 3a.
