Reference-contexts: Hutchinson [14], and the existence of a unique compact invariant set was proven. These studies have provided powerful tools for the investigation of fractal sets, and the action of systems of contractive maps to produce fractal sets has been considered by numerous authors (see for example <ref> [2, 3, 8, 12] </ref>). A major challenge of both theoretical and practical interest is the resolution of the so called inverse problem [20, 26, 25, 4]. An exact solution can be found in some particular cases, but in general, no exact solution is known.

Reference-contexts: A lot of work has been done in this framework, and some solutions exist, based on deterministic or stochastic optimization methods. Most of them make some a priori restrictive hypotheses : affine IFS, with a fixed number of functions <ref> [5, 15, 9, 27, 17] </ref>. Solutions based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) or Evolutionary Algorithms have recently been presented for affine IFS [25, 10, 24, 21].

Reference-contexts: A distance image is the transformation of a black & white image into a grey-level one, where the level affected to each image point is a function of its distance to the original shape. It can be easily computed by a simple algorithm (see <ref> [6] </ref>), based on the use of two masks (see figure 8) : the resulting images are parameterized by d1 and d2 which represent the two elementary distances on vertical/horizontal and diagonal directions. This parameterization allows to use distances which are more or less "abrupt".

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction IFS (Iterated Functions System) theory is an important topic in fractals. The geometric and measure theoretical aspects of systems of contractive maps (and associated probabilities) were worked out by J. Hutchinson <ref> [14] </ref>, and the existence of a unique compact invariant set was proven. These studies have provided powerful tools for the investigation of fractal sets, and the action of systems of contractive maps to produce fractal sets has been considered by numerous authors (see for example [2, 3, 8, 12]).

Reference-contexts: This computation time is similar to computation times of GA applied to the inverse problem for affine IFS <ref> [18] </ref>, although in the case of mixed IFS the size of the search space is much more larger. This fact may be explained by the use of variable sized structures in the GP algorithm, which seems to perform a more efficient search in a large space.

Reference-contexts: This allows to consider "smoother" functions to be optimized, as in <ref> [19] </ref>. A distance image is the transformation of a black & white image into a grey-level one, where the level affected to each image point is a function of its distance to the original shape.
