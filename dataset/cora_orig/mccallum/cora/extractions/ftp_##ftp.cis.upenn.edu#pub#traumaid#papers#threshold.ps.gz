Title: Decision Making with Multiple Goals: Extending the Threshold Approach

Abstract: Given a set of conditions that may be present in a patient, this paper presents a method for choosing the optimal combination of treatment actions, taking into account interactions among the available therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. The multiple-threshold approach is an extension of the threshold approach for individual conditions, and it offers a precise way of computing the optimal actions. In addition, tests for an example case show a 11-29% increase in the expected utility of treatments using this method.

Reference-contexts: The intersection of two functions may be nonlin ear, but the property holds in any case. * Following from that, if a function f i &gt;= f j at each of the vertices of the hypercube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n , then f i &gt;= f j at all points within the hypercube. In fact this is true for any hypercube in &lt; n . The last property allows formulas that are provably worse than others to be eliminated efficiently. <p> In fact this is true for any hypercube in &lt; n . The last property allows formulas that are provably worse than others to be eliminated efficiently. Given the set of formulas, there can be a large number generated that are provably worse than others over the probability space <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n (the set of all legal probability values for each condition). Empirically we have eliminated 50-60% of the candidate formulas using this property. <p> This is a result of the sharing of the test costs. Table 1 contains the results for all of the cases. The overall utility of a method was determined by numerical integration over the <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n space. The two methods considered were the multiple-threshold approach and the threshold approach applied to each of the conditions individually. As can be seen from the table, the more interaction present in the case, the greater the gain from the multiple-threshold approach.
