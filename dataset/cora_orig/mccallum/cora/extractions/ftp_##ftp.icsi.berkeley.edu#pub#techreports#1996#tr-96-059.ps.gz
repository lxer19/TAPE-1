Abstract: We study dense cases of several covering problems. An instance of the set cover problem with m sets is dense if there is * &gt; 0 such that any element belongs to at least *m sets. We show that the dense set cover problem can be approximated with the performance ratio c log n for any c &gt; 0 and it is unlikely to be NP-hard. We construct a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the dense Steiner tree problem in n-vertex graphs, i.e. for the case when each terminal is adjacent to at least *n vertices. We also study the vertex cover problem in *-dense graphs. Though this problem is shown to be still MAX-SNP-hard as in general graphs, we find a better approximation algorithm with the performance ratio 2 fl Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, and the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley.

Reference-contexts: The Set Cover Problem (SCP) asks for a minimum size sub-family M of P such that X [fpjp 2 M g. The greedy heuristic gives 1 + lnk approximation for SCP <ref> [5] </ref>. Moreover, SCP cannot be approximated to within less than ln k-factor unless N P DT IM E [n loglogn ] [6]. The B-sparse SCP has a constant upper bound B &gt; 1 on the number of sets in P which cover the same element of X.

The B-sparse SCP has a constant upper bound B &gt; 1 on the number of sets in P which cover the same element of X. The Vertex Cover Problem is a well-known representative of B-sparse SCP (B=2).

Reference-contexts: The Steiner Tree Problem (STP) asks for a minimum size tree within G which spans all terminals from S. Further, d (F ) denotes the length of a graph F , jSj = k and jV j = n. A well-known minimum spanning tree heuristic (MSTH) <ref> [9] </ref> finds a minimum spanning tree M of a weighted complete graph G 0 = (S; E 0 ; c), where the weight of any edge equals to the length of the shortest path between its ends in G. <p> Using MSTH we can find an optimal Steiner tree if we add all Steiner points to the terminal set. Remark 1 An optimal Steiner tree can be found exactly in O (n k ) time. MSTH gives 2-approximation for STP <ref> [9] </ref> and the best up-today polynomial-time approximation guarantee is about 1.644 [7]. From the other side, STP is known to be MAX SNP complete [4]. In the B-sparse STP the degree of any vertex is bounded by a constant B.

Reference-contexts: If the number of terminals is small enough, i.e. k 1 * , then we can find an exact solution in polynomial time. Otherwise, we apply to the dense STP the following variant of Rayward-Smith heuristic (or the greedy algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>).
