Title: Automatic Insertion of Accents in French Text

Abstract: Automatic accent insertion (AAI ) is the problem of re-inserting accents (diacritics) into a text where they are missing. Unaccented French texts are still quite common in electronic media, as a result of a long history of character encoding problems and the lack of well-established conventions for typing accented characters on computer keyboards. We present an AAI method for French, based on a stochastic language model. This method was implemented into a program and C library of functions, which are now commercially available. Our experiments show that French text processed with this program contains less than one accent error per 130 words. We also show how our AAI method can be used to do on-the-fly accent insertions within a word-processing environment, which makes it possible to write in French without having to type accents. A prototype of such a system was integrated into the Emacs editor, and is now available to all students and employees of the Universite de Montreal's computer science department.

Reference-contexts: The parameters of the HMM were first estimated by direct frequency counts on a 60 000 words, hand-tagged extract of the Canadian Hansard. The parameters were then refined, using Baum-Welch reesti-mation <ref> (Baum, 1972) </ref>, on a 3 million word (untagged) corpus consisting of equal parts of Hansards, Cana-dian National Defense documents and French press revues (Radio-France International ). 2.4 Performance Evaluation One of the interesting properties of the AAI problem is that the performance assessment of a given program is a very straightforward

Reference-contexts: However, there exists an algorithm that computes the value of P (w) in polynomial time <ref> (Rabiner and Juang, 1986) </ref>. To find the sequence of hypotheses that maximizes the probability of the text, each individual combination of hypotheses is examined.
