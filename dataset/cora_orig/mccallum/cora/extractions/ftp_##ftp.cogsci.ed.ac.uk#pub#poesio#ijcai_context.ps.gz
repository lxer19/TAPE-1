Abstract: We present a model of context that tries to reconcile in a general and systematic fashion the differences between the discourse models used for reference resolution, conversation act recognition, and dialogue management in a system dealing with conversations. Starting from the technical solutions adopted in DRT, we show first of all how to obtain a discourse model that while preserving DRT's basic ideas about referential accessibility, includes information about the occurrence of speech acts and their relations. We show then how the information about speech acts can be used to formalize the basic ideas of Grosz and Sidner's model of discourse structure. Finally, we extend this model to in corporate an account of the grounding process.

The TRAINS prototype must perform at least three kinds of linguistic activities that depend on a context: reference resolution, conversation action recognition and dialogue management. <p> Illocutionary act recognition algorithms based on those discussed in [ Allen and Perrault, 1980; Hinkel-man, 1990; Traum and Hinkelman, 1992 ] have been developed in the TRAINS System <ref> [ Allen et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Following the implemented system, we adopt here the multi-stratal `Conversation Acts' theory, presented in [ Traum and Hinkelman, 1992 ] .

Reference-contexts: In the case of the TRAINS conversations, for example, the described situation is typically a TRAINS domain plan that the two participants are elaborating, whereas the discourse situation consists of information about what has been happening during the conversation itself. 3 See <ref> [ Asher, 1986; Kamp, 1990 ] </ref> for examples of work in which this latter concern is addressed. As we still want to be able to handle reference problems, we would like to preserve as much of DRT as possible and simply reinterpret what the DRT representation we are constructing says.

Reference-contexts: The collaborative process of adding to the common ground (called grounding) must include installments by each of the conversants. These installments may be explicit |after the first utterance 10 Most work on reference resolution makes the further assumption that felicitous reference requires mutual knowledge <ref> [ Clark and Marshall, 1981 ] </ref> . of (5), B may have acknowledged by uttering something like okay or right|or tacit |the second utterance in (5) can be interpreted as providing a tacit acknowledgment of the first utterance, while at the same time performing additional conversation acts.

Reference-contexts: DRT (and almost all previous work in the reference resolution, discourse structure, and speech acts traditions) makes use of the assumption that everything that is uttered immediately becomes a part of the common ground and, hence, is available for reference. 10 As shown, e.g., in <ref> [ Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Clark and Schaefer, 1989 ] </ref> , however, this assumption is simply an idealization.

Reference-contexts: This interpretation is often unproblematic, but in conversations the speakers may be talking about situations distinct from the one that includes the discourse situation. In the TRAINS conversations, 4 for example, assertions such as those in (5) might not be describing 4 Transcribed in <ref> [ Gross et al., 1993 ] </ref> . the state of the world which A and B are currently in, but, rather, a possible state of the world in the future, resulting from a few steps of the plan that A and B are trying to agree upon. <p> A fairly minor augmentation is the addition of a new relation, ga, which holds between a locutionary act and a grounding act if the grounding act has been generated by the perfor 11 Taken from Dialog d91-6.1 in <ref> [ Gross et al., 1993 ] </ref> . mance of the locutionary act.

Reference-contexts: This difference in emphasis has resulted in conceptual differences between the models of context proposed within the two traditions. For example, ever since Grosz's dissertation <ref> [ Grosz, 1977 ] </ref> it has been known that subordination relations between discourse goals affect the structure of global focus, hence the `pragmatic' accessibility of referents. A model of context that contains information about the intentions of the conversational participants is therefore advantageous for reference resolution purposes.
