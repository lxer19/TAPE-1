Abstract: This paper presents a new model reference adaptive control method to control motor torque in direct drive reluctance motors in an accurate and ripple-free fashion. It is based on the motor's voltage equation and requires only measurements of motor angle, winding voltages and currents. In addition, we introduce a new optimal torque-to-current conversion which minimizes copper losses. Simulations of a reluctance motor with magnetically coupled phases demonstrate fast parameter convergence and accurate torque tracking.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Direct drive robots whose joints are directly actuated by electro-mechanical motors without transmissions permit, in principle, precise and high-performance model based control <ref> [1] </ref>. However, due to non-sinusoidally distributed windings, which are the consequence of a high number of poles, and to the saliency of the air gap due to armature slots, in practice the generation of smooth torque is a major challenge in direct drive motor control. <p> The true parameters of the motor and the major harmonics are chosen based on experimental results with the McGill/MIT motor [5]. We included the five main harmonics, namely - = <ref> [1; 3; 6; 12; 24] </ref> T , resulting in 10 parameters to be identified. In addition the method requires the identification of two more parameters R s and L 0 s , termed "Resistance" and "Inductance" in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Sepe [8] implemented an adaptive method to control the speed of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The parameters of the combined mechanical and electrical system were unknown. To make the problem tractable, the motor model was idealized, without cogging or torque ripples, and a simple mechanical load was considered. Chen <ref> [2] </ref> developed adaptive linearization for position control of a step motor. However it depends on a simple mechanical load and torque measurement. Shouse and Taylor [9] applied a self-tuning tracking controller for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor when both the electrical and mechanical parameters are unknown. <p> It is interesting to note that in the case of no harmonics (ideal motor) where a = 0, we obtain i qr = i ds = 0 and i dr = i qs = i fl , which coincide with the conventional torque-current translation <ref> [6, 7, 4, 2] </ref>. 3.2 Online parameter estimation It has been shown that the optimal current is i r = Ii s , where I = 0 1 Substituting i r into (6) and (1) yields the electrical dynamics of the stator.

Reference-contexts: Second, each motor requires its own "finger-print" calibration which has to be done periodically if accuracy is to be maintained and certainly after each disassembly of the system. For this reason, online schemes have been investigated, which continuously estimate the motor model for purposes of accurate torque control.
