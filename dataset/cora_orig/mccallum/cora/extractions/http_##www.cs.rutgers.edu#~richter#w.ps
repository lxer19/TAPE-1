Abstract: A family of explicit space-time finite element methods for the initial boundary value problem for linear, symmetric hyperbolic systems of equations is described and analyzed. The method generalizes the discontinuous Galerkin method, and as is typical for this method, error estimates of order O(h n+1=2 ) are obtained for approximations by polynomials of degree n. 1. Introduction. In this paper we consider the approximate solution of linear, symmetric hyperbolic systems of equations

We divide the space-time domain into a mesh of elements K which are unions of simplices in R N+1 .

These results indicate an optimal O (h 2 ) rate of convergence, in contrast to our theoretical estimate of O (h 1:5 ). This h gap between theoretical and actual convergence rates is typical for the discontinuous Galerkin method (cf. [10] and [11]).
