Reference-contexts: This paper serves as an introduction to WDM device issues. No background in optics or advanced physics is needed. For a more advanced and/or detailed discussion of WDM devices, we refer the interested reader to <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. This paper presents an overview of optical fiber and devices such as couplers, optical transmitters, optical receivers and filters, optical amplifiers, optical routers, and switches. <p> Then, we will discuss various implementations of tunable lasers and their properties. Good references on tunable laser technology include <ref> [1] </ref> [3] [15]. 3.1 How a Laser Works The word laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The key words are stimulated emission, which is what allows a laser to produce intense high-powered beams of coherent light (light which contains one or more distinct frequencies). <p> We observe that there is a tradeoff between the tuning range of a transmitter and its tuning time. 4 Optical Receivers and Filters Tunable optical filter technology is a key in making WDM networks realizable. Good sources of information on these devices include <ref> [1] </ref> [3] [22]. 4.1 Photodetectors In receivers employing direct detection, a photodetector converts the incoming photonic stream into a stream of electrons. The electron stream is then amplified and passed through a threshold device. <p> The feasibility of many local WDM networks is dependent upon the speed and range of tunable filters. Overviews of tunable filter technology can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> and [3]. 4.2.1 Filter Characteristics Tunable optical filters are characterized primarily by their tuning range and tuning time. The tuning range specifies the range of wavelengths which can be accessed by a filter. A wide tuning range allows systems to utilize a greater number of channels. <p> With a low finesse, the channels would need to be spaced further apart to avoid crosstalk, resulting in fewer channels. One approach to increasing the number of channels is to 16 17 cascade filters with different FSRs <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 13 shows the filter passbands for a high-resolution filter and a low-resolution filter, each with four channels within a FSR. By cascading these filters, up to 16 unique channels may be resolved. 4.2.2 The Etalon The etalon consists of a single cavity formed by two parallel mirrors. <p> because it can be fabricated on semiconductor material, its tuning time is still on the order of milliseconds, and its tuning control is complex, requiring that the setting of the delay element in each stage of the MZ chain be based on the settings in previous stages of the chain <ref> [1] </ref>. The high tuning time is due to thermal elements used in implementing the delay elements. <p> The sound waves change the crystal's index of refraction, which enables the crystal to act as a grating. Light incident upon the transducer will diffract at an angle that depends on the angle of incidence and the wavelength of the light <ref> [1] </ref>. By changing the RF waves, a single optical wavelength can be chosen to pass through the material while the rest of the wavelengths destructively interfere. The tuning time of the acoustooptic filter is limited by the flight time of the surface acoustic wave to about 10 s [3] [26]. <p> Electrodes, which rest in the crystal, are used to supply current to the crystal. The current changes the crystal's index of refraction, which allows some wavelengths to pass through while others destructively interfere <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Some of the losses may be countered through the use of optical amplifiers, and an important consideration in designing a WDM network is the design and appropriate placement of amplifiers. There are three main applications for optical amplifiers in a lightwave network <ref> [1] </ref>. The first application is as a transmitter power booster, which is placed immediately after the transmitter in order to provide a high power signal to the network. This allows the signal to undergo splitting at couplers or to travel longer distances.

The key words are stimulated emission, which is what allows a laser to produce intense high-powered beams of coherent light (light which contains one or more distinct frequencies). <p> This approach to tuning results in a tuning range that encompasses the entire useful gain spectrum of the semiconductor laser <ref> [3] </ref>, but tuning time is limited to the order of milliseconds due to the mechanical nature of the tuning and the length of the cavity. 13 The length of the cavity may also limit transmission rates unless an external modulator is used. <p> Neither of these approaches allow continuous tuning over a range of wavelengths. The tuning range is limited by the range of frequencies generated by the laser (the laser's gain spectrum) and the range of wavelengths resolvable by the filter <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2.4 Injection-Current-Tuned Lasers Injection-current-tuned lasers form a family of transmitters which allow wavelength selection via a diffraction grating. The Distributed Feedback (DFB) laser uses a diffraction grating placed in the lasing medium. <p> If the grating is moved to the outside of the lasing medium, the laser is called a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser. The tuning in a DBR laser is discrete rather than continuous, and tuning times of less than 10 ns have been measured <ref> [3] </ref>. In [17], a tuning time of 0.5 ns is reported for a DBR laser with a tuning range of 4 nm, which is capable of supporting eight wavelengths. <p> We observe that there is a tradeoff between the tuning range of a transmitter and its tuning time. 4 Optical Receivers and Filters Tunable optical filter technology is a key in making WDM networks realizable. Good sources of information on these devices include [1] <ref> [3] </ref> [22]. 4.1 Photodetectors In receivers employing direct detection, a photodetector converts the incoming photonic stream into a stream of electrons. The electron stream is then amplified and passed through a threshold device. <p> The feasibility of many local WDM networks is dependent upon the speed and range of tunable filters. Overviews of tunable filter technology can be found in [1] and <ref> [3] </ref>. 4.2.1 Filter Characteristics Tunable optical filters are characterized primarily by their tuning range and tuning time. The tuning range specifies the range of wavelengths which can be accessed by a filter. A wide tuning range allows systems to utilize a greater number of channels. <p> The distance between the mirrors may be adjusted mechanically by physically moving the mirrors, or may be adjusted by changing the index of the material within the cavity. Many modifications (e.g., multi-cavity and multi-pass) to the etalon can be made to improve the number of resolvable channels <ref> [3] </ref>. In a multi-pass filter, the light passes through the same cavity multiple times, while in a multi-cavity filter, multiple etalons of different FSRs are cascaded to effectively increase the finesse. An example of a mechanically-tuned etalon is the Fabry-Perot filter. <p> By changing the RF waves, a single optical wavelength can be chosen to pass through the material while the rest of the wavelengths destructively interfere. The tuning time of the acoustooptic filter is limited by the flight time of the surface acoustic wave to about 10 s <ref> [3] </ref> [26]. However, the tuning range for acoustooptic filters covers the entire 1300 nm to 1560 nm spectrum [3]. This tuning range may potentially allow about 100 channels. If more than one RF wave is passed through the grating simultaneously, more than one wavelength can be filtered out [27]. <p> The tuning time of the acoustooptic filter is limited by the flight time of the surface acoustic wave to about 10 s <ref> [3] </ref> [26]. However, the tuning range for acoustooptic filters covers the entire 1300 nm to 1560 nm spectrum [3]. This tuning range may potentially allow about 100 channels. If more than one RF wave is passed through the grating simultaneously, more than one wavelength can be filtered out [27]. This allows the filter to be effectively tuned to several channels at the same time. <p> Since the tuning time is limited only by the speed of electronics, tuning time can be on the order of several nanoseconds, but the tuning range (and thus, the number of resolvable channels) remains quite small at 16 nm (on the order of 10 channels) <ref> [3] </ref>. 4.2.6 Liquid-Crystal Fabry-Perot Filters Liquid-crystal filters appear to be a promising new filter technology. The design of a liquid-crystal filter is similar to the design of a Fabry-Perot filter, but the cavity consists of a liquid crystal (LC). <p> Using the identity f = 2 the frequency needed for BW T is f = 2 where is the center wavelength. If we want each channel to have a bit rate of B Gbps, 2B GHz of bandwidth will be needed for encoding. According to <ref> [3] </ref>, a channel spacing of at least 6 times the channel bit rate is needed to minimize crosstalk on a WDM system.

Reference-contexts: Single-mode fiber usually has a core size of about 10 m, while multimode fiber typically has a core size of 50-100 m (see Fig. 4). A step-index fiber will support a single mode if V in Equation (4) is less than 2.4048 <ref> [7] </ref>. Thus, single-mode fiber eliminates intermodal dispersion, and can, hence, support transmission over much longer distances. However, it introduces the problem of concentrating enough power into a very small core. LEDs cannot couple enough light into a single-mode fiber to facilitate long distance communications.

Reference-contexts: Luckily, this is also a low-attenuation window (although loss is lower at 1550 nm). Through advanced techniques such as dispersion shifting, fibers with zero dispersion at a wavelength between 1300 nm and 1700 nm can be manufactured <ref> [8] </ref>. In a dispersion-shifted fiber, the core and cladding are designed such that the waveguide dispersion is negative with respect to the material dispersion, thus canceling the total dispersion. <p> The most common splitter is a 1fi2 splitter, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). The splitting ratio, ff, is the amount of power that goes to each output. For a two-port splitter, the most common splitting ratio is 50:50, though splitters with any ratio can be manufactured <ref> [8] </ref>. Combiners (see Fig. 8 (b)) are the reverse of splitters, and when turned around, a combiner can be used as a splitter. An input signal to the combiner suffers a power loss of about 3 dB.

Reference-contexts: a WDM system, these effects place constraints on the spacing between adjacent wavelength channels, limit the maximum power on any channel, and may also limit the maximum bit rate. 2.5.1 Nonlinear Refraction In optical fiber, the index of refraction depends on the optical intensity of signals propagating through the fiber <ref> [9] </ref>. Thus, the phase of the light at the receiver will depend on the phase of the light sent by the transmitter, the length of the fiber, and the optical intensity. <p> 10-channel system with 10 nm channel spacing, the power on each channel should be kept below 3 mW to minimize the effects of SRS. 2.5.3 Stimulated Brillouin Scattering Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) is similar to SRS, except that the frequency shift is cause by sound waves rather than molecular vibrations <ref> [9] </ref>. Other characteristics of SBS are that the Stokes wave propagates in the opposite direction of the input light, and SBS occurs at relatively low input powers for wide pulses (greater than 1 s), but has negligible effect for short pulses (less than 10 ns) [11]. <p> It is shown that, in a WDM system using channels spaced 10 GHz apart and a transmitter power of 0.1 mW per channel, a maximum of about 100 channels can be obtained in the 1550 nm low-attenuation region <ref> [9] </ref>. The details of optical nonlinearities are very complex, and beyond the scope of this article. However, they are a major limiting factor in the available number channels in a WDM system, especially those operating over distances greater than 30 km [9]. <p> can be obtained in the 1550 nm low-attenuation region <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In multiwavelength systems, the shorter-wavelength channels will lose some power to each of the higher-wavelength channels within the Raman gain spectrum. To reduce the amount of loss, the power on each channel needs to be below a certain level. In <ref> [10] </ref>, it is shown that in a 10-channel system with 10 nm channel spacing, the power on each channel should be kept below 3 mW to minimize the effects of SRS. 2.5.3 Stimulated Brillouin Scattering Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) is similar to SRS, except that the frequency shift is cause by

The intensity of the scattered light is much greater in SBS than in SRS, but the frequency range of SBS, on the order of 10 GHz, is much lower than that of SRS. Also, the gain bandwidth of SBS is only on the order of 100 MHz. <p> The existence of these nonlinearities suggests that WDM protocols which limit the number of nodes to the number of channels do not scale well.

A splitter is a coupler that divides the optical signal on one fiber to two or more fibers.

Reference-contexts: These extra signals, called sidebands, can cause interference if they overlap with frequencies used for data transmission. Likewise, mixing can occur between combinations of three or more wavelengths. The effect of FWM in WDM systems can be reduced by using unequally-spaced channels <ref> [12] </ref>. Four-wave mixing can be used to provide wavelength conversion, as will be shown in Section 7. 2.5.5 Summary Nonlinear effects in optical fibers may potentially limit the performance of WDM optical networks.

Reference-contexts: As was mentioned in Section 2.4, the spreading of a pulse due to dispersion will limit the maximum bit rate. Frequency instabilities in lasers are variations in the laser frequency. Three such instabilities are mode hopping, mode shifts, and wavelength chirp <ref> [16] </ref>. Mode hopping occurs primarily in injection-current lasers and is a sudden jump in the laser frequency caused by a change in the injection current above a given threshold. Mode shifts are changes in frequency due to temperature changes. <p> Only wavelengths which match the period and indices of the grating will be constructively reinforced. All other wavelengths will destructively interfere, and will not propagate through the waveguide. The condition for propagation is given by: D = =2n where D is the period of the grating <ref> [16] </ref>. The laser is tuned by injecting a current which changes the index of the grating region. If the grating is moved to the outside of the lasing medium, the laser is called a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser. <p> One of the drawbacks of the DBR laser is that it is susceptible to mode hopping. Typical linewidths for injection current semiconductor lasers range from about 1 MHz to 50 MHz. MQW lasers offer narrower linewidths which can be on the order of hundreds of kHz <ref> [16] </ref>. 3.2.5 Laser Arrays An alternative to tunable lasers is the laser array, which contains a set of fixed-tuned lasers and whose advantage/application is explained below. A laser array consists of a number of lasers which are integrated into a single component, with each laser operating at a different wavelength.

Reference-contexts: In a multi-pass filter, the light passes through the same cavity multiple times, while in a multi-cavity filter, multiple etalons of different FSRs are cascaded to effectively increase the finesse. An example of a mechanically-tuned etalon is the Fabry-Perot filter. In <ref> [23] </ref>, it was found that the maximum number of channels for a single-cavity Fabry-Perot filter is 0.65F, where F is the finesse. A two-pass filter was found to have a maximum of 1.4F channels, and two-cavity filters up to 0:44F 2 channels.

Reference-contexts: This makes it unsuitable for many packet-switched applications in which the packet duration is much smaller than the tuning time.

Like in many practical networks, simplicity has been chosen over "smart" protocols.

Reference-contexts: The high tuning time is due to thermal elements used in implementing the delay elements. Recent advances have produced a very fast (approx. 100 ns) tuning MZ filter, but the number of channels is limited (to 8) and the insertion loss is high <ref> [25] </ref>. 18 4.2.4 Acoustooptic Filters A fast tuning time is obtained when acoustooptic filters are used. Radio frequency (RF) waves are passed through a transducer. The transducer is a piezoelectric crystal that converts sound waves to mechanical movement.

Reference-contexts: By changing the RF waves, a single optical wavelength can be chosen to pass through the material while the rest of the wavelengths destructively interfere. The tuning time of the acoustooptic filter is limited by the flight time of the surface acoustic wave to about 10 s [3] <ref> [26] </ref>. However, the tuning range for acoustooptic filters covers the entire 1300 nm to 1560 nm spectrum [3]. This tuning range may potentially allow about 100 channels. If more than one RF wave is passed through the grating simultaneously, more than one wavelength can be filtered out [27]. <p> The selection of up to five wavelengths was reported in [27]. One manufacturer has introduced an acoustooptic filter [28] which has an 80 nm tuning range, 10 s tuning time, and the ability to simultaneously select up to 10 wavelengths <ref> [26] </ref>. One drawback of acoustooptic filters is that, because of their wide transfer function, they are unable to filter out crosstalk from adjacent channels if the channels are closely spaced.

Reference-contexts: The refractive index of the LC is modulated by an electrical current to filter out a desired wavelength, as in an electrooptic filter. Tuning time is on the order of microseconds (sub-microsecond times are expected to be achievable), and tuning range is 30-40 nm <ref> [29] </ref>. These filters have low power requirements and are inexpensive to fabricate. The filter speed of LC filter technology promises to be high enough to handle high-speed packet switching in broadcast-and-select WDM networks. 4.2.7 Summary Table 2 summarizes the state of the art in tunable receivers.

Reference-contexts: Two primary characteristics of a Bragg grating are the reflectivity and the spectral bandwidth. Typical spectral bandwidths are on the order of 0.1 nm, while a reflectivity in excess of 99% is achievable <ref> [30] </ref>. While inducing a grating directly into the core of a fiber leads to low insertion loss, a drawback of Bragg gratings is that the refractive index in the grating varies with temperature, with increases in temperature resulting in longer wavelengths being reflected.

Reference-contexts: Thin-film filter technology suffers from poor thermal stability, high insertion loss, and poor spectral profile. However, advances have been made which address some of these issues <ref> [32] </ref>. 20 5 Optical Amplifiers Although an optical signal can propagate a long distance before it needs amplification, both long-haul and local lightwave networks can benefit from optical amplifiers.

Reference-contexts: Optical amplification uses the principle of stimulated emission, similar to the approach used in a laser. The two basic type of optical amplifiers are semiconductor laser amplifiers and rare-earth-doped-fiber amplifiers, which will be discussed in the following sections. A general overview of optical amplifiers can be found in <ref> [33] </ref>. 5.1 Optical Amplifier Characteristics Some basic parameters of interest in an optical amplifier are gain, gain bandwidth, gain saturation, polarization sensitivity, and amplifier noise. Gain measures the ratio of the output power of a signal to its input power. <p> The primary difference between the two is in the reflectivity of the end mirrors. Fabry-Perot amplifiers have a reflectivity of around 30%, while TWAs have a reflectivity of around 0.01% <ref> [33] </ref>. In order to prevent lasing in the Fabry-Perot amplifier, the bias current is operated below the lasing threshold current. The higher reflections in the Fabry-Perot amplifier cause Fabry-Perot resonances in the amplifier, resulting in narrow passbands of around 5 GHz. <p> Thus, TWAs are more appropriate than Fabry-Perot amplifiers for WDM networks. Today's semiconductor amplifiers can achieve gains of 25 dB with a gain saturation of 10 dBm, polarization sensitivity of 1 dB, and bandwidth range of 40 nm <ref> [33] </ref>. Semiconductor amplifiers based on multiple quantum wells (MQW) are currently being studied. These amplifiers have higher bandwidth and higher gain saturation than bulk devices. They also provide faster on-off switching times. The disadvantage is a higher polarization sensitivity. <p> The 3-dB gain bandwidth for the EDFA is around 35 nm (see Fig. 17), and the gain saturation power is around 10 dBm <ref> [33] </ref>. For the 1300 nm region, the praseodymium-doped fluoride fiber amplifier (PDFFA) has recently been receiving attention. These amplifiers have low cross-talk and noise characteristics, while attaining high gains. They are able to operate over a range of around 50 nm in the 1280 nm to 1330 nm range.

Reference-contexts: Experimentally, EDFAs have been shown to achieve gains of up to 51 dB with the maximum gain limited by internal Rayleigh backscattering in which some of the light energy of the signal is scattered in the fiber and directed back towards the signal source <ref> [34] </ref>. The 3-dB gain bandwidth for the EDFA is around 35 nm (see Fig. 17), and the gain saturation power is around 10 dBm [33]. For the 1300 nm region, the praseodymium-doped fluoride fiber amplifier (PDFFA) has recently been receiving attention.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a multiwavelength optical signal passing through a series of amplifiers will eventually result in the power of the wavelengths being uneven. A number of approaches to equalizing the gain of an EDFA have been studied. In <ref> [38] </ref>, a notch filter (a filter which attenuates the signal at a selected frequency) centered at around 1530 nm is used to suppress the peak in the EDFA gain (see Fig. 17). However, when multiple EDFAs are cascaded, another peak appears around the 1560 nm wavelength.

Reference-contexts: For this class of devices, at least some of the components within an entire system must be able to change states or switch as fast as or faster than the signal bit rate <ref> [42] </ref>. This ability gives the device some added flexibility but limits the maximum bit rate that can be accommodated. Thus, relational devices are needed for circuit switching, and logic devices are needed for packet switching. <p> Space-division optical-routing switches may be built from 2fi2 optical crosspoint elements [54] arranged in a banyan-based fabric. The space division switches (which may be one per wavelength [55]) can route a signal from any input to any output on a given wavelength. Such switches based on relational devices <ref> [42] </ref> are capable of switching very high-capacity signals. The 2fi2 crosspoint elements that are used to build the space-division switches may be slowly tunable and they may be reconfigured to adapt to changing traffic requirements. Switches of this type can be constructed from off-the-shelf components available today.

Reference-contexts: In the bar state, the signal from the upper input port is routed to the upper output port, and the signal from the lower input port is routed to the lower output port. Optical crosspoint elements have been demonstrated using two types of technologies: (a) the generic directive switch <ref> [43] </ref>, in which light via some structure is physically directed to one of two different outputs, and (b) the gate switch, in which optical amplifier gates are used to select and filter input signals to specific output ports. 6.1.1 Directive Switches The directional coupler (see Fig. 19 (a) [43]) consists of <p> directive switch <ref> [43] </ref>, in which light via some structure is physically directed to one of two different outputs, and (b) the gate switch, in which optical amplifier gates are used to select and filter input signals to specific output ports. 6.1.1 Directive Switches The directional coupler (see Fig. 19 (a) [43]) consists of a pair of optical channel waveguides that are parallel and in close proximity over some finite interaction length. Light input to one of the waveguides couples to the second waveguide via evanescent 5 coupling. <p> In this device, the electrode is split into at least two sections. The cross state is achieved by applying equal and opposite voltages to the two electrodes. This approach has been shown to be very successful <ref> [43] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Other types of switches include the mechanical fiber-optic switch and the thermo-optic switch.

Reference-contexts: The switched signals are then directed to multiplexers which are associated with the output ports. Finally, information from multiple WDM channels are multiplexed before launching them back onto an output fiber.

Reference-contexts: A number of switch architectures which use delay lines to implement optical buffering have been proposed <ref> [56] </ref> [57] [58] [59], and a sampling of these approaches will be reviewed below. A delay line is simply a long length of fiber which introduces propagation delays that are on the order of packet transmission times. <p> A review of photonic packet switches is given in [60]. 6.4.1 The Staggering Switch The staggering switch, which is an "almost-all-optical" packet switch has been proposed in <ref> [56] </ref>. In an "almost-all-optical" network, the data path is fully optical, but the control of the switching operation is performed electronically. <p> The staggering switch architecture is based on an output-collision-resolution scheme that is controlled by a set of delay lines with unequal delays. The architecture is based on two rearrangeably nonblocking stages interconnected by optical delay lines with different amounts of delay. The work in <ref> [56] </ref> investigates the probability of packet loss and the switch latency as a function of link utilization and switch size. In general, with proper setting of the number of delay lines, the switch can achieve an arbitrary low probability of packet loss.

Reference-contexts: To establish a lightpath, we require that the same wavelength be allocated on all the links in the path. This requirement is known as the wavelength-continuity constraint (e.g., see <ref> [61] </ref>). This constraint distinguishes the wavelength-routed network from a circuit-switched network which blocks calls only when there is no capacity along any of the links in the path assigned to the call. Consider the example in Fig. 28 (a).

Reference-contexts: An ideal wavelength converter should possess the following characteristics <ref> [62] </ref>: * transparency to bit rates and signal formats, 34 * fast setup time of output wavelength, * conversion to both shorter and longer wavelengths, * moderate input power levels, * possibility for same input and output wavelengths (i.e., no conversion), * insensitivity to input signal polarization, * low-chirp output signal <p> same input and output wavelengths (i.e., no conversion), * insensitivity to input signal polarization, * low-chirp output signal with high extinction ratio 7 and large signal-to-noise ratio, and * simple implementation. 7.1 Wavelength Conversion Technologies Several researchers have attempted to classify and compare the several techniques available for wavelength conversion <ref> [62] </ref> [63] [64] [65] [66]. The classification of these techniques presented in this section follows that in [65]. <p> This method has been demonstrated for bit rates up to 10 Gbps [66]. However, this method is much more complex and consumes a lot more power than the other methods described below <ref> [62] </ref>. Moreover, the process of opto-electronic (O/E) conversion adversely affects the transparency of the signal, requiring the optical data to be in a specified modulation format and at a specific bit rate. <p> These techniques belong to a class known as optical-gating wavelength conversion [66]. 36 * Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA) in XGM and XPM mode: The principle behind using an SOA in the cross-gain modulation (XGM) mode is shown in Fig. 32 (from <ref> [62] </ref>). The intensity-modulated input signal modulates the gain in the SOA due to gain saturation. A continuous-wave (CW) signal at the desired output wavelength ( c ) is modulated by the gain variation so that it carries the same information as the original input signal. <p> The XGM scheme gives a wavelength-converted signal that is inverted compared to the input signal. While the XGM scheme is simple to realize and offers penalty-free conversion at 10 Gbps <ref> [62] </ref>, it suffers from the drawbacks due to inversion of the converted bit stream and extinction ratio degradation for the converted signal. <p> An incoming signal that depletes the carrier density will modulate the refractive index and thereby result in phase modulation of a CW signal (wavelength c ) coupled into the converter <ref> [62, 75] </ref>. The SOA can be integrated into an interferometer so that an intensity-modulated signal format results at the output of the converter. Techniques involving SOAs in XPM mode have been proposed using nonlinear optical loop mirrors (NOLMs) [76], Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) [77] and Michelson interferometers (MI) [78]. <p> Techniques involving SOAs in XPM mode have been proposed using nonlinear optical loop mirrors (NOLMs) [76], Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) [77] and Michelson interferometers (MI) [78]. Figure 33 shows an asymmetric MZI wavelength converter based on SOA in XPM mode (from <ref> [62] </ref>). With the XPM scheme, the converted output signal can be either inverted or non-inverted, unlike in the XGM scheme where the output is always inverted. The XPM scheme is also very power efficient compared to the XGM scheme [62]. * Semiconductor Lasers: Using single-mode semiconductor lasers, lasing mode intensity is <p> asymmetric MZI wavelength converter based on SOA in XPM mode (from <ref> [62] </ref>). With the XPM scheme, the converted output signal can be either inverted or non-inverted, unlike in the XGM scheme where the output is always inverted. The XPM scheme is also very power efficient compared to the XGM scheme [62]. * Semiconductor Lasers: Using single-mode semiconductor lasers, lasing mode intensity is modulated by input signal light through lasing mode gain saturation. The obtained output (converted) signal is inverted compared to the input signal. <p> Moreover, deploying multiple opto-electronic converters in a WDM cross-connect, e.g., in a WRS, requires sophisticated packaging to avoid crosstalk among channels. This leads to increased cost per converter, further making this technology less attractive than all-optical converters [66]. Other disadvantages of opto-electronic converters include complexity and large power consumption <ref> [62] </ref>. Among all-optical converters, converters based on SOAs using the XGM and the XPM conversion scheme presently seem well suited for system use. Converters based on FWM, though transparent to different modulation formats, perform inefficiently [62]. <p> Other disadvantages of opto-electronic converters include complexity and large power consumption <ref> [62] </ref>.

However, wave-mixing converters are the only category of wavelength converters that offer the full range of transparency while also allowing simultaneous conversion of a set of input wavelengths to another set of output wavelengths. In this respect, DFG-based methods offer great promise.

Figure 33 shows an asymmetric MZI wavelength converter based on SOA in XPM mode (from [62]). With the XPM scheme, the converted output signal can be either inverted or non-inverted, unlike in the XGM scheme where the output is always inverted.

Reference-contexts: A possible architecture of such a wavelength-convertible switching node is the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch (see Fig. 35, from <ref> [81] </ref>). In this architecture, referred to as a wavelength-interchanging cross-connect (WXSC), each wavelength along each output link in a switch has a dedicated wavelength converter (shown as boxes labeled WC in Fig. 35), i.e., an M fi M switch in an N -wavelength system requires M fl N converters. <p> However, the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch is not very cost efficient since all the wavelength converters may not be required all the time [82]. An effective method to cut costs is to share the converters. Two architectures have been proposed for switches sharing converters <ref> [81] </ref>. In the share-per-node structure (see Fig. 36 (a)), all the converters at the switching node are collected in a converter bank. <p> When opto-electronic wavelength conversion is used, the functionality of the wavelength converter can also be performed at the access stations instead of at the switches. The share-with-local switch architecture proposed in <ref> [81] </ref> (see Fig. 37) and the simplified network access station architecture proposed in [83] (see Fig. 38) fall under this category. In the share-with-local switch architecture, selected incoming optical signals are converted to electrical signals by a receiver bank.

Reference-contexts: The third application is as an in-line amplifier, which is used within the network to boost degraded signals for further propagation. Each of these situations requires the amplifier to have different characteristics. A discussion of the requirements and design of multi-stage EDFAs for various applications is given in <ref> [86] </ref>. Table 4 summarizes some of these requirements. For in-line amplifier applications, there is the additional issue of amplifier placement. Amplifiers need to be placed strategically throughout the network in a way which guarantees that all signals are adequately 42 amplified while minimizing the total number of amplifiers being used.

Reference-contexts: Amplifiers need to be placed strategically throughout the network in a way which guarantees that all signals are adequately 42 amplified while minimizing the total number of amplifiers being used. A study of this problem in local access networks is reported in <ref> [87] </ref>. When utilizing cascades of in-line amplifiers, one must also consider issues such as ASE noise introduced by the amplifiers, and the unequal gain spectrum of the amplifiers. The accumulation of ASE noise in a cascade of amplifiers may seriously degrade the SNR.

Reference-contexts: When multiple EDFAs are cascaded, the resulting gain bandwidth may be significantly reduced from the gain bandwidth of a single EDFA. An initial bandwidth of 30 nm can potentially be reduced to less than 10 nm after a cascade of 50 EDFAs <ref> [88] </ref>. Although recent developments in amplifier technology have solved many of the power loss and noise problems in optical networks, network designers should not rely solely on amplifiers for resolving power issues, but should also consider other options.

Reference-contexts: switch or the waveguide grating router, instead of wavelength-independent devices, such as the amplifier gate switch or the passive-star coupler. 8.3 Crosstalk Crosstalk may either be caused by interference from signals on different wavelengths (interband crosstalk), or by interference from signals on the same wavelength on another fiber (intraband crosstalk) <ref> [89] </ref>. Inter-band crosstalk must be considered when determining channel spacing. In some cases, interband crosstalk may be removed through the use of appropriate narrowband filters. Intraband crosstalk usually occurs in switching nodes where multiple signals on the same wavelength are being switched from different inputs to different outputs. <p> The degree of intraband crosstalk depends in part on the switch and node architectures, and one approach for reducing intraband crosstalk is to introduce additional wavelength selective filters within a node <ref> [89] </ref>. 8.4 Additional Considerations Other device considerations in the design of WDM networks include dispersion and architectural issues. As was mentioned in Section 2.4, dispersion in an optical communication system causes a pulse to broaden as it propagates along the fiber.

Reference-contexts: The simplest and most popular interconnection device for a local area WDM network is the passive-star coupler which provides a broadcast medium (see Fig. 39). The broadcast capability of the star coupler combined with multiple WDM channels allows for a wide range of possible media access protocols <ref> [90] </ref> [91]. Also, since the star coupler is a passive device, it is fairly reliable. The drawback of having a passive network medium is that the network nodes may be required to handle additional processing and may require additional hardware in order to route and schedule transmissions. <p> These decisions usually depend on the protocol, degree of access, and connectivity desired in the network. A WDM network protocol may either be a single-hop protocol <ref> [90] </ref>, in which communication takes place directly between two nodes without being routed through intermediate nodes; or a multihop protocol [91], in which information from a source node to a destination node may traverse intermediate nodes in the 44 network. In general, multihop networks require less tuning than single-hop networks. <p> The tunability allows the network to be dynamically reconfigured based on traffic patterns, and it also allows the implementation of single-hop protocols. A number of single-hop WDM protocols based on nodes with tunable transmitters and/or tunable receivers are presented in <ref> [90] </ref>. Additional transmitters and receivers at each node may help to increase the connectivity of the network and may also be used to help coordinate transmissions.

Reference-contexts: This section describes a sampling of experimental WDM testbeds and projects in both the local area and wide-area domains. 9.1 Local Area Network Testbeds Two examples of WDM local area network testbeds are Bellcore's LAMBDANET <ref> [92] </ref> and IBM's Rainbow [24]. Like in many practical networks, simplicity has been chosen over "smart" protocols. <p> The incoming wavelengths are separated using a diffraction-grating wavelength demultiplexer, and each individual wavelength is sent to an optical receiver. Each node's transmitter is fixed on that node's home wavelength. This allows single-hop connectivity without requiring tunable components, as well as not requiring the design of smart protocols. In <ref> [92] </ref>, an aggregate throughput of 36 Gbps was demonstrated for a 16-node system. While the advantages of LAMBDANET include simplicity of design and architectural support for multicasting, we don't consider the architecture scalable, because it requires N data wavelengths. <p> The practicality of requiring N receivers per node is also a limitation, as for systems with large N , the cost per node might become large. However, recent advances in receiver array technology may help reduce the system's cost <ref> [92] </ref>. 9.1.2 Rainbow IBM's Rainbow-I testbed was designed to support up to 32 IBM PS/2's connected via thirty-two 200 Mbps WDM channels (for an aggregate throughput of 6.4 Gbps) [93]. Each node is equipped with a fixed DFB laser transmitter and a tunable Fabry-Perot filter receiver.

Reference-contexts: Though a simple protocol, the setup time may be too long for packet switching. Like LAMBDANET, Rainbow does not scale well.

It consists of similar optical hardware and the same media-access protocol as the Rainbow-I network, but also incorporates some higher-layer protocols.

The purpose of the long distance testbed is to study the transmission of various optical signals over distances of 2000 km. The crossconnect testbed will connect the long distance testbed with the local exchange and will allow researchers to study various crossconnect devices and network management software.
