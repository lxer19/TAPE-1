Title: Global Asymptotic Stability of a Passive Juggler: A Parts Feeding Strategy  
Author: P. J. Swanson, R. R. Burridge, and D. E. Koditschek 
Address: Ann Arbor  
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Laboratory EECS Department, College of Engineering University of Michigan,  
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that a passive vibration strategy can bring a 1 degree of freedom ball to a known trajectory from all possible initial configurations. We draw motivation from the problem of parts feeding in sensorless assembly. We provide simulation results suggesting the relevance of our analytical results to the parts feeding problem.

Reference-contexts: Canny and Goldberg have enlarged and have begun to formalize this program in the effort to minimize sensing and automation complexity without unduly compromising its usefulness [7].

Antecedent to this work, Singer and Seering [20] investigated the problem of parts rocking (rather than bouncing) on a vertically vibrating table.

Reference-contexts: The rejected parts are then recirculated, and the process repeats indefinitely. Research into the probability distribution of stable random part orientations [25] suggests that for a typical part, a minority 2 of the parts will randomly assume the correct orientation. For this reason, rejection based methods are very inefficient <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 We note that flat or round parts have a high probability of randomly assuming a useful orientation, and are easily fed with existing technology.
