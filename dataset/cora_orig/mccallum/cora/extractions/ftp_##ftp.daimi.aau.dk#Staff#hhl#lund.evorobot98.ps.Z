Abstract: Our experiences with a range of evolutionary robotic experiments have resulted in major changes to our set-up of artificial life experiments and our interpretation of observed phenomena. Initially, we investigated simulation-reality relationships in order to transfer our artificial life simulation work with evolution of neural network agents to real robots. This is a difficult task, but can, in a lot of cases, be solved with a carefully built simulator. By being able to evolve control mechanisms for physical robots, we were able to study biological hypotheses about animal behaviours by using exactly the same experimental set-ups as were used in the animal behavioural experiments. Evolutionary robotic experiments with rats open field box experiments and chick detours show how evolutionary robotics can be a powerful biological tool, and they also suggest that incremental learning might be fruitful for achieving complex robot behaviour in an evolutionary context. However, it is not enough to evolve controllers alone, and we argue that robot body plans and controllers should co-evolve, which leads to an alternative form of evolvable hardware. By combining all these experiences, we reach breeding robotics. Here, children can, as breeders, evolve e.g. LEGO robots through an interactive genetic algorithm in order to achieve desired behaviours, and then download the evolved behaviours to the physical (LEGO) robots.

Reference-contexts: In short, it seems possible to reach complex behaviours with a careful design of the evolutionary environmental conditions. However, this practise needs more theoretical investigations. A first step in that direction is represented in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.3 Evolving Robot Morphology Recently, there has been an increasing interest in evolvable hardware (EHW), but the concept does not seem yet to be well-defined.

Reference-contexts: Recent experiments (see above section 3.2 and [25, 27]) do indeed suggest that some kind of shaping is necessary in the process of evolving task achieving robot behaviours, and other important results regarding shaping is found in other robotic directions (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). The difficulties in describing adequate fitness functions (based on extensive studies of the problem domain), are seen by us as one of the main reasons why practically no researchers in the evolutionary robotics field have yet achieved truly complex robot behaviours.

Reference-contexts: This is the approach taken by researchers who do the evolution process entirely on the real robots (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>). The approach has the disadvantage of not allowing many testings of each single control system (few actions and only 1 epoch), so the performance of a single control system will be heavily biased by the initial starting position of the robot.

Likewise, the target area was a circular zone with a radius of 15 cm.

Reference-contexts: Because of the problems with on-line evolution mentioned above, we have advocated a scheme to build simulators for robots, and then evolve the control systems in simulation before transferring the evolved control systems to the real robots in the real environments. Other researchers <ref> [10] </ref> have suggested using a mathematical description of motor and sensor responses of the specific robot.

Reference-contexts: A great number of experiments have been performed in EHW, in which the emphasis has been to show the validity of evolving electronic circuits [6-9, 31]. A quite different approach to EHW, namely an evolvable electro-biochemical system, has been suggested by Kitano <ref> [11] </ref>. There has been some initial approaches using EHW in robotics tasks, most notably by Thompson [33], and if one looks at the definitions of autonomous robots and of EHW, they appear indistinguishable: hardware that can change its architecture and behaviour dynamically and autonomously with its environment.

Reference-contexts: We will here look at this example, but put emphasis on how the robot detour experiments might help us achieving more complex behaviours with the evolutionary technique. Animal psychology literature has intensively investigated detour behaviour in several species of mammals <ref> [12, 32] </ref>. In substance, a detour task consists in reaching a target following trajectories that, for specific environmental constraints (obstacles, different light conditions, etc.), deviate from an optimal approaching path.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the design of a complete autonomous system must include self-organisation, and self-organisation means adaptation of both morphology and control architecture. Together with Lee and Hallam, we <ref> [13, 15] </ref> therefore investigated the possibility of co-evolution between robot controllers and robot body plans in simulation, and we are currently building a LEGO robot system that allows evolution of robot body plans for real robots.

Reference-contexts: The hardware of a robot consists of both the circuit, on which the control system is implemented, and the sensors, motors, and physical structure of the robot. We <ref> [15] </ref> have previously argued that True EHW should evolve the whole hardware system, since the evolution and performance of the electronic hardware is largely dependent on the other parts of the hardware that constitute the system. The latter part is what we called the robot body plan. <p> Indeed, the design of a complete autonomous system must include self-organisation, and self-organisation means adaptation of both morphology and control architecture.

Reference-contexts: This means that the robot has to run for half a year for us to obtain valid results of just one experiment!

Reference-contexts: According to that perspective, we evolved different neural controllers (i.e. different neural architectures: perceptron, with hidden layer, with Elman memory units, etc.) for the Khepera robot equipped with a linear camera (for details see <ref> [21] </ref>). The environment where Khepera acted was a rectangular walled arena of 55x40 cm. It Figure5.

Feed-forward networks were able to make detour behaviour, but only recurrent networks (with Elman memory units) produced optimal solutions (for details see <ref> [21] </ref>). Because of space limitations, here we only want to stress how we "obliged" Khepera to learn the task. In a first series of experiments, we put Khepera directly in an environment containing a U-shaped barrier (such as in figure 5b).

Reference-contexts: The interactive evolutionary robotics approach is inspired by our previous work using interactive genetic algorithms to evolve simulated robot controllers, facial ex-pressions and artistic images (see e.g. <ref> [26, 35] </ref>). In this approach, there is no need of programming knowledge, since all the end-user has to do is to choose between the solutions suggested graphically on the screen.

Reference-contexts: In our view, the best definition of EHW that includes all of the above, is the one by Yao and Higuchi <ref> [36] </ref>, who defines EHW to be hardware that can change its architecture and behaviour dynamically and autonomously with its environment, and they advocate that "EHW should be regarded as an evolutionary approach to behaviour design rather than hardware design" [36]. <p> all of the above, is the one by Yao and Higuchi <ref> [36] </ref>, who defines EHW to be hardware that can change its architecture and behaviour dynamically and autonomously with its environment, and they advocate that "EHW should be regarded as an evolutionary approach to behaviour design rather than hardware design" [36]. A great number of experiments have been performed in EHW, in which the emphasis has been to show the validity of evolving electronic circuits [6-9, 31]. A quite different approach to EHW, namely an evolvable electro-biochemical system, has been suggested by Kitano [11].
