Abstract: ISU Economic Report No. 42 Original Version: April 1997 Revised: May 1997 ABSTRACT Tirole (1985) constructs an overlapping generations economy that includes both private production and unsecured debt and shows that the first welfare theorem fails for this economy. This paper demonstrates that the reason for this failure is that intermediation is modelled as a purely passive coordination activity implemented by a Walrasian Auctioneer. When intermediation is instead modelled as a contestable activity carried out by a corporate intermediary owned by consumer-shareholders and operated in their interest, every equilibrium is Pareto efficient. In broader terms, these findings caution that the inefficiency observed in standard modellings of overlapping generations economies may not be the reflection of an intrinsic market failure. Rather, the observed inefficiency could instead be due to a fundamental incompleteness in the model specification|the presumed inability of private agents to exploit the earnings opportunities associated with incurring and forever rolling over debt. flThe final version of this paper appears in Macroeconomic Dynamics 2 (1998), pages 183-212. The authors are grateful to H. Quirmbach for helpful comments. This paper is based in part on Pingle and Tesfatsion (1991b). For related work, see the Web site of the second author.
