Abstract: A convenient setting for studying multiscale techniques in various areas of applications is usually based on a sequence of nested closed subspaces of some function space F which is often referred to as multiresolution analysis. The concept of wavelets is a prominent example where the practical use of such a mul-tiresolution analysis relies on explicit representations of the orthogonal difference between any two subsequent spaces. However, many applications prohibit the employment of a multiresolution analysis based on translation invariant spaces on all of IR s , say. It is then usually difficult to compute orthogonal complements explicitly. Moreover, certain applications suggest using other types of complements, in particular, those corresponding to biorthogonal wavelets. The main objective of this paper is therefore to study possibly non-orthogonal but in a certain sense stable and even local decompositions of nested spaces and to develop tools which are not necessarily confined to the translation invariant setting. A convenient way of parametrizing such decompositions is to reformulate them in terms of matrix relations. This allows one to characterize all stable or local decompositions by identifying unique matrix transformations that carry one given decomposition into another one. It will be indicated how such a mechanism may help realizing several desirable features of multiscale decompositions and constructing stable multiscale bases with favorable properties. In particular, we apply these results to the identification of decompositions induced by local linear projectors. The importance of this particular application with regard to the construction of multiscale Riesz bases will be pointed out. Furthermore, we indicate possible specializations to orthogonal decompositions of spline spaces relative to non-uniform knot sequences, piecewise linear finite elements and principal shift invariant spaces. The common ground of all these examples as well as other situations of practical and theoretical interest is that some initial multiscale basis is available. The techniques developed here can then be used to generate from such an initial decomposition other ones with desirable properties pertaining to moment conditions or stability properties.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, with a slight abuse of terminology when j has infinite cardinality, the concept of linear independence is well-defined. The functions ' j;k are said to be linearly independent if the mappings F j are injective on the space of all sequences c : j ! IC (see also <ref> [1, 32] </ref>). When dealing with local completions, the uniform stability of f j [ j g is particularly easy to check. <p> As a simple example take S j as the space of piecewise linear continuous functions on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> relative to some set j of knots in [0; 1]. Let j+1 be obtained by adding one additional knot between any two knots in j , i.e., r j is comprised of the new knots between the old ones in j . <p> As a simple example take S j as the space of piecewise linear continuous functions on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> relative to some set j of knots in [0; 1].

[16]), that m := j det M j = #E; (4.30) as well as ZZ s = e2E i.e., E is a set of representers for ZZ s =M ZZ s . <p> In particular, linear independence implies therefore stability. Moreover, linear independence implies the existence of compactly supported biorthogonal functionals <ref> [1, 32] </ref>. This, in turn, can be used to show that the corresponding mask must thus be finitely supported. We are now ready to formulate simple conditions that ensure the existence of stable or even local decompositions of the spaces S ( j ).

For instance, this might concern raising the order of vanishing moments of the basis functions j;k in (1.9) which is important in connection with matrix compression <ref> [2, 20, 21] </ref>. Another example is to identify a basis for complements of the form (1.5) when the Q j are given.

Reference-contexts: This is done by showing that any decomposition can be obtained from any other specific one by means of certain matrix operations (see <ref> [11] </ref> for the shift-invariant case). The usefulness of these observations lies in the following facts. In many cases of interest (see part 2 of the paper) certain initial decompositions are easy to obtain. A typical example are hierarchical bases for nodal finite elements [31].

The limits of these schemes form the biorthogonal collections (see also Remark 3.3 below). Further details with regard to the present general setting can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. Now let us suppose that pairs of uniformly stable biorthogonal collections f j g; f ~ j g are known and hence the projectors Q j defined by (2.48).

Reference-contexts: Then linear independence of the shifts '( ff) is known to be equivalent to the fact that there exists no z 2 IC s such that ^'(z + 2ff) = 0 for all ff 2 ZZ s (cf. <ref> [15, 30] </ref>). In particular, linear independence implies therefore stability. Moreover, linear independence implies the existence of compactly supported biorthogonal functionals [1, 32]. This, in turn, can be used to show that the corresponding mask must thus be finitely supported.

Another example is to identify a basis for complements of the form (1.5) when the Q j are given. <p> Again decompositions induced by local projectors will be identified as specific locally finite ones. Other applications concerning the construction of multigrid ingredients are given in [10]. Raising the order of moment conditions in connection with matrix compression and boundary integral equations has been used in <ref> [21] </ref>. <p> It is also known to be crucial for the construction of optimal multilevel preconditioners for linear systems arising from Galerkin discretizations of elliptic operator equations <ref> [21] </ref>. A more detailed discussion of this issue can be found in [13]. We briefly recall a few facts which are relevant in this context. <p> Given some initial multiscale basis corresponding to stable completions A j;1 with insufficient order of vanishing moments it was pointed out in <ref> [21] </ref> that choosing again K = I one has to determine L j in (3.3) such that L fl j;1 g j+1;r = 0; r = 1; : : : N; where g j;r = (g j;r;k ) k2 j ; g j;r;k := and f r : r = 1;

For instance, in the first part of the assertion it would suffice to assume 0 2 L 2 . The idea of the proof is the same as in the case M = 2I (see e.g. <ref> [25] </ref>). The result may also be viewed as a special case of a corresponding result in [18]. The proof of Theorem 4.2 relies now on the following consequence of Lemma 4.1. Proposition 4.1 Let 0 satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 4.1 with finitely supported a 0 . <p> In view of Lemma 4.1, the proof follows exactly the lines of <ref> [25] </ref> ensuring extensibility of a 0 in the case of stability and using the Quillen-Suslin Theorem in the case of linear independence. It only remains now to reinterpret these facts in terms of the setting considered in Sections 2, 3. <p> We argue as in <ref> [25] </ref> and infer form the Quillen-Suslin Theorem that there exist additional finitely supported masks ^ a e , e 2 E fl , such that ^ A (z) = (^a e e 0 (z)) e;e 0 2E has determinant one on (IC n f0g) s .

Reference-contexts: The need for dealing with stable decompositions of 28 spline spaces with irregular knot sequences arises, for instance, in connection with mul-tilevel preconditioning schemes for elliptic boundary value problems when the boundary conditions are not incorporated in the trial spaces but are appended by Lagrange multipliers <ref> [26] </ref>. This facilitates the use of shift-invariant trial spaces. However, when these trial functions are generated by translates of box splines, say, their traces on polygonal boundaries are in general univariate splines with nonuniform knot sequences.

Reference-contexts: Then linear independence of the shifts '( ff) is known to be equivalent to the fact that there exists no z 2 IC s such that ^'(z + 2ff) = 0 for all ff 2 ZZ s (cf. <ref> [15, 30] </ref>). In particular, linear independence implies therefore stability. Moreover, linear independence implies the existence of compactly supported biorthogonal functionals [1, 32]. This, in turn, can be used to show that the corresponding mask must thus be finitely supported.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, with a slight abuse of terminology when j has infinite cardinality, the concept of linear independence is well-defined. The functions ' j;k are said to be linearly independent if the mappings F j are injective on the space of all sequences c : j ! IC (see also <ref> [1, 32] </ref>). When dealing with local completions, the uniform stability of f j [ j g is particularly easy to check. <p> In particular, linear independence implies therefore stability. Moreover, linear independence implies the existence of compactly supported biorthogonal functionals <ref> [1, 32] </ref>. This, in turn, can be used to show that the corresponding mask must thus be finitely supported. We are now ready to formulate simple conditions that ensure the existence of stable or even local decompositions of the spaces S ( j ).
