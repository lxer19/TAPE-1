Abstract: The achromatic number for a graph G = hV; Ei is the largest integer m such that there is a partition of V into disjoint independent sets fV 1 ; V 2 ; : : : ; V m g such that for each pair of distinct sets V i , V j , V i [ V j is not an independent set in G. Yannakakis and Gavril [7] proved that determining this value for general graphs is NP-complete. For n-vertex graphs we present the first o(n) approximation algorithm for this problem. We also present an O( p

Reference-contexts: The largest integer m for which G has a complete coloring is called the achromatic number (G) of the graph. Computing the achromatic number for a general graph was proved NP-complete by Yannakakis and Gavril [7]. Bodlaender <ref> [1] </ref> proved, further, that the problem remains NP-complete even when we limit the graphs to be connected graphs which are both interval graphs and co-graphs simultaneously. However, the complexity of computing the achromatic number for trees is an open problem [1]. <p> Bodlaender <ref> [1] </ref> proved, further, that the problem remains NP-complete even when we limit the graphs to be connected graphs which are both interval graphs and co-graphs simultaneously. However, the complexity of computing the achromatic number for trees is an open problem [1]. For graphs that are complements of trees this problem can be solved in polynomial time [7]. An approximation algorithm for a problem, loosely speaking, is an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and produces an "approximate solution" to the problem.

Reference-contexts: We now observe that since G has girth at least six, (G) is O (n 3=4 ). We note that is O ( p jEj). Further, every n-vertex graph with girth at least g has at most n n g2 edges <ref> [2] </ref>. The proof follows. We omit the proof of the following theorem in this extended abstract. Theorem 2.4.

Reference-contexts: We will say that an algorithm is an ff-approximation algorithm for a maximization problem, if it always delivers a solution whose value is at least a factor 1 ff of the optimum. ff will be called the approximation ratio. See <ref> [3] </ref>, [5], and [6] for more details. In the next section we present polynomial time algorithms for approximating the achromatic number. Our main result is an approximation algorithm for fl Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within a factor of n 1* for any * &gt; 0 where n is the number of vertices in the graph <ref> [4] </ref>. Our strategy is to follow a semi-greedy approach. We keep picking vertices that are adjacent to or cover a large number of as yet uncovered vertices and stop if this cannot be done. This guarantees that we have picked a small set of vertices.
