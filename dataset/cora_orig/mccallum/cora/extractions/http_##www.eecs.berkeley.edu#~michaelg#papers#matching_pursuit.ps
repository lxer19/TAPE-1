Title: MATCHING PURSUIT WITH DAMPED SINUSOIDS

Abstract: The matching pursuit algorithm derives an expansion of a signal in terms of the elements of a large dictionary of time-frequency atoms. This paper considers the use of matching pursuit for computing signal expansions in terms of damped sinusoids. First, expansion based on complex damped sinusoids is explored; it is shown that the expansion can be efficiently derived using the FFT and simple recursive filterbanks. Then, the approach is extended to provide decompositions in terms of real damped sinusoids. This extension relies on generalizing the matching pursuit algorithm to derive expansions with respect to dictionary subspaces; of specific interest is the subspace spanned by a complex atom and its conjugate. Developing this particular case leads to a framework for deriving real-valued expansions of real signals using complex atoms. Applications of the damped sinusoidal decomposition include system identification, spectral estimation, and signal modeling for coding and analysis-modification-synthesis.

Reference-contexts: In comparison to this SVD approach of computing a non-sparse solution and thresholding it, the goal of compression is better served by simply searching for a sparse approximate solution to the under-determined inverse problem. One algorithm for computing such sparse approximate solutions is known as matching pursuit <ref> [1] </ref>. Investigation of matching pursuit and similar methods is readily motivated by the compaction improvement that can be achieved with respect to traditional linear methods such as the SVD. <p> For reasons to be discussed, the matching pursuit does not find this optimal sparse solution; however, it does reliably identify the fundamental signal structure. 2. MATCHING PURSUIT Matching pursuit is an iterative algorithm for deriving signal decompositions in terms of expansion functions chosen from a highly redundant dictionary <ref> [1] </ref>. Equivalently, it is matching pursuit approximation (circles) to an underdeter-mined inverse problem; the representations have the same reconstruction error. <p> ICASSP, 1997 1 c fl IEEE 1997 an approach for computing sparse approximate solutions to underdetermined inverse problems; the dictionary elements, or atoms, correspond to the columns of D in the linear system. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the dictionary consists of Gabor atoms, which are scaled, modulated, and translated versions of a single window function. This set of functions, which notably includes both Fourier and wavelet-like bases, is highly redundant when the scale, modulation, and translation parameters are not tightly restricted. <p> After I iterations, the decomposition (or sparse approximate solution) corresponds to the estimate x [n] i=1 The mean-squared error of this approximation, namely the energy of the residual, converges to zero as the number of iterations approaches infinity <ref> [1] </ref>. This convergence property implies that I iterations will provide a reasonable I-term estimate; this I-term approximate solution, however, is in general not optimal in the mean-squared sense. <p> THE ALGORITHM To enable representation of a wide range of signal features, a large dictionary of time-frequency atoms is used in the matching pursuit algorithm. The computation of the correlations hg; r i i is thus intensive. As noted in <ref> [1] </ref>, this computation can be reduced using an update formula derived from equation 2; the correlations at stage i + 1 are given by hg; r i+1 i = hg; r i i ff i hg; g m (i) i (14) where the only new computation required for the correlation update

Reference-contexts: Since the dictionary is not orthogonal, the term-by-term matching pursuit approach does not find the optimal I-term expansion; determining the optimal I-term expansion based on a non-orthogonal dictionary requires finding the minimum projection error over all I-dimensional dictionary subspaces, which is not computationally feasible for large I <ref> [2] </ref>. Though searching for the optimal high-dimension sub-space is not reasonable, it is reasonable to consider the related problem of finding an optimal low-dimension subspace at each iteration of the matching pursuit algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The residual has energy before the onset of the original signal, which the matching pursuit algorithm then attempts to remove at subsequent stages. One approach to this problem is the high-resolution matching pursuit algorithm suggested in <ref> [3] </ref>, where symmetric atoms are still used in the pursuit, but the correlation metric is modified so that atoms that introduce such artifacts are not chosen for the signal decomposition. Another approach is to use asymmetric atoms such as damped sinusoids. <p> Future work includes exploration of this approach and other similarly aggressive methods for audio coding and analysis-modification-synthesis as well as comparisons with the high-resolution matching pursuit discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 6.
