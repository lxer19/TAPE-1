Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of providing efficient network support to distributed real-time applications with different communication requirements. In the case of resource reservation protocols, the level of efficiency of a transport service connection provided by a communication system is influenced by the applications requirements, in terms of amount of network resources needed to provide guaranteed Quality of Service. We consider the Tenet protocol suite, a connection-oriented in-ternetworking set of protocols based upon resource reservation. The suite provides a real-time network service (i.e., a service with guaranteed performance) to two types of applications: continuous media (CM) clients that generate data at regular time intervals (e.g., video and audio); message oriented clients that generate data at arbitrary times (e.g., urgent messages and remote control applications). We compare the performance of the transport protocol for CM clients (CMTP) to that of the transport protocol for message oriented clients (RMTP). In particular, we consider the buffer usage in the underlying real-time internetwork protocol (RTIP). The results of the simulations show that in the CMTP case, by taking advantage of the regular nature of CM clients, proper mechanisms can be adopted to further smooth traffic, so that buffers are used much more efficiently than in the RMTP case.

Amongst these, we choose to consider the latter because of the availability of an implementation of the suite and because a simulation model was already availabile.

Reference-contexts: The suite incorporates the concept of real-time channel, a simplex unicast end-to-end connection with performance guarantees (e.g., guarantees on end-to-end delay and packet loss probability). The number of real-time channels the network can accept is limited by channel admission control tests which take place before establishing a new channel <ref> [5] </ref>. A new version of the protocol suite, based on a multicast channel abstraction, is currently under development [6]. The network/client interface model takes the form of a contract between the client and the network.

The network/client interface model takes the form of a contract between the client and the network. The client promises to obey certain traffic restrictions and the network undertakes to provide a certain pre-agreed level of service. This service model implies: 1. Admission control.
