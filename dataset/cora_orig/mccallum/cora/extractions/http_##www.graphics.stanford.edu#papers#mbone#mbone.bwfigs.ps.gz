Abstract: We present a case study of visualizing the global topology of the Internet MBone. The MBone is the Internet's multicast backbone. Multicast is the most efficient way of distributing data from one sender to multiple receivers with minimal packet duplication. Developed and initially deployed by researchers within the Internet community, the MBone has been extremely popular for efficient transmission across the Internet of real-time video and audio streams such as conferences, meetings, congressional sessions, and NASA shuttle launches. The MBone, like the Internet itself, grew exponentially with no central authority. The resulting suboptimal topology is of growing concern to network providers and the multicast research community. We create a geographic representation of the tunnel structure as arcs on a globe by resolving the latitude and longitude of MBone routers. The interactive 3D maps permit an immediate understanding of the global structure unavailable from the data in its original form as lines of text with only hostnames and IP addresses. Data visualization techniques such as grouping and thresholding allow further analysis of specific aspects of the MBone topology. We distribute the interactive 3D maps through the World-Wide Web using the VRML file format, thus allowing network maintainers throughout the world to analyze the structure more effectively than would be possible with still pictures or pre-made videos.

Reference-contexts: The early map generating efforts, which culminated in a four-page PostScript printout requiring hand-tiling, were abandoned in mid-1993 <ref> [1] </ref>. Since then, the topology of the MBone has only been available through lists of tunnels and its detailed geography has not been drawn. We build on the work of researchers at the University of Cambridge, who maintain a publicly available list of the topology of the MBone [4].

Reference-contexts: There has been previous work in geographical network visualization, most prominently by Eick et al. at Bell Labs. This group has presented the 2D interactive SeeNet system for realtime visualization of telephone networks and offline visualization of Internet traffic <ref> [2] </ref>. The more recent SeeNet3D system visualizes worldwide Internet traffic using a visual metaphor of arcs on the globe [6]. Our current work uses the same visual metaphor, but in a different context. The influential work of Cox and Patterson at NCSA was a videotape rather than interactive software.

Reference-contexts: fundamental goal of the project is to make the interactive 3D maps available to as many people as possible. 4.1 VRML In pursuit of this objective, we chose to use the VRML 1.0 (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) format for distributing 3D data with embedded hyperlinks across the World Wide Web <ref> [3] </ref>. VRML popularity is growing quickly, and there are already many 3D browsers available for a wide variety of platforms [7]. By making our 3D maps available on the Web as VRML files, we allow the MBone community to interactively explore the MBone structure.

We build on the work of researchers at the University of Cambridge, who maintain a publicly available list of the topology of the MBone <ref> [4] </ref>. This data is generated by the mwatch program developed at University College London which lists the IP addresses (and often hostnames) of mul-ticast routers at tunnel endpoints. We have augmented the Cambridge list with information about MBone routers in some of the firewalled private networks.

Reference-contexts: Multicasting, a network distribution methodology which efficiently transmits data to multiple receivers, is now being widely deployed to solve some of the problems inherent in these new services <ref> [5] </ref>. Some current uses of the MBone include distributing audio and video streams of conferences, seminars, interactive meetings, and media events. It may see increasing usage as a communication mechanism for networked multi-user 3D applications. Production Internet routers are only recently beginning to support native multicast.

The height of the arc depends on the length of the geodesic, using essentially the same equation as the SeeNet3D system <ref> [6] </ref>. We briefly experimented with using the same height for all arcs, but the display quickly became very cluttered. Having the arc height depend on its length lends visual emphasis to long arcs, an advantage for our application since we want inordinately long tunnels to stand out.

Reference-contexts: The Pablo project at UIUC has also investigated geographic-based network visualization, displaying bars on the globe to represent traffic from the UIUC Web server to individual cities <ref> [8] </ref>. Under the presumption that most of the client sites are in domains that represent a single location, they used the InterNIC domain database to map the domain name to the location registered in the database when the domain name was assigned.

Reference-contexts: Such a representation, not tied to the geography of the Earth, is amenable to display in 3D hyperbolic space <ref> [9] </ref>. However, it can be quite a challenge to obtain the relevant data for many network attributes, for instance delay variation as a metric of goodness.

Reference-contexts: The link points to hypertext that contains the IP address, hostname, location (city/state/country), and latitude and longitude of the tunnel endpoints. The visualization engine used for most of our development has been done on an adaption of the WebOOGL 3D Web browser <ref> [11] </ref>, built on top of the Geomview platform [12]. Most VRML browsers do not support interactive changes of color, linewidth, and position on a per-group basis. In fact, the VRML 1.0 file format does not facilitate per-group interactions (this restriction is will be lifted in future VRML 2.0 systems).
