Abstract: This paper describes an approach to modelling drug activity using machine learning tools. Some experiments in modelling the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) using a standard, Hansch, method and a machine learning system Golem were already reported in the literature. The paper describes the results of applying two other machine learning systems, Magnus Assistant and Retis, on the same data. The results achieved by the machine learning systems, are better then the results of the Hansch method; therefore, machine learning tools can be considered as very promising for solving that kind of problems. The given results also illustrate the variations of performance of the different machine learning systems applied to this drug design problem.

Regression trees are similar to binary classification trees. The most important distinction is that, while classification trees are used to classify objects into discrete classes, regression trees are used when the class is continuous.

Reference-contexts: When building the regression tree, no pre-pruning was used. The obtained tree was then m-pruned <ref> [5] </ref> for various values of the parameter m.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is well known that biological drug activity is related to its molecular structure. An important issue in the process of drug design is how to determine the quantitative relationship between the structure and the activity of drugs <ref> [6] </ref>. The standard method for determining the structure-activity relationship is the Hansch method [3]. On the other hand, many machine learning methods offer a possibility to automatically synthesize the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). King et al. in [6] used the machine learning system Golem for the modelling of QSAR. <p> to determine the quantitative relationship between the structure and the activity of drugs <ref> [6] </ref>. The standard method for determining the structure-activity relationship is the Hansch method [3]. On the other hand, many machine learning methods offer a possibility to automatically synthesize the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). King et al. in [6] used the machine learning system Golem for the modelling of QSAR. They report that machine learning can yield rules that model a QSAR of the specified class of drugs better than the Hansch method [3]. <p> Each of the 24 non-hydrogen substituents is described with 9 chemical properties: polarity, size, flexibility, hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen-bond acceptor, donor, acceptor, polarisability and effect. The detailed description of substituents together with their chemical properties can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> If some drugs have an identical activity, the same rank is assigned to them all, calculated as the mean of the ranks that drugs would have had if their activity had been slightly different. Ranking from paired-comparison was done using the David method (see section 4.1) as in <ref> [6] </ref>. 3 Comparison of results of different methods was done by calculating the Spearman rank--order correlation coefficients of the predicted and observed ranks (see section 4.2), for each method. 4.1 Ranking from paired-comparison A translated problem results with drug pairs represented by a relation greater activity (X i ; X j <p> the former. 5 Experiments and Results Since our goal was to compare the results of two machine larning systems with the results of the Hansch method and Golem, example set was split into training example set (44 examples) and testing example set (11 examples) in the same way as in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5.1 Magnus Assistant Magnus Assistant [7] | an implementation of the Assistant algorithm | was used in our experiments. It enables experiments with several hundreds of attributes and thousands of examples. <p> It enables experiments with several hundreds of attributes and thousands of examples. Since Assistant is designed to classify objects into discrete classes, the original structure-activity problem was translated to learning of the relation "greater activity" over the pairs of drugs (as in <ref> [6] </ref> for the program Golem). Examples are drug pairs, each example described by a boolean class and values of 44 attributes (22 for each drug) describing drug's structure and chemical properties. A value of the class indicate whether the first drug's activity is greater then the activity of the second. <p> By translating the original problem, the original set of 44 training and 11 testing examples is transformed into the set of 1742 training and 1046 testing examples, which were obtained from the authors of experiments with the system Golem described in <ref> [6] </ref>. When building classification trees, various values and combinations of pre-pruning parameters were used [1], starting with no pruning (0, 100, 0) and gradually increasing the influence of pre-pruning. 2 Trees generated in this way were tested on 11 drugs producing ranking of drugs. <p> it can be concluded, that machine learning tools are promising for modelling biological information. 7 Conclusion The work described in this paper was done in order to compare the results of two machine learning systems, Magnus Assistant and Retis to the results of Golem and the Hansch method described in <ref> [6] </ref>. All the systems were applied to the same data. The predicted values were compared by the correlation coefficient to the observed values, resulting with a real number (correlation coefficient) for each method/system. The idea of comparing the correlation coefficients is borrowed from the paper [6] and can be considered useful <p> the Hansch method described in <ref> [6] </ref>.

The same idea can be used to illustrate the variations of performance of different machine learning systems.
