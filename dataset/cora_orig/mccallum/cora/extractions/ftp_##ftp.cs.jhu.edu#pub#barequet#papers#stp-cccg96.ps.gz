Title: Optimizing a Corridor between Two Polygons with an Application to Polyhedral Interpolation  
Author: Gill Barequet Barbara Wolfers 
Keyword: surface reconstruction, plane-sweep, branching surfaces, slice interpolation, polyhedra.  
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a corridor (a separating strip) between two polygons, whose intersection with a third (convex) polygon is of maximum area. The application in mind is the interpolation in simple branching cases, where the sought volume branches from one contour in one slice into two polygons in another parallel slice. We present a linear-time plane-sweep algorithm which computes such a corridor. When the third polygon is not convex the running time of the algorithm is quadratic in the size of the input.

Reference-contexts: In the full version we review these works in detail. The fairly simple 1-to-2 branching cases are usually solved by merging the two contours in one slice into one contour by adding "bridges" between them [CS, Sh, EPO, MSS]. As noted in several works (e.g., in <ref> [Sh, BS] </ref>), the bridges in one slice may be inconsistent with the geometry of the other slice, if they are not added with care.

Reference-contexts: Since the choice of a corridor between P and Q of maximum intersection-area with R becomes irrelevant (in case 1) or of less significance (in case 2), we prefer in these cases the corridor between P and Q of maximum width. First, we use the algorithm described in <ref> [Ed] </ref> for finding the closest pair of vertices p 2 P; q 2 Q which lie on their convex hulls. The corridor C + of maximum width between P and Q is supported by p and q and orthogonal to pq.

Reference-contexts: First we compute the convex hulls of the polygons P and Q. This step requires O (n) time (see, e.g., <ref> [Me] </ref>). Then we initialize the algorithm by computing six event lists. The two lists of events of type 1 require first locating the first and last events (vertices) of P and Q and then constructing the event lists.
