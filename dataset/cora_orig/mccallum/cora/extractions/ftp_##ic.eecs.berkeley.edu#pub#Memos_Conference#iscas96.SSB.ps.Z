Abstract: This paper addresses the analysis of combinational cycles in synchronous, sequential circuits. A circuit that has a combinational cycle does not necessarily have unstable output behavior: the cycle may be "false" for all reachable states and possible input sequences, or the unstable behavior on the cycle may not affect the outputs. We provide a procedure to determine whether a circuit produces a unique, stable output sequence for every input sequence provided by the environment, under all possible circuit delays; such a circuit is called "output-stable". In addition, if a circuit is determined to be output-stable, then we provide a means of producing an equivalent sequential circuit, without combinational cycles.

Reference-contexts: These features could be incorporated into our procedure as well. In Section 2, we present our circuit model, which is based on a model given by Brzozowski and Seger <ref> [1] </ref>. We proceed to describe circuit output-stability with respect to the circuit model. By ignoring the internal behavior of a circuit, 1 We refer to the set of possible input sequences as "sequential care inputs", and the complement of this set as "sequential don't care inputs". <p> At a given point in time, if w i 6= W i (w), then w i is said to be unstable. The ith delay element is modeled by an up-bounded inertial (UIN) delay, bounded from above by some constant D i <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Note that an outcome state may or may not be stable. Brzozowski and Seger prove that, independent of the circuit topology, the circuit must be in an outcome state after = (2 m 2)D units of time <ref> [1] </ref>. However, it may be possible to prove a smaller bound based on the specific topology of a circuit. Now we are ready to discuss the mode of operation over multiple clock cycles.

Reference-contexts: By accounting for these points and not requiring next state functions to be stable, we can treat a larger class of circuits. In fact, for the circuit model that we introduce, our algorithm correctly classifies all circuits (i.e., it is not conservative). The work of Kam and Subrahmanyam <ref> [2] </ref> and Singh and Subrahmanyam [6] also fall into this research area. An example that distinguishes our work from that of Pandey's is the RS-latch given in Figure 1a.

Reference-contexts: The first area has been treated by Malik <ref> [3] </ref>. He defines a circuit composed of logic gates to be "combinational" if for every input pattern, a unique output pattern is produced, independent of circuit delays.

Reference-contexts: We generalize Malik's work by allowing explicit flip-flops in the circuit, and by analyzing sequences of input and output patterns, rather than just single patterns. The second research area is exemplified by the work of Pandey et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. This work is inherently conservative because it does not consider input/output sequences. Hence, their algorithm may reject a circuit if the algorithm finds an output or next state function that does not stabilize for some input/present state combination.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we describe a procedure to decide whether a circuit is output-stable, and show how this procedure can be extended to account for sequential don't cares. Precise definitions and the proof of correctness of our procedure are provided in <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 CIRCUIT MODEL AND OUTPUT-STABILITY Any definition of output-stability must be made with respect to a circuit model. The circuit model should address how the flip-flops are clocked, the delay model used for gates, and the mode in which the environment supplies inputs and reads outputs.

Reference-contexts: In fact, for the circuit model that we introduce, our algorithm correctly classifies all circuits (i.e., it is not conservative). The work of Kam and Subrahmanyam [2] and Singh and Subrahmanyam <ref> [6] </ref> also fall into this research area. An example that distinguishes our work from that of Pandey's is the RS-latch given in Figure 1a. By definition of an RS-latch, an input of 00 always gives a stable output, unless 00 immediately follows input 11, or is the initial input.

Reference-contexts: Cycles that arise in this manner are becoming more common with the emergence of sequential synthesis algorithms that resynthesize a portion of a larger sequential circuit <ref> [7] </ref>. We have developed a procedure to determine whether a circuit is "output-stable"; that is, whether it produces a unique, stable output sequence for every input sequence provided by the environment, under all possible circuit delays. There are two applications of this procedure.
