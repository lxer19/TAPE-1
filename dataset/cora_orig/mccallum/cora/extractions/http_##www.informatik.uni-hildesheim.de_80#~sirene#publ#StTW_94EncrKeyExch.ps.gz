Abstract: In their recent paper, "Encrypted Key Exchange: Password-based Protocols Secure Against Dictionary Attacks," Bellovin and Merritt propose a novel and elegant method for safeguarding weak passwords. This paper discusses a possible weakness in the proposed protocol, develops some enhancements and simplifications, and provides a security analysis of the resultant minimal EKE protocol. In addition, the basic 2-party EKE model is extended to the 3-party setting; this yields a protocol with some interesting properties. Most importantly, this paper illustrates, once again, the subtlety associated with designing password-based protocols.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Encrypted Key Exchange paper <ref> [1] </ref> (hereafter referred to as simply EKE) presents a novel and elegant method of protecting weak secrets from dictionary attacks. It develops several protocol variants based on different underlying cryptosystems, e.g., RSA, El-Gamal, and Diffie-Hellman. <p> It develops several protocol variants based on different underlying cryptosystems, e.g., RSA, El-Gamal, and Diffie-Hellman. The 'generic' version of EKE is illustrated in Figure 1. 1 (Our notation, although unconventional, is largely similar to Bellovin and Merritt's in <ref> [1] </ref>. We use X (Y ) to denote encryption of input Y under the key X.) 1. A =) B A; P (E a ) 3. A =) B K (C a ) 5. <p> The 1 Taken from Figure 7 in <ref> [1] </ref>. 1 remainder of the protocol flows 3, 4, and 5 represent standard hand-shaking that follows key distribution. (C a and C b denote A's and B's challenge values.) 2 Possible Attack As noted in the EKE paper, the generic EKE protocol is susceptible to the type of attack that, for <p> Conversely, if the attacker somehow discovers K, he cannot validate correct guesses of R b and R a thus making a dictionary attack impossible. Therefore, DH-EKE does not require strengthening of the kind shown in Figure 2. One of the improvements suggested in <ref> [1] </ref> is to omit one of the two P -based encryptions (in flows 1 or 2.) The EKE authors judiciously chose as example the elimination of the encryption in flow 1. (The result is that A sends [A; R a ].) It is, perhaps, interesting to note that omitting the encryption <p> DH-EKE (in Figure 3) has four flows and four rounds. At least two encryption operations using the newly-distributed key are required for mutual authentication. As stipulated in <ref> [1] </ref>, at least one password-based encryption is clearly required.

Reference-contexts: This attack was first illustrated by Denning and Sacco <ref> [5] </ref> in their critique of Needham and Schroeder's seminal paper [9]. The attack proceeds as follows: The attacker manages to obtain one of the session keys used in one run of a key distribution protocol.

Reference-contexts: the least complicated variant of EKE with Exponential Key Exchange. 3 EKE with Diffie-Hellman Exponential Key Exchange The Exponential Key Exchange EKE variant (referred to as EKE-DH from here on) is illustrated in Figure 3. (Readers unfamiliar with the details of Diffie-Hellman key exchange are referred to the original paper <ref> [6] </ref> or any of a number of recent texts, e.g., [12, 13].)

Reference-contexts: In summary, M-EKE consists of three messages and three rounds. It is not possible to cut down on either. This can be shown following the ideas of <ref> [7] </ref>. M-EKE requires three encryption operations: one P -based and two K-based. All three are over a single data block. A total of five data blocks are exchanged in the 4 1. A =) B A; P (R a ) 3.

Reference-contexts: This attack was first illustrated by Denning and Sacco [5] in their critique of Needham and Schroeder's seminal paper <ref> [9] </ref>. The attack proceeds as follows: The attacker manages to obtain one of the session keys used in one run of a key distribution protocol. Armed with that knowledge, the attacker is then able to impersonate one of the parties indefinitely often.
