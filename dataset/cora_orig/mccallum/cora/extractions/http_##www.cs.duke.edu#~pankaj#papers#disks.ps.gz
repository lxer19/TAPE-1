Title: Nonholonomic Path Planning for Pushing a Disk Among Obstacles  
Author: Pankaj K. Agarwal Jean-Claude Latombe Rajeev Motwani Prabhakar Raghavan 
Abstract: We consider the path-planning problem for a robot pushing an object in an environment containing obstacles. This new variant of the classical robot path-planning problem has several interesting geometric aspects, which we explore. We focus on the setting where the robot makes a point contact with the object which is assumed to be a unit disk, while the obstacles are assumed to be polygonal.

Reference-contexts: The controllability of the pushed object was analyzed in depth and an effective path planner was implemented using a variant of the algorithm in <ref> [2] </ref>. This algorithm discretizes the search space by integrating, at each step, a small number of feasible motions over a short duration ffit (for a given constant velocity). It is asymptotically complete, i.e., if a solution path exists, the planners finds it, provided that ffit is selected small enough.

The contact between P and D breaks when P 's motion is tangent to D. <p> The contact between P and D breaks when P 's motion is tangent to D. As in <ref> [6, 7] </ref>, we assume the quasi-static model, where friction between the disk and its supporting plane is large enough so that there is no motion after pushing ceases. Let O denote the center of D. We study the trajectory followed by O as P pushes D.
