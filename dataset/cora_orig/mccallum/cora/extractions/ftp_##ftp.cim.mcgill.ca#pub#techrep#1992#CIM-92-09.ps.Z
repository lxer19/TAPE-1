Reference-contexts: A typical and widely used ultrasonic ranging device is that produced by the Polaroid Corporation. Its use is described in detail elsewhere <ref> [ 1; 12 ] </ref> . It operates using sound signals with frequencies of roughly 50 kHz. Due to its low cost, wide availability, low weight and low power consumption, Polaroid sonar units can be found on many research and commercial robotic vehicles.

Reference-contexts: Sonar devices are well known for the apparent unreliability of their readings. In a typical sonar scan taken around the compass from a single position, very few of the distance readings returned are accurate direct ranges to the nearest object in the aiming direction. Several authors <ref> [ 3; 11 ] </ref> have produced clever interpretation methods that attempt to cope with this unreliable data. The methods essentially throw away all measurements that do not 3 have sustained support from multiple viewpoints. They do not incorporate sophisticated models of the measurement process.

Reference-contexts: A detailed study of the effects of off-axis energy in the sonar signal, and simulations of these effects can be found in the work of Kuc and Siegel <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> , McKerrow [ 9; 10 ] and Wilkes et al [ 14 ] . Experimental studies of the side lobes have also been reported [ 6 ] . <p> A similar approach can be used to more accurately model sonar sensors. 4. Model and Implementation Earlier models of sonar sensors have accurately modelled the way in which a single sonar pulse is created, interacts with a single surface, and is detected <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . The model presented here utilizes these earlier results in order to model the interaction between the sonar pulse and individual surfaces. <p> It is assumed that the rangefinder incorporates an amplifier whose gain increases with time to compensate for the dispersion of the signal into space (this is also consistent with commonly-used technology [ 12 ] ). The results from Kuc and Siegel <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> that are used to set parameters of the model are related to the transducer impulse response and the ratio of the strengths of a specularly reflected signal and a signal diffracted from a straight edge. <p> Results and Model Validation In order to validate the model against real sonar data, sonar responses obtained with the simulation have been compared with real sonar measurements obtained with two different sonar scanners, and also with measurements reported in the literature. used by Kuc and Siegel to validate their predictions <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . The data in Kuc and Siegel includes range measurements as a function of transducer orientation for a small sample room.

Reference-contexts: Experimental studies of the side lobes have also been reported <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> . <p> If only the interaction between a single sonar unit and a single obstacle in the environment is considered, the distance error associated with a given sonar response can be well modeled by a normal distribution <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> with a slightly longer far distance tail in the distribution than the near tail. A simulation for this type of sonar error model is quite simple to design.

Reference-contexts: It also suggests that least squares or Kalman filtering type approaches would give rise to successful algorithms for integrating sonar measurements, as the noise associated with each measurement can be treated independently and each can be modeled by some Gaussian process. (See <ref> [ 8; 7 ] </ref> for examples of sonar measurement integration algorithms using this type of assumption.) Unfortunately very few environments consist of only a single surface. For more complex environments, sonar errors are not well modeled by independent Gaussian distributions, but are rather highly correlated and very complex.

Reference-contexts: Through a few simple demonstrations of real sonar measurements we show that simple simulations are incapable of accurately describing the sonar errors (or effects) that occur in real environments. More complex simulations (such as <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> ) can account for some, but not all, of the complex effects seen in real sonar data. <p> A detailed study of the effects of off-axis energy in the sonar signal, and simulations of these effects can be found in the work of Kuc and Siegel [ 5 ] , McKerrow [ 9; 10 ] and Wilkes et al <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . Experimental studies of the side lobes have also been reported [ 6 ] . <p> The simulated room 19 The endpoints from successive scans are connected to indicate the region that would be inferred. Several scans are overlayed to indicate the degree of repeata bility. 20 returns infinite responses while the real sonar unit returned "very close" responses. The sonar simulation used here <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> while accurately modeling many of the effects found in sonar measurements, does not accurately model all of the complexities of true sonar measurements. Note that these responses are not to the same scale as the real sonar data. Distance measurements are shown by lines. <p> In addition, the body of the robot may block the returning sonar pulse. (Our simulator <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> does not model this particular artifact as it simulates a robot with a smaller "body"). Corners provide many interesting effects for the interaction of the sonar signal and the two wall surfaces making up the corner. <p> Algorithms which are based on simulated data which lacks this required realism may fail when presented with real data. Holes may appear in corners (when they are not really there), and walls in hallways may be further away than they seem. In addition, simulations exist (for example, <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> ), which are capable of simulating many of the effects found in sonar measurements. 24 The distance measurements returns from the sonar sensors are shown by rectangles.
