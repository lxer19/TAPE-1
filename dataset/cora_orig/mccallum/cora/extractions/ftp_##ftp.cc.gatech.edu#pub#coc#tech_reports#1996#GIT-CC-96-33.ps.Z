Abstract: TeD is a language designed mainly for modeling telecommunication networks. The TeD language specification is separated into two parts | (1) a meta language (2) an external language. The meta language specification is concerned with the high-level description of the structural and behavioral interfaces of various network elements. The external language specification is concerned with the detailed low-level description of the implementation of the structure and behavior of the network elements. The meta language, called MetaTeD, is described in a separate related document. An external language specification, with C ++ as the external language, is described in this document. A software support system for the development and parallel simulation of TeD models is also described.
