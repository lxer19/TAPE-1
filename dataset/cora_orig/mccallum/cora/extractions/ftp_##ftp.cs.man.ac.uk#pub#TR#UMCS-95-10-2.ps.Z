Reference-contexts: Some of the advantages are design exibility, the absence of clock skew, the potential for lower power consumption and performance at the average speed rate rather than at the worst case [1,2]. A successful attempt to produce an asynchronous version of the ARM microprocessor has been reported <ref> [3] </ref>. However, before producing a fully commercial asynchronous chip one must be sure that it is fault-free after its fabrication.

Reference-contexts: A successful attempt to produce an asynchronous version of the ARM microprocessor has been reported [3]. However, before producing a fully commercial asynchronous chip one must be sure that it is fault-free after its fabrication. Testing asynchronous circuits is aggravated by the following factors <ref> [4] </ref>: the presence of a large number of state holding elements in asynchronous circuits makes the generation of tests harder or even impossible; detecting hazards and races is complicated; the absence of synchronization clocks decreases the level of test control over the cir cuit.

Reference-contexts: The main building block widely used in asynchronous VLSI circuits is the Muller C-element. Brzozowski and Raahemifar showed that the testing of line stuck-at faults in different implementations of the C-element is not trivial <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The basic CMOS inverter shown in Figure 2a consists of two types of transistors: p-type and n-type transistors <ref> [9] </ref>. When input x is low the n transistor is off and the p transistor is on. Output y is connected to the power supply voltage (V dd ) which corresponds to a logical one.

Several attempts to implement a scan test in asynchronous circuits have been published [14-16]. Scan testing presumes that the circuit is set to scan test mode where all its state holding elements are connected together forming a united scan chain.

Reference-contexts: Scan testing presumes that the circuit is set to scan test mode where all its state holding elements are connected together forming a united scan chain. The scan path can be controlled either synchronously or asynchronously <ref> [16] </ref>. As a consequence, the states of all memory elements are controllable and observable. State holding elements of a scan testable circuit must operate at least in two modes: normal and scan test modes. In normal operation mode, the circuit performs according to its specification.

Reference-contexts: Consider an implementation of the scan testable CALL element in order to demonstrate how the C-element shown in Figure 10 can be used to build more complex scan testable asynchronous blocks. The CALL element is an event driven logic block <ref> [17] </ref>.
