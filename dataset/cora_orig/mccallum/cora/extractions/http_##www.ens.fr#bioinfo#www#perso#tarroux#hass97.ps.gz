Abstract: Visual processes do not amount to a simple filtering process performed by a series of hierarchical modules. They allow to select the items immediately useful for the current action from the information included in the external scene. To perform this selection, attentional top-down controls must combine with bottom-up information issued from the retina. In the prospect to understand how these informations are fused together, a computational model of the first steps of the visual process able to account for the pre-attentional and attentional mechanisms involved in visual search has been developed. This model, called Competitive Search, integrates the dynamical aspects of a local dynamical architecture. It accounts for 'pop-out' and attentional phenomena involved in the search for conjunctive targets without introducing ad hoc hypothetical mechanisms such as the attentional spotlight hypothesis. It suggests that such metaphors, issued from the conventional cognitive psychology, may in fact hide simple anatomo-functional arrangements of the circuits that process the visual information. The consideration of these metaphors as covering a specific mechanism is misleading. In the case investigated here, the dynamics of the neuronal circuits may by itself provide an explanation for the observed phenomena associated with the visual search of conjunctive targets.

Reference-contexts: This assumption has received a general agreement in the past few years (Nothdurft and Li, 1985; Knierim and Van Essen, 1992; Merigan, Nealey and Maunsell, 1993). Another arguments can be derived form the observation that there seems to be an almost complete interocular transfer of these perceptual learning effects <ref> (Ahissar and Hochstein, 1996) </ref>. For that reasons, we suppose that the presence of attentional, top-down controls as early as in area V2 is likely, or at least not contradictory with the present available data. The present model offers an explanation to these perceptual learning effects.

Reference-contexts: A reexamination of Treisman's experimental conditions has led Wolfe to conclude that the classical condition for conjunctive search is not as difficult as found by Treisman <ref> (Cave and Wolfe, 1990) </ref>. On the contrary, in controlled conditions, it gives rise to shallow slopes for the relationship linking reaction times to the number of distractors. <p> We supposed here that the presence or the persistence of the display in the lower layers of the visual system is the sole source of information on which the decision is elaborated. As in other models <ref> (Cave et al., 1990, Tsotsos, 1995) </ref>, it has been assumed that the constancy of the inputs fits the conditions of the experiments the model has been designed to account for. 18 is plotted against the SOA duration.

Reference-contexts: These last phenomena are modulated by top-down controls. Among these controls, the ones issued from memory seem to play such a major role that attention and memory involvements can be considered as two facets of the same mechanism <ref> (Desimone, 1996) </ref>. During a behavioral task, the identification, by the visual system, of a target appropriate for the completion of the task first activates a working memory system in which a representation of the target is elicited.

Reference-contexts: Object or location-based attention Two types of attentional mechanisms have been proposed so far. The first one is based on attention to locations (Posner, Snyder and Davidson, 1980) while the second relates to the attention to objects <ref> (Duncan, 1984) </ref>. In spite of a recent reexamination of 22 this classification (Vecera and Farah, 1994), it seems that some points have to be clarified.

Reference-contexts: It can be derived from recent studies <ref> (Duncan, Humphreys and Ward, 1997) </ref> that attentional effects should be viewed as gradual effects affecting most of the visual areas rather than the result of the action of a central executive. <p> It is also consistent with the hypothesis that attention is essentially a competition mechanism biased in favor of the relevant objects <ref> (Duncan, et al., 1997) </ref> This organization accounts for the attentional modulations of V2 neurons reported by Moran and Desimone (1985), and Motter (1993). It explains why these modulations are not spatially defined and precedes the presentation of the target.

Reference-contexts: In these conditions, the visual system acts in a closed loop way, and the processing of a visual scene is part of a behavior. Certainly a lot of areas are preset before one reach the situation at which the scene under consideration is processed <ref> (Laberge, 1995) </ref>. The visual system does not operate on a tabula rasa. Instead, it is driven by the complex activity existing in higher cortical areas before processing the visual scene.

Reference-contexts: Several studies have illustrated this point of view (Allport, 1987; Gibson, 1979; Gibson, 1986). However, the influence of computational approaches has led to models in which the visual system is considered as a passive receptor, a set of filters organized in a modular way <ref> (Marr, 1982) </ref>. This conception gave rise to computer vision systems organized as hierarchic and modular architectures (Milanese, 1993). It has also been very influential on our conception of the biological visual system itself. Unfortunately, artificial systems based on these principles do not compare favorably with natural ones.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, identification of an unknown item at a precued position belongs to location-based attentional processes. It is worth noting that this spatial aspect of precuing, as it is revealed by the observations of Luck et al. (1997) and Motter <ref> (Motter, 1993) </ref>, seem to spatially modulate neurons in the same layers as neurons modulated by object-based attention. These observations suggest that a similar mechanism is used for location-based attention and for object-based attention. It only assumes that the control signals can carry both feature -specific and positionspecific- information.

Reference-contexts: This behavior enables the target to be detected as well as in a conventional conjunction search. As stated above, Motter recently reported that V4 neurons exhibit attentional modulations mediated by the short term memory of a given cue <ref> (Motter, 1994) </ref>. Luck, Chelazzi, Hillyard and Desimone (1997) reported similar results in a spatial-attention task. These observations suggest that top-down controls provide down to this layer an information on the nature of the feature relevant to the choice of the final item.

Reference-contexts: When the conjunctive feature is coded as the activation of a single cell type sensitive to both characteristics of the stimulus, our model predicts a 'pop-out' behavior (the cells corresponding to the target are isolated on their map). This is exactly what is observed for stereo disparity <ref> (Nakayama and Silverman, 1986) </ref>. Thus, the present model supports an alternative explanation to the parallel/serial distinction between preattentive and attentive mechanisms. Preattentive filtering may be essentially a parallel static process while 26 attentive mechanisms may rather be based upon temporal switching toward the attented item.

Reference-contexts: However, attention enhanced activity and activity due to pop-out both produce sustained activities of the concerned neurons. It is thus possible to predict that whatever the modulation by which these objects are tagged, a similar modulation could distinguish pop-out and attended objects from non-salient ones. In the tagging hypothesis <ref> (Niebur, Koch and Rosin, 1993) </ref>, the discrimination between 'tagged' attended stimuli is achieved through the low pass filter properties of V4 neurons. This hypothesis has been introduced to explain the fact that the mean firing rate of V2 neurons seemed to be unaffected by attentional modulation.

Reference-contexts: In Treisman's early proposals, binding is necessary to achieve the integration of features. Alternative hypotheses make it a selection mechanism induced by attention (Eckhorn and Schanze, 1991; Fujii, Ito, Aihara, Ichinose and Tsukada, 1996) or a way to enhance the saliency of an item <ref> (Singer and Gray, 1995) </ref>. In this respect, the most recent studies consider binding rather as a consequence than a cause of the attentional mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, though the intermodality coupling mechanism is mediated here by gating inhibitory interneurons, it is likely that other mechanisms can exhibit equivalent properties. The model suggests the existence of a crosstalk between pathways processing different features information. A recent study <ref> (Tamura and Sato, 1996) </ref> has shown that such crosstalk abilities are present to a greater extent in V2 than in V1.

Reference-contexts: FIT supposes the existence of a feature integration mechanism and thus poses the 'binding' problem at a very low integration level in the visual system <ref> (Treisman, 1988) </ref>. In Treisman's early proposals, binding is necessary to achieve the integration of features. Alternative hypotheses make it a selection mechanism induced by attention (Eckhorn and Schanze, 1991; Fujii, Ito, Aihara, Ichinose and Tsukada, 1996) or a way to enhance the saliency of an item (Singer and Gray, 1995).

Reference-contexts: As proposed by Koch and Ullman (1985), this target may be determined through the use of a Winner-Take-All (WTA) mechanism. This serial scan hypothesis, in which a spatially focused spotlight is supposed to screen out a saliency map, has been termed the spatial attention hypothesis <ref> (Treisman, 1996) </ref>. One of the main support of this theory is the fact that the detection time for conjunctive targets appeared to be roughly twice as high in blank trials than when the target was present. <p> It must be emphasized that in her more recent papers, Treisman seems to promote a very similar idea of an early control of feature binding by attention <ref> (Treisman, 1996) </ref>. One important difference with previous FIT-based models is that they provide the lower layers of the visual system with both spatial and descriptive information about the target. Competitive Search assumes that top-down information deals only with the description of the potential target.

Reference-contexts: All these models are exclusively based on data collected from psychophysical experiments. They are then expressed in psychological terms with a few connections with the underlying neuronal mechanisms <ref> (Treisman, 1980) </ref>. They use a series of black boxes reminiscent from the modular conception that remain to be explained in terms of the underlying neuronal circuitry. Thus, they address the question of the nature of the top-down signal in an ad hoc way.

Reference-contexts: According to this ideas, attention is not a mechanism to solve the modularity problem by the integration of separable features in unitary objects, but, on the contrary, modularity brings solutions to solve the attention problem <ref> (Van der Heijden, 1995) </ref>. We also agree with Green (Green, 1991; Green and Odom, 1991) which propose that attention would be a mask rather than a beam acting through the inhibition of the nonrelevant features instead of through the enhancement of the relevant ones.

Reference-contexts: This interpretation is misleading. A more convenient view is that of a progressive involvement of attentional controls in the hierarchy of visual areas. This progressive mechanism seems to correlate with an increase in complexity of the filtering function of these areas <ref> (Van Essen and Gallant, 1994) </ref>. This view is consistent with the neurophysiological data showing a behavioral modulation of neurons located in various visual areas.

Reference-contexts: Object or location-based attention Two types of attentional mechanisms have been proposed so far. The first one is based on attention to locations (Posner, Snyder and Davidson, 1980) while the second relates to the attention to objects (Duncan, 1984). In spite of a recent reexamination of 22 this classification <ref> (Vecera and Farah, 1994) </ref>, it seems that some points have to be clarified. Due to the hypothetical presence of a spotlight visiting each spatial position of the display, attentional mechanisms concerning most of the visual search paradigms have been classified into spatial attention.

Reference-contexts: This result is effectively consistent with the hypothesis of a self-terminating scanning mechanism exploring the whole visual scene in search for the target. Guided Search Wolfe proposed the 'Guided Search hypothesis' to explain some anomalous results that Treisman's FIT fails to explain <ref> (Wolfe, Cave and Franzel, 1989) </ref>. A reexamination of Treisman's experimental conditions has led Wolfe to conclude that the classical condition for conjunctive search is not as difficult as found by Treisman (Cave and Wolfe, 1990). <p> One possible preliminary explanation can be provided by the observation that, in our model, the slope values strongly depend on the intensity of the modulation between the characteristics maps. This result can explain both the high variability of the detection rates for different subjects <ref> (Wolfe and al., 1989) </ref> and the results obtained by Treisman and Gormican (1988). These rates could indeed depend on the basic connection level between the characteristics maps in the different subjects. They can also be affected by low contrast conditions if these conditions interfere with the coupling mechanism. <p> Discussion and conclusions Discussion Biological foundations of the model Unlike the previous models, the present proposal assumes that the sites at which pop-out and detection of targets defined as conjunctions of basic features occur are located in the same layers of the visual cortex <ref> (Wolfe et al., 1989) </ref>. It also assumes that the attentional controls act down to a relatively low level in the visual system.
