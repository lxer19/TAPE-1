Abstract: The process of applying machine learning to data mining may require many trials, backtracking, and multiple executions of different learning and inference procedures. Such a process can be time-consuming, laborious, and prone to errors. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an integration of diverse learning and inference procedures into a system that can automatically pursue different data mining tasks according to a high-level plan developed by a user. The solution involves a metalanguage, called KGL (Knowledge Generation Language), for specifying a data exploration process in terms of high-level operators and conditional statements that depend on the results of previous operators. Operators invoke corresponding machine learning and inference programs, and specify their parameters according to the current tasks and previous results. To assist in illustrating the outcomes of exploration they are organized into association graphs (AGs), which can indicate logical, statistical and equational relationships in the data. The methodology is exemplified by preliminary results in the areas of demographics and medicine.

Reference-contexts: This reiterates that a condition might not lead to a higher propensity for a disease except when combined with the other represented conditions. In another experiment that used the results of parent-children surveys the source of the data was the National Youth Survey (United States), Wave I <ref> (Elliott 1977) </ref>. This dataset catalogued the answers of parents and their children to various social and behavioral issues. It included socioeconomic data, records of problems at home or in the neighborhood, parental aspirations, attitudes toward deviance, discipline, community involvement, and drug use.

Reference-contexts: A language in which a different approach to the acquisition of knowledge is KQML <ref> (Finin et al. 1994) </ref>. KQML is viewed as a tool by which intelligent agents may communicate among themselves and exchange the information needed to complete their individual tasks. It is thus designed to permit queries for individual pieces of knowledge.

Reference-contexts: They support the search for patterns, trends or exceptions in data. While INLEN was the first such system, several recent data exploration systems have also adopted an integrated, multi-operator architecture, for example, KEPLER (Wrobel et al. 1996) and DBMiner <ref> (Han et al. 1996) </ref>. The major differences between INLEN and them are INLENs focus on a seamlessly integrated flow of knowledge segments, a wider range, and more powerful knowledge generation operators. <p> Most previous efforts to create a high-level language for multistrategy learning and knowledge discovery have taken a Prolog-style logic programming approach. One notable exception is M-SQL <ref> (Imielinski, Virmani, and Abdulghani 1996) </ref>, which extends the SQL data query language by adding the ability to query for certain types of rules and invoke a rule-generating operator.

Reference-contexts: The INLEN system integrates a relational database, a knowledge base, machine learning and statistical knowledge generation operators . To be able to perform easily operators that require both data and knowledge, the concept of a knowledge segment was developed <ref> (Kaufman, Michalski, and Kerschberg 1991) </ref>. Knowledge segments are used for passing results from one operator to another and to the user. One research issue addressed in INLENs development has been how to implement and utilize such knowledge segments.

Reference-contexts: INLENs knowledge base has evolved a syntactic structure based on the VL1 variable-valued logic representation <ref> (Michalski 1973) </ref> and the ideas of Annotated Predicate Calculus (Michalski 1983).

Reference-contexts: For example, Birth Rate is between 10 and 20, characterizes all 42 low-fertility countries and 20 others. This representation schema leads to a natural division of a rule base into subunits, each described by a set of pertinent statistics <ref> (Ribeiro, Kaufman and Kerschberg 1995) </ref>. An example of this structure is shown in Figure 2. The application of an operator (recorded as an individual learning Session) is associated with an input data set, the time at which it was run, and a set of output Rulesets.
