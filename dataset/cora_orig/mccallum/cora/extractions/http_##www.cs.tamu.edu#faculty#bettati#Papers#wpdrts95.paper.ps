Abstract: HIPPI provides a very-high-speed communication medium, which is very well suited for a large number of bandwidth-demanding distributed applications. Unfortunately, its circuit-switched nature makes it very difficult to provide real-time guarantees when connections contend for network resources. We present a time-division-multiplex access scheme designed to give timing guarantees to high-speed connections. We describe the problem of scheduling the access to a HIPPI network, and show that, although the problem is very unlikely to be computationally tractable, very simple heuristics give high network utilizations for moderately-sized networks. We present the RMP/RMCP protocol, our implementation of the scheme described in this paper on the XUNET-West HIPPI testbed.

Reference-contexts: The bandwidth requirements of such applications are expected to be in the hundreds of megabits per second, and therefore exceed the bandwidth offered by existing cell-switched technologies (e.g. 155Mb/s ATM). We have investigated the applicability of circuit-switched network technologies, in particular High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) <ref> [1, 2] </ref> for this class of applications. HIPPI is a simplex point-to-point interface for transferring data at very high rates (800Mb/s or 1600Mb/s) over limited distances (up to 25 meters). HIPPI physical layer switches can be used to interconnect multiple devices into a local area network [3].

Reference-contexts: In order to bound connection setup delays due to contention for network resources, however, proper con nection management strategies must be devised. The HIPPI standard does not address the issue of how to manage connection setup. Chlamtac et al. <ref> [5] </ref> analyze and compare connection management schemes for clusters of crossbar switches with respect to connection delay and throughput. The described approaches fail to guarantee either bounds for connection delay or bandwidth allocation.

Reference-contexts: This scheme can lead to deadlocks and to unbounded connection setup delays. The HIPPI standard does not provide a way to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, some recommendations are made about how to reduce connection setup delays <ref> [6] </ref>. In particular, these recommendations discourage from keeping connections too long (in order to reduce blocking times) and from camping on during connection setup. Although avoiding camping on eliminates the possibility of deadlocks, an additional protocol is necessary to avoid unbounded connection setup delays.

Reference-contexts: Although avoiding camping on eliminates the possibility of deadlocks, an additional protocol is necessary to avoid unbounded connection setup delays. Channel acceptance protocols for circuit-switched networks must rely on a global scheduling scheme of the network resources (as opposed to local schemes used in packet-switched networks <ref> [7] </ref>). Whenever a connection is being set up, all necessary resources have to be available at that particular point in time for the setup to get through. Typically, global resource access schemes rely on collision resolution, tokens, or time division multiplex.

Reference-contexts: Whenever a connection is being set up, all necessary resources have to be available at that particular point in time for the setup to get through. Typically, global resource access schemes rely on collision resolution, tokens, or time division multiplex. Traditional collision resolution schemes, such as tree-based resolution <ref> [8] </ref>, are not applicable for HIPPI-style high-speed networks because of the high amount of bandwidth lost due to the resolution process.

Reference-contexts: Additional schemes, such as timed tokens in FDDI, must be used to give timing guarantees. Such schemes substantially reduce the maximum utilization of the network resources by real-time traffic, e.g. by two thirds for the case of timed tokens in a ring <ref> [9] </ref>. Time-division multiplexing (TDM), on the other hand, avoids resource contention by explicitely laying out the transmission schedule. This obviates the need for expensive collision resolution schemes and results in a high utilization of the network because it allows for high concurrency of access to the network resources.

Reference-contexts: the problem of feasibly scheduling a set of channels with identical periods on a network of arbitrary topology is identical to the time slot assignment problem to minimize completion time in unbuffered SS/TDMA with intersatellite links, which has been proven to be N P-complete even for very simple interconnection topologies <ref> [12] </ref>. It is therefore very unlikely that the problem of generating feasible TDM schedules for varying periods is tractable for networks with more than one switch. The problem is polynomi-ally solvable (using network flow, for example) for a single switch.

Reference-contexts: As the bandwidth of cell-based technology increases, so does the need for larger buffers in the switches to accommodate long bursts of traffic.
