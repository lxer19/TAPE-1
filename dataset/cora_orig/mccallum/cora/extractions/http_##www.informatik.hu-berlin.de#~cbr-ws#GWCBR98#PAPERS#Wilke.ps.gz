Abstract: This paper motivates the necessity for support for negotiation during Sales Support on the Internet within Case-Based Reasoning solutions. Different negotiation approaches are discussed and a general model of the sales process is presented. Further, the traditional CBR-cycle is modified in such a way that iterative retrieval during a CBR consulting session is covered by the new model. Several general characteristics of negotiation are described and a case study is shown where preliminary approaches are used to negotiate with a customer about his demands and available products in a 'CBR-based' Electronic Commerce solution.

Therefore we suggests a modified cycle shown in Figure 2 regarding the different situation in electronic sales support applications.

Reference-contexts: However both approaches present two extremes on a continuum of possible underlying problems. In existing research, negotiation during the search in an electronic catalogue is seen as a competitive approach <ref> [Beam and Segev, 1996] </ref>. They assume a conflict in the price of a good were all other attributes of the desired product are fixed. Competitive negotiation takes place if there is at least some conflict of interest between the buyer and the seller.

Reference-contexts: The approaches in the area of computer science are most applicable to product search and negotiations in electronic commerce. Mainly research in the field of intelligent agents provides different approaches to the topic of electronic negotiations. A survey of these approaches can be found in <ref> [Beam and Segev, 1997] </ref> 1 . We distinguish different approaches also by their underlying technology in the electronic shopping solution. Catalogue-based approaches are a replication of their printed counterparts. They support the navigation in the electronic catalogue with an index or an ontology.

Reference-contexts: The kind of allowed modifications must be described as a part of the general knowledge in the product base. One negotiation approach from the intelligent agents area is Kasbah 6 <ref> [Chavez and Maes, 1996] </ref>, where such modifications are described for every attribute in a function that determines the kind of allowed modification for every negotiation step (here, every iteration of the sales process). Modification in Single or Multiple Dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Modifying both descriptions is part of the negotiation between the customer and the electronic sales agent in the electronic shop as shown in Figure 2. One step forward is the use of adaptation techniques during the product configuration phase <ref> [Schumacher et al., 1998] </ref> were the product is modified to satisfy the customer's needs. Product specific suggestions to the customer to modify his problem description in a predefined way can lead to satisfying product search.

These applications support the retrieval of products by a similarity based match. However, the whole CBR process can improve more than one step in the selling process via the Internet.
