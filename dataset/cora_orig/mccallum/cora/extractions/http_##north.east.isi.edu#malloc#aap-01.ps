Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This document defines a Multicast Address Allocation Protocol (AAP) that forms a part of a larger multicast address allocation architecture <ref> [1] </ref>. The general framework with which AAP is designed to operate is best describes by describing the process by which a multicast address is allocated: INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-malloc-aap-01.ps August 19, 1998 1.

Reference-contexts: The general framework with which AAP is designed to operate is best describes by describing the process by which a multicast address is allocated: INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-malloc-aap-01.ps August 19, 1998 1. As a continuous process, a higher level protocol, MASC <ref> [2] </ref>, provides a multicast address set, from which addresses should be allocated to an allocation domain. 2. MASC routers periodically send advertisements of this address set to Multicast Address Allocation Servers (MAAS) within the allocation domain using AAP address-set advertisement messages. 3.
