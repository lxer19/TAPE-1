Reference-contexts: As a result, PIM-SM has the advantage that it will only send multicast packets where they have been requested, and will not broadcast the initial packets as the current multicast protocol does. The PIM-SM protocol is similar to Core-Based Multicast Trees <ref> [1] </ref> in that it uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) to arrange for the senders and receivers of a multicast group to meet. This RP then also becomes the root of a sparse multicast tree with the multicast group members being the leaves of the tree.

Reference-contexts: If not, the message is simply ignored. However, the multicast group information has to be propagated very carefully. Because of the large number of atoms and partitions and the resulting large number of multicast groups, we will modify the Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) <ref> [4] </ref> which is slated by the Internet Engineering Task Force to become the future standard multicast protocol. PIM-SM is meant to be used in wide-area networks, networks which are bandwidth poor, or multicast groups which have few or widely-scattered members.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Linking an IP Address with a geographical location has been of interest for quite some time. The first attempt to design a system that actually routes packets according to their geographic destination and the work that is closest to ours is Cartesian Routing by Gregory G. Finn <ref> [5] </ref>. Xerox's PARC lab also pioneered early work on location dependent services [9]. The recent redesign of the Internet Protocol (IP) [2] and the advent of the Global Positioning System [10] [11] [12] has given a new stimulus for this work.

Reference-contexts: The geographic messaging project introduces location as a "first class citizen" both in message addressing as well as in service discovery. The protocols described above are a part of the geographic addressing and messaging Request For Comments, published in November 1996 <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Once it receives a geographic message, a GeoRouter must first determine if it services any part of the area of the destination polygon. To do this, the router determines if the destination polygon and the router's service area polygon intersect 1 <ref> [7] </ref> each other. If not, then the router simply sends the message to its parent router. However, if the polygons intersect or contain each another, then the router does service the area described by the intersection polygon.
