Abstract: We have discussed the diverse issues that are encountered in the simulation of any large-scale telecommunications network: modeling of source traffic, network control, switch design, and the effective interaction of all these elements in a unified context. The Ptolemy system was introduced to address these issues. Specifically, we considered a cell-relay network with centralized control that provided basic call-processing capabilities. The Ptolemy MQ domain was developed to support the design of this control element, and specific examples were given to illustrate its use in modeling control subsystems. Also, we considered the design of space-division packet switches with associated queueing policies. Two basic designs were presented, that of a pure Banyan network utilizing intermediate queueing and an input queueing stru-cure followed by a nonblocking Batcher-Banyan cascade network. Our primary measures of performance of these switches were their average throughput and the end-to-end delay incurred by packets. We presented results of simulations to gather these statistics for two scenarios: simple-one switch configurations with always-active sources and a complete large-scale ATM network governed by a centralized control. Thus, by explaining the issues involved in the modeling of these network elements and the nature of their interaction, challenges that arise in the successful simulation of any large-scale, heterogeneous system become clear.
