Title: A GENERALISED MODEL FOR UTILISING PROSODIC INFORMATION IN CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION  
Author: Andrew Hunt

Affiliation: Speech Technology Research Group, University of  
Abstract: Prosodic features in continuous speech provide cues which may be used to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities and to increase the accuracy of speech recognition/understanding systems. This paper presents a novel method using a multivariate statistical framework for producing a model of the relationship between prosodic and syntactic structures in continuous speech. The model can be used for Linguistic/Phonetic research and in speech synthesis. This paper concentrates on its use for integrating prosodic information into a continuous speech recognition system. The model can produce a relative probability score for the conformance of the prosodic and syntactic structures of hypothesised sentences for an existing word recognition system and achieves 73% accuracy in disambiguating structurally ambiguous sentences.
