Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of resource allocation and control for an ATM node with regulated traffic. Both guaranteed lossless service and statistical service with small loss probability are considered. We investigate the relationship between source characteristics and the buffer/bandwidth trade-off under both services. Our contributions are the following. For guaranteed lossless service, we find that the optimal resource allocation scheme suggests a time scale separation of sources sharing an ATM node with finite bandwidth and buffer space, with the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is determined by the sources' time scale. For statistical service with a small loss probability, we present a new approach for estimating the loss probability in a shared buffer multiplexor with the so called extremal on-off, periodic sources. Under this approach, the optimal resource allocation for statistical service is achieved by maximizing both the benefits of buffering sharing and bandwidth sharing. The optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is again determined by time scale separation. Besides their obvious application to resource allocation and call admission control, our results have many other implications in network design and control such as network dimensioning and traffic shaping.

Each virtual circuit is associated with a traffic source that is leaky bucket regulated <ref> [1, 18] </ref>. We consider the following two scenarios. In the first scenario, each virtual circuit is allocated a fixed portion of the total bandwidth and buffer space with no resource sharing among the virtual circuits.

Reference-contexts: Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. (QoS) guarantees for a variety of applications with very diverse traffic characteristics. In <ref> [9] </ref>, a new approach to resource allocation in an ATM node with fixed bandwidth and a finite, shared buffer is presented. <p> This reduction is made possible by introducing the concept of a virtual buffer/trunk system and establishing the exchangeability of buffer and bandwidth. Based on the analytical results, a qualitative theory is then described which provides many insights in call admission control. Motivated and inspired by the work in <ref> [9] </ref>, we study source characteristics and their impact on buffer/bandwidth trade-off in the design and control of an ATM node. The starting point of our approach is the examination of optimal resource allocation schemes for guaranteed lossless service. <p> For statistical service where a small loss probability is allowed, we derive a new approach to estimate the loss probability using our results for the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off obtained for lossless service. By giving a new interpretation to the virtual trunk/buffer systems introduced in <ref> [9] </ref>, we are able to transform the two-resource allocation problem into two independent single-resource allocation problems. The best buffer/bandwidth separation is explored by optimizing resource allocation along the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off curve. <p> Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that source time scales also have a major impact on the optimal resource allocation under statistical service, and the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is again reflected by the source time scale separation. Our work differs from <ref> [9] </ref> in several aspects. First, our perspectives on resource allocation and control problems are somewhat different. The authors in [9] are primarily interested in call admission control.

First, our perspectives on resource allocation and control problems are somewhat different. The authors in [9] are primarily interested in call admission control. This is reflected in their fixing the system bandwidth C and buffer space B. Resource allocation to each source is independent of the sources' characteristics. <p> This is important, as the efficacy of buffer sharing and that of bandwidth sharing for sources with different time scales are quite different. Numerical examples indicate that our approach provides a better estimate of the system loss probability than <ref> [9] </ref>. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We start with the optimal resource allocation problem for guaranteed lossless service in Section 2, and demonstrate the relationship between source time scale and optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off. <p> In Section 4, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the relationship between source time scale and buffer/bandwidth trade-off. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated and comparison with the results in <ref> [9] </ref> is also made. The pa per is concluded in Section 5. 2 Guaranteed Lossless Service The starting point of our study is the analysis of the optimal resource allocation scheme for guaranteed lossless service. Consider an ATM node with a total amount of bandwidth C and buffer space B. <p> In other words, the lossless service buffer requirement B min for the given value of bandwidth C exceeds B.

Then S = P T on = P P . S is known as the source burst-size.

By choosing different resource pairs (C v ; B v ) along the buffer/bandwidth trade-off curve, the virtual lossless segregate system regulates the sources' bandwidth and buffer requirements, thus providing a tradeoff between them. <p> In this case, we have that lim 1 log P loss sup (C v ;B v ) minffl fl C v (c); fl fl (15) Actually we can show (see <ref> [12] </ref>) that the choice of (C v ; B v ) can be restricted to the segment of the buffer/bandwidth trade-off curve where C v C and B v B (the highlighted segment on the buffer/bandwidth tradeoff curve in Figure 4). <p> Since fl fl C v (c) is a decreasing function in C v while fl fl B v (b) is an increasing in C v , the above optimization can be solved in a straightforward manner <ref> [12] </ref>. Let C fl v denote the solution to the optimization problem, then the loss probability P loss can be estimated by e Nfl fl (c) e B fl v .
