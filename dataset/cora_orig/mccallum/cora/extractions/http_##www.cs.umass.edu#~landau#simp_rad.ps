Abstract: Radical simplification is an important part of symbolic computation systems. Until now no algorithms were known for the general denesting problem. If the base field contains all roots of unity, then we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a denesting, and our algorithm computes a denesting of ff when it exists. If the base field does not contain all roots of unity, then we show how to compute a denesting that is within one of optimal over the base field adjoin a single root of unity. Throughout our paper, we choose to represent a primitive l th root of unity by its symbol l , rather than as a nested radical. The algorithms require computing the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of ff over k, and have exponential running time.

Reference-contexts: It is not hard to go from such a polynomial to one which splits completely and whose roots are linearly independent over k. Artin gave an effective method for calculating such a polynomial. We reproduce it here. Theorem 4.2 (Artin <ref> [1] </ref>) If L is a Galois extension of k, and 1 ; : : : ; r are the elements of the group G, then there is an element in L such that the r elements 1 = 1 (); : : : ; r = r () are linearly independent

Reference-contexts: Thus in time polynomial in the degree of the splitting field, and the size of the minimal polynomial of ff over k, we can compute the Galois group. It has long been known how to compute commutator subgroups quickly from a group table; recently Babai, Luks and Seress <ref> [2] </ref> showed how to do so in O (r 4 log c r) steps, for a permutation group on r elements.

Reference-contexts: If f (x) is a polynomial in O k , where k = Q [t]=g (t) is a number field, then there are polynomial time algorithms for factoring f (x) over O k [6], [10]. Following <ref> [3] </ref>, a formula over a field k and its depth of nesting are defined as follows: (1) an element of k is a formula of depth 0 over k, (2) an arithmetic combination (A+B, A fi B, A/B) of formulas A and B is a formula whose depth over k is <p> There is some disagreement about this issue. Borodin et al <ref> [3] </ref> define the size of ff to be m, the depth of nesting of ff. Under this measure, they gave an algorithm for denesting a nested class of square roots. This algorithm has polynomial arithmetical complexity, but exponential bit complexity. <p> This algorithm has polynomial arithmetical complexity, but exponential bit complexity. The latter comes from the doubling of bits which occurs at each extension. We believe that this problem is inherent in any denesting scheme, and that the measure defined by <ref> [3] </ref> is too conservative. Under our measure, their running time is 16 polynomial. <p> The case of nested square roots was treated by Borodin et al <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: By Hadamard's inequality <ref> [5] </ref>, the coefficients of D (x) are bounded by (rjf (y)j) 9r 2 . There is an a less than r 2 for which D (a) is non-zero.

Reference-contexts: 1 Background We begin with a brief review of some algebraic concepts. The reader who is unfamiliar with this material is advised to consult <ref> [8] </ref> or [14] for algebraic number theory and Galois theory, and [13] for group theory. Let k be a field. Throughout this paper we assume that k is of characteristic 0. An element ff is algebraic over k iff ff satisfies a polynomial with coefficients in k. <p> We can adjoin it to k. Thus the field extensions of k made by considering the fixed fields L D i G can all be made to be radical extensions. We will need to make use of: Theorem 3.5 (Lang <ref> [8] </ref>, pp. 196-7.) Let K be a Galois extension of k, and F be an arbitrary extension of k. Then KF is Galois over F , and K is Galois over K " F .

Reference-contexts: If k is an algebraic number field, it contains a set of elements which satisfy integer monic polynomials over Z; this is called the ring of integers of k, and is frequently denoted O k . In 1982, Lenstra, Lenstra and Lovasz <ref> [11] </ref> showed that f (x) in Q [x] can be factored in polynomial time. If f (x) is a polynomial in O k , where k = Q [t]=g (t) is a number field, then there are polynomial time algorithms for factoring f (x) over O k [6], [10]. <p> If the degree of the splitting field is polynomially bounded, then so is the running time of the algorithm. 28 Recall also that nearly all of the bounds follow from the factoring bound given in <ref> [11] </ref>, and that bound is almost certainly not optimal. What is important to remember is that what is theoretically slow may be practically fast, and vice versa.
