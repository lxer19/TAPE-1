Title: THE CONTINUOUS RETINA: IMAGE PROCESSING WITH A SINGLESENSOR ARTIFICIAL NEURAL FIELD NETWORK

Abstract: Silicon retinas are typically implemented with multiple photosensors. Recent work with VLSI extended analog computers has led to a single-photosensor retina. It is called a continuous retina because the image focused on it generates a current gradient within the sensor, as opposed to independent currents in multiple sensors. The current gradient is discretized into an analog output vector, then classified by a trainable on-chip artificial neural field network. The continuous retina is compact. A VLSI implementation that recognizes several letters fits onto one MOSIS "TinyChip".

Reference-contexts: PISCES can also handle implantation discontinuities used to form MOSFET and BiCMOS device, but these are not a factor in conductive sheet design.) The sheet was discretized for output onto a 50x50-element square mesh (Figure 1b). A preprocessor for SPICE <ref> [Almeter95] </ref> was used to generate a 16x16 finite-element mesh of resistors, with electrodes modeled as 1 ohm resistors (Figure 1c).

Reference-contexts: The simulated photocurrent gradient was measured on a 13x14 grid (Figure 1a). MatLab was used to simulate a square conductive sheet modeled by Poisson's equation with the diffusion constant set to the permittivity of silicon. (PISCES uses a similar approach <ref> [Dutton/Yu93] </ref>. PISCES can also handle implantation discontinuities used to form MOSFET and BiCMOS device, but these are not a factor in conductive sheet design.) The sheet was discretized for output onto a 50x50-element square mesh (Figure 1b).

Reference-contexts: The early vision tasks explicitly performed by multiplesensor retinas are subsumed by the field computation of the ANFN. The continuous retina and other ANFNs are implemented as extended analog computers (EAC) [Rubel93].

Reference-contexts: For example, an EAC can control a quadropole electromagnet in a cyclotron beam line by solving the boundary-value problem that describes the particle beam and using the solution to generate a control signal <ref> [Mills95c] </ref>. The continuous retina is compact because the EAC's conductive sheet doubles as the ANFN's F function, reducing explicit intersensor wiring to zero. The L function is implemented as four LLAs with an analog computation path that does not require ADCs and DACs.
