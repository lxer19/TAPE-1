Title: Adaptive Runtime Support for Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Methods on Distributed Memory Architectures  
Author: Bongki Moon Joel Saltz

Abstract: In highly adaptive irregular problems such as many Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) codes, data access patterns may vary from time step to time step. This fluctuation may hinder efficient utilization of distributed memory parallel computers because of the resulting overhead for data redistribution and dynamic load balancing. To efficiently parallelize such adaptive irregular problems on distributed memory parallel computers, several issues such as effective methods for domain partitioning and fast data transportation must be addressed. This paper presents efficient runtime support methods for such problems. A simple one-dimensional domain partitioning method is implemented and compared with unstructured mesh partitioners such as recursive coordinate bisection and recursive inertial bisection. A remapping decision policy has been investigated for dynamic load balancing on 3-dimensional DSMC codes. Performance results are presented.

This algorithm requires only one step of global communication and a few steps of local computation.

Reference-contexts: This communication schedule remains unchanged as long as the data access patterns remain unchanged. In past work a PARTI runtime support library has been developed for a class of irregular but relatively static problems in which data access patterns do not change during computation. <ref> [14, 4, 5] </ref> To parallelize such problems, the PARTI runtime primitives coordinate interprocessor data movement, manage the storage of, and access to, copies of off-processor data, and partition work and data structures. fl This work was supported by NASA under contract No. NAG-11560, by ONR under contract No. <p> Thus load balance is not an issue for this problem and we can study the effectiveness of the light-weight schedule and data migration primitives without interference from other aspects such as partitioning methods and remapping frequencies. The inspector/executor method of PARTI runtime library <ref> [15, 4] </ref> which is applied to the 2-dimensional problem carries out pre-processing of communication patterns every time step because the reference patterns to off-processor data change from time step to time step. Consequently preprocessing cost is greater for the inspector/executor method than using lightweight schedules.

Reference-contexts: A heuristic has been studied and manipulated to help make remapping decisions dynamically at runtime. A related work that achieves dynamic load balance by monitoring load imbalance at user specified interval has been reported <ref> [6] </ref>. 4.1 Periodic remapping DSMC codes can be characterized by statistical calculations involving particles associated with each cell, particles moved to new cells as a result of calculations, and cells partitioned over the processing nodes.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the periodic remapping method requires potentially impractical pre-runtime analysis to determine an optimal periodicity. Stop-At-Rise (SAR) remapping decision policy has been implemented and experimented, which was introduced previously <ref> [9] </ref>. The SAR heuristic trades the cost of problem remapping against time wasted due to load imbalance. It assumes that processors synchronize globally at every time step, that the cost of remapping and idle time for each processor since the last remapping are known at runtime.

Reference-contexts: Recursive coordinate bisection (RCB) [1] is a well-known algorithm which bisections a problem domain into two pieces of equal work load recursively until the number of subdomains is equal to the number of processors. Recursive inertial bisection (RIB) <ref> [10] </ref> is similar to RCB in that it bisects a problem domain recursively based on spatial information, but RIB uses minimum moment of inertia when it selects bisectioning directions, whereas RCB selects bisectioning directions from x-, y-, or z-dimensions.
