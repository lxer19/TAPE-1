Abstract: The existence of cryptographically secure one-way functions is related to the measure of a subclass of NP. This subclass, called fiNP ("balanced NP"), contains 3SAT and other standard NP problems. The hypothesis that fiNP is not a subset of P is equivalent to the P 6= NP conjecture. A stronger hypothesis, that fiNP is not a measure

Reference-contexts: Only the following very weak type of one-way function is known to exist under the hypothesis that P 6= NP. Definition A weak one-way function is a function that is, for every polynomial t, weakly t (n)-one-way. Theorem 5.1.(Allender <ref> [1] </ref>). P 6= NP if and only if there exists a weak one-way function.

Reference-contexts: is very small. (The reciprocal of this probability can be regarded as the security of f against inversion by g.) One-way functions of this type have been extensively investigated and can be used to construct secure user authentication schemes [8], secure pseudorandom generators [16, 15], subexponential time simulations of BPP <ref> [33, 5] </ref>, secure private key encryption protocols [13, 21, 10], bit commitment protocols [28], and zero-knowledge proofs of NP languages [12]. <p> Yao [33] and Boppana and Hirschfeld <ref> [5] </ref> proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). <p> In partic ular, if the adversary uses a pseudorandom generator, then the seed length must exceed n k . 6 BPP-Pairs and Pseudorandom Generators Yao [33] proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then R T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). Boppana and Hirschfeld <ref> [5] </ref> subsequently 24 refined Yao's argument to get the (apparently) stronger conclusion that BPP *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). In this section we prove that the hypothesis (fiNP j E 2 ) 6= 0 implies a partial converse of this result. <p> Definition A p (n)-generator g is nonuniformly secure if it passes all nonuniform tests.

The following well-known result relates pseudorandom generators to the deterministic time complexity of BPP. Theorem 6.2. (Yao [33], Boppana and Hirschfeld <ref> [5] </ref>). If nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). 2 In fact, Yao, Boppana, and Hirschfeld essentially proved the following, perhaps stronger, result.

Reference-contexts: P 6= NP if and only if there exists a weak one-way function. Using work of Karp and Lipton [18], one can show that the stronger hypothesis p p 2 implies the existence of functions that are, for all polynomials t and r, weakly (t (n)=r (n))-one-way (see also <ref> [6] </ref>), but such functions still do not provide a useful amount of security. In Theorem 5.3 below, we will show that the hypothesis (fiNP j E 2 ) 6= 0 implies the existence of one-way functions with exponential security. The following lemma will simplify our proof. 20 Lemma 5.2.

Reference-contexts: Note that each S j consists of those languages A that are in infinitely many of the sets S [d j;k ]. We now formulate our notion of weak stochasticity. For this we need a few definitions. Our notion of advice classes is standard <ref> [18] </ref>. An advice 9 function is a function h : N ! f0; 1g fl : Given a function q : N ! N, we write ADV (q) for the set of all advice functions h such that jh (n)j q (n) for all n 2 N. <p> Definition A weak one-way function is a function that is, for every polynomial t, weakly t (n)-one-way.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that one-way functions with essentially minimum security requirements have also been defined and investigated. (See <ref> [31] </ref> for a survey of such work.) That is, a polynomial time computable, honest function f is sometimes considered to be one-way if every feasible algorithm g sometimes fails to invert f .

Reference-contexts: exponentially hard complexity core [17]; there is an NP search problem that is not efficiently reducible to the corresponding decision problem [4, 25]; there are problems that are P T - complete, but not P m -complete, for NP [25]; and every P tt -hard language for NP is p-superterse <ref> [3, 32] </ref>. Since fiNP NP, the hypothesis (fiNP j E 2 ) 6= 0 implies the hypothesis (NP j E 2 ) 6= 0.

Reference-contexts: is very small. (The reciprocal of this probability can be regarded as the security of f against inversion by g.) One-way functions of this type have been extensively investigated and can be used to construct secure user authentication schemes [8], secure pseudorandom generators [16, 15], subexponential time simulations of BPP <ref> [33, 5] </ref>, secure private key encryption protocols [13, 21, 10], bit commitment protocols [28], and zero-knowledge proofs of NP languages [12]. <p> Yao <ref> [33] </ref> and Boppana and Hirschfeld [5] proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). <p> Note, however, that such an adversary must use more than n k "truly random" bits. In partic ular, if the adversary uses a pseudorandom generator, then the seed length must exceed n k . 6 BPP-Pairs and Pseudorandom Generators Yao <ref> [33] </ref> proved that, if nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then R T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). Boppana and Hirschfeld [5] subsequently 24 refined Yao's argument to get the (apparently) stronger conclusion that BPP *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). <p> Typically, the polynomial p (n) is much larger than n, so that the generator g, given a short seed x, outputs a long, hopefully pseudorandom, string g (x). The desired notion of pseudorandomness is given by the following definitions, due to Yao <ref> [33] </ref>. Definition A nonuniform test is a language T 2 P/Poly. <p> A uniformly secure pseudorandom generator is a function that is a nonuniformly secure p (n)-generator for some polynomial p (n) n + 1. The following well-known result relates pseudorandom generators to the deterministic time complexity of BPP. Theorem 6.2. (Yao <ref> [33] </ref>, Boppana and Hirschfeld [5]). If nonuniformly secure pseudorandom generators exist, then BPP T *&gt;0 DTIME (2 n * ). 2 In fact, Yao, Boppana, and Hirschfeld essentially proved the following, perhaps stronger, result.
