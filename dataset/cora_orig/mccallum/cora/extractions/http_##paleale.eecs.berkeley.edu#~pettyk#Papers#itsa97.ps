Reference-contexts: For example, a common source of real-time data is loop detector measurements of flow, occupancy and speed. The traits usually associated with loop detectors is that the measurements are noisy (Stephanedes and Chassiakos, 1993), in many cases inaccurate (Hall and Persaud, 1989), and sometimes they skip output periods <ref> (Bloomberg et al., 1993) </ref>. Therefore, special care needs to be taken to filter, clean and structure this real-time loop detector data. Figure 2 gives a simple representation of this processes and an example of what could be done for loop detector data.

Reference-contexts: DRAFT 10 * Travel times estimation and prediction. Once an origin-destination pair is selected, the system could present the user with estimates of the current travel time. One such software system that estimates travel times from preprocessed, single-trap loop data was presented in <ref> (Petty et al., 1996a) </ref>. * Ride matching and reservations.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, special care needs to be taken to filter, clean and structure this real-time loop detector data. Figure 2 gives a simple representation of this processes and an example of what could be done for loop detector data. This process has been successfully implemented in <ref> (Petty et al., 1996b) </ref>. Another example of real-time data which would need to be preprocessed is the incident reports from both the CAD database and the cellular phone calls.

Reference-contexts: Some services that could be offered to system managers would include: * Traffic prediction. This would allow managers to predict the evolution of traffic flow using various models. These estimates could be based on the current loop data, like the approach that was presented in <ref> (Sanwal et al., 1996) </ref>. * Bottleneck identification. Identify changes in traffic states between system components so that in conjunction with the traffic prediction item above one can evaluate system efficiency. * Incident Management. This would include incident detection, verification, and response.

Reference-contexts: This necessitates proper cleaning and filtering of the data before inclusion in the database. For example, a common source of real-time data is loop detector measurements of flow, occupancy and speed. The traits usually associated with loop detectors is that the measurements are noisy <ref> (Stephanedes and Chassiakos, 1993) </ref>, in many cases inaccurate (Hall and Persaud, 1989), and sometimes they skip output periods (Bloomberg et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: Until recently, the data traffic load on a single WWW server to pride traffic information and route guidance calculations for a large metropolitan area would have been prohibitive. But the development of large, distributed servers <ref> (Wahbe et al., 1993) </ref> have reached the point where handling this type of load is reasonable. The push for PC's to be mobile while still connected to the Internet has resulted in the widespread availability of wireless modems.
