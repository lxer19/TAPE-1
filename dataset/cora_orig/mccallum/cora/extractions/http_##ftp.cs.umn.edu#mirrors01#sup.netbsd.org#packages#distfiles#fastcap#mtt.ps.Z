Title: Fast Capacitance Extraction of General Three-Dimensional Structures  
Author: K. Nabors S. Kim J. White 
Date: 40(7):1496-1506, July 1992.  
Note: IEEE Trans. on Microwave Theory and Techniques,  
Abstract: In [1], a boundary-element based algorithm was presented for computing the capacitance of three-dimensional m-conductor structures whose computational complexity grows nearly as mn, where n is the number of elements used to discretize the conductor surfaces. In that algorithm, a generalized conjugate residual iterative technique is used to solve the n fi n linear system arising from the discretization, and a multi-pole algorithm is used to compute the iterates. In this paper, several improvements to that algorithm are described which make the approach in [1] applicable and computa-tionally efficient for almost any geometry of conductors in a homogeneous dielectric. In particular, a new adaptive multipole algorithm is described, along with a strategy for accelerating the iterative algorithm by exploiting electrostatic screening. Results using these techniques in a program which computes the capacitance of general three-dimensional structures are presented to demonstrate that the new algorithm is nearly as accurate as the more standard direct factorization approach, and is more than two orders of magnitude faster for large examples.

Reference-contexts: The evaluation of the potential at (r i ; i ; i ). 7 multipole algorithm given in <ref> [7] </ref>, and used in the FASTCAP program described below, is more sophisticated than the above approach suggests. In particular, multipole evaluations are efficiently combined into local expansions in such a way as to reduce the number of operations to order n. <p> panel k in cube i f For each panel l in cube j f Add P kl q l to p k . g g It should be again noted that, as mentioned at the end of Section III, Algorithm 2 is a simplified version of the hierarchical multipole algorithm <ref> [14, 7] </ref> used in FASTCAP [1].

The structures described below were created with the solid modeling program in the MEMCAD system, PATRAN, or by computer program, and all capacitance calculations were performed using FASTCAP. The multipole-accelerated algorithms in FASTCAP use, by default, second-order multipole expansions and a GMRES convergence tolerance (see Algorithm 1) of 0:01.

A more general, but not as efficient, approach would be to extend to three-dimensions the two-dimensional adaptive algorithm described in <ref> [14] </ref>. In this earlier work, the multipole algorithm is made adaptive by breaking up the problem domain nonuniformly, in which case lowest level squares are of different sizes, where the size is chosen so that each lowest-level square has roughly the same number of panels. <p> The proof follows directly from the fact that the adaptive multipole algorithm, Algorithm 2, evaluates the potential due to panel charges in a cube directly, rather than with a 11 A A Fig. 4. Partitionings used in Algorithm 2, (b), and by the adaptive algorithm of <ref> [14] </ref>, (a). multipole approximation, whenever the number of expansion coefficients would exceed the number of panels. It should be noted that the overhead cost of maintaining a uniform domain partitioning has been ignored in this comparison. <p> It should be noted that the overhead cost of maintaining a uniform domain partitioning has been ignored in this comparison. If the distribution of panels is very nonuniform, a matching nonuniform partitioning, like the approach used in <ref> [14] </ref>, will naturally generate fewer lowest-level partitions, and hence reduce bookkeepping overhead. Careful data organization can make this overhead negligible for typical capacitance calculation problems.
