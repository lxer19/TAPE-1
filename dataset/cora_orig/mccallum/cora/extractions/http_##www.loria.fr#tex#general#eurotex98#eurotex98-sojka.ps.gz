Meehan. </author> <title> Portable Document Format Reference Manual, Version 1.1. </title> <publisher> Addison-Wesley, </publisher> <address> Reading, MA, USA, </address> <year> 1996. </year> <note> Version 1.2 of manual is available in electronic form from http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/adobepdf.html. </note>
Reference-contexts: OSN and OSNND are the biggest Czech en-cyclopdi ever published and are one of the most valuable sources of general information and knowledge, useful not only for historians. As a format for electronic delivery of a digitized encyclopdia Adobe's Portable Document Format <ref> [1] </ref> (PDF) was chosen, because achieving highest visual fidelity with respect to the original was a high priority. This format has been successfully used for WWW and electronic journal publishing [6]. Several free readers of PDF documents are available (Acrobat Reader, xpdf or DocuReader [10]).

Reference-contexts: New methods remain to be developed for automatic semantic-view generation. Unicode [9] support in Acrobat to allow PDF-based Czech searching is awaited for the next OSN encyclopdia regeneration. We are about to experiment and test the variable letter-width technique <ref> [2] </ref> applied to multiple master fonts to achieve more uniform greyness in the text than in the original print. 6. Acknowledgements We acknowledge the enthusiasm, consideration and care of all people we met during our participation in the design of the above-mentioned project.

Reference-contexts: The project has been realized during 1996-1998. Currently, a similar project of digitization of another Czech encyclopdia| "Ott-uv slovnk naucny nove doby" <ref> [3] </ref> (OSNND)|is being undertaken, using the experience from work on OSN. OSN and OSNND are the biggest Czech en-cyclopdi ever published and are one of the most valuable sources of general information and knowledge, useful not only for historians.

Reference-contexts: Otto encyclopdia project We were participating in the design and retypesetting phases of a project aimed at the creation of a digital replica of Czech encyclopdia "Ott-uv slovnk naucny" (OSN) <ref> [4] </ref> (28 volumes, 27 789 pages, 139 418 entries, 4888 illustrations) published in 1888-1908. The project has been realized during 1996-1998. Currently, a similar project of digitization of another Czech encyclopdia| "Ott-uv slovnk naucny nove doby" [3] (OSNND)|is being undertaken, using the experience from work on OSN.

Reference-contexts: the articles in mind. (Yahoo attempts to do this kind of document classification on the Internet.) In our application we have identified the need to generate "see also" links based on a computed measure of "similarity" based on a semantic map of the Czech language using an approach motivated by <ref> [5] </ref>. We could then make the "navigation document" using this semantic net. These links will create an equivalence relation over the encyclopdia entries and applying this approach recursively we can get a tree-structured semantic net of an encyclopdia|the semantic view.

Full scanning and retypesetting of the encyclopdia was needed because the original was typeset using hot type and no original electronic data were available.

Reference-contexts: The standard way of producing PDF from T E X is via a DVI file to Postscript by dvips and then to PDF via Adobe Distiller. Experiments with a modification of T E X which is able to produce PDF directly|pdfT E X program by Han The Thanh <ref> [7, 8] </ref>|were done, allowing for very compact PDF files.

Reference-contexts: An Experience from a Digitization Project 281 delivery is problematic, but can be partially eliminated by offering different document views to the user, taking into account the quite different transportation medium|computer screen. New methods remain to be developed for automatic semantic-view generation.
