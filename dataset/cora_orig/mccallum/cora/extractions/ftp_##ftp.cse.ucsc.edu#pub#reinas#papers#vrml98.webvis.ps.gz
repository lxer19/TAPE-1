Abstract: We describe our efforts in providing REINAS (Realtime Environmental Information Network and Analysis System) weather visualization products on demand through the web. As the REINAS research enterprise transition into operational mode, there is increasing demand for wide and effective distribution of results. To meet this demand, we provide weather products on the web as both images and VRML worlds. The viewer selects geographic extents and time range, as well as specific weather products. Data is then pulled out of the database based on the user's specifications and fed to the visualization tools to produce the image or VRML file. This paper describes the architecture of this end-to-end system for delivering sensor and forecast data through the database and to the public as VRML-based visualization products.

Reference-contexts: Through the years, universities and research labs have created a number of tools to address the visualization needs of different scientific communities. For example, Vis5D [3] and GEMPAK <ref> [1] </ref> are geared towards 3D meteorological data and provide almost all standard imaging options, while VTK [6] is an all-around visualization toolkit. In addition, powerful general-purpose commercial visualization packages such as Data Explorer (DX) and AVS can certainly serve the purpose of making visualizations out of scientific data.

Reference-contexts: Our work in creating this model has been preceded by several important examples of linking data inquiry and retrieval with VRML-based visualizations. As an example, Elvins and Jain <ref> [2] </ref> present a system for choosing a volumetric dataset, and creating isosurfaces "on-the-fly".

Reference-contexts: To accomplish that one needs visualization software that can map the data returned from the database into an interactive image or a VRML file. Through the years, universities and research labs have created a number of tools to address the visualization needs of different scientific communities. For example, Vis5D <ref> [3] </ref> and GEMPAK [1] are geared towards 3D meteorological data and provide almost all standard imaging options, while VTK [6] is an all-around visualization toolkit.

Reference-contexts: With the growth of Internet we are starting to see more applications interactively available over the Web, such as WXP [10] - "The Weather Processor". Nowadays we can monitor the environment with instantaneous readings from a pre-specified view and a number of sensors through the web <ref> [4] </ref>. Other tools, like Vis-a-Web [7], even provide visualization service on the net. Furthermore, [12] describes a scenario where the web publisher mounts the raw data on the Web, and the viewer accesses this data through a modular visualization environment such as the IRIS Explorer.

Reference-contexts: If known, a specific instrument or sensor name can also be requested. A simple RSGet call then populates the structure with the requested measurements. 4 VISUALIZATION ARCHITECTURE We now describe how the data returned through the RSObject API are rendered by the REINAS visualization system called PET SLUG <ref> [5] </ref>. PET is an acronym for Products, Elements, and Tools which reflects the modular architecture of the visualization system. It was originally developed using OpenGL, C++, and xforms [13] for improved portability. PET SLUG has since been extended to produce VRML output files as well.

Reference-contexts: As computing power and communication bandwidth increased, the turnaround time for generating weather products have been shortened. For example, the National Weather Service (NWS) provides hourly updates of wind readings around the San Francisco peninsula <ref> [8] </ref>. With the growth of Internet we are starting to see more applications interactively available over the Web, such as WXP [10] - "The Weather Processor". Nowadays we can monitor the environment with instantaneous readings from a pre-specified view and a number of sensors through the web [4].

Reference-contexts: We have used the Digital Elevation Map file etopo5, available from USGS <ref> [9] </ref> The elevation values are exaggerated to give the terrain a visible relief, and height is also used to produce a texture map coded to the appropriate geographical color-scheme. The output is an elevation grid, the VRML shape well suited for the task of creating terrains.

Reference-contexts: Terrain tool for displaying topography/bathymetry of selected region. 12. Vector plot tool for displaying vector information such as those from CODAR (ocean surface current data) and vertical wind profilers. This tool provides several types of glyphs for representing vector information: arrows, barbs, and uncer tainty glyphs <ref> [11] </ref>. The output from these visualization tools are sent to one or more graphics windows. Each window may have its own region, camera, and associated set of tools. Thus, a graphics window and its contents corresponds directly to a visualization product.
