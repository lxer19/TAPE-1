Abstract: A new method for aberration correction is presented. Using multiple receive beams reconstructed at each transmit direction, image artifacts due to imperfect beam forming can be identified and greatly reduced. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of such a compensation algorithm for blocked elements. In this study, the algorithm is extended for magnitude and phase aberrations. Experimental results show that substantial improvements are possible for small amplitude and phase errors. The compensation method is less effective for large errors, however. Based on this, a two-step procedure is proposed for general aberration correction. First, cross-correlation processing is used to reduce significant phase errors. Then, the adaptive compensation method is applied to remove remaining artifacts due to blocked elements, amplitude aberrations and residual phase errors. This twostep procedure is shown to be effective in significantly reducing image artifacts due to amplitude and phase errors.

Reference-contexts: First, the phase errors due to the above screen were measured at the receiving array using baseband correlation of nearest neighbor elements as described by ODonnell and Engeler in <ref> [4] </ref>. The measured phase aberration at the receiving aperture is shown in of the array. This is shown in Figure 1c. In this simulation, the effects of energy spreading due to the increasing surface area of the wavefront was not included. <p> Any residual phase aberrations, along with amplitude aberrations, can be then corrected with PARCA. To test this procedure, the aberrated image in Figure 15a was used. This image contains both amplitude and phase aberrations. First, baseband correlation of nearest neighbor elements, as described in <ref> [4] </ref>, was used to estimate and remove phase aberrations. The resultant corrected image is shown in Figure 16a. The cross-correlation method increased CNR from 3.01 for the aberrated image to 3.38 for the corrected image. <p> This was demonstrated for the case of blocked elements in [11]. Next, PARCA was incorporated as part of a twostep procedure for aberration correction. The first step uses nearest neighbor correlation processing such as that described in <ref> [4] </ref> to reduce major phase aberrations. The resultant image is then processed by PARCA. Both overall B-scan image quality and quantitative CNR measurements demonstrated that it is very effective in reducing the effects of phase and amplitude aberrations.

Reference-contexts: Although computationally intensive, this approach can yield very accurate instantaneous estimates of delay errors even using signals derived from speckle generating objects. An alternative method, producing accurate error estimates with simplified hardware but long iteration times, maximizes the speckle brightness <ref> [5] </ref>. Recent work from several laboratories has questioned whether a phase screen is an adequate model of aberrations in medical ultrasound [6]. These studies show that the effective impulse response of each array element is influenced by index of refraction variations.

Reference-contexts: An alternative method, producing accurate error estimates with simplified hardware but long iteration times, maximizes the speckle brightness [5]. Recent work from several laboratories has questioned whether a phase screen is an adequate model of aberrations in medical ultrasound <ref> [6] </ref>. These studies show that the effective impulse response of each array element is influenced by index of refraction variations. As demonstrated in the next section, the primary consequence is that both the amplitude and phase vary across the aperture. <p> The first is based on the principle of time reversal, where a received pressure field is timereversed and reemitted to focus on a reflective source through inhomogeneous media [7-9]. The second uses back propagation of waveforms emitted from a pointlike source to compensate for amplitude errors <ref> [6] </ref>. Both methods can fully correct for amplitude and phase errors if a point source can be found in the body. This need for a beacon signal is a major flaw for medical ultrasound, where a truly point target does not exist for most applications. <p> In many cases, such as imaging through the abdominal wall, these aberrations can be modeled as a phase screen located away from the receiving array <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As described previously, a complete data set consisting of 4096 RF AScans sampled at a rate of 17.76 MHz was recorded <ref> [10] </ref>. Each record of the set represents a single element acting as transmitter and an independent element acting as receiver. With these data, a conventional phased array system imaging in the presence or absence of an aberrating phase screen is easily emulated. <p> For reasons of sensitivity and stability, the solution to the TLS problem which minimizes the l- 2 norm of the error vector e is retained. Details of TLS are found in <ref> [10] </ref> and [17]. Although obtuse as stated formally, the TLS method simply allows an additive error to be imposed on each component of the nominal receive beam pattern to produce a distorted pattern.

Reference-contexts: Given this description, all contributions from off-axis scatterers can be identified and subtracted from the measured signal along the transmit direction. Previous studies have shown that up to 3 equivalent sources are all that's needed to greatly improve images produced with a significant number of blocked elements <ref> [11] </ref>. Using a few equivalent point scatterers to model the effects of sidelobe interaction with tissue can be justified by referring to Figure 6c. Again, scatter in the anechoic region corresponds to tissue insonified by sidelobes of the transmit beam. Note that there are several dominant lines within the signal. <p> These results are consistent with previous studies using PARCA to correct beam forming artifacts due to blocked elements, which showed that large contrast objects can be recovered even with significant beam forming artifacts, but that low contrast objects can only be fully recovered in the limit of small beamforming errors <ref> [11] </ref>. To investigate PARCA's capabilities for more modest aberrations, smaller phase errors were used. In addition, small amplitude aberrations consistent with those measured in the body were also emulated. Three sets of experiments were performed as part of these studies. <p> As the level of aberration increases, full compensation is no longer achieved. Nevertheless, there is still significant improvement in image quality. Indeed, previous studies suggest that PARCA performance degrades gracefully as errors (i.e. aberrations) increase <ref> [11] </ref>. Furthermore, when PARCA is used as part of a twostep procedure, major phase aberrations will have already been corrected by a correlation-based scheme. When PARCA is applied to low contrast objects with severe aberrations, low contrast regions are not completely recovered. <p> In the limit of low level aberrations, where sidelobes levels are reduced, low contrast regions can be recovered. This was demonstrated for the case of blocked elements in <ref> [11] </ref>. Next, PARCA was incorporated as part of a twostep procedure for aberration correction. The first step uses nearest neighbor correlation processing such as that described in [4] to reduce major phase aberrations. The resultant image is then processed by PARCA.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we plan to explore further this twostep aberration correction for both large one dimensional arrays and 1.5-dimensional arrays. For large 1.5-D arrays, simultaneous beams must be formed both in azimuth and elevation for PARCA processing <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An amplitude of 1 represents the average across the aperture. The specific pattern was produced with a random number generator, but forced to match the statistics of amplitude fluctuations (i.e., magnitude and correlation length) measured in the human body wall by Hinkelman et al <ref> [13] </ref>. The resultant aberrated image of the heart phantom is presented in Figure 14a, and the PARCA corrected image in Figure 14b. The CNR improved from 3.47 for the aberrated image to 8.39 for the corrected image. Again, image quality is almost fully recovered.

Reference-contexts: Any variations, therefore, can be attributed to the effects of the aberrator. Finally, the decorrelation of the wavefront along the array, as measured by the correlation between the signal from the first element to all other elements, is shown in measured by Trahey et al in breast tissue <ref> [15] </ref>, but less than that measured by Steinberg [16]. Using these measured phase and amplitude aberrations, a second simulation was performed.
