Reference-contexts: The video-signal is sent via a radio-link to a receiver, which is connected to the frame-grabber mounted in the PC system. Images can be grabbed and stored in memory continuously. 1 From a sequence of images the motion field is computed with the method reported in <ref> [1] </ref>. 4. Wall following The camera is mounted rigidly on the vehicle, with the camera axis in the driving direction. <p> eliminate the depth T z =P z from the estimated image motion equations (1) and (2) and obtain: r y _r x r x _r y r y ! y = 0 However, we must keep in mind that the optic flow vectors are estimated from an image sequence (see <ref> [1] </ref>), and that we only have noisy measurements _r x and _r y . In a region R of the image where there is sufficient confidence in the flow-vectors ([1]) the flow is used to make a robust estimate of the camera rotation.
