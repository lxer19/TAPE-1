Reference-contexts: In photoproduction some of the relevant photon lab energies, E fl are, E fl = 7:7 GeV for flp ! c p, 8:2 GeV for flp ! J= p, and 8:7 GeV for flp ! Dfl c . With exception of the SLAC and Cornell photoproduction measurements <ref> [1] </ref>, in the past twenty years all charm production experiments were performed at much higher energies. The lower energy, E fl ~ 10 GeV Cornell data is rather poor and hardly exhibit characteristic threshold behavior.

Reference-contexts: The experimental situation is far from being satisfactory. Even though there has not been much quantitative theoretical work done in this area there is a number of interesting phenomena to be explored <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Charm production has proven to be a sensitive probe of production mechanisms. <p> It has been argued however that there may be important subleading twist contributions coming from the intrinsic charm component of the target wave function associated with diagrams shown in Fig. 2b [8]. It is also possible to use open charm production to study these, extreme target wave function configurations <ref> [2] </ref>. There is also a lot of interest in charmonium interactions with nuclei. There are predictions that QCD Van der Waals force, could enhance threshold production. On a nuclear target taking 0:3 0:4 GeV of Fermi momentum, the photon energy threshold could be as low as ~ 6:5 GeV.

Charm production has proven to be a sensitive probe of production mechanisms. <p> Strong, high p T suppression comes in CSM from the hard propagators shown in Fig. 1b. It has been noted that CSM typically fails when extra gluons are required to satisfy quantum number constraints <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: production by the quantum numbers of the soft final state would in particular require taking into account soft gluons, in a popular approach, referred to as the color evaporation model (CEM), color interactions are treated in a simple way by averaging over possible final states below the open charm threshold <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In photoproduction CEM describes the data over a wide range of photon energies although its significance near threshold and at very high energies is questionable. 2 An alternative approach is to include as many hard gluons as needed to fully implement the restrictions imposed by the final state <ref> [5] </ref>. This approach is known as the color singlet model or CSM. It has been successfully applied to J= photoproduction, however it fails to reproduce the absolute normalization and large p T dependence in hadroproduction.

Reference-contexts: Thus it seems necessary to have to incorporate effects of soft gluons from the final state. This is typically done within the framework of the so called color octet mechanism <ref> [6] </ref> which takes into account color octet cc configurations. In photoproduction, however, inclusion of color octet contributions tends to overestimate the cross section and furthermore there are large uncertainties in the values of the relevant color octet matrix elements.

Reference-contexts: In this case one can show that the three subprocesses, corresponding to : photon dissociation into cc pair, cc scattering of the nucleon and formation of the bound charmonium, occur at very different time scales and thus factorize. In Ref. <ref> [7] </ref> it has been shown at at high energies the cross section grows with energy proportionally to G 2 (x = M 2 =s) i.e. faster than predicted by CEM.

Reference-contexts: One could then use the A dependence to extract N and to study ( )=(D D) to look for information on charmonium formation and nuclear rescattering effects. Preliminary studies of subthreshold production at CEBAF has been already presented at this meeting <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 Acknowledgments This research was supported by the US Department of Energy.
