Title: PIERS Timings on various Parallel Supercomputers

Abstract: PIERS is a Parallel Implicit Research Reservoir Simulator. It was made available to us as a test program, designed for experimentation rather than production, yet incorporating many features of realistic petroleum reservoir simulators. This note reports on the results of timing PIERS on five parallel supercomputers including the iNTEL Touchstone DELTA and the Connection Machine 5 (CM-5). Speedup graphs illustrate performance as a function of the number of processors for a variety of problem sizes. The results indicate that parallel computation can provide substantial speedup in reservoir simulator codes. Moreover the raw timings provide an interesting comparison of machine performance | though one must remember that they apply directly only to PIERS, and may vary with different simulators, compilers, operating systems and hardware configurations.

Reference-contexts: PIERS uses blocking sends and receives rather than the sometimes more efficient non-blocking versions. To port PIERS to a variety of parallel machines we converted it to use Express <ref> [1] </ref>, a commercially available portable communications library from ParaSoft. Timings on the iNTEL hypercube with and without Express were identical. 4 Timings and Speedups The following graphs present the timings and speedups obtained for each machine and data set, as a function of the number of processors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction PIERS is a Parallel Implicit Research Reservoir Simulator originally developed by John Wheeler and Richard Smith at Exxon Production Research Company <ref> [2] </ref>. It was made available to us as a test program, designed for experimentation rather than production, yet incorporating many features of realistic petroleum reservoir simulators. This note reports on the results of timing PIERS on five parallel supercomputers including the iNTEL Touchstone DELTA and the Connection Machine 5 (CM-5). <p> they apply directly only to PIERS, and may vary with different simulators, compilers, operating systems and hardware configurations. 2 PIERS PIERS was originally developed for the iNTEL iPSC/2 Hypercube, a 16 node machine with 1 megabyte of data storage per node, and relatively fast communications relative to its computational speed <ref> [2] </ref>. One should note that the time and space constraints of the iPSC/2 forced some design decisions which might not be optimal on other machines. We converted it to run on a variety of parallel computers and timed it on each.
