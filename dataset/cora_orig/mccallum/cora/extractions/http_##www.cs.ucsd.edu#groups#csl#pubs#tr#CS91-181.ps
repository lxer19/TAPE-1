Abstract: At the Computer Systems Laboratory at UCSD, we conduct research in distributed systems, operating systems, network protocols, and performance evaluation. This document reviews the current research within the Computer Systems Laboratory. There are four sections which describe the work of the four groups within the laboratory: Decentralized Control Research Group; Operating Systems Research Group; Communication Networks Research Group; Performance Evaluation Research Group. The final section contains descriptions of research projects undertaken by our graduate students. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This research is supported in part by the National Science Foundation, the Powell Foundation, IBM Corporation, NCR Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation, and the UC Micro Program. For more information, send mail to the authors at Computer Systems Laboratory Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0114.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that the costs of communication and the nature of the systems do not permit high bandwidth communication in making each decision. My work is influenced by the common-knowledge problem <ref> [1] </ref> which decision-makers cannot know the level of knowledge obtained by others. As a result, each decision-maker has its own view of the global state. Frequent communication decreases the uncertainty in global state but has a cost which can adversely affect the performance.

Reference-contexts: In all cases, the decisions affect the overall performance of the system and each decision-maker has an uncertainty about the decisions made by others. I have created a model called distributed game automata which is similar to learning automata <ref> [2] </ref>. Each automaton uses a probabilistic strategy, e.g. a coin, to make decisions in a game. The game payoffs represent a performance measurement of the underlying distributed system. After making a move in the game, an automaton receives feedback on the quality of its decision.

Reference-contexts: In a uniform treatment of this decision-making, the model includes a probabilistic strategy to select group membership. This allows for spontaneous coordination out of necessity similar to biological species <ref> [3] </ref>. Again, I expect to observe, and predict analytically, the communication rates that permit good decisions.
