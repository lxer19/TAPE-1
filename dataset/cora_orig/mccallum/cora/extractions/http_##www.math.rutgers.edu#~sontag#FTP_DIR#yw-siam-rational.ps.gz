Reference-contexts: One of them immediately relates to i/o equations, while the other is related to realizability through the 2 notion of observation algebras and observation fields. The latter are the analogues of the corresponding discrete-time concepts studied in [21]. For differential equations they were first employed in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]; the results there related finiteness properties of the various algebraic objects to realizability, in strict analogy to the relations that hold in discrete time ([21]). <p> Realizability. We wish to study realization by "rational" systems, such as those studied in Bartosiewicz <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the question of possible poles in the right-hand side of the equation is very delicate, and it seems better to study instead a "singular" polynomial model, as we do next.

Reference-contexts: [27] it was shown that, under some constant rank conditions, the outputs of an observable smooth state space system can be described by an equation of type (1) for which E is a smooth function, and local i/o equations were shown to exist, for generic initial states of (3), in <ref> [3] </ref>. 1.1.

Reference-contexts: The problem is basically that of in some sense replacing a nontrivial equation (1) by a system of first-order equations (3) which does not involve derivatives of the inputs. A number of results were already available about the relation between (1) and (3); see for instance <ref> [4] </ref>, [12], or [26]. It is easy to show, by elementary arguments involving finite transcendence degree, that any i/o operator realizable by a rational state space system satisfies some i/o equation of type (1), with E a polynomial.

We envision our results being used as follows (the idea is very similar to that employed in the discrete case, and explored in some detail in <ref> [5] </ref>). If there are reasons to believe that the system producing the observed data is well-posed, then an equation E may be fit to the data. We are assured that there is then a realization of the type to be considered, and we then try to find this realization.

Reference-contexts: what we will call a Fliess operator |i.e. one described by a convergent generating series| and if E is a polynomial, then it is always realizable by a singular polynomial system, or a rational system with possible poles. (Singular systems appear naturally in control theory, for instance in robotics; see <ref> [17] </ref> for many examples.) In the special case when equation (1) is recursive |i.e. the coefficient of the highest derivative of y in (1) does not depend on the lower derivatives of y,| our construction will provide a polynomial realization (no poles).

Reference-contexts: Finally, we extend our main result to families of i/o operators. This paper has a heavily algebraic flavor. All analytic properties needed are quoted from <ref> [28] </ref> and [29], and will not be proved here. <p> Assume that c and d are two convergent power series and T is admissible for both c and d, then T is admissible for both c + d and c d (cf <ref> [28] </ref>). Now for any positive integer n, denote c n = c c c | -z - ; and c 0 = 1. <p> An i/o operator F c satisfies a recursive equation if there is some such equation for which P is recursive. 2 The following Lemma was proved in <ref> [28] </ref>; a detailed proof in the more general analytic case is given in [29]. Lemma 4.3. <p> Thus P 0 (u (t); : : : ; u (k) (t); y (t); : : : ; y (k1) (t)) y (k) (t) for some polynomials P 0 and P 1 , where P 0 = 0 is not an i/o equation of F c . (See <ref> [28] </ref> for details, as well as [29] for an analogous result for result for analytic i/o equations). <p> Hence there is at least one polynomial control p 2 IR [t] such that F d [p] 6= 0. It follows from the fact that, for any t, F d [p](t) depends analytically on the coefficients of t in p (t) (cf <ref> [28] </ref>) that F d [u] 6= 0 for all polynomial controls u in a dense set of V T , which is the desired regularity property. 6. Main Results. In this section we establish the equivalence between realizability and the existence of input/output equations. <p> The following Lemma was provided in <ref> [28] </ref>: Lemma 6.3. Assume that the analytic system (40) is accessible at x 0 and that M is connected. Let c h be the series defined by (41). <p> Since each convergent series induces an i/o operator, each convergent family c of power series induces a family of i/o operators fF c : 2 flg which we denote by F c . The following result was provided in <ref> [28] </ref>. Lemma 7.4. Assume that c is a convergent family. If T is admissible for c 0 , then T is admissible for c for all in a small neighborhood of 0 , and, F c [u](t) depends (jointly) continuously on t and . 2 7.1. <p> Sometimes one imposes a "causality" constraint on i/o equations, requiring that the highest derivative of u be of lower order than derivatives of y. However, it is easy to see (cf. <ref> [28] </ref>) that for i/o behaviors described by generating series, an equation of the type (1) always leads to an equation in which the highest order of derivative of inputs is lower than the highest order of derivative of outputs, i.e., an equation of the type E u (t); u 0 (t);

Reference-contexts: We shall call them "Fliess operators". For instance, any i/o operator induced by an initialized analytic state space system affine in controls can be described in this manner.

As in [29], we denote by U T the set of all essentially bounded measurable functions u : [0; T ] !

Assume that c and d are two convergent power series and T is admissible for both c and d, then T is admissible for both c + d and c d (cf [28]). <p> Assume c is a convergent series and pick up a T admissible for c. We show in <ref> [29] </ref> that F c is a continuous operator from V T to C [0; T ] with respect to the L 1 norm in V T and the C 0 norm in C [0; T ]. <p> An i/o operator F c satisfies a recursive equation if there is some such equation for which P is recursive. 2 The following Lemma was proved in [28]; a detailed proof in the more general analytic case is given in <ref> [29] </ref>. Lemma 4.3.

(See [28] for details, as well as <ref> [29] </ref> for an analogous result for result for analytic i/o equations). <p> However, the analytic results in <ref> [29] </ref> can be applied to prove that about every singular point of the realization obtained here there is another system, locally defined in terms of analytic functions, that realizes (locally) the desired behavior.

Reference-contexts: As a final remark, we explain how this work relates to alternative foundations for systems theory recently proposed by various authors. One may consider the behavior w () = (u (); y ()) associated to an input/output description. It has been proposed by <ref> [31] </ref> that one should formulate systems modeling without a priori distinctions between input and output signals. In these terms, an input/output equation takes the form E w (t); w 0 (t); w 00 (t); : : : ; w (r) (t) = 0 :(49) One of the central questions in [31] <p> <ref> [31] </ref> that one should formulate systems modeling without a priori distinctions between input and output signals. In these terms, an input/output equation takes the form E w (t); w 0 (t); w 00 (t); : : : ; w (r) (t) = 0 :(49) One of the central questions in [31] and related work is that of in some sense partitioning an abstract behavior w () into "inputs" and "outputs." Once this task is achived, however, and provided that one may assume a suitable structure -in our case, the existence of a Fliess-operator relationship between inputs and outputs,- it is still

In frequency-domain terms, rationality of the transfer function is equivalent to realizability. (For references on the linear theory, see eg [14], [23] and <ref> [32] </ref>.) One of the methods for obtaining a linear realization from a given linear i/o equation relies on Lord Kelvin's principle for solving differential equations by means of mechanical analog computers (cf. [14]).
