Title: Extending the HPKB-Upper-Level Ontology: Experiences and Observations  
Author: Stuart Aitken 
Date: March 1998

Affiliation: AIAI, University of  
Abstract: This paper describes our experience of extending the HPKB-upper-level ontology. We argue that the documentation of design rationale, and the provision of information which allows the verification of generic ontologies are key to the re-use of this type of ontology.

Reference-contexts: This paper identifies concepts which would need to be represented in such an ontology, and shows how they can be implemented in Cyc. It has been noted that there is little methodological support for ontology development <ref> [1] </ref>, and relatively few reported studies on the extension of ontologies [13]. This paper describes our experience of extending an existing ontology in order to provide concrete examples of the issues and problems encountered. <p> It is argued that the middle-out approach avoids problems such as going into too much detail (associated with bottom-up approaches) and imposing arbitrary high-level categories (associated with top-down approaches) [12]. The Methontology approach <ref> [1] </ref> distinguishes project management, development-oriented, and support activities in ontology development. The aim of this approach is to specify a method for creating ontologies at a level above the language-encoding level.

Reference-contexts: It may be significant that they did not import all the ontologies that are included by engineering maths, but focussed on the concepts of interest. The engineering math ontology has also been re-used by Borst <ref> [2] </ref>. In this case the existing Ontolingua ontology defined one view of the PhysSys ontology; an ontology which is composed from several super-theories. Super theories include mereology, topology, and systems theory, each of which is a coherent ontology formalising concepts from an established field. <p> Importing or translating this ontology is, for most purposes, impractical due to its size. Generic ontologies also differ in the degree to which they can be validated (validation is discussed in Borst <ref> [2] </ref>). Engineering maths and topology ontologies are capable of being validated by reference to literature in their application fields. The HPKB-upper-level, Enterprise [14] and SPAR [10] ontologies do not capture knowledge in such well understood fields, therefore this form of validation is not possible. Generic ontologies typically structure terms hierarchically.

Reference-contexts: Factors are: authorship, publisher, currency, perspectives, coverage, and accuracy or verifiability. Credibility may be assessed by considering the reliability of the procedures used to produce the claim, the directness of the testimony, and other factors relating to possible bias in the report <ref> [3] </ref>. Attributes are defined as relations between information sources and collections of attribute values, and the relations are stated to generalise to hasAttributes. Predicates such as hasSubjectArea, hasAuthor and hasCredibilityRating are introduced. They specify the appropriate attribute value set as the second argument.

Reference-contexts: The HPKB-upper-level ontology, which is available from the Ontolingua server [9], is intended for use in solving the challenge problems which have been devised as technology testbeds on the DARPA High Performance Knowledge Bases (HPKB) project <ref> [6] </ref>. AIAI are part of the HPKB programme. <p> For example, the number of subset links to the upper ontology can be counted, and this figure can also be contrasted with the size of the extension to give a simple measure of how integrated or isolated the extension is. The HPKB weapons and vehicles ontologies <ref> [6] </ref> are interrelated extensions of the upper ontology. The upper ontology defines 1627 classes. The weapons ontology defines 78 new classes.

Reference-contexts: If we did not assume that language and meaning could be separated, then we would need to distinguish text-in-English from text-in-French as classes of textual material. Credibility is an important concept, particularly in relation to on-line sources <ref> [8] </ref>. Factors are: authorship, publisher, currency, perspectives, coverage, and accuracy or verifiability. Credibility may be assessed by considering the reliability of the procedures used to produce the claim, the directness of the testimony, and other factors relating to possible bias in the report [3].

Reference-contexts: A review of the existing literature on the methodology of ontology construction and re-use is presented, and, drawing on these proposals, the information sources ontology is restructured in an attempt to aid re-use. The HPKB-upper-level ontology, which is available from the Ontolingua server <ref> [9] </ref>, is intended for use in solving the challenge problems which have been devised as technology testbeds on the DARPA High Performance Knowledge Bases (HPKB) project [6]. AIAI are part of the HPKB programme. <p> The approach taken so far has focussed on understanding the upper-level ontology, and understanding implementation-level issues. The ontologies of bibliographic data and documents which have been placed on the Ontolingua server <ref> [9] </ref> have not been taken into account. These cover a more extensive range of sources than we initially attempted to capture in our limited domain. Some of the concepts in these ontologies already exist in the HPKB-upper-level ontology, but are organised in a rather different way.

Reference-contexts: Generic ontologies also differ in the degree to which they can be validated (validation is discussed in Borst [2]). Engineering maths and topology ontologies are capable of being validated by reference to literature in their application fields. The HPKB-upper-level, Enterprise [14] and SPAR <ref> [10] </ref> ontologies do not capture knowledge in such well understood fields, therefore this form of validation is not possible. Generic ontologies typically structure terms hierarchically. Terms may be grouped into work areas, but a modular structure is seldom used.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we review ontology design at the conceptual level beginning with a survey of existing methodologies. Some of the proposed techniques are then used to improve the re-usability of the information sources extension. 3 Ontology Development: Methods and Experiences A middle-out approach to ontology construction has been proposed <ref> [12] </ref>. The major steps are: scoping which includes brainstorming to produce relevant concepts; grouping concepts and cross-referencing them; producing definitions initially these will be in natural language; determining the meta-ontology; determining work areas; and defining terms in work areas in a middle-out fashion. <p> It is argued that the middle-out approach avoids problems such as going into too much detail (associated with bottom-up approaches) and imposing arbitrary high-level categories (associated with top-down approaches) <ref> [12] </ref>. The Methontology approach [1] distinguishes project management, development-oriented, and support activities in ontology development. The aim of this approach is to specify a method for creating ontologies at a level above the language-encoding level.

We then present an analysis of some of the more important issues which arise in the re-use of ontologies which define a generic upper-level conceptualisation. <p> Terms may be drawn from other ontologies. Each concept classification tree is documented by a number of tables, and 6 the ODE tool provides user support for the lifecycle of ontology development. The experience of re-using the engineering math ontology from Ontolingua has been reported on <ref> [13] </ref>. The processes followed were: to identify the kernel to be reused, re-express these concepts in the required language, then to refine the specification and verify its correctness. The aim of this work was to define physical quantities and dimensions, and, thereby, to perform dimensional analysis.
