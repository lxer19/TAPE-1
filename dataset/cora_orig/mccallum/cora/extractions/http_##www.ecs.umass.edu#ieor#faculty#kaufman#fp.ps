Abstract: This research was supported in part by the University of Michigan ITS Center. Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003-5220 Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2117 System Engineering Division, The MITRE Corporation, 600 Maryland Avenue S.W., Suite 755, Washington, DC 20024 The paper considers the problem of dynamic traffic assignment under the principle that individual drivers will choose fastest paths, in the dynamic situation where path durations consist of time-dependent link travel times. Rather than constructing a unified model encompassing traffic dynamics and route choice, we decompose the model into an assignment mapping, which identifies the link travel times resulting from an input routing policy, and a routing mapping, which yields fastest-path routings associated with input link travel times. Since time-dynamic link travel times are influenced by route choice, this dynamic situation therefore encompasses predictive routing strategies. We establish that user-equilibrium routing policies are fixed points of the composition of the routing and assignment functions. After discussing difficulties associated with establishing existence of fixed points under discrete-time modeling and all-or-nothing routing, we present instead new iterative routing mappings for continuous-time multipath routing (the splitting of a single-class flow onto multiple paths), which adjust routing policies more incrementally. We provide sufficient conditions for existence of fixed points in various routing policy domains and offer some suggestions on the computation of these fixed-point policies.

Reference-contexts: This condition models drivers behaving noncooperatively with perfect information about the available route choices. When traffic conditions are considered constant over time, the situation is one of static user equilibrium, which has been studied extensively (see, e.g., <ref> [1, 10, 14] </ref>). On the other hand, the problem of dynamic user equilibrium, where traffic conditions change over time, has a variety of formulations and a lack of unifying results.

Reference-contexts: See appendix. The applicability of Theorem 3 to computation is unclear, because the proof relies on giving the Cartesian product topology over its indices, including uncountably many time points in . This topology is therefore not metrizable (cf. <ref> [9, 2.10] </ref>). In other words, there exists no distance function in which is compatible with this existence theorem. This will hinder efforts to prove that a proposed algorithm converges to a fixed point.

Reference-contexts: This would imply that successive approximation converges to a fixed point from any starting point, and incidentally that this fixed point is unique (cf. <ref> [12] </ref>). To enable the application of this property or other metric analyses, we will impose a number of additional restrictions. First, we must consider only those routing policies in for which each routing split vector varies continuously over time.
