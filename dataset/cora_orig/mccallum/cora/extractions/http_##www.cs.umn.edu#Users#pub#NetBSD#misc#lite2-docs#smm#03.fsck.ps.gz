Abstract: File System Check Program (fsck) is an interactive file system check and repair program. Fsck uses the redundant structural information in the UNIX file system to perform several consistency checks. If an inconsistency is detected, it is reported to the operator, who may elect to fix or ignore each inconsistency. These inconsistencies result from the permanent interruption of the file system updates, which are performed every time a file is modified. Unless there has been a hardware failure, fsck is able to repair corrupted file systems using procedures based upon the order in which UNIX honors these file system update requests. The purpose of this document is to describe the normal updating of the file system, to discuss the possible causes of file system corruption, and to present the corrective actions implemented by fsck. Both the program and the interaction between the program and the operator are described.
