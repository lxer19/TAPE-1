Title: Contact Transition Control of a Single Flexible Link Using Positive Acceleration Feedback

Abstract: The ability to control a robot in both constrained and unconstrained situations is important. One way to do this is using a switching controller which uses a force controller for constrained space and a position controller for unconstrained space. This paper develops a switching controller for a single flexible link manipulator and provides experimental results for a motion from unconstrained to constrained space. The effect of different levels of positive acceleration feedback on the force response, after a collision with an unexpected object occurs, is examined. It is concluded that small amounts of positive acceleration feedback reduces the force overshoot caused by the collision but that too much can cause instability.

In the papers by Chiou and Shahinpoor <ref> [3] </ref> and Fan and Castelazo [5], control of a flexible robot with a force / torque sensor on the end effector is examined. In Choi and Krishnamurthy [4], a set of linear time varying equations are derived for a flexible robot in both constrained and unconstrained spaces.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the flexible beam may come into contact with the object at a location other than the tip, or the beam may bounce on and off the object, making the use of pinned-pinned boundary conditions difficult. In Matsuno et. al. <ref> [8] </ref>, it is shown that the boundary conditions for the flexible beam in contact with the environment depend on the contact force and input torque, as well as the contact position. This makes the flexible beam equations very difficult to solve and simplifications must be made. <p> This increases the order of the system to be controlled. The approach used by Matsuno et. al. <ref> [8] </ref> makes several assumptions based on the static relationship between the elastic deformations and the contact force which simplify the boundary conditions enough to allow a solution to the equations of motion.

The proof in [10] assumes that a rigid body PID position controller is used with an implicit force controller to form the switching controller.

Reference-contexts: Separate LQR / LTR controllers were designed for specific times and control was switched between them. This required that the exact position of the object be known a priori and only simulation results were provided. In Pfeiffer <ref> [11] </ref>, the feedforward torques to provide an optimal trajectory are computed offline, while the vibrations in the flexible link are reduced online using a PD controller on the rigid body variables and a proportional controller on the beam curvature. <p> The ARX method, which is based on the Least Squares Algorithm, was used to generate an eighth order model for the single flexible link in contact with a rigid environment. The model has the motor voltage as its input and force of contact as its output. As in Pfeiffer <ref> [11] </ref>, strain gauges were used to measure the force of contact.

Reference-contexts: Since the position of the object / manipulator contains some error the manipulator will contact the environment, and switch to force control, with a nonzero velocity. This results in an impact impulse force and could cause the manipulator to bounce off of the environment. In Tarn et. al. <ref> [15] </ref> this problem is looked at for rigid manipulators. They propose adding a positive acceleration feedback term to the force control law. This is shown to reduce the impact force and the chance of bouncing. They also show that it improves the force response for different environments. <p> estimator which is used for the force control part of the switching controller [10]. 4 Positive Acceleration Feedback To reduce the overshoot in the force response of the system after a collision with the environment has occurred, the use of positive acceleration feedback was proposed by Tarn et. al. in <ref> [15] </ref> for rigid robots. <p> The presence of the second derivative terms means that the rigid body response may be highly oscillatory, which would make the force response oscillatory as well. According to <ref> [15] </ref>, it is quite difficult to choose values for the controller gains which eliminate the overshoot and rigid body oscillations. Furthermore, these values will be highly dependent on the stiffness of the environment [15]. To overcome these two problems they propose adding a positive acceleration term to the feedback. <p> According to <ref> [15] </ref>, it is quite difficult to choose values for the controller gains which eliminate the overshoot and rigid body oscillations. Furthermore, these values will be highly dependent on the stiffness of the environment [15]. To overcome these two problems they propose adding a positive acceleration term to the feedback. <p> Therefore, if the manipulator trajectory eventually remains in either the constrained or unconstrained regions, the system will be stable. However, there is the possibility for instability if the manipulator bounces between the two regions an infinite number of times. In Tarn et. al. <ref> [15] </ref>, a proof is given which establishes some constraints on the position and force controller gains for a rigid robot, which eliminates the possibility of an infinite number of switches. Thus stability is guaranteed. This proof has been extended to a single flexible link in [10] with some restrictive assumptions.
