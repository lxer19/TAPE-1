Reference-contexts: Wirsing defined the notion of thin bases; A is thin bases of order h if A (x) &lt; c 0 x 1=h ; (c 0 &gt; 0). By a non-constructive method Wirsing proved <ref> [1] </ref> that S has a subbases S 0 which is almost thin, proving S 0 (x) = O (x 1=4 (log x) 1=4 ). Later J. Spencer [2] gave a short proof for it, using an important tool of probabilistic method, the Janson's inequality.

We merely mention it is not even known an explicit subsequence S 0 of S for which S 0 (x) = o ( x).

Reference-contexts: Further he proved in [7] that for every k the sequence fn k : n 2 Ng is complete. A far-reaching generalization of Birch's and Sprague's results was published by J. W. Cassels (see <ref> [4] </ref> and (5)). This result gives in the general case that the sequence G is complete.

Reference-contexts: Erd-os conjectured and Birch proved that B (p; q) is complete sequence (see <ref> [5] </ref>). By the irrationality of (log p= log q) we infer that the quotient of consecutive terms of this sequence tends to 1 . Finally the completeness of sequences type (8) were investigated by many authors. <p> But if we omit at least two elements from then the remaining sequence cannot be complete (see <ref> [5] </ref>). - 5 -
