Title: An Information Extraction Core System for Real World German Text Processing  
Author: Gunter Neumann Rolf Backofen Judith Baur Markus Becker Christian Braun 
Abstract: This paper describes SMES, an information extraction core system for real world German text processing. The basic design criterion of the system is of providing a set of basic powerful, robust, and efficient natural language components and generic linguistic knowledge sources which can easily be customized for processing different tasks in a flexible manner.

Reference-contexts: Actually, the extensions concern * the use of tries (see <ref> (Aho et al., 1983) </ref>) as the sole storage device for all sorts of lexical information in mona (e.g., for lexical entries, prefix, inflectional endings) , and * the analysis of compound expressions which is realized by means of a recursive trie traversal.

Reference-contexts: For example the recognition part for simple nominal phrases might be defined as follows: (:conc (:starn (:mona-cat "det" det) 1) 4 Brill reports a 96% accuracy using a training set of 350.000 words and 1729 rules. However, he does not handle unknown words. In <ref> (Aone and Hausman, 1996) </ref>, an extended version of Brill's tagger is used for tagging Spanish texts, which includes unknown words.

Reference-contexts: This allows for the definition of cascaded as well as interleaved flow of control. The former case means that it is possible to apply a cascade of finite state expressions (comparable to that proposed in <ref> (Appelt et al., 1993) </ref>), and the latter supports the definition of finite state expressions which incrementally perform a mix of keyword spotting, fragment processing, and template instantiation. 1 The system has already successfully been applied to classifying event announcements made via email, scheduling of meetings also sent via email, and extraction <p> them in a list : (compile-regexp (:star (:alt (:seek gen-phrase x) (:var dummy))) :output-desc (build-item :type list :out x ) :prefix T :suffix NIL :name gen-star) Additionally, a boolean parameter can be used to specify whether longest or shortest matches should be prefered (the default is longest match, see also <ref> (Appelt et al., 1993) </ref> where also longest subsuming phrases are prefered). 5 Fragment combination and template generation Bidirectional shallow parsing The combination of extracted fragments is performed by a lexical-driven bidirectional shallow parser which operates on fragment combination patterns FCP which are attached to lexical entries (mainly verbs).

Reference-contexts: entries), and an excellent speed (5000 words/sec without compound handling, 2800 words/sec with compound processing (where for each compound all lexically possible decompositions are computed). 2 Part-of-speech disambiguation Morphological ambiguous readings are disambiguated wrt. part-of-speech using case-sensitive rules 3 and filtering rules which have been determined using Brill's unsupervised tagger <ref> (Brill, 1995) </ref>. The filtering rules are also used for tagging unknown words. The filtering rules are determined on the basis of unannotated corpora. Starting from untagged corpora, mona is used for initial tagging, where unknown words are ambiguously tagged as noun, verb, and adjective.

Reference-contexts: In (1) smes is embedded in the cosma system, a German language server for existing appointment scheduling agent systems (see <ref> (Busemann et al., 1997) </ref>, this volume, for more information). In case (2) additional FST for the text structure have been added, since the text structure is an important source for the location of relevant information.

Reference-contexts: The goal of IE is to build systems that find and link relevant information from text data while ignoring extraneous and irrelevant information (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996).

Reference-contexts: Morphological processing follows text scanning and performs inflection, and processing of compounds. The capability of efficiently processing compounds is crucial since compounding is a very productive process of the German language.

In this paper we report on smes an information extraction core system for real world German text processing. The main research topics we are concerned with include easy portability and adaptability of the core system to extraction tasks of different complexity and domains.
