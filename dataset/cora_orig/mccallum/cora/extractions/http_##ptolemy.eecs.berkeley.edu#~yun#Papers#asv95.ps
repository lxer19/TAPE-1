Abstract: Wireless access to continuous-media (CM) services such as video, voice, and audio is becoming increasingly prevalent. Interactive video services such as video conferencing and multimedia editing are two such services of particular interest. We discuss some of the problems with using the MPEG standard (which was designed for wired, circuit-switched services) for wireless packet-video transport in a mobile environment. We propose a novel strategy for video transport using a layered source coder in conjunction with a variable QOS, multiple-substream abstraction for the transport. This abstraction addresses specifically the need to obtain simultaneously high spectral efficiency, good subjective quality, and low perceptual delay on a wireless channel. It also addresses the heterogenous transport resulting from the concatenation of a wireless access link with a broad-band backbone network. We use asynchronous video (ASV) reconstruction, running counter to current techniques, which use strictly synchronous (frame-by-frame) video processing. By doing so, we hope to achieve a perceptual delay that is much lower than the worst-case transport delay. By perceptual delay, we refer to the effective end-to-end latency observed by the user, for example as represented by the audio delay required to maintain lip synchronization. By identifying packets to the transport with relaxed reliability and/or delay requirements, the transport (particularly wireless) can achieve high traf

Reference-contexts: That is, how does the network recognize which information elements have relaxed delay requirements? Furthermore, once the network has identified these elements, how does it use this information to reduce perceptual delay and increase traffic capacity?

Asynchronous Video 7 3.1 Syntactical constraints In the realization of CM services, as distinct from other services, there are three critical signal processing technologies: compression, forward error-correction coding (FEC), and encryption. <p> Thus, we believe the edge architecture is superior to the link architecture and it should be adopted for the future. 3.3 Substream abstraction of transport One of the key features of <ref> [1] </ref> that embodies many of the ideas discussed above is its substream abstraction for the transport network. Figure 2 illustrates this abstraction. 10 Chapter 1 For a particular audio or video stream, the transport provisions substreams (through a link-layer protocol). <p> We believe that this opportunity has the greatest significance on wireless access links, although (as noted before) we propose to use this video coding technique transparently across the entire edge-to-edge connection to avoid extra delay (and other problems <ref> [1] </ref>) introduced by transcoders. 5.2 ASV codec design In this section we give a general description of our ASV codec that serves as a framework for future designs.

Reference-contexts: At all other operating points, the gain in capacity is strictly greater than unity, as shown in Figure 3. Finally, let us look at a specific numerical example. Let the substream delay requirements be 30, 60 and 90 ms respectively, and let <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] </ref> = [0:2; 0:35; 0:45]. If the delay-limited capacity of a substream-less system is no substreams = 0:1, then the load capacity of a system utilizing substreams is substreams = 0:2 | a twofold gain in capacity. <p> On a wireless link, a substream's reliability requirement is mapped onto a desired signal-to-interference noise ratio (SNR). The capacity of a wireless multiple-access link is interference-limited in the sense that in order for the substream reliability requirements to be satisfied, the following condition must hold at any time <ref> [3] </ref>: X all users k f (SN R any substream of user k ) &lt; 1 ; (1.12) where f (x) is a monotonic function in x. Specifically, (1.6) must hold when all users simultaneously transmit their maximum SNR substreams.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the traffic capacity of wireless multiple access schemes such as code-division multiple access (CDMA), and wireless cellular systems in general, are not just bandlimited, but interference-limited as well <ref> [4] </ref>. It is therefore beneficial to transmit the minimum power necessary to support a given reliability for a substream, as this creates the least interference to other users. <p> This squanders power and increases interference. With the application of substreams, power allocation can be fine-tuned, thereby maximizing the interference-limited capacity of a wireless subnet <ref> [4] </ref>. We have seen that providing variable reliability via the substream abstraction can lead to network capacity gain.

There are hybrid cases, such as convolutional coding with soft decoding, which we lump into the signal-space category. Since encryption, like binary coding, transforms one bit stream into another, it can precede or follow binary error-correction coding.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the telephone network, in a call from a wired to a digital cellular telephone, one voice coding technique (8 kHz sampled PCM) is used on the wired network and another (VSELP in the case of the North American IS-54 standard) is used on the digital cellular subnet <ref> [7] </ref>. This is for valid and important technical reasons; namely, the desire for spectral efficiency on the digital cellular subnet, resulting in more aggressive compression (traded off against implementation cost and reduced subjective quality) and the need for joint source/channel coding.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to achieve a perceptual delay that is representative of the lowest-delay substream, rather than the highest-delay substream. We define asynchronous video (ASV) as video coding for substream transport, where we decode the video presentation for display without re-synchronization of the substreams <ref> [8] </ref>. stream into substreams by segregated the semantic components of the stream into three classes: high motion, low motion, and no (or very low) motion. For example, the semantic components might be 8x8 blocks of pixels, where each block represents a particular spatial region in one frame of video. <p> Here, we emphasize the substream partitioning and asynchronous reconstruction of video, rather than the specific signal processing of each component. (See <ref> [8] </ref> for details on one such realization.) We discuss results of an actual software implementation in the next section. frames are first processed through a transformation component, which transforms the image into a suitable domain (e.g., frequency domain via subband coding) and representation (i.e., transformed-image blocks). <p> The ASV codec used for each simulation was based on subband decomposition with scalar quantization of subband coefficients <ref> [8] </ref>. 6.1 Perceptual delay To measure the perceptual delay, we used a 15 frames per second talking-heads sequence, which we refer to as SEQ. This sequence has significant high-motion content (i.e., head and lip movements), low-motion content (i.e., a slowly p anning overlay), and stationary content (i.e., a motionless background).

Reference-contexts: MP EG : (1.5) If the BER is small, we can approximate (1.5) by BER 1=B N For BER MP EG = 10 12 , a round-trip delay of 30ms, an interactive delay bound of 100ms, and a packet size of 188 bytes (the size of an MPEG2 transport packet <ref> [14] </ref>), the ideal SR protocol would require a BER of approximately 10 7 or lower. The BER requirement would have to be achieved by applying FEC to the unconditioned channel. This hybrid ARQ/FEC scheme has the following implications: By use of ARQ, we have lightened the burden on FEC considerably.
