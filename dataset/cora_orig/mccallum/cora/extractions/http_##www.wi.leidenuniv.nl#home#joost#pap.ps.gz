Abstract: More and more data about consumer-behaviour is becoming available through the use of database systems and electronic-banking systems. In this paper we describe a NN-based technique to extract some useful information from a database holding data about customers of an insurance-company. Using this NN, we try to learn more about the needs and wishes that lead consumers towards specific behaviour, so that better service can be provided in the future. We formulate a more formal version of this problem, describe the NN used, and show results on artificial and real data.

Reference-contexts: An example of a `fit vs. number of dimensions'-plot clearly showing an elbow is given in figure (2). A very similar procedure for obtaining the number of underlying dimensions is often used in Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (see e.g. [5]). In the context of the latter technique, the `fit vs. number of dimensions'-plot is often called `scree plot'. Fig. 2: A `fit vs. number of dimensions'-plot showing a clear elbow at four dimensions. 4. Results on Artificial Data.

Reference-contexts: The Competitive Neural Network The neural network we used was inspired by simple competitive neural networks (see e.g. <ref> [2, 3] </ref>). Every customer and every alternative in our system was represented in this network by a competitive unit. The weight-vectors of the units corresponded with the v-coordinates of the customers and product-alternatives.
