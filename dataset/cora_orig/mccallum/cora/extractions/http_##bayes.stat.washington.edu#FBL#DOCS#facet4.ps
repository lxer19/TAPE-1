Abstract: We describe Facet-Based Learning (FBL) for undergraduate statistic education. This instructional methodology attempts to bridge the gap between students knowledge and experts knowledge by making students prior knowledge and understandings explicit and then facilitating student progress towards expert-like behavior. Researchers and teachers developed FBL in the context of high school physics, and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of FBL in that setting. Application of FBL to large undergraduate classes requires extensive computing support. We have developed WorldWide Web-based computing tools and evaluated both the tools and FBL as a whole. Our results suggest that both FBL and the computing tools are effective at the college level.

Reference-contexts: Early research labeled many of these ideas misconceptions or naive views and implied or directly stated that the purpose of instruction was to stamp them out <ref> (see, for example, Blosser, 1987) </ref>. We argue, however, that their ideas do work in appropriate contexts. After all, students play basketball, drive cars, play card games, predict journey times and successfully engage in problem solvingand interact with the physical world all the time.

Reference-contexts: Bruer (1993), Glaser (1988), Resnick (1984) and others have argued forcefully that to improve teaching and learning in our schools and colleges, We will have to apply what we have learned from three decades of research on how the human mind works. <ref> (Bruer, 1993) </ref>. Cognitive research provides critical insights into the learning process; our goal is to harness this research to design effective instruction for undergraduate statistics.

Reference-contexts: Facets provide a powerful foundation upon which build student models. The grain size of the facets is such that 21 once an instructor diagnoses a student has having a particular facet, targeted instruction follows easily. This idea underlies our construction of VITAL, an intelligent tutoring system for statistics <ref> (Madigan et al., 1994, Clarkson et al., 1994) </ref>. For student modeling, VITAL uses Bayesian graphical models with nodes corresponding to facets and links corresponding to conditional dependencies between facets.

Reference-contexts: The students realization of their acquisition of knowledge is what makes the benchmark memorable. In contrast to a misconceptions orientation, benchmark lessons count heavily on the productive contribution of a students ideas <ref> (Clement et al., 1989) </ref>. The process of ferreting out pieces of prior conceptualizations and framing them in discussions to be maximally helpful is at the core of preparing and running benchmark lessons. diSessa and Minstrell (1995) offer the following maxims for benchmarks: 9 1.

Reference-contexts: Devise DIANA questions for the facets and carry out a protocol analysis with a sample of students using DIANA. A protocol analysis consists an online verbal description of what people are doing-what they are thinking about, what actions they are planning-while they solve a problem or complete a task <ref> (McGilly, 1994) </ref>. It serves to identify new facets as well as indicating problems with DIANA content and design. To date we have identified over 200 facets for the descriptive statistics, probability, and basic inference modules of an introductory statistics course.
