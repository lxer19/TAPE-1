Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Task assignment problem is defined as mapping tasks of a parallel program onto processors of a host multiprocessor system such that the program gets executed with minimal time <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. If the number of tasks exceeds the number of processors, the assignment phase is preceded by a clustering phase [5, 8, 9, 12, 18]. On distributed-memory systems, some messages need to travel longer paths depending on the distance between the communicating processors. <p> Hence, the assignment phase must consider the unequal distances between processors and link contention in obtaining an efficient solution. Previous research related to the assignment problem has modeled a distributed-memory program as task interaction graph <ref> [1, 8, 13] </ref>. These graphs only capture volume of communication between tasks and ignore the temporal information (when message communication occurs and by how much) completely. Some researchers [1, 13] have considered link contention for restricted cases of programs when communication between all tasks is synchronized. <p> Previous research related to the assignment problem has modeled a distributed-memory program as task interaction graph [1, 8, 13]. These graphs only capture volume of communication between tasks and ignore the temporal information (when message communication occurs and by how much) completely. Some researchers <ref> [1, 13] </ref> have considered link contention for restricted cases of programs when communication between all tasks is synchronized.

In recent years, the communication architecture of distributed-memory systems is undergoing rapid advances. <p> These graphs can correspond to either SPMD or MPMD distributed-memory programs with arbitrary asynchronous communication patterns. We use a new graph-theoretic model, the Temporal Communication Graph (TCG), which is a hybrid of both precedence [12, 17] and the interaction models <ref> [1, 8, 13] </ref>. Temporal information on task computation and communication available from a TCG is used in identifying (a) link contention between spatially and temporally conflicting message transmissions and (b) critical messages. These messages, forming the critical execution path of the program determine the program completion time.

Reference-contexts: As a result, on these systems, link contention has severe impact on message latency than the distance it has to travel. Hence, it is increasingly becoming important to take link contention into account while mapping problems onto wormhole-routed systems <ref> [2] </ref>. As wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend for building future distributed-memory systems, researchers are proposing deadlock-free routing schemes with varying adaptivity to improve system throughput. The adaptivity directly affect link contention and hence completion time of a parallel application.

Reference-contexts: The adaptivity directly affect link contention and hence completion time of a parallel application. Deterministic (also known as e-cube or oblivious) routing [4] allows a message to take a fixed path from a given source to its destination. On the other hand, adaptive routing strategies (partially-adaptive <ref> [3] </ref> and fully adaptive [7]) permit messages to take alternate paths while avoiding the busy links. Such adaptivity has potential to reduce link contention between messages conflicting 1 temporally and spatially over some common links. <p> Fully adaptive algorithms allow a message to be routed along any of the shaortest paths from the source to the destination processor while partially adaptive algorithms restrict routing freedom. Figure 1b shows planar routing proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> which limits routing freedom to two dimensions at a time. It is thus partially adaptive for topologies with dimension greater than 2. Figure 1c shows how fully adaptive routing [7] can provide more edge-disjoint paths between two processors. <p> The focus was to determine up to what extent these factors impose or relax constraints on using optimal assignment heuristic. 7.1 Host system and TCG parameters We considered wormhole-routed systems with varying degree of adaptivity. Three different routing algorithms, e-cube (least adaptive), planar adaptive <ref> [3] </ref> (partially adaptive for 3 and higher dimensional systems), and fully adaptive [7], were considered. All these algorithms support message transfer over minimal path. We considered 64-processor system organized as either 8x8-mesh or 6-dimensional hypercube. Since planar routing ensures full adaptivity for meshes, we excluded it in our experiments.

Reference-contexts: However, there is no solution for assignment problem for general task graphs by taking link contention into account. In recent years, the communication architecture of distributed-memory systems is undergoing rapid advances. There is an increasing use of wormhole routing switching technique <ref> [4] </ref> in current generation multicomputers (nCUBE-2, iWarp, and Intel's Paragon) due to its communication efficiency over store-and-forward and circuit-switched routing. In wormhole routing, the header flit of a message establishes the path, intermediate flits follow the path, and the tail flit releases the path. <p> As wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend for building future distributed-memory systems, researchers are proposing deadlock-free routing schemes with varying adaptivity to improve system throughput.

Reference-contexts: If the number of tasks exceeds the number of processors, the assignment phase is preceded by a clustering phase <ref> [5, 8, 9, 12, 18] </ref>. On distributed-memory systems, some messages need to travel longer paths depending on the distance between the communicating processors. In addition, paths taken by messages may not always be edge-disjoint. This leads to link contention amongst messages traveling simultaneously over the same links. <p> We assume the number of tasks to be equal to the number of processors and address the problem of assignment of tasks onto specific topology. In a separate paper <ref> [5] </ref>, we have solved the clustering problem for general distributed-memory systems. We address the assignment problem for general task graphs that can be regular or irregular. These graphs can correspond to either SPMD or MPMD distributed-memory programs with arbitrary asynchronous communication patterns. <p> Section 8 discusses conclusions and future work. 2 2 Preliminaries For the assignment problem on distributed-memory systems, our approach uses the Temporal Communication Graph (TCG) model for designing heuristics. This model captures temporal information of a program execution. In <ref> [5] </ref>, we have presented the suitability of TCG model over the precedence and interaction models for solving partitioning, clustering, and/or assignment problems for distributed-memory system. The TCG model was introduced and used by Lo [14] to obtain phase expressions for regular parallel programs. <p> Nodes with no incoming edges are called source nodes and those with no outgoing edges are called sink nodes of the TCG. Figure 2 shows TCG representation for Gaussian elimination example clustered for m = 4 processors by Min-Completion clustering heuristic proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. In the TCG, for example, node v 12 represents computation stage 2 of task T 1 . The amount of computation done in v 12 is 50 and 4 The ideal computation occurrence time estimates without link contention and resulting critical path are shown for the identity task-processor assignment.

Reference-contexts: The above temporal information forms the basis in developing our assignment heuristics. These heuristics are general and applicable to any system topology implementing minimal (a message always taking a minimal distance path) routing. The interplay of message-ordering strategy <ref> [6] </ref> on program completion time is also analyzed. The assignment heuristics are verified through simulation experiments performed on random task graphs. The interplay between (a) degree of routing adaptivity, (b)topology, and (c) application characteristics is observed through these experiments.

It is thus partially adaptive for topologies with dimension greater than 2. Figure 1c shows how fully adaptive routing <ref> [7] </ref> can provide more edge-disjoint paths between two processors. Higher adaptivity reduces message contentions and hence the overall completion time of a 3 program. However, as adaptivity increases, hardware cost to maintain deadlock freedom increases. <p> Three different routing algorithms, e-cube (least adaptive), planar adaptive [3] (partially adaptive for 3 and higher dimensional systems), and fully adaptive <ref> [7] </ref>, were considered. All these algorithms support message transfer over minimal path. We considered 64-processor system organized as either 8x8-mesh or 6-dimensional hypercube.

Reference-contexts: Below, we briefly review three common routing algorithms, with different adaptivity, proposed by the researchers. A routing is minimal if the path selected is one of the shortest paths between the source and destination processor. Deterministic or oblivious routing used in <ref> [10, 11, 15] </ref> defines a single path from a source to a destination node and thus has zero adaptivity. Such routing is simple to implement and deadlock free. However, it does not make effective use of all communication links in a system. <p> The units of measurements for hcomp and hcomm need to be same in order to combine computation and communication cost directly. We assume that the host architecture supports concurrent computation and communication, which is common in present-day systems <ref> [10] </ref>. In this paper, without loss of generality, we assume that contention for injection and consumption channels are negligible. Systems are assumed to support a multiport communication model so that a processor can perform communication on all its incoming and outgoing links simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: It can be noted that a node can start execution only after all messages that it is waiting for, have reached the destination processor. For our paper, we obtain A EST, A EFT, and MRT measures by executing a TCG on a process-oriented discrete-event simulator written in CSIM <ref> [19] </ref>. Figure 3 shows the actual occurrence estimates for the example TCG. The actual completion time of the corresponding program is 610. <p> Hence, we only made comparisons between the performance of Simple and MMC heuristics. The actual program completion time and link contention, used by the heuristics to determine critical communication edges, were obtained by by executing a TCG on a process-oriented discrete-event simulator written in CSIM <ref> [19] </ref>. This simulator supports flit-level message transfer and models the communication architecture of a wormhole-routed system accurately, including demand multiplexing over virtual channels.
