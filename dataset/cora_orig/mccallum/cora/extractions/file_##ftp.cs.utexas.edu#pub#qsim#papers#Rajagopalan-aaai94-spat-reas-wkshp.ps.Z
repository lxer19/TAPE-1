Abstract: The representation of the shape of an object is the foundation of any theory of spatial reasoning. Many spatial representations have been developed which use simplifying abstractions to approximate the actual shapes of objects. A limitation of these methods is that the abstractions themselves are mathematical entities, making them less useful for solving problems where only qualitative descriptions of the initial state are available. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using shape abstractions and present our spatial representation, which, unlike the previously developed methods, requires only qualitative information to describe and maintain, even in dynamically changing worlds.

A common starting point is the representation of the spatial extent of an object. <p> When knowledge of exact shapes is unnecessary, simplifying shape abstractions have been used. For example, Kuipers <ref> [Kuipers and Levitt 88] </ref> uses a point-based representation to describe the position of objects in a topological map. In our work, we consider problems which require reasoning about the properties of two and three dimensional objects, such as intersection and containment.

Reference-contexts: For example, the field (f) bounding-abstraction-encloses the loop (l) if (lm (f) lm (l)) ^ (rm (f) rm (l)) ^ tm (f ) tm (l)) ^ We define the orientation of a surface of an object through its surface normal direction <ref> [Nielsen 88] </ref>. In our representation, this may be obtained through knowledge of the identities of the extremal points between which a surface lies.

Reference-contexts: Orientation information is inferred directly from knowledge of the connectivity of an object and its extremal points. The representation can be described and maintained in a qualitative fashion, even if objects are allowed to translate and rotate. The representation has been used in a magnetic fields problems solving application <ref> [Rajagopalan 94] </ref> and in a diagram and text interpretation application [Rajagopalan 94a]. 7 Acknowledgements I thank Professor Benjamin Kuipers for his many suggestions in developing the ideas presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Further, the theories do not specify how the regions of the half-planes or the collision parallelograms can be recomputed with only qualitative information if the underlying objects are allowed to rotate. 3 The Magnetic Fields Problem Solver In our work, we address qualitative problems from the magnetic fields domain <ref> [Resnick and Halliday 88] </ref> whose solutions require integrated spatial and dynamic reasoning about dynamically changing worlds where objects are free to translate and rotate. Our problems cover the basic principles of operation of such commonly used devices as motors, generators, and transformers.

Freksa [1992] shows that, in general, the problem is underconstrained if only qualitative information is available about the positions of objects. The CITYTOUR project <ref> [Retz-Schmidt 88] </ref> uses rectangular bounding boxes drawn around the intrinsic fronts of objects to define forward, backward, left, and right half-planes with respect to a given object.
