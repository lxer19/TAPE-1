Title: A New Algorithm to Find a Point in Every Cell Defined by a Family of Polynomials  
Author: Saugata Basu Richard Pollack Marie-Fran~coise Roy 
Date: November 3, 1995  
Abstract: We consider s polynomials P 1 ; : : :; P s in k &lt; s variables with coefficients in an ordered domain A contained in a real closed field R, each of degree at most d. We present a new algorithm which computes a point in each connected component of each non-empty sign condition over P 1 ; : : : ; P s . The output is the set of points together with the sign condition at each point. The algorithm uses s(s=k) k d O(k) arithmetic operations in A. The algorithm is nearly optimal in the sense that the size of the output can be as large as s(O(sd=k)) k . Previous algorithms of Canny and Renegar used (sd) O(k) operations [5, 7, 8, 15]. We use either these algorithms in the case s = 1 as a subroutine in our algorithm. As a bonus, our algorithm yields an independent proof of the bound on the number of connected components in all non-empty sign conditions ([14]) and also yields an independent proof of a theorem of Warren

Reference-contexts: We know that D Rh 1 ;ffi;ffi 0 ;*i is again semi-algebraic and bounded. Since the image under eval of a bounded semi- algebraically connected set (defined over A [; ffi; ffi 0 ; *]) is again semi-algebraically connected, (see <ref> [12] </ref>) it is clear that eval (D Rh 1 ;ffi;ffi 0 ;*i ) is contained in C Rh 1 ;ffii . 2 The correctness of the algorithm is now an easy consequence of Proposition 1, since by Lemma 2, it suffices to consider sets of polynomials of size &lt; k +

Reference-contexts: 0 = 0 we get, being slightly more specific, an algorithm evaluating the signs of a family of s polynomials at a finite set of points defined by ` polynomials in time sd O (k) This is a multivariate version of the Ben-Or Kozen Reif algorithm improving the complexity of <ref> [13] </ref>. We plan to use the methods in this paper in order to describe a new quantifier elimination algorithm of single exponential complexity when the number of alternation of quantifiers is fixed.

Reference-contexts: Step 5: Characterize the coordinates of these points using Thom's lemma and determine at these points the sign of the other polynomials P i 2 P (using the algorithms RAN and RANSI in <ref> [16] </ref>). Note that now all polynomials are univariate with coefficients in A [; ffi; ] (again, recall items 1, 2, 3 of the introduction). In practical applications, it might be useful to check as a first step, whether the given polynomials are in general position. <p> So the total number of points constructed will be (O (sd=k) k . The Thom characterization and sign evaluation of the other polynomials at these points is done with complexity sd O (k) (using the variant of Ben-Or Kozen Reif algorithm that is algorithm RAN and RANSI in <ref> [16] </ref> ). 2.4 Generalizations In a forthcoming paper [2] we show that 11 Theorem 2 Let V be a k 0 dimensional variety which is the zero set of the polynomial Q 2 A [X 1 ; : : : X k ] and Q has degree at most d.
