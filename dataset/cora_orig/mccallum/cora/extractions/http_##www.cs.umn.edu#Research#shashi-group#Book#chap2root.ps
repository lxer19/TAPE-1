Reference-contexts: The purpose of a database design model is to offer constructs for the efficient storage, retrieval and manipulation of data. In database design, it is customary to organize data information using a three-step process <ref> [Elmasri and Navathe, 1989] </ref>. The first step is a concise description of the users' needs expressed using "diagram tools" like a box and arrow or some other simple visual paradigm. The idea is to identify key invariants or links within the data application as well as the relationships between them.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the function field which maps the spatial framework into an attribute domain, field operations map fields onto other fields. Examples of field operations are addition, `+' and composition, ffi: f + g : x ! f (x) + g (x) Field operations can be classified into three categories <ref> [Worboys, 1995] </ref>: Local operations For a local operation the value of the new field at a given location in the spatial framework is only dependent on the value of the input field at that location. <p> Touch is an example of a topological property and the study of transformations (deformations) which preserve topological properties is called Topology. The area of a polygon is clearly not a topological property. In Table 2.2.1 we list some common topological and non-topological properties <ref> [Worboys, 1995] </ref>. From a spatial/geographic database point of view it is topological relationships like meet, within and overlap which are most likely to be queried by a user of spatial database management system (SDBMS) . <p> For example, calculating the length of an arc has no lasting effect on the arc itself. Dynamic operations alter the objects upon which the operations act. The three fundamental dynamic operations are create, destroy, and update. All dynamic operations are variations upon one of these themes <ref> [Worboys, 1995] </ref>. In the table 2.3.
