Abstract: Sophisticated disk scheduling algorithms require accurate, detailed disk drive specifications, including data about mechanical delays, on-board caching and prefetch-ing algorithms, command and protocol overheads, and logical-to-physical block mappings. Comprehensive disk models used in storage subsystem design require similar levels of detail. We describe a suite of general-purpose algorithms and techniques for acquiring the necessary information from a SCSI disk drive. Using only the ANSI-standard interface, we demonstrate how the important parameter values of a modern SCSI drive can be determined accurately and efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Some systems (such as HP-UX <ref> [Clegg86] </ref>) have built-in monitoring and trace-points that provide the necessary timing capability. In general, our extraction techniques require access to the O/S source code, a device driver development environment, or an unprotected I/O card (e.g., on a machine running MS/DOS).

Reference-contexts: We developed and tested our extraction techniques using three disk drives from different manufacturers: a DEC RZ26, a Seagate ST41601N [Seag92, Seag92a], and an HP C2490A <ref> [HP93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Given the growing disparity between processor and disk speeds, achieving high system performance requires that disk drives be used intelligently. Previous work has demonstrated that disk request scheduling algorithms can significantly reduce seek and rotational latency delays <ref> [Jaco91, Selt90] </ref>, and scheduling algorithms that exploit the on-board disk cache can further boost performance [Wort94]. Such algorithms require detailed knowledge of disk characteristics, including mechanical delays, on-board caching and prefetching algorithms, command and protocol overheads, and logical-to-physical data block mappings.

Reference-contexts: Such algorithms require detailed knowledge of disk characteristics, including mechanical delays, on-board caching and prefetching algorithms, command and protocol overheads, and logical-to-physical data block mappings. Comprehensive disk models utilized in storage subsystem research require similar levels of detail <ref> [Ruem94] </ref>. Information about disk drives can be obtained by reading technical reference manuals, directly monitoring disk activity at the hardware level, and/or talking directly to the drive firmware developers and mechanical engineers. <p> Our detailed disk simulator closely matches real disk behavior when configured with the extracted parameters. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a brief description of modern SCSI disk drives. For a more detailed discussion, the reader is referred to <ref> [Ruem94] </ref>. Section 3 identifies the system facilities needed for parameter extraction and describes our experimental setup. Sections 4 and 5 describe interrogative and empirical extraction techniques, respectively. Section 6 validates the extraction techniques. Section 7 discusses how disk request schedulers can utilize extracted data. <p> We configured a detailed disk simulator with the extracted values to allow comparison between measured and modeled disk behavior. For all three disks, the mean service times differ by less than 1%. Greater insight can be achieved by comparing the service time distributions <ref> [Ruem94] </ref>. Figures 3-5 show distributions of measured and simulated service times for equivalent validation workloads. Ruemmler and Wilkes define the root mean square horizontal distance between the two distribution curves as a demerit figure for disk model calibration.

Slipped defects, on the other hand, can cause major data layout perturbations (especially in the case of track-based slipping). <p> If the scheduler has extracted cache parameters, it should give precedence to requests that will hit in the cache <ref> [Wort94] </ref>. 8 Conclusions and future work Aggressive disk scheduling and accurate performance modeling both require thorough, quantified understanding of disk drive behavior. We have described a set of general techniques for efficiently gathering the necessary information from modern SCSI disk drives.
