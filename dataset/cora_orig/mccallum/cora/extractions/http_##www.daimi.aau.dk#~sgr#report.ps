Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This project is a continuation of a project made in the course Knowledge Based Systems at Aarhus University <ref> [1] </ref>. The aim of that project was to evolve a neural network to control a simulated robot. The task of the robot was to juggle one or more balls. The neural network was trained by a genetic algorithm. That project turned out to be too ambitious.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore we have focused on the operators used in the generic algorithm to train the network. This report describes our experiment with different crossover operators on a network where radial basis functions (RBF) were used to generate the output. 2 Related Work In <ref> [2] </ref>, dioeerent crossover operators are tried. The experiments were done on an ordinary multilayer neural network. The role of the dioeerent units was found by putting input on the net and then look at the activity of the units.

Reference-contexts: However, their results show no signiocant improvement in performance when using a crossover operator which takes into account the role of the units instead of ordinary crossover operators. Other researchers have tried grouping weights to and/or from units, and then interchanging the whole group during crossover. See <ref> [3] </ref> for references on this work. When using radial basis functions as functions in a network it is possible to ond out which hidden units respond to which part of the input space. This gives the opportunity to construct dioeerent crossover operators which takes this information into account.

In <ref> [4] </ref> a genetic algorithm is used to generate a space olling curve, on which the centre of the RBF's are placed. [5] uses genetic algorithm to place the RBF's in the input space and determine the widths of the functions. The magnitude of the functions are determined by learning.

This is somewhat surprising because in <ref> [5] </ref> area node crossover had better performance than 1- and 2-point node crossover. However our area crossover operator is not identical to the one in [5], it may be that our operator cuts out a too little volume in the input space causing the evolution to be slow. 5 Conclusion and <p> This is somewhat surprising because in <ref> [5] </ref> area node crossover had better performance than 1- and 2-point node crossover.
