Abstract: The problem of acoustical echo in a headset-free full duplex communication environment is explained and the potential solutions are sketched. The different methods for acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) via adaptive filters are outlined and their suitability for a 16-bit fixed point implementation on a digital signal processor (DSP) is evaluated. The current prototype for the ICSI Acoustic Echo Canceller (IAEC) which uses an allpass-based subband adaptive approach is introduced and directions for future work are given.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The occurrence of echoes is a well known problem for long distance communication links and has been experienced in the telephone network due to the imperfections of the telephone hybrid <ref> [1] </ref>. The telephone hybrid is unable to completely prevent the incoming speech signal from traveling back to the originator, resulting in echo which the talker hears. An even more challenging problem occurs in hands free telephones and multimedia communication equipment [2], [3] where echoes due to room reverberations occur. <p> Equation (11) is also known as Newton's method <ref> [1] </ref>. If the signals involved in the echo cancelling 9 process were stationary, one would need to estimate L,k and 5 / N* - only once to adapt the filter to the room acoustics. <p> Especially for speech signals the frequency spectrum is highly colored. Yet for the derivation of the LMS algorithm we will continue using the simplification R L,k = I. 5.1 The LMS algorithm The least mean square (LMS) algorithm by Widrow et alii <ref> [1] </ref> is a robust and simple method to adapt the weights of an ALC. The weight update equation is (15). The crucial idea, however, is the way in which the gradient L,k is estimated.

An illustration of this problem can be seen in fig. 1. <p> It has been shown that the transfer function of a room changes considerably even if a single chair is changed in the room. A person who is moving around in the room causes even greater changes in the transfer function <ref> [3] </ref>. Hence H (z) must be able to track the ever changing room acoustics even under adverse conditions like noise or near end talk.

Reference-contexts: Yet speech recognition has done research on this topics decades ago and has found methods how to detect the boundaries of speech signals <ref> [4] </ref>. These detection methods impose some delay on the audio system which, however, can be kept within reasonable bounds for real time applications. <p> The echo suppression method can be seen as a "poor man's version" of getting rid of the long distance echo and is of importance for low end workstations. The power estimating filter in fig. 3 generally covers a time window of roughly 75ms <ref> [4] </ref> which corresponds to 500 taps in case of 8kHz sampling freuency. 4. <p> The basic idea in fig. 5 is to take the signal of the loudspeaker and subtract it from the microphone signal so that only those components are remaining which stem from signal other than the loudspeaker's <ref> [4] </ref>. This way the far end talker doesn't hear his own echo. The loudspeaker signal has to be filtered by an adaptive filter H (z) which models the room acoustics.

Reference-contexts: If the on/off switching of the microphone is replaced by a more smooth method of adjusting the gain of the microphone, the quality of echo suppressor can be improved <ref> [5] </ref>. The echo suppression method can be seen as a "poor man's version" of getting rid of the long distance echo and is of importance for low end workstations.

Reference-contexts: The above solution has the drawback that, depending, on the room, the adaptive filter H (z) might be a filter of high degree if an FIR approach is used. This often doesn't allow the filter to be implemented in SW on a general purpose processor alone <ref> [6] </ref>. An additional signal processor board is usually necessary. Or subsequent discussion will concentrate on the solution shown in fig. 5. 5 4.3 Further economic considerations Since the cancellation of the partner's echo is technically the only viable approach, it is mandatory that all participating conference partners use an AEC.

Reference-contexts: Therefore residual echo is usually suppressed rather than cancelled <ref> [7] </ref>. The prerequisite is that the AEC meets a certain quality standard. If this is the case, the microphone gain can be lowered if the echo-cancelled microphone signal falls below a certain threshold.

Reference-contexts: The normalized LMS algorithm (NLMS) is more robust than its unnormalized counterpart and shows an improved convergence behaviour <ref> [8] </ref>. 5.2 Improved versions of NLMS As has been elaborated above, the NLMS algorithm is based on the assumption R L,k =I, which is not justified for AEC applications. <p> Additionally L is constrained to be a power of two. A computationally more efficient way to evaluate the sliding DFT as well as DCT can be obtained by using the Goertzel algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. Several authors have investigated this possibility [25], [26], [27], and the basic block diagram is sketched in fig. 16 for the DCT. <p> In acoustic echo cancelers L can easily turn out to be in the range of 1000-3000 resulting in a significant computational burden. However, it has been shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that the RLS algorithm is superior to the NLMS algorithm in terms of convergence speed and tracking if the eigenvalue spread of the input correlation matrix is large. This large eigenvalue spread is characteristic in AEC scenarios.

Reference-contexts: As the data involved in the adaptation process are noisy anyway the impreciseness of the gradient estimation doesn't affect the quality of the adaptation. As an aside it shall also be mentioned that the gradient estimation (25) can, of course, also be utilized in (12). Further analysis <ref> [9] </ref> reveals that, on average, the closer m is to the midpoint of its region of convergence, the faster the convergence. Conversely, the closer it is to zero from that point, the slower the convergence. <p> FAP is the fast evaluation of the Affine Projection Algorithm (APA) <ref> [9] </ref>, [37], [41], which can be formulated according to [36] W W X fi fi fi 1 35 where e d k LxN k LxN k k fi - fi , , (100) k k LxN k L k = - with X X X X LxN k L k L <p> Most notably there is a delay z -D which delays the microphone signal and enables the adaptive filters to have "leading taps", i.e. a slightly noncausal impulse response. This interesting phenomenon that noncausality appears in subband AECs is further explained in <ref> [9] </ref> and [48]. Most subband implementations to date make use of fractional sampling in order to prevent aliasing as aliasing is a major cause for residual echo. In addition the stopband attenuation requirements can be fulfilled more easily. The idea of fractional sampling is indicated in fig. 25.

Reference-contexts: Yet the NLMS algorithm enjoys wide popularity due to its simplicity and robustness, although its convergence speed is unsatisfactory for large values of L. There are some workarounds, however, which attempt to relieve the problems accompanied with NLMS. 5.2.1 Row array projections Row array projections (RAP) <ref> [10] </ref> are a generalization of the NLMS algorithm in that the weight updates are made more often than just once per new sample. <p> fi fi fi fi = + t 1 (34) where k denotes the iteration and n k k may refer to older vectors X L n k , and older desired values d n k can be shown that doing more updates during one sample period improves the convergence rate <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: which can be utilized for the purpose of doing several weight updates per sample period. 5.2.2 Variable Step Size A further method to improve the NLMS algorithm is to adjust the stepsize m depending on either the adaptation progress or the index of the weight vector element to be changed <ref> [11] </ref>. The motivation behind the first idea is to use small stepsizes for small weights and larger stepsizes for larger weights [12].

Reference-contexts: The motivation behind the first idea is to use small stepsizes for small weights and larger stepsizes for larger weights <ref> [12] </ref>. The second idea attempts to use large stepsizes at the beginning of the adaptation, when the error is large, and to switch to smaller stepsizes later on when the task is to precisely locate the minimum of x . <p> The first approach, the socalled exponentially weighted stepsize algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> assumes that a room has approximately an exponentially decaying impulse response.

Reference-contexts: Hence (38) is not room independent. Additionally the derivation assumes d k,nt 0 which is why this algorithm is sensitive to noise.

Reference-contexts: It has to be mentioned, however, that the estimation of E d k nt , 2 as well E D D L k L k , , ! $ # is difficult.

Instead of working on the original time sequences, the adaptive filter uses the differential information only which is obtained via the highpass filters hp (z)=(1-z -1 ).

Reference-contexts: Another disadvantage of decorrelation approaches in general is that the decorrelated signals are usually low in magnitude which causes accuracy problems in fixed point implementations. 5.2.3.2 Time Variant Decorrelation Filters This approach uses "prewhitened" signals x' k and d' k which are obtained by higher order time variant decorrelation filters <ref> [16] </ref>, [17]. As these signals are distorted versions of the loudspeaker signal x k and the microphone signal d k , the basic version of this approach requires two identical adaptive filters as can be seen in fig. 10. <p> Again, small numbers are prevalent in the DCR-calculations which call for high precision computation, especially when large values of L are used. 5.2.4 Perfect Sequences Perfect Sequences <ref> [16] </ref>, [19] constitute an optimal excitation signal for the NLMS algorithm such that an L-tap adaptive filter is completely adapted after 2L input signal samples.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea when working with decorrelation filters F (z) is to predict the future signal vector X L k , from the most recent signal vector X L k , - 1 by the Levinson-Durbin <ref> [18] </ref> algorithm and to subtract the predicted vector X L k , from the actual vector X L k , . As only correlated components can be predicted, ideally only the uncorrelated components remain after subtraction and yield a much better input signal for the NLMS algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Simulations where low powered training signals were used to help improve the convergence behaviour of an NLMS-AEC have been conducted and have shown indeed some improvement. Subjective tests via DSP implementations in real audio systems, however, indicated that no perceivable improvement can be obtained <ref> [21] </ref>. 5.2.5 Transform Domain LMS (TDLMS) All of the above approaches to improve the behaviour of the LMS algorithm are operating in the time domain. An intriguing idea, however, is to use the frequency domain in order to decorrelate the input signal of the LMS algorithm [22], [23].

Reference-contexts: An intriguing idea, however, is to use the frequency domain in order to decorrelate the input signal of the LMS algorithm <ref> [22] </ref>, [23]. An intuitive approach is to apply a Fourier series decomposition to the input signal x k which yields the coefficients for each of the frequency components. As the Fourier basis functions form an orthogonal set the different frequencies should be totally uncorrelated. <p> Hence the Fourier analysis is approximated by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for which fast algorithms exist. The block diagram for this approach is depicted in fig. 15. Not only the DFT but any other orthogonal transform can be used to decorrelate the input signal <ref> [22] </ref>, [23]. In real-time (or nonblock) algorithms, the flow of input samples is continuously transformed by a fixed, data-independent transform which, in case of speech signals, is often chosen to be the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This way of continuously transforming is also called "sliding transform".

Reference-contexts: Most notably there is a delay z -D which delays the microphone signal and enables the adaptive filters to have "leading taps", i.e. a slightly noncausal impulse response. This interesting phenomenon that noncausality appears in subband AECs is further explained in [9] and <ref> [48] </ref>. Most subband implementations to date make use of fractional sampling in order to prevent aliasing as aliasing is a major cause for residual echo. In addition the stopband attenuation requirements can be fulfilled more easily. The idea of fractional sampling is indicated in fig. 25.

The Unix-workstations were located in different rooms and ran a full-duplex communicationSW like the one described in <ref> [62] </ref>. The experimental setup and subjective assessment was chosen over a simulation-based study for several reasons. Firstly, there are simulation studies galore in the scientific literature which, however, almost never take finite precision arithmetic into account.
