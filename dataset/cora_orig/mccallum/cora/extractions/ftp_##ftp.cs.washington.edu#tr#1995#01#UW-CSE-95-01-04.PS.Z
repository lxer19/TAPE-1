Abstract: Preliminary Results) Abstract Rapid commercialization of the Internet and development of the National Information Infrastructure are likely to change the nature of retailing and commerce in profound ways. These changes pose both challenges and oppor-tunites for AI, such as how to design intelligent assistants that help humans cope with the increasing complexities of electronic commerce. In this paper, we present the first steps towards creating automated bargaining agents | intelligent assistants that can reason about the relative supply and demand for goods and services and negotiate to reach a good deal. We first review the economic and game theoretic background for such an endeavor. We then present a simple economic model of electronic commerce and describe several bargaining strategies. Preliminary experimental results suggest that sophisticated, adaptive strategies perform better than simple discounting approaches over a range of economic conditions. fl Many thanks to Jim Dana and Kathy Spier for discussions about game theory and economics. We would also like to thank Adam Carlson, Denise Draper, Oren Etzioni, Terrance Goan, Keith Golden, Nicholas Kushmerick, Neal Lesh, W. Derrick Weathersby, Mike Williamson, and Erh-Chun Yeh for suggesting bargaining strategies and providing helpful comments.

Davis and Smith's contract net protocol [4] provides an auction mechanism for agent negotiation using coordinated dialogue interactions comprising announcement, bidding, and award of contracts. Sandholm refined the bidding and awarding process using marginal cost calculations [15].

Reference-contexts: If either the buyer or seller is soft, it will eventually reveal itself and the game will turn into a complete information one and terminate. Chatterjee and Samuelson <ref> [2] </ref> show that this strategy forms an equilibrium for the game, but they are forced to conclude that a multitude of other equilibria exist. In the presence of multiple equilibria, it is rather difficult to analytically prefer one strategy to another. <p> that while computer simulation has been used to evaluate agent strategies in simple games like the prisoner's dilemma [6] and double auctions [7], it has not been applied to the general case of unrestricted, multi-period bargaining. 3 Economic Model of Electronic Commerce We elaborate the economic model of Chatterjee Samuelson <ref> [2] </ref>, to account for multiple buyers and multiple sellers. There is a single commodity ("widgets"), but each agent's valuation for a widget is an arbitrary real number (i.e., no limitation of two values as in the Chatterjee and Samuelson model).

Reference-contexts: Shoham [16] advocates a computational framework called agent-oriented programming (AOP), where agents are defined in terms of beliefs, capabilities, decisions, and obligations. Agents communicate with each other via message passing, where message types (request, inform, promise, etc.) are drawn from the speech act theory <ref> [3] </ref>. Sidner extended AOP and proposed an artificial negotiation language that models human negotiations of collaboration [18]. Although we implemented our bargaining strategies in plain Common Lisp, we could have easily expressed them in the AOP framework instead.

Reference-contexts: There are many existing approaches that we might adopt to make our bar gaining agents more intelligent and sophisticated. For example, Kraus et al. built an agent that played the game of Diplomacy <ref> [8] </ref>, which involved negotiation of sophisticated military agreements. It may be possible to adapt her structure and some of her negotiation heuristics into an automated bargaining agent.

Reference-contexts: We might also adopt Gmytrasiewicz et al.'s recursive modeling method so our agent could use its predictions of other agents' responses when planning its actions [5,5]. In addition, Kraus et al. presented a strategic model of negotiation that takes time into account during the negotiation process <ref> [9] </ref>. Such mechanism could be applicable to our experiments as they get more dynamic and time-sensitive. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we advocated a new challenging domain for AI applications, and made the first steps towards building an intelligent bargaining assistant for electronic commerce.

Reference-contexts: As a result, a common tactic is for buyer B to make an offer which is substantially less than value (B) in an attempt to conceal her true valuation. One can analyze bargaining in terms of game theory <ref> [10] </ref>. Players are individuals, such as B and S above, who are capable of making decisions. An action by a player is a choice she can make; examples include making an offer or accepting the offer of another player.

Reference-contexts: Although we implemented our bargaining strategies in plain Common Lisp, we could have easily expressed them in the AOP framework instead. Rosenschein and Zlotkin have applied economic and game theory to formal analysis of protocols for automated negotiation among agents <ref> [11] </ref>. They proposed evaluation schemes for protocols in terms of efficiency, stability, and simplicity. For example, the Vickrey auction mechanism (best bid wins, gets second price) is attractive since it provides no incentive for an agent to underbid or overbid [12].

Rosenschein and Zlotkin also identified the connection 12 between protocols and domains, and categorized domains into a hierarchy of task-oriented domains, state-oriented domains, and worth-oriented domains. In addition, they address the case of incomplete information and consider the design of deception-free protocols.

Reference-contexts: For example, although AT&T, MCI, and Sprint have 87% of the $61 billion long distance market, nearly 400 companies provided long distance service in the United States in 1994 <ref> [13] </ref>. Furthermore, each of these companies offers multiple contracts. For example, AT&T True USA Savings provides a 10% discount for bills between $10-24:99 per month, 20% discount for bills between $25-74:99, and a 30% discount for bills over $75; there is no monthly fee.

Reference-contexts: If no offer is ever accepted, both payoffs are zero. This game is noncooperative, with perfect, symmetric, complete, and certain information. Rubinstein <ref> [14] </ref> showed that this discounted, infinite game has a unique, perfect equilibrium outcome in which A receives r 2 +r r 2 +2r . Thus if r = :1 then A could demand 52% of the pie and a rational B could gain nothing by arguing and so would accept.
