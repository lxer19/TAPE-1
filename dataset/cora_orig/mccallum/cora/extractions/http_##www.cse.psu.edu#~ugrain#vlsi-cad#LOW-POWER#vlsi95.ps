Reference-contexts: Usually, the critical input is placed on the signal with least delay path to the output for delay reduction [4], however for slow input transition times the opposite, i.e., placing the critical input closest to the power rail, is reported to exhibit the best speed <ref> [1] </ref>. We have considered the power consumption of the gate with different input orderings.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on power optimization has concentrated mainly on reducing the power consumption due to switching, e.g., by architectural transforms <ref> [2] </ref>, reducing supply voltage [7], reducing interconnect capacitance [10], minimizing circuit activity. The short circuit power consumption, also plays a significant part in the total power con sumed by the circuit. Let us first look at the transition characteristics of a static CMOS circuit. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we suggest that 2 all the transistors in a circuit should be sized appropri-ately for minimizing power, while the transistors along the critical path may be sized further for speed. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: A POWER-PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZER FOR CMOS LAYOUTS Transistor sizing and input reordering heuristics discussed above have been incorporated into our power-performance constrained module generator, PowerSizer. We use the timing model used in Perflex <ref> [5] </ref>, i.e., a distributed RC tree network based Elmore delay model. The delay computed using this model is shown to be quite consistent with the real delay of the circuit [5]. We have developed a table lookup transistor sizing function based on extensive hspice simulation results. <p> We use the timing model used in Perflex <ref> [5] </ref>, i.e., a distributed RC tree network based Elmore delay model.
