Abstract: We present a neural system for the recognition of objects from realistic images, together with results of tests of face recognition from a large gallery. The system is inherently invariant with respect to shift, and is robust against many other variations, most notably rotation in depth and deformation. The system is based on Dynamic Link Matching. It consists of an image domain and a model domain, which we tentatively identify with primary visual cortex and infero-temporal cortex. Both domains have the form of neural sheets of hypercolumns, which are composed of simple feature detectors (modeled as Gabor-based wavelets). Each object is represented in memory by a separate model sheet, that is, a two-dimensional array of features. The match of the image to the models is performed by network self-organization, in which rapid reversible synaptic plasticity of the connections ("dynamic links") between the two domains is controlled by signal correlations, which are shaped by fixed inter-columnar connections and by the dynamic links themselves. The system requires very little genetic or learned structure, relying essentially on the rules of rapid synaptic plasticity and the a priori constraint of preservation of topography to find matches. This constraint is encoded within the neural sheets with the help of lateral connections, which are excitatory over short range and inhibitory over long range.

Reference-contexts: two layers, link dynamics, attention dynamics, and recognition dynamics; in order to make the description clearer, parts of the equations in Table 1 corresponding to these functions will be repeated. 2.2 Blob Formation Blob formation on a layer of neurons can easily be achieved by local cooperation and global inhibition <ref> (Amari, 1977) </ref>. Local cooperation generates clusters of activity, and global inhibition lets the clusters compete against each other. The strongest one will finally suppress all others and grow to an equilibrium size determined by the strengths of cooperation and inhibition. The corresponding equations are (cf.

Reference-contexts: This distinguishes it from many alternative neural models for object recognition, which require extensive control structures <ref> (Anderson and Van Essen, 1987) </ref> or specific feature hierarchies, to be created by training (Fukushima et al., 1983; LeCun et al., 1989), before the first object can be recognized. <p> of our present system, and neurons in different areae but subserving the same retinal point could just be lumped together into one "hyper-hypercolumn." ii) The synaptic projection systems between areae are substantially reorganized during the recognition process, areae perhaps forming sequential layers connecting V1 indirectly with IT, as proposed in <ref> (Anderson and Van Essen, 1987) </ref>. Perhaps such an indirect connectivity scheme can reduce the enormous number of fibers required by our system for connecting any pair of points in image and models.

Reference-contexts: The time scale of the recognition dynamics can be controlled by r . 2.8 Bidirectional Connections The connectivity between two layers is bidirectional and not unidirectional as in the previous system <ref> (Konen and Vorbr uggen, 1993) </ref>. This is necessary for two reasons: Firstly, by this means the running blobs of the two connected layers can more easily align. With unidirectional connections one blob would systematically run behind the other. Secondly, connections in both directions are necessary for a recognition system.

Reference-contexts: In many other cases the correct face can be recognized without modifying the connectivity matrix. Recognition rates for galleries of 20, 50, and 111 models are given in Table 3. As is already known from previous work <ref> (Lades et al., 1993) </ref>, recognition of depth-rotated faces is in general less reliable than, for instance, recognition of faces with an altered expression (the examples in Figure 8 are not typical in this respect). It is interesting to consider recognition times.

Reference-contexts: There is one apparent mismatch between our system and the reality of object recognition in the brain of adults: the time taken by the process. There are reports that objects of different type can be distinguished by human subjects in less than a tenth of a second <ref> (Subramaniam et al., 1995) </ref>. In contrast, our system requires for the process many hundred sequential steps. It is not easy to interpret these sequential steps in terms of biological real time.

Reference-contexts: Two extreme versions are imaginable, i) models are laid down in mutual register in terms of internal position, and ii) there is a fixed spatial array of feature types in infero-temporal cortex (for which there is faint experimental evidence <ref> (Tanaka, 1993) </ref>), and laying down a model consists in selecting appropriate feature cells and connecting these as required by the inner structure of the model.
