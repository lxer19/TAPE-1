Reference-contexts: If r is obvious from the context, we just write f (). We use the abbreviation f (A) for f (A = 1), and f (ABC) for f (A = 1 ^ B = 1 ^ C = 1). An association rule <ref> [2] </ref> on the relation r is an expression X ) B, where X R and B 2 R. <p> In data mining contexts, one might use be tempted to use the confidences of the association rules <ref> [2] </ref> A ) B and B ) A. For example, one could use the distance function I c (A; B) = (1 c (A ) B)) + (1 c (B ) A)): We have the following. <p> reasonably small probe sets P we can keep all these in memory, and one pass through the database suffices to compute all the necessary counts. 10 In fact, computing these counts is a special case of the problem of computing all the frequent sets that arises in association rule discovery <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. If we are not interested in probe sets of small frequency, we can use variations of the Apriori [4] algorithm for the computations needed.

This method is fast and scales nicely to very large data sets. 4.5 Introducing new attributes One of the reasons for considering attribute similarity was the ability to build attribute hierarchies, i.e., to do hierarchical clustering on attributes.

Reference-contexts: In- stead of considering the full distributions, we look at the marginal distributions on single variables. There are some connections to the notions of Kullbach- Leibler distance (also known as relative entropy or cross entropy) and the Heller- stein distance between distributions <ref> [15, 5] </ref>. 4.2 Variations The definition of E P is by no means the only possible one.

Reference-contexts: Such randomization methodology is currently fairly widely used in statistics (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a very readable introduction). Here we choose the functions f i to measure the frequency of a certain probe variable.

Reference-contexts: We can measure the strength of association between A and B in numerous ways; see <ref> [9] </ref> for a compendium of methods. Possibilities include the 2 test statistic, measuring the deviation of the observed values n ij from the expected values under the assumption of independence. Note that this measure is not oblivious to double zeroes, for obvious reasons. <p> If the value F P (A; B) is large, then A and B are not behaving in the same way with respect to the attributes in P . One might be tempted to use F P or some similar notion as an measure of similarity. However, as <ref> [9] </ref> puts it, "The fact that an excellent test of independence may be based on 2 does not at all meant that 2 , or some simple function 4 or we have forgotten the test statistics 8 of it, is an appropriate measure of degree of association."

[9] goes on to use different models based on predictive ability etc., and we follow this advice. Therefore we use the measure E P (A; B) = D2P for the distance between attributes A and B.

Reference-contexts: Again, the results are quite natural. 5.3 Telecommunications alarm data In telecommunication network management the handling of so called alarm sequences is quite important. In this application, data mining methods have been shown to be useful <ref> [10] </ref>. Here we describe how our external distance measures 15 criterion. can be used to detect similarities between alarms. We analyzed a sequence of 58616 alarms with associated occurrence times from a telephone exchange, collected during a time period of 12 days.

Reference-contexts: Again, we see great variation, as is to be expected. Clustering using the external distances To further illustrate the behavior of the external and internal distance functions, we clustered the 14 countries using a standard agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. As distance between clusters, we used the minimum distance between the elements of the clusters. Figure 4 shows the result.

Reference-contexts: Section 3 studies internal measures of similarity, and shows that they fail to satisfy these requirements. In Section 4 2 we present the definition of external measures, describe some of their properties, and discuss their computation. Section 5 gives experimental results on three real-life datasets: the Reuters-21578 collection <ref> [16] </ref> of newswire articles, a course enrollment data set, and a telecommunications alarm sequence. <p> Thus we can continue the clustering without having to look at the original data again. 5 Experimental results We have used three data sets in our experiments: the so-called Reuters-21578 collection <ref> [16] </ref> of newswire articles, a database about students and courses at the Computer Science Department of the University of Helsinki, and telecommunication alarm sequence data. 5.1 Documents and keywords The data set consists of 21578 articles from the Reuters newswire in 1987. Each article has been tagged with keywords.

Reference-contexts: There are about 10 6 windows, i.e., rows, as the time period was about 10 6 seconds. (These rows do not have to be constructed explicitly, and one can also use the fact that subsequent windows overlap to get quite efficient algorithms for finding frequent sets in this application <ref> [17] </ref>.) The alarms are identified by their code numbers, which are assigned by the software developers. The code numbers for the alarms have been assigned so that alarms having the same prefix typically have something to do with each other, at least in the mind of the designer.

Reference-contexts: A simple test for this is to use the 2 test statistic for two proportions, as is widely done in, e.g., epidemiology <ref> [18] </ref>. Given a probe variable D, the value of the test statistic is after some simplifications F (A; B; D) = f (r; D)(1 f (r; D))(f (r; A) + f (r; B)) where n is again the number of rows in the whole dataset.

Reference-contexts: Such similarity notions between attributes or attribute values can be used to form hierarchies or clusters of the attributes or their values. A hierarchy can itself give useful insight into the structure of the data, and hierarchies can also be used to produce more abstract rules etc. <ref> [20] </ref>. Typically, one assumes that the hierarchy is given by a domain expert. This is indeed a good solution, but in several cases the data can be such that no domain expert is available, and hence there is no ready source for the hierarchy.
