Title: Catalyzing Database Inference with Fuzzy Relations

Abstract: Inference analysis plays a major role in database security and knowledge discovery. Common sense knowledge, typically expressed in imprecise or fuzzy terms, can be introduced as catalytic relations to existing databases. Analyzing the augmented databases materializes new rules and latent compromising inference channels based on common knowledge and existing database data. This paper shows how fuzzy relations can be used to catalyze new inferences in database systems. A knowledge discovery tool for analyzing catalytic inference in Oracle databases is described.

Reference-contexts: However, it is now possible to have redundant tuples which are different from each other. Entity integrity can be maintained in an imprecise, fuzzy or precise relation by "merging" each block of redundant tuples into a single tuple <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Classical inference analysis uses Armstrong's Axioms to compute an inference closure based on FDs. Counterparts to Armstrong's axioms exist for context based FDs. Proposition 3.2: Context-based FDs satisfy Arm-strong's Axioms (reflexivity, augmentation, transitiv ity). In addition to Armstrong's axioms, certain inference axioms specific to context-based FDs exist <ref> [5] </ref>. The following axiom states that if an information chunk x determines some chunk y using an FD, then information more precise than x can determine infor mation less precise than y.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 3.5: FD: XY (C X C Y ) ! Z (C Z ) implies FD: X (C X ) ! Z (I XY !Z (C X ? Y )). Inference channels convey information flow due to FDs. Precise inference channels are composed of a "use set" of FDs <ref> [6] </ref>. Correspondingly, inference channels in a mixed database are composed of a use set of context-based FDs. To simplify the task of inference channel detection, nonlinear inference channels are modeled as combinations of linear channels.

Reference-contexts: The design is influenced by the DISSECT system developed at SRI International <ref> [9] </ref>. The current version of DISSECT graphically interacts with users in detecting precise inference channels due to foreign key FDs in MLS databases. This graphical interaction paradigm is exploited by the tool in identifying precise and imprecise inference paths.

Reference-contexts: Analyzing the augmented databases materializes latent imprecise rules and potentially compromising imprecise inference channels. Despite its importance, few practical techniques exist for analyzing imprecise inference in database systems [4,5,8]. This paper uses a special formalism <ref> [11] </ref> for modeling and identifying generalized FD-based inference channels in relational databases. The inference discovery methodology supports the analysis of precise, imprecise and catalytic inference.

Reference-contexts: The model uses the notion of a "context," a partition on a database domain constructed from an equivalence relation (e.g., similarity relation <ref> [13] </ref>), to define certain generalized database integrity properties. To simplify the task of maintaining compatibility, tuple membership is assumed to be a Boolean property.
