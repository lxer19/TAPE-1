Abstract: Why do children learn nouns such as cup faster than dimensional adjectives such as big? Most explanations of this phenomenon rely on prior knowledge of the noun-adjective distinction or on the logical priority of nouns as the arguments of predicates. In this paper we examine an alternative account, one which relies instead on properties of the semantic categories to be learned and of the word learning task itself. We isolate four such properties: the relative size, the relative compactness, and the degree of overlap of the regions in representational space associated with the categories and the presence or absence of lexical dimensions (what color? ) in the linguistic context of a word. In a set of five experiments, we trained a simple connectionist network to label input objects in particular linguistic contexts. The network learned categories resembling nouns with respect to the four properties faster than it learned categories resembling adjectives. Young children learn nouns more rapidly and less errorfully than they learn adjectives. The nouns that children so readily learn typically label concrete things such as BLOCK 1 and DOG. The adjectives that young children learn with greater difficulty label the perceptible properties of these same objects, for example, RED and WET. Why are concrete nouns easier for young children to learn than dimensional adjectives? fl To whom correspondence should be addressed 1 We will use uppercase for concepts, italics for linguistic forms, and double quotes for utterances.

Reference-contexts: It means that input dimensions that are distinct at input are not (at least not without learning) represented separately. This aspect of the architecture is based on considerable research indicating that young children have difficulty attending selectively to individual dimensions <ref> (Aslin & Smith, 1988) </ref> and on our past use of this architecture to model developmental changes in selective attention to dimensions (Gasser & Smith, 1991; Smith, 1993). We will discuss more fully the wider implications of this aspect of the network in the General Discussion.

Reference-contexts: This literature is replete with examples of both within- and between-dimension errors, interpreting big to mean TALL (Maratsos, 1988), big to mean BRIGHT (Carey, 1978, 1982), dark to mean LOUD (Smith & Sera, 1992), and blue to mean GREEN <ref> (Backscheider & Shatz, 1993) </ref>. Although plentiful, these errors are constrained. They consist of confusions within the semantic domain of dimensional terms. That is, children may confuse dark and loud but they do not confuse dark and room.

Reference-contexts: The first concerns the kinds of words that comprise early productive vocabularies. Nouns dominate; dimensional adjectives are rare or nonexistent. For example, in Stern's diary study of the acquisition of English <ref> (Gentner, 1978) </ref>, 78% of the words produced at 20 months were nouns while none were adjectives. Similarly, in Nelson's (1973) study of 18 children learning English, fewer than 7% of the first 50 words were adjectives.

Reference-contexts: This form of encoding completely obscures ordering along the dimension because there is no correlation between the numbers in different positions in the vector (or the activations of units in each dimension group). At the other extreme is a "thermometer" encoding <ref> (Harnad, Hanson, & Lubin, 1991) </ref>. In a thermometer representation, each of the positions in the vector corresponds to a point along a scale, and the value to be encoded normally falls between two of the positions. <p> This involves some readjustment of the regions in hidden-layer space associated with inputs. In particular, inputs belonging to the same category will tend to map onto relatively compact regions in hidden-layer space <ref> (Harnad et al., 1991) </ref>. Each time the network is trained on an instance of a category, the weights in the network are adjusted in such a way that that point in input space tends to get assigned to the region in output space associated with the category.

Reference-contexts: a wealth of purely formal information to guide them in learning, and a large body of recent work has focused on the extent to which linguistic categories can be learned on the basis of distributional information (Elman, 1990; Finch & Chater, 1992) or the formal properties of the words themselves <ref> (Kelly, 1992) </ref>. As in the present model, these approaches are statistical and associative; in fact, many are implemented in the form of connectionist networks.

Reference-contexts: Long after children begin to use dimensional words, when they are as old as 3, 4, or even 5 years, their interpretations of dimensional adjectives are still errorful. This literature is replete with examples of both within- and between-dimension errors, interpreting big to mean TALL <ref> (Maratsos, 1988) </ref>, big to mean BRIGHT (Carey, 1978, 1982), dark to mean LOUD (Smith & Sera, 1992), and blue to mean GREEN (Backscheider & Shatz, 1993). Although plentiful, these errors are constrained. They consist of confusions within the semantic domain of dimensional terms.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, dimensional adjectives label objects that are alike on only one property. This difference between nouns and adjectives has important conceptual consequences <ref> (see especially Markman, 1989) </ref>. <p> The argument for pre-linguistic notions of the distinction between objects and their properties is often couched in terms of arguments that "one cannot get something from nothing" <ref> (see, for example, Markman, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, there is a debate as to whether these errors are category errors. Instead, these overextensions (for example, calling a zebra "doggy") may reflect pragmatic strategies or retrieval errors (Gershkoff-Stowe & Smith, 1996; Huttenlocher, 1974). Consistent with this idea is the rarity of overextensions in comprehension <ref> (see, for example, Naigles & Gelman, 1995) </ref>. In contrast, the key question for researchers who study the acquisition of dimensional adjectives is why they are so difficult to learn. The central phenomena are comprehension errors.

Reference-contexts: The input is implicitly compared to all of these inputs. Thus the network is an instance of an exemplar-based model of categorization <ref> (e.g., Nosofsky, 1986) </ref>. In these models, it is the relative distance between an input and previously learned exemplars of the different categories which determines the behavior of the system.

Reference-contexts: Learning 5 about adjectives but not nouns thus requires discovering and selectively attending to one relevant direction in the multi-dimensional space. 2.1.2 Category Overlap Nouns and adjectives also differ in the relatedness of one category to another. Common nouns all classify objects at one level <ref> (Rosch, 1973a) </ref>. An object is a dog or a house or a watch or a car or a leaf. Thus the question what is it? is answerable by one basic noun.

Reference-contexts: This literature is replete with examples of both within- and between-dimension errors, interpreting big to mean TALL (Maratsos, 1988), big to mean BRIGHT (Carey, 1978, 1982), dark to mean LOUD <ref> (Smith & Sera, 1992) </ref>, and blue to mean GREEN (Backscheider & Shatz, 1993). Although plentiful, these errors are constrained. They consist of confusions within the semantic domain of dimensional terms.

Reference-contexts: However, there are other findings in the literature that might be interpreted as showing that common names are not compact but are, rather, adjective-like in their emphasis of a single dimension. These findings concern the so-called shape bias in early noun learning <ref> (see Smith, 1995 for a review) </ref>. Specifically, in novel word learning tasks, when a novel rigid object is named by a count noun, young children systematically generalize the newly learned name to novel objects by their shape ignoring such properties as color and texture. <p> Rather, children attend to shape when objects are rigid but attend to texture and color when they are nonrigid, and even with rigid objects, children attend to shape and texture when the objects have eyes <ref> (see Smith, 1995 for a review) </ref>. Thus, the total pattern suggests that while young children often emphasize shape in their early word generalizations, it is not to the complete exclusion of other properties. Rather, children attend to other properties and shift attention weights as a function of those properties.

Reference-contexts: Considerable evidence indicates that by 18 months (and quite possibly before), children interpret novel nouns as referring to taxonomic categories (Markman, 1989; Waxman, 1994). Further, the evidence suggests that children remember what they have learned over several days and weeks <ref> (Woodward, Markman, & Fitzsimmons, 1994) </ref>. There have been a number of attempts to use these methods to teach novel adjectives.
