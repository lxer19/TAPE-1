Abstract: A growing set of multi-media applications require continuous flow of high volume data, e.g. video and audio, that can wholly reside only in secondary (and possibly tertiary) storage devices. In this paper we discuss the design of a class of cyclical I/O scheduler that schedules synchronized access to continuous media in real-time from secondary storage devices that guarantees data rate. This model is used to explore different trade-offs and configuration issues. In addition to simultaneously accessing data, users will execute VCR operations like Play and FastForward. We describe techniques to implement such operations and the design equation that governs it. In summary, a set of five design equations are presented that provide the designer of an I/O scheduler to quantitatively decide admission control of new users, primary memory configuration, schedule computation, balancing real-time and non real-time workload, and support VCR operations.

Reference-contexts: If b is the block size of the storage system, v i 's are the per-block access times, and r i 's, the consumption rates, do not change then at all times in a I/O scheduler Design Equation 1 b &gt; i=1 The proof for this expression is provided elsewhere <ref> [KHS94] </ref>. However, we present an intuition behind this condition. In a time interval v i , a single block of data, b bytes, is fetched from the storage system. In the time to produce this block, v j r j bytes are consumed by stream j. <p> When the r i 's remain constant over rounds DE 2 gives a lower bound on the number of blocks to be fetched. Design Equation 2 n i n i = sff P s The proof of this equation is given in <ref> [KHS94] </ref>. Clearly, DE 2 shows the non-linear relation between the consumption rate of a stream, r i , and the number of blocks that need to be fetched in each round of a I/O scheduler, n fl i .
