Abstract: Shape recognition is a challenging task when shapes overlap, forming noisy, occluded, partial shapes. This paper uses a genetic algorithm for matching input shapes with model shapes described in terms of features such as line segments and angles (extracted using traditional algorithms). The quality of matching is gauged using a measure derived from attributed shape grammars [12, 13]. Preliminary results, using shapes with about 30 features each, are extremely encouraging.

Neural networks also provide powerful tools for solving the shape recognition problem [10, 11, 16]. Yang et al.

Reference-contexts: The GA gave robust matching results for the test shapes, providing rotation and size independence. Di Ianni [5] has also applied GAs for matching shapes but the results they obtained were not encouraging, possibly because of using raw pixel arrays rather than shape features. Bala and Wech-sler <ref> [2] </ref> use GAs to develop morphological operators that can discriminate among classes containing different shapes, not directly for shape matching. Section 2 is an overview of attributed string representation. The new algorithm is introduced in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: For shapes of objects that are occluded, or touch or overlap with other objects, a flexible shape recognition algorithm is needed to identify overlapping shapes, making use of incomplete information. The Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) <ref> [3] </ref> is one technique widely used in shape matching algorithms. Although this approach can be used for partial shape matching, the time-consuming nature of GHT makes it impossible to use it for real-time applications with large data. Turney et al. [14] suggested improvements to the GHT approach.

Given an input shape with n features and S model shapes with a total number of M features, we can cast partial shape matching as the problem of finding n matching features from M features.
