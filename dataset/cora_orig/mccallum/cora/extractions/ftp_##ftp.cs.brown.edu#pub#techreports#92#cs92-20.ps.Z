This is an undecidability proof for a very simple set of connected rules|see <ref> [GMSV87] </ref> for a definition of connectivity and for a technique of proving undecidability under this restriction. 4 2 Undecidability of Boundedness for Binary Programs In [GMSV87], boundedness was proven undecidable by reduction from the halting problem for 2-counter machines. The idea was that the database encodes a prefix of the natural numbers, and the program simulates the computation of the machine. Here we take a different approach. <p> As our first result, we show that program boundedness is undecidable for query programs having two linear recursive rules and one initialization rule. The reduction is from the halting problem for 2-counter machines (2CM), and follows the basic outline of the proof in <ref> [GMSV87] </ref>. The technical improvement is the polymorphic encoding of the entire transition function of the 2CM by a single linear recursion. Given a 2CM M , we construct a Datalog program P simulating M , such that M halts iff P is bounded. <p> Appendix: Ternary Datalog via the Halting Problem In this appendix, we give a proof of the undecidability of uniform boundedness for ternary Datalog programs along the lines of <ref> [GMSV87] </ref>. By using Turing machines instead of counter machines, the argument can be considerably simplified and the arity gets down to three.

Our proof, however, uses nonlinear rules, unlike the construction in [GMSV87]. We hope that a refinement of either of our two proofs will eventually resolve the undecidability of uniform boundedness for the binary case. The reduction we are going to present is from the halting problem for Turing machines. <p> First, the symbol and state fields can be merged, since both range over a finite domain. The resulting symbol/state combination can then be piggybacked onto the cell number using a technique described in the appendix of <ref> [GMSV87] </ref>: We assume that every "integer" in the database comes in as many "flavors" as there are symbol/state 23 combinations. By putting the right "flavor" of cell into a TAPE (origin; time; cell) fact, we can then encode its symbol and state content.

Example: To illustrate Datalog and boundedness consider the following canonical example <ref> [N89a] </ref>: buys (X; Y ) :| trendy (X ); buys (Z; Y ): buys (X; Y ) :| likes (X; Y ): This example is program bounded since buys (Z; Y ) can be changed to likes (Z; Y ) to yield an equivalent recursion-free program. (It is also uniformly bounded.) <p> The first results about boundedness were positive: PTIME graph-theoretic decision procedures for subclasses of linear programs were proposed in <ref> [I86, N89a] </ref> and this focused attention on the problem. Unfortunately, as first shown in [GMSV87], boundedness is undecidable in general; more importantly, undecidability of boundedness entails undecidability for many other questions concerning recursion. <p> Other decidable cases appear: in [S85] for uniform boundedness of "typed template dependency" rules, in [NS91] which generalizes <ref> [I86, N89a] </ref>, and in [HKMV91], which presents a decidability result for certain single-rule programs. 1.3 Our Contributions In this paper we concentrate on program arity and number of rules. We improve the state-of-the-art on undecidable boundedness problems for Datalog programs and introduce a number of new techniques.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It has been realized for some time that first-order database query languages are lacking in expressive power. This has led to the study of Datalog programs <ref> [K90, U89] </ref>, which combine positive existential first-order formulas with recursion|see [CH85]. Analyzing the depth of recursion of these database logic programs has emerged as a key problem, e.g., for parallel evaluation [CK86, K88, UV88] or for optimization [N89b, S88]. <p> Because of the use of the halting rule, I 2 P h+2 (D). 2 We remark that the embedding described in the above proof is in fact a containment mapping (see <ref> [U89] </ref>) between conjunctive queries: any (h + 2)-fold unwinding of P into a conjunctive query can be mapped into any t-fold unwinding, for t h + 2.

Decision procedures are possible in some other special cases: e.g., <ref> [V88] </ref> shows the NP-completeness of the 3 boundedness problem for arity 2 programs with one linear rule; also for chain rules and some of their generalizations we have decidability through context-free language finiteness tests [G90]. <p> the number of rules classification: (1) Is uniform boundedness decidable for linear single rule programs? Note that, linear, arity 4 is NP-hard [K88]; non-linear is also open. (2) Is program boundedness decidable for one linear rule, any initialization rules and any arity predicates? Note that, linear, arity 2 is NP-complete <ref> [V88] </ref>; some sufficient conditions for decidability appear in [HKMV91]; without linearity the problem is undecidable [A89]. Appendix: Ternary Datalog via the Halting Problem In this appendix, we give a proof of the undecidability of uniform boundedness for ternary Datalog programs along the lines of [GMSV87].
