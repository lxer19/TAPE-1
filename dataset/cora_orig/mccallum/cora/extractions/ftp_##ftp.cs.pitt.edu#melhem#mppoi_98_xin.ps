Abstract: This paper considers optimal routing and channel assignment (RCA) schemes to realize hypercube communication on optical meshlike networks. Specifically, we identify lower bounds on the number of channels required to realize hypercube communication on top of array and ring topologies and develop optimal RCA schemes that achieve the lower bounds on these two topologies. We further extend the schemes to mesh and torus topologies and obtain RCA schemes that use at most 2 more channels than the optimal for these topologies.

Reference-contexts: Proof: Straight forward from Theorem 1, Theorem 2 and Lemma 1.2 4 Hypercube connections on rings By having links between node 0 and node N 1, two paths can be established from any node to any other node on a ring. It has been shown <ref> [1] </ref> that even for a fixed rout ing, general optimal channel assignment problem is NP complete. In this section, we focus on the specific problem of optimal RCA for H r on ring topologies.

Reference-contexts: To achieve all optical communication without optical/electrical and electrical/optical conversions at intermediate nodes, the same channel on all links along the path must be used to establish the lightpath. This requirement is called the channel continuous requirement <ref> [2] </ref>. Due to the channelcontinuous requirement, traditional embedding techniques, which typically minimize the congestion for a given communication pattern, are not sufficient to minimize the number of virtual channels needed to realize the communication in an optical network. <p> Many researchers have studied the RCA problem in the context of either WDM networks or TDM networks.

Reference-contexts: Realizing hypercube communication efficiently on optical meshlike networks is important because of the following reasons. (1) There exist many parallel algorithms that use the hypercube communication pattern <ref> [7] </ref>. (2) Realizing a virtual hypercube topology, whose diameter is O (lg (N )), where N is the network size, on top of a meshlike topology with a larger diameter, reduces the average number of relays when messages are routed on the virtual hypercube rather than on the physical meshlike topology. <p> In [9], RCA for permutation communication patterns in mesh like networks is considered. In [8], optimal schemes for realizing alltoall patterns in multi-stage networks are presented. In [5], message scheduling for alltoall communication in meshlike topologies is described. A large body of related embedding techniques are surveyed in <ref> [7] </ref>. However, as discussed earlier, the objective and the techniques of RCA are different from that of embedding. To the best of our knowledge, optimal routing and channel assignment for hypercube communication in meshlike topologies has not been studied previously. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: The number of relays per message transmission is particularly important in optical networks where a relay requires optical/electronic and electronic/optical conversions. An extensive study of the maximum throughput and the message delay of routing dynamic traffic on the virtual hypercube described in this paper is performed in <ref> [12] </ref>, where it is shown that routing messages on the logical hypercube, in general, improves the communication efficiency over routing messages on the physical meshlike topologies. In this paper, we study optimal RCA schemes for hypercube communication on optical meshlike networks.
