Abstract: If A =&lt; A; !&gt; is an abstract reduction system, the reduction ! introduces a closure operator, and hence a topology, on the set P(A) of parts of A. In this way a bijective correspondence between certain topologies and abstract reduction systems with transitive reductions is established. Hence, we can view and formulate Church-Rosser (and its converse), Strong and Weak Normalization in topological terms. Also, we give topological proofs of some results on abstract reduction systems. 1 Abstract reduction systems

Reference-contexts: Example 1.1. In this paper the main examples of ARS's will be based on A =&lt; fl; ! fi &gt; with fl the set of -terms and ! fi = f ((x:d)e; d [x := e])g as defined in <ref> [Bar85] </ref>. We call ! + ff the relation in A that is the transitive closure of ! ff . <p> Hence C (f (C)); C (f (D)) C (f (a)). Using the hypothesis that A 0 is CR, we conclude that: C (f (C)) " C (f (D)) 6= ;. We want to study conditions to guarantee the confluence of the union of two reductions (see <ref> [Bar85] </ref> pg. 64). Definition 5.8. Let A be a set and ! ff ; ! fi two reducions on A.

Reference-contexts: Then fl 0 is a closed set in T ! fi . Observe that fl 0 is not open. Example 2.4. In the examples that follow we consider the concept of Pure Type System and the typing relation ` A : B as defined in <ref> [Bar92] </ref>. Let B j&lt; Terms; ! fi &gt; where Terms is the set of pseudoterms. The following sets are examples of closed sets in the topology T B . 3 1. <p> For the abstract reduction system &lt; fl; ! fi &gt; it is well-known that ! fi is confluent but not converse Church-Rosser. The theorem that follows is a topological version of the proof of confluence for the abstract reduction system &lt; fl; ! fi &gt; as appears in <ref> [Bar92] </ref>, pg. 138. Theorem 5.6. Let A =&lt; A; !&gt; and A 0 =&lt; A 0 ; ! 0 &gt; be a pair of abstract reduction systems. Call &lt; A; T &gt; and &lt; A 0 ; T 0 &gt; the corresponding topological spaces. <p> The continuity of f implies that g (Cf 1 (X)) g (f 1 (CX)). Hence we have that CM (X) = Cg (f 1 (X)) g (Cf 1 (X)) g (f 1 (CX)) = MC (X). In the notation of <ref> [Bar92] </ref>, the system A 0 =&lt; A 0 ; ! 0 &gt; is &lt; fl; ! fi &gt;, the system A =&lt; A; !&gt; is &lt; fl; ! fi &gt;, the function f j OE and g j j j. <p> The facts that g is closed, f is continuous and that g (f 1 (X)) = M (X); 8X A 0 are equivalent to Lemma 2.3.13, Lemma 2.3.14 (3) and Lemma 2.3.15 in <ref> [Bar92] </ref>. The theorem that follows is a topological version of the proof of confluence for a Pure Type System with definitions as considered in [SP93]. 11 Theorem 5.7. <p> The set M (M ) is not irreducible because M (M 1 ) and M (M 2 ) are disjoint open subsets of M (M ). See <ref> [Bar92] </ref>, pg. 75, Ex. 3.5.11.

Reference-contexts: In particular M (a) is closed. Example 6.6. In the case of -terms, i.e. &lt; fl; ! fi &gt; we have that Cc (a) = fb : a = fi bg = MC (a). In <ref> [Chu41] </ref> pg. 25, this result is stated as: "If A conv B, there is a conversion of A into B in which no expansion precedes any reduction". 18 If A is an abstract reduction system, we call N (A) A the set of closed points or in other words the set

Reference-contexts: This topology is sometimes called the Alexandroff topology associated to !. It has been considered especially in the case in which ! is a partial ordering on A, see <ref> [ISH92] </ref>. We mention a few basic properties of this topology. Property 2.2. A subset X A is closed if and only if it is invariant under ! reduction.

Reference-contexts: Later on, with an eye to characterizing the concept of normalization in a topological way, we consider elements such that G ! (a) = fag. 2 2 From reduction to topology We recall the definition and the basic properties of closure operators on a set (see <ref> [Kel55] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: 1 Abstract reduction systems We use the notations and definitions of <ref> [Klo90] </ref>. Here, for the reader's convenience, we recall the ones more frequently used. <p> So that M ff [fi (Z) is T ff [fi closed. Hence using Theorem 5.4 we conclude that ff [ fi is a confluent reduction. 2 5.2 Topological characterizations of normalization We recall the following definitions from <ref> [Klo90] </ref>. Definition 5.12. Let A =&lt; A; !&gt; be an ARS with only one relation. a) We say that d 2 A is a normal form for !, if there is no element c 2 A such that d ! c. <p> Notice that in accordance with the usual definitions one should use the word Artinian instead of Noetherian. We use Noetherian as in <ref> [Klo90] </ref> Definition 1.3. (iii) page 5. Theorem 5.21. Let A =&lt; A; !&gt; be an ARS. Then A almost strongly normalizes if and only if the following two conditions are verified: 1. The family P ! F ! of principal closed sets of A is Noetherian. 2.
