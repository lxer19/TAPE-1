Abstract: 1. This is a take-home exam. It should take you about eight hours to do, but you have seven days in which to do it. Plan your time wisely. Do not overwork. Be clever. 2. Bonus points will be awarded for answers that are particularly clever, simple, succinct, or efficient. You may do the problems in any order, but start each problem on a new page. You have plenty of time to do the exam, so there is no excusefor sloppiness. To guard against careless mistakes, do your solutions on scratch paper first. 3. This exam is open book: you may use your notes from the course, the course textbooks, and any other textbooks. No other sources whatsoever may be consulted. Specifically, you may not communicate with any person other than the instructor about any aspect of the exam until after the hand-in deadline, even if you have already handed in your exam. Moreover, you may not use notes or problem solutions from other times that this course or other related courses have been taught. If at any time you feel that you may have violated these conditions, it is imperative that you contact the instructor immediately. If there is any question about what resources may or may not be used during the exam, consult the instructor. 4. Bugs in the exam will be reported to you by email. Check your email regularly during the examination period. If you are in doubt about the interpretation of a question, state your (reasonable) assumptions clearly in your solution.
