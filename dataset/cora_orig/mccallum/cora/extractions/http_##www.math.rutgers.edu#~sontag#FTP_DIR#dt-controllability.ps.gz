Abstract: This paper presents a geometric study of controllability for discrete-time nonlinear systems. Various accessibility properties are characterized in terms of Lie algebras of vector fields. Some of the results obtained are parallel to analogous ones in continuous-time, but in many respects the theory is substantially different and many new phenomena appear.

For instance, take the system with XX = IR; U = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and equations x + = x 3 + 2x + u sin x: Since for each fixed value of u the right hand side is strictly increasing, this is an invertible system. We obtain here that X + sin x in the natural coordinates.

In the discrete time case analogous results to those in continuous time where provided in <ref> [9] </ref>, [32], [11], and [29], the latter containing also a proof of a more abstract result dealing with a general notion of action on manifolds.

Reference-contexts: This is analogous to associating a Lie algebra action to any given Lie group action. Other work along those lines was carried out in [11], [32], [17], <ref> [29] </ref>, and related papers. <p> u i +v ffi f u i1 u 1 (x) = Ad u i1 u 1 X + i = 1; : : : ; k, span an n-dimensional space and statement (a) follows. (b) The proof will be based on a reduction to continuous time systems, as done in <ref> [29] </ref> for the transitivity problem. A different proof, not involving such a reduction, is provided in a later section. <p> The theorem has a long history starting with results of Chow, Nagano, ([23]), Sussmann ([34]) and Stefan ([33]) in the continuous time case. In the discrete time case analogous results to those in continuous time where provided in [9], [32], [11], and <ref> [29] </ref>, the latter containing also a proof of a more abstract result dealing with a general notion of action on manifolds. These papers should be consulted for details of the proof, which we omit. <p> In fact, the proof is related to that of the continuous time case. However, there is an interesting subtlety that appears here. Contrary to the continuous situation, it is not true now that the assumption that x 0 is an equilibrium state can be relaxed. In the paper <ref> [29] </ref>, remark 9.15, an example is given of an analytic system on XX = IR, with U = IR, and a state x 2 XX such that A (x) = XX but the system is not forward accessible from this x.

Reference-contexts: We sketch here how a similar result can be obtained for certain nonlinear systems, using the accessibility conditions given above. This is an improvement over the result in <ref> [30] </ref>, where only the case of bilinear systems was treated, and more importantly, where only transitivity conditions were obtained.

Reference-contexts: This provides the promised direct proof of part (b) of theorem 6. 30 8 Sampling In this section, we explain briefly how some of our results can be applied to the sampling problem. More details are given in the conference paper <ref> [31] </ref>. For other related facts about sampling, the reader should consult [19] and [21]. When a continuous time system is digitally controlled, decisions are often restricted to be taken at fixed times 0; ffi; 2ffi; :::; ffi &gt; 0 is the sampling time. <p> Thus accessibility under sampling corresponds to forward accessibility for a discrete time system derived from the corresponding and !. With this definition it is clear that !-accessibility for even a single ! implies accessibility. The following theorem from <ref> [31] </ref> provides a converse to this fact. The corollary is immediate from the theorem and the discussion given above about the largest frequency . Theorem 10 Assume that 2 ~ d is accessible from 0. <p> Corollary 8.1 Accessibility is preserved under sampling for systems in ~ d provided that the sampling frequency be larger than 2d + 2 times the largest natural frequency of the system. The reader is referred to <ref> [31] </ref> for the details of the reduction of the above theorem to the results given earlier in this paper. However, we wish to at least scketch this reduction here. <p> : : : ; g m ; [f; g 1 ]; : : : ; [f; g m ]; : : : ; ad k f (g 1 ); : : : ; ad k f (g m ); : : :g when ffi is as in theorem 10 (see <ref> [31] </ref> for details). It follows that ~ L + coincides with the strong accessibility Lie algebra associated to the original continuous time system, which has full rank at the origin due to the accessibility assumption.

Reference-contexts: This is analogous to associating a Lie algebra action to any given Lie group action. Other work along those lines was carried out in [11], <ref> [32] </ref>, [17], [29], and related papers. <p> The following "orbit theorem" is crucial in understanding such systems. The theorem has a long history starting with results of Chow, Nagano, ([23]), Sussmann ([34]) and Stefan ([33]) in the continuous time case. In the discrete time case analogous results to those in continuous time where provided in [9], <ref> [32] </ref>, [11], and [29], the latter containing also a proof of a more abstract result dealing with a general notion of action on manifolds.

Reference-contexts: Then W = f k 0 (V ) is also open and x 2 W . We will show that W is contained in the orbit through x of the Lie algebra L + (cf. <ref> [34] </ref>), which we denote by Orb L + (x). This will imply that the orbit is of dimension n and from a theorem of Nagano ([23],[34]) it will follow that dim L + (x) = n. Let y 2 W . <p> Then the iterated derivative of along the vector fields Y 1 ; : : : ; Y k can be estimated by z2D z2D z2D To prove this estimate we use a method of Sussmann <ref> [34] </ref> (proof of Lemma 4.2) which reduces the problem to Cauchy inequalities.
