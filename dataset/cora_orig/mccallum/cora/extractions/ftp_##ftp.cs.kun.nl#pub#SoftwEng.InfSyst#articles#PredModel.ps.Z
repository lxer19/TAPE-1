Abstract: In this paper we formalise data models that are based on the concept of predicator, the combination of an object type and a role. A very simple model, the Predicator Model, is introduced in a rigid formal way. We introduce the concept of population as an instantiation of an information structure. A primitive manipulation language is defined in the style of Relational Algebra. Well-known types of constraints are defined in terms of the algebra introduced, as restrictions on populations. They are given more expressive power than is usually the case.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Nowadays many techniques exist for the modelling of information structures. Some often used techniques have an underlying object-role model. Examples are: NIAM ([15], [30], [25]), the ER Approach ([3], [21]), and functional data models (e.g. FDM <ref> [6] </ref>). The information structure forms the kernel of the so-called conceptual model, and is considered an important milestone during the process of information analysis. Currently, workbenches are built that support the information analyst in the construction of the conceptual model.

Reference-contexts: Note that R is represented in this figure according to the same format as X 1 and X 2 . In this figure, the basic building element is the connection between an object type and a role, the so-called predicator (this term was first introduced in <ref> [7] </ref>). In figure 3, p 1 is the predicator connecting X 1 to r 1 , and p 2 the predicator that connects X 2 to r 2 .

Reference-contexts: A state of the UoD then corresponds with a so-called instantiation or population of the information structure, and vice versa. The idea of states was previously mentioned in <ref> [8] </ref>, [26], [22]. Furthermore, a state transition of the UoD has a corresponding transition on populations of the information structure.

Reference-contexts: The problem is to determine whether M contains a so-called matching, i.e. a subset M 0 M with q elements, such that no two elements of M 0 agree in any coordinate. This problem is known to be NP-complete (see <ref> [9] </ref>). Without loss of generality, we assume that every element of W , X and Y occurs in some element of M (which is easily checked). If this is not the case, no matching is possible.

Reference-contexts: The semantics of constraints will be expressed in terms of relational expressions. For related work, see [14]. Dynamic constraints exclude forbidden transitions. They are not considered in this paper. Several approaches exist for dynamic constraints, for example, temporal logic ([8]), predicate transition networks ([17], <ref> [10] </ref>) and algebraic specification ([1]). A schema = hI; Ci consists of an information structure I (the syntactical part) and a set of constraints C (the semantical part).

Reference-contexts: Thirdly, properties of object-role data modelling techniques or of the models expressed in such a technique, can not be proven. Comparison with other techniques or data models is impossible on a formal basis. For a more detailed discussion on these issues, see <ref> [11] </ref>. The organisation of this paper is as follows. First we introduce the Predicator Model. The Predicator Model is used to describe an information structure. The meaning of an information structure is described by the concept of instantiation (or population).

Reference-contexts: Cycles can be easily detected by the topological sort algorithm (see <ref> [12] </ref>), applied on the Object Relation Network: Theorem 5.4 Let G = hN; Ei be a directed graph, then G is acyclic iff there exists a function h : N !

Reference-contexts: This approach is known as the tuple oriented approach. A disadvantage of this approach is that algebraic operators lack useful properties as commutativity and associativity. The modern approach is to use the mapping mechanism to describe relations (the mapping oriented approach). See also <ref> [13] </ref>. In ER and NIAM a relation type is considered to be an association between object types. The graphical representation of a relation type, drawn in the NIAM style, is shown in figure 1. The corresponding ER diagram is shown in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Forbidden populations are excluded by so-called static constraints. We will discuss total role, uniqueness, occurrence frequency, exclusion, equality, subset and enumeration constraints. The semantics of constraints will be expressed in terms of relational expressions. For related work, see <ref> [14] </ref>. Dynamic constraints exclude forbidden transitions. They are not considered in this paper. Several approaches exist for dynamic constraints, for example, temporal logic ([8]), predicate transition networks ([17], [10]) and algebraic specification ([1]).

Reference-contexts: According to <ref> [15] </ref>, a population is called significant with respect to some kind of constraint if and only if all the relevant UoD constraints of that kind may be deduced from that population.

Reference-contexts: Schema ( q 1 :p 1 ;:::;q n :p n r) = fq 1 ; : : :; q n g 2. Pop ( q 1 :p 1 ;:::;q n :p n r) = t fi o This definition is in style with <ref> [18] </ref>. Note that the projection can be used to "rename" a predicator. Furthermore, the projection operator can be used to extend relations with new predicators. This is especially useful, when more sophisticated expressions are possible, to describe the value in a "new" predicator. <p> This operator is defined for the NF 2 data model in <ref> [18] </ref>. In the predicator model, we need an alternative definition. Let f; g be relational expressions, and p 2 Schema (g) a predicator such that Base (p) = Schema (f) (see figure 10). Let Schema (f ) = fp 1 ; : : : ; p n g.

Reference-contexts: Using this basic language, more sophisticated retrieval languages can be described, for example languages based on path expressions (such as RIDL, see <ref> [24] </ref> or [27]). The relational algebra R (I), associated with an information structure I, consists of the set of relational expressions on I. This set is introduced by an inductive definition.
