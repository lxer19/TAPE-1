Abstract: Document drafting|an important problem-solving task of professionals in a wide variety of fields|typifies a design task requiring complex adaptation for case reuse. This paper proposes a framework for document reuse based on an explicit representation of the illocutionary and rhetorical structure underlying documents. Explicit representation of this structure facilitates (1) interpretation of previous documents by enabling them to "explain themselves," (2) construction of documents by enabling document drafters to issue goal-based specifications and rapidly retrieve documents with similar intentional structure, and (3) mainte nance of multi-generation documents.

Reference-contexts: The formalization of inter-sentential discourse relations is a key requirement for the development of self-explaining documents. The most directly relevant portion of research in discourse structure is speech act theory. Initiated by J.L. Austin, who was primarily concerned with explicit performatives <ref> [Aus62] </ref>, speech act theory addresses the illocutionary content of discourse, that is, the goals that a speaker intends to accomplish through that discourse [Gri75, Sea69]. Illocutionary analysis is essential for self-explaining documents because few documents have an exclusively communicative purpose.

Reference-contexts: Early case-based reasoning systems, e.g., [Kol84, SW86, PBH90], typically addressed tasks, such as classification, that require little or no adaptation. By contrast, more recent CBR research has often addressed tasks such as design, planning, or configuration, that require complex adaptation, e.g., <ref> [Vel92, BS95, SK95, BA95] </ref>. Document drafting typifies a design task requiring complex adaptation for case reuse.

Reference-contexts: The theory of argumentation addresses texts intended to persuade, establish, or prove. For example, Toulmin [Tou58] analyzed argumentative texts in terms of the concepts of warrant, ground, conclusion, backing, and qualification. This model has been widely applied to the analysis [Mar89, ZS95] and creation <ref> [BCS95] </ref> of legal documents. Argument structure, like other forms of illocution-ary goal structure but unlike rhetorical structure, does not directly address the "surface" form of texts.

Reference-contexts: Argument structure, like other forms of illocution-ary goal structure but unlike rhetorical structure, does not directly address the "surface" form of texts.

The explanation community has extensively studied the process of planning and realizing text given a set of discourse specifications.

Reference-contexts: When this process is complete, we will undertake the construction of each component of the architecture. To supply a uniform representation for all of the knowledge structures, all illocutionary structures, rhetorical structures, and planning operators will be implemented in a unification-based constraint system <ref> [Elh91] </ref>. As a result of the single representation, all adaptation procedures (document compilation and consistency checking) will be performed with a single mechanism: constraint propagation.
