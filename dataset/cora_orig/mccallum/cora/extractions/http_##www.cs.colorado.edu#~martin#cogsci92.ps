Reference-contexts: These sets of metaphoric associations, along with the concepts that comprise the source and target domains, are represented using the kodiak (Wilensky, 1986) representation language. kodiak is an extended semantic network language in the tradition of kl-one <ref> (Brachman and Schmolze, 1985) </ref> and its variants. The details of kodiak and the representation of metaphoric knowledge will be described in Section 6.1. These sets of metaphoric associations representing conventional metaphors are full-fledged kodiak concepts.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, there is no experimental evidence to indicate that there is a radical difference between the time taken to interpret metaphorical language and that taken to interpret direct non-metaphorical language. This constraint has been referred to as the total time constraint <ref> (Gerrig, 1989) </ref>. This rough equivalence of time to process was taken as one of the basic constraints in the development of midas.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a further constraint was adopted that the mechanisms developed for interpreting metaphoric language should be fundamentally the same as those assumed for direct non-metaphoric language. The second result of interest has to do with the non-optionality of metaphorical interpretations. The studies of Glucksberg <ref> (Glucksberg et al., 1982) </ref> and Keysar (Keysar, 1989) have shown that metaphorical interpretations may be generated even when there is a well-formed and pragmatically appropriate literal interpretation.

Reference-contexts: The second result of interest has to do with the non-optionality of metaphorical interpretations. The studies of Glucksberg (Glucksberg et al., 1982) and Keysar <ref> (Keysar, 1989) </ref> have shown that metaphorical interpretations may be generated even when there is a well-formed and pragmatically appropriate literal interpretation. More specifically they show 6 that metaphorical interpretations are produced when they are consistent with the context regardless of the well-formedness of a literal interpretation.

Reference-contexts: Under this view, the proper way to approach the study of metaphor is to study the underlying details of individual metaphors and systems of metaphors in the language. This approach follows on the metaphor work of Lakoff and Johnson <ref> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) </ref> and the computational approaches to metaphor described in (Jacobs, 1985; Martin, 1986; Martin, 1987; Martin, 1988; Norvig, 1987). It is useful here to consider an analogy between the study of metaphor and the study of syntax. <p> Within the unix domain this is simply one instance of a more general metaphor that permits interactive programs to be viewed as enclosures or environments. At an even higher level of abstraction, this metaphor is an instance of the pervasive Container metaphor <ref> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) </ref> found throughout English. Consider the following examples. (7) How can I get into emacs? (8) John got into Columbia. (9) Jackson entered the presidential race today. <p> These more abstract metaphors typically have a fairly specific physical source domain coupled with an abstract target. Examples of abstract metaphors known to mi-das are container, possession and location metaphors for representing states <ref> (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) </ref>. In the following example, the system has knowledge of the Have-State metaphor. This metaphor represents the widespread metaphor that the concept of being in some state can be expressed as a possession.

Reference-contexts: The focus of the remainder of this article is on the representation and use of metaphoric knowledge to interpret known conventional metaphors. Details of the midas approach to the acquisition of new metaphors can be found in (Martin, 1990). Lakoff and Turner <ref> (Lakoff and Turner, 1988) </ref> address the general issue of the relationship between well-known conventional metaphors and novel poetic metaphor. 6 Knowledge Representation Details This section first provides a brief description of the kodiak representation language, it then reviews some of the systematic aspects of conventional metaphor that need to be captured,

Reference-contexts: However, the process model developed in this thesis gives rise naturally to an intermediate stage of representation that does correspond to part of Wilensky's primal content. A more complete discussion of the role of the primal representation and its relation to Wilensky's is given in <ref> (Martin, 1988) </ref> 26 7.1.2 Interpretation The interpretation process consists of deciding which of the concepts that are conventionally associated with the primal concept can most coherently account for the constraints imposed by the primal input. Possible candidate interpretations arise from two main sources. <p> The details of the initial syntactic processing and semantic interpretation not related to metaphor interpretation are omitted from the following trace.

Reference-contexts: The motivations for its development and its theoretical underpinnings are best described in (Wilensky, 1986). The actual implementation described here is a modified version of the one developed by Norvig <ref> (Norvig, 1987) </ref> for the faustus text inferencing system.

Reference-contexts: The process of disambiguating this kind of example must be performed by an interpreter that has full access to the discourse context. A context-sensitive text inference system like faustus (Norvig, 1987; Norvig, 1989) or dmap <ref> (Riesbeck and Martin, 1985) </ref> could accept the ambiguous meanings from the interpreter and choose one based on how well it fits into the current context. There is insufficient information in the single sentence given above to allow midas to choose one of the meanings.

Reference-contexts: Note that the computational costs of these analogy mechanisms are radically higher than those posed for direct non-metaphorical language. While the details of each approach differ, they are all fundamentally based on the stage model <ref> (Searle, 1979) </ref> where the literal meaning of the sentence is computed and judged to be ill-formed, and then an analogy system is employed to search for an appropriate target meaning. The metaphoric knowledge approach taken in midas is an attempt to fuse the advantages of each of these approaches.

Reference-contexts: In this example, the source component of the metaphor is attached to the concept of being enclosed, not to the lexical item in. These sets of metaphoric associations, along with the concepts that comprise the source and target domains, are represented using the kodiak <ref> (Wilensky, 1986) </ref> representation language. kodiak is an extended semantic network language in the tradition of kl-one (Brachman and Schmolze, 1985) and its variants.
