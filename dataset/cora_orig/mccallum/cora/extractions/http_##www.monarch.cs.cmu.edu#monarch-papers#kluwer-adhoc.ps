Title: Dynamic Source Routing in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

Abstract: An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration. In such an environment, it may be necessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts in forwarding a packet to its destination, due to the limited range of each mobile host's wireless transmissions. This paper presents a protocol for routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. The protocol adapts quickly to routing changes when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in which hosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-level simulation of mobile hosts operating in an ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions such as host density and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of host movement simulated, the overhead of the protocol is quite low, falling to just 1% of total data packets transmitted for moderate movement rates in a network of 24 mobile hosts. In all cases, the difference in length between the routes used and the optimal route lengths is negligible, and in most cases, route lengths are on average within a factor of 1.01 of optimal.

Reference-contexts: In a wireless environment, network transmission between two hosts does not necessarily work equally well in both directions, due to differing propagation or interference patterns around the two hosts <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. For example, with distance vector routing, even though a host may receive a routing advertisement from another mobile host, packets it might then transmit back to that host for forwarding may not be able to reach it. <p> Instead, while a route is in use, the route maintenance procedure monitors the operation of the route and informs the sender of any routing errors. 5 Since wireless networks are inherently less reliable than wired networks <ref> [1] </ref>, many wireless networks utilize a hop-by-hop acknowledgement at the data link level in order to provide early detection and retransmission of lost or corrupted packets.

Reference-contexts: Our protocol does not require transmissions between hosts to work bidirectionally, although we do make use of it when afforded, for example, by MAC-level protocols such as MACA [13] or MACAW <ref> [2] </ref> that ensure it. Finally, conventional routing protocols are not designed for the type of dynamic topology changes that may be present in ad hoc networks. <p> The simulator does not attempt to model channel contention. Given a suitable data link layer protocol such as MACAW <ref> [2] </ref>, the chance of data being lost to collision during periods of channel contention grows small, although at the expense of more delay in packet sending and receipt as each host waits for its turn to use the bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: This limitation on the maximum rate of route discoveries for the same target is similar to the mechanism required by Internet hosts to limit the rate at which ARP requests are sent to any single IP address <ref> [3] </ref>. An additional optimization possible to improve the handling of errors is to use promiscuous receive mode to allow hosts to eavesdrop on route error packets being sent to other hosts. For example, Figure 4 shows the return of a route error packet to mobile host A from host B.

Reference-contexts: Routing protocols in conventional wired networks generally use either distance vector or link state routing algorithms, both of which require periodic routing advertisements to be broadcast by each router. In distance vector routing <ref> [9, 17, 26, 27, 29] </ref>, each router broadcasts to each of its neighbor routers its view of the distance to all hosts, and each router computes the shortest path to each host based on the information advertised by each of its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: In link state routing <ref> [10, 16, 18] </ref>, each router instead broadcasts to all other routers in the network its view of the status of each of its adjacent network links, and each router then computes the shortest distance to each host based on the complete picture of the network formed from the most recent link

Reference-contexts: In addition to its use in wired networks, the basic distance vector algorithm has also been adapted for routing in wireless ad hoc networks, essentially treating each mobile host as a router <ref> [11, 19, 25] </ref>. This paper describes the design and performance of a routing protocol for ad hoc networks that instead uses dynamic source routing of packets between hosts that want to communicate. <p> In addition, many of the links between routers seen by the routing algorithm may be redundant <ref> [11] </ref>. Wired networks are usually explicitly configured to have only one (or a small number) of routers connecting any two networks, but there are no explicit links in an ad hoc network, and all communication is by broadcast transmissions. <p> For example, in Figure 1, host A may be able to hear B's transmission of the packet on to C. This type of acknowledgement is known as a passive acknowledgement <ref> [11] </ref>. In addition, existing transport or application level replies or acknowl-edgements from the original destination could also be used as an acknowledgement that the route (or that hop of the route) is still working. <p> Related Work Research on packet routing in wireless networks of mobile hosts dates back at least to 1973 when the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency began the DARPA Packet Radio Network (PRNET) project <ref> [11] </ref> and its successor the Survivable Adaptive Networks (SURAN) project [15]. PRNET supports the automatic set up and maintenance of packet switched communication routes in a network of moderately mobile hosts communicating via radios.
