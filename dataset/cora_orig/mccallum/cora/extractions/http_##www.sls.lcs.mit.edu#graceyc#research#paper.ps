Abstract: We describe a novel hierarchical duration model for speech recognition. The modelling scheme is based on the angie framework, a flexible unified sublexical representation for speech applications. Our duration model captures contextual factors that influence duration of sublexical units at multiple linguistic levels simultaneously, using both relative and absolute duration information. The mod-elling procedure involves a normalization scheme which produces a new measure for relative speaking rate at a word level. This may be used to explore phenomena in speech timing and we present studies on secondary effects of speaking rate here. This duration model demonstrates its ability to aid speech recognition in phonetic recognition experiments where it has yielded a relative improvement of up to 7.7%. In word spotting, a study employing duration as a post-processor in disambiguating between 2 acoustically similar keywords reduces relative error by 68%. Furthermore, a fully integrated duration model in an angie based word spotter improves performance by 21.5%. All gains are over and above any gains realized from standard phone duration models present in the baseline system. All experiments were conducted in the atis domain, using continuous spontaneous speech.

Reference-contexts: The duration model is incorporated into a speech recognizer and our experiments show that duration offers substantial performance gains in both phonetic recognition and word spotting, thereby demonstrating the value of duration as an aid to speech recognition. For further details, consult <ref> [2] </ref>. 2. THE ANGIE FRAMEWORK Angie is a trainable probabilistic paradigm in which word substructures are jointly characterized by a context-free grammar and are represented in a multi-layered hierarchical structure. An example is shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: An example is shown in Figure 1. The upper layers capture syllabification, morphology, and stress, while the preterminal layer represents phonemics, and the bottom terminal categories are phones. Further details of the probability model and grammar are described in <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. 3. THE DURATION MODEL Durational relationships of sublexical units encode linguistic information, residing at various levels of the phonological hierarchy. In order to extract this information, one must be able to identify and account for all the linguistic factors that operate simultaneously on a segment. <p> WORD SPOTTING As a first step towards deomonstrating the benefit of duration to word recognition, we choose to evaluate our model in word spotting using an angie based system described in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Fully Integrated System The same duration model is fully integrated into the angie based word spotter in which the model is employed for a full set of keywords. These experiments are detailed in <ref> [3] </ref>. The best performance yielded a 21.5% improvement from 89.3 to 91.6 (FOM), by employing a combination of the absolute and relative duration models. This suggests that duration can be applied in a more general task and still yield substantial gains.

In the angie recognizer, pseudo-words are proposed periodically, at which point the duration component is called to produce a duration score. This score is a linear combination of scores derived individually from the relative and absolute duration models.
