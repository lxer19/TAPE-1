Title: CONSISTENCY IN QUANTIZED MATCHING PURSUIT  
Author: Vivek K Goyal Martin Vetterli

Abstract: This paper explores the effects of coefficient quantization in applying the matching pursuit algorithm to source coding of vectors in R N . By considering the issue of consistency, we find that even though matching pursuit is designed to produce a linear combination to estimate a given source vector, optimal reconstruction in the presence of coefficient quantization requires a nonlinear algorithm. Such an algorithm was implemented and was experimentally confirmed to have superior reconstruction properties in comparison to the standard linear reconstruction. The improvement depends on the source, dictionary and operating point; in some cases the MSE was lessened by as much as a factor of five.

Reference-contexts: 1. MATCHING PURSUIT Matching pursuit is an algorithm for finding linear combinations that approximate a given signal vector. It was introduced to the signal processing community in the context of time-frequency analysis by Mallat and Zhang <ref> [1] </ref>. Mallat and his students have uncovered many of its properties [2]. Let D = f' k g M k=1 R N span R N . Also impose the additional constraint that k' k k = 1 for all k. We will call D our dictionary of vectors.

Note that the output of a matching pursuit expansion is not only the coefficients (ff 0 , ff 1 , : : : ), but also the indices (k 0 , k 1 , : : : ).

Reference-contexts: For storage and transmission purposes, the indices must be accounted for. 2. QUANTIZED MATCHING PURSUIT Although matching pursuit has been applied to low bit rate compression problems <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>, which inherently require coarse coefficient quantization, little work has been done to understand the qualitative effects of coefficient quantization in matching pursuit. In this section we explore some of these effects. The issue of consistency in these expansions is explored in x2.2.

Reference-contexts: In practice, this is an overly broad problem. 2.2. Consistency Let Q : X ! Y be a quantization function. We say that ^x 2 X is a consistent estimate of x 2 X, or a consistent reconstruction, if Q (^x) = Q (x) <ref> [6] </ref>. In words, we would say that an estimate is consistent if it has the same quantized To appear in Proc.

Reference-contexts: The consistency of reconstruction was checked for two iteration expansions. Dictionary sizes of M = 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 were used. The results are shown in dashed curves were generated using dictionaries of maximally spaced points <ref> [8] </ref>. For both types of dictionaries, the probability of inconsistency goes to one for very coarse quantization and goes to zero as ! 0. The qualitative difference between the curves indicates that there are complicated geometric factors involved. 2.3. <p> Similar expressions hold for other cases. The experiments involved quantization of a zero mean i.i.d. Gaussian source. Dictionaries were formed from <ref> [8] </ref>. Source vectors were generated by forming blocks of N samples.
