Reference-contexts: of the number of non-native speakers in other languages will be made during Phase II. "Extraneous speech" refers to background speech produced by someone other than the caller. 1 The speech tools used in the development of this corpus are described in detail in the Proceedings of this onference in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 The laboratory assistants were trained to recognize the fixed vocabularies in each lan-guage and were able to detect incomplete responses and non-standard pronunciations of the days-of-the-week and the numbers.
