Abstract: We consider the efficient implementation of mixed finite elements for solving second order elliptic partial differential equations on geometrically general domains, concentrating on the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas approximating spaces. We consider the standard mixed method and its hybrid form, and the recently introduced expanded mixed method. The standard method yields a saddle-point linear system, and while the hybrid method yields a positive definite linear system, it has many more unknowns, one per element edge or face. The expanded mixed method is similar in its structure; however, we give a generalization of the method combined with a global mapping technique that makes it suitable for general meshes. Moreover, two quadrature rules are given which reduce the method to a cell-centered finite difference method on meshes of quadrilaterals or triangles in 2 dimensions and hexahedra or tetrahedra in 3 dimensions. This approach substantially reduces the complexity of the mixed finite element matrix, leaving a symmetric, positive definite system for only as many unknowns as elements. On smooth meshes that are either logically rectangular or triangular with six triangles per internal vertex, this finite difference method is as accurate as the standard mixed method; on non-smooth meshes it can lose accuracy. An enhancement of the method is defined that combines numerical quadrature with Lagrange multiplier pressures on certain element edges or faces. The enhanced method regains the accuracy of the solution on non-smooth meshes, with little additional cost if the mesh geometry is piece-wise smooth, as in hierarchical meshes. Theoretical error estimates and numerical examples are given comparing the accuracy and efficiency of the methods. 1. Introduction. We discuss several variations of the mixed finite element

The mixed finite element spaces are defined in the standard way on the reference partition and by Piola transformation on the curved elements.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between the mixed method and cell-centered finite differences on rectangular grids was first established in [32] under the assumption that K in (1.1) is a scalar or a diagonal matrix, and later in general in <ref> [2] </ref> for a variant of the mixed method, the "expanded mixed method" [37, 25, 10, 2]. The primary mixed finite element methods on general geometry 3 restrictive assumption is that the mesh is rectangular. <p> The relationship between the mixed method and cell-centered finite differences on rectangular grids was first established in [32] under the assumption that K in (1.1) is a scalar or a diagonal matrix, and later in general in [2] for a variant of the mixed method, the "expanded mixed method" <ref> [37, 25, 10, 2] </ref>. The primary mixed finite element methods on general geometry 3 restrictive assumption is that the mesh is rectangular. <p> This method achieves super-convergence (also called supra-convergence) at certain discrete points for both the pressure and velocity approximations <ref> [35, 26, 36, 2] </ref>, and the number of unknowns is reduced to the number of cells or elements (which is much less than the number of edges or faces). <p> In the recently introduced expanded mixed method <ref> [37, 25, 10, 2] </ref>, we need an additional finite element space ~ V h such that V h ~ V h (L 2 ()) d . <p> In fact, the method reduces to the standard cell-centered finite difference method, with only as many unknowns as elements (up to some additional unknowns near N ). Moreover, the accuracy of the approximate solutions is not compromised [36]. Recently, these ideas were exploited for (3.3.4) to obtain similar results <ref> [2] </ref>. Trapezoidal quadrature was applied to the integrals (3.3.5)-(3.3.6) defining A 1 and A 2 , so that A 2 is diagonal when G is the identity. In the next four sections, we remove the restriction to rectangular meshes. <p> For geometrically irregular domains, the transformed coefficient is necessarily a full tensor except in trivial cases. However, because of our choice (5.4) of G, the expanded problem on the computational grid (5.6) is the same as that analyzed in <ref> [2] </ref>. There, a finite difference stencil is derived for the pressure, when trapezoidal quadrature rules are used for evaluating three of the integrals. We exploit this result on general geometry. Take ~ V h = V h , so that A 2 of (3.3.6) is square and invertible. <p> We exploit this result on general geometry. Take ~ V h = V h , so that A 2 of (3.3.6) is square and invertible. The scheme proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> approximating (5.6) on the computational domain is (5.6c)-(5.6d) combined with ( ^ U; ^ ~v) ^ ;TM = (J DF 1 K (DF 1 ) T ^ ~ U; ^ ~v) ^ ;T ; ^ ~v 2 ( ^ ~ U; ^v) ^ ;TM ( ^ P ; ^ r <p> The next theorem (with a modification for the lower order term) can be found in <ref> [2] </ref> (cf.

Other known estimates in the H s and L p norms for affine and special boundary elements <ref> [16, 6, 7, 20, 2] </ref> can also be transformed for curved elements by these techniques. <p> The following definition concerning mesh refinement is needed for the next two results (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>). Definition 8.4. For ` 1, an asymptotic family of meshes is said to be generated by a C ` map if each mesh is an image by a fixed map F of a mesh that is composed of standard, regular reference elements. <p> Proof.

Remark. The above results imply L 2 super-convergence for the computed pressure, velocity, and its divergence at the midpoints of the elements. The normal component of the velocity at the midpoints of the edges or faces is also super-convergent. <p> The normal component of the velocity at the midpoints of the edges or faces is also super-convergent. Moreover, full second order super-convergence of the velocities is obtained in the strict interior of the domain <ref> [2; Theorem 5.10] </ref>. Theorem 8.6.

Reference-contexts: In the hybrid method, Lagrange multiplier pressures are introduced on the boundary of every element in E h .

A similar situation arises when applying the domain decomposition techniques described in <ref> [22] </ref>, where La-grange multipliers are introduced only on the element faces between sub-domains. In the enhanced method, the multipliers are needed to preserve accuracy of the numerical solution; however, as a side effect, they can be used to introduce parallelism into the solution process. <p> The resulting linear system for the pressures can be further reduced to an equation for Lagrange pressures alone.

Reference-contexts: A new post processing scheme developed by the third author recovers extra accuracy for the velocities on triangular meshes as well <ref> [24] </ref>. The post-processing method can be applied to any of the mixed method variants. The convergence rate for the post processed flux is generally between h 1:5 and h 2 , depending in part on the smoothness of the mesh refinement process.

Reference-contexts: In petroleum reservoir simulation, mixed finite element methods disguised as cell-centered finite difference methods have been the standard approach for many years [30]. The relationship between the mixed method and cell-centered finite differences on rectangular grids was first established in <ref> [32] </ref> under the assumption that K in (1.1) is a scalar or a diagonal matrix, and later in general in [2] for a variant of the mixed method, the "expanded mixed method" [37, 25, 10, 2]. <p> This situation occurred for the standard mixed method. As mentioned in the introduction, in the special case of RT 0 , rectangular elements, and a diagonal (or scalar) K, applying the trapezoidal-midpoint (TM) quadrature rule to (3.1.3) reduces A to a diagonal matrix <ref> [32] </ref>. The full matrix in (3.1.8) then becomes sparse with nonzero entries on five bands, and the cost of applying an iterative procedure to the solution of (3.1.8) is greatly reduced.

Reference-contexts: We also assess the accuracy of the mehod, and compare it to and improve it with the hybrid formulation. Thomas' approach <ref> [34] </ref> was to partition locally into elements with straight edges and then to map each to a reference element by an affine or a multi-linear mapping.

The construction 10 arbogast, dawson, keenan, wheeler, and yotov of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements is more involved, and we review here the basic theory of Thomas <ref> [34] </ref>.
