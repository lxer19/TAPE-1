Abstract: Over the last two decades NYU has assembled a strong group of program-ming language researchers. Their contributions are many: optimizing compilers, high level programming languages (set-theoretic language, SETL and functional programming languages), program transformation and development of very practical compliers (some examples: SPITBOL and COBOL compilers, Ada/Ed compiler and most recently a full GNU Ada Compiler). One notable achievement is our Ada/Ed compiler that holds the distinction of being the first officially-approved full Ada compiler! The same Ada/Ed team, lead by Ed Schonberg and Robert Dewar, has taken up the language and compiler design tasks for GNU Ada 95. With the changes in the computing environment and the advent of Internet, the research and development styles in these areas have also changed. Ed Schonberg in the following essay reflects on this unique experience.
