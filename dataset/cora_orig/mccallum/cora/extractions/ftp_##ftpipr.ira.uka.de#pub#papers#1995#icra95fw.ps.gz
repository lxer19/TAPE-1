Abstract: A good map of its environment is essential for efficient task execution of a mobile robot. Real-time map update, especially in dynamic scenes is a difficult problem due to noisy sensor data and limited observation time. This paper describes a mapping procedure which identifies new obstacles in a scene and constructs a 3-D surface model of it. This description is included in the geometrical map, robot navigation relies on. The mapping procedure is based on sonar range information and scenes reconstructed from stereo vision. Combination of sonar and stereo vision is advantagous due to a complementary error characteristics concerning range and angular resolution. For sonar data integration the idea of local probability grids is proposed. Local grids which only cover areas where new obstacles are expected, reduce complexity of grid based sonar data integration and can such be applied to dynamic environment. The partial models of an object that has been observed from different viewpoints are fused to a homogeneous description in a later step. A complex example shows the mapping procedure work robustly in dynamic indoor environments.

Reference-contexts: However, the large number of cells necessary for precise mapping results in time-consuming grid update procedures. Apart from simplified grid based approaches used for collision avoidance <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, certainty grid approaches have not been able to deal with dynamic environments so far. To overcome that problem the idea of local grids was developed. It is based on the assumption, that grid areas are mainly of interest in regions, where new obstacles are.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, grid interpretation is improved by comparing the edges found. An edge is represented by mid-point m, orientation ff and length d as proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Five edge configurations are considered when improving parameteri-sation: Equal: Both edges describe the same part of an object. m and ff as well as d are fused to describe one single edge. In: Two edges are Equal but one edge is significantly shorter.

Reference-contexts: Newly observed obstacles are included in four steps in the robot's world map. In a first step, new obstacles are identified by comparing predictions of range measurements with real data. As soon as a new obstacle is expected, a probability grid <ref> [5] </ref> which covers that area is generated for further integration of range data. If a grid clearly indicates the presence of a yet unknown obstacle, a stereo-snapshot of that region is taken. The reconstructed 3-D scene is then fused with the parametrical model derived from the probability grid.

Reference-contexts: than once and the measured range is closer than the prediction the mapping process is initiated. 3 The Local Grid Concept In the literature two principles are described how to integrate new sonar data in a geometric world model: Parametric approaches usually use a surface or volumetric description of objects <ref> [7] </ref>. Though such a description is appealing due to its simplicity, it is difficult to integrate new objects. The problem is to gain a parametric description from only little data. Large errors in object models are a consequence which is later difficult to correct.

Reference-contexts: Large errors in object models are a consequence which is later difficult to correct. An attractive method to fuse sensor data taken at different times, from different positions and even by different sensor systems is offered by certainty grids <ref> [8, 11] </ref>. In certainty grids space is represented by a grid with each cell holding a value corresponding to the probability that an obstacle is located in that region. However, the large number of cells necessary for precise mapping results in time-consuming grid update procedures. <p> Such a grid is enlarged if later measurements make it necessary, split if a grid is detected to cover two obstacles as well as fused, if two grids belong to the same obstacle. Integration of range data is performed according to the procedure described in <ref> [8] </ref> with a probability increment at the echo region and a probability decrement where no reflection occured.

Reference-contexts: According to the grid location a snapshot of this region is requested from the stereo vision head as soon as grid probability exceeds a predefined threshold. Low-level image interpretation as well as stereo matching and 3-D scene reconstruction is described in detail in <ref> [10] </ref>. Precision of stereo vision based scene reconstruction is limited by the pixel size on the CCD chip.
