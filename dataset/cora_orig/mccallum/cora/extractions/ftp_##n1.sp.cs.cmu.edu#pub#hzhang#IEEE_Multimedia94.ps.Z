Abstract: Network-based real-time multimedia applications require guaranteed performance communication services. To provide guaranteed service, resources have to be reserved within the network. If reservation is based on the peak rate of each connection, the network will be under-utilized by guaranteed service traffic when the traffic is bursty. In this paper, we first show that local deterministic delay bounds can be guaranteed over a link for bursty traffic even when the sum of the peak rates of all the connections is greater than the link speed. Compared to previous admission control conditions, the new result allows a multi-fold increase in the number of admitted connections when the traffic is bursty. We then show that this new result can be efficiently extended from a single switch to a network of arbitrary topology by using rate-controlled service disciplines at the switches.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to characterize the traffic pattern distortion inside the network, and derive the traffic characterization at the entrance to each switch from the characterization of the source traffic and the traffic pattern distortion. This approach, taken in <ref> [4, 1, 15, 14] </ref>, has several limitations. First, it only applies to networks with constant delay links. Constant delay links have the desirable property that the traffic pattern at the receiving end of the link is the same as that at the transmitting end of the link.

Reference-contexts: It should be noticed that these numbers are reasonable for compressed video. Recent video traffic trace study shows that the peak-to-average-rate ratio for VBR video is 1.5 - 4 <ref> [2, 13] </ref>. Also, for MPEG [10], the interval between two intra-frame-coding frames (I frames) is normally between 3 to 9 frame sizes, which corresponds to 99 ms to 298 ms when the video is played at 30 frames per second.

Reference-contexts: The best-effort service provided by the current packet-switching networks is not adequate. New services are needed. Two types of new services have been proposed in the literature to support real-time multimedia applications: guaranteed service [9] and predicted service <ref> [3] </ref>. In a guaranteed service model, client-specified a priori performance bounds are guaranteed to each connection regardless of the behaviors of other connections. In a predicted service model, a network dictated post facto delay bound and playback point are provided to the communication client. <p> From the network's point of view, the cost of providing a service depends on the maximum network utilization that can be achieved. Although it is argued that the predicted service would allow a higher network utilization by real-time traffic than guaranteed service <ref> [3] </ref>, since there is no complete description of the algorithms for the predicted service, especially the admission control algorithms, there are no quantitative comparisons available. In [6], two types of guaranteed services are proposed: deterministic service and statistical service.

Reference-contexts: Thus, these solutions do not apply to an internetworking environment. Second, most of these solutions apply only to a restricted class of networks. Characterizing the traffic pattern inside the network is equivalent to solving a set of multi-variable equations <ref> [5, 15, 14] </ref>. In a feedback network, where traffic from different channels form traffic loops, the resulting set of equations may be unsolvable. Thus, most of these solutions apply only to feed-forward networks or a restricted class of feedback networks.

Reference-contexts: The scheduler then orders the transmission of eligible real-time packets from all channels. Many types of regulators and schedulers can be used.

Reference-contexts: The detail of the proof is given in <ref> [19] </ref>. <p> This matches our intuition that higher burst ratios provide more opportunity for statistical multiplexing but result in lower network utilization in order to meet a specific performance guarantee. Similar results can be obtained for statistical service <ref> [19, 22] </ref>. 5 Providing end-to-end deterministic guar antees In the previous section, we showed that even for simple service disciplines like FCFS, deterministic delay bounds can be obtained when the sum of the peak rates of all the channels is greater than the link bandwidth. <p> Another solution to the traffic pattern distortion problem, which we adopt in our approach, is to reconstruct the traffic pattern at each switch with a class of non-work-conserving service disciplines called rate-controlled service disciplines <ref> [19] </ref>. As shown in Figure 6, a rate-controlled service discipline consists of two components, a rate-controller and a scheduler. The rate-controller shapes the input traffic from each channel into the desired traffic pattern by assigning an eligibility time to each packet. <p> Most non-work-conserving disciplines proposed for high speed networks such as Delay-EDD [18], Stop-and-Go [11], Hierarchical Round Robin [12], and Rate-Controlled Static Priority [20], either belong to this class, or can be implemented by a rate-controlled service discipline with the appropriate choices of rate-controllers and schedulers <ref> [19] </ref>. Rate-controlled service disciplines have the following two properties: (1) If a channel's traffic satisfies certain traffic characteristics at the entrance to the network, with use of the ap propriate rate-controllers, the same characteristics will be satisfied by the traffic at the entrance to each of schedulers along the path. <p> This allows us to perform delay analysis at each scheduler using the same traffic characterization. (2) The end-to-end delay of a packet in a network with rate-controlled servers consists of the following components: waiting time in the schedulers, holding time in the rate-controllers and the link delays. In <ref> [19] </ref>, it is shown that the end-to-end delay can be bounded by the sum of bounds on link delays and bounds on waiting time in the sched-ulers; holding packets in rate-controllers will not increase the end-to-end delay bound, although it may increase the end-to-end average delay. <p> Property (2) means that we can combine the delay analysis of each individual scheduler and obtain the end-to-end delay characteristics of a channel. This applies to both deterministic and statistical analysis <ref> [19] </ref>. 6 Discussion In previous sections, we showed that even for simple service disciplines like FCFS, deterministic delay bounds can be obtained when the sum of the peak rates of all the channels is greater than the link bandwidth. <p> If only one delay bound is provided as in the case of FCFS, the delay bound has to satisfy the most stringent requirement among all the channels, and will therefore under-utilize the network when the requirements of channels are different. In <ref> [20, 19] </ref>, it has been shown that the Rate-Controlled Static Priority (RCSP), which consists of a rate-controller and a static priority scheduler, strikes a good balance between simplicity of implementation and flexibility in allocating bandwidths and delay bounds to different channels; also, it can achieve a reasonably high average utilization for <p> Two solutions can be adopted to enhance the utilization of the network by guaranteed performance traffic. If applications can tolerate certain losses of data without significantly affecting the quality, statistical services can be provided to achieve a higher average network utilization by exploiting statistical multiplexing <ref> [9, 17, 19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As shown in <ref> [7, 21] </ref>, many service disciplines can be used to provide real-time service.

Although putting traffic policing function at all network access points will prevent misbehaving users from affecting other users, traffic distortions due to network fluctuations suggest that protection should be implemented within the network using rate-based service disciplines <ref> [21] </ref>, for example, rate-controlled disciplines as discussed in Section 5. The second reason FCFS is not enough is that an FCFS server can only offer a single value of delay bound for all the channels. However, the performance requirements for integrated services networks will be diverse.
