Reference-contexts: Although it would certainly have been impossible to carry out the research reported here without the benefit of an implemented environment like that provided by the CLE, much of the CLE's internal structure is at best of only tangential interest in this context; since the CLE is well-described elsewhere <ref> (Alshawi 1992) </ref>, we will confine ourselves to providing sufficient detail that the reader will be able to see where the translation and reasoning components fit into the total scheme. <p> QLF can be characterized as a logical representation which attempts to encode only the linguistic information in the utterance; this implies that QLF representations of vague expressions like pronouns and ellipsis are themselves vague <ref> (Alshawi and Crouch 1992) </ref>. We will actually have little to say about QLF in this thesis, since it is a level of representation that is difficult to use directly to support inferential reasoning.

Reference-contexts: There are basically three problems, which to some extent are related. Firstly, it is easy to spend excessive amounts of time in infinite branches of the search tree, especially ones resulting from "transitivity" axioms (cf <ref> (Appelt and Hobbs 90) </ref>), and Horn-clause readings of axioms of the form (p (X; Y ) p (X; Z)) q (Y; Z) (cf Section 4.6.5). <p> The method is sound, since its only effect is to devote less effort to search of the affected branches without cutting them off completely, and appears rather more general than the approach advocated in <ref> (Appelt and Hobbs 90) </ref>, which involves recoding of the meaning postulates. The loop avoidance method described above is strong enough that it is at any rate possible to consider using both forward and backward versions of equivalences.

Reference-contexts: The best-known variant of this idea is that pioneered by Hobbs and his colleagues under the name of "Interpreta-tion as Abduction" <ref> (Hobbs et al 1988) </ref> and embodied in the SRI TACTITUS system. (Other similar work is that of Charniak and Goldman (1988)).

Reference-contexts: The drawback is that Horn-clauses are "if" rules; they give conditions for the LF's being true, but <ref> (as pointed out in Konolige 1981) </ref>, they lack the "only if" half that says when they are false. This means that they can normally only be used to justify positive answers to questions; there is no easy way to distinguish between "no" and "don't know" in a pure Horn-clause theory. <p> Finally section 2.6 considers the connection between AET and the Closed World Assumption. 2.3 Ontological issues We start by defining the basic ontology underlying the linguistic domain theory; the ideas are closely related to those proposed in <ref> (Konolige 1981) </ref>. We assume as usual that there is a set of objects, O, and a set of relations obtaining between them, R.

Reference-contexts: Rules with negated heads are only invoked to attempt to identify inconsistent uses of assumptions (cf. Section 3.5). 5.2 Search strategies for inference In this section we consider the search strategy used in the inference engine, which as already stated is an iterated-deepening A* (IDA*) search strategy <ref> (Korf, 1986, Stickel, 1986) </ref>; that is, search proceeds by first defining a cost limit D, and then performing a depth-first search where each branch is cut off when the sum of the cost of goals already processed, together with an estimate of the cost of solving pending goals, exceeds D.

Reference-contexts: It is thus pleasant to be able to say that a second AET application, a CLARE interface to the AUTOROUTE route-finding package, has now been constructed. This is being reported elsewhere <ref> (Lewin et al 1993) </ref>. It is particularly gratifying that nearly all the work was carried out by project personnel (primarily Ian Lewin) who had not participated in the development of the PRM application.

Reference-contexts: We illustrate with a sketch of the standard example, "finding out someone's telephone number" (cf e.g. <ref> (McCarthy 1977) </ref>, (Moore 1985)). Simplifying as much as possible (and side-stepping some of the temporal reasoning issues without comment), we start by letting be the background theory as usual. We assume we have an "open" predicate phone no (N ame; N umber; T ) 7.2.

Reference-contexts: Before going any further, we will recapitulate at greater length the arguments from Section 1.1, and establish more precisely what we mean by "natural-language interfacing". Normally, the problem is thought of as that of producing answers to natural-language questions posed to a knowledge base <ref> (cf. Perrault and Grosz, 1988) </ref>. Here, we will adopt a more general view; we will regard it as the problem of formalizing the relationship between 1) the contents of a database, and 2) the way in which people use language to talk about it.

Reference-contexts: The rules used to relate QLFs to surface strings are coded entirely in terms of unification, and are both in theory and in practice fully reversible. Generation of surface form from QLF is performed by the Semantic Head-Driven generation algorithm <ref> (Shieber et al 1990) </ref>, and will not be discussed further here; we will instead concentrate on the problem of producing suitable QLF representations from database input, expressed in terms of TRL formulas. We will consider generation of both assertions and questions, as described in Section 2.5.5.

Reference-contexts: The best-known systems to embody variants of this approach are PHLIQA (Bronnenberg et al 1980) and the systems developed at BBN during the mid-80's <ref> (Stallard 1986) </ref> where the method is referred to as `recursive terminological simplification'. In both of these there is restricted inference amounting to a form of type-checking. The advantage of equivalential translation methods in general is that they justify both positive and negative answers.

Reference-contexts: The standard solution to the problem is to include a simplifier, a module which takes the output from a translation stage and attempts to reduce it to a more compact form (cf e.g. <ref> (Williams 1991) </ref>). This section will describe CLARE's simplifier. Although the simplifier's primary use is in conjunction with the translator, it has turned out to provide a functionality that several other parts of the system utilise.
