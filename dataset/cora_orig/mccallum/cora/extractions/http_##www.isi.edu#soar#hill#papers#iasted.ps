Reference-contexts: Introduction The Deep Space Network (DSN) <ref> [1] </ref> was established in 1958 and since then it has evolved into the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications and radio navigation network in the world.

Reference-contexts: Conditional branches in the network are performed only under certain conditions. Optional paths are those which are not essential to the operation, but may, for example, provide a higher level of confidence in the data resulting from a plan if performed. More details about TDNs are provided in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Using this problem specification, the DSN planner then uses task reduction planning techniques (also called hierarchical task network or HTN) <ref> [5] </ref> and operator-based planning techniques [6] to produce a parameterized track-specific TDN to be used to conduct the track. The actual planner used to generate the TDN is a modified version of the task reduction planning component of the Multimission VICAR Planner system [7].

Reference-contexts: The actual planner used to generate the TDN is a modified version of the task reduction planning component of the Multimission VICAR Planner system <ref> [7] </ref>. This trackspecific TDN and the SOE can then be used by LMCOA to operate the actual antenna to conduct the requested antenna track.
