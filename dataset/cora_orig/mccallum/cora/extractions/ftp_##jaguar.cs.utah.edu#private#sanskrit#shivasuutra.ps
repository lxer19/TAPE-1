Title: Consciousness and Freedom according to the

Abstract: The logic of materialist science fails when observers are considered. How can inanimate matter, governed by fixed laws, lead to mind? To bring in consciousness as a separate category like space, time, matter, as suggested by many physicists and neuroscientists, leads to further paradox. This very issue was considered with great subtlety in the Vedic tradition of India. Here we consider one of the late classics of this tradition that deals with the question of consciousness, laws, and freedom|the justly famous Siva Sutras (c. 800 C.E.). We present a new translation of the Siva Sutras along with a commentary.

Reference-contexts: The consciousness aspect of the Vedas was emphasized most emphatically by Dayananda (1824-1883) and Aurobindo (1872-1950). It is seen with directness in the Upanishads. For an overview of the Vedic tradition see the recent book coauthored by me <ref> (Feuerstein et al, 1995) </ref>; this book summarizes new insights from archaeology and history of science. It has been less than a century that the theories of relativity and quantum physics have brought the observer centerstage in physics.

Reference-contexts: But these successes have not brought us any closer to the resolution of the mystery of consciousness. In the application of quantum theory to the macroworld and in the neuropsychological explorations of the brain, one cannot any longer ignore the question of the observer <ref> (e.g. Kak, 1995a, 1995b, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c) </ref>. The notion that the mind emerges somehow out of the complexity of the connections inside the brain is too simplistic to be taken seriously. <p> One is supposed to take oneself as an outsider. By separating the senses from the source of consciousness, one is able to reach to the heart of the self. 1 This is the binding problem of neuroscience to which no solution, within the standard scientific paradigm, is known <ref> (see Kak 1995a for details) </ref>. 3 The Siva Sutras Ths section presents my new English translation. For earlier translations see Jaideva Singh (1979) and Dyczkowski (1992).
