Abstract: We introduce the notion of expansiveness to characterize a family of robot configuration spaces whose connectivity can be effectively captured by a roadmap of randomly-sampled milestones. The analysis of expansive configuration spaces has inspired us to develop a new randomized planning algorithm. This new algorithm tries to sample only the portion of the configuration space that is relevant to the current query, avoiding the cost of precomputing a roadmap for the entire configuration space. Thus, it is well-suited for problems where only a single query is submitted for a given environment. The algorithm has been implemented and successfully applied to complex assembly maintainability problems from the automotive industry.

Reference-contexts: In the n-D version of the example in Figure 5, the maximum clearance of a path going through the narrow passage is always w=2, for any integer k 2 <ref> [1; n 1] </ref>. The bound in Theorem 2 is always exponential in n, even if the passage is wide in most dimensions. Our new bound based on expansiveness yields a number of milestones that is only exponential in k.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the previous result in Ref. <ref> [10] </ref> there is no need for a complete planner here. Although roadmap planners offer an efficient solution for multiple-query path planning problems, they are not suitable when only a single query is submitted for a given environment. <p> For brevity we will abbreviate the term "(*; ff; fi)-expansive" by "expansive". The first condition in Definition 2 guarantees every point in F sees at least an * fraction of the free space, a property of F that we called *-goodness in Ref. <ref> [10] </ref>. In the example of Figure 2, * 0:5. The second condition guarantees that every subset S F 0 has a relatively large lookout set. Think of S as the union of the visibility sets of a set M of points. <p> Theorem 1 established below states that with high probability no two connected components of R lie in the same connected component of F. Combined with the earlier result in Ref. <ref> [10] </ref>, Theorem 1 implies that with high probability, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the connected components of R and those of F . 5 Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: Once a path has been efficiently computed in the transformed space, an inverse transformation could be used to map the path into the original free space. We also plan to integrate the new planner with the roadmap planner in Ref. <ref> [11] </ref> for multiple-query path planning problems. Currently the roadmap planner samples the configuration uniformly at random from the configuration space in order to generate milestones.
