Title: Investigating Strong Collaboration with the Annotated Egret Navigator  
Author: Philip M. Johnson and Carleton Moore 
Address: Honolulu, Hawaii 96822  
Affiliation: Department of Information and Computer Sciences University of Hawaii  
Abstract: The Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN) is a system designed to support strong collaboration among a group as they cooperatively build, review, revise, and improve a structured hypertext document. AEN was used as the central instructional and research system for a graduate seminar on collaborative systems at the University of Hawaii during Fall, 1994. AEN was used for over 285 hours during the second half of the semester alone, and users generated over 800 nodes and 800 links. Lessons learned about strong collaboration include: (1) Users as well as artifacts should be visible; (2) Provide direct and indirect authoring mechanisms; (3) Provide context-sensitive change information; (4) Provide access to intermediate work products; (5) Maintain database integrity; (6) An agent-based architecture may be necessary for systems supporting strong collaboration; and (7) The WWW is not effective for strong collaboration.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Hypertext has become a preferred medium for electronic presentation of textual information. Virtually all on-line documentation for commercial PC and mainframe applications appears in hypertext format, and the exploding popularity of the World Wide Web <ref> [1] </ref> and its HTML protocol virtually guarantees that the information superhighway will be hypertextual. Typically, hypertext document development and use is only weakly collaborative in nature. The usual paradigm involves a single person constructing a hypertext document to be browsed at some future point by others. <p> The original statements are not edited to reflect the new consensus. In AEN, users edit the original document or arguments as part of building consensus. Unlike AEN, CLARE does not provide synchronous communication between the participants and there is no representation of user presence in the hypertext document. WWW <ref> [1] </ref> is designed for global, Internet-based storage and dissemination of hypertext documents, multi-media data. The WWW provides crude, password-based access control, no locking or other form of concurrency control, and virtually no representation of user state.

Reference-contexts: AEN is not designed to have a strong process model since we do not wish to constrain any potential styles of collaborative authoring and learning. gIBIS <ref> [2] </ref> is a design rationale capturing system. The process of collecting and storing design rationale is essentially additive in nature. New issues, positions and arguments are added to the existing database to keep track of the design process.

Reference-contexts: To support coordination in a distributed classroom environment, AEN also provides real-time (textual) communication facilities. Our experiences with AEN lead us to believe that such facilities are essential for computer-mediated strong collaboration. AEN is similar to several other collaborative systems. SEPIA <ref> [3] </ref>, a hypertext authoring system that supports collaborative authoring, does not appear to provide restricted read or write access in order to support temporary sub groups like AEN does. SEPIA does have a strong sense of physical presence like AEN.

Reference-contexts: Partyline is similar to an Internet chat mechanism. Typically, users use Partyline messages to greet the other people logged in to AEN. 4 Experiences The initial requirements document for AEN <ref> [4] </ref> was developed in June, 1994, and an alpha Version 1.0 was released for classroom use in September, 1994. By mid-October, we finished a substantial redesign of AEN and released Version 2.2.0.

Reference-contexts: As a class project, one group designed an interface to the WWW from AEN, and a snapshot of the AEN database as it existed in December, 1994, is available for perusal from the AEN Home Page <ref> [7] </ref>. In general, our experience with using AEN as the principal instructional format for a class on collaborative systems was extremely successful.

Reference-contexts: SEPIA does have a strong sense of physical presence like AEN. Each user has a location in the hypertext document visible to the other users. ConversationBuilder <ref> [8] </ref> is a collaborative work tool that supports more than collaborative writing. It also supports a strong, flexible process model of obligations that the users must complete before they can move on to another task in ConversationBuilder.

Reference-contexts: The data stored in gIBIS is used for reference and is not intended to be edited at a later date. Unlike gIBIS, AEN provides explicit facilities, such as unread nodes, access control, and locking to support changes to existing information within the system. CLARE <ref> [9] </ref>, a computer-based collaborative learning environment, has a very strong process and data model used to learn about scientific text. Users of CLARE evolve a group knowledge base based upon comparing and debating their interpretations of a scientific text. These comparisons and debates are additive.
