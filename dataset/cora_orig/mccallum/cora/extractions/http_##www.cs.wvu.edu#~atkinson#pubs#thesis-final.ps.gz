Reference-contexts: The abstract data types came to be regarded as object definitions, and Modula-3 incorporated the notion of object components <ref> [1] </ref>. Meyer [84, 85] argues the case for object-oriented software component descriptions by pointing out that taking a bottom-up compositional view of software construction, working with structured collections of abstract data types, and having language constructs such as multiple inheritance and deferred features all contribute to seamless development 20 2.3.

Reference-contexts: In effect, composition of components can be regarded as composition of their specifications. A number of attempts to formalise the composition operators of specifications have been made. Abadi and Lamport <ref> [2] </ref> develop results for language-independent specification composition. Butler and Duke [17] and Griffiths [49] provide semantics for the operation composition operators of the formal specification language Object-Z [31, 33]. Software generation systems synthesise software systems by composing components from component libraries.

Reference-contexts: The American Library Association defines the task of bibliographic control as <ref> [3, p4] </ref> "the skill or art ... of organizing knowledge (information) for retrieval.". Since the role of software libraries is to communicate information to software engineers, consideration of techniques for organizing, cataloging and classifying traditional library holdings are of relevance when considering software components in a software library.

Reference-contexts: The quality of retrieval schemes used can alleviate both problems, by searching collections and finding components closely resembling the desired component. However, it is still difficult for an automated retrieval scheme to reach that goal <ref> [4, 90] </ref>. Retrieval of components will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Problems 1 and 2 are problems which can be addressed in a relatively direct manner.

Reference-contexts: The ordering is defined so that behaviours having only small differences in the number of responses (determinism) and the position and number of rejected messages (failures) are more closely related than others. The precise definition of the ordering is given in <ref> [5] </ref>. It is modelled here as a (partially ordered) relationship between behaviours called ordering : BhvrOrdering == Behaviour $ Behaviour ; ordering : BhvrOrdering The behavioural ordering is used in conjunction with the behaviour from the query to determine which behaviours are closest to the query's behaviour.

Reference-contexts: The chapter concludes with a summary of the issues raised by the formal model. 8.1 Introduction The process of computer language standardisation aims to promote multi-platform software development. This has usually been achieved through the standardisation of library facilities offered across many platforms <ref> [6] </ref>. The underlying principle of substitutability behind a standard library is that any program which adheres to the standard library facilities can be readily compiled and executed on any platform which supports these facilities.

Reference-contexts: Information Retrieval The information retrieval approach to software libraries is to regard software components as textual documents. This is done in order to take advantage of the work investigating the well-known problem of document retrieval. Bates <ref> [7] </ref> argues that the objective of retrieval systems should not be to strive for near-automation of the search process but rather to allow humans access to some of the hitherto internal strategic search processes used during retrieval. <p> The aim of this would be to apply such operators to the classes presented as close solutions, generating new classes closer to the desired class. There remains a role for human decision making and control during matching and retrieval (as argued for by Bates <ref> [7] </ref>), particularly as to whether the cost of retrieval and adaptation outweighs the cost of development, and as to the application of composition operators to modify components in a desired fashion. 191 7.6.

Reference-contexts: Butler and Duke [17] and Griffiths [49] provide semantics for the operation composition operators of the formal specification language Object-Z [31, 33]. Software generation systems synthesise software systems by composing components from component libraries. Batory and O'Malley [9] developed software system generators, called GenVoca generators.

Reference-contexts: OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS patterns [66], lessening the overheads of communication between software engineers. Additionally, an application domain can be abstracted into a collection of patterns called a framework [65]. The notion of patterns extends across levels of abstraction from coding patterns <ref> [10] </ref> to meta-patterns [100]. Their appearance at many levels of abstraction has fostered investigation of their formal interpretation [71] and use in automatically generating code [16].

Reference-contexts: In the context of software libraries, this becomes especially relevant because the artefacts retrieved are potentially complex interacting software systems, the construction of which demands some measure of control by the library user. Belkin and Croft <ref> [11] </ref> present process models for information retrieval and filtering, concluding that at an abstract level, filtering and retrieval are identifiable tasks. Filtering software components from software libraries using metrics has already been treated as a viable method for retrieval from software libraries [98].

Reference-contexts: Regular attempts to summarise the status of software reuse research have been made. These summaries and some important issues raised in each are mentioned below: * Biggerstaff and Perlis <ref> [13] </ref> collected assorted articles from the literature, and parti tioned reuse approaches into two sub-fields: - Composition-based systems: reuse is enabled via composition of software components. <p> existing approaches to the component retrieval problem into a formally specified object-oriented framework, providing a model enabling comparison and description of integrated retrieval schemes. 6.1 Introduction The problem of retrieval from component libraries has long been considered to be the central technical issue surrounding the task of software library construction <ref> [13, 82] </ref>. However, the recent movement towards organisational and domain-specific software reuse strategies has simplified the retrieval problem by narrowing the scope of the universe of discourse. This has enabled specialist techniques such as domain-modelling [103] and controlled-vocabulary [42] retrieval schemes to be applied with some success.

Reference-contexts: Lins [76] defines a Modula-2 component library based upon data abstraction and notions of software components developed by Booch <ref> [14] </ref>. Uhl and Schmid [121] define a general catalogue of reusable abstract data types (focusing on container classes) using Ada as the component definition language.

Reference-contexts: The retrieval schemes proposed in the literature can be categorised, based upon the technique used to represent components during the search process: Classification-based schemes: Assorted classification and indexing techniques, including keyword comparison, facet [104], frame [22], descriptor [86], lexical affinity [80] and feature-based <ref> [15] </ref> schemes all seek to find relevant components based upon controlled vocabularies, properties and ontologies external to the component. Structural schemes: Type signature [131] and specification matching [40, 62, 106, 132] techniques seek to find relevant components based upon elements of the structure of software components. <p> Faceted retrieval schemes are one of many retrieval schemes using vocabulary based classification of software components. Examples of similar classification schemes include retrieval using the Reboot project's faceted scheme [110], frames [22], features <ref> [15] </ref>, class descriptors [86] and lexical affinity [80]. These retrieval schemes could also be modelled under the common framework presented in this section. 6.2.7 Assembled Formal Declarations This section presents a summary of the general abstract framework for retrieval schemes.

Their appearance at many levels of abstraction has fostered investigation of their formal interpretation [71] and use in automatically generating code <ref> [16] </ref>. London and Milstead [78] present component specifications of two Smalltalk components (realistic sets and dictionaries) in the Z specification language [116] in order to evaluate some of the problems with using formal specification languages to specify components.

RELATED AND FUTURE WORK </title>
Reference-contexts: In effect, composition of components can be regarded as composition of their specifications. A number of attempts to formalise the composition operators of specifications have been made. Abadi and Lamport [2] develop results for language-independent specification composition. Butler and Duke <ref> [17] </ref> and Griffiths [49] provide semantics for the operation composition operators of the formal specification language Object-Z [31, 33]. Software generation systems synthesise software systems by composing components from component libraries. Batory and O'Malley [9] developed software system generators, called GenVoca generators. <p> ConstructedOperation GeneralComponent Label == Identifier left ; right : ComposedOperation components = hleft ; right i references = ? A number of different collaboration styles are defined in Object-Z <ref> [17] </ref>. The Transfer operation currently uses the sequential style of collaboration between operations (denoted by symbol o 9 ), which sequentially composes two operations so that outputs of the first are available as inputs to the second. <p> This extension can be incorporated into the model presented above without compromising the abstract framework of retrieval in Section 6.2. Incorporating Component Composition Hall searched a library of function components, and used functional application of one component on another as the sole composition operator. Butler and Duke <ref> [17] </ref> define several composition operators for object-based systems. We apply their framework to give an extension of the behavioural retrieval scheme above.

Reference-contexts: It has been recognised that replacement d ? should be compatible in some way with removed component c?, to provide guarantees for clients of operation c? who subsequently use d ?. Generally, two forms of guarantees have been investigated: statically checkable guarantees such as signature [131] or type <ref> [18, 97] </ref> compatibility; and dynamic guarantees of behavioural compatibility as mentioned in Section 2.3.2. The operation RemoveOperation has been constructed by identifying all components possibly affected, and propagating change to them in form of operations DetachReference and DetachComponent .

Reference-contexts: These interface issues are important to ensure cooperation of components 29 2.5. SUMMARY when adapted from a retrieved library component. Additionally the library itself will need to evolve over time, and do so in a way which minimally affects client code. Casais <ref> [19] </ref> discusses in detail, and provides algorithms for, small and large scale object-oriented library evolution. <p> The relation is used in the definition of the sample removal policies below. Sample Removal Policy 1: Class Removal Suppose a class component cl is to be removed from a library l . Class removal policies have been implemented and presented in the object-oriented database literature. Casais <ref> [19] </ref> investigated the class removal policies of three object-oriented database systems (Gemstone, ORION and O 2 ).

Reference-contexts: This suggests that ideas from all stages of development comprise knowledge that is reusable. In particular, the reuse of common patterns which appear during software design <ref> [20, 43] </ref> has been an area of intensive research. Design patterns capture architectural and environmental constraints on participating components and connections between the components. Such patterns can be used to replay software developments using a catalogue of standard 24 2.4.

Reference-contexts: Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java [73]), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming [52, 96] all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings. To alleviate these shortcomings, disciplines to direct the use of component description languages (3C model [120], RESOLVE <ref> [21] </ref>, and Design Patterns [44]) have been proposed. These disciplines prescribe recommended styles of expression within some component description language. The choice of any single component description language for software libraries is not clear given the continuing evolution of component description languages.

Reference-contexts: This conversion function remains undefined, as extraction of behavioural responses from static models is the subject of ongoing research. In particular, in the specification-based testing community have defined methods for defining test cases based on semi-automated derivation of state machines <ref> [23] </ref> and test graphs which characterise state machines [56]. In general, we want to show that compatibility of two classes implies substitutability of those classes. This would provide the behavioural guarantee desired.

Reference-contexts: The collection of components (as shown in Figure 4.5) is modelled as a class union of the Object-Z components: Component == System [ Cluster [ Class [ State [ Declaration [ Operation [ Predicate [ Expression [ NullComponent The class union operator, defined in Dong <ref> [24] </ref>, views each Object-Z class as a set of identified objects (i.e. those objects conforming to the class specification). The class union operator, when applied to a pair of classes, forms a set of object identities by 73 4.5. <p> A library will contain a number of components and a number of (possibly integrated) retrieval schemes, of various kinds. The collection of retrieval schemes for a given library can be described using the Object-Z class union construct <ref> [24] </ref>: 162 6.6.

Reference-contexts: The effect of insertion upon the relation is determined implicitly from the definition of the relation without the need for explicit declaration of the effects. The role of derived attributes in formal object modelling was 121 5.8. SUMMARY considered in detail by Dong <ref> [25] </ref>. 5.8.3 Conclusions The operational sufficiency of the data model presented in Chapter 4 has been established, subject to further consideration of the retrieval operation in Chapters 6 and 7. Clearly many other operations and annotations could be defined for a library of components. <p> AN ABSTRACT RETRIEVAL FRAMEWORK The searcher is not modelled in detail within the framework; however, it is convenient to represent the searcher as part of the definition of the search process by inclusion of the secondary attribute <ref> [25] </ref>: searcher : Searcher into the RetrievalSchemeName class, where the type Searcher is assumed to be part of the surrounding environment of the framework. Every search proceeds with the searcher issuing a query and the retrieval scheme performing the search. <p> Because this information depends on and can be derived from the kernel environment using component relationships, these two collections are modelled as secondary attributes <ref> [25] </ref>. In the next section it is shown that feature declarations record which class declaration they originated from (i.e. the class declaration in which they are immediately defined).

Reference-contexts: The implicit attribute self holds the identity of the current object, and the implicit containment attribute contain represents the closure of the containment relation, which in this case denotes the set of all subcomponents. The concept of containment for Object-Z class declarations is defined by Dong <ref> [26] </ref>. While it is the static form of components that is of immediate concern, some dynamic aspects of the core schema are included here for future use. Some operations are made available to affect component enclosure.

Reference-contexts: The use of invariants in Object-Z to enforce integrity constraints has also been exploited in other works. Invariant conditions were used to capture database constraints in Leadbetter [72] and to capture static semantic constraints of programming languages in Dong <ref> [27] </ref>. The use of derived variables to capture and describe annotations has also been presented. The advantage gained is the automatic re-calculation of derived variables when the library is modified. For example, insertion of an operation into a class component may change the outgoing reference relation of the class.

Reference-contexts: The problem exists where a number of separate libraries which each contain similar software artefacts are organised using different abstractions. This problem was subsequently highlighted by Duke <ref> [28] </ref> who argues that such differences 15 2.2.

Reference-contexts: In general, there may be many relationships between two software components, any of which may be used as the basis for browsing and retrieval from a software library. One component may be a subtype [77] of another, be behaviourally compatible [114] with another, or be substitutable <ref> [29] </ref> with another. These notions all differ slightly in their definition. The subtype relationship in Liskov and Wing [77] (the Liskov Substitutability Principle) is concerned with being able to operate a component of a subtype as a component of its supertype. <p> The behavioural compatibility relationships as defined in Smith [114] use a formal model of object behaviour to define 22 2.3. DATA REQUIREMENTS operational and observational notions of compatibility for passive and active objects respectively. The substitutability relationships between objects defined in Duke <ref> [29] </ref> model objects as state transition systems and use a lattice over such systems to determine object compatibility. It is important to consider all such relationships, because the organisation of a software library can benefit from and may reflect the knowledge embodied in many component relationships.

Reference-contexts: Following this idea, users may specify desired behaviour with a formal specification, from which behaviour can be inferred <ref> [30, 114] </ref>. The aim is to enable the methodology to be applied to a library of classes described by formal specifications.

Software generation systems synthesise software systems by composing components from component libraries. Batory and O'Malley [9] developed software system generators, called GenVoca generators. Batory and Geraci [8] discuss the problem of validating the generated compositions, to ensure their semantic correctness. <p> MODELLING EIFFEL DECLARATIONS The next sections present a model of the ELS standard in the formal specification language Object-Z [31], which has been advocated for the specification of standards <ref> [33] </ref>. The focus of the model will be on specifying the library compatibility rules; hence the specific detail about the features each class offers will not be discussed.

Reference-contexts: To view software libraries as information systems necessitates consideration of transactions on software libraries. As for any information system, the major concerns are the detection, assessment and repair of integrity constraint violations to avoid update anomalies. Elmasri and Navathe <ref> [38] </ref> claim "no data model is capable of representing all types of constraints that may occur" within a universe of discourse.

Reference-contexts: Many programmers maintain a personal library of code which may be reused in later projects. However, existing software libraries vary in scale from such personally maintained collections of code, through comprehensive domain-specific collections, to a number of very large domain-spanning libraries <ref> [39, 115] </ref>. There are several existing software library systems used in this chapter to highlight the cognitive design deficiencies. They are based on the languages Eiffel [86], C++[117], Smalltalk [47], and Java [73].

All the above libraries address Problem 2 by offering name-based search facilities which provide rudimentary querying capabilities.

The sizes of the libraries under consideration are not so large as to render browsing infeasible.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that ideas from all stages of development comprise knowledge that is reusable. In particular, the reuse of common patterns which appear during software design <ref> [20, 43] </ref> has been an area of intensive research. Design patterns capture architectural and environmental constraints on participating components and connections between the components. Such patterns can be used to replay software developments using a catalogue of standard 24 2.4. <p> These applications serve as vehicles for idiomatic familiarisation, and often expose the library user to ways of constructing useful collaborations in ways intended by the library developer. Often 44 3.2. COMPONENT REPRESENTATION such collaborative frameworks are also documented in reference material provided with the software library. Design patterns <ref> [43] </ref> can be viewed as generic extractions of common, useful collaborative structures of components. If such additional structure is provided with libraries, clearly "comment and type signature" interfaces alone are not adequate for effective use of a library.

Reference-contexts: Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java [73]), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming [52, 96] all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings. To alleviate these shortcomings, disciplines to direct the use of component description languages (3C model [120], RESOLVE [21], and Design Patterns <ref> [44] </ref>) have been proposed. These disciplines prescribe recommended styles of expression within some component description language. The choice of any single component description language for software libraries is not clear given the continuing evolution of component description languages. However, this should not preclude a choice being made and investigated. <p> The storage of design patterns in a software library will therefore be beneficial to software engineers, by providing components which have been found to be practically useful. In general, a design pattern has four essential elements <ref> [44] </ref>: a pattern name, a problem 239 9.3.

Typically, the pattern problem is informally explained using natural language.

Reference-contexts: This section provides a short overview of the software library retrieval problem and the main approaches taken in the literature so far.

Reference-contexts: There are several existing software library systems used in this chapter to highlight the cognitive design deficiencies. They are based on the languages Eiffel [86], C++[117], Smalltalk <ref> [47] </ref>, and Java [73]. The existing libraries which have been chosen for this review are medium-scale, object-oriented and domain-specific, thereby avoiding obscuring the deficiencies through large size or wide coverage. In particular, we will be reviewing libraries covering the domains of data structures and user interface construction. <p> The Eiffel Base library presents a list of standard categories [87, p104] into which all operations in the library are classified. For example, "access" operations are used to obtain elements from a structure, and "measurement" operations are queries pertaining to the size of a structure. The Smalltalk library <ref> [47] </ref> also utilises categories into which methods and classes are classified. Without loss of generality, suppose the categories to be used in the classification regime for Object-Z operation components are given as the type: [Category ] 111 5.6.

Reference-contexts: The following dichotomies are identified: white vs. black box reuse, planned vs. ad-hoc reuse, vertical vs. horizontal reuse and compositional vs. generative reuse. The conclusion is that the current trends towards domain analysis [103] and development of reuse process models to integrate reuse into standard lifecycles <ref> [48] </ref> may help solve the reuse problem. * Mili et. al.[90] provides a discussion on issues and research directions which touches upon costing and measuring reuse, reuse-oriented software engineering process models, developing reusable assets, and developing with reusable assets (dealing with retrieval, composition, and adaptation of components). 1.2 The Role of

Reference-contexts: In effect, composition of components can be regarded as composition of their specifications. A number of attempts to formalise the composition operators of specifications have been made. Abadi and Lamport [2] develop results for language-independent specification composition. Butler and Duke [17] and Griffiths <ref> [49] </ref> provide semantics for the operation composition operators of the formal specification language Object-Z [31, 33]. Software generation systems synthesise software systems by composing components from component libraries. Batory and O'Malley [9] developed software system generators, called GenVoca generators. <p> Weide and Hollingsworth [127] argue that insertion of a component should ensure its local certifiability. Griffiths <ref> [49] </ref> formally distinguishes between strictly modular properties of a component and properties which must be ensured within the context of a particular system. In general, the process of insertion of a component should consider: 28 2.4.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental difficulty when considering this problem is how to decompose the requirements in such a way as to yield known component specifications. It is not always the case that such a decomposition is possible. 23 2.3. DATA REQUIREMENTS Hall <ref> [50] </ref> reverses the problem by attempting to search the space of all possible component compositions until one satisfying the requirements is found. <p> An external-static hybrid approach has been proposed in [36]. Behavioural schemes: Behavioural techniques seek to take advantage of the distinguishing property of software | executability. Behaviour-based techniques <ref> [50, 89, 26 2.4. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 99] </ref> seek to find relevant components by comparing input and output spaces of components. A formal theory for behavioural retrieval schemes is presented in Chapter 7. <p> In that case, the retrieval scheme could not have found a component with a behaviour closer to that desired. A different style of behaviour-based retrieval has been proposed by Hall <ref> [50] </ref>. The major difference is that the behaviours of functional compositions of components are also 156 6.5. BEHAVIOURAL RETRIEVAL searched, allowing small programs consisting of composed components to be selected. <p> However, it is the dynamic behaviour of objects that is of the most concern when building applications <ref> [50, 99] </ref>. It is this behavioural view of retrieval that is discussed. In Section 7.2 a class is modelled in terms of the way objects of that class respond to sequences of messages. In Section 7.3 a partial order is constructed to compare the behaviour of different classes. <p> Secondly, a notion of failure was included in the behavioural model, and the idea that failures can be removed was incorporated into the underlying partial order between behaviours. Thirdly, a prescription for behavioural retrieval involving the join and meet lattice operations was given. 7.6.2 Implementation Concerns Hall <ref> [50] </ref> presents and discusses implementation issues of a library of functions; these were presented in Section 6.5.5. There are number of practical considerations when considering the implementation of the object-based methodology of this chapter.

Reference-contexts: There are no guarantees that useful results will be found. The results may be too specific or general, unfit for the searcher's intended purpose or irrelevant entirely. Subjectivity <ref> [51] </ref> and the resulting abstraction and vocabulary mismatches further reduce the likelihood of finding useful components. Even when relevant components are found, it is often not clear what their expected uses are. This lack of documentation can leave software engineers prone to contextual mis-use of the component.

Reference-contexts: It is also claimed that the principles of information hiding and encapsulation need re-investigation to allow open implementations [69]. The choice of any object-oriented component description language for libraries may still be premature. Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java [73]), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming <ref> [52, 96] </ref> all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings. To alleviate these shortcomings, disciplines to direct the use of component description languages (3C model [120], RESOLVE [21], and Design Patterns [44]) have been proposed. These disciplines prescribe recommended styles of expression within some component description language.

In particular, we discuss the insertion of an operation into an existing class component. Insertion at other levels of granularity share similar concerns. Three sample 98 5.3.

Reference-contexts: This conversion function remains undefined, as extraction of behavioural responses from static models is the subject of ongoing research. In particular, in the specification-based testing community have defined methods for defining test cases based on semi-automated derivation of state machines [23] and test graphs which characterise state machines <ref> [56] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the models constructed in this thesis are largely based on the assumption that a software library is viewed as an information system. As a standard model for the construction of distributed information systems, the Open Distributed Processing (ODP) document <ref> [58] </ref> represents a framework within which the models of a software library can be placed. The models presented in this thesis can be extended to cover more of the information and enterprise viewpoints of the ODP document. 242

Reference-contexts: From the perspective that a software library is an information system, such a model forms the invariant and static schemas (following standard information systems terminology <ref> [59] </ref>) for the software library. The models defined in this chapter will be referred to generically as "static", encompassing both invariant and static schemata of the software library. A number of requirements for this data model have already been established in previous chapters. <p> These constraints form the basis for insertion and removal techniques and policies. 5.2 Integrity Constraints Integrity constraints specify rules about a universe of discourse. Applied to information systems, integrity constraints govern valid database states and valid database transactions, and are generally expressible as invariant schematic constraints <ref> [59] </ref>. In this section various kinds of integrity constraints and their application to software information systems are identified. To view software libraries as information systems necessitates consideration of transactions on software libraries.

Reference-contexts: This means that in order for an operation on a component to be successful, both "views" of a component must be maintained so as to satisfy the invariant relating them. Methods for such specification of separate viewpoints and their subsequent merging have been proposed for the Z specification language <ref> [60] </ref> and for object-oriented hierarchies [95]. Adoption of viewpoint specification techniques may simplify the library development and component annotation processes. In Chapter 8, one policy for library evolution that guaranteed protection of client be-haviour in the presence of library update was examined.

Such a series of actions, called a recipe (sometimes called a scenario or a use-case <ref> [61] </ref>), denotes the intended or conventional use of a component. Furthermore, one or more recipes may be associated with each component, since the manuals for many microwaves and VCRs often include a collection of recipes for different tasks, each recipe being documented as a series of button presses.

Reference-contexts: The clustering of the libraries mentioned above is presumably undertaken by library designers. However, there have been attempts at automatically clustering component descriptions using lexical metrics derived from code comments [80], and using analysis of ranked order-sorted specification formulae <ref> [63] </ref>. There is no single way of clustering components which is universally useful. Many different criteria could be used in different circumstances (for example, alphabetical by class name or using the inheritance relationship). The criteria chosen depends on the needs of the library searcher.

Reference-contexts: To refactor a system means to change its internal structure without changing its externally visible behaviour. A simple refactoring is to move an object attribute from a subclass to a superclass. Retrieved systems may have to be adapted via refactoring to ensure efficiency or readability. Jeng and Cheng <ref> [64] </ref> show how using order-sorted unification of specifications can yield a set of substitutions guiding the adaptation of retrieved components.

Reference-contexts: Of course, it is desirable that components in the library are well-formed and well-typed. However, the constraints expressed throughout this section are not sufficient for ensuring meaningful Object-Z declarations. Detailed structural and type constraints for Object-Z have been implemented in a type-checking tool developed at the University of Queensland <ref> [67] </ref>. 4.5.2 Cluster Components A cluster refers to a collection of components which are grouped according to some criteria. The third cognitive deficiency of existing libraries, stated in Section 3.3.1, was in part to impede access to components through subjective clustering of components. <p> Foremost, the specification and development procedures should be pragmatically applied to construct a software library implementation. Work in this area has started, with the development of a parser, type checker and browser for Object-Z specifications called 240 9.3. RELATED AND FUTURE WORK Wizard <ref> [67] </ref>. However, Wizard was developed in the absence of the general component model, rendering incorporation of that model difficult. Moreover, the approach taken in this thesis was to specify a software library before undertaking an implementation.

Reference-contexts: The notions of quality for functional descriptions of the real world and means for evaluating them are the subject of continuing research into software engineering notations (e.g. UML [105] (object-oriented notation), VDM <ref> [68] </ref> (formal notation), CSP [55] (concurrency notation)). 5.3.2 Inserting Object-Z Components In this section, the insertion of components into a library of Object-Z components is considered. In particular, we discuss the insertion of an operation into an existing class component. Insertion at other levels of granularity share similar concerns. <p> Integrity constraints for specification languages are motivated by the quality of the semantics of submitted components. More sophisticated means to assess the semantics 100 5.3. COMPONENT INSERTION of specification components may include checks to detect whether a submitted component is fully-abstract <ref> [68] </ref>, and not implementation or performance biased [112]. However, automated means for such detection and provision of appropriate feedback are not yet existent. Acceptance The operation to insert an accepted operation component into a class can be modelled by augmenting the Class component definition in Section 4.5.3. <p> Some implementations of specification matching schemes appear in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Weide and Hollingsworth [127] argue that properties of components should be locally certifiable to allow their reuse in larger systems. It is claimed that no language paradigm enforces this notion. It is also claimed that the principles of information hiding and encapsulation need re-investigation to allow open implementations <ref> [69] </ref>. The choice of any object-oriented component description language for libraries may still be premature. Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java [73]), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming [52, 96] all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings.

The notion of patterns extends across levels of abstraction from coding patterns [10] to meta-patterns [100]. Their appearance at many levels of abstraction has fostered investigation of their formal interpretation <ref> [71] </ref> and use in automatically generating code [16].

Reference-contexts: The use of invariants in Object-Z to enforce integrity constraints has also been exploited in other works. Invariant conditions were used to capture database constraints in Leadbetter <ref> [72] </ref> and to capture static semantic constraints of programming languages in Dong [27]. The use of derived variables to capture and describe annotations has also been presented. The advantage gained is the automatic re-calculation of derived variables when the library is modified.

Reference-contexts: It is also claimed that the principles of information hiding and encapsulation need re-investigation to allow open implementations [69]. The choice of any object-oriented component description language for libraries may still be premature. Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java <ref> [73] </ref>), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming [52, 96] all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings. To alleviate these shortcomings, disciplines to direct the use of component description languages (3C model [120], RESOLVE [21], and Design Patterns [44]) have been proposed. <p> There are several existing software library systems used in this chapter to highlight the cognitive design deficiencies. They are based on the languages Eiffel [86], C++[117], Smalltalk [47], and Java <ref> [73] </ref>. The existing libraries which have been chosen for this review are medium-scale, object-oriented and domain-specific, thereby avoiding obscuring the deficiencies through large size or wide coverage. In particular, we will be reviewing libraries covering the domains of data structures and user interface construction.

Reference-contexts: As with natural languages, it is possible to design a well-formed and well-typed component which lacks a sense of style. The codifying of preferred style as direct constraints on the data model has been considered in the literature. For example, Lieberherr and Holland <ref> [74] </ref> present style guidelines for minimising (or in strict form banning) the dependency of an operation O upon classes which are not the type of operation parameters and not the type of state variables of the class enclosing O .

Reference-contexts: These results apply equally to the model of Object-Z specifications developed in Section 4.5; future work involves application of configuration management activities to the general component model. Lindsay and Traynor <ref> [75] </ref> present a generic model of consistency and change management for systems where configuration items comprise further configuration items which are themselves subject to another regime of configuration management. This scenario is analogous to an evolving software library system that contains components which are independently versioned.

Reference-contexts: Library Tools : Tools for retrieval of existing classes and integration of new classes into the library should be available. 2.2.4 Library Design Principles A number of attempts have been made to specify software library design principles by creating component libraries using three languages: Modula-2, Ada and Eiffel. Lins <ref> [76] </ref> defines a Modula-2 component library based upon data abstraction and notions of software components developed by Booch [14].

Reference-contexts: In general, there may be many relationships between two software components, any of which may be used as the basis for browsing and retrieval from a software library. One component may be a subtype <ref> [77] </ref> of another, be behaviourally compatible [114] with another, or be substitutable [29] with another. These notions all differ slightly in their definition.

Reference-contexts: A problem they identified was that it was not clear whether one should specify in a library the abstract properties of the components or specify their implementations. Clearly delineating the level of abstraction of a specification is important for determining its use in a library. Lortz and Shin <ref> [79] </ref> implement a dynamic object requestor using contracts. As part of their presentation they describe a process of using abstract meta-classes in a library with implementation variants as subclasses.

Reference-contexts: The retrieval schemes proposed in the literature can be categorised, based upon the technique used to represent components during the search process: Classification-based schemes: Assorted classification and indexing techniques, including keyword comparison, facet [104], frame [22], descriptor [86], lexical affinity <ref> [80] </ref> and feature-based [15] schemes all seek to find relevant components based upon controlled vocabularies, properties and ontologies external to the component. Structural schemes: Type signature [131] and specification matching [40, 62, 106, 132] techniques seek to find relevant components based upon elements of the structure of software components. <p> The clustering of the libraries mentioned above is presumably undertaken by library designers. However, there have been attempts at automatically clustering component descriptions using lexical metrics derived from code comments <ref> [80] </ref>, and using analysis of ranked order-sorted specification formulae [63]. There is no single way of clustering components which is universally useful. Many different criteria could be used in different circumstances (for example, alphabetical by class name or using the inheritance relationship). <p> Faceted retrieval schemes are one of many retrieval schemes using vocabulary based classification of software components. Examples of similar classification schemes include retrieval using the Reboot project's faceted scheme [110], frames [22], features [15], class descriptors [86] and lexical affinity <ref> [80] </ref>. These retrieval schemes could also be modelled under the common framework presented in this section. 6.2.7 Assembled Formal Declarations This section presents a summary of the general abstract framework for retrieval schemes.

Reference-contexts: The idea is that software development is abstracted into a set of parameterised rules; when the actual parameters are input, a generated system is output. * McGregor and Sykes <ref> [81] </ref> emphasise the use of class libraries as a major step towards solving the problems of reuse. However they also highlight through their choice of examples one of the major problems with class libraries | different libraries covering the same domain are organised differently. 2 1.2. <p> The final management task discussed is that of supporting the evolution of classes in the library. Class evolution describes the process of re-developing and amending classes to fix some perceived deficiencies.

The problem exists where a number of separate libraries which each contain similar software artefacts are organised using different abstractions.

Reference-contexts: Resistance to such change is pragmatically a real impediment to the introduction of reuse solutions. As a research field, software reuse has been steadily growing since the mid-eighties. Wegner [123] repeated and extended the idea of the manufacture of software components expressed by McIlroy <ref> [82] </ref>. If software is to be treated as a capital investment, then techniques are required to ensure its quality and reusability, thus ensuring that the initial development cost is amortised over the many uses of the software. Regular attempts to summarise the status of software reuse research have been made. <p> Useful software libraries should record ideas and outcomes generated during software developments in such a way as to enable other software engineers to understand them. In turn this can significantly ease the process of software engineering, by providing a source of verified software artefacts <ref> [82, 123] </ref>. The problems associated with communication of information have been examined by Norman [92] who shows how the field of cognitive psychology has progressed by using the idea of people having mental models of the artefacts with which they interact. <p> existing approaches to the component retrieval problem into a formally specified object-oriented framework, providing a model enabling comparison and description of integrated retrieval schemes. 6.1 Introduction The problem of retrieval from component libraries has long been considered to be the central technical issue surrounding the task of software library construction <ref> [13, 82] </ref>. However, the recent movement towards organisational and domain-specific software reuse strategies has simplified the retrieval problem by narrowing the scope of the universe of discourse. This has enabled specialist techniques such as domain-modelling [103] and controlled-vocabulary [42] retrieval schemes to be applied with some success.

It is suggested that solutions to the technical problems of software reuse are of primary concern <ref> [84] </ref>. Nevertheless, adoption of a reuse culture requires organisational change. Resistance to such change is pragmatically a real impediment to the introduction of reuse solutions.

Retrieval schemes are developed by following the template of class RetrievalSchemeName 139 6.2. <p> the reference "Eiffel: The Language"<ref> [86] </ref> and the Eiffel Library Standard [88]. It should be noted that a number of Eiffel declaration components mentioned in this section will be left undefined because their definitions can be considered auxiliary to the theme of the chapter; they are described in Appendix H of [86]. These are the components Message (all possible messages displayed to an Eiffel user), IndexDecl (all possible descriptions used to index a class), GenFormalDecl (all possible generic formal parameter declarations), Comment (all possible class and feature comments) and Boolean expression (all possible boolean expressions). <p> A flatshort declaration is defined as the text that results from computing the flatshort form (see p106 of <ref> [86] </ref>) of a class. Class and flatshort declarations have certain properties in common, such as indexing clauses, whether a class is deferred or expanded, and their name. <p> Also note that the type relation conform used below refers to type conformance between Eiffel classes. In general, the type-conformance relation requires a complex definition (see page 219 of <ref> [86] </ref>). For the purposes of this chapter, it is assumed that a class B conforms to a class A if B inherits A. <p> THE RULES FOR KERNEL COMPATIBILITY 218 8.4. THE RULES FOR KERNEL COMPATIBILITY * i 2 (b) is not a valid call, because B does not conform to C . This violates the signature conformance validity constraint (labelled VNCS on p219 of <ref> [86] </ref>) even though Rule 2.4.1.8 says the difference between the argument types is permitted. Here we have a case of a program written with respect to the standard declarations which behaves differently in distinct certified library implementations, due to the existence of rule 2.4.1.8.

Operations with similar behavioural effects are named similarly. Each of the libraries above make some attempt to have uniform interfaces; in particular the Eiffel libraries <ref> [87] </ref> have undergone extensive renamings with this goal in mind. * Functional completeness: a component is said to be functionally complete if all operations that could be useful for a user of a component are available in that component. <p> Development of criteria for assessing the quality of component interfaces is an area of continuing research. Two criteria, the observability and controllability proferred by operations with respect to the state of the component are discussed in [126].

A discipline for achieving this end (expressed by Meyer <ref> [87] </ref> for the Eiffel libraries) extols the virtue of only using true operands as operation parameters, rather than including additional options as parameters. This can be regarded as a design principle. 91 5.2. INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS Consider an operation named Draw to specify drawing a rectangle to a display. <p> To annotate those operation components enclosed by other operation components (as a result of constructed or distributed operations) serves no purpose because such operations cannot be used outside the context of an enclosing operation.

For example, "access" operations are used to obtain elements from a structure, and "measurement" operations are queries pertaining to the size of a structure.

Reference-contexts: Clearly no single library's regime of classification and clustering can be agreeable to all under all circumstances. In this case, the focus should be on flexibility, consistency and intuitiveness within (rather than between) libraries. A standard developed for the Eiffel kernel library, called the Eiffel Library Standard <ref> [88] </ref>, is formally examined in Chapter 8. The formal rules that comprise the standard can verifiably help alleviate the effects of abstraction mismatch across Eiffel libraries from different vendors. The rules allow a software engineer to directly reuse and rely upon common knowledge as defined in the standard. 51 3.4. <p> Firstly, we formally model the rules for library compatibility proposed in the Eiffel Library Standard <ref> [88] </ref>. The formal modelling process identifies a number of simplifications, ambiguities and a serious deficiency in the definition of the standard. <p> The Eiffel declarations will be modelled using the GeneralComponent model of the core library schema, as defined in Section 4.4. The Eiffel declarations are based upon the definitions provided in the reference "Eiffel: The Language"[86] and the Eiffel Library Standard <ref> [88] </ref>. It should be noted that a number of Eiffel declaration components mentioned in this section will be left undefined because their definitions can be considered auxiliary to the theme of the chapter; they are described in Appendix H of [86]. <p> These cross references are used in the description of the components, and also serve as a mechanism for traceability of the formal to the informal conditions of the ELS document. 196 8.2.

Reference-contexts: The quality of retrieval schemes used can alleviate both problems, by searching collections and finding components closely resembling the desired component. However, it is still difficult for an automated retrieval scheme to reach that goal <ref> [4, 90] </ref>. Retrieval of components will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Problems 1 and 2 are problems which can be addressed in a relatively direct manner.

The problems associated with communication of information have been examined by Norman <ref> [92] </ref> who shows how the field of cognitive psychology has progressed by using the idea of people having mental models of the artefacts with which they interact.

Reference-contexts: Class removal policies have been implemented and presented in the object-oriented database literature. Casais [19] investigated the class removal policies of three object-oriented database systems (Gemstone, ORION and O 2 ). Suppose we adopt the class removal policy of the O 2 database system <ref> [93] </ref>, which forbids class removal when it would result in dangling references in other definitions or when the removal leaves the inheritance graph disconnected.

Reference-contexts: Techniques and policies for insertion and removal are discussed in Chapter 5. 2.4.3 Adaptation and Evolution The adaptation operation modifies a component in order to either allow it to successfully cooperate with other components or to change its internal behaviour. Opdyke <ref> [94] </ref> introduces the concept of refactoring object-oriented systems. To refactor a system means to change its internal structure without changing its externally visible behaviour. A simple refactoring is to move an object attribute from a subclass to a superclass. <p> In Chapter 8, one policy for library evolution that guaranteed protection of client be-haviour in the presence of library update was examined. Other strategies for incremental modification to libraries that protect client behaviour (for example re-structuring <ref> [94] </ref>) have been proposed. Investigation of incremental library update policies with different kinds of guarantee for client programs is warranted. Finally, the models constructed in this thesis are largely based on the assumption that a software library is viewed as an information system.

Reference-contexts: It is also claimed that the principles of information hiding and encapsulation need re-investigation to allow open implementations [69]. The choice of any object-oriented component description language for libraries may still be premature. Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java [73]), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming <ref> [52, 96] </ref> all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings. To alleviate these shortcomings, disciplines to direct the use of component description languages (3C model [120], RESOLVE [21], and Design Patterns [44]) have been proposed. These disciplines prescribe recommended styles of expression within some component description language.

Reference-contexts: It has been recognised that replacement d ? should be compatible in some way with removed component c?, to provide guarantees for clients of operation c? who subsequently use d ?. Generally, two forms of guarantees have been investigated: statically checkable guarantees such as signature [131] or type <ref> [18, 97] </ref> compatibility; and dynamic guarantees of behavioural compatibility as mentioned in Section 2.3.2. The operation RemoveOperation has been constructed by identifying all components possibly affected, and propagating change to them in form of operations DetachReference and DetachComponent .

Reference-contexts: Belkin and Croft [11] present process models for information retrieval and filtering, concluding that at an abstract level, filtering and retrieval are identifiable tasks. Filtering software components from software libraries using metrics has already been treated as a viable method for retrieval from software libraries <ref> [98] </ref>. Fischer et. al.[41] developed prototype tools called CodeFinder and Explainer. Using these tools they examined the requirements of software libraries using information retrieval analysis techniques. <p> Many other search and retrieval strategies have been proposed [40, 104, 132]. Manual browsing of libraries is also a strategy addressing Problem 2. The sizes of the libraries under consideration are not so large as to render browsing infeasible. Pintado <ref> [98] </ref> suggests another strategy for large libraries, called "affinity browsing". Under this scheme, metrics and information derived from components are used to cluster components for browsing purposes. The libraries above address Problem 1 by segregating collections of components, using techniques of sub-libraries, categories or grouped hierarchies. <p> Until recently, most effort in solving the retrieval problem has gone into software classification, with emphasis upon domain-specific aspects such as the signature and specifications of operations [131, 132], and the determination of static metrics that can be used when searching and retrieving <ref> [98, 103] </ref>. However, it is the dynamic behaviour of objects that is of the most concern when building applications [50, 99]. It is this behavioural view of retrieval that is discussed.

Reference-contexts: A more complete investigation of an object-based behavioural retrieval technique appears in Chapter 7; this section serves to introduce the basic elements of behavioural techniques in general. 6.5.1 Scheme Name and Vocabulary The behavioural retrieval scheme described here is based upon the ideas proposed by Podgurski and Peirce <ref> [99] </ref>. Behaviour-based retrieval schemes are inspired by the notion of exploiting the executability of software components to classify them. Sending a program to a component yields dynamic responses which are collected. This collection is called the behaviour of the component. <p> In Chapter 7, the ordering forms a lattice, and lattice operations are used to achieve selection. The selection scheme of <ref> [99] </ref> was based on variance between actual and expected outputs. <p> However, it is the dynamic behaviour of objects that is of the most concern when building applications <ref> [50, 99] </ref>. It is this behavioural view of retrieval that is discussed. In Section 7.2 a class is modelled in terms of the way objects of that class respond to sequences of messages. In Section 7.3 a partial order is constructed to compare the behaviour of different classes. <p> retrieval. 7.6 Discussion and Summary It should be emphasised that this chapter concentrates on the specification of a theoretical framework for behavioural retrieval, rather than giving optimised algorithms for a practical implementation. 7.6.1 Related Work The principle of behavioural retrieval from software libraries has been suggested by Podgurski and Pierce <ref> [99] </ref>. Their "behavioural sampling" technique did not necessarily collect all the possible execution responses but rather "sampled" the responses over a number of executions, and exercised the most commonly used operations based on a probability distribution.

Reference-contexts: OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS patterns [66], lessening the overheads of communication between software engineers. Additionally, an application domain can be abstracted into a collection of patterns called a framework [65]. The notion of patterns extends across levels of abstraction from coding patterns [10] to meta-patterns <ref> [100] </ref>. Their appearance at many levels of abstraction has fostered investigation of their formal interpretation [71] and use in automatically generating code [16]. <p> In effect, Extract and Retrieve are template operations in the framework, while Select is a hook operation in the framework (following the terminology of Pree <ref> [100] </ref>). There are many selection mechanisms for faceted classification schemes, many of which are metrics based on weights of facets and thesaurus relationships. Specified here is the simplest form of faceted-classification matching.

Reference-contexts: Such a facet may be named Object and a word (term) in its term space may be Stack . All components that could be used to affect a Stack in some way would have the term Stack in their Object facet. Prieto-Diaz <ref> [101] </ref> implements a classification system based on a faceted classification of software. Six facets for describing software components were chosen; three describe component functionality and three describe component environment. They are Function, Object , Medium, System-Type, Functional Area and Setting.

Reference-contexts: However they also highlight through their choice of examples one of the major problems with class libraries | different libraries covering the same domain are organised differently. 2 1.2. THE ROLE OF SOFTWARE LIBRARIES * Prieto-Diaz <ref> [102] </ref> provides a list of different aspects of software reuse. The following dichotomies are identified: white vs. black box reuse, planned vs. ad-hoc reuse, vertical vs. horizontal reuse and compositional vs. generative reuse.

Reference-contexts: The following dichotomies are identified: white vs. black box reuse, planned vs. ad-hoc reuse, vertical vs. horizontal reuse and compositional vs. generative reuse. The conclusion is that the current trends towards domain analysis <ref> [103] </ref> and development of reuse process models to integrate reuse into standard lifecycles [48] may help solve the reuse problem. * Mili et. al.[90] provides a discussion on issues and research directions which touches upon costing and measuring reuse, reuse-oriented software engineering process models, developing reusable assets, and developing with reusable <p> However, the recent movement towards organisational and domain-specific software reuse strategies has simplified the retrieval problem by narrowing the scope of the universe of discourse. This has enabled specialist techniques such as domain-modelling <ref> [103] </ref> and controlled-vocabulary [42] retrieval schemes to be applied with some success. Nevertheless there remains the desire to develop software retrieval strategies suited for large-scale, 125 6.1.

However, it is the dynamic behaviour of objects that is of the most concern when building applications [50, 99]. It is this behavioural view of retrieval that is discussed.

Reference-contexts: The retrieval schemes proposed in the literature can be categorised, based upon the technique used to represent components during the search process: Classification-based schemes: Assorted classification and indexing techniques, including keyword comparison, facet <ref> [104] </ref>, frame [22], descriptor [86], lexical affinity [80] and feature-based [15] schemes all seek to find relevant components based upon controlled vocabularies, properties and ontologies external to the component. <p> Querying by class and method name can be performed in many development environments. All the above libraries address Problem 2 by offering name-based search facilities which provide rudimentary querying capabilities. Many other search and retrieval strategies have been proposed <ref> [40, 104, 132] </ref>. Manual browsing of libraries is also a strategy addressing Problem 2. The sizes of the libraries under consideration are not so large as to render browsing infeasible. Pintado [98] suggests another strategy for large libraries, called "affinity browsing". <p> Each retrieval scheme will be formalised as a class of this general form. Faceted Scheme and Vocabulary The faceted scheme described here is a simple version of the scheme proposed in Prieto-Diaz <ref> [104] </ref>. Faceted classification schemes for retrieval consist of a collection of facets, 129 6.2.

Reference-contexts: The motivations and sophistication of the means used to define constraints determines the extent to which library quality is maintained. The notions of quality for functional descriptions of the real world and means for evaluating them are the subject of continuing research into software engineering notations (e.g. UML <ref> [105] </ref> (object-oriented notation), VDM [68] (formal notation), CSP [55] (concurrency notation)). 5.3.2 Inserting Object-Z Components In this section, the insertion of components into a library of Object-Z components is considered. In particular, we discuss the insertion of an operation into an existing class component.

Reference-contexts: It is often the case that condensed representations of components are used to facilitate an efficient search process. As mentioned in Section 6.2.1, condensed representations of components are called surrogates <ref> [109] </ref>. Searching proceeds readily when the forms of queries and surrogates are easily comparable. <p> As these strategies will not in general select identical sets of behaviours in B, both are employed in order to maximise the recall (defined to be ratio of the number of relevant retrievals to the number of relevant solutions <ref> [109] </ref>) of the retrieval process. These strategies are analogous to the behavioural filter function (see Section 6.5.3) which selects particular surrogates from a set of surrogates (in this case selecting behaviours from the behavioural projection B).

Reference-contexts: In general, there may be many relationships between two software components, any of which may be used as the basis for browsing and retrieval from a software library. One component may be a subtype [77] of another, be behaviourally compatible <ref> [114] </ref> with another, or be substitutable [29] with another. These notions all differ slightly in their definition. The subtype relationship in Liskov and Wing [77] (the Liskov Substitutability Principle) is concerned with being able to operate a component of a subtype as a component of its supertype. <p> These notions all differ slightly in their definition. The subtype relationship in Liskov and Wing [77] (the Liskov Substitutability Principle) is concerned with being able to operate a component of a subtype as a component of its supertype.

Reference-contexts: Many programmers maintain a personal library of code which may be reused in later projects. However, existing software libraries vary in scale from such personally maintained collections of code, through comprehensive domain-specific collections, to a number of very large domain-spanning libraries <ref> [39, 115] </ref>. There are several existing software library systems used in this chapter to highlight the cognitive design deficiencies. They are based on the languages Eiffel [86], C++[117], Smalltalk [47], and Java [73].

Reference-contexts: Current areas of research into interface-oriented languages (Java [73]), prototypical languages (SELF [122]), and subject-oriented programming [52, 96] all suggest that object-oriented component descriptions have shortcomings. To alleviate these shortcomings, disciplines to direct the use of component description languages (3C model <ref> [120] </ref>, RESOLVE [21], and Design Patterns [44]) have been proposed. These disciplines prescribe recommended styles of expression within some component description language. The choice of any single component description language for software libraries is not clear given the continuing evolution of component description languages.

Reference-contexts: Lins [76] defines a Modula-2 component library based upon data abstraction and notions of software components developed by Booch [14].

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, adoption of a reuse culture requires organisational change. Resistance to such change is pragmatically a real impediment to the introduction of reuse solutions. As a research field, software reuse has been steadily growing since the mid-eighties. Wegner <ref> [123] </ref> repeated and extended the idea of the manufacture of software components expressed by McIlroy [82]. <p> Useful software libraries should record ideas and outcomes generated during software developments in such a way as to enable other software engineers to understand them. In turn this can significantly ease the process of software engineering, by providing a source of verified software artefacts <ref> [82, 123] </ref>. The problems associated with communication of information have been examined by Norman [92] who shows how the field of cognitive psychology has progressed by using the idea of people having mental models of the artefacts with which they interact.

Reference-contexts: The inheritance relationship has been the subject of much debate in the literature; the main issue is how inheritance should and should not be used to develop software of quality. Wegner <ref> [124, 125] </ref> examines inheritance, defining inheritance of one component by another to be a mechanism for resource sharing (delegation).

Reference-contexts: Development of criteria for assessing the quality of component interfaces is an area of continuing research. Two criteria, the observability and controllability proferred by operations with respect to the state of the component are discussed in <ref> [126] </ref>. Of the libraries mentioned above, Meyer [87] provides the most comprehensive attempt at rationalising the design of software component libraries.

Reference-contexts: The argument was that reuse can only truly be achieved with a solid technical emphasis on component description languages. Other researchers have recognised that there are a number of difficulties with the object paradigm that need to be addressed. Weide and Hollingsworth <ref> [127] </ref> argue that properties of components should be locally certifiable to allow their reuse in larger systems. It is claimed that no language paradigm enforces this notion. It is also claimed that the principles of information hiding and encapsulation need re-investigation to allow open implementations [69]. <p> Weide and Hollingsworth <ref> [127] </ref> argue that insertion of a component should ensure its local certifiability. Griffiths [49] formally distinguishes between strictly modular properties of a component and properties which must be ensured within the context of a particular system. In general, the process of insertion of a component should consider: 28 2.4.

Reference-contexts: LIBRARY SCIENCE and classification. 2.1.1 Cataloging Traditionally, library holdings are described by a collection of catalogs. Each catalog contains a collection of entries, at least one entry for each artefact held by the library. Wynar <ref> [129, p9] </ref> identifies general requirements for a catalog. <p> The software library models constructed in Chapters 4 through 6 address these requirements. 12 2.1. LIBRARY SCIENCE 2.1.2 Classification Given a catalog, entries within the catalog can be classified into divisions. The purpose of classification <ref> [129, p317] </ref> "is to bring related items together in a helpful sequence from the general to the specific.....the ultimate aim of any classification system is to lead the patron to the items required." Various kinds of classification schemes have been proposed. <p> The idea is to maximise collocation, that is, the grouping of similar subjects together. Most recently, synthetic classification schemes provide many divisions within each subject, the divisions being defined using artificially but intuitively chosen criteria. A number of limitations of classification schemes are noted by Wynar <ref> [129, p325] </ref>: * Logical arrangement: the relative separation of potentially related subjects presents difficulties for any classification system. For example, history and social sciences are inter-related topics, since history illuminates the study of social sciences, yet history is influenced by social cultures.

Reference-contexts: Structural schemes: Type signature <ref> [131] </ref> and specification matching [40, 62, 106, 132] techniques seek to find relevant components based upon elements of the structure of software components. An external-static hybrid approach has been proposed in [36]. Behavioural schemes: Behavioural techniques seek to take advantage of the distinguishing property of software | executability. <p> It has been recognised that replacement d ? should be compatible in some way with removed component c?, to provide guarantees for clients of operation c? who subsequently use d ?. Generally, two forms of guarantees have been investigated: statically checkable guarantees such as signature <ref> [131] </ref> or type [18, 97] compatibility; and dynamic guarantees of behavioural compatibility as mentioned in Section 2.3.2. The operation RemoveOperation has been constructed by identifying all components possibly affected, and propagating change to them in form of operations DetachReference and DetachComponent . <p> be-havioural retrieval using the formal framework. 6.3 Signature Matching In this section a formal model for a signature-matching retrieval is presented according to the framework outlined in Section 6.2. 6.3.1 Scheme Name and Vocabulary The signature matching scheme described here is based upon the scheme proposed in Zaremski and Wing <ref> [131] </ref>, modified slightly to be applicable to object-oriented class declarations. The signature-matching scheme for reuse of class components primarily relies upon type-matching under type-transformations. Classes are represented by a multi-set of feature signatures, where a signature records the types of a feature in a class. <p> Signature transformations will be used in the definition of the Select search operation given later in this section. A signature transformation is modelled as a relation between signatures. SigTransform == Signature $ Signature Examples of signature transformations used in <ref> [131] </ref> are: flip; curry ; uncurry ; generalise; specialise : SigTransform For instance, the curry signature transformation changes function signatures of the form X fi Y ! Z to signatures of the form X ! Y ! Z . <p> The complete set of applicable transforms (i.e. relations) available in a signature-matching scheme is modelled by relation transforms using the type SigTransform. The relation transforms models the union of underlying transforms (i.e. relations). For example, the transforms relation in <ref> [131] </ref> would be defined as: transforms : SigTransform transforms = flip [ curry [ uncurry [ generalise [ specialise To further increase the recall of a query, a signature-matching retrieval scheme also has an ordering on signatures. <p> This definition of the set participants for a signature-matching scheme is formalised as the predicate: participants = fc : dom extract surrogate j dom extract surrogate (c) " sigs = ?g 6.3.5 Searching There are many signature and module matching mechanisms proposed in Zaremski and Wing <ref> [131] </ref>. The matching specified here, called Generalised relaxed fl match, is mentioned as the matching mechanism most likely to be used in practice. <p> The theory developed in this chapter shows that useful, exploitable structure does exist in behaviour. Until recently, most effort in solving the retrieval problem has gone into software classification, with emphasis upon domain-specific aspects such as the signature and specifications of operations <ref> [131, 132] </ref>, and the determination of static metrics that can be used when searching and retrieving [98, 103]. However, it is the dynamic behaviour of objects that is of the most concern when building applications [50, 99]. It is this behavioural view of retrieval that is discussed.

Reference-contexts: Structural schemes: Type signature [131] and specification matching <ref> [40, 62, 106, 132] </ref> techniques seek to find relevant components based upon elements of the structure of software components. An external-static hybrid approach has been proposed in [36]. Behavioural schemes: Behavioural techniques seek to take advantage of the distinguishing property of software | executability. Behaviour-based techniques [50, 89, 26 2.4. <p> Querying by class and method name can be performed in many development environments. All the above libraries address Problem 2 by offering name-based search facilities which provide rudimentary querying capabilities. Many other search and retrieval strategies have been proposed <ref> [40, 104, 132] </ref>. Manual browsing of libraries is also a strategy addressing Problem 2. The sizes of the libraries under consideration are not so large as to render browsing infeasible. Pintado [98] suggests another strategy for large libraries, called "affinity browsing". <p> Specification matching is the topic of the next section. 6.4 Specification Matching This section presents a formal model for specification-matching retrieval according to the framework outlined in Section 6.2. 6.4.1 Scheme Name and Vocabulary The specification-matching scheme described here is based upon the schemes proposed in Zaremski and Wing <ref> [132] </ref>. Specification matching primarily relies upon matching predicates in a logic, given a theory of predicate equivalence. Classes are represented by a collection of pairs of predicates; that is, the pre- and post- conditions of each class operation. <p> j let s == extract surrogate (c) * 9 p : dom s [ ran s * formula (p) formulae term (p) termsg The auxiliary functions formula and term respectively extract the formula symbols and ground terms from a predicate. 6.4.5 Searching There are many specification matching mechanisms proposed in <ref> [132] </ref>. The matching specified here is plug-in match; other matching mechanisms can be specified by selecting the ordering , adjusting the definition of Select and/or changing the transformations available. <p> The theory developed in this chapter shows that useful, exploitable structure does exist in behaviour. Until recently, most effort in solving the retrieval problem has gone into software classification, with emphasis upon domain-specific aspects such as the signature and specifications of operations <ref> [131, 132] </ref>, and the determination of static metrics that can be used when searching and retrieving [98, 103]. However, it is the dynamic behaviour of objects that is of the most concern when building applications [50, 99]. It is this behavioural view of retrieval that is discussed.
