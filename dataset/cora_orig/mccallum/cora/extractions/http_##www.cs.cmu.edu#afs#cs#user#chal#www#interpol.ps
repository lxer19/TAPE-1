Abstract: We present simple and fast algorithms for computing very tight upper and lower bounds on the prices of American Asian options in the binomial model. We introduce a new refined version of the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein [4] binomial lattice of stock prices. Each node in the lattice is partitioned into nodelets, each of which represents all paths arriving at the node with a specific geometric stock price average. The upper bound uses an interpolation idea similar to the Hull-White [5] method. From the backward-recursive upper-bound computation, we estimate a good exercise rule that is consistent with the refined lattice. This exercise rule is used to obtain a lower bound on the option price using a modification of a conditional-expectation based idea from Rogers-Shi [11] and Chalasani-Jha-Varikooty [3]. Our algorithms run in time proportional to the number of nodelets in the refined lattice, which is smaller than n 4 =20 for n periods.

Reference-contexts: The CRR Binomial Tree and Basic Notation We first establish the notation that we will use throughout this paper. We refer to the asset underlying the American Asian option as the stock, and make the standard assumption 4 CHALASANI, JHA, EGRIBOYUN, VARIKOOTY <ref> [1] </ref> that the price of the stock S (t) at time t satisfies the stochastic differential equation for geometric Brownian motion: dS (t) = S (t) dt + S (t) dB (t); where the annual drift rate and annual volatility are constant, and B (t) is a Brownian motion process.

Thus we are able to quickly produce a tight bracket around the option value. <p> Thus we are able to quickly produce a tight bracket around the option value. By contrast, Hull and White <ref> [5] </ref> show only how to compute an upper bound on the option price, but they are not able to estimate the error of their method since there is no satisfactory Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the price of an American Asian option. Our algorithms are based on two new ideas. <p> The quantity e A (k; h) can be thought of as a representative arithmetic average for the node. These quantities can be computed easily at each node by a simple forward induction on the lattice. Then compute the upper bound by backward-recursion and linear interpolation as in the Hull-White <ref> [5] </ref> method. Essentially, this method treats the option value at time k as a function of (H k ; A k ) and estimates this value at pairs (h; e A (k; h)) that correspond to the nodes (k; h) at level k. <p> The algorithm works along the same lines as the crude algorithm described in the introduction, except that we work on the refined lattice rather than on the original binomial lattice. The algorithm uses an interpolation idea similar to the one in Hull-White <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Similarly, x d (k; h) will not necessarily be a representative average at node (k + 1; h). We therefore use linear interpolation for these missing W values. A similar idea is used by Hull and White <ref> [5] </ref> to compute an upper bound on the Asian option price (see Section 6 for a more detailed comparison with their method). <p> Each of these takes time proportional to the total number of nodelets in the refined lattice, which is less than n 4 =20 for n 14. 6. Comparison with the Hull-White Method In this section we compare the accuracy our algorithms with those of Hull-White (HW) <ref> [5] </ref>, which is the previously best-known approximation method for American Asian options. One important advantage of our method is that we produce both an upper and lower bound on the option value, whereas the HW method only produces an upper bound. <p> Such path-clustering/conditioning ideas can have applications to other path-dependent options besides Asians. We are currently studying such an approach for the valuation of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which often have path-dependent pre-payment functions. For the options considered by Hull and White in <ref> [5] </ref>, our method in all cases produces a tighter upper-bound than theirs. Also in most cases the gap between our lower and upper bounds is smaller than 0:001.
