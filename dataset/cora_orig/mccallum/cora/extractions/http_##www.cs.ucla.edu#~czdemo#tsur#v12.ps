Abstract: fbkero, tsurg@dis.anl.gov Abstract. The IQ system, described in this paper, addresses two current problems in information retrieval (IR) from document repositories: (i) the "glut-of-information" that threatens to overwhelm the users of these systems and (ii) the loss of informational value as the documents are moved from their organizational setting into a machine-readable format. The answer to these problems discussed in the paper, proposes to restore much of this information by creating a context-base to store the additional recovered knowledge. The technology used is the LDL++ deductive database: we demonstrate how to use the rule-extensions to declare levels of abstraction in the information that can be used to "zoom-in" or "pan-out" as required by the user (an "Information Lens"). The system takes extensive advantage of the World-Wide Web and enlists the capabilities of JAVA for information display. We discuss some of the performance issues that were experienced and conclude with a description of future

Reference-contexts: The objectives of the IQ system are to effectively address these issues. The approach that we adopted was to augment the already existing information with contextual knowledge kept in a separate context base|a deductive database implemented in LDL++ <ref> [AOTZ] </ref>. The responses to user queries, returned from IR engines containing documentation sources, are elaborated using the context base and distributed using the World-Wide Web (WWW) in the form of JAVA applets 2 [GM95].

Reference-contexts: Sometimes, when the documents are voluminous, the actual document is kept in its original paper format and only a reference to it is kept as part of the corpus. For a short discussion of the users requirements in this area see <ref> [Cro95] </ref>. The user specification is submitted to the system in form of a query, and the system's response is returned in the form of a hit list. In this paper we will distinguish between "traditional" methods for information retrieval and "knowledge intensive" methods.

Reference-contexts: One of the strengths of SGML relates to its ability to mark up a document in a neutral way, independent of the many ways the document can be processed in the future. <ref> [Smi92] </ref> The tagged documents must conform to a DTD 5 . An SGML parser (e.g., SGMLS) can be used to infer the structure of the document through the use of its included tags and check to see whether it is compatible with its declared DTD.
