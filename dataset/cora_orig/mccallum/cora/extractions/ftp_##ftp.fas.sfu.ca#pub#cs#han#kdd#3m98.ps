Abstract: Multimedia data mining is the mining of high-level multimedia information and knowledge from large multimedia databases. A multimedia data mining system prototype, MultiMediaMiner, has been designed and developed. It includes the construction of a multimedia data cube which facilitates multiple dimensional analysis of multimedia data, primarily based on visual content, and the mining of multiple kinds of knowledge, including summarization, comparison, classification, association, and clustering.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been rapid progress in the field of data mining and data warehousing research, but nothing substantial in mining multimedia. Many data mining and data warehousing systems have been developed for mining knowledge in relational databases and data warehouses <ref> [4] </ref>. Multimedia has been the major focus for many researchers around the world. Many techniques for representing, storing, indexing, and retrieving multimedia data have been proposed. However, rare are the researchers who ventured in the multimedia data mining field. <p> Recent advances in the research on multimedia databases [7, 8, 5] enable creation of large multimedia databases which can be queried in an effective way. These advances, in combination with the research into multimedia database and advances in data mining in relational databases <ref> [4] </ref>, created a possibility for the creation of multimedia data mining systems. The current MultiMediaMiner system includes four data mining modules for mining knowledge in image and video databases: characterization, comparison, classification, and association. Additional modules are in the design and development stage.
