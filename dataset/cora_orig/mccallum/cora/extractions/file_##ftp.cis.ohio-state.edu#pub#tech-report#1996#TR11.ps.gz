Abstract: Modern computers are unable to store the complete data of high resolution medical images in main memory. Even on secondary memory (disk), such large datasets are sometimes stored in a compressed form. At rendering time, parts of the volume are requested by the ray tracing algorithm and are loaded from disk. If one is not careful, the same regions may be (decompressed and) loaded to memory several times. Instead, a coherent algorithm should be designed that minimizes this thrashing and optimizes the time and effort spent to (uncompress and) load the volume. We present an algorithm that divides the volume into cubic cells, each (compressed and) stored on disk, in contrast to the more common slice-based storage. At rendering time, each cell is allocated a queue of rays. For a sequence of images, all rays are spawned and queued at the cells they intersect first. Cells are loaded, one at a time, in front-to-back (FTB) order. A loaded cell is rendered by all rays found in its queue. We analyze the algorithm in detail and demonstrate its advantages over existing ray casting volume rendering.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is independent of the compression technique used, thus allowing higher compression ratios. The only assumption is that the compression is lossless and that the corresponding decompression routine is available at render-time <ref> [2] </ref>. Second, it can be used in conjunction with the methods for direct rendering of compressed volumes to exploit coherency to a far higher degree. The image quality will be the same as guaranteed by the respective algorithms. <p> We believe that the pain and effort taken in acquiring high resolution and high quality data, such in the Visible Human Project, cannot be compromised at rendering time by employing lossy compression techniques. Our algorithm preserves the accuracy of the direct volume renderer by employing lossless compression <ref> [2] </ref> (or no compression) while trying to optimize rendering time. The idea of thrashless volume rendering was first proposed for multicomputers by Westermann and Augustin [17], and later extended to multi-frame thrashlessness by Law and Yagel in [9]. <p> Each cell is optionally compressed and stored onto a disk. We assume that the corresponding decompression routine is available at rendering time. Compressing cells instead of the whole volume may lead to lower compression ratios <ref> [2] </ref>. Alternatively, very large volumes can also be divided and stored, as uncompressed cells, on distributed remote disks. The algorithm basically renders the original data, but uses an efficient ray traversal scheme to ensure that each cell is decompressed exactly once for a number of frames.

Reference-contexts: A more immediate requirement is to reduce the rendering time as far as possible, so that the frame generation time decreases. Several attempts have been made to conquer the visible human, some notable ones been described in [5]<ref> [6] </ref>[11][13][15]. In [6], an attempt has been made to develop a comprehensive virtual environment, including efficient segmentation and realistic ray tracing of the volume. In [15] the Visual Human is used as a basis for a comprehensive medical atlas.

Reference-contexts: The timings compare well with those reported for direct rendering of compressed volumes; in addition our algorithm does not compromise with accuracy. Currently, the rendering algorithm may not be optimal. Faster methods like <ref> [8] </ref>, when employed, are liable to improve the performance of the whole method. To incorporate illumination on the y, the cells have to be padded in each direction, the size of the pad depends on the number of neighbors used for normal calculations. FIGURE 3.

Reference-contexts: The idea of thrashless volume rendering was first proposed for multicomputers by Westermann and Augustin [17], and later extended to multi-frame thrashlessness by Law and Yagel in <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we extend the scope of this novel approach to the visualization of compressed or colossal volumes on uniprocessor machines. The algorithm described in [9] preserves thrashlessness across all the frames that share the same FTB order. <p> volume rendering was first proposed for multicomputers by Westermann and Augustin [17], and later extended to multi-frame thrashlessness by Law and Yagel in <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we extend the scope of this novel approach to the visualization of compressed or colossal volumes on uniprocessor machines. The algorithm described in [9] preserves thrashlessness across all the frames that share the same FTB order. In the next section, we briey explain the idea of multi-frame thrashless volume rendering, followed by a proposal (in Section 2.3) to extend the method to work for arbitrary sets of frames. <p> In Section 2.3, we have proposed an extension to this method, so that thrashlessness is maintained even for arbitrary jumps of the screen during the animation. 2.1 Multi-Frame Thrashless Volume Rendering Revisited In this section, we briey describe the idea of multi-frame thrashlessness. Refer to <ref> [9] </ref> for a detailed discussion. At rendering time, the list of cells is ordered in a front-to-back (FTB) manner depending on the position and orientation of the screen. This list is referred to as FTBL (Front-To-Back-List).

Palmer et al., [13] have gained speed by implementing a parallel volume renderer on clusters of shared-memory multiprocessors. Apart from using parallel computers, some researchers have taken a different 2 route to improve the performance of the rendering algorithm by suggesting coherent algorithms, as in [1][4][19].

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we thoroughly analyze our current implementation and suggest our conclusions in Section 4. 2. Method Volumes are compressed because they do not fit in secondary or primary memory. Efficient compression techniques <ref> [16] </ref> and direct volume visualization of compressed volumes [3][7][12] have been suggested. These algorithms generally compromise with accuracy, but with an a priori knowledge of the behavior of the data, very efficient schemes can be developed. In this paper, we take a different approach to visualize compressed volumes.
