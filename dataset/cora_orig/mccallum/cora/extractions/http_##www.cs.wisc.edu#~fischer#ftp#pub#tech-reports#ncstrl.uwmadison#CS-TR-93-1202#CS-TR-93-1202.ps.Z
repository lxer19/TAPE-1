Title: New Error Bounds for the Nonlinear Complementarity Problem  
Author: O. L. Mangasarian J. Ren 
Date: December 1993  
Abstract: A natural residual is shown to be globally "equivalent" to the distance between an arbitrary point and the unique solution to a strongly monotone nonlinear complementarity problem, under a Lipschitz continuity assumption. This extends Pang's error bound [10] to the nonlinear case. Under monotonicity alone, we show that this error residual is merely a "lower" error bound. In addition, we extend the linear complementarity error bound given in [7] to a global error bound for a strongly monotone nonlinear complementarity problem, without Lipschitz continuity. Comparisons among several residuals are given.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We consider the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP for short) of finding an x in IR n such that F (x) 0; x 0; xF (x) = 0; (1) where F is a function from IR n to IR n . The linear complementarity problem <ref> [1, 9] </ref> obtains when F (x) = Mx + q. A primary goal of this paper is to develop new error bounds for the nonlinear complementarity problem.

Then for each integer k, there exists an x k 6= x such that kx k xk &gt; k (s (x k ) + s (x k ) 4 Case 1. Let fx k g be unbounded.
