Abstract: Among packet-scheduling disciplines for providing end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees to different applications, including real-time services, two classes of algorithms have received particular attention: those based on Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) and those based on Earliest Deadline First (EDF). One reason for the popularity of GPS-based schemes is that their powerful properties can translate in simple Call Admission Control (CAC) procedures. The intense research on GPS has also resulted in very efficient implementation techniques, which have made the cost of these schedulers very affordable. The EDF discipline in conjunction with per-node traffic shaping (which we refer to as Rate-Controlled EDF (RC-EDF)) has also been recently proposed as a candidate for end-to-end QoS provisioning. However, an appropriate framework for CAC with RC-EDF has not been developed, nor the possible advantages of using RC-EDF in place of GPS have been properly characterized. Furthermore, the implementation complexity of an RC-EDF server is potentially very high, and no technique to reduce cost has been proposed. In this paper, we first formulate an end-to-end CAC framework for RC-EDF that can be implemented in practice. Then, using this framework, we numerically compare the schedulable regions of RC-EDF and GPS and show that, when the traffic mix in the network consists of connections with both stringent and loose delay requirements, RC-EDF can substantialy outperform GPS in the number of admitted connections, and thus achieve much higher network utilization. Finally, we propose a technique to substantially reduce the implementation complexity of a RC-EDF server.

Finally, Section 6 offers some concluding remarks. 2 Background 2.1 Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) The GPS service discipline (on which all GPS-related schemes are based) has been described and analyzed in <ref> [4, 9] </ref>. <p> The advantage of imposing this restriction is that the end-to-end delay bounds can be promptly computed for a ( i ; i ) leaky bucket 2 constrained connection as <ref> [9] </ref>: D i = g i K i X ( g i L where g i is the rate allocated to connection i, K i is the number of switches in the connection's path, r k is the service rate at the k-th switch, and L is the packet size. <p> Overall, the bandwidth r k P i cannot be used, even though additional connections with larger end-to-end delays guarantees could have been accommodated. 1 Historically, this form of GPS has been referred to as Rate Proportional Processor Sharing (RPPS) <ref> [9, 2] </ref>, but the distinction is not carried over in most of the literature, where RPPS is still called GPS, probably because it is the only way that the GPS framework is used in practice. <p> When g i is much larger than i (as is often the case with bursty real-time traffic), this leads to low link utilizations. A more exact delay computation technique, which would lead to a more accurate CAC, is described in <ref> [9] </ref>. This method allows different weights to be assigned to a connection at each of the switches on its path, and takes into account traffic interactions among connections sharing an output link; this requires the characterization of the traffic of a connection as it crosses successive switches on its path.

Reference-contexts: However, since the computation of the schedulable region in EDF requires precise knowledge of the traffic at the input of a node, the use of EDF for end-to-end guarantees in a multi-node network is problematic. As a possible solution to extend EDF to the multi-node scenario, the work in <ref> [15, 16] </ref> has suggested the use of EDF in conjunction with per-node traffic shaping (in this paper, we refer to this combination as Rate-Controlled EDF (RC-EDF)). In [16], RC-EDF has been shown to at least match GPS performance. <p> This problem is not peculiar of EDF, but is common to any scheduling discipline (we have seen a similar situation for the exact delay computation in GPS in Section 2.1 above). As a general framework to handle the multinode problem, Zhang and Ferrari in <ref> [15] </ref> propose a class of schemes called Rate-Controlled Service (RCS) disciplines which reshape the traffic at each hop within the network.

In <ref> [16] </ref>, RC-EDF has been shown to at least match GPS performance. A number of aspects related to RC-EDF have not been addressed in literature. <p> As schematically shown in Fig. 3, a RCS server has two components, a shaper which reshapes the traffic of each connection, and a scheduler which receives packets released by the shaper and schedules them according to a specific scheduling discipline, such as EDF. Georgiadis et al. in <ref> [16] </ref> build upon this model and derive expressions for the end-to-end delay bounds in terms of the shaper envelope and scheduling delay at each node. <p> It chooses an appropriate shaper with envelope E i (t) for the connection, and computes the corresponding delay D ( A i k E i ) (the delay computation is described in <ref> [16] </ref>). 2. The k-th switch on the path is assigned a delay bound d k i such that D ( A i k E i ) + k d k i = D i . <p> The connection is admitted only if every switch on the path can accommodate the connection. The results in <ref> [16] </ref> can be used for choosing the shaper envelope and for splitting the total scheduling delay among the schedulers on the path. <p> we compute the maximum number of type-0 connections that can be admitted in the network using each of the two schemes. (In other words, we characterize the number of type-0 connections, subject to type-1 background traffic through both switches, and type-2 and type-3 cross-traffic at each switch.) The authors in <ref> [16] </ref> have already shown that RC-EDF can match GPS performance; we carry the argument further and show that in some situations RC-EDF can accept many more connections than GPS. <p> small (e.g., 64), the complexity of the sorting operation is also relatively small, and is independent of the number of connections sharing the link. 6 Conclusions EDF scheduling with per-node traffic shaping (which we have called RC-EDF) has been proposed as a solution to use EDF in a multi-node network <ref> [16] </ref>. In this paper, we have addressed a number of issues to make RC-EDF scheduling a practical candidate for deployment in broadband networks. We have first formulated a CAC framework for RC-EDF that can be implemented in practice and is more powerful than what achievable in GPS.
