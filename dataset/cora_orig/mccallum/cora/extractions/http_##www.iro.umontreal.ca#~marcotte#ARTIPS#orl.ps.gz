Title: MODIFIED DESCENT METHODS FOR SOLVING THE MONOTONE VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY PROBLEM  
Author: D.L. Zhu and P. Marcotte 
Keyword: Variational inequalities. Descent methods. Projection. Global convergence.

Abstract: Recently, Fukushima proposed a differentiable optimization framework for solving strictly monotone and continuously differentiable variational inequalities. The main result of this paper is to show that Fukushima's results can be extended to monotone (not necessarily strictly monotone) and Lipschitz continuous (not necessarily continuously differentiable) variational inequalities, if one is willing to modify slightly the basic algorithmic scheme. The modification applies also to a general descent scheme introduced by Zhu and Marcotte.

Reference-contexts: More recently, researchers have investigated the direct minimization of merit, or "gap" functions. In particular, Marcotte [4] has proposed a nondifferentiable optimization algorithm for minimizing the gap function g (x) = max hF (x); x yi; (2) under a monotonicity assumption for F . Recently, Fukushima <ref> [1] </ref> reformulated the VIP as the unconstrained mathematical program min g ff (x); (3) where g ff (x) = max hF (x); x yi 2ff G (4) and kxk G = hx; Gxi denotes the norm induced by the symmetric, positive definite matrix G. <p> The main advantage of Fukushima's gap function over (2) is that if F is continuously differentiable, so is g ff , whenever ff is finite. Fukushima <ref> [1] </ref> developed an algorithm for solving the VIP based on the direct minimization of g ff , for finite values of the parameter ff. However, the strict descent property could only be demonstrated when F was strictly monotone and continuously differentiable on C. <p> : As in the proof of Proposition 3, we obtain 1 (g ff k 1 (x k 0 )) 2 ) x k 0 G flg ff k 1 (x k 0 where x k 0 t = x k 0 ) x k 0 ) for some t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If the mapping F is only monotone, a variation of the projection algorithm known as the extragradient method (see Khobotov <ref> [2] </ref>) generates a sequence of feasible points whose (unknown!) distance to the set of equilibrium solutions decreases at each iteration. The advantage of a descent approach to the VIP is to minimize, from iteration to iteration, a measure of proximity of the current iterate to an equilibrium solution.

Reference-contexts: Throughout the paper, it will be assumed that the solution set of the VIP is nonempty. This will be the case if the set C is compact, among other sufficient conditions (see Hartmann and Stampacchia <ref> [3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For instance, the differences of successive iterates x k x k+1 generated by the classical projection algorithm define a contracting sequence, whenever the mapping F is strongly monotone (see Pang and Chan <ref> [5] </ref>). If the mapping F is only monotone, a variation of the projection algorithm known as the extragradient method (see Khobotov [2]) generates a sequence of feasible points whose (unknown!) distance to the set of equilibrium solutions decreases at each iteration.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of a descent approach to the VIP is to minimize, from iteration to iteration, a measure of proximity of the current iterate to an equilibrium solution. The idea is not new: back in 1951, J. Robinson <ref> [6] </ref> proved the convergence of the fictitious play method for solving 2-person zero-sum games, an instance of skew-symmetric linear VIPs, by showing that the iterates were minimizing, although not monotonically, a certain merit function. More recently, researchers have investigated the direct minimization of merit, or "gap" functions.
