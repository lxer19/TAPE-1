Abstract: Often the structure of discrete sets can be described in terms of a closure operator. When each closed set has a unique minimal generating set (as in convex geometries in which the extreme points of a convex set generate the closed set), we have an antimatroid closure space. In this paper, we show there exist antimatroid closure spaces of any size, of which convex geometries are only a sub-family, all of whose closed sets are generated by precisely the same number of points. We call them uniform closure spaces. The issue of whether a planar convex geometry, that is a discrete set of points in in the plane, exists in which all convex configurations are triangles, with no quadrilaterals; or as quadrilaterals and triangles, with no pentagons; etc., has fascinated combinatorial mathematicians for many years. Our results throw light on these kinds of questions, even though they do not resolve them. fl Research supported in part by DOE grant DE-FG05-95ER25254.

Reference-contexts: This sublattice of closed subsets is lower semimodular; 3 that is, if Z covers Y 1 and Y 2 , then Y 1 and Y 2 must cover a common closed set X. 4 Edelman <ref> [3] </ref> has pushed this further and demonstrated that every antimatroid is meet distributive. Generators are connected to the corresponding closed sets that they generate by dashed lines generally inclined from lower right to the upper left.

For example, there exist at least 202 distinct closure spaces comprised of 5 elements.

The n points may be a simple closed convex set, or may include other points in its interior, in which case it is a non-simple generating set.

Reference-contexts: It is not hard to show that closure operators which satisfy this additional axiom are uniquely generated in the sense that for any set Y , there exists a unique minimal set X Y such that X:' = Y:'. One can also show <ref> [14] </ref> that Theorem 1.1 A closure operator is uniquely generated if and only if it satisfies the anti-exchange property if p; q 62 Y:' then p 2 (Y [ fqg):' implies q 62 (Y [ fpg):'. <p> Similarly, there are many different closure operators, '. 3 The term "basis" has so many connotations, especially with respect to vector spaces and their change of basis, that we prefer the more neutral "generator". 2 Antimatroid closure spaces have been studied in <ref> [14] </ref>, in which the subsets X; Y U are partially ordered by ' , where X ' Y if and only if Y " X:' X Y:' (1) This is a partial order on all the subsets of U, not just its closed subsets. <p> In this case, the minimal and maximal points of Y constitute its generators. Figure 1 (a) is a typical poset on 6 points; Figure 1 (b) illustrates its closure lattice, L (U;' C ) . The regularity of structure suggested by this figure really exists, c.f. <ref> [14] </ref>. The collection of closed subsets, for which Y = Y:', forms a sublattice [; abcdef ], denoted in this figure by bolder strings and joined by solid lines that are generally inclined from the lower left to the upper right which denote covering relationships. <p> The dotted lines denote a few of the covering relationships between non-closed elements in different boolean intervals. These covering relationships, which we denote by X ' Y , do indeed echo those of the closed subgraph sublattice. In particular, we have the following results from <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> Chordal graphs under monophonic closure [6] also have closure dimension = 2.
