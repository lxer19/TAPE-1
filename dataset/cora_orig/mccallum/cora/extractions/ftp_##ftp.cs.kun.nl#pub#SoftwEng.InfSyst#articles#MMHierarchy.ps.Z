Title: The Meta Model Hierarchy: A Framework for Information Systems Concepts and Techniques  
Author: J.L.H. Oei L.J.G.T van Hemmen E.D. Falkenberg S. Brinkkemper 
Date: 29 July 1992  
Abstract: The numerous information systems design methods and specification techniques being proposed, can be compared on the basis of different criteria. In this paper a framework for ordering information systems modelling techniques based on meta models is proposed. This framework, called the Meta Model Hierarchy, positions each technique according to an analysis of the distinctions between the basic concepts, and the set of constraints defined on these concepts. Relations between meta models are distinguished: partitioning, restriction, and degeneration. Each modelling technique is then positioned in the Meta Model Hierarchy according to these order relations. The positioning of Entity-Relationship Modelling, NIAM and Petri-nets in the Meta Model Hierarchy is discussed as an illustration of the use of the approach.

Reference-contexts: particular 10 application model, should be conform the meta concept structure, and satisfy the set of meta constraints: mm =S,C IsPop (mm,Pop) IsPop (S,Pop) "c C [Pop C] (Pop: O fi Powerset (W), where W is the set of all possible instances) For axioms on this structure we refer to <ref> [BHW91] </ref>. Note that in the meta language we speak about specialization in general, whereas in the Meta Model Hierarchy specializations are restricted by some additional constraints (ie. mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive). In that case we will speak of partitioning. <p> x is a partitioning of y. x Part y x Part' y $z: z Part' y x Part z where x Part' y Spec (x) Spec (y) Object (x) Object (y) Constr (x)"Constr (y) = -total (Object (x)"Object (y)), exclusion (Object (x)"Object (y))- where total and exclusion as defined in <ref> [BHW91] </ref>. A meta model x is said to be a partitioning of meta model y iff the concept structure of meta model x can be derived from the concept structure of meta model y by the partitioning of one or more concepts. <p> This dichotomy is added to the root meta model by partitioning the meta concept Object into Object_Type and Object_Instance. The resulting meta model is called PM * (see figure 4.6), because it is closely related to the Predicator Model as defined in <ref> [BHW91] </ref>. The relationship introduced between Object type and Object instance can be derived from the additional partitionings of the meta concepts Role and Composed_Object by identifying the Role instances used in a Composed_object. Subtype defining rules are also defined in terms of the role instances.

Reference-contexts: Figure2.2 Relating techniques by ordering their meta models Nowadays, meta modelling is a commonly accepted means for information systems research. An overview of applications can be found in <ref> [Bri90] </ref> and in [TL92]. The ordering of meta models in the Meta Model Hierarchy allows to utilize the mutual dependencies between the meta models. <p> Entity Relationship Modelling has even more dialects and extensions. We consider here the original one of [Che76] which requires binary relationships and disallow objectified relationships, i.e. relationships which can also be entities themselves. The metamodel of ERM which is a simplification of the meta model presented in <ref> [Bri90] </ref> can be found in figure 4.4. The considered meta model abstracts from cardinality constraints and identification structures. 4.2.3 A meta model for Petri-Nets Petri-Nets ([Petterson81]) is a state-transition oriented modelling technique which is able to model activities and their inter-relationships, in particular concurrency and casualty.

Reference-contexts: Up to now, expressive power is mostly compared by defining transformations on the application level. That is, given a particular application model described in one technique transformations are defined to an equivalent application model in the other technique, and vice versa. In <ref> [HO92] </ref> it is shown that it is also possible to compare the expressive power of different techniques by defining appropriate transformations on the meta level. To compare the expressive power of techniques, transformations are defined between the meta models of these techniques to a common (meta-)technique.
