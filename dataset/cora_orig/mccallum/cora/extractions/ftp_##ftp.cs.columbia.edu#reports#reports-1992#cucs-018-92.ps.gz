Abstract: An "electronic coin scheme" as defined by Chaum, Fiat, and Naor [5] is a collection of protocols to achieve untraceable, unforgeable coins with o*ine purchasing; this is the minimum set of properties to make electronic money useful. We give a new electronic coin scheme that is simple and practical. Withdrawal requires only two rounds of interaction, while purchase and deposit are non-interactive; all previous efficient cash schemes require interaction (cut-and-choose) for purchases. Moreover, messages during purchase and deposit contain only a few encrypted values, independent of the tolerable probability of cheating. We present a security model for electronic coins, and prove the security of our scheme relative to certain specific cryptographic assumptions (hardness of Discrete Log and possibility of secure blind signature).

Reference-contexts: An "electronic coin scheme" is, informally stated, a collection of protocols that achieve the first four of these properties; this is the minimum set of properties to make electronic money useful.

Reference-contexts: The first one is that the discrete logarithm problem is hard. This is a standard cryptographic assumption first used by Diffie and Hellman <ref> [8] </ref>. Anonymity of purchases in our scheme depends on this assumption. Discrete Log Assumption: Let p be a prime, let g be a generator of Z fl p , and let a be an integer between 0 and p 1.

Reference-contexts: Our assumption is in terms of a very general type of attack on any signature scheme: existential forgery under an adaptive chosen plaintext attack (defined by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest <ref> [11] </ref>). A signature scheme fails this attack if a polynomial-time adversary, after being allowed to see the signature of polynomially many messages of its choosing, can construct the signature of any new message.

Reference-contexts: discrete logs modulo p are difficult to compute, this probability will always be quite small (see next subsection). 4.4 Practical Considerations How large should coins be in practice? We take 150 decimal digits as a reasonable size for p to insure that the discrete logarithm problem is hard (see, e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>), and as a reasonable size for an RSA modulus.
