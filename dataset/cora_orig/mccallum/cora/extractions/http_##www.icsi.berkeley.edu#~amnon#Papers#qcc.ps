Abstract: Sampling is an important primitive in probabilistic and quantum algorithms. In the spirit of communication complexity, given a function f : X fi Y ! f0; 1g and a probability distribution D over X fi Y , we define the sampling complexity of (f; D) as the minimum number of bits Alice and Bob must communicate for Alice to pick x 2 X and Bob to pick y 2 Y as well as a value z s.t. the resulting distribution of (x; y; z) is close to the distribution (D; f(D)). In this paper we initiate the study of sampling complexity, in both the classical and quantum model. We give several variants of the definition. We completely characterize some of these tasks, and give upper and lower bounds on others. In particular, this allows us to establish an exponential gap between quantum and classical sampling complexity, for the set disjointness function. This is the first exponential gap for any task where the classical probabilistic algorithm is allowed to err.

Reference-contexts: The first demonstration of that was in [4] where it was shown that if the two parties share predefined entangled qubits (that are absolutely independent of the message) then Alice can communicate 2n classical bits to Bob using only n communication qubits. Another example was recently supplied by <ref> [2] </ref> where Alice's task is to encode m classical bits into n qubits (m &gt; n) such that Bob can choose to read any one of the m encoded bits of his choice (thereby possibly destroying the information about the remaining m 1 bits).

Reference-contexts: On the positive side they showed a scheme for beating Holevo's bound by a constant factor, but on the negative side they showed that m can be no larger than n log n. A rich hunting ground for such examples is the communication complexity model [18, 17]. <ref> [5] </ref> showed that if Alice and Bob get two subsets of [1::n] and they wish to compute whether their sets intersect or not, then even though any classical probabilistic protocol must exchange a linear number of bits, the task can be carried out with only square root as many quantum bits. <p> The result is based on Grover's quantum search algorithm [9].

For completeness we give the proof in the appendix. 1.5 A Tight Bound on q-Sampling The next theorem completely characterizes the complexity of q-sampling. <p> In fact <ref> [6] </ref> proved a stronger version with better constants that works even when the two parties share entangled qubits. Yet our lower bound applies also for the q-sampling case. 1.6. <p> As a result any lower bound technique that proves a lower bound on sampling breaks down when the two parties are allowed to use entanglement, and any lower bound technique that is powerful enough to prove a lower bound even in the presence of entanglement (as the lower bound of <ref> [6] </ref> for the Inner Product function) does not extend to the sampling case. 2. Preliminaries A classical distribution over X is a function D : X 7! [0; 1] s.t. x2X D (x) = 1.

Reference-contexts: She then sends to Bob who can measure in an arbitrary way to get a classical random variable Y . The question is what is the maximal amount of mutual information between X and Y ? More than two decades ago Holevo <ref> [10] </ref> proved that the answer is n. That is, although 2 n 1 complex numbers are necessary to specify the state of n quantum bits, only n bits of information can be retrieved from the superposition, and communicating qubits is not more useful than just communicating classical bits.

Reference-contexts: Given an N fi N matrix M , M M y is a non-negative matrix and hence has a complete set of non-negative eigenvalues 1 : : : N 0. The i'th singular value, i (M ), is p i . We use a lower bound technique from <ref> [11] </ref> (where it is attributed to Yao) and prove: Theorem 1 For any pure state and 0 * 1 2 , let K * be the first integer K s.t. K i=1 2 have dlog K 2* e * Q * ( ) dlog K * e. <p> A Lower Bound The lower bound idea is an extension of an idea from Kremer's thesis <ref> [11] </ref> where it is attributed to Yao. We first show that the outcome of any quantum protocol that uses only l communication qubits can be described as a linear combination of up to 2 l product superposi-tions (we give a precise statement soon). <p> We use this to show that a quantum sampling protocol is actually a low rank approximation of M . We then use the Hoff-man Wielandt inequality to derive a lower bound on l. Claim 3.1 <ref> [11] </ref> Suppose P is a quantum protocol that uses l communication qubits, starts with no input and computes the superposition . Further assume that the last qubit communicated is w l . <p> Zero Error Sampling Finally we show a lower bound on zero error sam pling. The lower bound idea is similar to that in Theorem 1 and is an adaptation of ideas from Kremer's thesis <ref> [11] </ref> where it is attributed to Yao. Given a protocol P for sampling f we define the jXj fi jY j matrix M 0 P by letting M 0 P [x; y] be the probability that P samples (x; y) with the answer 0. <p> We similarly define M 1 P . We let M P = M 0 P . Note that M P does not necessarily correspond any more to the probability the protocol answers with a yes or no to an instance (x; y). Lemma 7.1 <ref> [11] </ref> Suppose P uses only l communica tion qubits. Then Rank (M 0 P ); Rank (M 1 P ) 2 2l . Proof: Let P be a quantum protocol for sampling f using l qubits.

Reference-contexts: We apply the above theorem to the DISJ k under the uniform distribution. To analyze the spectrum of M DISJ k we use a result by Lovasz <ref> [12] </ref>. We get: Theorem 3 For k = fi ( p ffi Q * (DISJ k ) = O (log (n) log ( 1 * )). The result is true even when Alice has an input S, and Bob wants to sample a set T dis joint from S. <p> We note that M [x; y] depends only on the intersection size of x and y. It is not too hard to see that all matrices that are indexed by k-subsets and depend only on the intersection size commute. In particular they share the same eigenspaces. Lovasz <ref> [12] </ref> analyzed the spectrum of these matrices. Here we give a slightly different description of the eigenspaces of M : Lemma 5.1 ([12], a different presentation) M has k + 1 eigenspaces E 0 ; : : : ; E k .

We can replace the expression log (Rank (M f )) with ffi Q 0 (f ). <p> This is in sharp contrast to the computational scenario where an extra round can supply an exponential speedup (for details see <ref> [15] </ref>). We also note that with public random coins, sampling (both quantum and classical) is easy. Thus, public coins are much more powerful than private coins in the sampling model. On the other hand, public coins are almost equivalent to private ones in the computational model ([13, 15]).
