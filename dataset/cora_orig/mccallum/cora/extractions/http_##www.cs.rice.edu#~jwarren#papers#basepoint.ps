Title: Multi-sided rational surface patches with independent boundary control  
Author: Joe Warren 
Address: Houston, Tx 77584  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Rice University  
Abstract: This paper shows that any rational surface scheme permitting the independent control of non-adjacent boundary curves must produce parameterizations possessing base points. Locating these base points allows for a classification of possible multi-sided rational surface schemes.

Reference-contexts: Rational surfaces have also been used to solve several important problems in CAGD. For example, (Gregory 1974) uses rational surface patches 1 2 Multi-sided Rational Surface Patches to fill 4-sided holes smoothly even in the presence of incompatible edge twists. <ref> (Loop and DeRose 1989, Warren 1992) </ref> and others use rational surface patches to fill multi-sided holes. Each of these techniques produces rational surfaces with an interesting property. <p> Likewise, the linear precision property for barycentric coordinates implies that the Bernstein/Bezier functions of degree k form a basis for the polynomials of degree k <ref> (Loop and DeRose 1989) </ref>. <p> An alternative approach is to build an n-sided rational surface patch that is the image of an n-sided parametric domain. (Charrot and Gregory 1984) takes this approach in creating pentagonal surface patches. <ref> (Loop and DeRose 1989) </ref> generalizes this approach to arbitrary polygonal domains. (Wachspress 1975) gives a similar construction in terms of finite elements. The key to the construction of Loop and DeRose is the generalization of barycentric coordinates to arbitrary convex polygons.
