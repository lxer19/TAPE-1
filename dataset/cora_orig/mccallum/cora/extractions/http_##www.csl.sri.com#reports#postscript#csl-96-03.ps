Title: Gateway Based Approach for Conducting Multiparty Multimedia Sessions over Heterogeneous Signaling Domains  
Author: Madhu Sudan and Nachum Shacham 
Affiliation: Computer Science Laboratory, SRI International  
Abstract: Emerging networking technologies tend to be introduced complete with their own protocols for resource management; for example, routing, resource reservation, and signaling. Each network offers a quality of service (QOS) interface, and applications take advantage of network signaling to demand and reserve predictive service. Whereas such interaction enhances the performance of applications that run on a specific network, it creates a challenge for applications that run over a heterogeneous infrastructure spanning multiple signaling domains. We present an approach for managing multiparty, multimedia sessions in a heterogeneous internetwork spanning multiple signaling domains and diverse link capacities. Participants utilize the native signaling on their respective domains and interact with participants on other domains through signaling gateways that bridge the domains and provide translation of signaling procedures and QOS semantics. Data streams are transmitted using a hierarchical representation, which allows participants to individually tune the quality of each stream they receive to their resources and interests. We present a particular design and implementation details for connecting ATM and IP signaling domains and discuss its extension to an arbitrary number of interconnected domains.

Reference-contexts: For example, the existing approach in the current Internet is to use the IP protocol suite as the universal protocol. A considerable amount of research has been done in order to find efficient ways of implementing IP over different networking technologies, especially ATM <ref> [CSV96, Mil95, Lau94, PLM + 95, Arm96] </ref>. With IP as the unifying framework, the only signaling protocol is RSVP [ZDE + 93]. Although attractive, this approach is not trivial to implement.

Reference-contexts: Different shades represent different multicast addresses (and hence different layers). 2.2 HMC over IP/RSVP Network IP multicast <ref> [DC90] </ref> has received wide acceptance and is the standard method for multidestination distribution of messages and monolithic streams over the Internet. The simplest way to implement HMC over IP multicast is to assign different layers to different multicast addresses.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in addition to heterogeneity in the physical media and switching techniques, the current networks have introduced signaling heterogeneity as well. For instance, the Reservation Protocol (RSVP) [ZDE + 93] and the User Network Interface (UNI) <ref> [For93] </ref> are the signaling protocols for the IP suite and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, respectively.

Reference-contexts: These examples demonstrate another facet of Heterogeneous MultiCast (HMC), which is a paradigm for operating multimedia multiparty sessions in environments where the participants differ in the constraints they impose on the session and receive different levels of service. The HMC concept, first suggested in <ref> [Sha92] </ref>, originally addressed the issues of different transmission and reception capacities available to the session participants. Enhanced signaling and hierarchical encoding of the real-time streams enable participants to customize the fidelity of their reception to their individual needs and constraints.

A detailed analysis of admission control criteria can be found in <ref> [SY96] </ref>. 10 The RESV messages are sent once every refresh period. 18 It is preferable that all the layers of a stream follow the same path in the network. If the layers arrive at the destination via different paths, synchronization problems will occur at the receiver.

However, RSVP currently lacks two aspects of support for layered streams, namely, (1) the ability to make group reservations and (2) the performing of ordered admission control.
