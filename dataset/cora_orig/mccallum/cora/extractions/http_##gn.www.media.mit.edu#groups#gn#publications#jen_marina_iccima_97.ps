Abstract: We are developing design principles applying tangible interfaces to storytelling. This paper describes an underlying philosophy and three resultant designs for computer-mediated toys, exploring how the merging of physical objects with computer technology can enhance childrens storytelling. Each prototype aims to develop a specific set of both oral and written storytelling skills, as well as collaboration, sharing, and the notion of revision. By creating narratives, children learn about culture and identity, and develop a sense of self. In addition, narrative can be used as a gateway to draw girls into technology. The use of multi-sensory interfaces allows for richer interaction. M o t iv at i o n Storytelling plays an essential role in childrens exploration of self, by affecting three aspects of development: 1) cognitive, 2) emotional, and 3) social. 1) Cognitively, we perceive the world in a narrative manner [3]. People organize their world and make sense of their lives by creating coherent narratives which change according to context. 2) The construction of narratives is emotionally empowering. Converting an idea into a story, and then sharing it, builds self-esteem. 3) Storytelling is an intuitive form of social interaction specifically geared towards sharing and relationship-building. Teller and listener can be temporally together, engaged in collaboration with feedback loop. Or a storyteller may construct a story alone, and later share it with others. In addition to these three developmental aspects, storytelling is a form of play particularly appealing to girls [10] It can, therefore, serve to draw them into technology. Lastly, stories give meaning to objects; objects give stories tangibility. We place meaning into the everyday objects which surround us, using them as placeholders for our personal narratives. These objects, therefore, become external anchors to who we are and how others see us. Background We organize our theoretical framework in four domains: 1) role of identity, history, memories, and culture, 2) storytelling and narrative, 3) gender issues in toys and game design, and 4) integration of physical and digital worlds.

Reference-contexts: We are looking specifically at the effect of such integrated interfaces with regard to children, gender differences, storytelling, and toys and games, by building upon the design concept of tangible media [12], and furthering the applications of computer-augmented toys [25]. Barthes <ref> [1] </ref> writes that the child "creates forms which walk, which roll, he creates life not property: objects now act by themselves, they are no longer an inert and complicated material in the palm of his hand." In the early 70s he was talking about simple inanimate toys.

Reference-contexts: Toys are the visible tools of early socialization, preparing children for adult roles [16]. In 1989, 93.5% of computer science and engineering faculty was male, with one third of the departments having no female faculty at all <ref> [4] </ref>. The gender-technology relationship is a negotiation. Gender itself is not an issue, but rather the process of identification having as background the common social humanity of women and men.[14].

Reference-contexts: Narratives are a valuable transformation tool for 2 education. Story production develops content knowledge, structural knowledge of types of narratives [11], and context awareness by reflecting variations in the narrator-listener relationship. Traditionally, storytelling belonged to the oral tradition. By using computational-augmented objects to tell stories <ref> [28, 7, 14] </ref>, to the oral and written modes, another dimension can be added: space. 3. Gender issues in toy and game design A childs initial introduction to digital technology is through computers or video games. <p> The oral storytelling becomes the seed for a rich interaction, where the child learns about writing and editing, and is empowered by the act of creation and sharing the story. The stories are preserved, becoming a rich source of history and memories <ref> [7] </ref>, archiving the childs development. 4 Show & Tell This design is a physical instantiation of the old-fashioned round-robin story game in which kids collaboratively build a story by adding sentences. Show & Tell was implemented as a Wizard of Oz experiment by Umaschi.

Reference-contexts: 1. Identity through Objects and Stories We surround ourselves with objects to aid in the establishment, expression, and maintenance of self-identity. Gonzalez <ref> [8] </ref> defines this grouping of objects as an autotopography, a spatial representation of identity. Objects are a physical embodiment of aspects of the self, providing external proof and support of identity. Such objects anchor the individuals constantly changing sense of self, by serving as placeholders to their personal narratives. <p> Later, Pam invites her friends to play with her Family Blocks and listen to her favorite stories. 3 Implementation This prototype was implemented using the resistor-based technology developed by Borovoy [2]. Each Lego object has a unique value which is read by the Handy Board <ref> [8] </ref>. This microcontroller talks via the serial port with a multimedia storytelling application specially designed with Macromedia Director to allow story planning. This application allows creation of stories by using a library of situation words like who, where, when, how, and what, key elements for building story events.

Reference-contexts: An old teddy bear, handed down, might hold stories written by older siblings or their grandmother when she was young, giving the child a sense of family, history, continuity. The Legos, each with a resistor inside it, are placed on a baseplate, designed by Martin and Borovoy <ref> [17] </ref>, which scans the rows and columns looking for resistances. By placing Legos on the baseplate, they become interactive. The baseplate identifies the Legos by their resistances and, as the child builds upwards, continually adds up the resistances in order to identity growing structures.

Reference-contexts: At the individual level, we weave a narration of our own lives to construe our role in the world. At the cultural level, narrative gives cohesion to shared beliefs and transmits values. 2.

Stories are considered by teachers and educational researchers as one of the most effective teaching methods [18]. <p> Collective storytelling has already a long tradition in children's games. The challenge is to leverage those games by incorporating technology. Some computer storytelling games are looking to bridge geographical gaps by allowing collaborative real time story construction over the Web <ref> [20] </ref>, Show & Tell specifically looks to enhance, with computationally-augmented toys, collaborative storytelling of children who share the same physical space. C o n c l u s i o n s Computationally-augmented toys are a powerful way of introducing children, especially girls, to the world of technology and storytelling.

Reference-contexts: On the screen appear the written stories, which Maria edits with the computers encouragement. Implementation The Rosebud prototype was designed and is being implemented by Glos. The stuffed animal has within it an IR chip, designed by Poor <ref> [21] </ref>, which transmits an identity signal the computer reads when the child picks it up and holds it in front of the computer. The computer can then link the audio and text stories to that particular ID tag, so that a particular stuffed animal activates its own stories.

Reference-contexts: Such objects anchor the individuals constantly changing sense of self, by serving as placeholders to their personal narratives. In this sense, they serve as archivists of the individual. The stories the objects hold are fundamental constituents of our memory. A story is composed of memories, experiences, knowledge and/or reflections <ref> [24] </ref>. It gives life to past experiences by making the events in memory significant to others and to ourselves. To become masters of our own experiences, we must be able to narrate them.
