Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Biomolecular computation is a new vista of computation that bridges between computer science and biochemistry. Adleman <ref> [Adl94] </ref>, subsequently Lipton [Lip95], demonstrated the possibility of solving difficult problems such as NP-complete problems, typified by Hamilton Path and 3SAT, with the help of parallel processing in liquid phase DNA chemistry. Basic operations of DNA computing are biochemical reactions performed on DNA strands. <p> The result is either true or false. Adleman suggests that this has to be done only at the end of computation, since it can destroy the DNA strands <ref> [Adl94] </ref>. * polymer (A): Polymerizations. Create a complementary strand of each DNA strand in A.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, not many algorithms for NP-complete problems have been developed so far. Only known algorithms are those for Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and 3-Coloring by Bach et al. <ref> [BCGT96] </ref>, with space complexity 2 cn for some c &lt; 1. However, the space complexity of these algorithms is not small enough to transform 1 3SAT.

Reference-contexts: The heavy use of Pure Literal Rule can be justified by a result in <ref> [BFU93] </ref> that a variant of the sequential DPP with only Pure Literal Rule finds a satisfying assignment for most of the formulas with m=n 1:63.

Reference-contexts: This implies that formulas of 120 variables will become within the reach. 1 Boneh and Lipton proposed a solution to this problem for Lipton's 3SAT algorithm <ref> [BL95] </ref>. 2 The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets down some notation and describes Lipton's method. Section 3 presents the implementation of the practical 3SAT algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The first two, whose worst case analysis is yet to be done, have been widely used and studied <ref> [SK96, SML96, Fre96, CA96, GPB82, FP83, BPJ89, JB85] </ref>, while the other three are proven to have time complexity respectively 1:618 n , 1:579 n , and 1:504 n . Among the five, the Davis-Putnam procedure, DPP in short, is the oldest and the others are basically its variants.

Reference-contexts: In order to tackle this issue, we propose to study DNA algorithms for 3SAT because the problem is a logical characterization of NP <ref> [Coo71] </ref>. There are three possible approaches to the problem of designing efficient DNA algorithms for 3SAT: * Use space-efficient DNA algorithms for other NP-complete problems. * Convert known 3SAT algorithms for conventional computers to DNA algorithms. * Develop an algorithm specially designed for DNA computing.

Such expectation may be supported by a result by Purdom and Brown <ref> [JB85] </ref>, that a variant of DPP that uses only pure literal rules is polynomial time on the average if the number of clauses are limited by n ln n. Also, the average ratio seems to become higher if there are fewer clauses. The second figure shows the maximum ratio.

In the original algorithm described in <ref> [MS85] </ref>, both Pure Literal Rule and Unit Clause Rule are implicitly included in their autarchy rule. Since we are to replace DPP's Split Rule, by removing the part corresponding to the two implicit rules, we obtain the following autarchy rule. (case 1) There is a two-literal clause.
