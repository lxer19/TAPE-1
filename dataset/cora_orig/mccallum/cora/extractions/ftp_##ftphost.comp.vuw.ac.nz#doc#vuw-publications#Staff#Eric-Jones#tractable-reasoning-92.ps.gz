Title: Extending Schema-Based Reasoning to Cope with Multiple Descriptions  
Author: Eric K. Jones

Abstract: Understanding natural language frequently requires determining co-reference of different descriptions of the same action or object. Schema-based reasoning is a well-established technology for natural language understanding; existing systems, however, do not cope with this problem in a sufficiently general way. In this paper, we propose to address this deficiency by augmenting a schema-based rea-soner with a special-purpose inference mechanism called redescription inference. Redescrip-tion inference builds on Charniak's notion of abductive unification [ Charniak, 1988 ] . An im plementation is in progress.

Reference-contexts: Membership in a concept is recorded using the predicate Inst. Concept members are called instances of the concept, the concepts they belong to their types. Inference is usually restricted to a small collection of special-purpose methods: for example, abductive unification <ref> [ Charniak, 1988 ] </ref> , property inheritance, and simple forms of dynamic classification such as specialization inference [ Lytinen, 1984 ] . In the literature, these special-purpose inference strategies have been justified on the following grounds: 1. Correspondence with core computational problems of understanding. <p> Abductive unification is a non-monotonic extension of ordinary unification with equality, in which a role (skolem term) of a schema can be hypothesized to be equal to a representation appearing in the input if this equality is consistent with the system's knowledge of the two <ref> [ Charniak, 1988 ] </ref> . Two natural language expressions can co-refer if the object denoted by one is represented as a skolem term, the object denoted by the other is represented as a (possibly non-skolem) term, and the two can be abductively unified. <p> It follows that the coverage of a schema-based understander is going to be constrained by its ability to relate different descriptions of the same object. How well do existing understanding systems perform in this regard? In <ref> [ Charniak, 1988 ] </ref> , Charniak summarizes and formalizes an approach used by a variety of earlier systems (for example, moptrans [ Lytinen, 1984 ] , sam [ Culling-ford, 1977 ] , and pam [ Wilensky, 1978 ] ), using the idea of abductive unification. <p> the financial transaction that indirectly 1 Charniak does not explicitly describe the procedure he uses to prove statements of the form :P (: : :; y; : : :), but a procedure that performed a more sophisticated kind of inference would be inconsistent with the discussion on page 281 of <ref> [ Charniak, 1988 ] </ref> . imply that she would not offer a bribe, but those implications have not already been inferred by the system. (For example, the actor might be known to be honest.) Char-niak describes this approach in slogan form as inferring "identity of indiscernibles." 3.1 The Problem of Sufficient

Reference-contexts: The object of a MoneyTransfer, for example, might denote the money transferred, but the object of a Bribe might denote a person being bribed. There are any number of ways to represent this dependency: Hayes, for example, suggests using a notion of "name-scope" <ref> [ Hayes, 1979 ] </ref> . Two problem remain, however. First, concepts like Bribe and MoneyTransfer cannot be defined so that one subsumes the other without changing the names of slots with conflicting interpretations.

Reference-contexts: If our hypothesis is correct, then the key to success in our endeavor is a tractable mechanism for relating multiple descriptions. In <ref> [ Jones, 1991a ] </ref> we introduced a special-purpose inference mechanism called redescrip-tion inference that may prove sufficient. A prototype implementation of redescription inference was part of the brainstormer system [ Jones, 1991b ] .

Reference-contexts: There are, however, pairs of concepts that we would like to be able to compare, but for which this kind of restriction is much less reasonable. Consider, for example, the following fragment drawn from the MUC-3 test suite of newspaper stories about terrorism in Latin America (see <ref> [ MUC, 1991 ] </ref> ): San Salvador, 2 Apr 90 (AFP) | Official sources have reported that five policemen and a civilian were killed, and at least 24 soldiers injured when a vehicle loaded with explosives exploded on 2 April near a police precinct located on the southwestern outskirts of San

Reference-contexts: For example, abductive unification of a constant in the input with a role (skolem term) causes the two to be asserted equal to one another. This gives rise to a form of "expectation-driven processing" <ref> [ Schank, 1982 ] </ref> , in which roles are expectations: successfully matching an input to an expectation can trigger further inference. For example, from the equality of an input and a role, it follows that all facts previously true of the role are now true of the input.

Recall that abductive unification involves nonmonotonically asserting equality of skolem terms with other terms during matching, if equality can be proven consistent with what the system knows.
