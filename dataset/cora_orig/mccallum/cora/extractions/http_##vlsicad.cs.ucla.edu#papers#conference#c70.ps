Abstract: Academic clock routing research results has often had limited impact on industry practice, since such practical considerations as hierarchical buffering, rise-time and overshoot constraints, obstacle- and legal location-checking, varying layer parasitics and congestion, and even the underlying design flow are often ignored. This paper explores directions in which traditional formulations can be extended so that the resulting algorithms are more useful in production design environments. Specifically, the following issues are addressed: (i) clock routing for varying layer parasitics with nonzero via parasitics; (ii) obstacle-avoidance clock routing; (iii) a new topology design rule for prescribed-delay clock routing; and (iv) predictive modeling of the clock routing itself. We develop new theoretical analyses and heuristics, and present experimental results that validate our new approaches.

Reference-contexts: A. B. Kahng is currently Visiting Scientist (on sabbatical leave from UCLA), and C.-W. A. Tsao is Senior Member of Technical Staff, at Cadence. The BST problem has been previously addressed in <ref> [12, 4, 3] </ref>. The basic Extended DME (Ex-DME) approach extends the DME algorithm [2, 5] via the concept of a merging region, which is a set of embedding points with feasible skew and minimum merging cost if no detour wiring occurs. <p> We now review necessary concepts from <ref> [4, 12, 3] </ref>. For a node v 2 G with children a and b, its merging region, denoted mr (v), is constructed from the so-called joining segments L a 2 mr (a) and L b 2 mr (b), which are the closest boundary segments of mr (a) and mr (b). <p> The set of points with minimum sum of distances to L a and L b form a Shortest Distance Region SDR (L a ; L b ), where the points with skew B (i.e., feasible skew) in turn form the merging region mr (v). It is observed in <ref> [3] </ref> that under Elmore delay each line segment l = p 1 p 2 2 SDR (L a ; L b ) is well-behaved, in that the skew values along l can be either a constant (when L a and L b are Manhattan arcs) or piecewise-linear decreasing, then constant, then <p> This important property enables the merging region mr (v) 2 SDR (L a ; L b ) to be constructed in O (n) time <ref> [3] </ref>. The resulting merging region is a convex polygon bounded by at most 2 Man-hattan arcs and 2 horizontal/vertical segments when L a and L b are Manhattan arcs, or a convex polygon bounded by at most 4n (with arbitrary slopes) segments where n is the number of the sinks. <p> When both L a and L b are rectilinear segments or are two single points sitting on a vertical or horizontal line, only one routing layer is needed for merging mr (a) and mr (b). Thus, the original BME construction rules <ref> [3] </ref> still apply in these cases. Corollary 1 below shows that for non-uniform layer parasitics, joining segments will never be Manhattan arcs of nonzero length. <p> As we can see from Fig. 3, pmr (v) actually consists of several convex polygonal regions. So the number of regions per node may grow exponentially during the bottom-up construction of merging regions (this is the difficulty encountered by the IME method of <ref> [3] </ref>). 4 Our current implementation simply keeps at most k regions with lowest tree cost for each internal node.
