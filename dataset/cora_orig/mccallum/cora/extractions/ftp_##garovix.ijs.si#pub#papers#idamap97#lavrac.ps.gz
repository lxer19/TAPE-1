Abstract: Excessive amounts of knowledge and data stored in medical databases request the development of specialized tools for storing and accessing of data, data analysis, and effective use of stored knowledge and data. This paper first sketches the history of research that led to the development of current intelligent data analysis techniques, aimed at narrowing the increasing gap between data gathering and data comprehension. Next, we present our view on the relation of Intelligent data analysis to Knowledge discovery in databases and Data mining. Finally, we discuss the need for intelligent data analysis in medicine and present the aims of research in this area.

Reference-contexts: The increase in data volume causes greater difficulties in extracting useful information for decision support. The traditional manual data analysis has become insufficient, and methods for efficient computer-based analysis indispensable. From this need, a new interdisciplinary field, that of Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) was born <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> . KDD encompasses statistical, pattern recognition, machine learning, and visualization tools to support the analysis of data and discovery of principles that are encoded within the data. The results of computer-based analysis have to be communicated to humans in an understandable way. <p> The main emphasis of current research is thus on data analysis. This led to the challenging new research areas of Knowledge discovery in databases <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> , Data mining, and Intelligent data analysis, in which machine learning techniques have a major role when the goal of data analysis is knowledge extraction.

Reference-contexts: Recently, however, the situation is changing rapidly: modern hospitals are well equipped with monitoring and other data collection devices, and data is gathered and shared in inter- and intra-hospital information systems. In fact, medical informatics has become a must and an integral part of every successful medical institution <ref> [ 40 ] </ref> . The increase in data volume causes greater difficulties in extracting useful information for decision support. The traditional manual data analysis has become insufficient, and methods for efficient computer-based analysis indispensable.

Reference-contexts: The main problems addressed at this early stage of expert system research concerned knowledge acquisition [ 9; 10 ] , knowledge representation, reasoning and explanation <ref> [ 43 ] </ref> . A typical early expert system schema is shown in Figure 1. Rules were proposed from the early days of knowledge-based systems, and expert systems in particular, as a prime formalism for expressing knowledge in a symbolic way.
