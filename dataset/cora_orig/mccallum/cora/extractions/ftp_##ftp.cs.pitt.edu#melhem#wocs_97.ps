Abstract: Optical interconnection networks have the potential for achieving low latency and high throughput. Moreover, the high bandwidth of an optical link can be shared by many virtual channels through the use of either multiple wavelengths or multiple time slots. In this paper, routing algorithms are studied for mesh-like architectures with path-multiplexed or link-multiplexed communications. Deterministic, adaptive and global routing algorithms are evaluated and compared in terms of the multiplexing degree needed to support random communication requests. fl This work is supported in part by NSF award MIP-9633729

Reference-contexts: In wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), virtual channels are established on the same communication link by transmitting and receiving optical signals on different wavelengths. There are two basic approaches that can be used to establish connections in a point-to-point network multiplexed in time or wavelength <ref> [1, 7, 3, 9, 15, 14, 17] </ref>. One approach is to establish a connection which spans more than one communication link using possibly different channels on each link. This approach is called link multiplexing (LM), and requires wavelength conversion or time-slot interchange capabilities at each node in the network.

Reference-contexts: In these studies, however, the path from a source, s, to a destination, d, was assumed to follow the dimension order routing, which is a simple algorithm often used for circuit switching, packet switching and wormhole switching <ref> [5, 11, 18] </ref>. The main disadvantage of the dimension order routing is that it defines deterministic routes that are independent of the network loading conditions.

Reference-contexts: Communication latency can be reduced by increasing network bandwidth and throughput. However, there is a tradeoff between reducing network latency and increasing implementation cost and complexity. Optical networks have the potential for both reducing latency and increasing throughput <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Specifically, large latencies usually result from the overhead of controlling the network. Given that optical fibers may be used for transmitting terahertz signals, it is reasonable to sacrifice some of this large bandwidth in return for simple and efficient control.

Reference-contexts: Time-division and wavelength division multiplexing techniques increase the number of connections that can be simultaneously established in the network, thus reducing the frequency of control operations, which in turns reduces the network control overhead <ref> [10] </ref>. In time-division multiplexing (TDM), a number of virtual channels can be established on each communication link by dividing the time domain into fixed time slots and establishing each virtual channel during a time slot in a cyclic manner.
