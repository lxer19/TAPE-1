Abstract: An important step from today's robots to autonomous systems is the capability of working in unstructured, partially unknown environments. In such environments objects shall be handled which are not exactly modelled a priori. This paper describes a method based on concept formation learning techniques for the automated acquisition of generic visual object descriptions that describe the important features of a whole class of similar objects.

Reference-contexts: So far generic models are mainly created manually and used for classification [1, 2, 3, 9]. Only few work has been done to learn these models automatically [4, 5]. In this paper the application of concept formation techniques <ref> [6] </ref> is described to acquire a hierarchy of generic object descriptions from a set of 2d-images of the object automatically or by interaction with a teacher. <p> LEARNING The learning goal is to automatically build a model hierarchy from a set of unclassified object-2d-views. The realized learning method is an incremental, inductive concept formation technique, which is a significant extension of the CLASSIT-algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. New features are the use of multi-level representations, structural attributes, integration of supervised learning and a matching algorithm for attributes. Beginning from the root an object-2d-view is integrated into the model descriptions. <p> Goal of that evaluation function is to maximize the similarity among the instances of one model and the differences between different models. A combined measurement is defined <ref> [6] </ref> for the predictiveness and predictability of each attribute in a model in order to result in an overall clustering quality: K X I X J (i) X P (A i = V ij ) fl P (A i = V ij j M k ) fl P (M k j

Reference-contexts: Learning and using generic object descriptions is only one part of a bigger system that is under development at our institute for autonomous learning robots <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION The knowledge representation used for objects is a multi-level attribute-value representation with nominal, numerical and structural values. The basic features vertex, edge and face are described by a set of nominal and numerical attributes. <p> A resulting model hierarchy with labels of the objects learned is presented in figure 5. A couple of other tests concerning the dependency of hierarchy size from cutoff, of learning and classification time from cutoff and combined supervised and unsupervised learning can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. CONCLUSION This paper describes a new technique to automatically build generic object descriptions. Such a component is a basic precondition if autonomous robots shall be able to work in unstructured, partially unknown environments and have to acquire appropriate knowledge for their tasks. <p> The validity of the approach has been shown in several experiments. For a detailed description of the representation, the algorithms and the system architecture as a whole, please refer to <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An object itself is described by a set of 2d-views plus additional object information. The attribute values are determined by a special vision hardware, a couple of feature extraction routines (see <ref> [10] </ref>) or tactile experiments. The description of a model is similar to that of an object, i.e. it consists of a set of model-2d-views, which are represented by a set of basic elements and their relational structure.
