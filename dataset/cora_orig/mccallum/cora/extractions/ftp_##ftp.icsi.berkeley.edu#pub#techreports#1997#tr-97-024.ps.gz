Abstract: Learning is basically a social process. Experiences with Computer Supported Learning (CAL) over the last thirty years have shown that technology cannot substitute for some of the essential elements of this process, e.g. personal communication, face-to-face collaboration, positive and negative reinforcement through fellow students, etc. Today, with local and wide area networks becoming a reality, there seems to be a chance to simulate some elements of this learning process by a suitable combination of synchronous and asynchronous collaboration techniques. In particular, this paper proposes ways of supporting this interaction within a consistent, representation-independent complex object model. To map the model onto affordable technologies we borrow structures and methods from both database research and current multi-media course development. The arguments for the suitability of our approach, keeping in mind that distance learning remains a necessity in many circumstances, are supported with a number of examples.

Reference-contexts: If everything fails, using a tinted or otherwise marked glass board over the displayed object could be used although this would violate our display independence principle. 6 Concurrency and Collaboration Within the framework sketched above we can now achieve event broadcasting as against display broadcasting. In <ref> [3] </ref> these terms are coined in connection with collaboration transparency achievable in JAVA although it is not clear to us why it wouldnt support collaboration awareness as well.

Reference-contexts: Fingers then operate on data previously distributed, say during the night over low bandwidth lines, or off-line via CD-ROM. Together with finger movements updates, patches, annotations and work-sheets are distributed which alter the tree in a limited way and which require little bandwidth. Gemmell and Bell <ref> [7] </ref> point this out in 16 their request for efficient support for animation and special effects in slide shows: It doesnt take many bits to define a polygon and say y from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). <p> Other aspects, like lock discovery mechanisms, check-in/check-out mechanisms, name space management, version control, queuing of requests, roles, sub-groups, private discussions, speed-up, slow-down, repeat, moderator selection, back and side channels for communication, have been mentioned e.g. in <ref> [7, 8] </ref> but are skipped here for lack of space. We close this Section with a scenario for the example above. The scenario uses the techniques just introduced. Example 3 Collaboration Scenario Mary, John and Barbara have teamed up to form a learning for the course Distributed Software Engineering.

Reference-contexts: This also opens questions of transmitting and storing metadata, e.g. type information. This is also introduced in [12] as a topic to consider in collaborative authoring and versioning and for which no generally agreed protocol exists today. In <ref> [10] </ref> it appears as course templates which are document grammars that define the structure of courses. These templates are needed to achieve homogeneous course components which opens the possibility of exchanging these building blocks in an electronic educational market.

Reference-contexts: Usual cut-and-paste operations will transfer this object into the object tree at a location marked by a destination finger. Given type compatibility, the object is transferred and replaces the destination object. This also opens questions of transmitting and storing metadata, e.g. type information.
