Abstract: In this paper, we propose the QCLICS algorithm for quality-controlled JPEG compression of image sets. Lossy compression of images results in a tradeoff between compression and quality: the greater the compression, the poorer the reulting image quality. Quality-controlled compression has two goals: meeting the desired compression/quality specification accurately, and optimizing the compression-quality tradeoff. When a large set of images is to be compressed into a limited amount of disk space, it is desirable to optimize the compression-quality tradeoff for individual images as well as across images. This is an important issue in multimedia CD-ROM production, where hundreds or thousands of digital images need to be compressed to fit in the available space. The QCLICS algorithm uses the RD-OPT algorithm [RL95, RL96] for optimizing JPEG quantization tables for individual images, and uses a dynamic programming strategy to apportion the target compression/quality to the individual images. The complexity overhead of optimizing across the images is minimal, while significant gains in compression/quality are obtained. QCLICS offers flexibility in choosing the image

Several lossy image compression techniques are in common use, the most popular one being the JPEG standard [PM93].

Each spatial frequency coefficient is stored with a certain degree of accuracy, which can be varied to vary the extent of compression or quality.

Let the sum of the number of pixels in each plane (Y, Cb, and Cr) after preprocessing be P . The uncompressed image size (after preprocessing) is P bytes. <p> Naive choices of compression parameters may result in sub-optimal rate-quality tradeoffs [RL94].

For JPEG, the compression parameters are the quantization table and the thresholding strategy [PM93, RL96, CR95].

All constraints and targets are satisfied within these tolerances. Note that after the dynamic programming step, any target rate/quality is readily obtained for the given constraints.
