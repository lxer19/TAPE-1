Abstract: This paper appears in ACM Symposium on Principles Of Programming Languages (POPL), Charleston, Jan 1993, Abstract We present a new model, based on monads, for performing input/output in a non-strict, purely functional language. It is composable, extensible, efficient, requires no extensions to the type system, and extends smoothly to incorporate mixed-language working and in-place array updates. pp71-84. This copy corrects a few minor typographical errors in the published version.
