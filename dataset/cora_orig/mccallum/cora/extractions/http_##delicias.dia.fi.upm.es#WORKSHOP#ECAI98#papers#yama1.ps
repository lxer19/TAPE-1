Abstract: When one expert system becomes an impasse in solving problems alone, how can it get information available to improve itself from other expert systems ? This paper presents the interoperation environment to support the process. First, inference primitive structure templates have been presented to share inference structures among all expert systems. Next, the cooperation method has been presented, using the difference arising in the context of the correspondence between inference primitives of an originator and those of recipients. The wrapper with conversion facilities has been also provided, using a common domain ontology developed manually. After designing and implementing such an inter-operation environment, experiments have been done among the following expert systems: a diagnosis ( trouble-shooting ) expert system , a scheduling ( electric power maintenance job scheduling ) expert system , a design ( elevator design ) expert system and a consultation ( financial management ) expert system. Furthermore, in a deep interoperation experiment, it has been shown that financial management expert system get a refined inference structure and find some way to perform a given task better by the interoperation among other three expert systems.

Reference-contexts: In order to modularize such expert system deep inter-operation, two issues remains cooperation (coordination) and communication among expert systems. 4 Expert System 3.1 Cooperation for Distributed Expert Systems 3.1.1 Shared Specification Work made on cooperation to date has been divided into two different approaches, direct communication and assisted coordination in <ref> [M.R.Genesereth et al.,1994] </ref>. The former includes the contract-net approach and specification sharing (SS), which are proper in small scale cooperation. The latter includes a facilitator and a mediator , which are better in large scale cooperation.

Reference-contexts: Itoh's work 10 [M.Kawaguchi and T.Itoh,1993] proposes a framework of cooperative distributed diagnostic expert systems, based on a proposed self-re-organizational scheme. However, these systems try to deal with issues at a syntactic level and without the management of semantics. On the other hand, R.Dieng's work <ref> [Rose Dieng ,1994] </ref> manages issues in cooperative knowledge-based systems.

Reference-contexts: The information must be lifted from the implementation details to some proper conceptual details acceptable to be exchanged. 1 In the field of knowledge engineering, the methodology has recently been de-veloped to specify the semantics of expert systems free from implementation details. Common KADS <ref> [J.Breuker and W.Van de Velde ,1994] </ref> is a well-organized knowledge library which provide inference primitives called canonical functions, such as Select, Compare, Merge,etc. We also added other three functions in order to express inference engine exactly (Propagate: propagation of qualitative value , Replace, Predict: simulation).

Reference-contexts: The troubleshooting expert system called Knowledge Complier II <ref> [T.Yamaguchi et al. ,1992] </ref> is a kind of hybrid model-based diagnosis system that uses both the model-based 2 process and the heuristics (surface causal association)-based process. Furthermore, the model-based process has been divided into the following two sub-processes: faulty components identification (FCI) and fault nanalysis from faulty components (FAFC).

Reference-contexts: Having a side effect, advices for 3 problem is selected. Thus, suggestion, simulation and modification make up the whole process in elevetor consultation expert system. The enterprise diagnosis expert system called FIMCOES <ref> [Pedro Garcia del Valle y Duran and T.Yamaguchi ,1994] </ref> performs the task by constraint satisfaction over a set of equations of financial indices combined with a best-first search solver.
