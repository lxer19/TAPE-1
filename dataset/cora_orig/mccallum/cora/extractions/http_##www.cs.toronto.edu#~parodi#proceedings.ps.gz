Abstract: This paper investigates the computational time complexity of the labeling problem for line drawings of polyhedral scenes. It is found that line drawings can be labeled in time proportional to the number of segments once the vanishing points associated to the possible directions for the edges are known. The vanishing points can be given a priori, otherwise can, in many cases, be detected by standard techniques from the line drawing itself. The NP-completeness of the labeling problem for line drawings of trihedral scenes (Kirousis and Papadimitriou, 1988) is then due to the lack of knowledge about the vanishing points, which is equivalent to the knowledge of the possible directions for the edges. These results help draw a more accurate boundary between the problems in the interpretation of line drawings that are polynomially solvable and those that are NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: He found that the satis-fiability of these conditions is equivalent to a problem of linear programming and can therefore be checked in polynomial time (O (n 3:5 )); Kirousis and Papadi-mitriou <ref> [6] </ref> have shown that the labeling problem for a line drawing of trihedral, solid polyhedral scenes is NP-complete, while the same problem can be solved in linear time for line drawings of Legoland scenes (3D edges oriented according to three possible orthogonal directions). <p> The vanishing points can be given a priori (for example if we have a finite set of possible directions or can be computed from the image itself by standard techniques (see for example [8]).

The scene is composed by solid, trihedral, opaque polyhedra (the N P -completeness of the labeling problem was proved in <ref> [6] </ref> under these hypotheses). Our further hypothesis is that we have a finite set of possible vanishing points, fV P 1 ; : : : V P n g, associated to the possible directions for the edges of the polyhedral scene. <p> By Proposition 2, the most complicated case is when there is just one horizon line and both end-junctions are L (&lt;)'s. 5 Labelling and boolean equations As suggested by previous classical papers ([1], <ref> [6] </ref>) the labeling problem can be solved by associating to the line drawing L a boolean expression F L which is satisfiable if-f L is labelable. <p> are related to previous work on the interpretation of line drawings; we then discuss the relevance of our algorithm for computer vision, and some possible extensions of our approach. 6.1 Relation to previous work In the paper in which they proved the NP-completeness for the labeling problem, Kirousis & Papadimitriou <ref> [6] </ref> also proved that when the line drawing represents Legoland scenes the labeling problem can be solved in linear time. <p> The NP-completeness of the labeling problem (<ref> [6] </ref>) seems to compromise the possibility of achieving such a task effectively. To face this situation, one can look for good heuristics (Waltz [10]) or for a meaningful restriction of the problem that is no more NP-complete. This is the approach followed in [6] (re-striction to Legoland scenes) and in [7] (restriction to the case in which we know a connecting segment for every Y -junction), and also in our paper (restriction to the case in which the location of vanishing points is known). Our assumption covers several useful scenarios. <p> Our assumption covers several useful scenarios. A possible scenario is when we have a world of polyhedra whose edges can have a finite number of possible directions, as in <ref> [6] </ref> (in that case such number was three). In this case the vanishing points are given a priori. Another scenario is when we do not know the vanishing points a priori, but we are somehow able to compute them from the image itself. This is possible in many cases. <p> This is possible in many cases.

We just summarize the results in the following Proposition 2 Let = (s 1 ; s 2 ; : : : s n ) be an L-chain. <p> When a boolean variable is assigned both to s 1 and s n , two cases must be considered: If s 1 and s n are collinear, then (see <ref> [7] </ref>) p 2 () is connecting for s 1 if-f p 2 () is connecting for s n , so we have ff (s 1 ) = ff (s n ), which can also be written in 2-CNF (conjunctive normal form with no more than two variables for each clause) as <p> Our work can be thought of as an extension of this result: we have an arbitrary number of known possible directions instead of three, and we consider perspective instead of orthographic projections of polyhedra. Our work is also related to the work by Kirousis <ref> [7] </ref>. In that paper he gave some constraints concerning L-chains additional to the ones by Clowes and Huffman which the labeling of a line drawing must satisfy in order for the line drawing to be realizable. <p> To face this situation, one can look for good heuristics (Waltz [10]) or for a meaningful restriction of the problem that is no more NP-complete.
