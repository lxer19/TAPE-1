Abstract: Gauge invariance is used to establish an equivalence relation between solutions of the time-independent and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations that describe the same physical state of a superconductor. The equivalence relation shows how equilibrium configurations are obtained as large-time asymptotic limits of solutions of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we establish the equivalence relation. In Section 5, we analyze the large-time asymptotic limit of a solution of the TDGL equations in the "OE = !(r A)" gauge. 2 Ginzburg-Landau Model of Superconductivity In the Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions <ref> [1] </ref>, the state of a superconductor is described by a complex-valued order parameter and a real vector-valued vector potential A. The order parameter can be thought of as the wave function for the center-of-mass motion of the "superelectrons" (Cooper pairs), whose density is n s = j j 2 .

Uniqueness is achieved by choosing a gauge and thus constraining the solution to a specified manifold in the solution space. A common choice is the London gauge <ref> [4, Chapter 4] </ref>, where O is a solution of Poisson's equation, O = r A in , satisfying the Neumann condition n rO = n A on @. In this gauge, the vector potential is divergence free in and tangential at the boundary @.

Reference-contexts: It is not possible to satisfy both the zero-electric potential gauge and the London gauge in simultaneously at all times, but one can choose O so OE = r A in at all times. Again, the particular choice is made to suit the problem under investigation. For example, Du <ref> [8] </ref> chose the zero-electric potential, while Chen, Hoffmann, and Liang [9] used the "OE = r A" gauge to prove existence and uniqueness for the TDGL equations.
