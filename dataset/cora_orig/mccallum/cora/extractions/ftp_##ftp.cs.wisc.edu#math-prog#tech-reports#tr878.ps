Title: PATTERN RECOGNITION VIA LINEAR PROGRAMMING THEORY AND APPLICATION TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS  
Author: O.L. MANGASARIANy, R. SETIONO AND W.H. WOLBERG 
Date: REVISED MAY 18, 1990  
Abstract: A decision problem associated with a fundamental nonconvex model for linearly inseparable pattern sets is shown to be NP-complete. Another nonconvex model that employs an 1 norm instead of the 2-norm, can be solved in polynomial time by solving 2n linear programs, where n is the (usually small) dimensionality of the pattern space. An effective LP-based finite algorithm is proposed for solving the latter model. The algorithm is employed to obtain a noncon-vex piecewise-linear function for separating points representing measurements made on fine needle aspirates taken from benign and malignant human breasts. A computer program trained on 369 samples has correctly diagnosed each of 45 new samples encountered and is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. 1. Introduction. The fundamental problem we wish to address is that of

Reference-contexts: The solution c = 0 is unique for this problem, and hence no useful plane is generated that minimizes some error criterion. Similarly, Grinold stated <ref> [2, Theorem (iii)] </ref> that if for a solution (c; fl; ) of the linear program (2.8), 0, then (c; fl) "defines a hyperplane that minimizes the maximum error".

Reference-contexts: When applied to the diagnosis of breast cancer the method completely separated 369 points in R 9 into 201 points belonging to a benign category and 168 points belonging to a malignant category (Section 4).

We describe now how the ideas of the previous section were applied to generate a discriminant function, for the diagnosis of breast cancer <ref> [11] </ref>, which is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The discriminant function constructed is based on Algorithm 3.3 applied to 369 points in the nine-dimensional real space R 9 . Each point represents nine measurements made on a fine needle aspirate (fna) taken from a patient's breast.

Reference-contexts: All 45 new sample points encountered after the construction of the discriminant function were classified correctly, with 44 of the points being classified by the first pair of parallel planes and the 45th point by the second pair of parallel planes. In contrast to our approach, statistically based schemes <ref> [12] </ref> failed to obtain complete separation of the 369 sample points. Similarly, the linear programming formulation of Smith (2.6) can be employed in Step (i) of Algorithm 3.3 as a replacement for the 2n linear programs (3.5).
