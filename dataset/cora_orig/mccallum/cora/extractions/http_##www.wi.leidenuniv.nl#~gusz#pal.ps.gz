Abstract: This paper contains results of a research project aiming at modelling the phenomenon of customer retention. Historical data from a database of a big mutual fund investment company have been analyzed with three techniques: logistic regression, rough data models, and genetic programming. Models created by these techniques were used to gain insights into factors influencing customer behaviour and to make predictions on ending the relationship with the company in question. Because the techniques were applied independently of each other, it was possible to make a comparison of their basic features in the context of data mining.

Reference-contexts: We used three indices for judging the results: 1. R 2 logistic regression , which can be interpreted as the proportional reduction of the lack-of-fit by incorporating the variable of interest above a model based only on the intercept parameter <ref> (Agresti, 1990) </ref>. It is defined as: R 2 logistic regression = 1 log (likelihood intercept+variable )) log (likelihood intercept ) : 2. logistic regression , which can be interpreted as the proportional reduction of errors in classification by incorporating the variable of interest above a model with only an intercept.

Reference-contexts: We verified the meaningfulness of the recodings in two ways. Firstly, by a verification of non-uniformness of each bar chart with each bar representing the relative frequency of stoppers. Secondly, by a two-dimensional correspondence analysis <ref> (Krzanowski 1993) </ref> in order to study the placing of the categories in one-dimensional space in relation to stoppers and non-stoppers categories. Modelling Customer Retention 5 3.3 Simple logistic regressions We carried out ten logistic regressions, one for each variable. We used three indices for judging the results: 1.

Reference-contexts: A model with only an intercept classifies all clients in the group with the largest observed frequency, being the non-stoppers in the present case. This means that all stoppers are misclassified and regarded as errors <ref> (see, e.g., Menard, 1995) </ref>. So it is defined as: logistic regression = #errors intercept #errors intercept+variable #errors intercept : 3. fl logistic regression , which can be interpreted as a measure of ordinal association between the predicted probabilities of being a stopper and actually being a stopper.
