Abstract: Data from several new experiments will allow the physics of B meson decays to be studied in greater detail than currently possible. It is important to have a simulation of the underlying physics processes that is able to accurately describe this data. The EvtGen package, written in C++, provides a framework for implementation of physics processes relevant to decays of B mesons and other resonances. The framework includes tools needed to easily handle sequential decays, correctly simulating angular distributions, including their correlations. Individual physics processes are implemented in modules that allow users to build complicated decay chains from simple pieces. Each module calculates decay amplitudes, to be used by the framework to generate the correct kinematic distributions. In particular, EvtGen provides implementations of many detailed decays, including a variety of semileptonic decay models and time dependent CP asymmetries in neutral B meson decays, as well as a decay table for simulation of generic B decays. Both BaBar and CLEO are now using this package in their simulation of B meson decays.

Reference-contexts: There are approximately 60 models implemented that simulate a large variety of physics processes. This short document can only outline some of the functionality of this package. For a more detailed description of what is implemented and how the generator works see Ref. <ref> [3] </ref>. FIGURE 1. The top diagram defines the angles in the decay B !

Reference-contexts: In the case of the SVV HELAMP model these arguments specify the helicity amplitudes. In BaBar, a complete decay table for B physics is used. The left plot in Figure 4 shows the inclusive lepton energy spectrum produced by the BaBar decay table compared with the inclusive CLEO spectrum <ref> [5] </ref>. In our effort to provide a complete decay table, many models needed for generic B decays are included in the EvtGen package. For semileptonic decays, these models include the ISGW2 [6], HQET, and Goity and Roberts [7] form factor models.
