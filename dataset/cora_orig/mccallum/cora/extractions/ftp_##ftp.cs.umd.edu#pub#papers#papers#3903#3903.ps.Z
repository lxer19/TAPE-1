Title: Fast Evaluation of Ensemble Transients of Large IP Networks

Abstract: We extend a numerical approximate solution method (the Z-iteration) to time-dependent open networks of M(t)/M(t)/1/1 and M(t)/M(t)/1/K queues, and apply the method to obtain transient performance metrics of large IP networks. The method generates a set of coupled differential equations, one for each queue in the network. The equations are numerically unstable under certain conditions (e.g., large bandwidths and buffers), and we present techniques to overcome this problem. The resulting numerical procedure is accurate and very fast. For example, a 20-second evolution for a 1000-node network with high-speed links ( 10 4 packets/sec) and large buffers ( 10 4 packets) was obtained in 18 minutes on an Ultra Sparc, whereas simulation would take days.

Reference-contexts: We used the Transit-Stub model in the GT-ITM (Georgia Tech Internetwork Topology Models) <ref> [1] </ref> to generate the network topoplogies. The network of 52 nodes is displayed in Figure 7. Figures 8 and 9 show the evolution of the instantaneous queue size at various links. Each figure has two curves, one obtained by the Z-iteration and one by averaging 5 simulation runs.

Reference-contexts: What is available, however, are functions expressing N , B, and U in terms of the steady-state traffic intensity (= =). We denote these functions by F N (), F B (), and F U (), respectively. For example, for a M/M/1/1 queue we have <ref> [2] </ref> N = F N () = 1 (t) instantaneous arrival rate at time t (t) instantaneous service rate at time t N (t) instantantaneous average queue size at time t B (t) instantaneous blocking probability at time t U (t) instantaneous utilization at time t z (t) instantaneous virtual traffic <p> B steady-state blocking probability U steady-state utilization F N () function yielding N in terms of F B () function yielding B in terms of F U () function yielding U in terms of Table 1: Notation B = F B () = 0 For a M=M=1=K queue, we have <ref> [2] </ref>: N = F N () = 1 (K + 1) (K+1) B = F B () = 1 (K+1) K 1 K For M/M/1/1, we can invert F N () and so obtain B and U in terms of N , specifically, B = 0 and U = N=(N +

Reference-contexts: Government. 1 The Z-iteration is an attempt to address this problem. It is a numerical approximate solution method that yields the time evolution of ensemble metrics (e.g. instantaneous queue size distribution) at a cost several orders cheaper than simulation. The first version of the Z-iteration <ref> [3, 4] </ref> handled single multi-class multi-resource queues, adequate for analyzing connection-oriented networks with strict access control and resource reservation.

Reference-contexts: Applying regular solving methods to the differential equations as stated above will produce an incorrect answer or no answer at all, and applying stiff equation solvers will produce a correct answer but extremely slowly (for a good coverage of differential equation solvers, see <ref> [5] </ref>). In this section, we describe how to overcome these problems for networks of M (t)/M (t)/1/K queues. Consider the differential equation (10).
