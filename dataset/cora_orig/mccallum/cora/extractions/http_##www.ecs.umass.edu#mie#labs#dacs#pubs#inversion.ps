Abstract: This paper describes an application of multiv ariable Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) to a robust performance design of a compact disc mechanism. Robust control design is based on new QFT design algorithms which do not involve loop transmission inversion found in present QFT design algorithms. Their advantage is that even when the designer prefers inversion-based QFT loop shaping, the associated bounds can still be computed more efficiently using our inversion-free design algorithms. Plant uncertainty consists of parametric variations in the natural frequencies of dominant mechanical resonances and a variation in the interaction between the focus and radial loops. Robust performance specifications were given in terms of the multivariable closed-loop sensitivity function. The QFT controller was implemented in an experimental setup.

Reference-contexts: A single-loop QFT design was subsequently carried out and implemented in the radial loop using the raw experimental frequency response data (since with QFT the designer can work directly with complex data). The new design did not exhibit such peaks <ref> (Chait et al., 1994) </ref>. CONCLUSIONS This paper presented new multivariable QFT design algorithms with improved numerical efficiency and their application to control design of a compact disc mechanism.

Reference-contexts: If done carefully, the LU factorization can be used to get P -1 with 4n 3 /3 more operations, for a total of 2n 3 floating point operations. These are only estimates and can be quite inaccurate for small n, say n&lt;10 <ref> ( Dongarra et al., 1979) </ref>. The general estimate is cubic polynomial in n. In addition, the number of operations is much larger for complex matrices (e.g., those representing the frequency response). In MATLAB, for example, a good indication for the number of operations are flops.

Reference-contexts: The CD plant consists of 325 elements, hence numerical efficiency is an issue to be dealt with. Finally, we note that in problems with n 3 and low-order plants, one can compute P -1 by hand without difficulty, or even resort to symbolic programs <ref> (Sating et al., 1993) </ref>. This approach is quite reasonable and was used successfully is numerous examples. However, in many plants, the dynamics include several resonances (e.g., mechanical or acoustical plants), a fact which significantly increases the plant order.

Reference-contexts: The maximum allowable track-following error is 0.1 m m and the actuator current i rad should have a high roll-off above the bandwidth to prevent amplification of audible noise generated by the actuator. The control design problem here is based on a frequency domain formulation for the above specifications <ref> (Steinbuch et al., 1992) </ref>. 3 DESIGN PROBLEM Nominal Dynamics. Only modeling details necessary to explain the QFT control design procedure are described here. A complete description of the nominal model and uncertainty modeling is given in Steinbuch et al. (1992).
