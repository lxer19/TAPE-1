Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of global stabilization of linear discrete time systems by means of bounded feedback laws. The main result proved is an analog of one proved for the continuous time case by the authors, and shows that such stabilization is possible if and only if the system is stabilizable with arbitrary controls and the transition matrix has spectral radius less or equal to one. The proof provides in principle an algorithm for the construction of such feedback laws, which can be implemented either as cascades or as parallel connections ("single hidden layer neural networks") of simple saturation functions.

Reference-contexts: that the solution of (1.1) converges to zero. (It turns out, and in fact follows also from the results to be given, that if this property holds for some such U then it also holds for every U which contains the origin in its interior.) Now, it is known (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>) that a system is ANCBC if and only if (1) the pair (A; B) is stabilizable or "asycontrollable" in the usual unconstrained sense (equivalently, the rank of [I A; B] is n for all complex with jj 1, cf. e.g. [5], exercise 4.4.7) and (2) the spectral radius of A <p> So if jx (t)j 3, then jx (t + 1)j jx (t) (x (t) ~v (t)) + v (t)j + je (t)j jx (t)j : Thus there is some t 0 so that jx (t 0 )j 3. However, the interval <ref> [3; 3] </ref> is invariant: it follows from the equation and the fact that ffi=3 that jx (t + 1)j 3 whenever jx (t)j 3. So lim sup t!+1 jx (t)j 3.

[3]) that a system is ANCBC if and only if (1) the pair (A; B) is stabilizable or "asycontrollable" in the usual unconstrained sense (equivalently, the rank of [I A; B] is n for all complex with jj 1, cf. e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>, exercise 4.4.7) and (2) the spectral radius of A is less or equal to one. This provides an elegant algebraic solution of the open-loop question. <p> We first prove (i). If = 1 or = 1 is an eigenvalue of A, then there exists a nonzero n-dimensional row vector v such that vA = v. It follows from the Hautus condition for controllability (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>, Lemma 3.3.7) that vb 6= 0; thus, we may normalize v so that vb = , which we assume from now on. <p> Assume without loss of generality that the first column b 1 of B is nonzero and consider the Kalman controllability decomposition of the system 1 : x (t + 1) = Ax (t) + b 1 u 1 (t) (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>, Lemma 3.3.3).

Because we restricted attention to a special type of saturation functions, the argument is substantially simpler than that in the cited paper.
