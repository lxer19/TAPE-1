Abstract: To explain complex phenomena, an explanation system must be able to select information from a formal representation of domain knowledge, organize the selected information into multi- sentential discourse plans, and realize the discourse plans in text. Although recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of sophisticated computational mechanisms for explanation, empirical results have been limited. This paper reports on a seven year effort to empirically study explanation generation from semantically rich, large-scale knowledge bases. We first describe Knight, a robust explanation system that constructs multi-sentential and multi-paragraph explanations from the Biology Knowledge Base, a large-scale knowledge base in the domain of botanical anatomy, physiology, and development. We then introduce the Two Panel evaluation methodology and describe how Knight's performance was assessed with this methodology in the most extensive empirical evaluation conducted on an explanation system. In this evaluation, Knight scored within "half a grade" of domain experts, and its performance exceeded that of one of the domain experts.

Reference-contexts: The planner attaches the views to the explanation plan; they become the plan's leaves. Planning is complete when the explanation planner has traversed the entire EDP. The planner passes the resulting explanation plan to a realization component for translation to natural language. The realizer, Fare <ref> (Callaway & Lester 1995) </ref>, is built on top of a unification-based surface generator with a large systemic grammar (Elhadad 1991). Ex- planation generation terminates when Fare has translated all of the views in the explanation plan to natural language.

Reference-contexts: Per- haps its most important contribution lies in its evaluation methodology. With regard to evaluation, it is perhaps most closely related to five NLG projects that have been empirically evaluated: Pauline (Hovy 1990), Edge <ref> (Cawsey 1992) </ref>, the Example Genera- tor (Mittal 1993), Ana (Kukich 1983), and Streak (Robin 1994).

Example Behavior To illustrate the behavior of the system, consider the concept of embryo sac formation.
